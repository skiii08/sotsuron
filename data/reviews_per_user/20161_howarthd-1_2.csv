"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," across the desert in drag
","A hilarious adventure of 3 gay entertainers trekking across the desert of Austrailia, in a recycled tour bus (Priscilla). The bus, like the occupants, underwent a metamorphosis. The story revolves around Tick (one of the three main characters)and his attempt to reconnect with his estranged wife and son. Tick brings along two of his closest friends (Bernadette/Ralph and Felicia/Adam)as they journey to the center of the Northern Territory. At the beginning of the story the characters find themselves at odds. But as the story evolves the characters find themselves embracing each others differences. Each character appears to be at a crossroad in his/her life. And by the end of the movie life-changing decisions have been made. Ome of our favorite minor characters is Tick's son who exhibits amazing tolerance for the different life styles that are shown throughout the movie. Most eight-year old's (and adults) just don't think that way! The Academy Award for costuming was well-deserved. They were definitely over-the-top. The movie is well made and shows the more realistic sides of drag queens and portrays them as people instead of stereotypes.",7,4,8,1 May 2007
The Commitments," A musical (soul) flashback to the 70's and 80's
","The Commitments is a hilarious blend of the ups and downs of an emerging soul band in north Dublin, Ireland. It contains fantastic soul selections from some of the giants. The fact that the actors were real musicians made the personal dynamics seem more realistic. The movie also gives a very accurate portrayal of the lives of the young working class of Dublin before the boom of the 90's. Anyone who has ever thought of being in a band should see this movie. And everyone whose been in a band can relate wholeheartedly to the characters, events and melodrama. Overall this is a great movie with a wonderful soundtrack. A must see. (Because of thick Irish accent it should probably be seen more than once)",8,5,10,1 May 2007
