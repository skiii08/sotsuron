Blade Runner 2049," Ponderous, bloated, long, boring....and completely empty.
","I want to start out by saying that the original 'Blade Runner' is one of my all-time favorite movies. I went into 'Blade Runner 2049' with genuine anticipation, excitement, and a 100% positive attitude. I really wanted to like it....Simply put, this film was nothing but superficial, meaningless, monotonous eye candy. I was getting horribly bored 45 minutes into it, and yet it just went on and on and on for more than two additional hours.. It was as if the production crew worked so hard to capture the visuals, sound, and tone of the original...and to bring in Harrison Ford and Edward James Olmos...they forgot (or lacked the budget)to concoct a story.This was one of the most painfully boring movies I have ever sat through....and certainly the biggest disappointment.I will admit the visuals were well done....but the 'booom...BOOOM'...soundtrack....engaging in the first 'Blade Runner'....was just annoying here. In fact, the interesting visuals were the only reason I did not give this film a '1'...it definitely deserves it.I was panicking midway through the movie...I was by then agonizingly bored...and I could not envision how....when...it would ever end. It really, truly, is that bad.'Blade Runner 2049' currently has the inflated shill IMDb reviews that most big-budget releases start out with....but take my word. Once more people see this film, the truth will come out and I would wager it will be gone from the theaters in less than two weeks.Please...do yourself a huge favor....skip it!***I wanted to add after submitting this review***I find it amusing the people giving this movie positive reviews, who are more or less insulting the opinions of those who did not like it. I don't mean the shills who gave the film a positive review because they are biased or have a financial interest....I'm talking about those who think liking this movie makes them 'deeper' and smarter...they get the deep mystery and meaning of the movie and those who disliked it do not.This is ridiculous and reeks of elitism...there is nothing 'deep' in Blade Runner 2049. The movie is just too long and boring to support an almost non-existent story, it's that simple.",3,41,89,5 October 2017
Sucker Punch," Very bad movie, actually offensive in many ways.
","Where to begin? A few of the 'positive' reviews on IMDb made vague references that this was a 'deep' film, with complex underlying meaning. I call baloney.This movie in my opinion would only appeal to either 15 year old virginal male video game players, or to older males who are stuck in that period of development. When this film ended, I almost felt sort of 'lessened' because I had sat through the movie and paid to see it.The film makes no sense, it was just a jumbled excuse to combine scantily clap 'attractive' young women with video game special effects. In this film, the only people of any worth or merit were the scantily clad young women (all of them attractive of course) who featured in it. And of course the film did nothing but exploit their appearance....The only reason I did not give the movie a '1', was because some of the effects were slightly interesting in a 'video game put on film' sort of way.I don't want to take a lot of time trying to explain why this film was so bad. Trust me, it is bad, it is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer, and if you sit through it you will feel slightly 'dirty' when you leave. Having heard that, if you still decide to see it, at least I tried to warn you.....",2,4,11,30 March 2011
Ready Player One," Watchable...barely...but pretty mediocre.
","Basically a very predictable and contrived movie.The film relies largely on visuals to fill in for the thin plot and sketchy character development. Trouble is, unless your are an AVID video game player, many of the visuals will not be very interesting to you. It also cashes in on nostalgia from a few classic movies from the past....most notably 'The Shining'. Some may enjoy this....I didn't particularly.Most of all, this film is not very original. It is another 'video game players use their skills to save the world' flick. If you imagine a composite of 'The Matrix' and 'Tron'....but with an tone and level of engagement more like 'Tron'....you will have a pretty good idea what to expect.I don't really recommend it unless you are a hardcore gamer...and maybe not even then. A bland, shallow, largely boring movie.",5,2,6,1 April 2018
Horrible Bosses," Over the top....but FUNNY. Worth seeing.
","This is a funny movie, particularly in the first third.The beginning of the movie is down to earth, and we get an amusing portrayal of the 'bosses from hell' that the protagonists have to deal with (although I would be willing to give employment a try for the Jennifer Aniston character). This is also the best part of the movie, because the responses of the central characters are most believable as well.The movie drags a bit in the middle as some impossibly unlikely situations appear, and the ending is completely over the top, but it still manages to offer sufficient laughs to be worthwhile. So who cares? The movie succeeds at what it tries to do, and it is worth seeing for that reason. Just don't expect high art from this film....",7,0,0,28 July 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Mediocre at BEST....no....it's simply bad.
","I really wanted to like this movie. After all the terrible superhero movies that have been released lately, I was somehow hoping that 'Captain America' would be different. It wasn't.I liked the idea of the idealistic but physically weak protagonist who was impossibly patriotic, but beyond that the movie completely fails. I have never understood why superhero movies always feel the need to go completely over the top with outrageous super-villains. In this film Hugo Weaving plays Red Skull. The Red Skull mask looks like something a kid would wear for Halloween...it's that cheesy. Red Skull is apparently possessed with powers similar to Captain America, but also has at his disposal an army of minions with very advanced (and largely unexplained) technology weapons. Yet, these laser beam style weapons seem to do nothing for them.I guess I don't get it. Would it not have been enough for Captain America to simply be involved in fighting the Nazi juggernaut portrayed in a fashion similar to what history recorded? Wouldn't the Nazis be adequate villains for anyone? If I seem to be dwelling on this issue, it is because for me the silly, cheesy 'bad guys' really ruined this movie.The movie also fails because it is obvious from the beginning that Captain America is basically invulnerable. It is very clear early on that nothing is going to happen to him. I was under the impression that his 'powers' consisted of nothing more than being extremely strong and athletic, yet his antics in the movie remind one more of Superman. Captain America's shield certainly cannot shield everything, yet the protagonist is apparently completely immune to the effects of gunfire and laser blasts. Yawn. Even Superman had his kryptonite....I imagine the superhero formula is more difficult to pull off than it might appear, and this movie fails yet again. It is largely silly and boring.I would recommend that you skip it.",3,179,348,28 July 2011
Hugo," Gorgeous Spectacle...but that's all
","'Hugo' provides a gorgeous spectacle of a 1930s Paris that never existed. The sets and scenery (nearly all computer generated I imagine) are simply beautiful, and I imagine it was the previews of these scenes that prompted me to see the film. An 8.6 IMDb review probably didn't hurt either, although I definitely should know better by now to take that with a grain of salt.The story however, was painfully weak and boring. I dozed off a couple of times during the movie, simply because nothing was happening. The gorgeous visuals alone are not sufficient to carry a more than two hour long movie.The imagery and tone of the film suggest initially that something magical and dramatic is eventually going to happen...but it never does. The 'story' just plods on and on (did I mention it was loooong?) to a completely disappointing climax. Actually, there really was no climax...the film just sort of 'ends'.'Hugo' is really only worth seeing if you think you would enjoy sitting for two hours taking in a portrayal of 1930s Paris that looks like it came from a Thomas Kincaid painting. There are some interesting characters thrown in....I enjoyed Sacha Baron-Cohen's portrayal of the Station Inspector....but there is nowhere near enough substance in the story to support a full length movie. I found 'Hugo' on balance to simply be too long, and very boring.This was yet another film that demonstrates that visuals alone, no matter how compelling, cannot substitute for a decent story.",4,7,14,8 December 2011
Aliens," Timeless Movie....'Aliens' has it all....
","I have seen a lot of films in my day, and I can say without hesitation that I consider this is the best action film ever made...'Aliens' has it all, suspense, horror, solid acting, cool hardware, breathtaking effects....you name it. The quality of this film is most evident in how well it has aged. If watched today, it does not feel like a 30+ year old movie. In fact, I think it comes off BETTER than most modern releases because it is not infused with the CGI cancer that has become the staple of modern film making, but generally comes off lifeless and uninteresting, like watching a bad cartoon.I won't go into a detailed review of the film, because I imagine everyone who enjoys this sort of genre has already seen it, probably many times.The first time I saw this film in a theater, it had me on the edge of my seat like no other movie has before or since. It is that good...Bill Paxton's character 'Hudson' was a classic, with lines that I continue quoting to this day:'Game over MAN! Game over!'If by any chance anyone reads this who has not seen this film, by all means do so. Unfortunately 'Aliens' is a film, far more than most, that really NEEDS the immersion of being seen on the big screen. While still good at home, something is definitely lost viewing it that way.I pray this is a film that Hollywood, greedy for money and with few original ideas, never tries to remake. Any attempt to remake this movie today would result in another CGI atrocity that would suck.Enough praise. Simply a great film.",10,1,3,26 June 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Ignore the positive reviews....this movie sucks....hard
","I will keep this brief....No significant story to speak of...the film just drones on and on with the 'gotta catch the creatures that escaped from the suitcase' crap. That is basically it.Poor/inadequate character development. There are just 'characters' in the movie....we know little to nothing about them or their motivations....and care little to nothing about what happens to any of them.The essence of the film is 'look at the weird and charming CGI creatures we created'. I cannot believe that after all the years of CGI...the producers of this movie still believed that effects alone can make a movie....but apparently they do. The CGI is not new or refreshing in any way that I could see...just CGI.I am sure this movie will get some audience in the first few days, just by tapping into the 'Harry Potter' world. But it won't last. Word will get out, and the (currently ridiculously inflated) IMDb ratings will drop like a stone.Take my word on this. This is a boring and bland failure of a movie. I slept through about a third of it, and those moments of unconsciousness were the best part.",3,101,194,19 November 2016
Bridesmaids," Simply hilarious....see it!
","This movie succeeds in virtually every scene. I was laughing so hard I was tired at the end.It uses the standard crude/juvenile humor formula (which I happen to love) popular in 'guy' movies, and adapts it to the romantic comedy genre usually more popular with women. It works brilliantly. This is a very funny movie. The scene with the food poisoning in the bridal shop had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe.While effectively incorporating crude humor, the film is also a touching look at how relationships evolve as we grow and mature. The friendship between the two main characters was very believable, and I am sure most people will identify with the feelings and conflicts experienced by the two.I don't want to review Bridesmaids in great detail, just to give it two thumbs up and recommend you see it. It is brilliant!",9,2,6,7 June 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Entertaining...but definitely beginning to trade substance for spectacle...
","I will say upfront that I enjoyed this film. As a definite fan of the LOTR series, it was nice to see many of the characters again in a different adventure. The continuity they achieved in the appearance of the characters was surprising...particularly considering twelve years had elapsed between the productions. That is a long time, and it was fortunate that none of the essential characters had gained weight or changed in other ways that would have destroyed the illusion of continuity, particularly considering that 'The Hobbit' was supposed to have taken place 60 years before the first installment of the LOTR trilogy.This is the basis of my concern about 'The Hobbit' and the direction the trilogy appears to be taking. The Hobbit trilogy is based on one Tolkien book, that in its entirety is considerably shorter and a more simple story than the shortest of the three books of the LOTR trilogy. I fear this was nothing more than a blatant attempt to wring the most profit possible from The Hobbit franchise. No matter how poor The Hobbit trilogy may or may not turn out to be, it is virtually guaranteed to be a money maker simply by riding the coat tails of the popularity of LOTR.While I enjoyed The Hobbit, it did confirm many of the suspicions I explained above. What made the LOTR trilogy such a great series was primarily complex and compelling story, and sympathetic character development. Yes, the spectacular visuals were compelling as well, but they complemented the story without dominating it. Contrary to many viewers, I felt 'Fellowship of the Ring' was the best of the LOTR series. The other two films, while strong in their own right, gradually began to trade story and character for eye popping visuals.The Hobbit takes this trend further still. Some story elements were added that never appeared in the book, which I'm sure was practically essential to pull a film trilogy out of such a short and simple novel. But The Hobbit was also right on the bubble of being a film that was spectacle and little more. Film makers the world over still have apparently failed to learn that spectacular CGI will not carry an audience's interest in a 2+ hours movie. The Hobbit was very close to falling into that trap....but not quite there.So in summary, I enjoyed The Hobbit but potential viewers (particularly fans of LOTR) should be aware it is a film that is long on spectacle and short on substance when compared to the prior trilogy. And I for one am more than a bit concerned that the next two Hobbit films might slip further down that slope and become little more than bloated CGI extravaganzas....Time will tell I guess.",7,10,20,4 January 2013
Get Out," Shockingly Racist and Socially Irresponsible....
","This movie was absolutely, blatantly, unapologetically racist.I know it is still considered 'OK' in chic society to stereotype and demean white people based on nothing but their race, but this movie takes it to the next level and beyond. I am in a mild state of shock after having seen it.I will admit the movie was very creepy....and I thought the acting and casting was above average...but the film was so socially irresponsible I am not sure what else to say about it. If you are someone who believes that 100% of white people are racist en-slavers and exploiters of black people....you will love every minute.Or if you believe the best way to correct perceived racism ....past or present....is with toxic, over the top racism....you too will love this film.Or if you are one who puts up their finger to see which way the winds of fashion are blowing before you form an opinion on critical social issues, this movie is right up your alley as well....",3,20,45,26 March 2017
Drive," Fresh take on the 'Action Movie' formula
","I enjoyed this film....From the previews, it appeared to follow the standard action movie formula wherein the protagonist was impossibly tough, impossibly cool, and impossible to swallow. In one sense, 'Drive' does follow this formula. In a broader sense however, 'Drive' was one of the most original movies I have seen in a long time.I think what made this film different were largely the characters. They had believable dialog, believable motives, and most importantly believable relationships with one another. Unlike most action movies, 'Drive' did not try to carry itself on mayhem and special effects. Make no mistake, this is a violent film. But action and violence were simply part of the story, rather than being THE story. The film starts out almost as a 'slice of life' that examines the lives and relationships between the central characters, with little story apparent in the first third of the movie. But gradually the story comes together, and everything for the characters falls apart, in a relatively petty bid for money and self interest. The way everything occurred almost reminded me of one of the 'real life' crime shows one sees on TV. The plot in 'Drive' is truly more believable than it is glamorous.I thought Ryan Gosling's portrayal of driver at times took the moody silence thing a bit too far. There were times in the film where I wished I could shake him and scream 'Speak!' But I gradually began to like the character he portrayed. I suppose he was a bit too confident, a bit too competent, and a bit too much of a 'bad-ass' to really be believable. But this enhanced the movie rather than detracted from it. I guess that part is where the 'suspension of disbelief' comes into it.There has been a depressing lack of originality in the movie scene for some time now. I believe they are doing a re-make of 'Spiderman' to go along with the remakes of 'Batman' and 'Superman'.......'Drive' is not only an enjoyable film, it deserves extra credit because it is original, it is something different from the standard movie fare.I recommend moviegoers who are not put off by extreme violence go see this film. Fans of Quentin Tarentino in particular will enjoy 'Drive'.",8,2,5,20 September 2011
2012," This is really a bad, bad movie......
","How many times would you think one movie could use the 'airplane just barely taking off as disaster approaches' sub-plot? Well, more than you think apparently....This movie was so bad I found myself mildly irritated throughout most of it. It is essentially a remake of the 1970s disaster movies. Imagine 'Poseidon Adventure', 'Earthquake', 'Towering Inferno' and 'Airport' all shamelessly crammed into one movie. Trouble is, while none of the 70s disaster epics were very good, this movie is much worse.'2012' is one of those films that tries to float itself on nothing but endless and ridiculous CGI effects. Some of them are dramatic, for a minute or so. But this is nearly a three hour movie.... The acting is hokey and overblown, and you will find you care nothing for any of the main characters. Heck, by the time you are very far into this movie you really don't even care much what happens to planet earth itself....Please, PLEASE save your money and time. Skip this one.....",2,22,36,23 November 2009
Stardust," This Movie is NOT worth seeing....
","'Stardust' was simply worse than mediocre. It was boring, convoluted, had ZERO character development, and partly because of these flaws, it was also overly long.It is one of those movies where nothing that happens is very interesting, because the viewer is not remotely invested in the characters and will not care in the least what happens to any of them. The story attempts to be different and imaginative, but ends up simply ridiculous and silly.I will not waste more time on this review. Please just do yourself a favor and do not see this film.",2,8,48,27 August 2007
Avatar," Spectacular and Groundbreaking Visuals....Tired Hypocritical Story
","This film has clearly raised the bar with regard to computer generated special effects. I had previously never been a fan of the CGI technology. While it has allowed film possibilities that could not have occurred without it, the CGI scenes have always left me with the feeling that I was watching a cartoon....'Avatar' has showed us that there is no longer anything, effects wise, that cannot be put into a film. Further, this movie does it in breathtakingly seamless fashion. The planet Pandora and its creatures are simply gorgeous and relatively believable. The action scenes are breathtaking.Now to the story. This is simply another tired remake of the 'Western civilization (primarily the USA) raping mother earth and exploiting noble indigenous peoples' theme. I am so tired of this simplistic and hypocritical leftist style of film, that were it not for the awe inspiring visuals in the movie, I would have only given it two or three stars out of ten.There is nothing whatsoever original about this plot. Combine 'Dances with Wolves' and 'Ferngully', and you have the story for 'Avatar'.Nothing more needs to be said. If you buy into this simplistic sort of preaching, you will love the movie without hesitation. If you, like me, are tired of it, I can still recommend the film as a spectacular visual experience.",7,1,2,1 January 2010
Super 8," This movie largely fails....and is unoriginal to boot
","Honestly, this film was a mess.It tries very hard to be mysterious and suspenseful, but fails. I would summarize it as a 'slice of life' portrayal of the kids in the movie. They go through their lives, acting and thinking like the adolescents that they are. In the background we know something (something largely predictable) is going on related to the train wreck and the presence of the military. The problem is that during the long, agonizing middle of the film, this 'situation' has virtually nothing to do with the kids and is largely ignored. The movie drags horribly during the middle (2/3 of the film) because quite simply nothing is happening.The character development is pretty good, and for that reason I at least gave the movie a mediocre rating. But, in terms of the story, it falls flat on its face.Having said all that, it was the complete lack of originality that really bothered me here. It seems Spielberg has dipped too many times into the same well. If I described this movie as a compilation of ET, Goonies, and Close Encounters, you would have a very good idea what to expect. Yet, where all those other movies succeeded (at least on some level), Super 8 fails. It was boring, predictable, and felt cobbled together.I recommend you skip this one, or perhaps watch it in TV.",5,1,2,21 June 2011
In Time," Marxist Garbage...and bad story to boot!
","This is another film trying to force-feed Marxist propaganda down our throats.I imagine the creators of this film believed that the 'clever' concept of time being using as currency relieved them of the need to concoct a decent story, or to at least be subtle about the political message they were trying to convey. They failed, and this movie is about as subtle as a train wreck. A child could see that by substituting the film's concept of time with money, this film was just a vehicle for the producer's message about money, capitalism, and the 'unequal distribution of wealth'. 'If all the time (cough, MONEY) was just divided equally, eeeeverything would be paradise'......oh, please.Even if you don't care about, or agree with the film's political message, it is simply a bad movie. The story is childlike, the acting wooden and unconvincing, and the sets/wardrobe are basically a 'Matrix' rip-off.Terrible movie, with an offensive political message to boot (at least offensive to me). Skip it!",1,9,29,1 November 2011
The Departed," Bloated....overly long....but decent
","I do not understand some of the raves about this movie. It was simply an average to slightly above average 90 minute thriller stretched into 140 (or thereabouts) minutes.The premise was sort of astonishingly unbelievable. Nicholson's character is a street wise gangster....who for reasons not really clear takes on a crew member who had just completed (or nearly completed) the State Police academy. 'I am not a cop...honest' seems to be all he needs to say in order to go DEEP undercover in the Boston underworld. Right. There is no 'trial period'.....immediately this ex-cop turned gangster is made privy to the gang's most critical secrets, including murders and assorted other felonies. THEN, when it soon becomes apparent that there is an informer in their midst, they are unable to focus in on the obvious suspect. In addition, despite having irrefutable evidence of crimes that would put Nicholson's character UNDER the jail for 300 years, that is not enough for them to move forward with arrests and prosecutions...???? The movie also seriously drags in many places, like the ridiculous relationship with the police psychiatrist. The ending is completely unimaginative, and actually was sort of a surprise because it was so predictable. I was expecting at least some sort of a plot twist to be revealed. Wrong.This movie might be worth watching on DVD if you have no other good choices, but don't waste your money at the theater.",5,5,14,10 October 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Who is actually rating this movie highly?
","When I read all the positive reviews of 'Sherlock Holmes' here on IMDb, I actually genuinely question the validity and sincerity of the reviews posted here. I envision a grand plot, wherein the producers of this film know it is a bomb, so they send the word out for all the family, friends, and associates of those with a vested interest in the movie's success to come to IMDb and post disingenuous positive reviews..... An elaborate attempt to salvage some financial success from a movie that is an absolute stinker.It worked on me. I went because the film had an average 8 out of 10 rating here on IMDb. Something is wrong there folks. There is no way those reviews can be genuine.If you have not yet wasted your time and money to see this film, please trust me, it is TERRIBLE. The plot is convoluted and boring, the characters ridiculous, and everything that happens in it is contrived and silly. The only reason I gave it 2 rather than 1 out of 10, is because I found some of the sets of late 19th century England to be mildly interesting.I went to the movie with a group of six people, the youngest being 15. The movie was universally hated in my group. I actually heard someone snoring in the theater during the film. The silliness in this film reminded of bombs such as 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', 'Wild, Wild West' and movies of that nature.I realize people have different tastes, but I do not understand how anyone could honestly give this movie a positive review. I hope posting my opinion will save you from wasting the time and money to see it. It is too late for me.",2,11,23,4 January 2010
Arrival," This movie was so bad that.....
",People leaving the prior showing were WARNING us as we went in. I heard 'very slow'....'boring'....and 'unintelligible' from various viewers.That has never happened to me before....ever....in 45 or so years of movie viewing.And that pretty much sums it up. 'Arrival' was boring and nonsensical.The people giving it praise must be vastly more intelligent than I am...or something....Maybe I just did not understand it.Maybe....but I sure did not like it and I don't think most prospective viewers will either.Skip it.,2,4,9,24 November 2016
X-Men: First Class," Silly, cheesy, contrived, bomb.
","Once again, I was prompted into seeing this movie because of extremely high IMDb reviews.I could not disagree more with those who are rating this movie highly. Frankly, I thought it was terrible.Where to begin....I understand a movie dealing with a subject like X-Men requires a large suspension of disbelief. I was actually a fan of the first X-Men movie, but this latest incarnation was bad in so many ways I am not sure I am a sufficiently proficient writer to articulate them....It was cheesy, silly, contrived, largely poorly acted, and simply ridiculous. The plot and antagonist reminded of the worst of the 'James Bond' franchise, with the villain traveling around in a luxurious submarine with an attractive woman (who could turn herself into a diamond....riiiiight) hanging on his arm. He is going to destroy the world, of course, and smile and laugh while doing it so we will know he is really bad. Lame.Despite spending a lot of time examining the history of the major characters, the film has almost zero effective character development. There is a 'Tinkerbell' like character who flies around on dragonfly wings and spits fireballs. She of course is knock-out gorgeous, and is discovered while working as a stripper. Yes, I am capable of 'suspending disbelief', but there was no point here. This was simply painfully stupid.I know nothing of the X-Men comics, but I think the idea is mildly interesting as long as it is kept within limits. They managed to do this with the first movie. However, since the first installment they have become less and less focused on story and character development, and more and more based on ridiculous spectacle.In the larger picture, I am simply going to have to stop paying attention to the 'Best' ratings that show up first on IMDb when a new film is released. I have wasted too much money seeing highly rated films, like this one, that are simply terrible. I am convinced these reviews are not genuine and are quickly posted when poor films are released in an attempt to salvage some commercial success.I sincerely hope this review will save some of you from making my mistake. This latest X-Men film is awful. Hopefully this review will be visible among the dishonest hype, and save some of you from wasting your time and money.",2,101,189,13 June 2011
Thor: The Dark World," My god this is a terrible movie....
","I am not sure where to begin....Maybe I was a bit lost because I never saw the first 'Thor'...and I am not familiar with the character and what he is all about...But regardless...this movie was rambling and disjointed. All the characters were so superficial and one dimensional that I did not care in the least what happened to any of them. Apparently the entire universe was at risk, and this film managed to make that prospect completely boring and leave the viewer 100% indifferent about the outcome. Impressive.There were a few attempts at humor thrown into the movie. They were all childish...they failed...and in fact were so 'unfunny' they made me cringe.About Thor. How interesting is a character who is apparently entirely omnipotent....? Near as I can tell, he can neither be hurt nor killed....and can travel the universe at more than the speed of light. Yawn. I have enjoyed Natalie Portman in many films...but even she could not contribute anything useful to this turd.Having said all this...as of this writing this movie has a 7.6 IMDb rating. I don't get it... I felt I had to post an honest review to counter that nonsense.",1,123,209,28 November 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla doesn't work....on any level.
","I just saw this movie with a friend. I wasn't expecting too much, since I rarely like CGI-extravaganza type films. Even having said that, I left this movie disappointed and angry. It was really bad, and if I was alone I would have walked out long before it was over.I do not understand the art of cinema sufficiently to explain exactly why the movie was so bad. If I was tasked to make a 'spectacle' film about two large monsters fighting, I don't think I could do any better. But then again I am not in the business...To summarize, the film was a disjointed mess. Characters are introduced, then fade in and out of the action without any development or real purpose. I could point out dozens of plot holes and logic flaws in the way the film progressed, but that would be giving the movie too much credit. It would imply that if some disbelief was suspended the movie would have been 'OK', and it wouldn't. Even the CGI was hokey in many places. The Godzilla creature was shaped and proportioned exactly like a man in a Godzilla suit. This fact was actually sort of humorous. Back when these movies were first made, when Godzilla WAS a man in a suit, I can see that as a necessary concession to budget and production. But since I know the 2014 Godzilla was 100% CGI, why not abandon that compromise? To put it bluntly, I thought even for those few moments that Godzilla appeared, he looked silly.The movie is completely without any suspense, and it is plainly obvious early on how it is going to end...not conclude...just end...stop.Enough said I guess. Ignore the 7+ IMDb rating (how?) and skip this one. An honest rating would be 2 or 3. I don't believe it merits a '1'...just because I think it is a difficult story to make a decent film out of. Maybe they simply should have skipped re-making 'Godzilla' altogether and instead come up with something original? Another 'Spiderman' remake perhaps?",2,6,13,23 May 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," Slightly entertaining (very slightly), but ridiculous and silly....
","I went to this movie with a friend who likes mindless action movies, so I wasn't expecting much more than that.'John Wick 2' was even more silly than I expected, however.First of all, John Wick is essentially invulnerable. Bullets do not harm him, nor do endless blows and stabs to every part of his body. He is sort of like you combined Bruce Lee with Superman....except with guns....and endless choreographed fight scenes that feel more like dancing than fighting. I guess it is OK that Wick is invulnerable, but it makes kind of a boring movie. You know that no matter what odds are stacked against him, he will still come out on top. And he does. Yawn.And the odds are stacked. My buddy and I estimated that Wick killed between 50 and 100 people in the movie. It may have even been higher than that.Also the 'secret guild of assassins' premise is beyond ridiculous. Apparently, every person on the street in New York City is a clandestine, bad-ass assassin.... Who knew? Don't they run out of people to assassinate?I am capable of 'suspending disbelief'....but the more I dissect this film, I cannot escape the fact that it was just stupid and silly.Yeah...I'm pondering it all now. 'John Wick 2' sucked. No nice way to put it.But hey, my buddy liked it. I guess people like him must account for some of the positive reviews.",3,42,88,24 February 2017
Annihilation," Dark but highly thought provoking...poses questions more than answers.
","I wouldn't call 'Annihilation' light entertainment, something you would want to see on a first date or anything...But I greatly enjoyed it. It is nice to see a film with some original elements for a change, and one that kind of makes you think....whether you want to or not. This film sets a dark mood very early on, and does a good job throughout enhancing that mood and keeping the viewer on a disturbed 'edge'.The characters were believable and sympathetic, and it was fascinating watching them encounter the bizarre happenings in the movie, simply because they were indeed believable and easy to empathize with.I cannot say I was 100% satisfied with the ending....but it forced me to ponder what sort of ending would have been better for a film of this sort. I couldn't come up with one...*****Spoiler***** The bear-ish 'creature' that appears partway through the film, was without a doubt one of the creepiest, most disturbing presences I have seen in any film....EVER.Bottom line, I recommend 'Annihilation'....go see it....but do not expect standard Hollywood fare. This movie is different.",8,11,27,25 February 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Absolutely Incredible Spectacle.....
","I have seen this film twice, and remain completely blown away by the entire spectacle.Normally I am not at all a fan of movies with little story that try to engage the viewer with awesome visuals and action. Clearly Mad Max: Fury Road is precisely in that category.However, I have to give credit where credit is due...they made it work.I almost wish this was a completely standalone film that did not attempt to tie into the 'Mad Max' franchise, because it has little in common with the releases from years past, and for me Mel Gibson will always be the only 'Mad Max'. All this latest film shares with the Gibson releases is the name and a few of the general visuals.So on to the action....since that is all this movie really is.I am certain at least some of the scenes in this film had to be CGI, simply because there would be no other way to do them. Despite this, it is seamless. I can normally spot CGI a mile away, and in Fury Road I honestly could not tell which effects were done with actual 'hardware' and which were computer generated. This is important because it is key to the amazing visual experience of watching this.The action scenes were breathtaking...I'm not sure how else to describe them. They were accompanied by audio that on occasion gave me goose bumps, particularly the air horns on the main 'war rig' and the surrealistic 'music' from the mutant rock and roller on the pursuing rig.I realize this movie will not be for everyone, but nonetheless I have to say it raises the bar for what can be put on the screen in the action film genre. I am already trying to come up with an excuse to see it a third time.Highly recommended.",9,1,11,3 June 2015
Contact," One of my favorite movies of all time.....
","I remember seeing this movie in the mid-90s in the theater. It moved me in ways that few movies have, and in ways that are very difficult to put into words... I think it is the best science fiction movie I have ever seen, with 'Blade Runner' a close second.This film so intelligently illuminates so many facets of the human condition on this planet. In one sense anyone watching this movie could become very cynical about the hypocrisy, corruption, self indulgent and self destructive nature of humanity. But while conveying this, the film also highlights what is great and special about the human race, and in subtle ways gives the viewer a deep seated sense of hope for the future. It also reminds us, that in the scope of the vastness of the universe, in the 'big picture' our petty struggles here on planet earth really matter very little at all.The film also contains one of the most intelligent and unbiased looks at subjects of religious faith and spirituality, with far more depth and insight than I can recall experiencing in any other movie.Beyond all this, 'Contact' is also a grand tale of adventure, of the first journey into a completely unknown frontier.The acting is largely flawless, and the special effects were certainly adequate not to detract in any way from the magic of the film, even though by 2011 standards they might look a bit dated.I know not all are as moved by this film as I was. Soon after it came out, I was raving about it to my brother. His response was 'meh, it was OK I guess. I thought it was pretty cool when the machine blew up....' I am probably not doing a very good job of expressing why I so loved this film. All I can say is that if you have not seen it, DO SO!",10,1,3,24 February 2011
V for Vendetta," One of my All Time Favorites
","I went into this movie not expecting much. The previews looked rather hokey on first glance, sort of like a 'B' movie take on a silly comic book character.Watching this movie however, I was fascinated from the beginning.I believe Hugo Weaving deserved an Oscar for his performance as 'V'. To create such a deep, fascinating, and sympathetic character without ever showing his face has to rank among the greatest acting achievements ever put on film.The dialog in the film was fantastic, almost poetic at times, again due in large part to Weaving's performance. I understand much of it was taken virtually word for word from the graphic novel, which is now on my 'must read' list.I was also a fan of Stephen Rea's performance as Inspector Finch. His tired, professional dignity, working in support of a government he was very wary of, was perfect.But most of all, I loved the message of this movie. It is in the nature of all governments to gradually limit freedom, even governments with relatively benevolent beginnings. This occurs incrementally, and with noble sounding intentions. V for Vendetta can serve as a wake-up call for how far this trend can go if not arrested.See this movie. You will not be sorry.",9,3,10,19 September 2010
