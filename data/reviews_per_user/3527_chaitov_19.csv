Captain Phillips," You Must See this Movie
","I've been on a roll these past few months,seeing four fantastic movies, Blue Jasmine,Prisoners,Gravity & now this wonderful film based on a true story about Captain Phillips whose cargo ship was swarmed by Somali pirates. The action leading up to this moment is fast paced,interesting, & mesmerizing.I was never bored for a second even though the movie was over two hours.This movie was totally riveting,from start to finish.Tom Hanks was superb. I was so proud & impressed with the US Navy & the Navy Seals in the way they handled this horrendous situation. It's one of those movies you rarely see where there is no overacting,the casting is realistic and you feel as though you are watching a true-to- life reality show. If you see only a few more movies before the end of this year,make sure Captain Phillips is one of them.You will be thoroughly moved by every segment of this amazing film.",10,1,3,15 October 2013
Gravity," Complete Escapism for 90 Minutes
","If you want a total break from the daily worries & routines of your everyday life,I suggest you go see 'Gravity.' Along with the 3D experience I was utterly transported to outer space and completely absorbed in this amazing visual 'feast for the eyes',and every other sense. It's really a total 'happening.' Sandra Bullock was so believable.There was no overacting in this movie from any actor.Kudos to the director,cinematographer,and music score.It is a mesmerizing movie that will stay with you forever.I will see this again and again and again. You will leave the theatre feeling a great sense of renewal and satisfaction. Don't miss this gem.",9,4,7,12 October 2013
The Hunger Games," Did Not Love it,Did Not Hate it
","I didn't read the book and therefore had no idea what the movie was about. After reading a few reviews,I decided to give the movie a chance. Firstly,I found it much too long. For the first hour and a half,I felt like I was watching American Idol,or America/Canada's Got Talent. I could just see Ryan Seacrest up there as MC before the games began. It was so predictable at that point,even boring. Also,the people in this dystopia looked very weird and not believable. When the games started,I was getting very dizzy with the shaky camera work. I imagine this was to give it a PG rating so as not to show too realistically any of the teens killing each other. It was just touched upon,not that I would want to see too much violence either. When the Hunger Games were in full swing,I really kept thinking of the reality TV show,'Survivor.' There were a few inane twists at the end but all in all,I never felt fully immersed in the movie.For the last hour,I kept looking at the time.This doesn't take away from the great performances by Jennifer Lawrence,Woody Harelsen,or Donald Sutherland. All in all,I wasn't moved by this movie. What were the reasons for the present state of affairs in the future North America.And show us some depth in the main characters. Forty years ago,in 1972,I saw a very intense movie about a future dystopia,'Soylent Green,' with Charleton Heston and Edward G. Robinson. I have never forgotten it. We saw people starving,begging for food,etc. There was deep emotion and you could identify with the characters. This was not the case for me watching The Hunger Games. By tomorrow,I will have forgotten most of the movie. Wait for it on DVD is my advice or go on a day when rates are reduced.",6,0,3,1 May 2012
Spider-Man 3," Toby McGuire is a big baby
","Watching Toby McGuire cry like a baby for two hours made me go limp. Why did Sandman apologize at the end for being such a bad guy and why did that big baby Toby not wear his mask for half the movie? This movie should have been called 'Tobyman the Big Baby 3'. It stunk up Hollywood so bad. I Think Stan Lee should denounce this movie and Sam Raimi should never make a movie again. I felt very cheated out of my escape from reality. Venom was so lame and weak, and Goblin sucked. I hope they don't make another movie. Or they should get another director and someone else to play spider-man and reinvent him like they did Batman with Christian Bale.Toby McGuire should not do Superhero movies. He's a Big Baby!",1,8,14,10 May 2007
Suicide Squad," I Cant See The Action on Screen,Too Dark.
","OK.So I'm a senior.But I've seen lots of Marvel/DC Comics movies. I really liked Ant Man last year because there was a story to it.Suicide Squad was filmed in my home town, Toronto.There was so much hype.But even my grown son hated it when we saw it.There's no character development. We wasted our money.Don't go to this disaster. You'll regret it no matter your age.During each scene, I was wondering what is happening.Because the lighting was so dark,I couldn't make out the action. There were times I kept asking myself why I had agreed to come to this film. The character,Harley Quinn, had this Brooklyn accent which didn't really fit in. The joker was a joke,not even scary or comical.This was the worst movie I have seen this year.",1,95,153,8 August 2016
Mamma Mia!," Extremely Overacted!!
","I went to see 'Mamma Mia'last night after keeping it on my list of must-see movies. Although the music/dancing scenes were great and very professional and polished the movie itself was a great disappointment to me. I love Meryl Streep. In all of her movies she is a wonderful actress going back to 'Sophie's Choice' and more recently 'The Devil Wears Prada',but I just couldn't connect with HER singing and dancing,whether it was really her voice or lip syncing,and even though she was very energetic and did a great acting job,it seemed so incongruous.And what about Pierce Bronsman? He just seemed ridiculous and could not sing for beans! I also felt there was so much overacting! I did see this movie on TV recently in a Swedish or other Scandanavian version and it was so natural.The performances were not overdone and you felt it flowed so spontaneously. This movie was so loud and so exaggerated that it lost it's effectiveness for me.I would rather have seen it on DVD, and not waste my money.There was no empathy at all with the main characters and no character development so it left me feeling empty even with great music for the most part.",5,1,3,23 August 2008
Non-Stop," Intense & Gratifying
","When Liam Neeson mentioned to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show that he's 63 years old,I couldn't believe it. Not only is he a wonderful actor,but such a gracious,intelligent and humble person. And he brings these qualities to all his movies. After seeing a terrible movie a few months ago, Bad Grandpa,I had all but given up on spending money on so much drivel out there. I really lucked out with Non Stop.As the other reviewers have stated,you're on the edge of your seat.In so many movies,I'm looking at my watch,etc.,but not in this masterpiece.I was totally immersed in this movie.Neeson is a true actor. He's so believable in this role as in his many others. You are definitely kept guessing & wondering who is the culprit.(s) It's not too long & to me had a satisfying ending as all the bad guys 'got it.' So,if you want a terrific movie with great casting,(shocked to realize that Lady Grantham (Downton Abbey) played by Michelle Dockery is one of the stewardesses),run,don't walk to see this great film.Given what's happening in the world today with the lost plane,this movie has all the more relevance regarding how vulnerable we all are when flying.",9,2,4,16 March 2014
Gone Girl," So Disappointed
","The ratings were so high for this movie.I was sure it would be a great film. What rubbish it was. For the first hour I kept looking at my watch,it was so slow moving. Ben Affleck was average in his performance. The acting of Rosamund Pike was way over the top,even though she played a psychopath. There was so much sex,oral sex,suggestive sex in this film for pure shock value or maybe to make a boring movie more interesting. But nothing could help this moronic film.At the beginning I couldn't even hear the dialogue between them.It was so garbled.The plot was silly in my opinion. There are more fascinating plots in real life. And the men portrayed in this film are spineless weaklings while the women are tough and crazy.For example,the crime stories of killers Jodi Arias,Casey Anthony,and all the other crime plots on 48 hours or Dateline are mysteries which are fascinating,as well as being true.Thankfully,I had a gift card to this mess of a film,so paid very little. Why it is considered the best new movie out this week doesn't say much for the calibre of movies made today. Do not waste your money on this very bad crime mystery.Better to watch 20/20,or 48 hours at home. I like David Fincher as a director but nevertheless was extremely disappointed.The lesson here is don't believe the critics, audience and/or ratings all the time. Do some research.This film is a waste of your time and money.",2,95,181,14 October 2014
Jurassic World," Forgettable
","Although the visuals in this movie are wonderful along with the realistic looking dinosaurs,it is still a forgettable movie when you leave the theatre.The plot is so mundane and boring. The protagonists could be fighting aliens,their military enemies or even King Kong. It is all the same. I kept looking at my watch to see how much longer this movie was.Segments of the film are enjoyable,the music for the most part is moving,but the plot has much to be desired.The acting in parts is very weak aside from the younger boy whom I thought is a realistic young actor.The script was silly especially when one of the theme park tech workers is about to kiss his colleague and she says 'No,I have a boyfriend.' Everyone in the theatre laughed.It was very corny along with much of the script. But the 3D dinosaurs are awesome and fun to watch. I would wait for this film to be on DVD,rather then spend money to watch it.",6,6,15,13 June 2015
Prisoners," Two Days Later,still thinking about Prisoners.
","It is rare that a Hollywood movie would provoke so much thought,analysis,& discussion as 'Prisoners' did for me.I was hooked from the beginning.Fantastic performances were given by Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal.The Direction by Denis Villeneuve was amazing.As in Incendies, his 2012 nomination for best foreign movie,there is an unexpected twist. With no special effects,no sex,moderate violence to make a point,the movie still hits a cord with the audience. I will definitely see it again as there is sure to be new revelations the second & third time. If you only see a few movies before the new year,make 'Prisoners' your first choice. In some way,we are all prisoners of our environment & of our own thoughts & actions.",9,2,4,2 October 2013
The Dark Knight," SO Disappointed!!!!
","OK, I know I am not that well versed on all the action comics from which these movies are made, but this Batman was one of the worst films I have ever seen that is based on an action figure.True, the acting from some of the main characters was very good,the Joker by Heath Ledger and Batman by Christine Bale,(although his Batman voice gave me the creeps) but,having seen the movie four hours ago all I now remember is Car Chases, Explosions, A hospital Being Blown Up,(the noise was so LOUD I had to hold my ears)and such intolerable camera work that I became totally dizzy and had to look away. It took me a long time to know who was who..maybe I am slow to understand, but the plot was so incomprehensible to me jumping from scene to scene that I kept looking at my watch.Where was the real fun that I remember? Even that old Batman Series on TV in the 80's was so entertaining.. Robin,the Penguin,Catwoman..and the plot was so SIMPLE..no Digital enhancements...just good scary fun for the kids!! Remember the on-screen 'BAM'..'ZOOM'..'KERPLUNK'..etc?? It was FUN..FUN!!for adults as well as kids. How could kids feel comfortable watching this..a gun held to the head of a little boy!..so much darkness..and things Blown Away!! How this could be rated #1 in theaters is all about HYPE..the death,sadly of Heath Ledger, who I thought was an unforgettable Joker but a little scary for kids! I kept asking my son 'Who are the good guys and who are the bad ones?' It really left me empty! The script was boring..the dialogue empty and the acting predictable. I loved 'The Fantastic Four','Spiderman',and 'The X-Men.' They had clever scripts and good character development. In 'The Dark Knight' ..there was none of this!Please..to parents out there, don't WASTE your money and don't SCARE your kids...this movie is boring, loud, and an utter disappointment..I do not care how much Money it has made so far!! Wait for it on DVD or do yourself a favour and PASS on this mixed up melange of drivel!!!",1,23,58,26 July 2008
Avatar," Stunning amazing visuals.
","I saw 'Avatar' today with my grown son. Even assuming that the story lines here are not new..anti-war,destruction of earth's natural resources,our treatment of natives,lack of empathy for other races and cultures, still it didn't matter at all. I was mesmerized, amazed and left breathless by the 3-D effects and the gorgeous lush visuals. I also was not bored for a second even though we were in the theatre for a full three hours including previews.The theatre was packed in the afternoon mostly with students and young adults. Everyone clapped at the end which you don't see too often today,given the typical drivel that is shown.I think James Cameron has outdone himself. Any movie that causes goosebumps and breathlessness is certainly worth seeing in my opinion.You won't be disappointed. Even though it was a bit pricey for a movie it was a wonderful movie experience.",9,2,6,23 December 2009
La La Land," So Disappointed!
","I was greatly looking forward to this movie.I had read many reviews and  they all seemed very positive.In fact when I read my newspaper's  critique is was given 4/4 which is unusual. How let down I am. This was  the worst movie I have seen this year.And we saw it in a VIP theatre.It  was so slow moving that I felt myself falling asleep. I kept looking at  my watch saying 'only another 1/2 hour.' Ryan Gosling cannot really  sing & dance.And Emma Stone may be very photogenic & a good actress but  she also is not much of a singer/dancer.There are wonderful musicals  such as The amazing 'West Side Story',the wonderful 'Grease' Chicago  was terrific to watch also as well as 'Hairspray' with Jennifer Hudson  & 'Mama Mia' with Meryl Streep.But this mess was a dud. The plot was  simple but its execution was a dismal failure.I cannot figure out all  the accolades this movie is getting from the Golden Globes,critics,&  user reviews. A few hours after this film,I cant really remember  anything worthwhile.Do not waste your money on this film whatever the  critics say.It is boring,non believable,& you wont really care about  the characters.",1,553,1108,26 December 2016
Woman in Gold," Could Have Been a Great Movie
","I didn't know what to expect when going to see 'Woman In Gold' yesterday.But I totally agree with many of the reviewers who felt the movie lacked emotion. I just couldn't connect with the characters even though Helen Mirren's portrayal of Maria Altmann was perfect down to her crisp Austrian accent.Opposite her was Ryan Reynolds as Maria's lawyer.He played it as the straight,young lawyer who also had family killed in the Holocaust. Even though I can't put my finger on the why of his lacklustre portrayal he seemed to try too hard in this role. He didn't seem natural at all. I much preferred the Austrian investigative reporter.He seemed much more genuine. This story is true and I felt that with the right screenwriter and some casting changes it would have been a movie as wonderful as 'Philomena' which is also based on a true story but much more believably done.I loved The story of Philomena and it touched me emotionally while 'Woman in Gold' has left me cold and detached.Watch this film on DVD rather than spend your money at the theatre.",5,3,7,13 April 2015
Titanic," See Titanic 3 D for Pure Entertainment
","I had seen Titanic 15 years ago and thought it was great then,although there were a few details that bothered me.Today,I was mesmerized,maybe because I am years older and saw it in a different light.I am still thinking about this movie four hours later.The over three hour running time went by in an instant.The 3D effects were fantastic. I felt I was on the ship,in the dining room & struggling to get into the lifeboat.There was not a second I was bored.Kate Winslet & Leonardo DiCaprio were better than I remembered,not over-acting but giving very natural performances.Kudos to James Cameron for giving us this amazing,entertaining &stunning film. No one left the theatre dry-eyed.If you see only one movie this year,make sure it's Titanic 3D.That this tragedy happened 100 years ago this month makes it all the more relevant.",10,2,4,4 April 2012
The Shape of Water," A Total Disaster
","I was so bored and never really knew what this so called artsy film was about or trying to tell me.To say it was weird is being kind.Was it a cross between The Creature from the Black Lagoon & The Thing,we'll never know. Why are they bringing her masturbating into the film? Is it for shock value? And having sex with the creature was actually funny To contrast, I loved The Darkest Hour for it's amazing performance by Gary Oldem,its wonderful sets,its riveting performances.t although Sally Hawkins is a great actor,why she would consent to act in this drivel is beyond understanding. And for sure there will be people who love this fiasco.It already won 2 golden globes.It was a huge disappointment for me.Thankfully I saw it on Kodi at home so it didn't cost me anything but two hours of my time.",1,5,23,17 January 2018
WALL·E," Utterly Disappointing
","I am a middle aged women who went with my grown son to see Wall-E because I had heard it was a masterpiece. True,the animation was amazing as in other Pixar films. However..it has been a very long time since I have been so bored that I kept looking at my watch. Depressing,slow paced,little plot development ...I couldn't wait till it was over! The theater was filled with kids being a ' Two Toonie Tuesday' ($4.00) in Toronto..but you could not hear a sound from them, no laughing..giggling..yelling...just kids having FUN...like you would expect.NOTHING but silence! Where is the enjoyment in this movie?? Truthfully I felt the same way...why make a kids movie showing such depressing themes..it could easily have been 'Soylent Green' from 1973..which was an exciting,fast paced action filled adult movie with the theme being future food shortages..but to have this theme in a children's movie..was extremely disappointing. I cannot understand everyone giving it top stars..other than the great animation!! You will be disappointed & bored..especially your kids!!!! Don't waste your money..wait for it on DVD.",2,9,39,8 July 2008
Me Before You," Pleasantly Surprised
","I'm in a book club where this book was very well received.I didn't expect much from the movie but was totally engrossed Emilia Clarke was perfect in the role. She didn't over act and was terrific as the 26 year old somewhat klutzy caregiver of the quadriplegic young man.I was never bored for a moment.As only the Brits can do,it was totally realistic The screenplay, acting, music, cinematography, all contributed to a beautiful movie.It never descended into being too schmaltzy. I thought the casting was right on, & although it dealt with very serious issues, still I found myself laughing in many scenes, especially at Clarke's antics. Every character in this movie played their role to the tee, no under or over acting. For a lovely movie experience this summer,which deals with current issues, & will provoke discussion,do yourself a favour and go see 'Me Before You. You'll be glad you did.",8,4,6,7 June 2016
The Social Network," See This If You See Only One Movie This Year!
","I was so focused on this enjoyable movie that it took me forty five minutes to get back to reality. I have only been on Facebook for the last few years. My eleven 'friends',most of whom don't even bother to communicate,being seniors as myself, still love to put photos of their children & grandchildren on Facebook. The script is fantastic,not petty or uninteresting. It is very clever,and at times you may have to really concentrate to get all the banter,innuendos and scholarly conversation. Even if you are lacking in computer code and litigation knowledge,you will still be mesmerized by the events in this movie. Besides all this,there is much wittiness and humour in the movie along with an excellent musical score that heightens the suspense.I just couldn't wait to see how it would all play out. I thought Jesse Eisenberg was amazing as Mark Zukerberg, so believable. Also,I was so impressed with the performance of Justin Timberlake as the founder of Napster, Sean Parker. I never knew he was such a great actor. His awesome performance was amazingly credible.Even though the film may have been Hollywoodised somewhat,it is so realistic and true-to-life. There are no over-acted or 'dumbed-down' scenes. Facebook is a site in progress and being so popular today,the movie is all the more relevant. I am still thinking of the story,the characters,their portrayals,and the fantastic script. I don't see movies more than once,that often but I really can't wait to see this one again. How amazing that it is a true story and still evolving. If you only see one movie this year,this is the one to see.",10,3,8,2 October 2010
