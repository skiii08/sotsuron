The Rock," Pure action!
","What can you say about this movie? This is action at is best. Oldtimer Sean Conery as good as in his best Bond movies, OK maybe not that good but how cool can a 65 year old man be, i think you can say like this!My absolute favorite actor, not just because I do look at lot like him, Nicolas Cage is so cool and good looking as always. His great feelings for Beatles is a great reminder for us guys that we sometimes need to keep our 'small' habits for our self. I believe the most of us have something that we spend money on that our girlie's don't know about. It is this small things inside the great action that also makes the whole picture. Well this is a big action with some humor in it, all of the characters is there and the queries we are all asking is if a human body can whieperise, can it??",9,5,6,17 February 2006
Armageddon," please give me more of this!!!
","When I first saw this movie it was at my age 18! Me and my girlfriend at the time went to the cinema and I was not expecting anything more the a good :-) time. It took me five minutes to realize that this was more then just a great time. I loved Bruce Willis from before and just more after this. What can you say about a girl like Liv Tyler and how cool can a man be, I think the answer is Steve Buscimi.I am from Sweden so the acting from Peter Stormare just make the whole thing better. I do not think that I can present to you how I feel for this movie. I have seen it on week days on my own, at the cinema with my old girlie and on Sundays with a hung over. Every time at least a couple of tears have been dropping from my eyes. When? At several times in the movie, for example when the mother tells her little child that the man on the screen is not a salesman but his father and of course when they meet at the landing field. When Bruce is the coolest man in the world and putting Mr. Afleck in to the shuttle, oh my god it is almost dropping a tear when I write this. 10+ is all I can say, if you have not seen it please do and if you have seen it please see it again!",10,1,2,17 February 2006
