The Lobster," I'm here to warn you
","I fell asleep during this movie probably 20 times. It started out OK, if not a little weird and I don't mind that.Then it came to the scenes after the initial ones 30 minutes in wherein dull dialogues were exchanged in deadpan.I know the reviewers think they're smart for rating this movie highly out of a sense of moral obligation to shine a light on our society and it's hypocrisy/absurdity about relationships.What I don't understand is why it needed to be so thoroughly unpleasant, boring, anticlimactic & predictable.It simply wasn't a good movie. It aroused little deeper thought and evoked almost no emotion. You knew what was coming a mile away at all times.I would highly recommend to anyone that they avoid this thoroughly unoriginal and self-indulgent dumpster fire of a movie.",1,55,93,10 July 2016
