The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the hype. This film is bad!!
","I'm very disappointed to see that all of the clones out there have fallen prey to the Hollywood Hype machine.  This is a bad movie, plain and simple. How a horror movie that is made up of bad camera work, an underdeveloped story, and definitely not scary be ranked so high is beyond me.  I realize that this is supposed to be like a home movie, but nobody would want to see my own home movies, including myself, if they were as bouncy as this one. This movie started out fine as far as story development is concerned. The beginning is the only thing redeeming about this movie.  There was some narration that actually helped develop the story, but when that ended it killed any chance this movie had of being scary.  A bunch of random events without background knowledge is worthless.  Three people screaming at each other about being lost is not scary.  Noises outside of proper context is not frightening.  Poor camera work is not artistic.  This is a bad movie.",2,0,1,9 August 1999
