Blade Runner 2049," Very slow & confusing
","I don't understand what people like in this movie. It has some good things, but nothing much to deserve such big rating. Soundtracks & atmosphere are really good & it's well shot, however story is confusing & everything is all over the place. I still didn't understand what was the whole story of movie and it is extremely slow & prolonged. Very small amount of talking & a lot more observing moments. Every minor action is prolonged. Like you see man laying in the snow for a few minutes & etc... I didn't like the movie & it took more than 2:30 hours...",4,3,6,4 August 2019
Us," Not as good as it seemed from the start
","It started interesting, thought it was something about supernatural/paranormal stuff (which I like), however ended with totally different thing with government and etc...",5,0,0,16 September 2019
The Shape of Water," Ignore bad reviews
","Ignore bad reviews. This movie has nothing common to 'Beauty and the Beast'. People are stupid in general and lack intelligence to see the message this movie is trying to give us: You view other people that are different from yourself as 'monsters' if you don't try to understand them. However, if you try to understand people who are different from yourself, then you will see that we are basically all alike even though we look different. In short, this movie is about Xenophobia problem.",10,2,8,1 May 2019
