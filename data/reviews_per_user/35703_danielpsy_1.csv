Moneyball," Moneymovie
","The book was excellently written, suspenseful, and delightfully detailed. The movie script was almost nonexistent. The movie was minimalist: almost no script, often no sound, inexplicably dark lighting, little character development, no actual acting by the main characters, and almost no plot. I cannot understand how someone who has not read the book could stay with this film beyond the first third...or how someone who has read the book could forget the rich material it offered which the film ignores. This film spends money, 50 million, and possibly may make money, but its money-venture nature is almost the only way it connects with its source. The book was filled with characters and explored the inspirations and motivations of life; it illuminated an institution -- the film was devoid of characters and character development, explored nothing comprehensible or important, and illuminated nothing. It signified nothing and didn't even have sound or fury. What a missed opportunity.",2,4,12,10 February 2012
