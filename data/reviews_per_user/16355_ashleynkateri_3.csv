It," One of the Best Stephen King Adaptations
","I thought the movie was amazing.Bill Skarsgard did an amazing job of playing Pennywise in my opinion. I remember watching the 90's miniseries and wondering how kids got lured by Pennywise because he seemed sinister right off the bat. However, in this movie although Pennywise was undoubtedly creepy, in his scene with Georgie I thought he did a great job of seeming more friendly for a short time. Bill's version was sinister and felt really deranged. He didn't get as many lines in the movie as I would have hope for, but the scenes where he was taunting/fighting them I thought were really well done and pretty scary. Although, that being said, one thing I didn't care for about Pennywise was when he attacks them he does this bizarre shaking thing which can be seen in the previews. Maybe because he's the dancing clown? I'm not sure but it made me laugh in the theater. My friend was terrified though so maybe I'm just weird.This movie doesn't follow the book exactly, but I think in terms of film adaptations, it stays pretty close. The one thing about the movie that bothered me was the nearly complete lack of stories that Ben, Mike and Stan got. The book has tons of backstory on each of the losers so I thought it was strange that they're kind of just background characters. Ben is on screen more than the other two, but really has no backstory other than being the new kid and having a crush on Beverly. Those three aside, I thought the kids who had the most screen time did an amazing job. Richie was absolutely hilarious and pretty much what I had pictured when I was reading the book. I think Eddie, Bill and Beverly were also pretty much spot on. Overall, I think this movie is worth the watch. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hardly noticed that it was over 2 hours because the cast did such a great job. I'm really excited to see what they do with the next movie.",9,5,13,9 September 2017
Hereditary," Boring and Ridiculous
","I'll be the first to say I expected to love this movie but I absolutely hated it. I'm a huge horror movie fan and watched it with other horror fans and everyone agreed that this movie was BAD.
First off, this movie is a little over two hours-which I normally wouldn't mind, but I felt every single minute of that two hours. This movie felt like it dragged on for 5 hours.
One thing I will say, I thought Toni Collette played her role very well but even she couldn't carry this. The storyline is absurd and confusing, even for a horror movie. I've never been one to really be confused when a movie ends but me and my friends all were tryng to figure out what was going on after the credits rolled.
I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but the ending where they were kneeling was so stupid I couldn't believe they actually had that in the movie. If you're going to do gore, do it right. It just looked ridiculously fake.
Lastly, this movie is boring. Now I'm not opposed to slow horror movies-they're some of the best in my opinion but the build up has to be worth it. As I mentioned, the ending is ridiculous to the point of almost being funny so it definitely wasn't worth any of the boring parts.
Overall, this had great potential but failed to deliver.",1,4,8,10 November 2018
Us," A Dark, Intelligent Thriller
","I understand why some people gave this movie a low score, but I personally loved it. It's not a straightforward movie, and some parts are ambiguous-which was certainly done on purpose-so if you don't want to watch a movie where you really have to think about, this isn't for you. This movie is chock full of symbolism, mostly subtle, about marganilization and the people who are more or less forgotten or treated differently by society. This movie has gotten a lot of flack on here for having plot holes and a somewhat confusing ending, but if you read up on some of the symbolism Jordan Peele used, a lot of that starts to make more sense. Personally, the ending made sense to me though I didn't see it coming. I thought the gory scenes were well-done and not over the top like so many horror movies before it. Also, I know there was an outcry over how one of the characters speaks, but if you actually watch the movie it makes sense. Overall, I thorougly enjoyed this movie and it was kind of fun to discuss theories afterwards.",9,6,13,1 April 2019
