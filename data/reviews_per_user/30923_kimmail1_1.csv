United 93," Wonderful movie
","This was an excellent movie. It has all the drama of a great Hollywood best seller but has one numbing, chilling fact.. it accually happened. It ranks up there with the A&E TV movie 'Flight 93'. A movie my sister still can not bring herself to watch, for the simple fact that we know it was not dramatized by Hollywood.. this happened.. these poor people on that plane really did call their families to say goodbye. The man really did pray the Lord's Prayer with the 911 operator. I hope that these 2 wonderful movies did justice to the character of those brave souls that last their lives trying to protect us by taking the plane down. My thoughts and prayers are still with their families and am so glad that they are honored in these 2 great films.",10,0,2,28 August 2006
