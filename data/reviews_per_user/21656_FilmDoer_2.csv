Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I gave it a 6 because it at least gave me information on the SW characters in their younger days.
","I AM quite the Star Wars Fan, but this one gave me too much/too little:1. An older Leia in SW did a better job than the younger queen in Phantom. For more spunk, the queen needed Mathilda's Fire in the Professional.2.  Anyone who was a bad guy in the Phantom Menace did not show enough criminal/corruption/villain/anger element.3.  The kids who were with me at Phantom thought that Jar Jar Binks was too much of a cartoon dork.4.  I think that Lucas went overboard on the special effects.  C'mon now, less is more.5.  Jedi.  In SW, ESB and RJ, Dead Jedi simply disappeared.  In Phantom, Darth Maul was sliced in half and you could broil a steak faster than the fully in tact Qui-Gon Jinn, Jinn probably roasting at a higher temperature.6.  The pod race announcer brought too much normalcy to Phantom.  Their announcing gave me a redneck, stock car race feel.7.  Too much martial artist in Darth Maul.  In SW, ESB, and RJ,we saw swordfighting.  Try using the raw energy from Braveheart.Darth Maul brought in Street Fighter to Phantom. To me, it cheapened the movie.8.  Bring back more of the dramatic music from the London Symphony Orchestra.  We could've used the musical clue that Anakin was using the force during the pod race.Lucas, you'll do better next time.",6,0,1,17 July 1999
American Pie," I went to this movie because someone said it was funnier than TSA Mary.
","TSA Mary was funnier.  This was Porky's, Weird Science, the Graduate, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, all rolled into one. I guess it's been a week since this movie's been opened in Silicon Valley, and this movie was actually sold out at the showing I watched.  The laughs were very few for a packed house.  Comments from the person I was with? She told me that the movie was just 'alright for a matinee.'  Thank God I only paid for this movie at half the price.",5,0,0,17 July 1999
