Black Swan," Intoxicating and disturbing, bravo!
","I am just back from the movie theatre where I saw the UK advanced screening of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (it will be released nationwide on January 21st).The movie opens with the main character Nina who dances alone on a dark stage of what it seems to be a ballet company theatre and since this very first scene we, as audience, are captivated by her obsessive, and at the same time intoxicating movements.Parallels between Black Swan and The Wrestler are unavoidable, even if here the fragility of mind is the main issue Nina is facing while Rourke's Randy 'The Ram' Robinson fought the off age passion for the ring.Jealousy and fear to lose her life awaited lead role in the Swan Lake ballet are not the only reasons which make Nina's life so difficult. We also have pressures from a way too domineering mother (Barbara Hershley) and advices from a way too pushy choreographer (Vincent Cassel) who believes she can deliver the 'White Swan', but is too frigid to play the 'Black Swan'.Nina's obsession with perfection will take her to a horrific and complete identification with the role she is playing in the Swan Lake, which is in many cases disturbing.Aronofsky's talented style which introduces thriller and even horror elements in a so complicated drama, pulls the best out of his actors and as Rourke and Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler also here we have a bunch of talented actors who are showing magnificent performances: first of all Portman (she dances for real), but also Cassel, Hersley, Kunis and Wynona Ryder.A must see, highly recommended!",8,6,12,18 January 2011
