Requiem for a Dream," Shocking, Disturbing, most realistic Movie to date
","after watching this movie alone and having a vague idea that it was pretty shocking, i found myself throwing up in the toilet bowl shortly after it ended.Requiem for a Dream is perhaps the only movie to date that deals with drug addiction in such an utterly realistic way. forget Trainspotting, or any other of the hundreds of drug movies out there, this is the only one that doesn't glorify addiction. the only one that actually shows the realistic horror of it.The age restriction is 18R for a very good reason, the sequence near the end depicting the climax of the four character's torment has been described as one of the most disturbing scenes in film, and yes, it really is disturbing.But looking past all the violence, i have never seen such brilliant cinematography, acting and editing in my life. the development and portrayal of the characters was nothing less than genius. this movie offers no respite, no happy endings, nothing but utter realism.if you've ever taken drugs, or even considered it, watch this movie. it will be like pouring a bucket of ice over your head.it definitely deserves ten out of ten, just make sure you have a shrink, a toilet bowl, and a few good friends handy after you've seen it.",10,1,2,11 February 2006
