Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another amazing feat by Lucas
","Critics (and fans alike) have really been ripping this movie apart, analyzing every nuance of the film, and generally, given it something of a bad rap coming out of the gate.  I think the special effects were incredible, this was a breathtaking film visually.  The new characters are great, I can see a lot of potential for them in the next two films - particularly Ewan MacGregor's Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman's Padme/Queen Amidala.  I will concede that Jar-Jar probably takes some getting used to... I don't think the acting is dry in the least, nor do I think the story is farfetched - although conception plotline is a bit of a headscratcher, but the great and powerful George will reveal all in due time.  Instead, it's everything Lucas promised: a solid background on the events of Episodes IV - VI, seamless computer generated effects, another brilliant score from John Williams...in general, a fabulous moviegoing experience.  The major lightsaber duel at the end was probably my favorite part - all the elements (music(!), imagery, acting, dramatic tension) came together beautifully.  It does stick close to the format from A New Hope, but hey - if it a'int broke, don't fix it.  I think people are taking this whole thing too seriously - don't nitpick the film to death.  Just sit back, and enjoy the ride.  And if you can do that - you'll have a damn fun time.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
