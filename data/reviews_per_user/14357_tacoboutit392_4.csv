It," ...
",The cheesy 1990 miniseries is far superior Despite the hype this adaptation was a real letdown The kids were great however the the CGI was awful and the jump scares were cheap Bill Skarsgard Hard to tell between him and the CGI This adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul All we have here is a CGI clown terrorising some kids There is no depth to the story of his origins There is no proper backstory regarding the kids There is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book and the original miniseries encapsulated No atmosphere whatsoever Its not a bad film but highly lacking.,Null,2,3,14 November 2018
BlacKkKlansman," So good!
",It's so realistic and accurate to my everyday life and I can relate as a person of color myself. David Duke is literally evil and good always wins over that which is why I love this real life movie.,Null,7,12,14 November 2018

Fantastic Mr. Fox," Oh my gosh.
",So cute and funny is what this movie is especially with the fuzzy creatures that are super cute and relatable to a person like me I can't believe it's not real life is how good it looks but it isn't perfect just really good,Null,0,2,14 November 2018
