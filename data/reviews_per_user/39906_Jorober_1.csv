Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Anyone who understands Star Wars will love this movie!!!
","First of all I want to say that for those professional movie critics who didn't like this movie, get a new job!  You obviously have no taste!!!! I have totally lost my respect for movie critics.I watched the movie this morning and absolutely loved it.  It has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  George Lucas did a wonderful job on this movie.  The story-line is awesome, but you have to keep in mind that this is the first of a series of books/movies, so you really should feel like you have just been thrown into this story head first.  The characters are excellent, even Jar Jar Binks who's getting a bad wrap.  He is not annoying at all!  He was really funny.  The character development was exactly how it should be.  This is a must see for anyone who went to see the originals!!!Now stop reading unless you want to know what happened.  Some people have criticized the idea of Anakin falling in love with Queen Amidala. Well it doesn't even happen.  He views her as a mix of a friend, and a sort of mother-figure, since he was just separated from her.  He doesn't fall in love with her.  He didn't know how he blew up the space ship by hitting the reactor, so there is no way he would know how to prevent the Rebels from doing the same thing when he becomes Darth Vader.  Jar Jar was not put in the movie for the kids.  He is just an entertaining character that already existed in the book so George Lucas put him in the movie, since it was based on the book!  The story-line makes perfect sense.  It flows excellently and fits in with the movies we have already seen.  It is well developed and is very much a big part of the movie.  The acting is excellent, and yes Natalie Portman's acting is excellent.  The special effects were excellent, and not at all overdone.  The sound was perfect, not to soft, not too loud.  For those of you who say that it looked like a few actors with a fake background, what movie were you watching?  Because it wasn't TPM!For all those of you who submit reviews that say it was a bad movie, if you don't have the guts to even put your name on it, don't bother.  Your opinion is worthless.Ratings: (Out of 5)Story: 4 Acting: 5 Effects: 5 Character Development: 5 Predictability: 4 (not very predictable) Overall: 4.6",10,0,0,1 June 1999
