The Ring," One of the best horror movies in the last decade
","This was a freaky movie that will definitely have a sequel.  It has an exciting plot and is original.  It doesn't follow typical 'cookie cutter' type horror flicks.  While it is not as good as the Excorcist, it is not a huge distance behind.   It is the best new horror film that I have seen in years and years.   9.5 Stars",9,1,1,28 June 2003
Stripes," Great 80's comedy
","This is one of the best 80's comedies out there.  Think of the cast... Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy, John Larroquette, Judge Reinhold and Dave Thomas.  You can even see Bill Paxton if you look closely.   These are the classic comedians of the 80's.   9.5 Stars.",10,0,1,28 June 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Classic. Beyond Funny.
","First of all, let me preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of South Park the TV show.  While I find the TV show amusing, I do not watch it more than once every few months.  So I had doubts about the movie, but my brother insisted I watch it.  So I did and ended up purchasing the DVD the next day.All comedy aside, this is one of the most masterfully written movies I have ever seen.  The songs are hilariously funny and the way that they incorporate all the individual songs into one masterpiece is sheer genius. Probably one of the best musicals I have seen.As for the humor, don't watch this if you are easily offended, because you will be offended.Funny, funny, funny.   10 stars.",10,39,45,28 June 2003
Finding Nemo," Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!
","I have seen a ton of movies in my life, but few are better than Finding Nemo.  The storyline is excellent.  The animation is out of this world. The humor is witty and plays to both children and adults alike (perhaps even more so toward the adults).   The cast is great and convincing.  If you liked the Toy Stories, then you'll love this.  If you have never checked out a Pixar film, you are missing out.   This is worth buying before renting. I could have paid $25 at the box office and still felt I got my money's worth.  10 stars.",10,0,0,27 June 2003
Dead Poets Society," Wonderful, touching, extraordinary
","This movie is outstanding.  Robin Williams never gets enough credit for his acting ability.   This movie is extremely well done as he plays a renegade teacher who teaches his students lessons in life that they will never forget.  This movie seems to get better each time I have seen it.  If you liked this, you may also enjoy 'With Honors.' 10 Stars.",10,0,1,28 June 2003
Glory," Outstanding Civil War movie
","If you would like to see a great movie that also is educational about the Civil War, this is it.  Many high school students watch this for US History class.   The acting in this movie is beyond outstanding.  Matthew Broderick gives his best ever performance.  Cary Elwes is great.  Andre Braugher (better known from Duets) is excellent.  Morgan Freeman is brilliant.  And lastly, Denzel gives perhaps his best performance.  The musical score is top notch and the action is exciting.There is also a 2 disc special edition DVD set.   9.8 Stars.",10,0,0,28 June 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Boo! No Boo's, Only Cheers!!!
","I just finished watching this movie for the first time.   I had high expectations since it was coming from Pixar.  My expectations were met and exceeded.   This movie is e-x-c-e-l-l-e-n-t!!!!   If you liked the Toy Story movies, then you will definitely like this one.   In fact, you can see Buzz Lightyear and Woody in the film if you look closely.  Also, which I find quite hilarious, you can see some forecasting of their next movie, Finding Nemo.  The little girl picks up a fish that looks exactly like Nemo.   Of all the Pixar movies, I would say that Nemo is the best, but Monsters is not far behind.   Both adults and children will love it.  John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi are outstanding.  If you have never seen a Pixar film, you are really missing out!!!   10 Stars.",10,0,1,29 June 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Great 3rd Movie!!! Go see it!!!
","I just got back from seeing T3 and it was all it was hyped up to be and then some.   The action sequences in this movie are outstanding.  It is great to see a movie that relies more on stunts (whenever possible) than special effects for a change.  The movie takes place from where the last movie left off and stays in context with the storyline from the previous movies.  T3 also provides more 'comic relief' than the previous two.  While some of the jokes were very cheesy, they were well placed and provided some humor to the film, similar to something out of the Indiana Jones' series. 
The female terminator was a good villain (and hot).   The action sequence where Arnold gets ripped through a building on a crane is one of the best 'chase' scenes in recent memory.  A bit of trivia is that the movie was overbudget and Arnold paid $1.4 million out of his own pocket to have the scene shot.  Finally, the best part of the movie, and the reason why I am giving this movie such a high score, is the ending.   The ending is brilliant and I would encourage you to see the movie as quickly as possible before someone ruins the ending for you.  Placing this movie in the action genre, I would have to give it 10 stars since this movie certainly fits in the categorial rating of 'excellent.' The action is exciting and original, the plot is solid and the ending is outstanding.   Alliteration:  Another Amazing Arnold Action Adventure.",10,0,0,2 July 2003
The Shining," Must see!!! One of the best ever...
","If you are looking for a great scary movie that you will never forget, this is the movie to see.   Definitely one of the greatest horror flicks ever made.  Jack's performance is one of the greatest ever on the silver screen.
There is also a special edition DVD with deleted scenes.10 Stars.",10,0,1,27 June 2003
The Patriot," Solid Mel Gibson Movie
","If you like Mel Gibson movies and/or are interested in the Revolutionary War, then this is probably a great choice for you.  If you stop and think about it, Mel is one of the few actors that almost every movie he is in is a good film.  This movie has drama, action and is full of emotion.  People that enjoyed 'Glory' may also enjoy this.   8.5 Stars.",8,0,2,29 June 2003
Jarhead," Jarhead = 'Three Kings' Meets Poor Man's 'Full Metal Jacket'
","We went to see Jarhead with high expectations. After seeing the film, it didn't live up to those expectations.While it certainly wasn't a 'bad' movie, it wasn't a great one either. The movie did have some very funny parts to it and the absurdity of war was certainly shown in the forefront.However, this was really just a poor attempt to make a great film by taking bits and pieces from other films already made. I mean they even put in actual footage from Apocalypse Now! And the beginning of the movie might just as well have been the Dollar Store's version of Full Metal Jacket with the drill instructor pathetically trying to be R. Lee Ermey. The notion of the absurdity of war was 'borrowed' right from Three Kings (but used in a different way). And the list went on and on.Is the movie worth watching? Yeah, sure... but you might as well wait for it to come out on DVD. However, if you are in the armed forces (thank you for your service to our country), you might want to see it in the theatre as you would probably relate to the movie much better than us civilians.It did give a different perspective regarding the life of a Marine which was interesting, but all in all it just wasn't anything special. However, I will say that Jamie Foxx did a nice job of acting in the movie.I'd say go watch this film and then go watch Full Metal Jacket and you'll realize the sheer genius of Stanley Kubrick. People wonder why the box office is losing money... it's because the quality of film making today pales in comparison with many of the greats of the past.Anyway, this movie gets a 6 out of 10. 'Oo-rah.'",6,1,2,17 November 2005
The Usual Suspects," Unusually Exceptional Film
","This movie is outstanding.  The best advice I can give you is to NOT read ANY comments about this movie, as it will ruin it for you!!!  Just go out and rent (if not buy) this movie!   Easily one of the best movies that I have ever seen.   It keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly.  The best part is, that once you finish the movie, you will most likely want to put it right back in and watch it again immediately.   The actors are excellent and the plot is superb.  Other movies that you might like if you like this are:  Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Swimming with Sharks.   10 huge stars for The Usual Suspects.",10,0,1,28 June 2003
City of God," Tarantino Lovers...
","I give City of God a brilliant 10 stars. I rented this DVD solely based on seeing the high score it received here on IMDb. It currently ranks in the Top 20 movies on here of all time and rightfully so.If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, then without question, you definitely need to check this film out. While Quentin did not direct this, the style is very similar to most of his flicks. In fact, 'City of God' far surpasses anything done by QT.This movie has it all... action, suspense, comedy, gangs, mystery, drugs, violence and even a little romance thrown in here and there.The entire movie is subtitled, but the film is so good that you will be forgetting that the subtitles are there after 5 minutes or so.Finally, the film is completely original and there is nothing out there that closely resembles it. The characters and the acting are superb. These are seriously some of the best characters to ever appear on the Silver Screen. You'll love some of the characters, hate some of the characters, but you will be emotionally involved with all of them due to the superb writing that went into the script. It's a great movie and I highly recommend renting it ASAP.Happy Viewing!",10,2,5,28 June 2005
Caddyshack," Top Notch! Top Notch!
","Another of the greatest comedies of the 80's.  You don't need to understand golf to find this hilarious.  Chevy, Rodney and Bill... what more can you ask for?   Some of the greatest Sportscenter lines come from this movie. Must see.   10 Stars.Think twice before renting Caddyshack 2 though.",10,2,4,28 June 2003
Saw," If you liked The Usual Suspects...
","... then you should watch Saw. While it is completely different from The Usual Suspects, it has the same brilliant theme taking place in the background, of having the viewer never knowing exactly who is behind the scenes pulling the strings.If you want to watch a movie that is completely original and that will keep you guessing, this is it!!! If you want to watch the same 'cookie cutter' movie where you know exactly what the ending will be 15 minutes into the feature, then this is not the movie for you.Are there some 'holes' in the movie that don't add up 100%? Of course there are, but they are extremely minor, especially for a horror movie.In any event, if you want to watch a great thriller that will stimulate your mind, go and check out Saw!",9,0,1,24 April 2005
National Treasure," Indiana Jones/James Bond Wanna-Be Flick
","I give this movie a 4.5 out of 10.If you want to watch a good comedy, this is the movie for you. The comedy from this movie stems from the fact that it is so bad, it is actually sort of amusing.This entire movie is basically a pathetic version of 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.' The only real difference (besides the poorly written script) is that the treasure hunting takes place in the United States instead of Europe. Notice that the Last Crusade has a rating of above 8 on here and is currently ranked in the Top 150 movies on IMDb of all time, whereas National Treasure has a weak 6.6 rating (at the time of this post). In reality the gap between the quality of these two movies is massive... it's the difference between winning the SuperBowl and your high school league championship.There are a few funny parts to the movie and overall the acting was above average. However, the mistakes and inaccuracies throughout the movie were laughable at best. Based on the movie, it might be easier to steal the Declaration of Independence than it would be to steal an article of clothing from your local department store. LOL All of the main items in the National Archives can immediately be dropped down into vaults that can withstand a nuclear holocaust, so the lack of security shown in the movie was simply hilarious. Many websites need you to include at least one number in your password for security purposes, but not the National Archives. I used to work at a bank and everything involving the vault involved at least two people for security reasons... but at the National Archives in this movie, Cage can just waltz right in by himself since double authorization apparently doesn't happen in the institution that houses our most precious documents. (roll eyes) Omissions like these occur throughout the movie and make much of it totally implausible.Anyway, if you really like treasure hunting and can look past the terrible writing along with the wanna-be James Bond/Indiana Jones character, then rent it. But there are many better options out there to watch in my opinion.Good luck and happy viewing!",4,0,1,13 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the Latest Trilogy
","Wow! Lots of expectations, lots to live up to and nowhere to go but down. However Lucas does a masterful job of putting together his finest work of the new trilogy.The opening scenes of the movie make you feel like you are on 'Star Tours' in Disneyland. The action looks close to 3D and makes you almost feel like you are in the action yourself. This beginning is the best special effects sequence I have ever witnessed on the big screen.Oh and in case you didn't know, Mr. Lucas plans to re-release all 6 movies (one per year) in the theaters starting in 2007 (the 30th anniversary of Star Wars) all in 3D!!!! Moving right along, this was one of the most bizarre events in movie history. That being that everyone knows about the Star Wars characters and thus, everyone knew what this movie was going to be about years ago. However, knowing what was to come in advance did not spoil anything as Vader's transition to the Dark Side was extremely dark and exceeded expectations. The Emperor cast his shroud of pure evil convincing Anakin to become Darth Vader.And for all of you that say 'what about this little detail and that little detail,' I say who cares! That is the genius of Lucas. He doesn't really care about every tiny, minute detail as he knows he can never perfectly match up EVERY single tiny detail between the two trilogies. If you want proof of that, then he never would have added in the scene with the CGI Jabba scene on the New Hope DVD where Harrison Ford calls Jabba 'a wonderful human being' (a scene that was never printed on the original release as Ford was talking to a human playing the role of Jabba). Lucas knew that this would be an error, but knew those who were intelligent enough would 'get it.' However, if you want to talk about great storytelling, go back and watch the original trilogy (IV-VI). You will see that Vader's transformation to the Dark Side by the Emperor was eerily similar to how Vader attempted to turn Luke to the Dark Side in Empire Strikes Back. Furthermore, as just one more example of many, in Empire Strikes Back, Yoda forces Luke into the cavern where he faces what he believes to be Vader. He chops off Vader's head only to reveal Luke's own face in the helmet. This is clearly reflected in the Revenge of the Sith when Anakin is having the nightmares (future revelations) about Padme. Both of these events foretold possible paths down the avenue of the Dark Side for the father and son.Additionally, we get to see how many of Anakin's comments from Attack of the Clones foreshadowed events in the Revenge of the Sith. Comments about having the power to prevent others from dying, having one person lead the Senate like a dictator, becoming the most powerful Jedi ever, etc, etc, etc. These comments made for a smooth transition between Episodes II and III. Moreover, items such as the triangular shaped Star Destroyers, plans for the original Death Star, Chewbacca, the emergence of the StormTroopers, Yoda's final assignment to Obi-Wan, etc all made outstanding tie-ins between episodes III and IV.When all is said and done, this entire 6 episode saga is about one thing... the story of a family. In episode I, Anakin leaves his only family (his mother) to join a new family (the Jedi). In episode II, he loses his only real family as his mother dies, only to gain a new member in Padme. In III, Anakin is so scared of losing his only real family, that his fear leads him to the Dark Side as his hatred leads him to kill off his former Jedi family. In episode IV, it is Luke who loses his only family, his Uncle and his Aunt who were like his parents. In V, it is revealed that Vader is Luke's father and in VI, it is the father that saves the son and Luke is reunited with his sister that he did not know that he had. So in the end, it was Anakin who betrayed his surrogate family (the Jedi) while Luke did not betray his surrogate family (Han, Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan, etc). It was Anakin who did bring balance to the Force by killing the Emperor and saving his blood family. Furthermore, Anakin redeems himself with the Jedi family as evidenced by Yoda, Anakin and Obi-Wan together at the end of Return of the Jedi.In Revenge of the Sith, Lucas masterfully transforms a Darth Vader that was previously thought of as 'pure evil' into a figure of tragedy. And not so ironically, it is implied that perhaps if Anakin did not switch to the Dark Side that Padme could have possibly lived (as evidenced by Obi-Wan being in the second dream sequence... if Anakin had not switched over, Obi-Wan and Padme never would have been together in that exact place in that exact situation as they went in search of the new Darth Vader). And had Obi-Wan killed Anakin, who knows if the Emperor ever would have been stopped, as it was Vader who ends the Emperor's reign by killing him in Return of the Jedi. Yoda could not stop the Emperor in Revenge of the Sith and Luke could not defeat him in Return of the Jedi, so it could be assumed that if Anakin were killed, that perhaps no one would have ever defeated the Emperor and returned peace to the galaxy.As you can see, it all comes together masterfully.In conclusion, GO SEE THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN!!!! Well done Mr. Lucas!",10,10,21,21 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Classic movie with much more than just special effects...
","Where to begin.  This is one of the great movies of all time.  Why?  Some of the many reasons include:1) The special effects were way ahead of their time.2) Some of the greatest heroes and villains ever created are introduced in this movie.3) The plot is excellent.  Many people see Star Wars as a special effects film, but it is so much more. To only watch one movie is like picking up a novel and then throwing it away after only finishing one-third of the book.   You need to watch all three and see it as a whole.  This is not a story about cool effects, but rather it is the story of a boy and his father.  It is a personal story that is cleverly concealed within a bigger plot.  Think about it... 'I am your father Luke' is still one of the most famous lines in movie history.And the characters.   How many villains can you name that are more well known than Darth Vader?   And what about the heroes of Luke, Han, R2D2, C3PO and Yoda?   Oh yeah, and what about one of the coolest weapons every to grace the silver screen... the lightsaber.A bit of trivia... ever wonder how the main character got his name?  Luke Skywalker or 'Luke S.' as in George 'Lucas.'   :)Anyway, this is a must see movie that should be watched as the first chapter of a three chapter story.   10 Stars.",10,0,0,29 June 2003
Thirteen Days," Great JFK movie
","While I was not yet born during JFK's days in office, I found this movie extremely interesting and educational.   Kevin Costner turns in his usual outstanding performance as the Special Assistant to President Kennedy. Bruce Greenwood is brilliant as JFK as is Robert Culp as RFK.  It really made you feel as if you were in the Oval Office during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  If you are interested in this period of history or are a Costner fan, then this movie is for you.   9 Stars.",9,0,1,29 June 2003
Coach Carter," 'Lean on Me' meets 'Miracle'
","I give this movie 7 stars.All in all this is a good movie. As the title suggests, it is basically 'Lean on Me' (Morgan Freeman) merged together with 'Miracle' (Kurt Russell).Of course the sport here is basketball instead of ice hockey, but the story is very good.Jackson's performance was solid as expected and the supporting cast made the story believable. While it certainly was not the best sports movie ever made, it is based on a true story and is worth a rental if you like Samuel Jackson and/or if are into sports movies.Happy Viewing!",7,3,3,26 June 2005
