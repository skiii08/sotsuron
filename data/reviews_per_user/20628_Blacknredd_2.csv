Requiem for a Dream," I really hate these kinds of movies
","I have to say, I really hate movies like Requiem For A Dream. From a technical standpoint, Requiem is an excellent movie.  Based off the Selby novel from the late 70's, Requiem follows the lives of four drug addicted New Yorkers. Ellen Burstyn plays Sarah Goldfarb, a lonely widow who spends most of her time watching infomercials and longing for her deceased husband.  After she receives a phone call notifying her that she is in the running to appear on T.V., Sarah becomes ecstatic.  She gets her hair done, and pulls out her favorite red dress to wear to the show.  Sarah finds however, that she can no longer fit in her dress.  After a failed diet, a quack doctor prescribes her 'uppers' which, though effective for weight-loss, ultimately drive her insane.  Her son, played by Jared Leto is a heroine addict who also deals with his buddy, played by Marlon Waynes.  Leto's girlfriend Mary, played by Jennifer Connelly is also addicted, and dreams to one day open a clothing store.As  I said, technically this film is excellent.  The cinematography, along with the soundtrack and acting all complement each other.  It's just the horribly depressing plot which keeps this movie from being one of my favorites.  There is no comic relief, and the characters keep falling deeper and deeper. Watch it once, and see.  Maybe you can handle it better than I. (7/10)",7,0,1,9 June 2002
8 Mile," Good, but definitely not great...
","It was inevitable that Eminem would get his own movie, but everyone questioned whether or not Marshal Mathers, a kid from Detroit with absolutely no experience in acting, could pull it off.  Eminem does in fact do a sufficient job, but overall, there's nothing too special about 8 Mile.  The script is quite old fashioned, any by that I mean it seems to follow soem of the harsh guidlines that were formerly imposed on films.  You know, the 'Anyone that does wrong must be punished before the end of the movie.' In otherwords, the good guy is going to emerge as a winner in the end of this movie.  From nearly the very first scene, it's very apparent as to which way this film is going and how it will most likely end. 
  But the script is somewhat redeemed by surprisingly good acting.  Eminem, as I stated earlier, does a pretty good job as Jimmy Smith Jr., but Phiefer, Bassinger and Murphy all give good performances, which really helps move the script along.  Normally, I would give this movie a 6.  However, there is one aspect to the movie that I really liked and that was the sparing or rap battles.  I doubt the ones that made the movie were impromptu, but regardless, the battles flowed extremely well, and they were undoubtely the best part of the movie.  The crowd interaction was great as well, making me feel as if I were actually in Detroit, watching one of these battles live.  In fact, I wish there were more of these battles in the movie.  4 addition, actually improvised battles were included in the DVD, and those were great.  If they had been in the movie, I would have given it a 8, but since they were not, 8 mile receives a 7/10.",Null,0,0,23 March 2003
