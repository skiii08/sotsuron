National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National Treasure: Book of Bad Plotting
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets, is a decent action film that suffers from the inevitable decease that it has to follow a top notch action adventure movie NT 1. The writers of this one must have had some difficulties setting up the plot, because more than once are there scenes taken almost directly from the first one, though set in Paris or London this time around. Especially the whole plot revolving the villain is almost copy-pasted from the original, however, the writers just never get around to explaining Wilkinson(the villain)properly, and it results in his switching around from bad guy to good guy three or four times during the last 45 min. An example of this is that he apologizes for smearing Ben Gates' great-great grand dad and five minutes later he holds a blade to Diane Kruger throat if he isn't allowed to leave the horrible booby traps first.Also, Ben Gates, who in the first one really showed his skill as a treasure hunter using only his brain, seems to get a lot of help from the writers to suddenly realise the nature of his quest, without really having to put an effort into it. The movie seems to have been made in order to make a quick buck, as the first was a huge success, the execs (Bruckheimer) and director Jon Turteltaub do not seem to have made much effort in telling a cohesive story, but seem more engaged in selling tickets.",3,1,2,21 September 2009
Pirate Radio," The Boat of Feeling Good!!
","'The Boat That Rocked' is one of the best feel-good films I have seen in a long time. The cast is a tight knit group that supports each other superbly. However, Bill Nighy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Nick Frost and Rhys Ifans are the pillars in the film as their characters are larger than life. It doesn't mean that the rest of the cast is unimportant, far from it. You get to love each character for what they are. Like 'The School Of Rock' and 'Almost Famous' the music plays a character as well. It drives the movie forward and supports the emotions of the cast. The scene with a heart broken Simon (Chris O'Dowd) always brings a lump to my throat.It's not a big story but it's such a good one that just makes my day every time I watch it. Like 'The School Of Rock' it's a movie I can watch no matter when...be warned though...when you've seen it you want to listen to this music for the next many hours. For me it has meant a lot of sleepless nights, but they've been spent in good company.",Null,1,2,30 January 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Damn good entertainment! Lousy script!
","There are those who will be hitting themselves for paying to see this film, and I don't blame them! It is by far one of those films that are based on nothing more than an idea. Dennis Quaid does some of the worst acting I have ever seen, being a superman in disguise as he climbs every mountain to safe his son (Gyllenhall) from freezing to death. It is really a terrible movie. However, it is one of those films you can watch again and again as the action begins almost immediately. You don't have to sit through a lot of talk or unnecessary explanations. Everything you need to know is being conveyed to you within the first ten minutes of the film, making you able to just detach your brain and watch how nature finally kicks man's butt! Go nature!So my advise is watching this after a night out or if you're just feeling down, as this surely will get you in a good mood again. From laughing.",7,0,0,20 September 2006
The Patriot," Yes it is a BAD movie....
","....but my word it's entertaining.Mel Gibson portrays a farmer Benjamin Martin who's greatest goal in life is to live peacefully and taking care of his children...and to build a rocking chair that doesn't break. When the colony of South Corolina enters the revolutionary war he reluctantly sees his eldest son Gabriel (the late GREAT Heath Ledger) join the regular army. By the cruel hand of fate his second eldest son is killed and Gabriel is taking prisoner, from here on Benjamin has to take action in order to save his son and finds himself drawn into the fight for a free country.Yes it is a bad movie and it is by no means historically accurate, far from it, and that is not really it's purpose. The purpose of the film is to tell a compelling story about a man doing extra ordinary things under extra ordinary conditions, and as such it works. It does not have the same feel to it as Braveheart, which it clearly tries to copy. Where Braveheart to some degree was very serious and took itself very seriously.The Patriot tells roughly the same story but here 'Braveheart' has grown a little older and has a family who he fights for. The movie has two parts: part one where it goes really well for the militia Benjamin leads along with his son and a French officer (Tchéky Karyo, who I think they got because Jean Reno isn't fat and Gerard Depardieu is too old) sent to train the militia. Part two the militia is being hunted by Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) and who uses very un-gentlemen-like methods to drive them out.Mel Gibson has played this part a lot in recent years and it shows as he most of the movie runs on auto pilot and relies on his eyes and his Lethal Weapons mannerisms. Jason Isaacs is also very stereotypical and one wonders if really wanted to be there.This was a lot of bad things, but really the movie IS entertaining because you can watch it without having to think...at all...I know Roland Emmerich has been criticized for making such films, especially his Armageddon epic The Day After Tomorrow, but i really think there has to be room for that kind of movie as well. As a movie critic on Danish television so rightly said today: sometimes you have to watch the bad to appreciate the good......I like to watch this movie anyway...it's just good entertainment.",8,0,2,6 June 2008
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Thought I hated it...
","...turns out I love it!For a very long time this movie was my absolute least favorite of all the HP films. It has largely to do with the fact that the cinematography changed massively from the first two to this one and I had trouble adapting to this new cinematic style.However, after a recent HP marathon I came to the conclusion that Alfonso Cuarón was able to capture the darker mood of the book much better than Chris Columbus ever would have been able to, and in fact seems to have a better grip on the universe than the following directors (read David Yates). In Columbus' movies the childlike innocence worked as Harry hasn't begun to fathom the elements of his life and his parents death, but he would not have been able to turn this book into the great movie it is. Although Cuarón changed a lot of the ways Hogwarts looks it actually is better as in this way the wildness of the Scotish mountainside really becomes much more profound.The elements of the book that were significant for understanding the story were well explained and as a coherent story it works very well. The actors all did a really good job and Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton all showed that they have grown since the first two films and particularly Emma Watson was allowed to show her qualities as an actress (a feat she has been so incredibly denied since David Yates took over).The new characters introduced were also great casted David Thewliss as the soft spoken, haunted Remus Lupin quite simply stole every scene he had on screen with his underplaying. He fitted the part perfectly and he really conveyed the love he had for Harry's parents as well as the affection he has for Harry with exceptional artistic quality. As for the rugged and insane Sirius Black, no one else could have played the part as well as Gary Oldman. Unfortnately he isn't on screen much, but in the few scenes he has he really nails the essence of his character. Now Michael Gambon had some pretty big shoes to fill, and I feel that he never completely steps out of the shadow of Harris (which also is felt in the sequels) however I must say that he is far more like the Rowling Dumbledore in this one than in the next three films. Also Timothy Spall shows his quality as the loathsome, pitiful Peter Pettigrew and you feel that the casting director had the best luck in the world with these positions (which I generally feel as not one single character within the entire HP universe could have been played by others than those who play them). All in all Harry Potter and Prizoner of Azkaban is probably my favorite so far, tied maybe with Goblet of Fire, and I (unlike previously) would have liked to see Alfonso Cuarón finish the series as I think he would have done a far better job than David Yates.",8,1,2,29 July 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Took me by surprise
","I did not know what to expect from this movie. I like animation films, but having been spoiled by Disney and Pixar, I don't really watch that many other types of animation. However I'm glad I gave this one a shot.Cloudy with a chance of meatballs has it all. A likable protagonist, an easy straight forward story, an occasionally creepy vibe when the food comes alive (those deep fried chickens crawling down from the ceiling like the orcs from The Felowship of the Ring, were pretty creepy). But what really got to me, was the relationship between the hero Flint and his blue- collar father Tim really pulled at the heart strings. It was beautifully crafted and had a good heart. Check it out.",8,1,1,23 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," It's going to be difficult with films 6 & 7
","I looked forward to this installment of the HP series as the book was the darkest of the bunch and really the first to set up the ominous future Harry has to meet.The screen writer however, falls flat in his attempt to cover the vast grounds laid out in the book, it is the longest of the series, but it results in the shortest film. David Yates, who for some reason has been chosen for the last movies puts too much emphasis on the visual sides to display the ongoing battle within Harry, and it doesn't quite work and here's why. Through all the books, no matter what happened to Harry and his friends J-RO makes sure to tell that the surroundings look exactly the same as before the terrible things occurred. This means that you shouldn't make a summer day notorious for it's excessive heat and drought into a cloudy rather autumn looking day, as happens in the very beginning. The effect of the presence of Dementors in Little Whinging would be much more profound had the sky not already been murky. Furthermore, when Dementors approach it turns COLD NOT WINDY. The same feel does simply not come across in this one as with the previous films, particularly the first two films(and especially NOT the third). Furthermore Yates, and his screenwriter, simply don't understand the franchise they've inherited. Instead of putting things in the movies that has no place or omitting things that NEED to be there for a better understanding of the ongoing action and further development of characters, they should ALWAYS keep close contact with J-Ro and really make sure that IF they leave out things, that they are the RIGHT things, and not just things THEY feel are pointless.I would much prefer the more 'childlike' visions of Chris Columbus, than the new cinematography and editing initiated by Alfonso Cuarón, because it is more in tune with what Rowling writes. Also they should bring back John Williams for the last three movies as only HIS music have lifted the movies.It is the weakest second only to HP and the Halfblood Prince.",6,0,0,25 June 2008
The Da Vinci Code," a 'copy-paste' movie
","When a book is made into a movie, more often than not a lot of things are being erased, switched around or altered in order to make a cohesive film that the audience can enjoy.With the Da Vinci Code there isn't really that many changes, and it is basically because the original Dan Brown book is as close to a synopsis for a movie script as you can come.The movie follows the events of the book almost chronologically with some alterations which will always occur, but generally does not disrupt the flow of the story.However, when director Ron Howard and his scriptwriter chose to be as faithful to the book as they have, they have forgotten one important element: interpretation. There are basically no description or depiction regarding story, character or anything else that does not come straight from the book. This fact results in the movie not being able to assert its own position in the world of the Da Vinci Code, in which it now has entered, instead it gets reduced to a visual aid for the book. I perticularly found Tom Hank's Robert Langdon flat as a pancake. Hanks, who through movies such as Philadelphia and Forrest Gump really showed his awesome caliber as an actor, never really delwes into the character and makes it his own. Ron Howard and to some extent Dan Brown, had a pre-conceived idea as to how Langdon should walk, talk feel and act that Hanks seems cut out of any relation to this character. It gives him no room to manuver and he becomes a stooge giving his lines with an almost wooden feel, that doesn't entice the audience in anyway.The other main character Sophie Neveu is also just a pawn in the hands of the director. Audrey Tautou is, to an even greater extent than Hanks, left with nothing other than an already set idea and with even less material to work with. The writer has forgotten that the character Neveu has been trained in solving riddles by her grandfather, and as it is her grandfather who leaves all the traces for them to follow, you would think that she would be teaching the Harward professor a think or two, but that never happens. Of course it is difficult when dealing with a bestselling novel which the entire world has read and loved, to begin changing the story too much as you would than alienate a large portion of potential movie gooers. However, Ron Howard should have taken more time to think about the project and tried to really make it his own, rather than just 'copy-pasting' the book to screen.Instead of watching this movie, read the illustrated edition of the book, because then you get the exact same locations as are present in the movie, but you will be able to create your own images as well. The book is great in the sense that it actually invited the reader to think and guess alongside Langdon. This is not possible with the movie as Howard, while using every element in the book, still feels it necessary to explain that which would otherwise make the audience do their own thinking...you can't have a thinking audience...can you?",4,2,4,14 June 2009
300," Close to perfection
","The movie 300 is a magnificent cinematic feat. The pacing, the acting, the action and not to mention the cinematography. The look and feel of this movie surpasses other comic book movies where the source material is actually the storyboards. Movies like Sin City and Watchmen are good movies, but 300 manages to take it to another level. It's tight and lean. The plot of the movie is that the Persian army under the self-proclaimed god Xerxes is on the march to world domination. Their plan is to reach the European continent after taking over all of Asia Minor. But the Spartan King Leonidas refuses to be ruled as the entire Spartan code is derived from the notion of free will, and the Spartans way of maintaining that freedom is by being the best soldiers in the entire world. From infancy the male children are weighed and measured and if found wanting hurled to the wild animals. There is simply no room for weakness in the Spartan world. Leonidas marches off with 300 of his best men, under strong objections from the counsel and the in direct contradiction of the will of the gods, to stop the oncoming Persian hoards. He bottle necks them into a narrow mountain passage known to this day as the Hot Gates and the fiercest battles ensue. This movie thrives by its action sequences and taking at a glance you would think there is nothing more to this movie. You would, however, be cheating yourself to a fantastic piece of cinema. The acting equals in my opinion the visual side, helped a great deal by a tight and funny script. The characters are of course over the top but in this sort of movie they have to be. The Spartans live by the sword and all they crave for in life is a good death. Therefore their moral code has to be far and above what we today would find reasonable. Three characters who illustrate this is Leonidas played by Gerard Butler, Stelios played by Michael Fassbender and the Captain played by Vincent Regan. Butler and Fassbender are by now the most famous of the three mentioned, but the character that is best fleshed out is the Captain. Vincent Regan brings a sadness to the role that makes the Captain the most believable character of the bunch. Joining the 300 is his son so you know that he more than the rest of them, has emotions tied up in this even though they all are tough guys. He doesn't have that much screen time but his presence in the scenes lends a kind of voice of reason to the small army. He and the King are the only ones in the army who seem to understand that there is no way 300 men over time can stand their ground against a million Persians, they know this but still don't care. Fassbender plays the young soldier who is incredibly 'gung ho'. He and the Captain's son form a striking friendship and together they are a menacing force able to take on 30 men all by themselves, because they understand each other and know how they both move on the battlefield. Even though he is young there is nothing he craves more than 'a good death' as he explains to an Athenian soldier (the Athenians have joined forces with the Spartans to overthrow the yoke of tyranny), and he seeks it in every battle relentlessly. Everything in this movie is perfect: the acting, the story, the action, the cinematography, the costumes, the makeup, the score everything comes together so incredibly well in this movie. If you are a fan of movies than this is a must see movie. Nothing in this movie is out of place, pace or sync. It works on all levels.",10,3,6,21 July 2012
