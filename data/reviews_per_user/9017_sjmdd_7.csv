Alien 3," not as bad as id heard.... but poor compared to the first 2
","I only saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, id heard many dismal comments and reviews on it (including here on IMDb) and was not exactly jumping in anticipation. First of all, its fair to say i think, that the first 2 are classics.... Ridley Scott's masterful original and James Cameron's very different but equally enthralling sequel... fast forward 5 years and the concept of another one crops up. Why? In movie history hardly any of 3rd sequels better the originals... terminator, godfather,Halloween, nightmare on elm street, superman, batman,spiderman,scream, shrek, (the only example i can think of is lord of the rings : return of the king, which may well be the best in the series, only because the story came to a phenomenal conclusion), so there would be no reason to suggest that the alien Franchise would or should be continued... but therein says it all... alien and aliens were both very profitable so another one would surely bring em in... and whilst it did just that, the movie itself had so much to live up to it was never going to be on a par with its predecessors. David Fincher is a fine director( seven, curious case of Benjamin button) but the mistakes that were made has lead fincher to virtually disown the movie. so what exactly is wrong with it? by my reckoning, fincher had realised that to make an alien movie to similar to the first or second was not what the fans or even he wanted; so his choice to attempt to do something different from Scott and Cameron was ultimately( as well as the successes of the previous instalments) to blame for the movie not being all that good. killing off 2 major characters right in the beginning was his first mistake,and setting the movie with people you don't really give s damn about, well thats also a error. bar one or 2, we cant really get animated about such unlovely people. 3rdly, a very poor CGI monster which sadly (see first 2 movies for real monsters)takes ALL the suspense out of it, its so obviously fake looking its laughable. combine these three flaws with a dull, leggy (fincher probably wanted atmospheric)direction and lack of suspense or pace and towards the end we actually want it to be over... something you could never say about the first 2. we must forgive fincher his mistakes, he was young and inexperienced.he has matured into an excellent director, instead blame the greedy film company who couldn't resist another chance to make a quick buck and destroying a great horror series in the process.",5,0,0,22 July 2009
Orphan," entertaining little horror flick
","I saw this movie last night and despite mixed reviews (some were positive to the point of excellent whilst some denounced it as boring trash with a silly secret) i was pleasantly surprised at the decency of this movie - I'm not calling it a masterpiece, I've seen better movies in general, but nor would i rubbish it either. The twist ending is in fact not the best part of 'Orphan'... despite the ending being quite intelligent and original. The movie develops in two distinct halves, the first part we have a very subtle, psychological, dark film with emphasis placed on characterisation, we see and understand the motivations behind the characters and in terms of letting the mood develop, it has a dark, edgy vibe that works well, ditto the creepy Esther is introduced to us and she proceeds to intrigue us, whilst we learn nothing about her. The second part of the movie moves on from the subtleness and into terror, as we begin to see exactly what this little girl is all about. The violence eventually goes over the top and in the end, it becomes incomprehensible, but OTT cannot ruin what came before, the early parts of the film an excellent way to utilise suspense in an interesting and intriguing manner. Overall I'm giving the movie 7/10, the story was good and kept me interested, whilst the performance from 12year old Isabelle Furhmann as Esther is astonishing. that child is definitely one to watch. Overall, worth a look if you enjoy unusual horror movies. David Ford",7,1,2,20 August 2009
Ocean's Twelve," vapid shallow egotistical romp
","ego Clooney ego Pitt ego Julia Roberts, ego ego ego ego ego.... a 'movie' (if by a movie you mean something that you watch in order to be entertained, in which case I'm mistaken) that is so up its own backside it very nearly disappears (or maybe it never began!) into a self contrived hypermarket of Hollywood stars, made by the actors FOR the actors. clearly, audience participation here was non compulsory, all the actors on show here had such a good time with the first (as did we) and it being so lucrative the studio probably had plans to make another before production finished on the first. unfortunately, they forgot (or didn't really care), for the sequel to write any kind of decent script or any attempt at a plot. the actors are all having fun, but unfortunately, they forgot WE pay to watch, and Pitt especially smugs and grins his way through the 'movie' with a 'I'm a star and I'm proud of it' look on his face. add to Julia Roberts playing, well Julia, and a totally pointless cameo from Willis and it leaves you with a kind of bloated feeling, like you just took an ego overdose. personally, its not something i could sit through again. simply, flat and pointless. 2/10 David Ford",2,1,4,16 August 2009
Fargo," Should be heralded as one of the all time great movies
","You know when a movie is an absolute masterpiece, or a complete stinker, they are the easiest to review, hands down. Its the films that sit right in the middle that are hardest. Anyhow, without a shadow of a doubt Fargo falls into the former category. It was good the first time i saw it; now I've viewed it a second time it truly is a masterpiece of gargantuan proportions. There's so much right with this movie... in fact I'm unable to think of anything negative about it at all. The story, first and foremost, is a simple one. Jerry Lundegaard hires two crooks to kidnap his wife, whose father in law will pay the ransom, which Jerry will benefit from. But, like most Coen Brothers movies, nothing goes to plan. The Fact that the story is such a simple one is the first main reason why it works so well - don't necessarily over complicate the plot. Ethan and Joel know this, and in simplifying events, allow us to concentrate on the stunning script, the amazing performances and the frozen Minnesotan country. So events go awry... and we are introduced to police chief Marge Gunderson,Frances Mcdormand,AKA Mrs Joel Coen(who deservedly bagged an Oscar), one of the most endearing cinematic creations in recent memory. In a believable, simple way, heavily pregnant Marge puts together the pieces of a terrible crime gone oh so wrong. Its not that its so believable, nor the comic interpretation of the Scandinavian roots of Minessota, nor even the brilliant performances by Mcdormand, William H Macy (a career best), Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare interwoven with a biting, dark, often hilarious script,not even a marvellous score, no its the way in which, at the end, you manage to feel the way in which good prevails over evil a quite riveting and fascinating affair - even with a body count of 7 people, it never feels overly violent. Humanity wins hands down, and that, coupled with all of the above, means that it is in my book, one of the greatest movies ever made. 10/10 David Ford",10,2,3,23 August 2009
The Thing," glorious gorious masterpiece
","For many people, John Carpenters swansong will always be Halloween, a taut brilliantly directed movie that continues to generate new fans over 30 years since its release. But for those who know carpenters work, he directed at least 3 other gems, one of those being the 1982 movie, the thing. ostensibly a remake of the 1951 movie the 'thing from another world', the movie begins with a helicopter chasing a dog, whom the occupants are trying to shoot, for which we have no idea why at this point. Carpenter is an expert when it comes to tension and suspense in his movies, right up there with Hitchcock in my opinion. the use of such tension in this movie is where carpenter excels,the master directors vision of a dark cold world perfectly instills the sense of dread and(later) paranoia all of the scientists at this research station feel. So they let this dog into the facility...and then the real terror begins. all the tension and great directing you like wouldn't work though if it were not for the absolutely astounding effects that to be honest are probably the best I've ever seen in cinema, horrifyingly gut wrenching spine ripping head tearingly real and convincing of an alien force that will absorb its host... all credit must go to rob bottin for these effects which with carpenter knowing exactly what to do (and when to do it) added together and we have an absolute corker of a movie which should be in the top 30 movies if all time and top 10 horrors. and yet it has never received the credit it deserves. why? no pun intended but perhaps the violence alienated some people? it is fantastically gory and anyone easily offended and under 16 should avoid at all costs, for the rest well, turn the lights off, get rid of any yakkers and ENJOY. 10/10 David Ford",10,1,2,14 August 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," An outstanding achievement - but not for modern viewers
","I watched this movie for the first time about 2 days ago, and id like to share my thoughts on the film. first allow me to explain my summary comment. (I'm not giving away any spoilers because i don't think there are any to give away) L o A was made during a time when movies had the word 'epic' rubberstamped all over them, in 1962, only three years after ben hur, 2 years after spartacus, 6 or 7 years after bridge on the river kwai, you get my point, when movies were made not necessarily to satisfy audience cravings, when visionary directors like David lean wanted to tell a story and the studio gave them whatever they wanted in order to achieve this. the movie runs in at very nearly 4 hours long, and i wont lie here, sometimes it feels like it. the length of the movie is, however the only criticism i can find, as acting, script,and cinematography are quite frankly out of this world and the sweat will run off you as lawrence frazzles in the heat. my point is that a great deal of young people will be unaccustomed to such attention to detail in a movie, when the answers are not thrust down your throat and somebody is not slaughtered every 5 mins. i realise I'm been cynical but the days when you could whack out a four hour masterpiece and expect your audience to lap it up are long gone.. but that does explain the low ratings, obviously from youngsters who viewed (part of)the movie and were bored stiff. well what did you expect? independence day? if your over 65, this movie is probably one of your all time favourites, but if your under 25, well, just avoid.",8,1,4,26 May 2009
Gran Torino," Eastwoods last hurrah?
","saw this movie the other day, heard much about it(all positive) and going by some of Eastwood's other directorial masterpieces, i couldn't wait. What i got surprised even me, hardened movie fan that i am, never had i expected Eastwood to come up with something so beautiful powerful and unforgettable.I'm not going to give the game away for those who haven't seen it, but here is a movie that'l have you struck silent at the end and thinking about it for days after. a movie so richly layered without a single false note, it has a rare power all of its own, and if it is Eastwood's swansong (in front of the camera or behind it, his performance as a grizzled Korean war vet is amongst his best)then what a way to go. along with unforgiven and million dollar baby, Eastwood may well retire with tag of 'best director in America' attached firmly to his belt. bravo. 10/10",10,1,7,22 July 2009
