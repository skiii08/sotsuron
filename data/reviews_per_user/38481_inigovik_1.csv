Come and See," Come & See
","Emir Klimov depicts through the most raw events, the reality that the Belarus, USSR's population suffered at the hands of the Nazi movement in 1943, and how humanity harms to itself to a maximum level. Florya is a teenager whose excitement and nationalism moves him to defend what is 'his'' along with the soviet partisans, he later realizes that there is nothing more bizarre in life than losing your family, seeing someone else's life fading away into the arms of war. After he has no one, Florya finds a truly purpose to join the military and fight with a cause. With such an striking control of the stead cam, Klimov makes us experience the war in a closer level to reality, his manipulation of sound, time and space makes us see beyond what the characters feel, and even if there isn't violence on the scene, a gesture, a movement, or a smile takes your breath away.",Null,1,1,16 June 2009
