It," Didn't, Won't See 'IT'
",I refuse to see movies depicting Children being murdered or terrorized. I refuse to read books about Children being murdered or terrorized. Why would anyone feel comfortable sitting in a movie theater enjoying and watching a movie about a clown that scares the heck out of Children? I think people who enjoy movies like 'IT' are stewing psychopaths or Child killers.,Null,2,20,8 September 2017
BlacKkKlansman," BlackkKlansman ~ Spike is the Master!
","A great movie that entertains while making bigotry and racism look evil and stupid! For you sensitive people, the language in the movie is crass, but necessary as Spike Lee rightfully thought such language needs to be in the film. Spike Lee is a genius at creating entertaining message films - Spike is the Master!",10,6,13,19 August 2018
