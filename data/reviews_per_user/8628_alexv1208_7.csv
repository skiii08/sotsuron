Casablanca," Review of Casablanca
","Casablanca is a persuasive pro-American film. It's fictional yet accurately portrays events that took place during world War II. The film has a large political influence, even Rick's character represents America's isolation from the war. The film is beautifully written and shot. Music plays a huge part in the film. It emphasizes the setting and feel of the film. As the mood of the characters change, so does the music. Even when the French sing their national anthem this adds so much to the film, and it becomes even more clear how passionate the French are about their country. The accents of the actors add to the mise-en scene, as well as the lighting in many of the scenes, such as the lighting in the restaurant, when everything is dim, the candles on the table are the only form of light, creating a certain mood. The movie is very fast paced, you can't look away for a moment or get out of your chair for a snack. There's always some new twist. Casablanca is a thrilling film to watch, and one that really lives up to it's expectations.",9,2,4,14 November 2010
Citizen Kane," Review of Citizen Kane
","Citizen Kane was written and directed remarkably well. The films consists of outstanding scenes and performances, cinematic and narrative techniques and experimental innovations, including sound and photography. The film was quite controversial at the time, having unflattering parallels to a real-life publisher. The film consists of a number of long takes, which create more meaning behind the actions and characters. These long takes draw the viewer in, because it's obvious that shots aren't edited together. The soundtrack is another important part of the film; it provides clues to Kane's behavior as he ages. One of the most notable scenes is when Kane walks (almost zombie-like) down a corridor lined with mirrors, where his reflection is multiplied. In this scene you realize that we all project a certain personality to people, and we often leave impressions behind. Here you get a sense that Kane is reflecting on who he has become. This also shows how well Orson Welles was able to perform, in addition to writing and directing the film, totally proving in today's world why he was so famous.",8,0,2,20 October 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Review of Grapes of Wrath
","Grapes of Wrath is a very real representation of what life was like during the Great Depression. There is an overall dark and depressing aspect to the film; families lost their land, homes, food, and great amounts of their wealth. Media tried to cover the reality of the situation by reporting deaths due to heart failure or stroke, instead of starvation, which was the reality. It was a trying time for many people, and Grapes of Wrath, shows what it was like for one family to lose their home to the Depression. All they want to do is go to California, but when they get to the land of 'Milk and Honey' there isn't as much hope there as they had thought. The camera work for this film was overall good. There were beautiful shots of the environment and land surrounding them. Although the film is a realistic interpretation of a very historical period in American history, it seems to be quite dull. John Ford (Director of the film) may have tried to make too much happen in the film. The family can never catch a break and there's no profound change, making the story seem somewhat repetitive and hard to sit through, and really enjoy/get into.",7,0,1,18 October 2010
The Graduate," Review of The Graduate
","The Graduate is funny and witty, yet intelligent and allegorical. It's an excellent representation of the 60's. The ending really shows what the 60's are all about. Ben and Elaine run off together, even though she's supposed to get married. They're are going against typical societal norms, which makes the storyline so compelling, and dramatic, not just comedic. In addition, the music in the film accentuates the whole feel of the movie. Simon and Garfunkel produced music specially for the film (scored music). Without this music, there wouldn't be nearly as dramatic of an effect as there is. The music evokes emotion and helps express the depths of the characters morals in each scene. The sound in the film also adds to the feel of the film. The famous pool scene when Ben goes into the pool with scuba gear on, you feel like you're in his place, because all you can hear is him breathing. The Graduate is a must see. It's emotional and riskay for it's time, but it really represents the gap in generations, and how the younger generation was going against society. Ben and Mrs.",10,1,1,9 December 2010
Psycho," Review of Psycho
","There is so much to be said about Psycho, from its profound cinematography to the provocative script. Alfred Hitchcock is well known for his horror films, and Psycho definitely proves why. The plot behind the movie really broke a mold for horror films during the 1960's. Movies were become more 'expressive', and leaving less unsaid, but Psycho revealed some truths behind sex and violence that weren't discussed in society. Alfred Hitchcock helped to change what society thought of as true terror. There was a realness to his films, unlike the studio era horror films. His use of the camera was truly remarkable. It's obvious that Hitchcock knew how to add suspense and fear. His way of showing the actor's reaction then what they were looking at, makes it feel like you are in the film. Also, the famous shower scene depicts how some things are better left to the imagination. Not because it's too much for the audience to handle, but because it makes the viewer think and fill in the blanks in a way. It was obvious that the woman had been killed, but it's more frightening in a way to leave out the whole scene. It adds that gasp effect. Clearly, Psycho was a somewhat ground breaking film, and really paved the way for horror films in general.",9,0,0,7 December 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Review of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was truly an incredible film. Everything on the screen seemed real, and makes you feel as if you're there in the mental institution. There is a real truth to the story, that makes the whole film believable, and since most of society doesn't know what it's like to be in that kind of setting, our attention is gained by experiencing something new. Jack Nicholson does a phenomenal job, expressing his anger towards Nurse Ratchet, as well as his passion for the other patients; helping them to improve themselves. The film brings out emotions in the viewer, sometimes you want to cry out of sympathy for the patients, other times you feel the anger McMurhphy has, you feel the frustration of the patients, and some fear towards the more 'crazy' patients. The film also has an important social message. It proves that not everyone is society is viewed for their true potential. It is hard not to judge someone by what we see, before we know them. Overall, a great film, but also heartbreaking.",9,1,2,15 December 2010
Saboteur," Review of Saboteur (1942)
","Soboteur was a good action packed film, but not one that I could really get in to. There's no doubt that Hitchcock is a great director, but this film just didn't have all the qualities that a movie like Psycho did. There were some great aspects of cinematography, but the acting and script were a little weak. There were some bad lines that discredited the film. Visually the film is appealing, with probably the most famous shot of the Statue of Liberty's arm. It's a great aerial view of the monument. The exciting visual elements are what keep the film together, and keep the viewers attention. Maybe if I was more of a Hitchcock fan, I would appreciate the film more.",6,1,3,14 November 2010
