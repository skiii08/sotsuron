Resident Evil: Afterlife," Anderson plumbs new directing depths!
","I have to admit that I didn't expect much out of this movie; it had two outstanding marks against it before the film even started to roll: it was based on a video game (and such films are rarely good) and the director is well known for shoddy work!This is a film of competitions. The script and story compete to be the most unbelievable, erratic and most non-existent while the actors compete to see who can deliver the few words they have in the blandest, most monotone way. Seriously - in many scenes the actors stare off into the distance (often in different directions) delivering stilted and cringe-worthy speeches in hoarse whispers.But the film isn't just that! Oh no, we also have some shockingly bad fight sequences which pause many, many, many times so that something can fly at the screen in slow motion or so we can fully appreciate these low quality, clichÃ©d 'Matrix' effects. The overall feel is that the fights have been created by a art student who has seen The Matrix too many times, but has only had three days to film, edit and market the whole thing! For me, this film had no redeeming qualities at all.",1,13,24,16 September 2010
