Blade Runner 2049," Worthy Sequel
","Just got in from seeing 'Blade Runner 2049'...crappy poster, excellent movie! It is a solid and worthy sequel to 'Blade Runner'(1982) and manages to recapture the look, feel, tone and cerebral nature of the original. A true sequel and not some reboot piece of sh*t! Solid story, characters, acting and music reminiscent of the original. Outstanding visuals, effects and art design. Musy be seen in Imax...Seriously! My only issue is the 2 hour and 45 minute running time! It is a 2hr & 15 minute movie trapped in a 2hr & 45 minute body! But if you are in for a penny, you are in for a pound, I guess. The pacing is my main issue with the original as well. As much as I love 'Blade Runner', it's like watching a movie through the prism of a fish tank... If you liked 'Blade Runner' you will dig this one (especially the nods to the original and some nice cameos)...If you don't like, or have not seen the original, this will totally be lost on you. It will be interesting to see how this does at the box office, since the original is a cult classic but flopped at the box office during it's initial run...It really needs to be nominated for 'Best Cinematography'",9,3,12,6 October 2017
Casablanca," An 8.5, really?
","How the hell does this classic masterpiece only rate an 8.5? One answer is the army of eye raped pseudo cinephiles who prefer the Fast and the Furious movies! Put down the crack pipe and broaden you cinematic horizons! 8.5, my ass! I love TCM and Fathom events and love them even more for bringing movie classics back to the BIG screen on a monthly basis. I saw 'Casablanca' today for it's 75th anniversary. A truly awesome cinematic experience. Hollywood during it's early glory days, firing on all cylinders. Bogie and Bergman at their best and in their prime (You can see why they were friggin' stars!). The incredible cast, writing, direction and onslaught of memorable and most quoted lines...All there, where it should be, on the big screen and with an audience I urge anyone who loves movies to start going to these classic screening and see what real movies were all about!!! 'Here's looking at you, kid'... This is unarguably a 10!!!",10,9,12,15 November 2017
Pacific Rim," Mediocre all the way!
","Just got back from seeing 'Pacific Rim' and my worst fears about this movie have come to fruition! I was disappointed and underwhelmed! I wanted to like it, I really did and I really tried, but in the end I thought it was an O.K. movie that should have been and could have been great. While a cool concept and story, I thought the script was incredibly derivative and saw everything and every cliché coming a mile away. To me, the films biggest sins though are: THE MONSTERS – I thought the designs were bland, unimaginative, uninteresting and unmemorable. Can't remember what they looked like after I left the theater. THE ACTION – Every piece of action in this movie was shot and edited horribly! Horrendous stuffUnforgivable! More weasel on acid cam, more editing by a meth addict on speed, everything I have come to expect, hate and dread in the movies of the last 10 years. To spend most of your budget on special effects and not let your audience get a good look at things is wasteful and frustrating! You could have shot robot puppets on strings, whip panned all over the place and cut it like a coke fiend and saved 99 million bucks! I think that 'Robot Jox' (Which was made for around 140 million less), was a much better and enjoyable giant robot flick, where you actually get to see what is going on!. I think I'll watch it tonight to get the bad taste of 'Pacific Rim Job' out of my mouth!",5,6,12,22 July 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Best of the Marvel Universe
","I'll make this short and sweet....What a rancid piece of baboon sh*t!...just kidding! Actually, I consider this one of, if not the best film in the 'Marvel universe' series! It also has, IMHO, the best super battle ever put on film, digital, whatever! Everything is here and it is a fan boy's wet dream and it is done so well. The filmmakers get it! My biggest issue is that there is way, WAY too much shaky cam during some of the fight scenes (Especially the action scene that opens the film). To get everything else so right and just not lock the f*cking camera down, so we can see and savor the action is frustrating. Thank Odin, they kept it to a minimum during THE epic super battle! Shaky cam just needs to be banned altogether. Period!!!!!! Anyway, it's great, it kick's ass and there is even a very poignant Agent Carter scene. Stay for all of the credits, cause there are 2 Easter egg scenes. Can't wait for more! PS - Tom Holland IS Spiderman and he rocks in this movie...Although I do have an ingrained vision in my head of what 'Aunt May' should look like...And it doesn't look",9,3,8,7 May 2016
Avengers: Endgame," A worthy finale to the Marvel Universe movie series
","Just got back from a matinee of 'Avengers: Endgame'(2019). In short, a spectacular, satisfying and enjoyable finale to the Marvel Universe movie series. They hit so many 'right' notes and gave the characters their respect and moments and manage to fit in so much material coherently in one movie. Without giving anything away, the final scene is just so right and the whipped cream and sprinkles on the sundae.
My only real gripe? (drum roll), some of the action. That hyper-shot, dizzying camera moves and hyper editing style that I've come to despise in the last 20 years. A big screen Xbox game with a 6 year old at the control, who has ADD! I think some of the action in other Marvel Universe movies was shot and edited better.
Having said that, this entry is right at the top of the summit of the super hero genre and should make a quadrillion dollars at the box office.",9,1,6,9 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," 00 Crap
","This entry into the franchise easily makes my list as the worsts James Bond film ever! Nothing here works as a Bond film. It is dark, depressing, humorless and has no sense of fun. Even more serious 007 films like 'Dr No' and 'From Russia With Love' had a sense of fun and adventure and that is all missing here! Even weaker entries like 'A View To A Kill' had a likeable, fun quality. Good luck finding it in this celluloid mess! And that weasel on speed editing!!!!!",2,3,4,4 October 2019
Batman Begins," Pretty Damn Good...Except
",The best vision of Batman on film to date. A pretty damned good film on most levels except for: 1) Did not like Katie Holmes or her character AT ALL!!! 2) Some really good stuntwork...A kick ass car chase and some really badly shot and edited fight scenes (A common problem with many movies these days). ALL DIRECTORS & EDITORS take a long hard look at the fights in 'Ong Bak' and the Spidey/Doc Ock fight in 'Spiderman 2'. Jesus Tap Dancing Christ people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3) Liked Batman's costume but was underwhelmed by the cowl!!! Sometimes it looked OK and other times it looked downright goofey!!! The film is a great first step and light years ahead of the last 2 Gay-O-Rama Bat-Films!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,9,0,0,17 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Not the war I wanted
","I actually liked the film to a degree, despite the annoying kids and several other points that were brought up. My biggest issues was just that this WAS NOT the 'War Of The Worlds' I was waiting for or wanted to see! I hope down the road, they will do one closer to the 1953 version. Pet peeves'1 - Annoying son...Very annoying screaming daughter 2- All electric went out during first attack, yet guy's video camera was working 3 - I thought Morgan Freeman was wrong for the narrator, too casual. I thought Anthony Hopkins or James Earl Jones should have done it. 4 - I didn't like the casting of Cruise. I think they should have gone with an unknown or a not too obvious star. More of an ordinary every man. 5 - Didn't like that you really never see the military engage the Martians in an all out battle or get a sense of what carnage is going on around the world. 8- I just get sick of that chaotic, dysfunctional, yet fun, view of what middle class life is supposed to be like. 9- I wasn't crazy about the way the film was photographed...The very contrasty, muted color palatte just didn't work for me.",7,0,1,20 October 2013
Wonder Woman," Gadot is a 10, the movie is a 7
","Just got in from 'Wonder Woman'. some random thoughts...I liked it, but I didn't love it. I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't think it was great. It didn't 'Wow' me...I would however,recommend it and give it a thumbs up...I know some will disagree with me.I think the two best things about the film were: 1 - Gal Gadot nailed it as Wonder Woman. Fine acting, fine look and fine physicality (When it's not a CGI Wonder Woman leaping around). She was clearly the best thing in that Superman/Batman train wreck movie and pretty much carries this movie and franchise squarely on her shoulders. 2 - All of the scenes featuring Diana's naive and humorous interactions with the civilized world. Welcome light moments in the very dark DC movie universe.I also like the vibe that they really tried to make a good Wonder Woman movie and not hack out the same old usual dreck (And succeeded most of the time).What I didn't like... - I liked the parts better than the sum of the whole (The same way I feel about movies like 'Remo Williams')...I just really didn't care much about the Ares super villain story line, I was more interested in her dealing with the horrors of WWI. That was a more interesting movie to me. The whole Ares thing just seemed 'standard' and lackluster and the only thing missing was some magic orb!. - While I liked some of the action, I felt that the bad camera work and uber hyper editing during the action scenes, deterred from some solid choreography. When are these people going to learn how to shoot and edit action, so that people can see, comprehend and enjoy it, instead of being visually assaulted!Overall, I liked it, I liked Gadot, it will make many quatloos and the franchise will move forward.. I'm just glad it wasn't a Marvel movie, otherwise Stan Lee would have shown up somewhere as a German soldier or a baggage handler.",8,4,10,3 June 2017
