Changeling," Wonderful again Mr. Eastwood
","Maybe I am suspect because I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood (even being a republican). I would like to know more about the real story and circumstances. Did she find the boy someday? Maybe I missed something but what happened to the boy's father?I was not a fan of Jolie but she really surprised me. Cinematography and the recreation of 1930's LA very well done. Police mistakes and corrupt authorities are still here today, so the subject is very welcomed in election times.For me is a strong candidate to the Oscar. But I'm still against the death penalty.",10,7,14,1 November 2008
