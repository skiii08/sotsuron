The Ring," You have got to be kidding! This was supposed to be scary??
","Following the guidelines, I am warning readers that I may write a 'spoiler' (although, really, there is nothing good to spoil in this movie.  I am curious as to why this movie was named 'The Ring', as there is only one reference to a ring in this movie, and it makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from that, we have a stupid, moronic, nonsensical, wannabe supernatural thriller here, about a horse loving mom who, after her horses commit suicide by drowning themselves, for inexplicable reasons (well, maybe they'd heard going to star in one of the worst supernatural thrillers ever made...), kills the adopted daughter she has always wanted, loved and cherished, again for inexplicable reasons (apart from the fact that psychiatric fees for the strange young girl were apparently too high) by putting a plastic garbage bag over her head and throwing her down a well shaft.  For some reason the little girl survives the 100 foot plunge down the narrow shaft with sharp rocks jutting out from the side, and goes on to live for 7 days.  After her passing, the little girl's ghost apparently decides to manufacture a video tape expressing exactly how dissatisfied it is with this whole situation, and said video tape magically winds up in the VCR of a cheap cabin rental up in the mountains, where partying teenagers watch it, get a threatening phone call after watching it, saying they're all gonna be dead in 7 days, and then all wind up dead.  Nobody seems to care about any of this, except Naomi Watts and the deadbeat father of her child, who, after viewing the video tape only a few times, learn the entire history of the island and the Morgon family after only a couple days.   Their son seems to have a magical gift for talking with the little girl's ghost, but none of this is properly explained.  The thread of continuity (and using that term is a stretch here) holding the plot together is so thin, it is laughable.  Somehow, laughing and supernatural thrillers don't go together, in my book. This flop of a movie belongs at the bottom of a very deep well...",Null,0,0,11 January 2003
