Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious and thought provoking
","What is Borat ? Is it an attempt to defy all the conventions of comedy? Is it a social experiment? Is it a study of American xenophobia? what ever it is, its freakin funny. There are many tearful, cringe worthy laughs in this uniquely hilarious mockumentary but the best ones come from when borat is interviewing the American people . Black urbanites, white suburbanites, feminists ,politicians , southerners , northerners- when they clash with borat , the results are hilarious!The results are also thought provoking.Borats naive , socially backwards attitude allows his interviewees to come out of their shells with their own prejudices: witness the cowboy at the rodeo and the dumbass frat boys. Sacha baron cohen (who carries the film as the titular kazakh) is brilliant here as he does the amazing task of making a fool of himself and others while consistently staying in character- its an amazing display that blows a lot of so called Oscar worthy performances out of the water.Borat is hilarious . Take his advice when he says 'come see my movie film '......",8,0,5,28 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," An entertaining addition to the series that will make you forget how poor MI:2 was....
","MI:3 is a fast paced, entertaining entry to the series that will make you forget just how truly awful mi:2 was for a couple of hours.Under the direction of JJ abrams (who cut his teeth on shows like lost and alias ) The pace is tight, there are plenty of suspense filled set pieces and the level of cool espionage spy stuff is high as well as fun to watch.However while abrams is good at setting an air of suspense and urgency, he is pretty hopeless on the action side of things. The set pieces , one of which features a bridge being blown up by a fighter jet, are supposed to be huge and epic but are poorly shot and over-edited - you can only just about comprehend whats going on ! Poorly handled action aside , MI:3 is a solid piece of popcorn fare and if it serves an apology for the atrocious MI:2 then apology accepted !",6,2,3,12 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," More swashbuckling thrills with jack sparrow and co.
","Pirates of the Caribbean dead mans chest is an exciting, funny and always eventful swashbuckler that quite rightly earns its reputation as 'the empire strikes back' of the pirates series.The sheer amount of stuff that happens in dead mans chest is astounding-old characters return , new characters are introduced, plot twists kick in, double crosses occur, swords clash , ships explode: its all happening and it all makes the films 150 minute runtime just fly by in a hugely entertaining whirlwind of old school adventure.Following the first films tradition of great special effects , the CGI used to create davey jones and his fascinatingly cool crew of mer-pirates are just astounding.Jones and crew achieve that ever elusive level of realism that most CG creations struggle to reach-kudos to ILM for such a great job.As expected there a cliff hanger at the end of this second chapter and its a damn good one! Bring on 'at worlds end' ......",8,1,3,14 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Thrills and spills aplenty.
","Pirates of the Caribbean is an entertaining and funny swashbuckling adventure that offers old fashioned thrills and spills . And good ones they are too.The story is engaging and the performances are surprisingly good. Johnny depp is mesmerising as the seemingly forever drunk jack sparrow and Geoffry rush makes a great pantomime like villain as captain barbosa.The film has a timeless authentic look,and speaking of visual stuff, the cgi is amazing. In this day and age where cgi is so frequent that we've become a bit demystified to it , the films CG zombie pirates look fantastic.They so look real Its incredible .My only gripe with potc is the surprising lack of black people in the movie.I mean, its called pirates of the Caribbean, not the pirates of europe ,you know? the Caribbean is and was made up of black people and i think that it was wrong to avoid that.Apart from that flaw though , the film is an effortlessly fun and entertaining adventure.Who would of thought that id give a positive review to a movie based on a disneyland ride , eh ?",9,1,3,25 May 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A solid, beautiful looking, adaptation of narnia .Its not without its problems though......
","The chronicles of narnia is a visually stunning and entertaining adaptation of CS lewis's classic but while it is a good film, there's something thats stop it from reaching the 'lord of the rings' heights it aspires to .The problem is the kids: they cant act ! Skandar Keynes and William Moseley in particular-they just cant express the range of emotions that peter and edmund go through , and these characters go through a lot !Since these kids have to carry a large portion of the film even though they're not capable of it , its a bit of a chore watching them .So its a good thing that they are helped out by such a great supporting cast ! Ray winstone and dawn french are brilliant as the beavers and liam neeson is perfect as aslan , but its Tilda Swinton who towers above every one with her effectively creepy performance as the white which .Another good thing is the visuals, narnia has been brought to life beautifully. The animal characters look amazing and realistic while the lush landscapes of the fantasy world look just how you imagined it.Andrew Adamson has made a good film but he could have made a great one and(to quote scooby doo)he would have got a way with it if it wasn't for those meddling kids.Oh and any one who marks this review as 'unhelpful' clearly works for Disney.Or has a thing for animals and young children. :)",7,1,2,15 December 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A pleasant surprise !
","I was getting ready to trash ice age : the melt down. Since the first film was so self contained, there was no real need for a sequel (besides the need for more money ) and this review seemed like a perfect opportunity to chastise the greed of big film studios.Well after watching the film i can report that they'll be no ranting here- Ice age 2 is a pleasantly entertaining and funny film with with some stunning character animation.Much like the original , ice age 2 meanders along a series of set pieces and visual gags and doesn't out stay its welcome. Fan favourite scrat the squirrel returns for more hilarious, futile attempts to get his elusive nut and there are some clever innuendos for grown ups.However while its entertaining, it has the same problems of the original (a: its a bit too safe b: Its very predictable ) with the addition of some new ones- namely the new characters .Not only are the new characters not interesting but the possum brothers both reach a scrappy doo level of annoyance.Ice age : the melt down is a cash in for sure, but its a funny and entertaining one .",6,4,4,29 April 2006
Oldboy," A stylish , gripping , twisted tale of revenge
","Oldboy is a gripping ,terrifying and super stylish head trip of a film that features one of the most shocking and smart plot twists I've ever witnessed.Chan woo park brilliantly drip feeds the audience the ever twisting plot in a mix of stylish visuals and brutal action .Respect is also due to min sik choi for his ballistic performance as psychotic avenger , oh dae su. Despite the amount of people he savagely beats up, You really feel sorry for him as he tries to make his way through his crazy-ass situation.If the revenge movie is a sub genre, then oldboy is amongst the best that that sub genre has to offer.Brilliant.Twisted but brilliant.",10,16,93,8 October 2005
Spider-Man 3," I guess spider-man 2 was a hard act to follow.....
","Though its superior to the likes of X3 and batman and robin , spiderman 3 suffers from the same problem of those films- it tries to encapsulate too many important characters and events from the comics it based on. Seriously, there's too many things happening at once here! You've got the Parker/MJ/Harry love triangle, the introduction of sandman , the introduction of gwen stacey, the introduction of eddie brock , the venom/symbiote saga AND harry loosing his memory. Its too much to fit in one film-the venom story alone is enough to fill a 2 hour movie. Sam raimis film tries to give you as much bang for your buck as possible , but it spreads it self thin by including too many different elements and not fleshing them out enough . As a result, the moments that are supposed to be big and dramatic loose a lot of their impact, villains aren't given enough time to shine and character relationships seem a little hollow- it all feels rushed and insincere.This may sound like a bad review, but its not.Spiderman 3 has good things going for it; the new additions to the cast do great with the material their given and raimi makes sure that there's a welcome dose of humour .But on the whole though its lacking - spiderman 1 and 2 were such brilliant films that seeing a mediocre entry to the series just feels disappointing.Spiderman 3 is watchable , but no way as enjoyable,exciting or as heartfelt as its predecessors. Lets hope spidey 4 gets it right .........",6,0,0,18 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," The best of the resident evil movies.
","The first two resident evil movies weren't the most faithful of game based movies .Resident evil: extinction is no different , but what it lacks in staying true to its source material, it makes up for in being fast and entertaining, if a little superficial. Its by no means perfect- there's more po faced exposition than actual dialogue and despite there being a lot of characters fighting for survival, there's no real character development or any of the sort of drama you'd expect from the scenario this film offers. But then again, maybe asking that of resident evil: extinction is asking for too much. This is this the kind of film where a sexy babe with two blades fights zombies , evil crows and mutant dogs-which is an indication of what you'll get with this.And speaking of sexy babes with blades, millia does her action hero thing brilliantly . As usual she isn't given a huge stretch for her acting muscles, but she kicks ass with conviction - which is a good thing since this film is full of action.And that action is frequent, entertaining and well directed (if a little shaky with the camera work).It doesn't come close to any zombie movie classic i could name, but resident evil: extinction is a competently handled, entertaining and action packed film . Best of the resident evil movies.",6,1,2,24 October 2007
Cloverfield," Watchable, but not as scary or immersive as it could be.
","On paper, cloverfield is a great idea: A giant monster invasion movie shown entirely from the perspective of hand held camera has potential for all sorts of coolness. However, while cloverfeild has some good things going for it, it doesn't quite live up to that potential.The problem with cloverfield is that it feels a little too Hollywood- its supposed to show the action in a documentary style, but thanks to some teen soap style drama and unnecessary character development, that sense of realism and immersion that horror mockumentaries need to evoke to draw you in, isn't always there. Thats not to say that the film is bad- the film is definitely scary in places. There is a serious sense of dread and panic in scenes when the crowds are fleeing from the monster and news footage of monster attacks are chilling and shocking to watch.Cloverfeilds biggest problem is the very thing thats most integral to the movie: the camera. I understand that the bad, sickness inducing, extremely shaky camera work is supposed to add to the realism but it makes the film difficult and at times, frustrating to watch. Even the micro budget Blair witch project had better and more realistic camera work and that film didn't have a CG monster to show off.Cloverfield is a unique take on the 'monster attacks new york' theme that the American remake of godzilla tried to do 10 years ago and its good for a few scares, but its not as as effective as it should be.",5,1,2,23 February 2008
Silent Hill," When its being creepy, its fantastic....
","I'm gonna sound like an short attention spanned teen by saying this , but silent hill is only really enjoyable when it cuts to the action-stuff like weird mutant babies gallvanting around, a monster with a pyramid for a face freakishly stalking our shreeking heroes and when hordes of satanic bugs swarm the place: When things get creepy in silent hill- thats when things are interesting.When characters are talking however, things become dull. Christopher gans has succeeded in delivering an incredibly disrturbing looking film with an unnerving atomstphere and beautifully nightmarish set pieces but when it comes to making the characters interesting and the acting decent he falls short-the frights and the creepy creatures is where you'll get your enjoyment with this game adaptation.Great when its trying to scare you, but dull in other departments, silent hill is worth a watch .",6,0,2,24 April 2006
Ratatouille," Truly brilliant.
","Ratatouille is an absolute treat of a movie. Its a well written , consistently entertaining and visually stunning film that effortlessly ranks as one of the best of 2007.The films story, in which a sewer rat dreams of becoming a chef, sounds pretty dubious on paper but thanks to a sharp witted script, excellent voice acting (particularly from o'toole) and that indescribable sprinkle of pixar magic , ratatouille transcends its odd synopsis and emerges as a wondrous film that you will want to watch over and over again.As to be expected, the film looks gorgeous. From the ultra realistic food and wet rat hair to the beautiful shots of Paris, every frame of the film is a stunning sight to behold. The film is also very funny- the humour consists of well timed , witty ,character driven and sight gags that will have you laughing out loud.Ratatouille is a classic. Do yourself a favour and go see it.",10,2,5,30 October 2007
Die Hard 2," How the mighty have fallen.
","After the sheer excitement of die-hard , die hard two with its 'so what' plot and 'meh' action is just a big let down. Bruce willis makes john mcclane as likable as ever but the whole thing is just a boring by the numbers affair, which is surprising when you consider how revolutionary the first one was . In fact die hard 2 feels like one of the poor imitators that die hard inspired.The only bit worth mentioning was the bit with exploding plane and the ejector seat but thats as far as your excitement goes with this one .Thankfully, part 3 will totally erase your memories of this bland sequel . Watch that instead .",2,8,19,22 April 2005
Ghost Rider," Ghostrider is the best thing in it.
","Ghostrider is a brilliantly designed character . The chain ,the bike , the flaming skull for a head -he's just plain cool. In fact hes TOO cool - it seems that in any comic , cartoon or game hes involved with, he always comes out as the most interesting thing.It works the same way with the movie: seeing ghost rider in action provides almost all of the films entertainment value. Watching him ride down buildings , fight villains and flip the bird to the police is a cool sight to behold. When hes not on screen though ,things aren't that interesting. Nicholas cage is funny and quirky as johnny blaze and eva mendes is impossibly sexy (as per usual)but for the most part its all very cheesy and feels rushed and episodic.Also, the villains are frustratingly lame , including black heart who's severely downgraded from his comic book incarnation.When sitting through ghostrider , your best bet is to wait for the flaming skullhead to show up- watching him do his thing is tons of fun. Sadly the same cant be said about the rest of the movie.While its not bad it doesn't quite do ghostrider justice . Why ? Because hes TOO cool..........",6,119,188,3 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," So many characters, so little time....
","If x-men : the last stand was a burger, It would be the kind thats packed with too many ingredients and falls to pieces when you pick it up, leaving you with little satisfaction.Okay, so thats not the best comparative metaphor ever , but my point still stands - X men: the last stand crams way too much stuff into its insufficient running time .The film is just an overload of comic book craziness and never gets a chance to breath and revel in the drama or the danger or the tragedy of the plot . The films overstuffing affects the new heroes and villains pretty badly - here we have a group of characters with years and years of comics history behind them and what do they do in their movie debut ? Not much. Juggernaut ,callisto, beast and angel to name a few, turn up, do their little bit and disappear into the crowd again . Its pretty frustrating to watch and shows how overloaded this film is . It not a total failure though. Lack of emotional depth aside, when the Saturday morning cartoon style battles take place, they are fun to watch .Performance wise , Ian mckellan , Patrick stewart and kelsey grammar add great dramatic depth to their roles and i must admit to getting a little geekish thrill at seeing so many mutants on screen at once. X men the last stand is competently handled but is far from the dramatic epic its very clearly supposed to be. Lets hope part 4 will get it right.....",5,2,4,27 May 2006
I Am Legend," An engrossing and scary post apocalyptic thriller.
","To be honest, i wasn't looking forward to I Am Legend. It seemed as if a film that portrays Will Smith as the last man on earth could only be one of two things: 1. A post apocalyptic ego-fest, like Kevin Costners The Postman, or 2. A cross between Mad Max and the fresh prince.Thankfully, it turns out that the film is neither of these things- what it is in fact is an engrossing, tense and satisfying thriller.As the lone human survivor of a plague that has reduced new york to deserted ghost town, Will Smith does an excellent job of holding the film together with a world weary, vulnerable performance that really makes you feel for his character. Large moments of the film is just him and his dog going through their daily routines and it makes for gripping viewing.As for Smiths mutant costars, they are creepy freaks that do their job in the scare department but visually, they're kind of bland. Design wise, we've seen creatures like them before, particularly in Blade 2, and in many shots they look too much like CGI. The same goes for many of the animals that show up in the film (apart from smiths beloved doggy)- they are very obviously fake and its distracting in moments that are meant to be scary.Some ropey CGI isn't enough to bring down the rest of the film though- I Am legend is a darn good post-apocalyptic thriller carried on the very capable shoulders of its star.",8,1,3,24 February 2008
Transformers," Watchable , but not without its problems....
","Transformers is a mixed bag. For every great moment, there's something corny and annoying to counteract it, resulting in a patchy viewing experience that's watchable but filled with flaws that stop the film from being first rate.The transformers themselves look amazing; they are well realised visual effects that are stunning to watch. But whenever they're not on screen (which, sadly, is often) you have to sit through a holey plot that focuses on tons of one dimensional soldier and geeky hacker characters who do not need to be there. The only interesting human characters are the witwicky family who are a likable, quirky bunch .If the transformers and the witwickys were the main focus of the movie then things would be a lot easier on the attention span .What's great about the film is its sense of humour, the jokes are well timed and hit their mark perfectly (although some of the humour is unintentional).Even the autobots are in on the chuckles (look out for what bumble bee does to john tutorro) .Surprisingly, things are a bit disappointing on the action side of things. Sure, there are huge action sequences but they are so poorly shot and edited that you'll have to squint to see them . You'd think that Michael bay would want the audience to have a clear uninterrupted view of the millions of dollars worth of robot action on screen , but puzzlingly he does the exact opposite and decides to shoot almost every action sequence with violently shaky, amateurish camera work. Not recommended for anyone with motion sickness......Transformers is filled with annoying and unnecessary bits but it's a watchable film with great visual effects and a welcome sense of humour.",5,0,2,2 August 2007
The Dark Knight," Good, but its no Batman and Robin. ......no, I'm lying, its brilliant.
","I wasn't a fan of batman begins- i didn't see much point in a 2 hour retread of an origin story we've already seen in comics, cartoons, trading cards, video games, children's books and the backs of action figure boxes. What i did like about it though, is that it put the series in the right direction -and that direction leads to the dark knight.The dark knight is the most emotionally involving, suspenseful, exciting and captivating batman film to date. Its a well acted thriller with a overwhelming sense of scale and importance and thanks to a well written script, it will leave you guessing as to what shocks and surprises are coming up next.What i love about the dark knight is how everything escalates. As the film progresses, the challenges get bigger, the 'holy crap' moments get more extreme, the plot twists get more surprising- it really is brilliantly crafted stuff, its one of those rare films that just gets better and better and better as it goes on.As previously mentioned, the film is well acted. Christian Bale once again proves to be the best live action batman,and there's solid supporting performances (including Aaron Eckhart's great, menacing turn as two face) all round but the star of the show is Heath ledgers Joker. And no, this isn't another one of those forced, positive reviews that over zealous fans give out in light of ledgers unfortunate death- I'm serious when i say that heath ledgers joker is fantastic. What he lacks in the sort of manic craziness present in the previous joker performances, he makes up for in this subtle, brooding, creepiness that just commands your attention when ever he's on screen.So what will the next batman film be like? At the time of writing I'm unsure but if its anything like the 152 minutes of greatness on display in the dark knight, then I'm first in line.",10,1,4,26 July 2008
Die Hard," Excellent.
","Die hard is one of the best action films of the 80s ! Its tagline of 'Suspense, Excitement, Adventure, On every level!' was probably the most fitting ever and it single handedly spawned the whole lone-guy-trapped-in-an-enclosed-place-and-surrounded-by terrorists action sub-genre that we wouldn't have speed, underseige , or to a lesser extent high risk without !Bruce willis is at his best as gun toting every man john mcclane and alan rickman just about steals the show as uber terrorist hans grueber. In addition to the great performances , there is , of course, tons of spine tingling suspense and all guns blazing action.Its a classic of the genre and makes you weary of Christmas parties in big buildings......",10,6,9,22 April 2005
War of the Worlds," HG Wells classic gets the Spielberg treatment . And its Scary !
","War of the worlds is a grim, doom laden thrill ride in which Spielberg uses his usual directorial showmanship to give us his interpretation of HG wells alien invasion story. And its a scary interpretation indeed !Tom cruise is great as flawed father ray ferrier, desperately trying to get his kids to safety but its pre teen wonderkid dakota fanning who walks away with the best performance title in this show.The way she shrieks, freaks out and blubs is so real that you really feel the need to give her a big hug and go 'shh shhh shh shh, its okay ! here have a pudding pop...' The set pieces featuring alien war machines stomping through cities and obliterating everything are astonishing and terrifying spectacles but ironically the the most chilling scenes features the general public going berserk in an attempt to escape the alien invaders .The only problems with this war of the worlds is the same problem that plagues Spielberg's other works- his penchant for sappy sentimentality .It creeps up in moments that i wont go into in order for this review to remain spoiler free, and it distracts form an other wise excellent film.All in all though, its great stuff that makes you realise how how good HG wells and Spielberg are at scaring people.",8,0,1,15 July 2005
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Hugely exciting. A return to form for the die hard series
","Now THIS is how its supposed to be done ! After the disappointment that was die-hard 2 Die hard 3 just kicks the excitement , action , suspense and hard boiled dialog into over drive in this exciting adrenaline pumping sequel.Samuel l jackson shines as mclanes unwilling partner ( 'I NEED TO USE THE PHONE !!!') and the explosions and high octane action are pleasingly plentiful. I think the ending was a tad disappointing after how fast and furious the rest of the movie was , but its no biggie.This is just as good as the first one and if die hard 4 is as good as this then i will be first in line . fantastic .",10,1,1,22 April 2005
Iron Man," Now THIS is how you start a movie franchise.
","In the last couple of years, comic book based super hero movies have had a mission to accomplish and thats kick starting a franchise.The likes of Fantastic four, batman begins, daredevil and hulk to name a few, were made to be the start of a series. Iron man is no different, but where many of these sorts of films fail, Iron Man succeeds because it not only gets the series started but its a damn good film in its own right.Exciting, funny and well acted, iron man is an all round great effort that sticks surprisingly close to its source material. The high octane sequences where iron man soars through the air and kicks bad guys asses are awesome to watch but thankfully this is a film where things are just as interesting to watch when no one is blowing anything up and its all thanks to the Jon Favreau careful direction. The plot, in which billionaire tony starks turns from brash playboy to amour clad hero, is engaging and enthralling and favreaus eye for great acting ensures some great naturalistic performances.There are two stand out performances, the first and most important being Robert Downey Juniour as Tony Stark. Junior makes this role his own, injecting Tony Stark with a sense of cool, arrogance and an Errol Flynn like swagger that makes him really fun to watch and get behind as a leading man. The second (which surprisingly doesn't get as much praise as Downeys stark) is Jeff Bridges as bad guy Obadiah Stane. Although he could have played the role as a scenery chewing , typical villain, Bridges injects the role with a sense of realism and imposing menace, making for a convincing antagonist.Iron Man is what a marvel comic book movie should be- a mix of great story ,exciting action, and a faithful representation of a classic character.",9,11,16,8 July 2008
Signs," Nail biting thrills.
","As far as I'm concerned, this is m night shyamalans best work .Huge plot inconsistencies aside (which i cant reveal without giving a lot of the movie away), Its a scary, suspenseful and gripping sci fi that keeps you guessing until the nerve jangling climax.The performances particularly from Gibson and pheonix are excellent and even shyamalan who directs with his usual mysterious flair puts in a strong cameo appearance .There's even a subtle moral message about having faith and how it can help you in the worst circumstances.Signs is a superior ,well acted ,edge of your seat thriller full of excellently orchestrated nail biting moments.",9,0,2,4 June 2005
300," Stylish . Entertaining . Brutal.
","300 is a visceral ,wonderfully over the top and stylish slice of comic book action.What i found surprising about zack snyders film is how simple it is. While many ancient Greek epics are big sprawling historical soap operas, 300 is a straight forward showcase of the spartans doing what they do best : war. And its an entertaining showcase. The stylishly edited battles are frequent and exciting spectacles that just get more crazy and extravagant as the film noisily marches onwards.Visually, 300 a sight to behold. With the aid of its CG imagery , we are consistently bombarded with memorable, powerful and shocking images : Spartan kids beating the crap out of each other, deformed wenches having orgies and persian soldiers falling from a cliff top are just a few of the crazy sights on display.Its like a comic book come to life - which is clearly what the films makers intended it to be. Because of the plunder-happy nature of the characters , you may have a problem finding anyone to root for, but having a character to relate and latch on to isn't what this is about .300 is about larger than life ,musclebound warriors engaging in visually stunning ,massively entertaining battles and it on this level that 300 most definitely delivers !",8,1,11,25 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Fantastic? Not quite......
","The fantastic four is no way as good as it could of been but that isn't the fault of the director as many fanboys seem to think. No, its all down to a poor script . The script just whizzes through everything very superficially like the introductions of the characters ,development of characters and plot development .The script also lacks the sense of urgency of the x-men films and the heart of the spiderman films-it emerges as just another superhero movie with nothing of its own to offer.Its not all bad though, for there are some moments of goodness amongst the superheroic blandness .Tim Storys eye for comedy ensures that there are plenty of laugh out loud moments like the things anti drug message to the kids , and a funny little montage of the fantastic fours day to day home life .In fact i found the humour and all of the jokes more enjoyable than the action sequences which were surprisingly disappointing!Also, with the exception of jesica albas wooden ,pathetic portrayal of sue storm and Julian macmahons lack of megalomaniac power in the role of Dr doom, the performances are pretty strong.Gruffud does well as a shy and retiring reed richard but its chiklis as the thing and evans as the human torch steal the show ! Chris evans has the cocky human torch down a tee and chiklis is brilliant as the self loathing tough guy turned stone.The little back and forths and bouts of bickering they have between each other are very good and overshadow the the sappy sue storm/ reed richard romance subplot.The film ends on a cliff hanger which promises that we are in for a treat with the inevitable sequel, but if its script had more depth and the action was more exciting then we would have been in for a treat the first time round.Oh and hardcore who don't agree can suck a fat one.That is all.",6,1,3,18 August 2005
The Simpsons Movie," The long overdue simpsons movie is a hilarious and witty piece of entertainment
","The simpsons movie is witty,fast paced, touching, hugely entertaining and most importantly: laugh out loud funny.And if your a simpsons fan who's loved every episode , thats all you'll need from it.However if , like me , your an obsessive fan who's noticed a drop in quality on the show from the late nineties onwards you'll see some problems. You'll see that structure wise the movie is basically an extended episode.You'll notice that the villain is a Hank Scorpio rip off. You'll feel that a lot of the plot points and character drama seem all too familiar.But in spite of all this , in spite of being a film based on a show that exhausted its best gags long ago, the simpsons movie is still absolutely hilarious and i take my hat off to the creators for managing to make it so.A simpsons movie in the early nineties (when the show was in its prime) would have been better, but the very , very , very funny one we have here in '07 works just fine. Funny stuff.",8,248,435,25 July 2007
