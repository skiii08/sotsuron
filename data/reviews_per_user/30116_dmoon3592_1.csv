Ford v Ferrari," What a great piece of history
","I simply love this movie, what a great story to be told and Matt Damon and Christian Bale are magnificent in their respective roles as Shelby and Miles. It's one of the greatest moments in racing history and I'm happy it could be shared in this fashion.",10,1,2,26 November 2019
