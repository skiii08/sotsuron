Your Name.," one of my favourite anime movies
","Although a lot of japanese movies and animes have the same plot (going back in time to save someones live ) but still this movie was different in someway ,i would say the movie animation played a huge part in giving it such a high rate, but still there is this one thing that didn't made sense to me which is:( why they insist on remembering the name he could give her his address or something and they always try to remember just the first name which is not going to be that helpful when you are searching for some one) ,but overall it was a great movie and i would be happy to watch it again.",7,0,1,31 October 2018
