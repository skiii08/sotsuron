Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," didn't like it
","Director Guy Ritchie tries to give a new avtar to Sherlock Holmes as befitting the modern era---and totally fails !!No , the time Sherlock Holmes lives in is still the 1890s , but his personality is tried to be changed by the director .Instead of the cool Sherlock Holmes who seemed to be unruffled by any situation and lived a life of calm detachment , we get to see a comedian who is not averse to disguise himself in women's clothes with lipstick and mascara and all---oh i forgot....the situation demanded it..... But why does the director have to invent such a situation at all ??And when the time comes to deal with the villains , this Sherlock Holmes transforms into a action machine that would put a Rambo to shame..... He does somersaults and what not---and the cameraman adds special effects straight from the matrix movie to enhance the action .In fact , all tricks in the book are used to try to make the movie work- --in fact , too many tricks , and what we get too see is a movie where too many things happen too fast . Indeed , the pace of the movie is breathless .But the movie has no seriousness and mocks itself as it moves along , with the caricature of Holmes behaving in a silly manner trying to crack stupid jokes .Only the villain , Holmes' old enemy Professor James Moriarty is dead serious in his acting , and also in his aims . And he aims to start a world war by creating an incident which would put France and Germany at loggerheads with each other . He hopes to reap enormous profits by selling weapons and ammunition to both sides in the conflict . But Holmes , the ever prescient detective , smells the scent of his plan and decides to stop him .But before all that Moriarty tries to kill Holmes friend Watson on his honeymoon ---something that Holmes prevents by singlehandedly fighting the horde of assassins in an superactionpacked sequence. Shades of Arnold Shwarzneggar in Commando ?? Or Sylvestor Stallone in Rambo ?? Naah..... In fact the action is all second rate , and unconvincing .So does Holmes manage to stop a world war from happening ??Don't bother to watch the movie for that..... It isn't worth it .Go and read about world war one and world war two instead . Yeah , those wars did happen anyway . I guess Holmes was either too old or dead by that time and couldn't prevent them.....Verdict---not good.",4,2,4,18 October 2012
Skyfall," this bond movie does not live up to its hype
","Aaah !! To be James Bond....You chase a bad guy up and down an exotic city in the mystical orient ( Istanbul---Constantinople for those waiting to see it liberated from the clutches of the Turks ) first in a car and then on a motorbike making impossible jumps without hitting or killing any living soul........and then the chase continues on a train until you are shot at the hands of a delectable black girl....But lo !! you still survive the shot by falling deep into water , and are saved to end up being caressed tenderly by the loving fingers of a lovely woman in bed.....This whole action sequence is shot beautifully making it one of the best starts to a Bond movie ever---making you ask for more....But the more does not come at all....Instead what you get to see is a plot to expose the identities of all MI6 agents on Youtube metamorphose into a mission to save Bond's boss M from the revenge of an old MI6 agent who is out to settle old scores with her....And what a villain is the old wronged MI6 agent....all blonde and gay....Yes , gay enough to lay his hands on James Bond's muscular thighs stroking them with lust in his eyes....And with this gay villain getting centerstage , the women are sidelined....we don't get to see Bond on top of the delectable black girl at all....and the one he gets to bed is shot dead within a short time....Yeah ,the exotic locations are all there photographed with skill---from the hideous beauty of Shanghai ( hideous because it was built by kicking out 3 million poor people from their homes ) to the modern wonders of Macau.........And so are the high tech bond gadgets like an antique car that fires machine gun fire from hidden guns to a pistol that is coded to James Bond's palm prints....But ultimately it comes down to a showdown with the villain by the use of old shotguns and makeshift bombs in Bond's ancestral home in Scotland with an old geezer as ally....So can James Bond prevent MI6 operatives from being exposed ?? And most importantly , can he save M from being killed ??Go and see the movie for that....But is it worth the watch ?? I think not....For there are too many loose ends---like how does James survive the shot and fall from the train....and how does the villain escape so easily after being caught and held amidst tight security by MI6 ??The one thing that shines is Daniel Craig as James Bond---who is all brawn and muscle and acting performance....But to me at least , it wasn't enough to carry the film entirely on his ( admittedly broad ) shoulders....The action is bunched in at the start and at the end with the middle of the movie showing all talk but no action....Music is decent....But the movie is barely decent....Verdict---just about okay...",5,15,32,3 November 2012
Argo," tremendous
","To be safe in your country , to be home among your own people , to be relaxing and eating and drinking amongst people who love you and respect you and cherish you---I realised the value of that today.....As I walked out of the cinema hall today and I looked around me I said-- -the people around me are MY people and I am safe..........And then my thoughts turned to the poor benighted hostages from the American embassy eking out a horrid existence for months among gun toting guards of the Revolutionary republic of Iran.....The year is 1979 and the ancient land of Persia is in the throes of another revolution in its bloodsoaked history.....Except that the name of the country is now Iran.....but the Shah who named it as Iran is gone.....gone because he was corrupt and a bloodsucker and a murderer and was having too much fun while the population starved...........But above all the Shah is gone because he worshipped that creation of the unbelieving west called secularism and equal rights for women.....And replacing him is the barbarian horde of Ayatollah Khomeni that calls itself the Islamic revolution......And what is the Islamic revolution ???---All gun welding guards everywhere , people being hung from cranes in the capital Tehran , the population invoked into a mass frenzy against suspected traitors to the point that anybody can get shot , bloodthirsty dogs howling for more blood.....And because the Shah has taken refuge in America the howling dogs called revolutionaries have attacked the American embassy and taken the entire staff hostage....But but....six of the staff escape out and flee to the Canadian embassy- --this is the story of their attempted escape from the hell called Islamic republic of Iran.....And the Canadians who take them in take tremendous risk in keeping them as the Americans and their protectors can be found out and shot dead--- literally....The six Americans got to be taken out of Iran pronto !!To take them out is sent CIA agent Tony Mendez ( played by Ben Affleck ).....The plan to take them out is for him to pose as a Canadian film producer producing a film called Argo and take them out as Canadians who are his film crew.....But there is host of complications like---1 ) getting a permission to film a film in Iran itself 2) making the six Americans pose convincingly as a real film crew when they know nothing of film making3 ) staying clear of the watchful eyes of people who suspect them for who they really are 4) clearing airport security manned by the fanatic revolutionary guards who look at everyone with suspicion 5 ) and not getting tired of the posters of Ayatollah Khomeni's scowling face staring at you all the time in the face And due to all this there's tension in the air.....tension in the land.....tension on the sea......tension in the CIA ops room......and finally there is tension in the cinema hall as everyone watches what's going to happen next with bated breath and pin drop silence.....Bingo !! The tension is a sure shot sign that the viewers are hooked on to the film and the director ( its Ben Affleck himself !! ) has hit bullseye !!As if the relive the tension the film shows certain characters cracking some truly wise jokes which keep the film rolling .So does Ben Affleck succeed in taking them out ?? Go and watch the movie for that.....enjoy the tension !! Verdict---its a winner all the way.....",8,2,4,19 October 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," good movie
","Tom cruise is on--as usual--on a mission that looks too impossible to accomplish .A die hard nuclear terrorist has stolen the source codes for Russian nuclear weapons from the Kremlin , and completed a neat job by exploding a part of the Kremlin with bombs . And he intends to send a signal to Russian nuke submarines patrolling the oceans to fire their nukes on to America and start a nuclear war . Tom Cruise has the task to stop him---at all costs....and against all odds , of course.....And this leads to a long chase from Moscow to the sands of Dubai to the dusty streets of our very own Mumbai.....And its all packed with nonstop action---from climbing the world's tallest skyscraper in Dubai using ' sticky ' handgloves to falling down from it using a rope.....and then finding the rope too short to reach the floor Tom wants to reach , making him jump from megaheight to directly inside the building---just accurately enough............And immediately after the jump , an out of breath chase in a sandstorm , while Tom's partners , including a delectable black woman , indulge in shootings galore............And then to Mumbai for the delectable black woman to briefly romance Anil Kapoor , only to almost strangle him in bed---before continuing on the mission of course.....One word about Mumbai and India---the movie thankfully moves away from stereotyped shots of beggars and children shitting on the streets that have marked Hollywood movies from Indiana Jones onwards , and shows the glamorous part of it .The special effects are something to watch , and the action is fastpaced . But some of the stunts are frankly unbelievable . Yeah---unbelievable , mission impossible......you get to see all unbelievable things become believable and impossible missions become possible in this movie......Verdict---good for a one time watch .",6,2,5,18 October 2012
Titanic," review of 3D version of titanic
","There's a place to live and a place to die.....And there's hardly a more luxurious place to live than the Titanic circa 1912.....And there's hardly a more famous and prestigious place to die to like her.....for her sinking is going to make headlines across the world......So why not live and die on the Titanic....For those who don't die there---remember the trenches of the first world war are waiting just 2 years since the sinking of the Titanic.....Trenches giving death in the and mud and the muck.....So I don't envy Jack Dawson.....Yeah ,the same Jack Dawson who wins a ' lucky ' ticket to board the unlucky Titanic in a game of poker.....At least he gets to sail on the high ocean.....Ahh , the ocean and the sea.....The roll of the waves and the sounds of the seagulls and the cool breeze and the surf.....But thats not all he gets.....He gets to stand on the bow of the most expensive ship in the world and shout '' I am the king of the world '' with his arms outstretched......And he gets to save the life of a supremely beautiful girl...........Which leads to dinner invitation to one of the most luxuriously appointed restaurants in the world in company of high society......But is that all.....??No , there's more good luck in store for you if you are Jack Dawson aboard the ' unsinkable ' Titanic.....good luck before the bad luck of dying.....Yes.....for the girl you save needs saving in a lot of other departments as well...........And she turns to who else but Jack Dawson to save her in every way possible.....But above all she turns to him for love..........A love she has not got from her rich but cold and cruel fiancé.........A love which Jack Dawson can give her in bountiful amounts.....So he gets to stand again on the bow of the most superb ship in the world with a most amazingly beautiful girl and stretch her lovely arms and his own and feel the cool ocean breeze rush against his face..... And lo !! The beautiful girl turns her face and kisses him deeply on his lips while they are still on the bow of the ship with arms outstretched- --one of the most romantic moments ever filmed on celluloid.....But it doesn't finish there for the lucky Dawson....The girl takes him to her room and poses for a nude portrait while Dawson tries to paint her naked body with trembling hands.....And then the inevitable happens.....the two yearning bodies meet for making sweat soaked love.....Does it really matter that the girls fiancé takes terrible revenge by getting Dawson arrested ??......For the beautiful girl never leaves him even though the Titanic starts sinking after hitting an iceberg.....and she gets him free.....Yes free to meet their fate together as the ship goes to the bottom of the sea....But only one of them is going to make it alive.....The chivalrous Dawson makes sure that his girl is that one.....But he's more than that---He's large hearted too....And how so ? Well , before he dies he makes her promise that she wont let his death deter her ; that she should live life to the full and make babies---babies he knows she will make with other men.....And his reward for that---She goes on to live life like he told her preserving his memory and adding his surname to her name....She becomes Rose Dawson.....And for that fact alone , I wouldn't mind changing my place with Dawson's even though I might go down with the sinking Titanic.....But if I cant do that , at least I don't mind seeing the movie again after 14 years....And I don't mind the fact that the 3D effects are not good and hardly make an impression.....For the photography just like last time , was great , the sets were amazing , the special effects were scintillating , the music was heart stopping and the acting by all actors was just special.....What else do you need.....Oh need.....I still feel the need to change places with Leonardo Di Caprio and make love to Kate Winslet after painting her nude while her fiancé Billy Zane boils in anger.....But thats not gonna happen is it.....So I will satisfy myself with the thought that I got the chance to see the movie again on big screen in the name of seeing it in 3D.....I sincerely hope that one day a 4D version comes so that I can see it on silver screen again.....Verdict---do I even need to say.....",9,1,2,18 October 2012
In Time," not bad
","Remember the old cliché ??--time is money.Well , Hollywood brings the old cliché to life , literally , in this film.Its about a world where everyone is programmed to die at 25 , and anyone who wants to live longer than that must earn his time .In short time replaces money .A room in a luxury hotel costs you 2 months of your life , a ferrari costs even longer , and so on and so forth .So who can afford to give two months of his life for just a stay in a hotel ??The answer is that the rich do , for they have earnt more time than they could do with....For if you are smart enough , or more correctly mean enough , you can earn plenty of time lasting for millions of years--in effect , making you immortal .And time can be swapped from one person to other by touching each other's hands in the right position....Which means stealing time from a person is easy.....And to prevent precisely this kind of theft are the policemen in a new avtar.....they are called timekeepers , literally.....And they are here to protect the rich--for the mass of common people have no access to large amounts of time , and have a notorious prelidiction for stealing others time....Indeed , to protect the rich from thievery , there are special time zones separating rich people literally having plenty of time on their hands ( i mean literally ) from the poor who have none......the separation is done by heavy barriers......The mass of poor people live in different time zones which are nothing but ghettos for the penniless--or rather the timeless.....And in such a ghetto is born our hero ( Justin Timberlake ) , son of an idealist who gave up his life fighting against such a cruel and unjust system--and Justin is a son who would make his dead father proud , for he is destined to bring the whole edifice down.....But before he brings it down , he gets to romance the oh-too-willing daughter of a finance magnate ( ) , and escape some hair raising situations , and fight some fights......The movie is gripping enough in the first half , but meanders in the second half especially towards the end . But you can watch it for the novel idea of time replacing money .Verdict--just about okay . I would give it 2 and a half stars .",5,1,2,18 October 2012
Inception," Super !!
","According to macmillan English dictionary inception means '' beginning of something '' , but here the word is used to mean something like the rhyming word conception .Just like conception means planting of seed in womans womb ,here inception is taken to mean planting of an idea in someone's brain .........and the idea is planted by going into his dreams.......by dreaming together.Loenardo goes into other people's dreams and finds out their secrets .......but is hired this time for .........inception.......what else..........to plant into the brain of the heir to an energy conglomerate the idea that he must divide it instead of strengthening it after his father's death ,in order for its rivals to survive........the hirers are the rivals ,but of course.........But does inception work ?Leonardo is near perfect for the job as he knows the answer to this very question .........though only he knows that he knows........because he's tried inception on somebody very near and dear to him.........and it worked.................And for this very reason he's not really perfect ........for trying inception led to disastrous effects .........not only on his life ,but also on his mind..........and now those very effects threaten to upset and unsettle his dreams ..........i mean not only when he is actually dreaming as part of his job of sharing dreams with other people , but also his real life dream of getting back to his land to be with his mother-less children..........confusing ??........well ,so is the movie.........confusing and complex both......but what a movie........and as the plot gets more intricate ,and the characters begin to dream ,and dream in those dreams ,so does the action hot up..........as all the laws of physics ,and those of gravity too .......go for a toss ,we get to see breathtaking special effects that light up the screen........... .........and fast-paced action sequences that make you miss your heart beats.......director nolan has pulled of a triumph that outclasses other special effects movies of the year like avtar and 2012 ,which look so so shallow in front of this incredibly cerebral thriller............the ending ,of course is deliberately vague.........to keep discussions rolling ,and tongues wagging long after you have walked out of the big screen cinema.................yeah ,thats where you need to see it .........on the big screen ,with digital sound and all that........shame on those who want to see it on the small screen.........my bet is that it has some awards...................or i will eat my words........",9,5,9,18 October 2012
Taken 2," Decent action
","Constantinople in Turkey.....now Istanbul.....at the crossroads of Europe and Asia.....where the civilized west meets the barbaric east.....And what happens when a man from the civilized west takes the danger of venturing into the barbaric east ?? He's TAKEN....or rather kidnapped by men taking revenge for the well deserved justice he meted out to one of them who was a rapist.....The civilized man taking the risky venture is Liam Neeson.....and the barbarians who are out to seek bloody revenge are Albanian muslims.....Yeah , its nice to see Islam in the movies....but hey , only in the movies.....all stories of mayhem and murder and loot and destruction and kalashnikovs and massacre.....And when these savages come to know Liam has come to Istanbul with his exwife and daughter they jump at the opportunity like a dog to a bone...........And they plan to kill his wife by cutting her up piece by piece and sell his daughter to a whorehouse to be raped again and again by lust crazed men.....Yeah , the men Liam is up against have no honour nor dignity nor respect for rights of women..... All that they see is their ancient call for restoring their honour---by taking an eye for an eye.....But what they don't know is that Liam is too formidable an enemy.....a man who has survived a hundred battles and has an incorrigible taste for winning this one.... And his daughter is not a wimp either....she's ready to help her dad in every situation.....And thus---when two powerful teams meet for confrontation there is bound to be hell raising action..... .....And hell raising action is what I love.....all bullets flying and grenades exploding and jaws getting crunched and cars getting smashed.....all in the shadow of the Aya Sophia mosque which was once Saint Sophia church the largest church in Christiandom.....and also all under the shadow of the flag of Turkey---a republic seemingly powerless to stop all the carnage.....So whose gonna triumph in the end ?? The bloodthirsty barbarians or the civilized ones ?? The people who look at other people's daughters with an evil eye or people whose mundane dreams include their daughters passing a simple car driving test ??Go and watch the movie for that....I wasn't disappointed by the experience....Verdict---Good action .",6,0,0,16 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Good movie
","In the 19th century came the novel ''The woman in white '' and in the twenty first century comes the movie '' The woman in black '' , and predictably its a horror movie---horror movies being the favoured flavour of the 21st century as much as suspense novels were of the 19th......But as if in tribute to '' The woman in white '' , there is a considerable amount of suspense mixed with the horror too......And to lift the lid off the suspense comes the hero---Daniel Radcliffe-- -from London to a small English village , as a representative of a law firm sent to handle the sale of a remote house situated in a marsh .His sheer presence in the village is unwelcome to the villagers , as he discovers.....and his trip to the remote house is even more unwelcome............For the house has been struck by tragedy , as he learns , and anyone who goes into the house is liable to encounter a mysterious woman in black there , who brings revenge-laced tragedy in the village anytime anyone sees her.......Dismissing this stuff as superstition , he goes to the house alone--- only to be confronted by the sight of that very woman , and also a series of mysterious happenings......Now I myself don't believe in ghosts , but I wouldn't dare go to such a remote house alone , and certainly woudn't dare to stay a full night alone there---especially after encountering such dreadful happenings......But nothing's gonna stop our intrepid hero---after he hears every mysterious sound , he actually follows it ; after he sees a terrifying sight or sees a shadow , he lights a candle and goes after it....... What would have left us breaking out in cold sweat actually rouses the curiosity of this young man as he searches the whole house going deeper and deeper into the mystery.............And as strange happenings and piercing sounds emanate in the ghost ridden house , we are left squirming in our seats cursing the hero for having the chutzpah to wander in such a terror inspiring place and increasing our blood pressure , when if confronted with such a situation we would have taken to our heels at the first opportunity.......But our hero's daring does pay off---though at terrifying cost as his sighting of the woman in black sets off more tragedies in the village . But he thinks he discovers a way of ending these tragedies as he gets what the woman in black wants for herself......So does the hero succeed in his self-appointed mission to save the village ?? Go and watch the movie for that---it does give you some real jitters along the way......But the ending is a tragic and a disappointing one---one is left wondering why the woman in black was not less rentless in her pursuit or revenge than she was , and why she was so cruel..... Why didn't she have some more womanly qualities ??---That of mercy , that of forgiveness...... Or maybe that was the mistake of the film's director.....Verdict---inspite of the flaws , its still a good one.....",7,0,1,17 October 2012
The Social Network," good one
","Whether anybody likes it or not ,facebook is the one of the biggest phenomenons of our times ,and anyone who uses the internet , literally lives under the shadow of facebook.This the story of how Mark Zuckerberg founded facebook ,or co-founded it ,as he is forced by a lawsuit to admit. Mark takes the help of friends in harvard to start facebook ,or thefacebook , as it was called at that time , who finance his endeavour . But as happens when huge amounts of money begin to roll in , friendships begin to sour over money, ,relationships begin to break ,and in the end everyone ends up in the courtroom .Which provides the perfect setting for flashbacks , as much of the movie is in flashback mode ,as everyone remembers and recounts in the courtroom as to what part he had in the making of facebook ,the wheelings and dealings ,from their own perspective , of course. There is no action in the movie , so the director had to keep the dialogues crisp ,and fast-paced. This ,the director has succeeded in doing , and thus creating an engaging movie.In this movie , Mark Zuckerberg emerges as a total nerd , somebody who might have made a lot of money , but would be difficult to live with , in real life. The movie starts with him breaking up with his girlfriend , who is fed up with his nerdish ways , and he retaliates by passing insulting comments on her in his blog .However , the movie is made by inputs given by his former friend Eduardo Saverin , who eventually filed a lawsuit on him ,so he is bound to give a negative image of Mark Zuckerberg. Inspite of this , Jesse Eisenberg has given a good portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg ,and his performance is head and shoulder above the others. Justin Timberlake also acts well as Sean Parker ,the hard-partying man who asks Mark to drop the 'the' from thefacebook ,and call it just facebook ,the name we are familiar with today.The story of facebook is not yet over ,so there might be a part two movie when it has evolved ,or moved into a bigger league. If its as good as this one , I'll sure watch it.........",6,0,0,27 October 2012
