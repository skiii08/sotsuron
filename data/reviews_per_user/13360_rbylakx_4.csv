Black Swan," Black Swan- Oscar's for Best Film and Natalie Portman?
","I will not give away any spoilers so as not to possibly ruin the experience for anyone, but I can say that this movie left me shaking when it was over. What did I just see? I know I was caught up and went for the entire ride from the opening scene till the very end. The reaction of the audience was evident as the end credits came. NO ONE left their seats. They sat and applauded loudly the names as they scrolled up, then upon the very last credit on the screen, they applauded loudly again.It's a brilliant piece of film making and story telling and acting. 'Black Swan', as well as 'The King's Speech', will DOMINATE at the 2011 Oscars and Golden Globes and whatever other films awards show there is... AND deservedly so.I am anxious to see the film again right away with friends, but will actually wait to continue to savor the feeling the initial viewing of the film still illicit in me. It was a thrilling time and I am looking forward to seeing just how successful this film will become and what my friends and family will say.",10,227,410,20 November 2010
La La Land," LA LA Land a HOMERUN !!
","Went to see an early screening of LA LA Land knowing NOTHING about this film. It's grand opening of a traffic jammed Los Angeles freeway on a scorching hot day (we've all been there) that leads to a girl singing in her car, to then an amazing choreographed song and dance number with what felt like 100 singers and dancers all performing on this freeway (no CGI), just blew me away. There were MANY times throughout this film where I went, 'How'd they do that?' and 'That was amazing!'No story spoilers, but Ryan Gosling's character of Seb (a musician) and Emma Stone's character of Mia (an actress) were perfect in their roles as starving and striving artists trying to make it in their professions. Regardless of the fact these two soul mates are perfect for each other, the real life struggles of juggling their love for one another and their career dreams hits home in a big way.Major kudos to Whiplash director Damien Chazelle. He has hit another homerun, and had us singing along as we all rounded the bases.",10,7,12,19 November 2016
Rocky," Stallone's best work and an excellent film...
","I don't think the film 'Rocky' is as appreciated in todays society as it is deserved to be. It's an amazing film with a fine story and some amazing characters. The film has been ridiculed and made fun as the years went on, made into a cliche', except by those who remember its purity and substance when it was first released or those movie enthusiasts who appreciate fine theatrical work.Rocky, a down and out boxer from the streets of Philadelphia, surrounded by poverty and scorn, who falls in love with a local girl and finds himself in the fight of his life against the champion of the world. Seems like such a simple premise, yet so much was happening between all it's characters, that the film never got dull or over the top.Stallone out did himself and surprised everyone, him included, when he delivered this outstanding performance. How could you not root for this guy and feel his despair and pain as his life was happening.
His supporting cast was nothing short of excellent. A great mix of very different characters. A drunk, loud, jealous brother. An extremely shy yet very loving woman. An over the top glory hungry champ. An old disgruntled and still living his dream boxing trainer.I don't think people appreciate the very real fact that it only took Stallone a few days to write this script or how he had to fight the studios to let him play the lead. How different this film would have turned out if another actor played the lead. We are more fortunate for it.Will Stallone ever play a finer role than Rocky? Probably not. He was 'Rocky' in every way possible and it was amazing for him to have let us, the viewers, experience that for ourselves.",10,0,0,15 December 2001
Casino Royale," Casino Royale - Awesome!!!
","One word... AMAZING. It is the type of Bond film all Bond fans have been waiting for. No more cute, wink wink, laugh out loud unbelievable moments we've all grown tired of. What Casino Royale did was make a very real film, with real life consequences and added a crap load of action. Awesome!!! Daniel Craig has taken the Bond character and ran away with it. I never saw a more believable Bond character since the early films of Sean Connery. Ian Flemming's intentions and spirit for the story and character was taken into major consideration and the results were nothing but positive.Daniel Craig takes the Bond character to his early days before he is granted the infamous double O status. Casino Royale's Bond is an unrefined, reckless, unpolished, aggressive, injury prone, cold blooded killer. In essence, a raw piece of meat, that as the film goes on and he gains more experience becomes this prime piece of sirloin. All the Bond signatures we've all come to love and expect are not a part of Bond's nature, but gradually falls into place at the right moments through his experiences. The journey it took to get there is the most fun to watch.What makes Bond such a fan favorite in the past was the way the writers and directors romanticized the character. Bond always had the best gadgets (toys), cool clothes, money, he traveled, women galore, he was smooth, he could fight and play a mean game of cards. Who wouldn't want to be him? Casino Royale took it one step further and said, 'What kind of man emotionally would it take to be a double O agent and what are the dangers involved in such an exciting career?' Casino Royale's Bond is bruised, bloodied, beaten, stabbed, poisoned and tortured in several occasions. He walks around half the film covered in scabs and scars. He is detached from his feelings and makes a clear statement how he prefers married women because it is less complicated. With no family and friends, he truly is a man alone with nothing to live for, which makes him the perfect candidate for a double O agent.I have not given away too much of the plot, for it is better for all Bond fans to see Casino Royale and experience it for one's self. It's one of the best Bond film to come out in decades and ranks in my top 2 or 3 of James Bond films of all time.A quick note... it is important to remember that this story is supposed to be about Bond before he become the James Bond we all know and love. It's his first time being a double O agent. This is why the writers took liberties with the opening gun barrel scene, the vodka martini, the Aston Martin, and the infamous 'Bond, James Bond'. I found it a great choice to a very old and established character. We get to see how Bond becomes Bond. Think 'Batman Begins', which was another great film.",10,55,102,13 November 2006
