Iron Man 3," this movie is suicidal
","this movie is really bad they completely screwed up the Mandarin and made him this f*cked up thing that he really shouldn't be, the enemies are completely ridiculous, the film is full of plot holes, and at the end when he loses his shrapnel, that was just a big disappointment to finish it all off, i hated this film and i think that they should stop making iron man films now because otherwise they are going to make things worse and if they replace Robert downy Jr then that would just finish it off for me, i would probably kill my self. also at the end of the film e has way too many suits and they are way to advanced, if they did another iron man film after this tony would probably just be able to stay at home and watch as he kills all of the villains from his home without even leaving. also i think i wasn't watching iron man 3 just man 3 because he didn't even have his suit for most of it,and when he finally has his suit and has an action suit you find out he isn't even in the suit",1,15,34,27 April 2013
