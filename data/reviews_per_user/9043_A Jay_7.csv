The Blair Witch Project," Just Horrid (I don't mean in a good way)
","What a Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, Terrible film. A pointless waste of celluloid. I have seen some bad films in my time but this just about took the p**s. I had listened to all the hype that surrounded the film and fell into the trap of paying Â£5 to go into the cinema and be bored senseless for however long I had to suffer (I lost interest after about half and hour) This film in no way is scary, a few sticks and piece of marshmallow is not pants wettingingly horrible. I sat through the whole film expecting a scary bit. I even tried to 'let the fear wash over me' what a laugh. This isn't even so bad it's good.Blair witch makes a joke of good horror films that have been made without having to use expensive special effects. The only people who deserve a prize for this are the marketing people who had us believe that this is the best film ever.The characters were horrible and seemed to say the F word in every sentence. After they got into the woods I wanted them all killed by the witch. I hated everything about them, nothing endeared them to me, not even when a 20 foot snotty nose reared up in front of me.
Spoilers belowNow to the last 10 minutes, after one of them was dead ( who knows, who cares)The remaining two found a house and after a lot of shouting find a person standing in the basement then the camera falls over.Never in my life have I seen a cinema full of such puzzled and disappointed faces.End of spoilersDon't even bother wasting  money on renting this you will only heart broken.If I could I wouldn't even give this 1/10",1,9,16,27 October 2001
Finding Nemo," Fantastic
","Quite why I haven't commented on this before is beyond me, but still, here I amPut simply, Finding Nemo is a brilliant film with funny and endearing characters that are a joy to watch. Pixar have again pushed the boundaries of computer animation to bring us a realistic yet still cartoonish film that will appeal to anyone from 3 to 103. I'm sure most people's favourite bit was the whale speak by Dory, which had me in stitches. However other little incidents in the film really made me laugh so much. When the little baby fish falls off the sponge bed is so typical of how children react when they hurt themselves. The animators and writers at Pixar really know how to capture the way people react to situations. All the little facial expressions throughout the film are beautifully animated.The water effects must have been tremendously difficult to achieve, but they are fantastic. The lighting changes that were required really help set the mood of a scene, even when Marlin and Dory were inside the whale. The story although basic was successfully pulled off with no dip in any of the action. The story kept going when it shifted between Marlin's desperate attempt to locate his son, and Nemo's dispair of being alone with no one to look after him except the new collection of strange friends in the dentist fish tank.
Overall I give it 10/10 because it was great. I can't wait for The Incredibles next year, I'm sure it will be just as good.",10,1,2,10 December 2003
The Others," Fantastic
","What a brilliant film. I was impressed from beginning to end. All the characters built up the suspense brilliantly, with their constant shifts from hateable to likeable or vice versa. I didn't think any of the characters were out of place. All of them fitted into the plot perfectly. Nicole Kidman is a very under rated actress. Her performance as Grace was wonderful and she bought out the whole atmosphere of the film. I don't just want to praise Nicole though, the child actors gave a solid performance that was believable and spine chilling.  Every other actor involved was very convincing and Eric Sykes was an unexpected bonus to the cast list. The film itself is well written and beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar. The story is interesting and the 1945 setting is an interesting choice. It will make you jump a few times, but along with the rest of the audience you'll nervously laugh it off. A fact I noticed was that there was barely any special effects. Frankly the film would have been ruined if special effects had been put in.I respect a film that relies mostly on acting ability and plot to build up atmosphere and horror rather than having someone hack a limb off someone else just to frighten you.Possible spoilers below I won't give away to much of the ending (because I hate people who do) apart from to say it is unexpected and leaves you guessing right up until the final 5 minutes. End of spoilers Finally just to say If you're hesitating about going to see it go and see it anyway you'll probably love it. 8/10",9,0,0,4 November 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," I'm sorry, but what the hell was this?
","Thank god the series ends with this. This really was a bad film, I've only been generous enough to have given it 2 because the action sequences were fairly good to watch. The special effects were also as impressive as ever, but the religious symbolism and palaverous dialogue were both pointless and unnecessary. I liked the first film, and quite why I actually chose to see this after the flop that was the second film is beyond me. I guess idol curiosity as to how it would all end got the better of me, and boy was I disappointed when I found out. I won't give away the ending, but I'm sure most of you will figure out what will happen because it is unbelievably cliched.All in all I beg the Wachowski brothers not to prevail upon any more matrix Sequels and make something good instead.",2,0,0,5 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Can't get much better than this
","This is a masterful film. Superbly acted, wonderfully directed and expertly rolled together in an all action romp with a sword. From the opening scene I knew I was going to love this film. Uma Thurman gives a totally believable performance as the bride so mercilessly tortured by Bill and his D.I.V.A.SThe basic premise is that the Bride on her wedding day was brutally attacked by the gang she left when she wanted to get married and have a baby. Because the attack was so violent the bride remains in a coma for 4 years. When she wakes up, she discovers her baby gone and goes on a brutal killing spree against the people responsible for the attack. In this film, Vernita Green a respectable housewife now and O-Ren Ishii, head of the Japanese mafia. The Venita Green fight is short and violent, but none the less satisfying. It introduces us to the situation and leads happily on to the main part of the film, which actually takes place before the brides attack on Vernita Green. It is the tracking down of O-Ren Ishii. Her backstory is cleverly told through Japanese style animation. The whole style of the direction of the latter half of the film is wonderful. The homages to various styles of kung-fu films from the 60's and 70's is a fascinating take on the story and brings a refreshing view to what could have become a very stale and boring story of revenge. the reason why it works so well is that it is taken to a whole new level of clever moments that thrill the audience and kept me captivated for best part of 2 hours. With a film this good, time goes out the window. Yes it is insanely violent in places, but hey this is Tarantino and to have held him back to a PG certificate wouldn't have done the film justice. I couldn't help but give this 10/10 because I loved it, plain and true",10,1,2,19 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Magical from start to finish
","What else can I say but brilliant. True to it's word Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone kept close to the book. Chris Columbus and the rest of the crew clearly listened to JK Rowling when they were making this. Obviously changes had to be made to the story or we could have ended up with a film of more than 3 hours. Nearly every scene was what I pictured it would be. The special effects were fantastic and the game of Quidditch was very spectacular. All the characters fitted effortlessly into the film and every actor was suited to the part they played. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were perfect as are three heroes, but every other actor involved helped to bring the book to life, however brief their appearance.If you haven't read the books then I recommend you do so before or after seeing the film. However the film does speak for itself and people who haven't read this book won't be lost. I won't give away the ending to anyone who doesn't know what happens. Adults and kids alike will enjoy this, I did and I'm not under 12. Overall a wonderfully entertaining film which made me laugh in places and had me leaving the cinema feeling satisfied. 8/10 Role on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",7,0,0,11 November 2001
War of the Worlds," Absolutely stunning
","Not for a while have I seen such a brilliant film. Not only are the visuals perfect the acting is this time top notch. A Spielberg/Cruise pairing is usually a good indication that the film is going to be really good. Minority Report was also fantastic. The premise of the story is that Alien beings have for many years been plotting the total extermination of the human race and one day it happens. It starts off with a simple lightning storm, and what follows is some of the most intense action scenes that I've seen in a 12A/PG-13 rated film. This really is not a film for children though, some of the sequences are quite frankly going to be scary, but for a more mature audience it is a stunning film. The casting is spot on. Tom cruise plays Ray Ferrier, our main hero of the picture and father to Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning). Fanning inparticular is exceptionally good in this, she is one of the best child actors around at the moment. But Cruise and Chatwin also deliver a fine performance as a slightly estranged father and son. A surprise addition to the cast was Tim Robbins who played a not quite all there man trying to come to terms with what is happening around him. As for the visuals they are brilliant. The combination of CG and live action is seamless and the look of the alien vehicles (tripods) are creepy and otherworldly, I was most impressed by them. The fact that the movie only starting shooting 7 months ago does not show in the slightest, the effects are up to standard and beyondIn summary it is a fantastic film, definitely worth a view, but I wouldn't recommend taking your kids with you if they are under 10.",9,3,12,30 June 2005
