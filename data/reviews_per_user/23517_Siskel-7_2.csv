Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The weakest of the series, but still quite well done.
","The Phantom Menace is the weakest of the four Star Wars films, but how could it live up to the hype?  It is not anywhere close to the disappointment other films like Jurassic Park and Godzilla were, but it has its share of problems. Lucas' script is predictable and his dialogue at times is p*** poor.  I have been told that he spent years on the script; other writers have done better with less time.  The script is a bit closer to The Matrix than the brilliant Fifth Element a couple years ago. The most annoying thing is the character of Jar Jar Binks.  He is Lucas' attempt at comic relief, but everytime he spoke I cringed.  I cringed twice as hard when he did something allegedly funny or cute. However, I must credit Lucas' direction.  The visuals are the most outstanding ever.  He keeps the style of the original films, but improves the effects considerably.  This films should be up for sound, sound effects editing, art direction, visual effects, and makeup around Oscar time.  As far as best picture, it does not stand a chance. The acting is alright, with one standout in the ensemble.  This film may be Natalie Portman's big break.  She has delivered stong performances over the years in The Professional, Heat, and Beautiful Girls.  In Portman's hands Queen Amidala outshines, McGregor's Obi-Wan and Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn. She also outshines all the colorful creatures.  This girl has a future, I hope her performance will be taken seriously. The Phantom Menace is not perfection.  I did not expect perfection, but it is quite well done thanks to George Lucas' direction, visual effects, and Natalie Portman's amazingly strong performance.3.5 stars out of 4",7,0,0,19 May 1999
Chicken Run," Great Animation, but Not a Great Children's Film
","Claymation is ImpressiveI'm giving Chicken Run a mild recommendation.  I loved the use of animation that was not computer generated or traditional.  It is nice to see more variety from Disney and Dreamworks as animation seems to be booming once again.  The fact that they had to film this movie one frame at a time while moving clay objects amazes me.  I can almost forgive some of the other problems with this movie. The problems center around the screenplay, by Karey Kirkpatrick, which uses too many subtle references to movies that kids would not recognize.  The Great Escape and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are not films that six years old children will be familiar with.  I personally enjoyed the allusions, but I did not think they were necessary. The writing also lacks the wit of the Toy Story movies or the charm of Babe, which was an obvious inspiration to the filmmakers.  The jokes were much too British for its target audience.  I laughed occasionally, but there were times where the filmmakers were trying for laughs and not getting them. I hope the next claymation production takes as much time with its writing as it did with its amazing animation. Still, as a film lover I have to recommend a movie that is trying to do something unique.  It is worth a matinee admission. 3 stars out of 4",6,0,0,13 July 2000
