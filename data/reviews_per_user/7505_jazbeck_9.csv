Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," this proves that Lucas is in decadence
","If anyone has read any of my comments in Sci-fi, you'll know that I just hate Star Wars (excepting the first one in 1977). This movie proves my theory, this saga is one of those that make up a stupid story, just for let the watcher look at the little details, like monsters, space creatures, star ships, etc. In a very personal opinion, I believe that what makes a movie great, is the fact that it marks a 'before' and an 'after', 'a new hope' did, fut the rest are just movies that you would easily forget, that got famous because of the first one.So, if you love the saga or want your kids to shut, watch it, if you are a real cultured person, you should know what is waiting for you.",1,0,1,25 November 2001
Unbreakable," NOT THE 6th SENSE... BUT STILL GREAT!!
","Some say that the director and writter all ways uses the same formula, but I think that this movie has a the same atmosphere but a very different subject from his first movie. Any way, this film makes me think that super heroes truly exist, that I can be one of them and that bruce willis is my favorite actor.THIS IS THE WAY A SUPER HERO SHOULD BE!",Null,0,0,26 October 2001
Fight Club," CLEVER CINEMATOGRAPHY
","It's incredible that the academy didn't nominate this one for best movie! I my own personal opinion 'fight club' is the second best movie of 1999 (right after 'the matrix'), and it even has a very important message that only a few could understand.This movie shows people what they should do in situations like the ones a month ago (the WTC)... 'everything is going to be fine' that's what Edward Norton's character says when he watches the U.S. economy going down, and I think that's what we should think.Another lesson that I learned with this film, was that we are searching for our enemy in a far place, when maybe, just maybe it's right behind us, maybe is the guy next door (like Tyler). Everyone can be a psycho, that's what I learned.So if you want to take a few life lessons I highly recommend this movie",9,0,1,31 October 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," THIS ONE DIDN'T HAVE ANY 80'S HAIRCUTS
","Although this great movie makes many references to the first terminator, I still believe that this is what the writer got in mind in first place.Also, terminator 2 marks a 'before' and an 'after', I mean, the movies changed since this one appeared, like today, every damn action movie is like a matrix remake. But the best thing i could find in this film was the fact that (if you don't know when it was made) you can't figure the decade of it's release because of the haircuts or the music. I know it because my little cousin (he's 8 years old) thought it was the second part of the matrix... isn't it cool!Well, back to the topic, I highly recommend this movie for the acton fans, the Arnold fans, the Cameron fans, and even the action anti-fans (I started to watch action movies when I saw this one)... IT IS THE BEST OF THE EARLY NINETIES!!",9,1,1,27 November 2001
Pi," A GREAT WAY LO LOVE MATH
","This movie kicks asses!!!, the plot is very, very ,very original, and the performances are absolutely cool, I will never watch the mathematics in the same way again.This movie does not need any explanations, it's one of those films that leave you with a big doubt, but somehow, happy with the conclusion (not like K-PAX). And using all that Jewish math descriptions was a very well planned way to make us watch how they are trying to 'manipulate the world'.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... FILLED WITH CULTURE.",Null,0,1,18 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It's good... but not 'the movie of the decade'
","I did enjoy this movie... I really did, but I feel like everyone else is over rating the film a bit.I mean, although there are many plot holes, It's a good way to spend two hours and a half (almost 3). This proves that It's a well taken story. Because as I noted it has a lot of influence from Star wars and the never ending story, like a combination of both.This is what makes this movie special, the way they took a not very original story and made it a good film. Any way, I must say that liked the film, not loved it; it's one of those movies that you can watch a Sunday afternoon, It didn't improved anything to the movie business in any way, it just broke box office records , but It's good...just...good.So, watch it, if you don't , you are not missing any great thing.",7,0,0,2 December 2001
The Matrix," IT'S LIKE A REALITY COLLAGE... MAYBE USED BEFORE, BUT STILL GREAT.
","This movie is terrific, not only the special effects are cool, but so are the actor's performances and the story.I admit that this is my favorite movie, but I know that some of you IMDb users know that all this stuff has been used before (not much... but it has been used). The real great thing about this movie are not the special effects,neither the story... but the way they used all the elements. They KNEW how to use them, not like DARK CITY or other movies of this kind...
Another thing that bothers me is that people just can't get it... they say the movie is right just because the visual effects or the sound track, but they don't realize that they are watching a great piece of art... made with many different and sometimes 'recycled' elements.We all have seen this story before, but never like this, I mean, there are two other stories to compare this one to:1) Dark City, The 13th floor or other movies.2) Jesus.So, I ultra highly recommend this movie, and also give you a tip:You should watch all the action scenes and kung-fu fights, then watch the hole movie, You'll feel a very different sensation... the first one is like watching a 'star wars movie type' (A lot of action, but no plot) and when you watch the hole thing you'll realize that the influence is so big, that the prove of it are all the 2000's action movies.WATCH IT...IT'S ALMOST THE OBLIGATORY MOVIE FOR THE NEW CENTURY",10,0,0,14 December 2001
The Matrix," My god... my eyes still hurt because of the special effects!
","THIS MOVIE RULES! It's great when you see everyone getting out of the theater thinking if all that they saw was real, not being sure if this world is just a computer generated dream. but I am sure of 3 things: THE MATRIX has a very good story, great characters (specially Agent Smith), and a lot of cool visual effects (the bullet time scared me!) maybe a lot of movie-fans will want to kill me after i write this but... i think THE MATRIX is probably the best successor of the STAR WARS trilogy, after all... the science fiction changes with time.",10,0,1,22 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," a log time ago in a galaxy far far...plug on pal!
","I don't know why everyone loves this stupid movie just for kids, and WHY in God's name is in the first place of ACTION MOVIES and SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES... first of all, a good action movie just can't be rated as 'PG'... and come on! this is the new Millenium! now the science fiction is not just sable lasers,laser guns and all that crap which has the Word 'laser' on it. Today a good science fiction movie has a GOOD plot ('the matrix'), GOOD acting ('the matrix') and something that everyone is related with (please just watch 'the matrix'). I think everyone likes just because it was 'great' in 1977, just because it has 'great' special effects (and it really depended on them for it's success)...Now if you want to see a good Sci-Fi/Action movie watch the matrix, it is not just special effects folks...",1,8,45,21 July 2001
