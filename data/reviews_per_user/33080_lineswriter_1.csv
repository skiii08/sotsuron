The Devil's Advocate," Was Pacino serious? SPOILERS
","I can't believe how bad Pacino's performance is, especially in the climax, which is ten minutes too long and way over-the-mount with the devil's ridiculous, poorly-written ranting. Bluh-bluh-bluh. Not compelling. Uninspired. Boring. I lost track of the dude's point: too much shouting.Reeves: good from the get-go with his dark 'I'm gonna win' sin-grin in the bathroom mirror, which was spookier than all Pacino's subsequent screaming. The accents weren't good, but Charlize and Keanu (and everyone else) make Pacino look like a one-trick-pony trying hard to be scary.Charlize's heartbreaker suicide scene is the scariest, most compelling in the movie. All the performances in it are GREAT.This movie's too long, gives Pacino too many lines, has too much dialogue. Would be a better movie, and LESS preachy, if the reporter at the end had come from up above. Shoulda let me enjoy my character arc for more than two minutes. And shoulda let Reeves and Theron have the last 'word'. This is clearly their movie, not Pacino's.",Null,1,2,10 October 2004
