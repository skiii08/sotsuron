National Treasure: Book of Secrets," So many things wrong here!
","Where to start? Nicolas Cage is not an action hero. He is ugly, he is a bad actor and he doesn't have the physique for the part - he never had. I don't t even think he has proper personal hygiene. He is especially unbelievable as a brainiac and he simply comes off as a wimp. However, he is extremely convincing as an insensitive 'ugly American' who abuses the hospitality of every country he visits. The storyline could have been more interesting than even 'The Da Vinci Code' ... if it made the slightest bit of sense and if the director had not simplified it to its barest, more unsatisfying elements. All it boils down to in the end is a very uninvolving video game, which is the rule of most action pics these days. The hero wants to prove his ancestor is innocent of having conspired against Lincoln's life. That is his primary motivation. Yet, it is never shown how he actually achieves this. The business about the twin desks is full of holes and Helen Mirren's false decoding - under duress - of the second wooden plank just doesn't make sense and is never satisfactorily resolved. The most interested viewers are left dangling left and right and in more dire danger of losing their mind than any of the protagonists tumbling down an underground river. The City of Gold is disappointing and simply unattractive. It actually feels like recycled footage from the first film. And the music score represents the umpteenth rehash of the theme from 'The Madwoman of Chaillot' (penned by Michael J. Lewis, 1968). Oh! And the main character pronounces the word 'repartee' as if it was written 'repartay', which is an infallible proof of ignorance and lack of culture, even in an American. Poor Helen Mirren must have cringed at that one...",3,2,3,29 June 2008
The Young Victoria," Almost perfect...
","This is not a bad film. As a glorified fluff-piece somewhat respectful of historical fact yet conducive to the erotic reveries of well-bred adolescent girls who still believe in Cinderella and Prince Charming, it can't be topped (please see 'user ratings' by age and sex). It boasts art direction that can rival any Vincente Minnelli production and I'm really proud, as a native of Quebec, that this project was helmed by a compatriot, Jean-Marc Vallée ('C.R.A.Z.Y.'), who gave its story-telling fluidity and believability. The only points I subtract are for the decision to eliminate the Lady Flora Hastings subplot, probably because this real story of 'pride and prejudice' (slander against a worthy woman) would have been difficult to justify and integrate into Victoria's proud but saintly persona. I would have liked to be a fly on the wall in the room where the decision was taken, probably for crassly commercial reasons, to sweep the whole downer of an affair under the carpet. Some of that story, however, still makes it into the Deleted Scenes of the DVD. It would ultimately have given the story much more weight and resonance about what people mean when they say 'victorian', especially in a script written by the very thorough, witty and erudite Julian Fellowes, one of the last representatives on this planet of the 'educated scriptwriter' species. It would have shown Sir John as somewhat less of a villain and Victoria as a bigot falling prey to appearances and gossip. The good news is we can still expect even more interesting work from Vallée and Fellowes. P.S.: Prince Albert was never shot or grazed during any assassination attempt on young Queen Victoria, although there were several of those. This can be seen as a necessary concession to the present school of European biopics which doesn't conceive history on film without the spilling of some kind of bodily fluid, usually blood.",8,1,1,26 April 2010
I'm Not There," The Unbearable Heaviness of Boring
","This was an audacious concept. Having Bob Dylan portrayed by half a dozen different actors assuming fictionalized personas. As if the real Bob Dylan wasn't full enough of terminal contradictions. But as the producers of this boring, pretentious mess could only paraphrase and not quote directly from any documented reality (what is reality?) except Dylan's songs, of course, the film looses itself in the meanders of absolute arbitrariness and sundry parallel universes in spite of the best efforts of some worthy actors and talents. I lived through the sixties and Dylan's rise to celebrity and I didn't recognize anything of my perceptions of him in this film, probably because either the film or Dylan himself (who knows, right?) is more preoccupied by the flotsam and jetsam of terminal hype, the fame game and/or celebrity rehab scenarios to actually care what a man's music is supposed to mean (if anything). If you ever saw anything worthy in Dylan's music, you'll think twice about his talent after seeing this film. If you always thought he was a fake and a flake, your opinion will not be seriously challenged by this delirious and wasteful Actors' Studio job-creating program.",5,5,6,25 April 2010
Hostel," The perfect date (rape) film for Bush's America
","So, this is what is to be found at the bottom of the long, slow, slippery slope of America's gradual moral degradation and 'cultural roll in the gutter', from Coppola's first glorification of organized crime, in 'The Godfather' (the 'creed of greed'), to that old reliable sicko Quentin Tarantino's more explicit oeuvre of populist sadistic know-how (the 'culture of torture') Thirty years ago, Hollywood's schlockmeisters started to glorify the creed of greed by which anything can be had for a price, by which the fastest acquisition possible of your neighbour's material goods justifies all moral turpitude before the planet caves in under global warming, from individual get-rich-quick schemes to giant corporate appetites like Enron's to the takeover of entire nations in search of fossil fuels. The soap-opera about the Corleone family now looks like a timid blueprint for the career of George W. Bush. Hollywood then proceeded to desensitize a willing public to violence, death and the dignity of human life, by feeding it a steady diet of round-the-clock mortuary thrills, uncensored slasher films, detailed depictions of sadistic behaviour, TV movies recreating the Bernardo-Homolka murders (over the objections of the victims' families) and other real-life or imagined atrocities, crime scene investigations and sitcoms/dramas/reality shows about the private lives of undertakers, Mafia hit men or serial murder profilers. Finally, American popular cinema now delivers the ultimate goods, films where the viewer becomes the virtual torturer and, if he has any inkling of morality left (hey, it might happen), he will be tortured in return - at least mentally. I don't think there is a more despicable way to make a buck. Do you? But then, what do I know? I'm only Canadian.On the one hand, 'Hostel' cynically plays upon the legitimate fears Americans have about the way they are perceived by the rest of the world and, on the other hand, films like 'Hostel' make those perceptions even more problematic by picturing Americans as a people with a very unhealthy appetite for violent entertainment exclusively concerned with revenge, torture and sadism. And that can't be good...P.S.: Need further proof of America's attitude when it comes to violent entertainment? Count the number of negative reviews on this site who consider this film is not gory or scary enough and who blame the director for not delivering the psychopathic thrills of 'Saw'...",1,1,4,18 January 2006
Alexander," 'Alexander''s dirty little secret
","I watched the theatrical version of this film on DVD last night as I was very curious about all the kerfuffle. As it turns out, even though I am heavily prejudiced against Oliver Stone for the sheer mass of lies contained in his delirious ode to irresponsible homophobia called 'JFK', and for hanging out with and glorifying small-time and big-time real-life homophobic tyrants like Jim Garrison and Fidel Castro, I must say his film of 'Alexander' got most everything right. What nobody will tell you, of course, is that this 'Alexander' is an almost scene-for-scene transposition of Mary Renault's novel 'The Persian Boy' (Alexander's conquests as seen from the eyes of his favourite eunuch, Bagoas). The only thing that's changed is having Ptolemy act as the narrator instead of Bagoas (both dictating in Alexandria many years later). This, shall we say, 'borrowing' of course explains why the film is so gay-positive, which, I suppose, is Mr. Stone's way of atoning for past sins. As luck would have it, Middle America was not ready for such frankness and Mr. Stone now knows what it is to be bad-mouthed for having 'gay sympathies', by which he will probably learn a lesson. Or then again, maybe not, judging from the self-censorship job he pulled on his own 'director's cut' from which every naughty bit was excised. But this does not distract from the fact that 'Alexander' (the theatrical version) is a rather competent film that was obviously misunderstood by a whole bunch of Yahoos and Joe Six-Packs (Stone's regular public) who were lured into theatres to stare at Ms. Jolie's gazongas. And that is very sad for the future of film-making in America.",7,0,2,3 August 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," What they won't tell you, of course, is ...
","PRACTICAL PIECE OF ADVICE: IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO ENJOYED THIS FILM, DON'T LET THEM BABYSIT YOUR KIDS!!!This highly critically praised 'magical fairy-tale' is rated R for a very good reason. In its 120 'enchanting' minutes, I counted no less than 85 homicides, all extremely and graphically violent, many by the most sadistic and revolting means imaginable and all guaranteed to repulse. For good measure, this 'surrealistic escapade into a childhood land of imagination and wonder' also has as many body fluid scenes as any Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel: after the obligatory appetizers of vomit, muck and slime, blood starts pissing from open wounds, a pregnant woman has 'complications', hatred and violence being the prime motivators of all characters, an innocent peasant has his face literally caved in with a wine bottle for no apparent reason in front of his father, who is also killed for no reason, a mandrake root is fed the blood of a little girl, squalor is rampant, there is a completely gratuitous amputation scene (what serious film could be without it?) and an equally gratuitous do-it-yourself plastic surgery scene, scenes of disfigurement, military executions and cold-blooded torture, and, for good measure, even cute little pixies get decapitated along the narrative way. In this sophisticated age, it is assumed sufficient for the viewer to know that this is 'an intriguing film', made by someone from a foreign country and with an imposing-sounding name and that it is 'thought-provoking'. It would be considered in bad taste or simply jejune to mention that this kind of film can seriously harm a child and is certainly warping quite a few adult minds as we speak. Or that it is a seriously depressing and morbid gore-fest from beginning to end and a revolting and cynical misappropriation of the spirit of childhood and poetry by deeply troubled minds working under the banner of lowest-common-denominator CGI-augmented slasher horror and freedom of expression.Everybody in America is falling over each other in praising this film but very few critics have noticed that what makes this film 'the ultimate fantasy film' (i.e. totally cut-off from reality) is not its subject matter but the fact that it is set in Franco's Spain, yet fails to mention the Catholic Church in any way, shape or form (priests, rituals, imagery, symbolism, role in the repression of socialism), a feat comparable to making a film about Iraq that would fail to mention the existence of Muslims. Yet, its moral seems to be that 'there is no greater love than to die for those you love', a Christian principle that is rather irreconciliable with the fantasy universe's pagan philosophy.Although not aimed at children (its violence is much too repulsive for that), this so-called fairy-tale for adults is sufficiently childish on every other level to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It was conceived after all by a filmmaker who specializes in comicbook adaptations - the new 'literature' of dyslexic America. But I am mostly infuriated by the false advertising. This is a gory, harmful, snuff-porn, slasher film masquerading as an art film: Its tagline might as well be 'Hey, guys, it's got subtitles, so you know it's good for you!' The people who are taken in by this trash are mostly young Americans, ignorant about history or the world around them, and who are fans of violent, sadistic cinema. It was conceived by a man with a troubled mind and no interest in reality, whose main obsessions are violent death and dismemberment. It would appeal to a people who has repeatedly failed to count the casualties in a war they have started in Iraq because it is good TV entertainment and good business and it is set in a faraway land they couldn't even pinpoint on a map of the world.Historical footnote: The film also fails as history. Its simplistic Saturday-morning-cartoon fascists-are-bad moral fails to take into account the fact that the most egregious atrocities of the Spanish Civil War were committed by Communists and Socialists, which turned world opinion against their revolution. The pope still has 9,000 Spanish Catholic martyrs on his canonization roster. This film is an insensitive insult to the Spanish people who is still trying to come to terms with that horror in its daily life. Mr. Del Toro should definitely confine his talents to adapting comic books for slow-witted American teenagers.",1,41,94,15 May 2007
Shutter Island," The product of a very sick mind... but still a pretty good film
","Do people still wonder why the Academy of Arts and Sciences hesitates to give an Oscar to Martin Scorsese every time he is nominated? Could it be because of his propensity to use his huge talent for directing and his academic knowledge of cinematic story-telling devices only to gross out his public? I mean, what are his real accomplishments besides upping the violence quotient in every film he makes and telling us that Italians are murderers and Mafiosi with colourful speech patterns and creative ways of killing the people who show them disrespect and even the people they love? Scorsese is like that distant cousin who is uniquely preoccupied with looking up women's skirts and wonders why he never gets a date. Except his particular vice happens to be showing, analyzing and brooding over the myriad facets of the wonderful world of violence and bloodletting, like a creep tearing the wings off flies.In this case, the film is well put together and tells an acceptable story, not without a lot of channeling of Kubrick's 'The Shining'. It has atmosphere in spades and the hurricane scenes are particularly well thought-out. The art direction, acting and cinematography are superb even though the director has once again opted for the extremely clichéed blue-green colour scheme that has become, from sheer banality, the shame of the American cinema of the past 10 years. The script is semi-literate in spite of its numerous anachronisms (to name just three: the use of the phrases 'electronic systems' and 'no problem' and the depiction of an attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation).The music is effective in communicating suspense and terror even though it is an anthology of every piece of modern writing that could never ever please an audience on its own except as an accompaniment to scenes from an insane asylum.Violence is such a powerful force in modern American society that it is indeed a legitimate field of enquiry and exploration. What Mr. Scorsese should ask himself, however, is whether he belongs with the people who are legitimately reflecting on violence or whether, as one of the individuals who have contributed the most to desensitizing the movie-going public to its horror, he is part of the problem.In that sense, the film is indicative of Martin Scorsese's own career: ***SPOILER*** in the end, the patient discovers all the crimes of which he is guilty and understands the measures that must be taken to protect society from his further abuses.I'm not saying that his next project should be a remake of 'Heidi' but it WOULD be therapeutic for him and certainly a step in the right direction.",6,0,2,8 June 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," See it for Emily Blunt!
","I didn't read the novel but I suspect it must have had a little more of a bitchy bite than this film, which has been de-clawed into a fairly generic romantic comedy that is both defective and predictable, instead of the tell-all film-à-clé it should have been. Meryl Streep is at her best and fascinating to watch at all times. Stanley Tucci's part works. As is usual in today's Hollywood, some decent scenes were cut in a last-minute dumbing-down frenzy and found their way on the DVD extras. Everything else (except the fashions) is in the dumps, especially the heroine's love affairs, which are muddled, maudlin and by-the-numbers and soundtracked with debilitating pop tunes. (I didn't think I would survive the scene where Andrea's boyfriend actually sulks because of a missed birthday or the one where an on-the-rebound one-night stand morning after turns into Exposition Device Central.) Anne Hathaway looks at all times like an uncomprehending cross between a young Liza Minnelli-faced puppy and a lobotomized, siliconed and puffy-lipped Audrey Hepburn clone. But the film, by and large, belongs to a British newcomer named Emily Blunt who turns her smallish part into a work of art and whose every reaction, every word and every gesture makes you believe in the contagious toxicity of the world of fashion she has sold her soul to when nothing else can. Oscar, Oscar!!",6,0,0,13 December 2006
Watchmen," 'Do you like snuff-porn movies, Jimmy?'
","Alan Moore had his name removed from this obscene putrescence and it's easy to guess why. Whereas Moore wrote a thoughtful genre piece on what could happen to the US if Republican hawks stayed in power past Vietnam and as a cautionary tale against the coming fascism of Bush and company, the movie version is simply a snuff-porn version of 'The Days of Our Lives' made all the more unwatchable in that it compresses the events of 40 years in a 3 hour movie.I never read Moore's graphic novel out of contempt for American so-called intellectuals who really believe, in their current state of illiteracy, that their best works of fiction can really come from comic-books, even when they are well-intentioned and well thought-out comic-books with pretty pictures. I should have also refused to see another film by the makers of '300'. Their only inspirations are video games, the adolescent revenge scenarios of the WWE, regular pornography, torture pornography, snuff pornography and, of course, comic-book violence. The level of insistent, in-your-face, detailed, lingering as well as explosive, sickeningly 'imaginative' mayhem in this opus makes 'The Dark Knight' look like 'The Adventures of Tintin'. The only factor that contributes to keeping the gag reflex under reasonable control is that the photography is so murky at times as to be almost undecipherable on DVD, even on a state-of-the-art monitor working in full-blown torch mode.The film is also aesthetically and structurally unbalanced. I won't even mention the asinine, cliché-ridden, wince-inducing dialog, which is worthy of a doctoral thesis on the dumbing-down of America or the sleep-inducing blue-green colour scheme, which is the signature of all pretentious failed cinematic masterpieces of the last decade. But the idea of mixing all that shtupping and dismemberment with protest and art songs of the sixties, seventies and eighties is simply revolting. I will never be able to listen to those songs again without feeling something of our collective past has been desecrated forever. The film is composed of two unequal parts: (1) one hour and forty-five minutes of incomprehensible exposition where the spectator is asked to memorize the back-stories, names, surnames, aliases, murderous habits and hidden identities of a dozen or so totally despicable non-entities who don't seem to have any superpowers (except for Dr. Manhattan's freakish nature and the others' ability to kill on demand) and (2) one hour (minus interminable credits) of full-blown but equally incomprehensible and disgustingly as well as gratuitously graphic 'action'. The film's moral is that America has lost its moral compass and its soul. The fact that this film was made at all and that it was a relative success in the US - a success that will probably open the door to even more egregious and grandiose atrocities - is ample proof of that demoralizing fact.P.S.: The saccharine grafted-on ending straight out of 'The Waltons' doesn't help matters much. There is still no one to cheer for and the whodunit taking up two hours of that film is never satisfactorily resolved.",1,15,31,1 August 2009
Cold Mountain," Just what the world needs: Another US war/torture porn epic
","Let's not be too harsh on the novel that inspired this abomination. The result would have been the same if it had been an adaptation of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' in the hands of those filmmakers. Just like the benighted citizens of Ancient Rome amused themselves by watching human beings dismembered for their enjoyment in the arena while the rest of the world burned in a conflagration they had started but didn't know how to stop, today's Americans love nothing more (apparently) than to collectively cuddle up to tales of squalor, gratuitous blood spilling, dehumanized killing, torture and various acts of degradation and wanton barbarity. What distinguishes this little effort from the mainstream snuff porn you can rent at your local sex shop is that the values of womanhood, motherhood and vaginahood are raised on a pedestal on an equal footing with apple pie while all men (i.e. walking phalluses) are portrayed as anti-feminist pigs. For two and a half hours, the spectator is kept in perpetual suspense as to how his/her gag reflex is going to be stimulated next. This passes for art in the United States these days. And it wins Oscars and a lot of moolah for Mr. Weinstein. And, apparently, even the US matriarchy loves it!",1,5,15,12 January 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," What happens when the satire is actually better than the movies it mocks?
","Americans are getting very good at this satire genre. This film is a spot-on parody of every cliché-infested fake country music bio you have ever seen (despite the great performances) from 'Coal Miner's Daughter' to 'I Walk the Line' - which I remember hating for all the things it was not, mainly truthful and meaningful. Every single medical emergency and unwanted pregnancy is there, every ghost from the past, every shameful substance abuse and rehab episode and encounter with the greats of musicdom. The songs cover an extremely wide range from pre-rock to hip-hop, by way of folk, psychedelia and disco. The hero even goes through a 'Brian Wilson' period, which is musically the most complex and challenging part of the film. So much attention has been paid to the writing, the performance and the arrangements of the songs, in fact, in this film, that (1) it should have won Oscars for everyone involved, (2) this is the best original musical in a long time besides being a very good comedy and (3) the DVD has something like three hours of extras, deleted scenes unused songs and jokes, on top of the longer 2 hour version, all memorable and funny. And John C. Reilly has the voice of Roy Orbison with a lot more versatility. The man is a chameleon and a very underrated actor. All of which makes this film a much more sincere homage to American music than any single biopic it makes fun of.",10,3,5,12 April 2008
The Exorcist," Great DVD... Dreary commentary...
","The DVD edition of 'the version you've never seen before' is technically perfect. But the director's commentary is dreadful. It is of the 'descriptive video for the blind' kind, and spends the whole time describing, without insight or originality, everything that happens on screen. The only exceptions give rise to horrendous factual errors. Two of them are in the Irak introduction: William Friedkin talks of 'prophet David' (for Daniel) being buried under Nabuchodonosor and comments on the walls of Nineveh being destroyed by Joshua's trumpets (I don't care how powerful those trumpets were, they were in  Jericoh, 2 thousand miles away). I would have switched the horrid thing off but I stuck with it to understand the only thing that still bothers me with the script, i.e. how the St. Joseph medal Father Merrin finds in Irak ends up around the neck of Father Karras in the last scenes. [Anyone's input on this is welcome.] Unfortunately, this is not the sort of thing Friedkin has on his mind and this apparent contradiction is never explained. We will have to assume that it is a medal that is very common and that Father Karras came across one independently. P.S.: Friedkin's description of the scene where Regan tears off this medal from Father Karras' neck has 'Chris' (Regan's mother) ripping it off the good father's neck...",Null,0,2,24 February 2003
No Country for Old Men," From the same country that brought you legalized torture...
","I had just started watching this on DVD when I very nearly lost my dinner after just two acts of egregious violence in the first minutes of the film. And this was only the prelude. I'm very sorry that the Academy felt it had to crown this kind of demented bloodbath with a prize. This is just more of the same old snuff porn that has been making the rounds of Hollywood since at least 'The Godfather', except now it's being directed by the usually incomprehensible and slow-as-molasses Coen Brothers, who seem to have decided to exchange art for profit, this time around, by following the psychopathic-killer-on-a-rampage gravy train all the way to the bank and giving the dumbed-down US public what they really crave: a virtual murder spree à la Grand Theft Auto with lots of comic book horror. Not that you couldn't see that coming all the way back with 'Blood Simple', of course... In short, this is just the sort of sadistic entertainment Nazis must have craved after a hard day's work at Dachau or Büchenwald. So why did we fight and win that war exactly?",1,12,26,11 March 2008
1941," The exact moment when the doodoo hit the fan.
","There is a scene in `1941' where a German general and a Japanese submarine commander (all over-simplified and therefore hateful racial stereotypes) have kidnapped a hapless country hick (Slim Pickens) and are coaxing him to defecate because he has swallowed a toy compass from a box of Cracker Jacks, that is apparently the only way for their stranded submarine to find its way out of Los Angeles harbour.This scene is not only important because of the way it heralds countless instances of toilet and body fluid humour in Hollywood movies for decades to come. It also acts as a metaphor for the film itself: a bunch of grown men who should know better, hopelessly looking for a sense of direction amid what is basically human excrement.`1941' is one major stinker. What can you say about the intelligence of a script based on events that happened in 1942, that calls itself `1941'? About scriptwriters who apparently hadn't even graduated to potty-training when they wrote this piece of drivel, are responsible in a large degree for the general dumbing-down of America and who went on to write even more infantile opuses like `Forrest Gump'? About a storyline that depends on the public's acceptance of attempted date rape as an amusing premise? About cameos by self-destructive over-the-top substance-abusing actors just this close to an overdose as a medium of entertainment?In my book, `1941' is an important historical milestone in American consciousness. Shot in 1979, it marks the exact moment in time where American movies graduated from simple self-indulgence (i.e. `The Godfather' and countless other films in its wake, glorifying guns, cars, gore, sadistic violence, dismemberment, disloyalty and organized crime as a favourite form of family entertainment) to grossly excessive special-effects-driven children's fare (`Star Wars' and its ilk).It is probably besides the point to add that this film is extremely strained and unfunny and that even its musical score (by John Williams) sounds like Sir Edward Elgar conducting a symphony orchestra during a controlled flatulence contest.I truly resent one commentator's comparison of this film to `It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' which had a sharp, clear morality, which is that greed is not only bad, it is ridiculous. What is the moral of `1941'? Anyone? War is funny? Thank you. I rest my case!To be perfectly fair, writer Zemeckis did eventually obtain redemption for his youthful indiscretions by directing such fine films as `Contact' (an ode to human reason, dedicated to the memory of Carl Sagan) and `What Lies Beneath', which is just plain good.",1,30,55,30 July 2003
JFK," Viewer Beware
","This is my fifth attempt at posting a comment on this film. The four preceding ones never made it and no reason was given by IMDb. I can only suppose they were considered libellous to Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone. All I really wanted to point out is that 'JFK' is loosely based on the opinions of Jim Garrison, which are already in great doubt. According to the facts reported in the book 'American Grotesque' by James Kirkwood who covered the Shaw trial, the very short version of this story is that Jim Garrison had a vendetta against Clay Shaw ever since Shaw (a real Southern gentleman) had once reproved Jim Garrison for slapping his wife in public in a New Orleans restaurant. Clay Shaw was the ultimate victim of Garrison's persecution, which was partly motivated by Mr. Shaw's presumed sexual orientation and Mr. Garrison's very real homophobia. Is this 'clean' and succinct enough for the censors? Thank you.",1,10,29,20 October 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Look, Ma! I'm wearing a feather boa!!
","I got this movie on DVD for Christmas from my older brother Paul, who basically doesn't understand me and never will. He more or less told me: 'I saw this with my girlfriend and we both agreed it was kinetic, it was energetic, it was musical and superficial. We immediately thought of you' After seeing this atrocity, I have to seriously reconsider the image I project to my somewhat conservative family. 'Moulin Rouge!' is the kind of film that makes you really consider with a jaundiced eye the sorry state of contemporary mass culture with desperate questions like 'Have we sunk so low?', 'Can we possibly survive?' and 'Don't we all deserve to die from shame for having had anything to do with the kind of society that can produce such a film and call it art?' I know it was produced by Australians and we should all cut them some slack for their relative lack of sophistication. I know Ms. Kidman gives a truly surprising performance as a dancer-singer (I thought she had no other talent than a certain ability to manipulate the media, which she shared with or possibly learned from her husband Tom Cruise) and I know it is probably supposed not to be taken at face value. But I can't forgive its pompousness, its grandiosity, its masquerading as something important while being such a patchwork of second-hand elements. It is supposed to infuse the viewer with the charm and cultural significance of turn-of-the-century Paris while paying homage to every French romantic creation from 'The Lady of the camelias' and 'Scènes de la vie de bohème' onward. Yet, the only spoken French words in the whole show are 'Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?' from the Patti Labelle 'Lady Marmalade' song, which has nothing whatsoever to do with Paris, Romanticism or French culture. The plot is a distillation of every melodrama ever written down to its bare bones: Poor poet loves girl; girl belongs to rich man; girl spits out her lungs. And this is supposed to be funny? It's anachronistic, turgid, necrophiliac and excessive. It's a movie for people who think synchronized swimming is a life-affirming art. It's what Ren said to Stimpy about cartoons: 'They're only puppets and they'll rot your brains!' It's supposed to make you want to get up and dance. It only made me wish I knew someone intellectually-challenged enough to accept this DVD as a worthwhile gift. The truth about this movie is that it's one big monumental camp that was conceived for people who have no grasp of history, of the world they live in, of their own identity, of their own cultural heritage and who like dressing up in mother's mesh stockings and inventing stories in front of the mirror when there's no one around. It's really meant to bring out the secret drag queen in every viewer. Trouble is I never nurtured my inner drag queen. And I can only see this movie for what it really is: a desperate attempt at meaning from feeble minds and, now that Oscar time is approaching, a desperate grasp for Academy members' attention and the supplementary mazzoola that Oscar's prestige can still confer on this undercooked, overripe tripe.'Moulin Rouge!' - the exclamation point is meant to express revulsion - is to movie musicals what 'Family Guy' is to TV sitcoms: a cheap gimmick for retards, a cheat and an easy way out.",1,40,72,12 February 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," And Michael Moore is still out there wondering why America is so violent.
","For more than thirty years all important American films (and I include musicals and comedies) have been preoccupied with the realistic depiction of the gangster lifestyle and the glorification of greed, violence, sadism, firearms, cars, dismemberment and disembowelling as modes of self-expression or a way of life. This thirty year period of continuous lowering of moral, aesthetic and human standards had to culminate somewhere and it did in the personality of a terminally adolescent movie geek forever fixated on his masturbatory fantasies of celluloid sadomasochism. Quentin Tarantino has misspent his youth cosily sheltered from real life, in dank movie houses, obsessing over the kind of ultra-violent and ultra-nerdy cinema cranked out for the planet's social rejects and epsilons. He is now considered mainstream and the darling of Western intellectuals. When he crawled back under the rock from whence he first emerged, his fans worried. When he finally came out bearing a new opus, like Moses bearing the tablets of the law, it was nothing less than the ultimate legal snuff film for the Grand Theft Auto and MTV generation of immature and imperfectly-socialized twits and a triumph with critics and at the box-office. Nobody seems to mind that, like all his previous films and scripts, his last one is a soul-destroying and gene-altering abomination, not to mention a major rip in the space-time continuum, as long as the teenagers - who are not legally permitted to watch his movies - can get their jollies watching uniformed criminal-type chicks lopping off each other's body parts while blood spurts every which way. But this is considered OK in polite circles because (1) it is well done, (2) it is funny in a kind of mindless, slack-jawed, socially irresponsible way and (3) this type of violence refers to an existing nerdy sub-genre of adolescent fantasy (kung fu movies, triad movies, what have you), which makes it a bona fide cultural artefact worthy of anthropological study. No one seems to mind either that, reportedly, irony and decadence have been pronounced dead after September 11, 2001. Nothing hinders art's progress, after all. Tarantino would still be popular - and probably more so - if he admitted to having single-handedly warped the minds of all of America's youth and his responsibility for society's widespread desensitization to gore, murder, violence and the suffering of others.",Null,0,0,24 October 2003
How to Train Your Dragon," Perfect in every way
","There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It's incredibly well-conceived on an intellectual level, it is well-planned in the ways of art direction, lighting and photography, exhibiting a look that many live-action films can only dream of. The script is spotless, the idea is original and the talent is outstanding. (Gerard Butler is the most underrated technical actor of his generation, even when he keeps his shirt on.) Furthermore, it carries a positive message that young people should not necessarily follow in the footsteps of their elders when they find a better way. The only people who could object to that have to be Republicans or Tea Partiers.Finally, am I the only one who finds a resemblance between the friendly dragon Toothless and Stitch but also with Totoro of 'My Neighbor Totoro'? It is wonderful to see that Dreamworks Animation has attained such brilliance after acquiring talent from Disney Studios and borrowing the best technology around. (Weren't those clouds in the 2003 live-action 'Peter Pan'?) I was very impressed by the off-beat humour of 'Over the Hedge' but this film's expressive animation just blows me away.Finally, it is very refreshing to see a film with a full spectrum of colours as opposed to the depressing blue-green live-action atrocities of the last ten years.",10,2,4,20 October 2010
The Da Vinci Code," A very poor and joyless adaptation, probably financed by the Opus Dei
","I saw the film in a packed Toronto house. The crowd was silent and attentive, with the people around me repressing just a few yawns toward the end. I liked the exposition parts, which gave life to some very involved explanations with the help of interesting low-resolution visuals and historical recreations. But, as a travelogue or illustrated appendix to the book, the film suffers from anaemic colours and pallid photography. A lot of the scenes take place at night or under cloudy skies or in murky indoor locations. Sad to say, but the novel had better visuals...The action scenes are jumbled and close-cropped - TV-style - so it's hard to get a clear idea of what goes on. In one isolated flash of genius, the film shows an instant replay of what just happened from a different point of view in order to answer questions the viewer might have. It works - as it does in the book - and this technique should have been repeated in other instances, especially after the big showdown in Westminster Abbey, which peters out like a wet firecracker without it.The monuments shown, whether real or stand-ins, are rarely presented in all their architectural glory even when the camera pulls back for an establishing shot (which is not often). You never feel like you are in Paris or in London. I kept thinking I'd prefer the matte paintings of old to this kind of botched and pedestrian location photography. There is never any sense of awe, wonder, amazement, grandeur, majesty, magic, joy, celebration, mystery, intrigue or emotion and you don't feel the excitement of discovery or urgency, which should be an essential ingredient of any treasure hunt. Howard paints all scenery as well as all human interactions with only one colour: grey. The music is equally lugubrious and oppressive and sounds like it was penned during an acute bout of Prozac withdrawal.Changes were made to the original story, some of which are justified when they speed up the action, while others are missed opportunities to reprise what worked best in the novel. Especially abhorrent is the change that was made in Sophie's family tree, which can only be explained by a misplaced sense of prudery. It robs the ending of any human warmth and closure. Any hint of sexual attraction between the protagonists has also been surgically removed, so as not to mix s-e-x with all the 'seriousness' that goes on. The screenwriter has even gone out of his way to not offend any religious sensibilities by planting a lot of 'ifs' and 'buts' in every argument and even a discreet disclaimer about the 'Prieuré de Sion' hoax. From that point of view, the film was made by a yellow-bellied prude hedging his bets at every turn and unwilling to listen to a second opinion. It is so reticent about its own subject matter that it may be suspected of having been financed by the Opus Dei to defuse the controversy. It's easy to imagine Howard wearing a cilice all through the shooting of this picture and taking time out for bouts of self-flagellation in order to remind himself that no despicable fleshly enjoyment at all should be derived by anyone from this picture. It feels like a film about Catholic dogma directed by a Puritan Quaker.A good part of the film is in French and acted by competent French actors, which makes Hanks' horrible pronunciation stand out like a sore thumb. I mean the guy is supposed to be an international scholar, for Magdalen's sake, and he still takes half a minute to struggle through the words 'Bois de Boulogne'. I guess Hanks' time is too valuable to sit in front of a language coach for half an hour, which also explains why his character acts at all times like he is slightly annoyed because he has other, more pressing engagements and this whole shoot is playing havoc with his social calendar. Audrey Tautou is charming and believable and one feels for her character's many predicaments as well as for the horrible cuts that were made to her back-story. Jean Reno has to struggle with a part that makes him even more of a one-dimensional heel and a chump than his character was in the book (yes, it's possible), while also making him sadistic, incompetent and a gullible religious fanatic, which he never was in the book. Ian McKellen gives his all, as usual, and tries, in vain, to save the film single-handedly. He certainly deserves an honorary keystone. The Silas character (Paul Bettany) has been reduced to a sideshow non-entity trotted around for pure shock value. We never learn where he came from or what the hell that accent is supposed to be (French-Spanish-Latin retard?). His last words ('I am a ghost') are particularly appropriate since he couldn't very well say: 'Is that all there is to my part?' In conclusion, it's an unnecessarily timid adaptation that is more than a little depressing, if not outright morbid, in its delivery. The flashbacks about Silas' childhood and his relationship to his protector, for instance, and Sophie's falling out with her grandfather, are not long enough to reveal anything of interest and only add to the atmosphere of randomness and confusion. I personally did not see where the budget went because it's certainly not on screen, even if all the historical flashbacks were CGI, and some palms had to be greased at the Louvre and Mr. Tom 'Nice Guy' Hanks insists on a solid gold bidet in his private quarters.When I left the theatre, the colours of a springtime sunset in downtown Toronto were absolutely breathtaking by comparison. Final thoughts: The book had its faults but it was certainly better than this and that is the only disclaimer that should have been put at the beginning of the picture.",3,4,9,21 May 2006
Mystic River," In the long and morally repugnant tradition of films glorifying the mobster lifestyle
","I vomited when I first saw this morally bankrupt film and I am still feeling queasy writing this. 'Mystic River' has the outward appearance of a worthwhile drama until you come to the clincher, which is that, in life, there are weak people, people you can execute without proof of their guilt  or who deserve to die or be raped, or both, like the Tim Robbins character, because they can't defend themselves or can't manage to be loved or respected by their wife or, like the dead girl, because she tried to escape her father's control. And then there are the strong who murder and rape other people and can get away with it because they have sexually satisfied and lobotomized, loving wives and they benefit from a strong support network in their community. The strong characters happen to be mobsters and the film glorifies their lifestyle. In all respects, this film is a practical manual for the application of Nazi principles to daily life situations. This would be enough to qualify 'Mystic River' as the best screen adaptation of 'Mein Kampf' so far, if you don't count the works of Cronenberg or Tarantino. But wait, as they say, there's more...The Tim Robbins character having been kidnapped and sodomized by heterosexual authority figures when he was a kid, grows up to attack a homosexual man having sex with a teenager in a parked car (we're talking about consensual gay sex, here). He brutally kills the man in retribution for his past. The discovery of the victim's body only serves, in this film, to confirm Tim Robbins' 'innocence' of another crime, because the life of a homo has absolutely no bearing in the equation of life, death and justice in this twisted universe. In a Greek tragedy, the fact that Sean Penn's daughter was killed by the children of a man he has himself killed earlier would have been considered delayed justice or the work of fatality (i.e. divine retribution). Not in this film, it ain't! Sean Penn has already avenged himself on the wrong person (the 'loser', the weak guy, Tim Robbins) and he walks away scot-free from this horrible act of stupidity and primal bestiality with the help of his loving wife (Laura Linney in a masterful performance) and the complicity of his childhood friend, the cop (Kevin Bacon), because (1) the cop considers that he has more things in common with the perpetrator of this crime (Penn) than with its victim (Robbins) since they share the same pagan values of the 'school yard code', which says that it is simply not cool to snitch  which also happens to be the Mafia's founding principle; (2) both men are normal heterosexuals who share the same penis obsession (the penis must prevail), Kevin Bacon being more preoccupied with his marital problems (born of a typically macho lack of communication with his wife) than with upholding the law; and (3) gangster Penn has the means to buy the silence of Tim Robbins' widow (because, as usual in this kind of film, crime pays very well, thank you).The finale is particularly stomach-churning: The two happy heterosexual couples (Penn, Bacon and their subservient wives) are all smiles as they bask in the noon-day sun while the unworthy female (Robbins' widow) hides her shame in the shadows. Because she is the real guilty party, don't you know. She snitched'Mystic River' is just another chapter in the long history of the glorification of gangster and hit man values in modern American films, which started with 'The Godfather'. It is a piece of degenerate filth with an A-list veneer. It also deifies the invincible heterosexual paternal phallus, which must be respected and worshipped at all times, as a perfect representation of Bush's America.",1,12,20,22 March 2006
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Lie
","If this movie is the nadir of Hollywood dishonest trickery and whitewashed falsehoods masquerading as fact, how does one explain its popularity? Here are some clues: In the part where the film does talk about mathematics, it makes the viewer feel that he is more intelligent than he actually is, which is always a good idea when you're aiming for the lowest common denominator and you want your picture to sell tickets in the Ozarks as well as in Hollywood.In the part where the film talks about romance, the worst possible woman's picture clichés are dragged out to show Nash as 'different' and desirable. In actuality, he was nerdish, odd and gay.In the part that talks about his schizophrenia, terrible care is taken to avoid mentioning the fact that the 1950's persecution of homosexuals had a lot to do with Nash's worsening condition. John Nash was forced to conceal his homosexuality and was persecuted for it by the same government that expected him to decrypt secrets for them and keep quiet about it. If that isn't enough to turn any brilliant mind into a paranoid-schizophrenic, I really don't know what is.In all the other parts, the bad script and the bad out-of-place acting by miscast actors are immensely aided by photographic special effects and by the music (or rather non-music) of James Horner, the inventor of today's omnipresent minimalist 'fear music', where the cinema's sub-woofers are put to maximum use to make the viewer feel danger directly through his anal sphincter, the only part of one's anatomy that is actually needed to 'enjoy' this film as written.",1,38,73,19 September 2010
Ice Age," Whoa Mammoth Beyond Excellence!
","`Ice Age' has the kind of heart, warmth, humanity, artistic excellence and imagination, innovation and honest belly-laughs that have officially gone missing from Disney animation movies since `Atlantis'. I was also pleased to recognize in some of the characters the kind of superlative modelling that characterizes the best of the View-Master 3-D children's subjects from the 50's and 60's. Fox rules!",10,1,3,27 November 2002
The Queen," One of the best films of the last five years
","I saw this over the holidays and I consider it my best outing at a cinema in at least five years. I wasn't made to feel disgusted with the human race and I actually learned something. It is all the more surprising since Stephen Frears has made a specialty of portraying the working classes, if not the lower depths of humanity and his latest venture ('Mrs. Henderson Presents', a nudie musical starring Judi Dench!) was a total and abject misfire.I am a Canadian so Elizabeth (Elisabeth with an 's' in French) is my Queen, even though French Canadians are not reputed to love her. I appreciate that she actually speaks better French than most of our our prime ministers. And I have always felt personally sorry for her during the death of Lady Di fracas, a humiliation she never deserved. This film demonstrates with fictitious means the opinion that she is not only a very special human being but also the best queen England has ever had. Helen Mirren's interpretation is utterly convincing and probably inspired by months of study of Elizabeth's footage in the 1992 BBC cinéma-vérité documentary 'Elizabeth R' (not listed on the IMDb and not available on DVD), which is still the definitive document on the Queen's real personality.I found the whole experience simultaneously overwhelming and respectful, intricate in its details and nuances and somewhat poetic. The stag episode, especially, shows that she has subordinated her lifelong love of animals and much of her personal likes and dislikes to the dictates of tradition and the royal family's male obsession for the hunt. It also gives her a rare occasion to get in touch with her own feelings concerning mortality and Di's passing away.Lady Di comes off as a floozy who played with fire by courting the medias (and was eventually destroyed by them) but was also a good mother, which is how it should be and the best way to remember her. Tony Blair comes off as a cynical but juvenile opportunist/upstart who still has a few hard political and life lessons to learn. I won't even mention how his wife is portrayed; she is probably the only character in the film who would have reason to sue the filmmakers if not for the fact that it all probably happened exactly as depicted.",10,1,3,5 January 2007
Blade Runner," Best film about slavery and the nature of mortality... ever!
","These were also the themes of Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator', which is not a good film because of the casual way it exploits history to make its point. Whereas 'Gladiator' is a film full of grand-standing and hollow gestures that disrespect the past, 'Blade Runner' is a film that imagines, with great respect, a future that could be and uses it to stage a valid morality play about the nature of humanity, slavery and mortality. One could say that Ridley Scott is more respectful of the future that he is of the past. I only know the film from the director's cut and I find it a perfect film...Here are a few things I like about this film that have rarely been duplicated in another sci-fi film and were never again put together with the same care:* believable dialogue that is spare and to the point and gives away just enough information to keep things on the 'noir' side and for the viewer to imagine the rest - dialogue that becomes poetry by Lautréamont in the mouth of Rutger Hauer; * a plausible and evocative atmosphere composed of set design, lighting, photography and special effects that really gel together, combining attention to detail with sweep and scope; * acting, casting and faces that help the telling of the story (Hauer is the definitive hero of the 21st millennium, a Christ figure and a much better and more complex man than anybody else in the film); * music (by Vangelis) that provides both space-age lounge music, psychological density and the kind of eeriness that was formerly Nino Rota's unassailed trademark.It is an action movie that opens a whole new can of philosophical worms towards the end when the humanity of the enslaved replicant is demonstrated and the hero's motives and his own humanity are questioned. The whole film is so noble that it could be about the start of a new breed of Christians revolting against the industrial-military complex and a world government gone berserk for profit.It remains one of the only worthy commercial films of the 80's to come out of the USA.A WORD ON THE DVD: The Director's Cut DVD has no extras and the print, while very watchable, suffers from horizontal shakiness that causes a real strain on the bitrate and indicates that it could stand a good restoration. Every fan is praying for a Special Edition that would combine the original cut, the director's cut, a few analytical commentaries and as many extras as one can come up with. Criterion Edition, anyone?",10,0,1,29 May 2006
