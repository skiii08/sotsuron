Minority Report," $100 million FX and a two-bit screenplay
","As great as it is to see a good-looking movie (even if their world doesn't include the colour yellow), why can't the A-flight directors give us a story we haven't seen a dozen times before, and a problem with a solution so obvious that a reasonably bright eight year old can figure it out?  ('But Daddy, why isn't it enough that they just STOP the person from killing?')While they're at it, maybe they could give us a reason to care about the main character other than 'because it's played by Tom Cruise'.So what we have is a darn-fine looking movie (though nowhere near the level of, say, the Matrix or Dark City), with a so-so story that contains exactly one nifty little turn.  The rest is recycled cheese.",Null,0,0,22 December 2002
