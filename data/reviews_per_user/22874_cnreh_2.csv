The Blair Witch Project," A waste of time and money
","This movie has the quality of a home video. It tries being special and fails. If you watch it in a cinema the only feeling you will have is sickness due to the uncontrolled movement of the camera. I was nearly bored to death and waited desperately for the film to end. Even the most common Hollywood phrases are featured (despite not being  a Hollywood movie): 'Mom, Dad, ... I love you ...' and 'We are US citizens, they cannot do this to us' (or something similar).",1,21,42,22 August 2002
Hero," Great pictures
","This movie is like a beautiful painting. The colors, the perspectives the ideas on how the scences are constructed are simply beautiful. The only bad thing that you could say about the movie is that the story is very simple which is probably because it is based on a legend or fairy tale.",9,0,0,18 February 2004
