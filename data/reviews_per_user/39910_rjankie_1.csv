Angels & Demons," This is not the book!
","While reading the book, I was excited to see the movie. The book was super. The movie was a big disappointment. Critical parts were changed or even missing.The setup of the whole story was changed and some characters were totally missing. Symbols were changed in the movie (that's what Robert Langdon is all about). Ron Howard made great movies. But this one just missed it. Credits though on the magnificent scenery and of the Vatican City indoors. The explosion at the end was as expected and really felt like the 'beginning'. Still, highly disappointed. If you read Thomas Harris' 'Silence of the lambs' and then see the movie, it's amazing how they managed to get every detail of the book in the movie. That's why SOTL is an Oscar movie. If fear this one is not.",3,8,23,15 May 2009
