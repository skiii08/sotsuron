The Lobster," Highly symbolical (and/or absurd) and thought-provoking
","Here's a note I wrote to my friend who had endorsed the film to me:'I have just watched The Lobster, which you also recommended. It was very good. Perhaps the best 'artsy' film I have seen (rating: 7/8 out of 10). I can easily imagine that it sits very well with a cinephile like yourself.
I can also understand why some people hate this kind of movie. It is probably a matter of whether one is willing to watch a movie as symbolism - and still feel that you get something out of it. If you watch this kind of film through glasses of realism you will feel frustrated.
The movie emphasized many points about relationships and relationship status in our culture and it also had a beautiful symbolism about sacrifice in love.'",7,0,2,17 March 2018
Unknown," Entertaining paranoid action thriller, though not among the greats of the genre
","The build-up is exciting: Someone has stolen the identity and life of the protagonist ... or is he, himself, going insane? Martin Harris (the ever reliable Liam Neeson) explains the struggle in his mind as: 'a war between being told who you are and knowing who you are.' The premise is followed by great action scenes and twists and turns to keep you guessing most of the way. A movie like this, however, ends well by keeping suspension of disbelief on a tight leash, for the viewer to really invest emotionally. The third act, unfortunately, looses the grip. Where genre classics like The Fugitive (1993) and The Game (1997) held the viewer fast to the heart-pounding end, Unknown Identity ends up increasingly far-fetched, and it eventually couldn't keep me truly caring about the story.6/10",6,0,0,3 February 2018
