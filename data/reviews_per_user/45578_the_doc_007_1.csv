Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," the worst movie I have ever paid to see
","I laughed out loud a couple times, and chuckled mildly at several more points. That is all that can be said positively about this movie.I find movies like Super Troopers, and even deliberate gross-out movies like Date Movie, quite funny. This, however, was so patently offensive, I only stayed because I refuse to walk out on any movie. The nudity was bad enough, but the unrelenting mediocrity and lack of style was far worse. Perhaps you have to see the show first, but I simply found it to be awful.If it was meant to be a social commentary, it is an incredibly crude one - intelligent analysis should be the standard, not shock value. If it was supposed to be a comedy, it was still a failure - deadpan delivery works for a short time, but if used continuously, it loses the ability to surprise. It really is the worst movie I have ever paid to see.",1,166,331,19 November 2006
