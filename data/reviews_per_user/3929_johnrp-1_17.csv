Spartacus," A true classic that defines the metric for all movies
","Okay, so this movie is corny. Okay, so it's campy. Okay, so I can't think of another word to excuse myself for liking it so much, but hey .. it's Kirk Douglas at his best. Masters and slaves, arenas and killing, the good guys against the bad guys. This movie has it all, and though you know that the bad guys have to win, the movie ends with that silver-screen ray of hope for us all. Yes Virginia, the Roman Empire will one day fall.But seriously, if you haven't seen this movie, you just gotta stop whatever you're doing, run out right now and rent it. Make sure you have some popcorn at home .. this is truly a theater-style movie and requires overly buttered popcorn and lots and lots of salt.No special effects. No giant spiders attacking from outer space. Just lots of good acting. No, make that lots of great acting. The character development is what makes this movie what it is and Hollywood should be ashamed for forgetting what entertainment is all about.Hey .. why are you still reading this? Go rent it now!",10,1,3,3 October 2002
Se7en," Was this a low budget film or what?
","Gee, you'd think with all the big-name actors and actresses (Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Gwenyth Paltrow) in this movie, that they could have afforded something brighter than an 15 watt light bulb. This movie is dark. I'm not talking about the murder and the mystery. I'm talking about not being to see a darn thing during the movie. I mean, is there something bad about having a little color or light in a movie?And everyone is so miserably unhappy all the time, you've got to wonder why they stay on those jobs. I mean, go to New Zealand and raise sheep! Go save whales for a year with Greenpeace! Get yourself a nightshift job at a Denny's! I mean, ANYTHING but working in that dark depressing city!",8,0,2,23 February 2003
Monster," Do NOT watch this if you are feeling depressed
","This movie is great. Depressing but great.Charlize Theron won a ton of awards for her performance and if it were my choice, I'd give her twice as many! She was unbelievable. A hooker trying to survive in a world that (metaphorically) had killed her long before she gets executed. I don't know how closely this movie follows the real story, but it's riveting.Now, this is not the type of movie that I plan on seeing again anytime soon. But I did buy the DVD because it's worth watching several times. I just think that I need a year between viewings to catch my breath! The acting by the rest of the cast is pretty darn good too. Lots of character actors and smokey bar types. You watch stuff like this and wonder if this type of life exists anywhere for real - but sadly you know that it does.The moral of the movie? Not sure I know.",9,1,2,1 January 2005
Billy Elliot," A truly pleasant, funny, heart warming film.
","This is not the movie to see if you want shoot 'em up, big explosions, laser beams and blood and guts. No special effects to speak of. Just great acting and a still greater plot. The characters are priceless and the only thing I regretted in the movie was it not being longer. I've never considered ballet so manly before .. okay, I still don't, but the ballet dancing is really a small part of the movie. What comes out in huge bold letters is the will power of a child to achieve his dreams. If only everyone were so driven by a lust for life, what a world this would be! Billy Eliot is definitely one for the must-have collection!",9,0,0,24 December 2002
We Were Soldiers," Very entertaining and disturbing
","It's hard to say what I didn't like about this movie. The acting was great. The effects were great. The dialogue was great. The tempo was non-stop. Maybe that was it ... I rented this and found I had to take a break to get my breath back! Should a movie really engage you so closely in the dirty realities of battle? Watching ET ride a bicycle across the sky is so much easier on the brain. Do I really want to watch guys getting their bodies shot apart?Still, I'd highly recommend the movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. I did find Mel Gibson to be a bit of an awkward fit for Colonel Moore. His pretty boy face was a bit short of real for the gutsy role, even with all the dirt and blood smeared on it. But being the actor he is, he pulls it off. A young Scott Glenn would have been a best cast for the part.What I did really like about the movie is that it did not overly glamorize or deify war. Both the Americans and the Vietnamese suffered greatly, and the movie effectively showed suffering on both sides. Haven't seen this yet? Go rent it now. This is not the type of movie you'll want to watch several times .. once is enough, but still, you'll enjoy it.",7,4,6,25 November 2002
Lost in Translation," The Plot was Lost in Translation
","I can't believe that so many people give this movie a '10'. It was truly horrible. The jokes were stale, the humor was high-schoolish and overused, and the tempo was slower than Tim Conway's old man skit.And they billed this movie as a comedy? It was sad to see Bill Murray acting so badly. Did he really need the money that much? And what is it with all the underwear scenes with Johansson? Okay, she's cute, but 9/10ths of her screen shots were just her sitting there in her underwear with a miserable depressed face. Clearly, someone behind the camera liked her legs.This movie rates a '1'.  And that's being generous!",1,1,4,12 December 2003
Lost in Translation," Good, but not great
","Bill Murray did very well at playing a man in mid-life crisis, and in that role he was quite boring and morose. The acting was in fact very good, but the overall plot was thin and the editing was a bit too stark.
I'd recommend seeing the movie, but I wouldn't buy the DVD.",1,0,2,2 October 2003
American Beauty," A decent movie, but not great - highly overrated
","I'm not sure why so many people raved about this movie. It was entertaining and the acting was pretty good. Kevin Spacey was, as always, fantastic. In fact, I found that to be one of the sore spots in the movie. Spacey was so good that the other acting - albeit okay - simply didn't measure up.
Still ... it's worth a see. But I don't think I'd shell out to buy it. Once was enough.",5,0,0,20 December 2003
Dark City," This is dark. Dark. Did I mention it's dark?
","Dark city, dark scenes, dark characters, dark settings, dark plot, dark dark dark. If you don't like dark, do NOT watch this movie!Oddly enough, I enjoyed it. The idea of having my life be an experiment by someone seems to give it more value than it probably really does have. But fortunately, I don't have to live in such a dark domain.Hey .. maybe I'm a character in Light City? Light scenes, light characters, light settings, light plot, ....?Then again, maybe not.",6,1,3,19 December 2003
Man on the Moon," Very interesting movie ... interesting
","Very interesting, yes. Interesting is a good word for this movie. If I had to call it something, I'd call it ... interesting.But good? Hmmmm, not really. Entertaining? Hmmmm, not really. Enjoyable? Hmmmm, not really.But definitely interesting. I would in fact recommend seeing this movie. Andy Kaufman was an - what word comes to mind - ah, interesting guy! And this movie fits him to a tee.And Jim Carrey gives an Oscar-deserving performance here. He brings Andy back to life. And that is saying something, particularly if you ever had the pleasure to see Andy in person. You see, Andy wasn't a comedian. He didn't excel in drama, or mystery, or any common form of entertainment. Andy was the quintessential essence of performance. I don't mean that he was a performance artist. I mean that literally ... Andy WAS the performance.And this movie does capture that. My only problem with the movie is that it does in fact capture Andy so well that ... it's unnerving. The 'entertainment' factor disappears as you feel more and more uncomfortable watching it.But uncomfortable was Andy's middle name.He would have liked this movie.",6,0,0,12 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gripping, Spellbinding, Enthralling, Mesmerizing ...
","Oh man, where's a thesaurus when you need one!If you hadn't noticed, I absolutely LOVED this movie! Violence, greed, power, lust, corruption, betrayal ... it has all the makings of a biography of a congressional lobbyist, but without the glitter.The first movie was a bit 'too busy' for my taste. I prefer to inhale every now and then. This movie seemed better balanced and even during the enormous fight scenes, there was enough pause to blink. The bad guys seemed somehow more real in this version also. Maybe because you got to hear some of them talk now and then. Seeing the monsters bickering about not having enough fresh food to eat and whining about doing a five day forced march also made them (dare I say) .. more human.Anyway, I can't wait for the final chapter.  I don't think I could survive the 9-hour marathon viewing of all three chapters (my friends are all ready for it), but I certainly will be in line for the first opening in my area for the final chapter. If it's half as good as Two Towers, I won't be disappointed.Gee ... I guess I should go read the books now!",9,1,1,25 November 2003
Amadeus," A masterpiece. Quite fitting given its subject.
","I saw the Broadway play years back, with F. Murray Abraham playing Salieri. It was nothing less than spellbinding. Afterwards, I went to see the movie. I was prepared to be disappointed, but the movie was just as compelling, just as engaging as watching it on stage. Aside from the obvious accolades for stunning costumes and, of course, the music, what makes this movie so wonderful is the amazing acting. There are scenes that carry more acting skill in a couple minutes then many movies have in total.
And again, I must mention the music. So incredibly wonderful. And just in case you're wondering ... I'm a rock fan from the 70's!",10,3,5,3 October 2002
Pi," 3.whatever
","Hey, I like mathematics as well as the next ... probably even more so. The thought of pi having some spiritual significance is not new - numerologists have been searching for gods in numbers since the first person learned how to add.But this bordered on ridiculous. To be fair, I did find parts of the movie entertaining, but only parts. The tempo varied from too fast to too slow with little consistency of plot, acting, or settings. I decided to be 'generous' and give this a 5/10, mostly because I like pi... not the movie, but the number.",5,1,2,19 December 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," One of the true classics
","I just had to give this movie a 10. Could it have been better? Of course it could. The acting was campy, the plot was ridiculous, and the storyline is full of holes.But still ... what would the holidays be without watching Bill Bailey fight the evil forces and ultimately winning our hearts over and over again?This is what movies are all about - touching our emotions so deep and so firmly that we can never let go. We all cry when he cries, laugh when he laughs, and cheer at the end of the movie. It's the quintessential feel-good movie of all time!",10,0,6,20 December 2003
Man on Fire," Great acting, mediocre script, horrible cinematography
","I gave this film a low score. Denzel Washington was astonishing! Dakota Fanning (the little girl Pita) gave an Oscar winning performance! The other characters in the movie were equally great. Simply great!So why the low score? Paul Cameron's cinematography was horrible. No wait, horrible isn't bad enough. Putrid? Hmmm, maybe that's still not quite the right word.How about mind-numbingly awful? Dreadful? Really really NOT GOOD?Man, I just can't describe how bad it was. At time, I found myself purposely not watching the film and just listening to it instead so that I didn't have to watch Cameron's display of total lack of talent.Cameron has done some good stuff before. I think that maybe he tried too hard to add some 'artistic flair' to the movie or something.But I do recommend seeing the movie. Rent it, don't buy it. It's very depressing and the ending is a bit stupid, but it's worth a watch.",1,15,39,1 November 2004
Goodfellas," Goodfellas, Good Movie!
","Nothing compares to the perplexing feelings you get as you find yourself feeling 'good' as this group of narcissistic scummy psychotic social deviates rampage across the screen committing every vile act imaginable.But still, it's a good feeling, good flowing, goodfella movie!I watch this frequently because I never tire of the phenomenal acting, the wonderful narration, and the fantastic music!",10,0,0,20 December 2003
The Godfather," A true classic in which you forget you're watching a movie
","What makes this movie so great is that the characters seem to leap off the screen, often after only a few minutes. I've never quite figured it out, but it's as if you already know these guys, their habits, their mannerisms, their strengths and faults. Like Clemenza, a guy you hate to love - he'd just as easily kill you as he would pick a weed off his lawn, yet you can't help but respect him. Respect him? What am I saying? But that's the ticket with this movie, Clemenza, Pauli, Tom, Santino, Sal ... these people are so real, it's scary. Oddly enough, the only person who seems an ill fit is Michael, at the start that is. How can anyone so clean cut be related? But Pacino makes it work (unbelievable acting) and nothing is more engaging that watching the 'transformation' he goes through as he becomes the Don.",10,0,1,18 September 2002
