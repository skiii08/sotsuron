The Rock," Good Cheesy Fun
","Just watched this for the first time in years. I like the way the film just gets straight into the story and straight into the action from minute one. There's definitely some moments of cheese but it's a fun watch. Man, I'm getting old. I can't believe I first watched this on VHS tape lol! Soon I'll be as old as Sean Connery's character! Anyway, thumbs up from me and overall this film has aged very well. 7/10",7,0,0,17 February 2020
First Man," Not Bad But Not Great
","This film isn't bad but it isn't anywhere near as good as The Right Stuff. For me, the film drags on too much about Neil's 'personal life' (yawn). The director had a wealth of space and technical story lines to follow but a large bulk of this film deals with Neil and his wife (Zzz). I found that part of film slow, boring and a tad pointless. To cap it off, the film then only spends about 5 minutes dealing the moon landing. Regarding the flag issue, as a Brit who was born in 1971, I generally would have liked to have seen the moment the flag was planted. It's a part of history I didn't see live and it doesn't bother me that American's planted it. It's an iconic moment in human history so to not see it was a strange call to make. To sum up, I enjoyed the film; however, it was just a bit slow and dull in places. 6.5/10 does it for me.",6,1,3,10 February 2019
Captain Marvel," I quite liked it
","Just rented this on dvd for Â£2. I thought it was ok and I quite liked it. Eat some nibbles, switch of your brain for a bit and go along for the ride. It wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst. 5.5/10 for me.",6,0,0,7 July 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Bland
",It's watchable but it's not funny. It's just bland and pretty 'meh'. All that money spent on the film.. and they couldn't pay someone to write a funny script. It's mad really. 4.5 /10,4,2,9,28 June 2020
The Irishman," Don't read the book first..
","I did..and I thought it was better than the film! The book goes A-Z with regards to the story, whereas the film goes all over the shop. Also, a few things that happen in the film happened differently in real life according to the book. Anyway, I found the film ok but I wasn't blown away (pun intended) by it. It just seemed to be a film by the numbers. It's all been done and seen before now. To sum up, it's ok but it's nothing amazing. 6/10 does it for me.",6,4,10,29 November 2019
Aquaman," Very Bad
","Wooden acting, wooden dialogue, wooden storyline, wooden baddies, and way too long. For a Â£3 dvd rental, I was robbed! I would say this was a paint it by numbers film, but half the numbers were sadly drawn in crayon. Very poor. 4/10",4,0,1,30 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Not bad but not great
","First of all, the film is about 30 minutes too long. It got a bit boring in places. Some of the humour is ok but a lot of it is forced. It's hard to put your finger on the problem, but I feel the film is just trying too hard to be cool. It's watchable but it's not as good as the first one. It's ok but it's a bit bland and a bit 'meh' in places. 6/10 is about right for me.",6,0,2,3 September 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Starts off good but then flatlines
","I think tkmcc-08780 sums up my feelings for this movie very well so I won't say much more. After about 80 minutes, I was quite bored and I'd stopped caring for all the characters. It just became bland. 6/10 is my score.",6,3,5,15 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," More like a TV Movie
","I've been a big Queen fan since 1984 but I didn't think this film was very good. The timeline was a tad squiffy, somethings in it didn't happen and I thought Malek completely over played the part. All he did was pout, suck his lips and bend backwards with a microphone. And the teeth..lol.. it was like watching a cartoon. Some of the dialogue wasn't great either. I'm glad I only paid £3 to rent the dvd because it seemed like a TV movie to me. 5/10 does it for me.",5,1,3,4 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Bloated and Bland: 5.5/10
","Crikey, this film went on for ever thus making it a tad dull. Something is happening on planet a, meanwhile on planet b one team are getting ready to go to planet c, once on planet c, the baddie lands on planet d, team 1 then head off to planet e, while team 2 regroup on planet f and so on. At 2 hours 20, this was about 50 minutes too long. It was an ok film but it was also quite bland. 5.5/10 for me.",6,1,4,26 August 2018
Mr. Nobody," Good film..a tad long though!
","I liked this but it was 30 minutes too long, so it dragged a bit in places. I also had to read up about the ending cos I was..ermm..you what? lol. Others have described this film well and as it's now 00:34, I'm off to beddy byes. Thumbs up though, good film. 7.5/10",7,0,1,27 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Pile of pants
","I paid £3 to rent this film from my local dvd store (I know! We still have a local dvd store! 3 films, £6, 2 nights lol!) Anyhoo, it's not worth £3, it's worth about 49p. Others have already explained the glaring pot holes, the moronic family, the utter boredom, the lack of plot, the lack of suspense, the backwards nail, the dodgy eery music etc. I just started laughing at the scene with the old man. By the nail scene, I couldn't have cared less about anyone in the film. Tension? Lol. There's more tension in my underpants after a curry and 5 pints then in this entire film. Yeah..not for me.",3,0,3,9 August 2018
Pawn Sacrifice," That Was Some Hard Core Pawnography
","Just caught this on Netflix UK and I thought it was a great watch for a lazy Sunday. I'm not sure how much of it was true but man alive, I think it's fair to say, Mr F's 'head was in the shed'. Definitely some mental issues going on there. I thought it was filmed well, cast well, acted very well and directed well. Overall, an enjoyable watch.",8,2,2,11 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's the Highlander 2 of Star Wars
","Just finished watching it on dvd rental for £3. I'd like my £3 back lol. Man alive, it was soooo bad it was hilarious. I genuinely think it has to be the worst Star Wars film ever made. And that Mary Poppins scene..it's a good job I wasn't in a cinema, I literally laughed out aloud. Where to start? Terrible dialogue, wooden acting, lame characters, lame story, lame baddy, the force becoming like Harry Potter. Overall, thumbs down. It did however, make me laugh (not intentionally) so that's something. And now for coffee!",3,22,31,3 April 2018
The King," Good.. but they made a lot of it up!
","I originally had this down as a 7/10 film..and then I did some research. Bad move! Turns out old Henry wasn't a pacifist at all. He was a 'hack em all down' type of guy. Also, a lot of the one to one fights never happened in real life and Sir John Falstaff is a fictional character who is mentioned in four plays by William Shakespeare. Ok! So, basically, they made most of it up! Anyway, that said, it's an enjoyable film. It's written well, acted and directed well. The film held my attention and drew me into the story. 6.5/10",6,2,5,4 November 2019
The Shape of Water," This rubbish won 4 Oscars? Lol
",Ha! What a terrible film. Where to start? It's very cheesy. It has a predictable story with no major arc. The characters all fit Hollywood tick boxes. The script is poor and linear. Overall. I was not impressed and consider this to be a poor film. The only thing that saves this cak is that it's filmed nicely.,4,3,6,19 June 2018
Joker," Bland
","I didn't think much of this. Everything felt so contrived. The reasons for him going 'off it' were very forced and not very convincing. It also seems that black people don't date each other and white people don't date each other anymore in 'New Hollywood' as there was the yet again the cliched inter-relationship (got to tick those boxes). I thought the actress who played 'the bird' wasn't very good and I also found their initial relationship / attraction just wasn't believable. Again, poor writing. It was filmed well but I found the script poor, the dialogue clunky and overall just 'meh'. I'm glad I only payed Â£3 to rent this.",4,3,15,2 February 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Good cheesy fun!
","Just caught this on Netflix UK. I have to say, I liked it! I had 3 beers, switched off my brain and went along for a very enjoyable ride. Sure, the script isn't Oscar material but who cares. All in all, I found this good cheesy fun! 7/10",7,1,1,7 November 2019
Black Panther," Utter Pants
","Well this was a major disappointment. Terrible acting, awful dialogue and characters that I had no empathy with. From the moment this film started, it looked very bad. How people can award this pap 10 is beyond me. I paid £3 to rent this from my local DVD store (yes, we still have one). I feel I was robbed. To make a good film you need a strong script, natural dialogue, and people who can act. Just selecting good looking people (that can't act) and then throwing a lot of money at the project gives you this.",3,0,1,6 June 2018
Creed II," Pretty Bland
","I wanted to like this but sadly it was blah blah blah...punch punch... blah blah blah...punch punch punch..the end...(after 2 hours). Look, I wasn't expecting an Oscar winning script here but about 70% of the movie is taken up with Creed's relationship with his wife = blah blah blah...a tad Zzzzz. 5.5/10",5,1,2,16 March 2019
Midway," More Cheese Than A Cheddar Factory
","Good lord this film is bad and I regret paying £3 to rent it. First of all, it's like watching a giant video game. The CGI is quite dodge. Secondly, I just thought this film was rather cheesy and way too patriotic. The best war movies (probably from the 1960s to 80s) had good storytelling, great actors and good drama...The Great Escape, Kelly's Heroes, The Guns of Navarone, The Bridge on the River Kwai and Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence etc. would easily put this cheese fest to shame. Also, why did they hire an English person with a dodgy American accent to play an American hero? I'm English and I spotted his bad accent from the first line of dialogue! 4/10",4,2,2,2 March 2020
Get Him to the Greek," Pretty Bad
","I found this very badly acted, over the top characters and poor dialogue. Not good at all.",4,1,4,13 October 2018
Green Book," Not Bad But Not Oscar Worthy
","This was ok but it was also rather predictable. It ticked a lot of cheesy, stereotypical boxes. It's like there was a checklist to go through where everything had to be ticked off to complete the film. Racist cop, tick. White racist becomes best friend, tick etc. It's not to say it's a bad film, it's just not a great film. A quick internet search turns up information that says a lot of what's in the film isn't actually true anyway. It's worth reading the article 'How 'Green Book' And The Hollywood Machine Swallowed Donald Shirley Whole' for more on this. 6/10 does it for me.",6,1,1,31 May 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Weak
","JW1 is the best. JW3 wasn't bad but having viewed this for a second time tonight, I find it the weakest one of all 3 films. There's no story, it's just punch, kick, shoot, run. 5/10",5,1,1,10 November 2019
Incredibles 2," Slow, boring and disappointing. Shame!
","This film arrived in my local dvd store today (Yup, we still have a dvd store in south London! It's 3 dvds, 2 nights, Â£6/$7.80!) I know the guy who works there. I texted him and said 'mate, hold this film for me, I'll be down in thirty.' And god bless him, he did! Why am I saying this? Well, I was genuinely looking forward to this film. I enjoyed the first film, and the reviews said this was also good. Sadly, it's not. It's slow and the story line is dull. Bottom line is, the script is pants. It takes an age to get anywhere. When it finally picks up a pace, it then flat lines. Overall, it's very bland. The good news is, the end of the film leaves us with a potentially good third installment. The characters are great, the animation is great, just work on that story line peeps! I am a fan. I hope your mob can knock out a great third film!",5,3,9,2 November 2018
Warcraft," Good cheesy fun
","I enjoyed this. Ok, it won't win an Oscar for best film, best screenplay or even best actor lol; however, if you want a film to kick back with, switch off and just go along for the ride with, then this is it. All in all, this was good cheesy fun!",7,1,1,15 June 2018
The Great Gatsby," Visually Great Musically Awful
","We have a 1920s film set to a modern day soundtrack...and it didn't work. The music selection in this film was absolutely bizarre. It turned what could have been a good film into a cartoon style film. Alas, the story line was a tad bland as well, although in fairness, the music didn't help. It's hard to feel empathy for a 1920s character when a hip hop track is blasting underneath them. I felt the story fizzled out towards the end as well due to weak writing. Visually this film is great, it's acted well; however, the music and weak writing turned it into a 5/10 for me.",5,1,2,16 May 2019
Cinderella Man," Wow, what a film!
","I stumbled upon this by pure chance in my local dvd store (yup some do still exist). Somehow, I missed this film when it first came out. Man alive, what a cracking boxing film and true life story this is! It's definitely has to be up there with some of the best boxing films I've ever seen. It's well scripted, directed, acted, has a great true story and by the end of the film, I was swinging punches alongside Russell Crowe lol. Massive thumbs up from me on this one!",9,1,1,5 January 2019
