Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie of the year
","I know that many of you guys hate this movie called Borat. i did not like it either when i watched for the first time, but I watched it again over and over and now i think this movie is amazing. Every single time i watch ii, I find something else funny. i think the idea if the movie is to show the American population what their view is about foreign people or about things outside of the states. for you who did not like Borat, try to watch it again and you will love it because Borat is the funniest movie of the year. I am a movie maniac, this is my hobby and i love it. i've seen worst movies and good movies and when i see someone like Sacha doing all that crazy stuff, i was like that's the man. by the way i think i am going to watch it again tonight! Very NICE!!!!!!Robs",10,2,8,6 July 2007
