The Blair Witch Project," I'm completely torn....
","Well this movie left me totally unsure of how I feel about movies in general.  We are a voyeuristic society, no denying that.  But I am afraid this film crossed the line. While waiting in line to buy tickets for this movie, I asked a cinema staffer if they had been receiving any good reactions to this film.  Her respsonse; 'People who go in thinking the film is real are disappointed, but I saw it the other day and LOVED it!' So when I stumbled out of the theater, thoroughly scared, I had to think back to that comment and wonder what is WRONG WITH PEOPLE?  Had I gone into that movie thinking it was authentic footage I would have come out physically ill.  I don't know how to judge this movie.  It was some of the most excellent acting I have ever seen...leading people to believe, I'm sure that it is real.  And the dialogue was tremendous, the most realistic that I've ever been witness to...but does that mean I recommend it?  I can't tell yet.  I saw it over a week ago, but I'm still not sure how I feel.  Yes, it is an incredible piece of work.  But are we, as a society, crossing the line of voyeurism and taking it too far?  What is the difference between this and a snuff film? Watching something you are led to believe is real, or in fact, is real... I don't know if I should just applaud the  sculpted work that it is, but I can't help wishing people wouldn't indulge in a movie like this.",8,1,1,26 July 1999
Life Is Beautiful," A sparkling triumph for Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami!
","This is a film that translates into the heart of any viewer, whether it is seen in it's original Italian, with subtitles, or even without!  It demonstrates beautifully the strength of the spirit as an Italian family copes with the realities of WWII.  Roberto Benigni shines in his best film to date!  Nicoletta Braschi amazes us once again, and who could ever forget the face of little Giosue?  An epic film, easily one of the finest films of the decade!  10/10!",10,1,2,30 June 1999
The Red Violin," An amazing finished product!
","I went to see this film at my sister's request, dubious of it before I even knew what it was about.  But sitting in the audience, awash with so many languages, it quickly grabbed my attention.  With a background in Italian and a little bit of knowledge of German, I was happy to read sub-titles as it switched from generation to generation.  It is all tied together leading you from one century to the next, then back again. Surprisingly the unknown actors in the film were wonderful, while the 'stars' left something to be desired.  That aside, I eagerly agreed to see it a second time with a friend, and really got even more out of it.  It is written well, and is a first (for me!) in it's multilingual script. Though the feature was Canadian, it easily could have been Italian, Chinese, British, or German.  I love the concept.  9/10",10,0,0,5 August 1999
