Hereditary," Slow movie and not an horror film!
","This movie is called an horror film but I don't consider it that way. Maybe a thriller or suspense movie. If you are waiting for a good scare you will waste your time, you will get the sense of tense/stress while watching this movie but if you are looking for 'the horror film of the year' as many reviewers and critics say you better save your bucks and find other movie.It starts slow and takes a lot of time to develop all the idea; to finally deliver a bad end in about the last 10 minutes of the movie.Great acting and even a nice movie plot but it just doesn't deliver.I blame the critics and all the marketing for so much hype around this film. Great movie trailer, lots of awesome reviews but It is just another different movie in which all the smart arguments get lost with how it ends. I felt really disappointed.Horror film fans beware!!",3,3,6,14 June 2018
