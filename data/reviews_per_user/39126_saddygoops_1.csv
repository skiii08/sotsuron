Skyfall," Not what it used to be.............
","I being a huge fan of the Bond series was not satisfied by the new addition, 'SKYFALL'. It was nothing special but lacked a lot from the usual bond movies. Bond movies are supposed to have a casual (NSA) feel to them, with a lot of action, cool gadgets, glamour and punch lines. This movie lacked seriously in the last three categories.Javier Bardem was under used, his character vaguely reminded of 'The Joker' but never reached that caliber. For a 2 1/2 hr film it certainly failed to built up characters and often went on to question about Bond's Past and his potential or the lack of it. By bringing in the personal touch it started to resemble the Bourne or the M.I. series.Spoiler Alert: Things got a little too personal, instead of it being about saving the world the story was about two agents (one from the past and one current) fighting about M's affection and loyalty to her agents.Anyway, being partial to bond movies i would still rate it worthy of 6.5 stars and a must one-time see, for all the lovers of this genre.",4,3,15,6 February 2013
