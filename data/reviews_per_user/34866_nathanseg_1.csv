Come and See," When films impact History
","Films such as' Come and See' can mark people's mind to the point of affecting a government's decision; thus it wouldn't be surprising if Klimov's brutal, breathtaking, and above all, truthful depiction of atrocities committed during the last World War influenced the Soviet leaders not to enter into a third World War at the time the movie was made. Klimov provides a sample of the horrors committed by the Nazis on Soviet civilians during their invasion; the dreadful experience of watching the film is fueled by Klimov's unsettling, but effective, mise en scene shaped by a Soviet approach to film making. Indeed, in order to reproduce historical events in a realist manner, Klimov has used unorthodox, but highly efficient methods, such as shooting animals or hypnotizing the main actor. The heritage of Soviet cinematographic philosophy is also present in a scene in which an ominous bird walks around the two young characters before the arrival of the Nazis; previous Soviet filmmaker such as Eisenstein understood that metaphorical images –such as a dreadful bird or the accidental crush of eggs –had as much impact on the audience as details advancing the plot. 'Come and See' is particularly relevant to people considering joining the army or any person in favor of declaring war to another nation. Florya's experience is representative of what could be anyone's journey through war. First, the boy is excited at the idea of participating and has a glorified image of combat. Although he sets his mind to engage in battle, it is war that comes to him. Klimov shows us that, during War time, no component of one's life is spared: family, friendship, romantic love, even leadership are all pulverized by the atrocities of war. Thus, his mother and sisters are assassinated; his new comrades are killed by mines and sub gun machines; Glasha –like the second girl appearing in the film –is probably raped; even Kossach is haunted by atrocious nightmares. As horrendous scenes unfold, the public cannot help but to ask: why such inhuman behavior? It is towards the end that Kossach, looking 'through' the audience, tells us to 'listen attentively'. The answer comes from a Nazi who makes us understand that German treatments were devoid of humanity for the unconceivable, yet simple, reason that they did not see certain people –the communists in that case- as fellow human beings. Symbolically, the last shot going upward starting from the bottom of the trees comes in contrast with the first shot of the trees going downward starting from the top ; these opposite camera movements contrast the Nazi invasion with the Soviet riposte. Indeed, the German soldiers were ordered by their leader to 'come down' on the Soviet Union whereas the Soviet's counterattack is orchestrated by common men –such as Florya –eager to defeat the invaders –with the help from the blessed Russian snow, falling –in the last shot –in a holistic manner on the lens.",10,3,3,27 July 2011
