The Benchwarmers," a few good chuckles
","Well, the Benchwarmers did not fail as miserably as i would have thought. The storyline was completely insane but that was to be expected. The blend of actors went really well together. I really did not need to see another Jon Heder reprise of Napoleon Dynamite. Oh well, win some lose some. Overall the humor comes from Jon Lovitz' role in the movie. Probably one of the coolest roles in movie history. He really saves the movie in my eyes. There were other laughable parts in the movie. Mainly crude low brow humor, but funny all the same. Worth a watch? Yes, but owning this one may be for hardcore fans of the actors in the movie. This movie is either foul or fair ... you make the call.",5,0,0,21 August 2006
Silent Hill," impressed but not in awe
","I really believe what saved this movie for me is the fact that i am a huge fan of the video games. Don't get me wrong, Silent Hill would be a good movie anyhow but to someone who is not familiar with the games may have trouble following the movie. A lot of the camera angles and of course the music were so true to the game that i was smiling greatly. The special effects were top notch. I was impressed with the Colin monster. Very cool. No real scares or jolts in this one though. It delivered on the big budget feel, though. At least Silent Hill had a fair shake at being done right. It wouldn't be the same if it was done on a low budget. Or with mediocre actors. I tip my hat to the Silent Hill crew. Now if we could only get a good Resident Evil movie i would be happy.",7,0,1,20 August 2006
