Iron Man 3," what an awful movie
","there was a moment near during the end where I honestly considered walking out of the theater.. it's.. it's that bad. They did THAT with the mandarin?! and the story?! the time-line?! the plot?! just.. awful! holy crap i never thought i'd say this from a 'summer blockbuster' movie but i felt like walking out of the movie it was simply horrid.when the 'twist' happened and I sat there thinking they bastardized the characters.. what is this?! what the bloody hell is going on?! and i'm hoping it picks up but it simply does not. Plot is non-existent, the characters are dull, boring and lifeless and really the only salvation this movie has if any is the chemistry and rapport between Robert and Gwyneth! I honestly think they did this movie for one reason and one reason only.. to showcase the 'Iron Man Armory' because this is one of the worst 'summer blockbuster' movies ever made",4,6,12,2 May 2013
Joker," in this mad world, only the mad are sane
",What an unforgettable experience this movie was.. the last movie i saw that had 'must experience' all over it was 'A Quiet Place'.. if you ever saw that in the movies you'd know what I mean sitting there in a completely full theatre and yet you could hear a pin drop from the silence.. JOKER is right up there with the greatest movies of all-time with one of the greatest performances ever by Mr. Phoenix. Anyone else wins best actor and we know the ceremonies are rigged he was THAT good! Can't wait until this comes out in 4K not only is it insta-watch in the movies but it's also insta-grab to add to the collection! BRAVO!,10,20,46,3 September 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," THE Trilogy of MY Lifetime
","Past Generations have had The Godfather, Star Wars.. I've even seen the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy.. but for my lifetime (I am 33yrs old now).. Nothing beats Christopher Nolan's Batman! I'm sure others will throw every superlative word or compliment they can think of at The Dark Knight Rises but the only thing I can say is it is truly a fantastic experience and this is THE Trilogy of my generation! Do yourself a favor, if you are wary of 'Summer Blockbusters'.. go and watch The Dark Knight Rises and if you haven't before.. follow it up with Batman Begins and then The Dark KnightMovies like these come seldom in a generation, you owe it to yourself! :) thank you Mr. Nolan, thank you!",10,3,7,20 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," 2nd Best CBM ever behind The Dark Knight
","The greatest movie I have ever seen remains The Dark Knight.. but Batman vs Superman is a close 2nd and in some ways betters it. How so? Simple.. this is the greatest Batman portrayal EVER. I have seen almost all of the Batman movies and nobody.. NOBODY's Batman comes close to Ben Affleck's. Keep in mind I'm talking strictly Batman and not Bruce Wayne.This is how Batman is and should be.. in a word: SAVAGE. I have enjoyed every minute and the 2.5 hour runtime did not feel it because of the great story and characters. Splurge and treat yourselves. Go to the movies, let yourself be taken to their world for a few hours. Only when you yawn hours after the movie will you understand the magic and energy you've been a part of! Can't wait for the Bluray.. def going to get the extra length cut!",10,4,8,27 March 2016
