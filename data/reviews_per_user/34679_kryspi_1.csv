The Lobster," Orwellian master piece!!!
","Yorgos Lanthimos you sir are a very talented writer and director. The lobster is one of those movies that leave you scratching your head going wtf!!! The story has been beautifully stitched together with extremely interesting concepts and equally awkward characters. Through out the movie i couldn't help but feel there was a certain homage to Orwell. The room the main character (David) stays in at the hotel is 101 which in 1984 was the room for re-programming. There is even a hint of animal farm in there as well with all the crazy animals appearing in certain scenes(including a huge pig). As far as dystopian movies go this has become one of my new favorites!!! Production on this film also needs a mention as the lighting, settings and tone of the movie, all play an integral part in painting the bleak picture of this possible reality!!!",10,2,9,5 January 2016
