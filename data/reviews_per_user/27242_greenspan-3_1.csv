Iron Man 3," awful!
","In a post-credits scene set sometime after his operation, Stark is recounting his story to a now-sleeping Dr. Bruce Banner. Woken up, Banner admits to falling asleep at the beginning of Stark's story. This simply sums up the whole 'iron man 3' movie, it is a shame that terrible, awful scenario made it to big screen as iron man 3 and single handedly kill the franchise it may be well suited for any action or super hero since we hardly see the iron man in his suit. the studios choice to use the name of the franchise and not to care what the movie says about the franchise(its characters, universe and to fans)has resulted in this major disaster. i am sure only mention the name 'iron man' profited this time, but the audience will think twice before to see a two and a half hours travesty next time. so i hope, if the producers are considering a fourth one, they better find a hell of a plot and a writing team for not to make audience fell asleep on their seats as dr. benner did.",1,2,6,24 August 2013
