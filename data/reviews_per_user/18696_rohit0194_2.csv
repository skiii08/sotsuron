The Avengers," THE best film of 2012 so far..............
","There's a belief nowadays that superhero movies need to be dark and gritty(like The Dark Knight).... well The Avengers goes against the tide and comes out shining..... for Marvel's latest movie team up is nothing short of epic... with the right balance of action(Helicarrier battle, the thrilling NYC climax) and humor(I still can't get the Hulk-Loki confrontation out of my mind :D)......... All the actors are at their best.... The direction is deft and the story is solid... My favourite Avengers were definitely the Hulk(the way he 'hulks out' during the climax is pretty awesome)... and Hawkeye(who knew shooting arrows could look so cool??) Every character gets his moment to shine.. which is a great job in a film with so many characters.. Hats Off!!! Its not like its flawless... it feels sort of fluffy and also could have been longer... but i guess that's me.. But all that takes a backseat as director Joss Whedon gives us THE best film of the year so Far.... All in all .....The Avengers Is a MUST WATCH!!!!!!",9,2,6,1 May 2012
Pacific Rim," Good, but could have been great...
","The Good:Superb action (The best so far this year) and Groundbreaking VFX. The director, to his credit, makes awesome use of the technology available and makes us feel every Punch and blows traded between the scary kaijus and the *huge* jaegers (seriously, they make the transformers look like toys)Great acting by Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and of course, Ron PerlmanEpic background scoreThe Bad:The lead character is not that well portrayed and his motivations are weak and his arc is not given justice. The two scientist types are super annoyingThe movie is full of clich√©s, which really shouldn't have been the case For a movie which looks this good.In summary,Pacific Rim is better than the blockbusters which have released this year. It promises epic action, and delivers it in spades. But for those who are looking for something extra, it disappoints.Pacific Rim is by no means a bad movie, but it could have been so much better...7.5/10",8,1,6,12 July 2013
