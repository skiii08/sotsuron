Hereditary," Intense
",I watched this movie yesterday and I was pleased. This is a movie that is scary without jumpscares! The acting was great! There are some tense moments like when Charlie dies and the ending! The only problem I had was that there wasn't much story told behind the family and the King Of Hell. It is a good horror film. Cluck.8/10,8,6,14,10 June 2018
A Quiet Place," It was awesome!
","A Quiet Place takes survival to a whole new level. I saw it last night at Battery Park and I was impressed. Not many horror movies are that good any more
After the main characters found the weakness. The sad part is that we don't know if the characters killed them all or not. I am sure they did. 
I rate it 8 Stars! I would really recommend it!",8,3,5,15 April 2018
