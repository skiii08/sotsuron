Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Maniacal Laugh-Riot!!
","Borat is loud, vulgar, culturally insensitive, racist, sexist, crazy but ultimately a ridiculously hilarious 84-minute movie that might be one of the funniest movies ever made. The eccentric title character is played by Sacha Baron Cohen.Borat hails from Kazakhstan and works as a television reporter. He is sent to the USA in order to learn from their culture and incorporate the things that he learns during his visit.Due to the incredibly hilarious opening scene, the main problem with the movie lies in maintaining its level of hilarity. There are a lot of moments which might disgust some viewers and it is definitely not a movie for those who cannot stomach some disturbing imagery.Sacha Baron Cohen, the British comedian, also helped in shaping the character and in writing many of his own dialogs. It is a splendid performance and he deserved the Golden Globe that was bestowed upon him.Borat starts off with a lot of promise, but the second half of the movie fails to match the level that was shown in the beginning. However, due to its short runtime, Borat is great if you are looking for something funny with a limited time.",8,0,0,8 August 2015
Requiem for a Dream," A Unique Cinematic Experience
","Well, this movie has style, whether it is the fast cuts, split screens or the fantasy sequences, the director manages to weave it all in despite being a low budget movie. I watched Requiem For a Dream after watching Black Swan, also directed by Darren Aronofsky. I must say that this is one of the best psychological movies you will ever see. An elderly woman receives an opportunity to appear on television due to which she decides to lose some weight in order to appear beautiful on air. As dieting fails to deliver results, she decides to go to a 'doctor' who gives her pills that will magically reduce her weight. What she doesn't realize is that the pills are probably drugs that will not benefit her in the long run. Although the movie is filmed on a meagre budget, it has a brilliant cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Ellen Burstyn gives a truly mesmerizing performance which probably deserved an Oscar. The soundtrack is spectacular and the main theme is one of the most widely used tunes in sports videos. This is the kind of movie that will make you believe in the power of good filmmaking.",10,1,2,22 June 2015
Captain Phillips," A Solid Thriller
","The premise of this movie is based on the real-life story of Captain Phillips. It involves the invasion of the ship by Somali pirates who are looking to make a quick buck. Here, they capture Tom Hanks and use him as a hostage in order to get their money. The acting is pretty realistic and Tom Hanks is memorable as he is able to display the raw emotions of a survivor. The US Navy is shown quite professionally which makes the story much more credible. The movie is well-shot and visually it has a gritty look. The young Somali actor deserves credit for having a brilliant screen presence and giving an authentic portrayal of pirates. Most of the movie involves negotiations between the three pirates, who had taken Captain Phillips as their hostage, and the officials of the US Navy whose objective is to bring back Captain Phillips and not allow the pirates to escape. The movie is quite exciting and worth a watch.",9,0,2,8 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is How You Ruin a Franchise
","The Phantom Menace was atrocious. It was a pain to sit through the duration of the movie which was just a little over 2 hours. George Lucas returned as the director previously having directed the first movie of Star Wars, i.e, A New Hope. He was simply not up to the task and made some terrible choices in this movie. There are certain creatures who are weirdly shaped and talk even more strangely and I won't even bother to look up to know what they are actually called. This was an unnecessary addition which did not help in moving the story forward and only managed to irritate the viewers. The reason for the long duration between the last Star Wars movie to the current one was because George Lucas didn't believe that the special effects technology had advanced enough to fulfill the vision that he had for this movie. There was nothing groundbreaking about the special effects. Frankly, the visual effects of the original trilogy was far more original and well-implemented than what they achieved in this movie. The acting was below par despite having a talented cast comprising of Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. The movie focuses on a young Anakin Skywalker as he is spotted by the Jedi Knights and is selected to be trained. The movie is a complete snooze-fest and I wouldn't have bothered on watching this if it wasn't for the Episode VII which is going to come out later this movie. Avoid this movie if you can as it did not do much to move the plot forward.",3,1,5,27 June 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Quintessential Action-Adventure Movie!!
","This is one of the most influential and exciting movies that has ever been made. There are a number of classic scenes in this thrilling, including the boulder that chases Indiana, the fight on top of a bus and another classic scene that I will not reveal in this review as it will reduce the impact of that scene. Raiders of The Lost Ark focuses on Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist professor in a college and is also an avid explorer of historical artifacts. The Lost Ark is of great significance and its discovery is something that the Nazis are after as a gift to the Fuhrer. Indiana Jones and his team embark upon a mission to locate this ark and return it to America where its hidden secrets might be uncovered.As the movie focuses on the plot, the acting is not something that is given much focus. Harrison Ford stars as Indiana Jones who is a cool, charismatic guy who has a way of overcoming any obstacle that comes in his way. The movie is one that must not be missed due to the brilliant direction, tight editing and spectacularly filmed action sequences. A must watch for all.",10,1,2,3 July 2015
Casablanca," A Timeless Romance
","Before watching this movie, I have seen Casablanca mentioned as one of the greatest movies ever made. I had huge expectations for this movie and after watching it I can see why it is such a widely loved movie. Set in the backdrop of World War 2, the story revolves around Rick who is the owner of a gin joint in Casablanca. The dialogs are what truly make this movie memorable as a number of them have become fixtures of popular culture. The acting is marvelous and Humphrey Bogart is exceptional as a man with a broken heart who is a sentimentalist. Even though the movie is very old, the themes of love and heartbreak still resonate in the present day. I believe people can enjoy this masterpiece for centuries to come.",9,0,1,29 May 2015
Minority Report," This Science Fiction is surprisingly realistic!!
","Steven Spielberg has made numerous memorable movies in his illustrious career. Minority Report is one of his finest. The complex plot might confuse the average viewer but that does not take away the magnificence of this movie. In 2054, an organization called Precrime tries to prevent future crimes from taking place with the help of Precogs. Does it sound complicated? Well, it is. However, the central theme of this movie is how Tom Cruise's character deals with the world on knowing that his son is probably dead. There are a number of futuristic devices in this film which have been replicated in real life and many of them may become a reality in the coming years. Multi-Touch, Retina Sensors, Spider cams are a few of the many devices that are presented in this movie. This thrilling movie goes by in a breeze and for that the credit must go to the director for giving the story a nice pace. The performances are spot-on and even the secondary characters with small roles perform brilliantly. I would say that this movie must be seen.",9,0,1,1 June 2015
John Wick," A decent thriller with undefined motives
","Keanu Reeves stars as the badass hit-man who happens to kill dozens of people in order to avenge the death of his dog that was gifted by his recently deceased wife. The action is slick and in some ways is reminiscent of Taken in the manner of the deaths. Throughout the movie, the motive behind the action of John Wick is not clear. He basically does all the killings in order to take revenge for his dog and his stolen car. It does not make much sense which is why it is hard to understand what the screenwriters were thinking while writing. The performances of Keanu Reeves is understated and a tad bit disappointing. The short runtime makes it easy to watch but the absurd plot will not please the people who are looking for a smart, ingenious thriller. Please leave your brains at home before watching this movie.",6,0,2,30 May 2015
The Big Lebowski," His Dudeness is Great!!!
","The Coen Brothers have a unique sense of humor which they incorporate in every one of their movies. The Big Lebowski features Jeff Bridges in the leading role of 'The Dude' or 'His Dudeness' or 'El Duderino', whatever you like better. Easily one of the coolest movie characters ever created, 'The Dude' is an unemployed guy who passes his time by playing bowling and does not give a damn about what others think of him. There happens to be another Lebowski who is a millionaire, so a couple of guys mistake the dude for him when they are looking for a payoff. Now, the eccentric plot revolves around how 'The Dude' manages to deliver a million dollars to the kidnappers of The Lebowski's wife, that is the millionaire Lebowski.The movie is filled with incredibly hilarious dialogues and some outrageous actions by the characters. The cinematography is fantastic and there are certain dream sequences which have been captured magnificently. The Big Lebowski has all the ingredients that are required for being a classic that will be remembered for decades to come. If you want a truly exhilarating cinematic experience, then go ahead and watch this movie now.",9,3,5,1 July 2015
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A Feel Good Movie that gives an Ephemeral feeling of ecstasy!!
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is an above average romantic comedy that surprisingly manages to add something new to this perennially clichéd genre. The film features an ensemble cast comprising of immensely talented actors like Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling and a few others. The insane plot gets a jolt when Emily (Julianne Moore) decides to get a divorce with Cal (Steve Carell) due to suffering a mid-life crisis. As Cal is heartbroken from the sudden development, he decides to rediscover his manhood by learning how to pick up girls from Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who he meets at a bar. Now, there is a crazy scene near the end of the movie when all the characters get in a heated altercation after learning about the crushes that have been developed by certain characters for each other. I believe the final 15 minutes kind of ruin the movie as it involves a cheesy scene in which Cal hints that he still loves his wife and would love to have her back. After the sequence of events leading up to this scene, it feels like the filmmakers could have given us a more offbeat ending that would do justice to the overall tone of the movie. Apart from a few blemishes, most of the movie is hilarious due to some good acting and intelligent dialog. A heart-warming tale epitomizes the main plot of Crazy, Stupid, Love. It is definitely worth a watch.",8,0,1,19 July 2015
Oldboy," Dark, Twisted and Brilliant!!
","Before seeing this movie, I had come across Oldboy in a number of lists where it was mentioned as one of the most violent and disturbing films you will ever see. On that count, it does not disappoint. It is a chilling depiction of a man who has been imprisoned for 15 years without knowing the reason for this punishment. The performance of Chao Min Sik is absolutely phenomenal. By portraying Oh Dae-Su, he completely owns the role and shows the desperation and want for revenge effortlessly. This is not a film for the weak-hearted as it contains several scenes of graphic violence which can't be handled by everyone. A must-watch for all cinema-lovers, this one can definitely rival the best movies that have come out of Asia. Apart from the disturbing imagery that is omnipresent in this movie, it's hard to find any flaw in this masterpiece which might go down in history as one of the best. A must watch.",9,2,4,21 May 2015
Juno," Ellen Page can act!!!
","The first time that I saw Ellen Page was in Inception and she did not make much of an impression in that movie. In Juno, she proves what she is capable of when given a promising script with a strong character. Juno completely belongs to her and the free-spirited, open-minded Juno is perfectly depicted by Ellen Page. At the beginning of the movie, Juno finds out that she is pregnant. Instead of being alarmed, she tries to go for an abortion but could not go through with it. Eventually, she decides to keep the baby and give it to a couple for adoption. Juno has an underlying message about giving life. What makes the movie stand out is the use of colloquial language and slangs which correctly depict the present world. The movie goes by in a breeze and I must say that it was a wonderful experience. Don't miss it.",9,0,1,27 May 2015
X-Men," One of The Better Superhero Movies!!
","X-Men is a title that is given for a bunch of mutants who have various superpowers ranging from reading others minds to self- healing. The movie exceeded my expectations as it did not feature too much action and had just the right amount of character development and emphasis on plot.The movie features a stellar cast comprising of veteran actors like Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. Hugh Jackman made his Hollywood debut in this movie and his gritty role as Wolverine is one of the reasons why he is one of the biggest movie stars today.All the aspects of the movie gel together to give us a complete entertainment package that does not verge towards being pretentious or silly. The primary antagonist is Magneto (Ian McKellen) whose aim is to obtain Marie (Anna Paquin) and use her mutant powers, through which she can leech out the powers of another person through physical touch, to transfer his own powers to her in order to power the machine that artificially induced mutation.Due to its short runtime of 104 minutes, the film flies by and the result is a satisfying, ingenious piece of work that does justice to the Marvel Comics on which it is based. Also, the special effects are exhilarating to watch and are not excessive unlike some of the modern superhero movies.",9,0,0,17 July 2015
Midnight in Paris," A Great Script backed by a stellar Cast
","Midnight in Paris is the first Woody Allen movie that I have seen. The film is set in Paris where Gil and Inez, who are engaged, have come to visit Inez's parents. The city is shown in its full glory through some beautiful cinematography and a background score that complements the movie well. The cast is stellar with Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams in the lead roles. The movie also consists of Oscar winners Adrien Brody and Marion Cotillard in Supporting roles. The best aspect of the movie was the script which is highly original that shows Gil go back to a different era every midnight. On viewing the movie, the characters seem completely realistic and it never feels like anyone is acting as all the performances are natural. Throughout the movie, the director hints at the dissonance between the soon to be married couple. The interpretation to the fantasy world that Gil enters is not resolved. It is left to the viewer to make out what really happens. As the movie is a romantic comedy, it has certain aspects that are common to the genre. The sense of humor in this movie comes mainly through Owen Wilson who tries to explain how he goes back to a different era every midnight despite the disbelief of her fiancée. The movie is short and well edited which makes for a memorable experience.",9,0,0,13 June 2015
The Prestige," A Mind-Bending Psychological Thriller!!
","The Prestige is just one of the many Nolan movies that prove that he is one of the true cinematic geniuses in the world. A period film that is based on the life of two magicians, The Prestige, has all the ingredients that are necessary to challenge the viewers perception on what is truly happening. It has a narrative that is non-linear which makes it hard to pin down and fully understand the plot.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale star as the two magicians who are obsessed with proving the world who the better magician is. Both of them give charismatic, spellbinding performances that illustrate the depth of their rivalry and unyielding desire to perfect their craft.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors in the world and the entire movie has his stamp of authority and he is in control of every aspect of the film. Even after a couple of viewings, it is difficult to fully understand the complicated plot.One aspect of the film that just does not live up to the standard is the music. It never manages to reach the heights that the cinematography had scaled. Apart from this, I would say that the only limitation that Nolan has is constructing strong female characters with substantial roles. In this movie as well, there is not much scope for the actresses to do something unique with their roles.However, if you are looking for a smartly made movie that constantly challenges the viewer and demands repeat viewing, then The Prestige will fulfill your needs.",9,0,1,28 July 2015
The Terminator," An influential classic!!
","The Terminator is one of the most popular and well-known science fiction movies ever made. The film is quite well-paced and provides thrills throughout its runtime. Even though the special effects might not dazzle the people who are watching in 2015, they must have been quite impressive at the time it was released. The story involves a Terminator that is a Cyborg sent back into time to terminate Sarah Connor. The titular Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who has minimal dialogs in this movie but is able to portray the ruthless demeanor of the emotionless cyborg perfectly. The film does not dwell too deep into the technicalities of time-travel but the action scenes make up for its plot holes. The director James Cameron rose to fame following the success of this movie and that is because the movie is timeless. A must watch!!!",9,1,1,10 June 2015
Knocked Up," A Crazy, Hilarious Comedy!!!
","Knocked Up is a straight-out comedy with a hilarious screenplay that is filled with cultural references. The premise of the story is that two people hook up one night and it leads to an unwanted pregnancy. Due to the unwillingness of the mother to part with her baby, the two of them decide to give a shot at having an actual relationship which is what we see in the rest of the movie.Ben (Seth Rogen) is a slacker with no job who hangs around with a bunch of like-minded friends whose only ambition in life is to get high. Alison (Katherine Heigl) is the complete opposite of Ben with a settled life as an entertainment news reporter. Even though both of them cannot have more distinct personalities, they somehow manage to make things work.There is a wonderful support cast featuring Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and Jason Segel. All of the characters are well developed with Paul Rudd being exceptionally good. The minor hiccup in the movie is the development of Alison who is a contradiction. The story does take a lot of liberties when characters make some terrible judgments. However, as this is a comedy movie, we can cut the filmmakers some slack.Knocked Up manages to deal with the subject amiably without getting too preachy. If you want to enjoy a few laughs and see some terrific comedy actors, then this is the movie for you.",9,0,2,1 August 2015
Life of Pi," A Visual Spectacle
","Ang Lee is well-known for making movies that deal with human emotions like love, loss of life, and faith. Life of Pi is the story of a boy who survived a shipwreck with no company except that of a ferocious Bengal Tiger. The story is moving and it is told through flashbacks as Irrfan Khan narrates it to an author who is keen to turn this story into his next novel. The film features some of the best visuals and the use of 3D brings out the best of the surroundings. Suraj Sharma, who had no prior acting experience, is pretty decent in his debut and is able to convey the emotions of losing his family excellently. Even though a Tiger is a carnivorous animal that can kill humans, Pi and the tiger develop a sort of symbiotic relationship which enabled them to survive. The unlikely relationship is portrayed quite well by the director and it is truly like nothing you would have ever seen. The music is inspired by Traditional Indian Music and complements the movie well. It tends to get overly sentimental at times which is an element that could have been avoided. However, do watch the movie for its breathtaking visuals.",8,0,2,8 June 2015
American Sniper," A Brutal Look at War!!
","American Sniper, helmed by director Clint Eastwood is the biopic of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in U.S. History. The film deals with the aftermath of 9/11 and the extensive measures that were taken by the Americans to prevent terror attacks by sending troops to Iraq and Afghanistan.Bradley Cooper plays the lead role of a SEAL and he is thoroughly believable due to the nuanced performance that he delivers. As the conditions in which he lives in the U.S. and Iraq are completely disparate, he finds it hard to adjust to regular life after experiencing the atrocious conditions of war. Even though he makes four separate trips to Iraq, he is still not satisfied with his achievements and longs for helping more of his fellow soldiers.The director does a pretty good job at vividly showcasing the brutal, egregious acts of the militants. As it deals with the war in Iraq, it has certain similarities to another war movie, The Hurt Locker. American Sniper is a moving, honest look at the life of a great human. I don't believe that this movie was good enough to be an Oscar contender but is still a fairly decent war flick.",8,5,8,1 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An Improvement over A Phantom Menace but not too great!
","Attack of The Clones is thankfully an improvement over its atrocious predecessor. However, there were still a lot of problems in the script and some casting decisions. This movie is set 10 years after the events of the previous one. Hayden Christensen plays the crucial role of Anakin Skywalker. His childish and petulant demeanor undermine the character that he is portraying. Considering the fact that Anakin Skywalker will become the omnipotent Darth Vader, I believe a better actor could have been chosen for this iconic character. Anakin Skywalker, who has become a Jedi is assigned to protect Senator Padme (Natalie Portman). Their hardly any chemistry between the two actors and hence the attempt to portray a romance between them fails miserably.There are a lot of unnecessary characters like Jar Jar Binks, who is a constant source of disturbance. A tighter plot would have served the movie better. John Williams is the composer and gives us a moving score.Even though both this movie is decent, it still lacks in quality when compared to the original trilogy. I would say that this is certainly a movie that is worth your time if you don't focus too much on the minor distractions that are present throughout the movie.",7,3,7,25 July 2015
The Bourne Identity," Not your average action thriller!!
","The Bourne Identity is a spy thriller which, on the surface, is strikingly similar in premise to the James Bond series. However, as the movie commences and gathers momentum, it becomes strikingly clear that the filmmakers have strived to make this movie a lot more focused on the characters and the plot. Even though there is enough action to satisfy the genre fans, the intelligent way in which the story is presented gives us a unique perspective on the life of the lead character.Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, is a CIA agent who was sent to perform a certain task in Europe. At the beginning of the movie, Bourne is unable to recall his identity or the purpose of his mission. As the viewers are also unaware of this, it allows us to see the world from his point of view. I believe that this generates a much greater impact than knowing beforehand the identity of Jason Bourne.For the majority of the movie, Jason Bourne struggles to remember anything about his past which is well executed by Matt Damon's acting. The CIA plan to capture him and the whole movie is essentially a battle between Jason Bourne and the CIA.Technically, all aspects of the movie is quite impressive. A car chase sequence, in particular, is pulled off with consummate skill. Due to a run-time of just over two hours, the movie keeps you hooked and the strong writing enables the film to never lose traction.I would highly recommend watching this movie as it is not a mere caricature of some other well-known spy thrillers. Instead, it is a unique story told by a talented director which has all the elements that are necessary for a timeless classic.",10,5,6,24 September 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," No Hogwarts. No Problems.
","The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the first Harry Potter movie that is not set in Hogwarts as Harry Potter is on a quest to find and destroy all the Horcruxes. This does not dissipate the excitement and in fact it has improved the story as the main characters are not bound by anything.As this is a two part movie, the first movie acts as a set up to the final movie due to which the ending seems unresolved which may by disappointing for some. However, most of the movie builds up to a crescendo which will likely be ending with a rousing climax in the second part.The acting is wonderful as all the lead characters return for this film. Due to the increasing difficulty in making any progress, Ron gets extremely frustrated and even leaves Harry and Hermione only to return later. Other Technical Aspects of this film is solid as usual. As the director is the same as that for the previous two films, it makes it much easier to work in a world that has already been developed vividly. After watching this movie, I cannot wait for the second movie. I would suggest to everyone to watch the two parts back to back as it will deliver the greatest amount of satisfaction.",9,0,2,15 July 2015
Hugo," Heartwarming, Breathtaking, Beautiful: An Unusual Scorsese Flick!!
","Martin Scorsese has built his illustrious career by making films about gangsters and organized crime. However, in this movie, Scorsese makes a family film without any profanity, violence or deadly characters. He manages to prove everyone that he is a great filmmaker who can be versatile in his choice of projects.Hugo is set in Paris during the 1930s. Interestingly, both the lead characters are played by child actors. To say that they have done a good job would be a huge understatement. Both the child actors manage to deliver splendid performances in front of seasoned actors and bring great depth in the portrayal of their characters.The beautiful and rich score by Howard shore brings a dreamlike feel to the movie. There is a certain innocence in this movie that is hard to find in most of the movies.This film features some of the best production design and cinematography that I have seen in a movie. In many ways, this film can also be seen as Scorsese's tribute to cinema which can influence the lives of so many people.The unique quality possessed by this movie is its ability to stay in your mind long after watching the movie. The compelling story will resonate with most people. I hope that Hugo will stand the test of time and after a few decades be seen as a masterpiece which it is.",9,1,2,14 July 2015
Warrior," An Emotional Roller Coaster!!
","Warrior does not strive to be something unique or differ from the template that has been set for sports movies. Even though the story is quite predictable and similar to some other boxing movies like The Fighter, it is the realization of the drama that is gripping. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is an ex-marine who decides to go into the ring in order to enter a winner takes all tournament named Sparta and give the prize money that he receives to the widow of his fellow comrade in war. His brother, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is struggling to make ends meet due to which he decides that he will start training again in order to avoid getting evicted from his home.The acting is sensational, with Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, in particular, giving brutally realistic performances that are able to showcase the trauma and emotions that these characters have undergone.The movie focuses on Mixed Martial Arts, and the choreography of the fight scenes is done excellently with encouraging results. It is easily one of the best sports movies that I have seen.One aspect that sets this movie apart is just how every sequence is integral due to which it is impossible to look away from the screen. The acclaim that the movie has received is well-deserved and fans of the genre will love it.",10,1,3,27 July 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Hasta la Vista, Baby
","This is the ultimate action science fiction movie. There have been many imitators of this masterpiece, however, none of them come close to replicating the sheer brilliance of this flick by James Cameron. It is not very often that you see a sequel surpass the original in terms of quality. Terminator 2 improves upon every aspect such as storytelling, acting and special effects. It was one of the most expensive movies made at that time and the elaborate sets and the innovative visual effects were possible due to the huge budget. This movie focuses on John Connor who is depicted wonderfully by Edward Furlong. A terminator is sent to terminate John Connor who is supposed to be the future leader of the war against machines. In the original movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the antagonist, however, in this movie he is entitled with the job to protect John Connor. All the actors give terrific performances that elevates this movie to another level altogether. Even after 30 years, this movie still feels fresh and it will remain a fan-favorite for years to come. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",10,2,4,16 June 2015
We're the Millers," A Thoroughly Enjoyable Fare!
","We're The Millers is a comedy that is not meant to be taken seriously. It features Jason Sudekis in the lead role of a small- time drug dealer and Jennifer Aniston as a stripper. Now, this guy gets the opportunity to go to Mexico and smuggle some drugs to the United States in exchange for 100 Grand. David undertakes this risky mission and realizes that he will be less suspicious if he went to Mexico with a family.To form his fake family, he hires Rose the stripper, his teenage neighbor and a homeless girl who reluctantly agrees to be a part of this mission for 1000 dollars. The fake family is disguised as The Millers.For the majority of the movie, we follow the crazy, reckless adventures that involve threats to their lives by drug cartels. The film derives its humor from the conversations that the characters have with each other.We're The Millers has its flaws but it works as it does not try to be anything other than what it is, that is, a mindless comedy. If you can ignore some of the plot holes in this story, you will surely enjoy this enjoyable movie.",9,0,1,10 July 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," No one does thriller as well as David Fincher
","If you have seen David Fincher's previous movies you should know what to expect. However, this one is probably one of the best thriller/mystery movie that you will ever see. The premise is that a girl has been missing for the past 40 years and in order to know the reasons of her suspicious disappearing, her father deploys a journalist to solve this mystery. Daniel Craig is solid as the protagonist but it is Rooney Mara who steals the show with an electrifying performance which is quite unlike anything she has done in the past. Apart from having a commanding screen presence, her accent is spot on and she definitely deserved the accolades that she received. Visually, the film is a delight and the editing is crisp as well. Overall, the movie went by in a breeze despite its relatively long runtime.",10,1,4,27 May 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," A Unique Franchise that Keeps Getting Better!!
","It is rare to see a franchise in which the fourth and fifth movies are far better that the three preceding it. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation continues the change in fortunes that its predecessor brought upon. The audience is treated to big action set-pieces that consist of some of the most daring stunts performed by its star Tom Cruise. As seen in the trailer, Tom Cruise hangs from an aeroplane while it is in flight. This scene was actually performed without any special effects. A recent trend in action movies has been the use of practical effects over the unrealistic CGI. Here, the director has chosen stunts that do not rely on special effects. Apart from Tom Cruise, the movie has Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. The enviable cast does a great job and no actor seems out of place while playing their roles.The Impossible Missions Force faces a setback early in the movie as the court dismisses it due to the great amount of destruction that has been caused by them. Due to the unwillingness of the CIA to acknowledge the presence of the Syndicate, the primary objective that the team has is to prove their existence and get vindicated.Rogue Nation is a summer blockbuster that delivers on its lofty expectations. Even though I would rate Ghost Protocol slightly above this movie, I am still immensely excited by the possibility of future sequels of this franchise that refuses to die.",9,0,3,19 August 2015
District 9," An Intelligent depiction of the future
","District 9 is the debut movie of Neill Blomkamp featuring largely unknown actors depicting a future in which aliens are residing in Earth along with humans. The movie is presented in a mockumentary-style format with the actors speaking directly to the camera. The plot shows how a normal human is starting to turn into an alien due to being exposed to a mysterious liquid. The emotions captured by the actor are quite realistic and shows how any ordinary person would respond on knowing that he can no longer be a human. The story is quite intriguing which makes this a pleasant watch. However, I am surprised by how overwhelmingly positive reviews this movie has garnered as it has plenty of flaws as well. If you want to watch a slightly different science fiction movie, then give this a try.",8,0,0,16 June 2015
Before Sunset," Before Sunrise: Part 2
","Before Sunset is the sequel to the romantic movie Before Sunrise. Like its predecessor, it takes place strictly in real time. Again, there is no action or any other elements that are supposed to be present in a typical movie. The movie just focuses on the meeting of the two lead characters after a gap of 9 years since they met on the train. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy return and in addition to acting they also helped with the screenplay and are credited for the effort. The acting is effortless and the fact that the characters as well as the actors have aged exactly the same way adds to the realism that this movie aims for. Richard Linklater does not disappoint with the sequel that manages to stand as a great film on its own without comparing it to Before Sunrise. My only grievance for this movie is that it tends to get overdramatic in certain moments like when Julie Delpy breaks down while explaining that she always fails at relationships. The ambiguous ending keeps us wanting more which is just brilliant.",9,0,0,25 June 2015
The Pianist," An Undeniable Masterpiece!!
","The Pianist shares its themes with another movie depicting the holocaust, that is, Schindler's List. If a movie is compared to one of the greatest movies of all time then it must be quite spectacular. The Pianist does not cut any corners in depicting the brutality of the Nazis and the pathetic living conditions of the Jews who were subjected to a very low standard of living. The performances are completely natural and no one goes overboard in portraying a particular role. Adrien Brody gives a subdued performance as a man whose only purpose is to survive against massive odds. His hope of playing the piano for the radio station is the sole motivation that keeps him alive. The director shows incredible attention to detail in capturing the brutal assaults by the Gestapo officers and the bombing of the Jews. The protagonist in this movie is not a hero but a survivor. This movie is a must watch and is almost as good as Schindler's List.",10,0,0,11 June 2015
Drive," A Modern Taxi Driver
","Drive is an art-house film that not only manages to keep the viewer engrossed throughout the movie but also manages to captivate audiences by the unexpected violence and the ambiguous ending.It features Ryan Gosling in the lead role as a part-time movie stunt driver. The character portrayed is strange and psychologically troubled. He is magnificently portrayed by Gosling which certainly deserves recognition. Overall, the casting is brilliant with each actor perfectly suited to their respective roles. Albert Brooks is a wiseguy and he gives an Oscar-worthy performance in a relatively small role.Unlike most mainstream movies, Drive has major portions of the movie without any dialog. The eclectic, groovy soundtrack perfectly fills the silences and manages to set the mood. Drive is a unique movie and the only comparable movie that I found was Taxi Driver which is considered as one of the greatest movies of all time. Due to the ambiguous ending, this certainly has a great repeat value and I only expect it to be better on a second viewing.",10,2,3,12 July 2015
Frozen," A Disney Fantasy for Kids
","Frozen is a fantasy musical movie that features Elsa who has supernatural powers through which she can freeze anything that she desires. She does not have complete control over her overwhelming powers but manages to keep it in check by wearing gloves. Elsa is about to be coronated but upon the discovery of her hidden powers, she is labeled as a freak which forces her to leave the castle and escape towards the mountain.Her sister Anna who believes in true love sets out to bring her maligned sister Elsa back. The plot is clichéd and is quite predictable at times. Even though the animation is breathtaking, the story leaves a lot to be desired as a little more inventiveness is expected from Disney.The primary problem with this movie is that it is too childish and it can be painstaking to watch for most adults. If you compare this movie to any respectable Pixar movie, it pales in comparison as the latter always makes films that are enjoyable for all age groups. The magical tale is filled with predictable occurrences which take away the excitement and it makes the climax much less tense. Frozen will likely be popular with kids but will be hard to sell to others due to the overly optimistic tone. The songs are good as well with 'Let It Go' being the best of the lot. A good movie that does not offer anything new in this genre.",7,1,5,9 July 2015
The Hurt Locker," Overrated Movie
","Of late, I have not really liked the movies that have gone on to win Academy Awards for Best Picture. The Hurt Locker was bestowed with this honor in 2009. Thus, the expectations that I had with this movie were unreasonably high. However, after viewing the movie I am unsatisfied with the movie. The main problem with the movie is that there is no clear story. The movie is based on the US invasion in Iraq. The main character is played by Jeremy Renner who is fantastic as the fearless guy who always puts his life on the line while disarming bombs. We are never really told about what the objective of the movie is supposed to be. The acting feels real and it is one of the strong points in this movie. A number of war veterans have pointed out several inaccuracies in the portrayal. As a viewer, there has to be some sort of a resolution during the end but no such thing was to be found here. It definitely felt like a waste of time and if you are looking for a hard-hitting war movie, go and watch Saving Private Ryan for a much more memorable experience.",6,2,3,6 June 2015
Ex Machina," A Sci-Fi Movie that mixes realism with complex ideas!!
","Ex Machina features a premise that is somewhat related to the Spike Jonze movie Her. In this movie, a young talented coder is invited to a private island of a scientist whose quest is to use artificial intelligence to make a robot that can behave like a human. As Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) believes that he has been chosen due to his technical skills, he soon finds out that he is singled out due to a completely different reason. His day-to-day activities involve interacting with Ava, a female robot that has emotions like any other human. After a while, Caleb starts to fall in love with her that complicates things.Even though most of the movie seems fairly straight-forward, the director pulls the rug from under the audience by presenting an ending that seems bizarre and confusing. In one viewing, it is almost impossible to uncover the complete meaning behind that last scene.Ex Machina seems like any other science fiction movie but it manages to be original with a challenging plot that will keep the viewers engaged.",8,1,3,24 August 2015
Donnie Brasco," Johnny Depp Steals The Show!!
","When you have two seasoned actors who have given legendary performances over the course of their careers, you are guaranteed to have a stellar movie. In Donnie Brasco, we have Johnny Depp and Al Pacino in the leading roles that is based on the real-life Johnny Pistone, an undercover FBI agent who infiltrates the mafia in order to gain evidence that lead to their arrests. It is a typical mafia movie that is inspired by Goodfellas. We get to see the human side of these horrible people. Johnny Depp is unbelievably good as he is laconic yet assertive and someone who always has the sense of control. A truly mesmerizing performance that must be one of the best seen in modern cinema. Al Pacino plays a real life gangster Lefty. Pacino plays his role with his usual flair and propensity to scream.The story is quite fulfilling and shows the effects that a person leading a double life has. It does not intend to show Johnny Pistone as a hero but as a regular person who is devoted to his job.Donnie Brasco is a must-watch due to its chillingly realistic depiction of the ruthless mafia.",9,0,0,29 July 2015
Friends with Benefits," A Standard Rom-Com with Charming Leads
","Friends with Benefits does not redefine the tried and tested rom-com formula. It is pretty much the same as any of the other movies from this genre. However, the lead actors Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have a mesmerizing chemistry which makes the movie really watchable. The writing is crisp and witty. The story is about two people who decide to have sex without getting in a relationship. However, they eventually develop feelings for each other without admitting it. The film separates itself from the bunch by being self-conscious as the leads repeatedly mention the fact that their story is similar to a Hollywood movie. However, some of the melodrama seems contrived when everything seemed to be going perfectly well between the two. Mila Kunis shines in this movie and is extremely likable. Watch it for the chemistry and sharp dialog.",8,0,2,10 June 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A Magical Experience
","Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix was the longest novel in the entire series but the film adaptation is one of the shortest of all the Harry Potter movies. Harry, Ron and Hermione return once again along with some new characters such as Luna Lovegood, Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange. Each one of these characters is well played with the role of Umbridge being especially good. The direction is fairly decent with the magical world being replicated through extravagant sets. The filmmakers are able to extract the essence of the novel and present it without going for every little detail. This results in a taut, tight movie which is just over 2 hours long. However, the only sin that the movie has is that it feels like an abbreviated version of the novel as a result of which the movie feels extremely rushed and therefore it is not as enjoyable as reading the novel.",8,0,2,28 June 2015
Saw," A One-Time Watch
","Saw is highly regarded as one of the most influential horror movies of the 21st century. If the role of the movie is to disturb the viewer and make them question their own actions, then it succeeds in its goal. However, any movie even if it is a Horror flick, must have characters which you can root for, who are able to enable the viewer to feel the emotions that the characters are feeling. Due to budget constraints, the filmmakers decide to lock the two leading characters inside a room which ensures a claustrophobic atmosphere that complements the paranoia engulfing these men. Due to its short run time, the characters feel underdeveloped and because of that we can never truly feel any sorrow for them. A common problem to all the movies to the horror genre is that most of the plot is filled with clichés which have already been done in other movies. Saw is no exception and it can get a bit irritating to see things that you have seen in countless other horror movies. The movie is not very simple to understand and will confuse some viewers. I did not particularly enjoy watching this movie but everyone should watch it and form their own judgement.",6,1,2,5 June 2015
Limitless," Good but not Great
","The premise of Limitless is highly intriguing and the casting of Bradley Cooper in the lead role makes us hard to look away from the screen. The charismatic Cooper carries the movie on his shoulders as he inhabits his character perfectly and makes the movie a treat to watch. On receiving a mysterious drug which supposedly allows an individual to access 100 percent of his brain, Bradley Cooper's character is able to complete a novel in 4 days by taking this wonder pill. As his ambitiousness grows, he decides to use his deductive skills to make some quick money in the stock market. Even though the effects of the drug made a remarkable turnaround in his life, its side-effects were starting to show up which happened on withdrawal of the drug. The flaw in this movie is that a lot of action seems to happen at a convenient time and it seems a little unrealistic. Also, at the end we do not know the whereabouts of the people in his home. The movie was a decent one but do not have exceedingly high expectations.",8,0,0,4 June 2015
Psycho," An Untouchable Masterpiece!!!
","When you are watching a great movie, it can be ascertained within the first few seconds itself. Psycho, is no exception to that rule, as it has influenced several genres of film and has been widely imitated yet no other movie has managed to replicate the staggering impact that it had.A secretary steals $40000 and decides to run away. While escaping in her car, she has to stop for the night and retires to a secluded motel that is far away from the highway. Here, she encounters Norman Bates, the owner of the motel, who seems like a perfectly normal, charming person who has a cheerful demeanor.The acting is phenomenal and the natural performances by everyone involved in this movie make it seem effortless. Alfred Hitchcock, who is regarded as one of the most influential directors ever, has shot this movie brilliantly and every shot, every scene seems like a crucial piece in the puzzle that this movie is. Psycho would not have been nearly as effective if not for the haunting score composed by Bernard Hermann. The music that is played during the shower scene is one of the most recognizable and compelling pieces ever written. As the tone of the movie is rather mysterious, the score serves as an audio guide due to the ominous sounds that are played.Psycho is a compelling, ingenious, and singular movie that has managed to push the boundaries of filmmaking and is one of the best movies that has ever been made. No amount of praise will be able to take away the magic of this movie which can only be experienced by viewing it.",10,1,2,27 July 2015
Jaws," A Masterful Thriller with a Killer Soundtrack
","So, this is the movie which put the summer blockbuster on the map. This is the movie which made the line 'We are gonna need a bigger boat' one of the most iconic lines in all of cinema. The soundtrack of this movie is one of the most influential and has been imitated by numerous other musicians. Jaws revolves around the life of a police chief whose duty is to ensure the safety of the people swimming in the water. Due to a killer shark who manages to kill two people, chief Brody tries to close the beach but is not allowed to do so as the people in that area are dependent on the tourists in order to run their business. However, due to the death of another person, the beach is closed until the killer shark is captured. A fisherman volunteers to do so in exchange of a hefty reward. After that the chief, fisherman and the marine biologist who was called in for his expertise on sharks. Now, on the boat we witness some of the most thrilling scenes seen at the time it was released. The soundtrack heightened the suspense which made it all the more riveting to watch. The film features a number of unusual camera angles which is a testament to the perfectionism of Steven Spielberg. The movie is well-known to have gone well over budget and also exceeding its production time by 100 days. The final product though makes it worth the wait and Jaws propelled Spielberg into stardom. Jaws must be watched by one and all but be prepared for one hell of a ride.",9,2,4,4 June 2015
Monsters University," A Decent effort but not up to the level that Pixar has done before!!
","Monsters University is the prequel to the 2001 movie Monsters, Inc. This is the first instance of a prequel being made in Pixar history. Even though the quality of movies has dropped in recent years, Monsters University has done enough to satisfy its core audience of kids.The animation as well as the voice acting is done superbly. All the surroundings are well detailed and are comparable to the work done by Miyazaki.Most of the animated movies follow a formula and this movie is no exception. It describes how Mike and Sullivan team up to be scare partners. Mike has always been an odd monster who has been constantly disparaged by his peers as well as his teachers. On the other hand, Sullivan comes from a reputed family and is widely admired by everyone even if his technique is one-dimensional.Over the course of the story, both of them manage to get expelled. To make up for this disappointment, Mike decides to form a team which includes amongst others Sullivan as well. Despite being the most mediocre team, they manage to overcome the odds and prove the others wrong.Monsters University is a feel-good movie that must be seen at face value. The story is not an entirely original one but the movie is good enough for a one-time watch.",7,0,0,4 August 2015
Before Sunrise," A Minimalistic Masterpiece
",I am amazed by this movie. That is surprising considering the fact that there is not much that occurs in this movie apart from talking. Before Sunrise is a romantic movie in which two people meet in a train and decide to spend a day together despite the fact that they just met and are unlikely to see each other ever again. The performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is real and not exaggerated like we see in a lot of movies. The entire film seems like it is taken from our lives and we can totally relate to the characters and the circumstances that they are in. The movie is filled with wonderful ideas about life and the meaning of it. Richard Linklater must be praised for making a movie like this and I would love to see movies that are similar. A good screenplay is the cornerstone of any great movie and Before Sunrise is no exception. An interesting aspect of this movie is that the entire film takes place in a 24-hour time span. This movie must be seen if you like sensible movies and a realistic story.,10,2,2,25 May 2015
X2: X-Men United," A Benchmark for all superhero movies!!
","The original X-Men movie was one of the best comic book movies that I had ever seen. With X2, we have director Bryan Singer returning for a sequel which manages the rare feat of surpassing the original in terms of quality. Once again, we have an ensemble cast comprising of the X-Men, i.e., the mutants.Despite the large number of main characters, each of them have their own unique identity which has been shown in this film. There are some stellar action sequences along with some superb set design. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are the two outstanding cast members who have fleshed out commanding characters played with a steely calmness.Due to the impressive ending, it enables the movie to serve as the perfect set up for all the future sequels. Every aspect of the movie manages to exceed the lofty expectations. X2 is one of the best sequels ever and is recommended for all.",10,0,0,1 August 2015
Casino," A Scorsese Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese has a penchant for making great movies and he literally owns the gangster genre. Casino shows the life of the mobsters who run the casino and the elaborate measures that they take in order to avoid being arrested. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci star in this movie and both of them leave a mark by playing nuanced characters with great finesse. However, Sharon Stone, who plays Ginger, the wife of De Niro's character, is the one who steals the show with a crazy, tumultuous performance of a greedy woman who has gotten mixed up in drugs, alcohol, etc. and has lost control over herself. She has irresistible charm but her egoistic tendencies manage to get the better of her.The direction by Scorsese is highly energetic with constant camera movements, beautiful cinematography and a voice over that suits the movie. The first half, in particular, is highly entertaining as the audience is shown how a casino works. The movie is a tad bit too long clocking at almost 3 hours. As a result, it loses a bit of steam towards the end. If you cannot stomach violence, then this is not the movie for you. But, if you liked Goodfellas, you are going to love Casino.",10,1,2,4 July 2015
Heat," A Near Perfect Movie!!
","I am a big fan of crime thrillers. It does not take a lot of time for you to realize that you are watching a great movie. The dialogs, acting, cinematography and direction are top-notch which elevate the movie to a great level. The film features Robert De Niro who is a professional criminal and Al Pacino who is an LAPD detective tasked with catching De Niro. A film featuring two past Oscar winners in itself is a good enough reason to watch this movie. Both of them give stellar performances and the rest of the cast give a decent support to these two powerhouses. The screenplay is smart without being self indulgent. A truly spectacular movie that demands repeat viewing.",9,1,3,17 June 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," A Realistic View of The Life of a Musician!!
","Inside Llewyn Davis is a drama that is set in the 60s. It features Oscar Isaac in the leading role as a struggling folk singer. This movie by the Coen Brothers is markedly different from some of their previous ventures as it is much more serious with little humor. Despite having a relatively short runtime of just over 100 minutes, the film manages to show the journey of a musician who has to face rejection most of the time, sleep on other people's couch, and in general find it hard to make ends meet. Oscar Isaac is brilliant in the role and he shows great emotion while playing the guitar. Carey Mulligan plays the friend of Llewyn Davis who is furious at him for getting her pregnant. She does a decent job in her small role.The Coen Brothers don't give us a typical Hollywood movie in which everything works out in the end. Instead, we get to see how the hopes and dreams of Llewyn Davis are crushed and he has no choice but to quit playing music. The film is anticlimactic but the journey is worth the watch.",9,0,0,13 July 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Horror, really?
","Even though the movie has a high number of on screen deaths, I was not scared at any point of time. As this movie is supposed to be a slasher film, my expectations were much higher. In this film, there are five people who decide to go to a cabin in the woods. The title is very apt. Now, here things start to get interesting as they find out some undead people, a mysterious room and other haunted images. Apart from this, there are a number of people who are overlooking the protagonists from an unknown place. One of the problems in this movie is that we never get to know the motivation behind the happenings that are taking place. This makes the overall experience much less enjoyable. The starting of the movie was promising but the rest of the movie was a huge letdown. I believe 6 stars is what this movie deserves and I think I am being generous.",6,1,1,25 May 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," A Grand Movie with an Unrealistic Story
","Slumdog Millionaire focuses on a slumdog Jamal played by Dev Patel who happens to win the grand prize in the show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. The movie is set in Mumbai and the director seems to have done quite some research which is evident by the final product. It manages to give us a glimpse of the harsh, brutal life that these people have to live. Despite the beautiful cinematography and visionary direction, there are quite a number of points in this movie that are completely unrealistic. First of all, poor people with limited education cannot speak perfect English, in fact, it is highly unlikely for them to even know a few English words. I guess most of the dialogs were in English to make the story accessible to a wider audience. The acting by everyone is quite credible including a number of untrained street kids who were highly believable in their roles.The Academy Award winning score by A.R. Rahman adds another dimension to this film and it manages to complement the tone of the movie perfectly.The movie was made for a global audience and the prime objective was to show the blatant exploitation of poor children by egregious, unconscentious people who force them to beg and do other abhorrent errands. It managed to win the Academy Award for Best Picture but it is unlikely to be loved by Indians due to how they show us in a poor light. All in all, this is a well directed romance that is in some ways like a typical Bollywood masala film. I would give it 7 stars due to my conflicting views on this movie.",7,0,3,8 July 2015
Jurassic Park," A Classic that has stood the test of time!!
","Jurassic Park is an adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Michael Crichton. Even though the movie cuts various parts of the novel, it manages to capture the essence upon which the story is built.This movie combines elements of science fiction, horror, and suspense which makes this film a singular achievement in the realm of cinema. Despite the ubiquity of CGI in today's big budget blockbusters, no other movie has utilized visual effects more effectively to tell a story than Jurassic Park. The casting is so good that there is no element that can be criticized. Both the child actors do a wonderful job as they have as much screen time as their vastly experienced compatriots. John Williams, Steven Spielberg's frequent collaborator, has once again given an iconic score that has one of the most memorable tunes ever written.There is hardly any aspect of Jurassic Park that I did not enjoy. In the beginning, there is a genuine sense of wonder at the unbelievable feat of recreating dinosaurs. At the end, we dread the sight of these creatures due to several horrific incidents during the course of this movie. It combines all these elements due to which it can be enjoyed by children and adults as well. It is a memorable movie and I cannot give you any more reasons to go out there and watch it right now.",10,4,5,23 July 2015
Atonement," A Fascinating Romance backed by solid performances
","Atonement is awesome. It is a romance movie but the film dwells on a lot of other subjects such as regret, forgiveness, and hatred. James McAvoy plays Robbie who is falsely implicated by 13 year old Briony played by Saoirse Ronan who gives an Oscar-worthy performance. The casting is wonderfully done and the editing seamlessly fuses three separate generations together. Ultimately, Briony realizes her fault and is unable to make amends as Robbie and Cecilia are unwilling to forgive her. The visuals are realistic and the attention to detail is palpable. There is a brilliant scene in which Briony comes to Robbie and Cecilia's home to apologize for her mistake and James McAvoy gives a verbal thrashing letting out all the anger built up over the years. It is a stunning performance and is incredibly acted by everyone involved in this scene. As the movie is just a little over two hours, the movie flies by without leaving the feeling that any scene is dragging on needlessly. Atonement is definitely one of the best movies of 2007 and deserves to be seen by a wide audience.",9,0,1,19 June 2015
