The Blair Witch Project," Over-hyped
","Look, I know that as a college student and film fan I'm supposed to prattle on that this was the coolest, scariest film ever.  Well, it's not.  The idea behind it is great, the execution is decent, but when it all comes to an end I had to agree with the rest of the audience I saw it with: 'You mean, that's it??' The ending didn't leave you hanging, it just left you.  This was the first film I ever saw where the whole audience responded at the end with a collective 'You've gotta be kidding me, what the heck was that?' Plenty of people have said it scared them away from camping, all it did for me was make me a little nauseated (The Blair Sick Project strikes again) and wish I still had the money I paid to see it.  Maybe I won't go camping in places I've heard witch stories about now, but I doubt I would have before. You'll most likely go see it anyway, but I honestly don't know why.",3,0,2,14 August 1999
Hero," B-O-R-I-N-G
","This is the first (and hopefully only) time I have EVER fallen asleep in a theater.  Not only that, but the only thing that woke me up (dead serious, folks) was the person behind me SNORING.Overdone cinematography and a general sense of self-righteousness engulfs this dog of a flick.  Don't see it on a dare.  The plot was predictable, the acting was bad (even while dubbed), and the effects ellicited more laughs than anything else.2 out of 10, and that's only because my wife is convinced it might have a deeper meaning.  Quite possibly the single worst film ever put to film (and this includes Dude, Where's My Car?)",2,0,5,29 August 2004
Con Air," what an awful ending
","Let's be brutally honest, no matter how much you love action films you have to admit that the end of this movie was incredibly contrived.  The film could and should have ended about an hour before it actually did so, no single session of commenting could sum up all of the unnecessary footage/over acting/explosions(most of which occurred without any real cause)/etc.  While enjoyable as a popcorn flick, the film isn't worth multiple viewings.",5,2,3,18 April 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," I'd rate it higher, but 10's the top.
","Wow!  This is a great film, one which surpasses anything I or anyone else could ever say about it.  Truly one of the best films ever.",10,1,2,18 April 1999
