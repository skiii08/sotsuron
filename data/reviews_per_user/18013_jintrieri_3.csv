Casablanca," Unbelievable
","Casablanca is an unbelievable movie that contains one of the greatest love story's ever. Casablanca is a passionate movie and its two leads Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make this happen in a spiritual way. Their chemistry is the greatest seen on screen. The movie is touching and the scene that touches me the most is when Sam plays 'As Time Goes By.' The North African Location is exotic and adds to the feeling of romance. Humphrey Bogart as Rick is great and you can see his longing for Ingrid Bergman. The flashback scenes in Paris are the greatest expressions of romance ever filmed and you can see the love they shared and how it comes full circle in Casablanca. A lot of famous line are from this movie such as 'Sing It Sam', 'Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?' and the most famous line 'Here's looking at you kid'. Casablanca is a beautiful story of love that will be shared forever.",10,1,3,19 January 2008
Casino," My Favorite Movie
","Casino is my favorite movie of all time. It captures the glamor of Las Vegas and its films like these that I yearn to go. The film is about how the mob controlled Las Vegas and how at the end it brought them down at the end. This movie is in a way like Goodfellas in that is was directed by Martin Scorsese, based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi who also wrote the screenplay, has Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent and is about rise and fall in the mob. I think its better than Goodfellas even though Goodfellas is also amazing and would be my 2nd favorite film. Casino is so great. It has a colorful feel to it and shows the wealth in it. The performances are unbelievable. Robert De Niro is great as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein the head of the casino. Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing as Nicky Santoro the psychopath who is sent to protect Sam. Sharon Stone is in a career best performance as Rothsteins wife. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and Scorsese's best. Casino is my favorite movie and Scorese's best.",10,1,2,19 January 2008
Goodfellas," One the greatest movies ever
","Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he's ever produced. Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever and one of Scorsese's all time best.",10,6,10,19 January 2008
