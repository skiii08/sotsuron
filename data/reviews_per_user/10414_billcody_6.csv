Requiem for a Dream," Made by someone who was never in the game
","This is a movie made by someone who was never in the game, and written by someone who has been out of it for years. There is nothing remotely truthful about this movie. The people who think that it is - don't know the first thing about drug addiction. It does have one thing in common with a drug addict, though. It is repetitive and boring. I was really looking forward to this film. I loved PI. I just hope Aronofsky isn't a one shot wonder.",1,27,54,12 February 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Overrated, but quite good.
","There was much to like about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon from the middle desert scenes to the wonderful interactions between strong female characters from different generations.Many afficionados of the Hong Kong fantasy genre will be somewhat disappointed, however. Some of the set pieces are exact duplicates from older films, and Yun Fat Chow is probably the most bland of all Hong Kong action stars and seems completely adrift in this role.",7,0,0,13 March 2002
The Godfather: Part III," Like watching paint dry.
","Whoa. It took me years to watch this film because so many people told me to avoid it. I should have taken their advice.Pacino should have been forced to watch the original Godfather films 100 times each to remind him what he was like when he was a real actor. The original Michael Corleone was scary because he was so controlled and introverted. His rage boiled inside. In Part III, Michael is a mugging scenary chewer who wears his emotions on his sleeves and screams at the drop of a hat.And the Francis Ford Coppola directing Part III isn't the visionary of the 70's, but instead the bored hack of the 80's and 90's. The script is a lazy B-movie script with large chunks of unnecessary expository dialogue. The actors seem to be left to their own devices, especially Sofia who seems to be either reading off cue cards or merely reciting her lines. She's so bad. I honestly think her performance her might be the worst acting I've ever seen, and I'm including school plays and community theater I've seen over the years. Diane Keaton looks like she just dropped in from her real daughter's PTA meeting (which isn't so terrible considering the role she has in the film) and Talia Shire shows the rust of a woman who really hasn't acted much outside her thankless turns in the later Rocky flicks.This film could have used a fresh idea or two, another couple of passes at the screenplay and whole lot less of the Coppola family. (Hell, even Nicholas Coppola er Cage got a friggen Exec Producer credit - what's up with that?)",3,7,13,2 September 2002
X2: X-Men United," Boring!
","Watched this film with a friend who lives for comic books and superhero movies. When the lights came up he turned and asked me how it grabbed me - 'It didn't' - I replied to which he said - 'Me, neither.'Seriously. Is it too much to ask for a story that makes sense, characters that we care about and action scenes that are choreographed and lit well? Halfway through I wanted to get up and leave. The only enjoyment all night was the Matrix trailer that was at least 10 times more exciting than anything in this snooze-a-thon.",3,3,5,3 May 2003
Rock Star," what a waste
","From reading some of the other posts it is pretty obvious how badly this film failed on almost every level.Most people think the movie takes place in the eighties - I guess that is because of the numerous hair band cliches and some of the music. But if that was true - how could Mark Walhberg's character end up in post grunge Seattle after one short tour? The true story that this cliche ridden film was based on was - as one poster already pointed out - was legendary metal band Judas Priest replacing their long time lead singer with a singer from a Judas Priest tribute band. What was really interesting about the story to most people was that at the time Judas Priest was often playing to smaller crowds than Rippers Owens' tribute band did back in Pittsburg - and how Owens and crew eventually won over long time fans. But why bother telling a little told story of a band overcoming the reluctance of their old fans when you can fall back on the old as dirt - Star Is Born based rise to stardom - and inevitable fall - brought down by sex drugs and rock and roll - nonsense that permeates this film. I mean that would take a little work and skill wouldn't it.But back to the main question - just when is this flick supposed to take place? The 70's, the 80's the 90's? They have a Ted Nugent song being played in a disco right next to Relax by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Seriously! The filmakers seem so out of touch with any time period it is hard to imagine they have even been to a rock concert in the last twenty years. The look of the film seems to be based almost completely on repeated viewings of Behind The Music. But, hey that seems to be John Stockwell's specialty. Taking a subculture and writing such an unbelievable piece of tripe that any chance of making a good film about that scene will be instantly destroyed when his unsuccessful film bombs at the box office. (See last summer's Blue Crush.) Which begs the question - who's blank is he blanking anyway?Having said that - Mark Wahlberg is actually quite good and it's a shame his performance was wasted in this drek. He sings the songs and actually has a great set of pipes.",Null,1,2,2 February 2003
The Godfather," Very good, but not #1.
","Like Citizen Kane, the Godfather is extremely influential, but more than a bit overrated. Coppola has essentially one trick - intercuttung violence with religious ceremonies. In the first two Godfather films this is an extremely effective device. Unfortunately, some of the other parts of this film are not quite as well thought out. The scenes of Michael in Italy are too long and underdeveloped. Appolonia falls for Michael in a way that only happens in the movies so the audience has very little emotional investment in her or her death. Most people would say I'm nitpicking, but to be honest there are more than a few films that I have enjoyed more than the Godfather.
Having said that, this cast (Fred Roos is the greatest casting director ever) and crew might be the best group of talent ever assembled for one film.  They went on to make some of the greatest films of their generation both in front of, and behind the camera. If you don't believe me, just check their individual credits.",9,1,3,2 September 2002
