Iron Man 3," Why did you ruin the mandarin
","this was a good edition to the iron man series but very disappointing, the best thing about the movie was its humor and action, with another excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. and well Guy Pearce is brilliant in anything he does. heres the point I want to make, as a major iron man fan I think what they did with the character of the mandarin was literally a jail-able Offence (SPOILER ALERT)...Marvel built up the character of the mandarin so much with the media and the trailers and of course it was just a ploy so we would be shocked that the mandarin was just a phony a distraction to the real mandarin Aldrich Killian( who in the comics shoots himself in the head and is just a crazy scientist), when I went into the movie I was expecting a ground breaking villain like the joker and bane in the DK trilogy..but no Ironman 3 did not stay true to the comic books and ruined Ironmans greatest foe, WHY?? mandarin is to Tony Stark what joker is to Bruce Wayne, what the green goblin is to Peter Parker, you ruined a great villain, and that ruined the movie for me as a life long iron man fan..",6,1,6,25 April 2013
