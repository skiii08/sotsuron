The Avengers," AWESOME FROM BEGINNING TO END!
",No spoilers here - all the characters were introduced so seamlessly. You're like HEY its Spiderman or HeY its that dude with wings from the end of the last ex men. etc etc There were few things better done and more entertaining than introducing the guardians of the galaxy crew in. That had some hilarious results. I love the Dr Strange/Tony Stark moments but you kinda knew they had to come. Bruce fighting with Hulk was hilarious. Thanos is a great character and a way that unifies what all the teams are doing. One of the highlights of the film has to be when peter dinklage shows up in ....well in the form he showed up in! (you'll see!) it was delightful to see him and i heard at least 10 audible sighs of glee at seeing him. Groot and Rocket hangin around with Thor was Hilarious. Saw a few people I didn't know but Black Panther and a few others ended up being cool too. Great job stan lee and jon favreau - can't wait to see the next one. so many deaths in this one that i feel like we need a support group just to get us to the next one!,10,2,3,7 May 2018
Shakespeare in Love," Revolutionary
","You remember what Shrek did for animated film? That's what this does for modern period pieces. You go in not knowing what to expect. Expecting some boring rendition of Shakespeare's life. It's so far from that. And boy will you fall in love with Joseph Fiennes. If you didn't know the 'other' Fiennes - you will now. Without spoiling it - you will see a story within a story centered around one of the most famous Shakespearean works. It is genius. Also the first time I saw Gwyneth playing a brit and she does it amazingly well. And not to be forgotten - the music is enchanting and does what a soundtrack should do - transports you, engages you deeper into the story. Costumes - superb. Geoffrey Rush - superb. Even Ben Affleck playing this type of role - he's awesome. Actually, a stand-out in the film and doesn't have the biggest role. Just so well done. See it. I don't even have anything bad to say about it so I had to give it a 10. Oh and don't forget Julie Dench. Brilliant as usual, even more brilliant than usual.",10,3,3,29 November 2017

Pride & Prejudice," Absolutely Terrible.
","Almost not watchable. I AM a fan of Keira Knightley however, she is a silly and shallow Elizabeth Bennett! I don't know why as I've seen her be quite good in other period roles but she is TERRIBLE as Elizabeth Bennett. Makes her a very UNlikealbe character - you don't even root for her to win at the end. And Mr. Darcy in this...OMG. He literally possesses TWO emotions. Vapid and slightly less Vapid absolutely horrible. Does not inspire thoughts of romance and love! Do yourself a favor and catch the 1995 version with Colin Firth. THAT is the way it should have been done. If you can't find the 1995 version - then catch Becoming Jane - that's very good too. This version of P&P is truly not watchable - both the acting and the interpretation of the story/script are just terrible.",1,3,6,20 June 2017
The Greatest Showman," exactly what you expect
","AMAZING SONGS. Great dancing. Feel good. Feel great. Keala Settle steals the movie but everyone is GREAT. The minute it's over you want it to start over again and again and again. I didn't even read the critic reviews. I didn't care. Hugh is awesome. Zendaya, who I didn't even know from Adam, could teach Rianna and Rita Ora a thing or two about transitioning from singer to actress. She was really enchanting. What a great feel good movie. I want to see it again right now and I literally just saw it. The story is whatever, it's the story, but the MESSAGE and the MUSIC is everything. Easily just became one of my favorite movies. Thank you Hugh Jackman, Michael Gracey, Keala Settle,Benj Pasek,and Justin Paul. I cried a lot of happy musical tears.",10,0,3,31 December 2017
