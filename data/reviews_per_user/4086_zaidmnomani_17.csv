Iron Man 3," An Underrated Sequel
","Iron Man 3 is one of those MCU films that many simply forget about. And it's easy to see why. In the grand scheme of things, this film does not add much to the universe. But that is precisely why this movie is so enjoyable. Not every single movie in the MCU has to be part of a bigger story. Some films should stand on their own, and this film does that exceptionally well.Of course, this film does have its problems. This film came out during the time that Marvel had a major villain problem, and Adriach Killian is not a particularly fascinating character. Then there is the Mandarin, whom I think the movie handled rather cleverly. There are plot holes, which do make the experience less enjoyable.The action scenes especially are really different and intense. Instead of most of the action being about two big robots shooting each other, it instead focuses on Tony Stark trying to get himself out of sticky situations without only his ingenuity. The action in this film is relatively sprinkled out, with just enough of it until the final battle, which is both visually impressive and exciting.RDJ's performance as usual is pretty great, as is the humor. The script constantly pokes holes at some of the cliches that modern action films usually have, which are pretty funny. The film starts to really get good at the end of the first act, when Tony is forced to go on the run, but it's pretty consistent from there on.If you're looking for a film that's deeply inter-connected in the MCU and is necessary for the overall universe, then this film is probably not for you. But if you simply want a stand-alone movie that focuses more on Tony Stark and his troubles that is pretty simple and small scale, then this is the film for you.",7,0,1,23 April 2020
Kung Fu Panda," An Entertaining and Refreshing Movie
","Kung Fu Panda has always been one of my all time favorites. I was a little worried that the film would not hold up as well on multiple re-watches, but my conscience is reassured. This film is as good, if not better, than I remember it being.Po's character is both hilarious and relatable. Jack Black's voice acting is astounding, and he really brings the character to life. The other characters are all well written and serve the plot well. I particularly liked Shifu and his arc in this movie. Oogway filled the wise old mentor role, with great quotes and life lessons. The Furious Five are funny and good side characters, although they could have been fleshed out a bit more.But by far the best character in the film is Tailong. His motivations are understandable, he has an intimidating presence, and he makes for a formidable opponent. The part where he escapes from prison is one of the best villain establishing moments I've ever seen. Tailong then single-handily beats the Furious Five in an epic showdown.Another important aspect that the film had to get right was the Kung-Fu fights, and I'm glad to say that it was quite mind blowing how well choreographed it was. Each battle had a purpose, and every punch or kick had a meaning behind it. It was also really smooth looking.The message of the film isn't the most original, but it's executed beautifully, as both Shifu and Po understand the power of believing in something. The dragon's scroll is blank, and the way the characters react to it really highlights the difference between them. If you work hard and rightfully earn the scroll like Po, you see yourself in it and can understand that the true power comes from within. And if you chase after the scroll desperately, sacrificing everything for it, like Tailong, then you're forced to reflect at yourself and see what you've become.I also love the color palette of the movie. During Tailong's scenes the sky is usually dark and red, but whenever Po shows up it turns yellow. There's a nice little attention to detail, and plenty of call backs at the end that you'll notice if you pay attention closely. This is a movie that is especially rewarding upon re-watching. Kung Fu Panda is a story that will entertain kids and please adults, it will make you laugh and stare in awe, and as soon as it's over you will want see it again.",8,0,0,20 May 2020
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Hilariously Incompetent
","After the utter failure of X-Men: The Last Stand, Fox decided to change their plans for the franchise. Instead of having sequels, they would have origin stories based on individual characters. I believe that they originally planed to have an X-Men Origins: Magneto film as well. However, these plans were soon dropped, for reasons we'll soon get into.Let's start with the story. We have a rushed beginning that messily sets up the plot. The relationship of Wolverine and Sabertooth are given only a couple of scenes before they become enemies. There's a decent heist action sequence at first. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as Deadpool in the first scene he's in. But it quickly becomes bad after that.Wolverine decides to retire, get married, and live an idle life. Then his wife gets killed by his brother (Sabertooth). This feels rushed as well, because we're only given one scene with them together, and so it's hard to feel that emotional. The rest of the movie is Wolverine being hunted down and him trying to get revenge.I won't get into the entire plot since it's way to complicated. Wolverine jumps from one location to another, making the story feel all over the place and unfocused. Gambit appears in the film as well, only to leave after five minutes. The CGI is especially terrible. As anyone would have told you back then, it looked bad in 2009, and it's gone worse with time.When you stop to think about it, you realize this movie was kind of pointless. We already know Wolverine's backstory, and nothing else of importance is achieved. None of new characters in this film return later, and Wolverine himself forgets everything at the end. It feels like pointless filler. Really bad filler.The movie was so poorly received that the studio decided to scrap their plans for the 'X-Men: Origins' series, even though it made a decent amount of money at the box office. But it's quite a useless movie in the long run. If you're going to watch the entire X-Men franchise, it'll probably be best to leave this one out.",1,0,1,11 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," An Entertaining But Slightly Disappointing End to the Franchise
","ROTJ is the is the final movie in the original trilogy. Personally, I consider this one to be the weakest in the trilogy, but that does not mean it is a bad film. Bear in mind that the previous two movies in the trilogy are both considered to be the best in all of Star Wars. To top them would be quite a feat, and this movie does not quite manage do it.The subplot focusing on Luke and Vader is the most interesting aspect of the film. Vader return to the light and the inner conflict that he has both are executed beautifully. Luke's stubborn belief in his father and his struggle against the dark side are also done really well by Mark Hamill, who's performance in this film is the best in the OT. Also, Emperor Palpatine is just a perfect villain and is really fun to watch.However, the rest of the film is not so interesting. Jabba the Hutt's subplot takes up too much space and could have been cut down. The movie takes a complete halt once the gang get trapped by Ewoks. the Ewoks really drag the pacing down of this film. I think the movie would have been a lot more enjoyable if they had just made it a bit shorter.The third act is fun when it focuses on Luke and Vader. However, the other two subplots are not as interesting. The Ewoks defeating the stormtroopers through primitive weapons does not give the sense of an epic battle that a film like this should have. The rebellion fighters trying to destroy the death star feels very similar to the third act of A New Hope, except without the emotional resonance. When two thirds of your third act are quite dull, it somewhat lessens the impact of the film. That being said, I really do enjoy the celebration at the end of the film, with Vader's burning body and everyone embracing each other.",7,1,1,19 April 2020
Suicide Squad," The Very Definition of a Bad Movie
","Suicide Squad is a pretty terrible film. The premise is promising, and it's enjoyable in a so bad it's good way, but that's all the praise that I'm capable of giving this film. Every aspect of this film is an absolute failure.The movie features such a large cast that it's hard to develop any of the characters. Harley Quin and Deadshot (and maybe Diablo) are about the only ones that I could say have somewhat of a personality. The rest are merely side characters.Harley's character is that she's crazy and she cracks jokes. Deadshot's character is that he cares about his daughter and every decision he makes is because of her. Diablo is sad because his family died because of him and he refuses to use his powers now. I'd like to remind you that these are the best characters in the film, and yet they all feel one-dimensional and cliche.The plot is something that's been done a million times already. Bad guy escapes from confinement and then shoots a giant laser in the sky to blow up/Terra form the planet. Meanwhile a ragtag group of misfits work together to try and stop him/her with a low chance of them winning *Yawn*.The acting ranges from terrible to okay. Jared Leto stands out as the worst actor in the film, with a performance so bad it seemed like a parody of the Joker. Will Smith is trying to save the film, but his line delivery is off. Margot Robbie is okay. However, the main problem arises in the terrible dialogue, which feels like something that Micheal Bay wrote.The comedy feels forced and cringe worthy. I heard that they were re-shoots with the film to add more jokes and make the tone feel more lighthearted. Clearly DC were trying to copy Marvel movies and make them similar to them in tone. This also explains the futile attempt at having catchy songs shoved in to make it more like Guardians of the Galaxy. Unfortunately, this film lacks any heart that GOTG had.The premise itself is quite idiotic. Why do you need a bunch of villains to save the world when you have much stronger heroes who could do the job better? Most of the members of Suicide Squad barely have any powers that an ordinary military soldier won't have. The only exception is Diablo. Other than him, none of the characters should be the choice to fight a super powered villain.The plot is riddled with contrivances and pointless action. The color palate is dark, vomit like green. The CGI is (as usual with all DC movies) quite garbage looking. Watch this movie if you hate yourself.",3,1,2,11 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Boring and Predictable
","This movie is extremely dull to watch and one of the worst Star Wars movies ever made. But perhaps I should be fair. There are some decent moments in the film. The visuals are pretty solid. Kylo Ren was the best character. The movie was never boring. Um..., at least we got another 'Do It' from Palpatine? (I'm really grasping at straws here).This movie feels like JJ Abrams giving a middle finger to the Last Jedi. And while that film did have it's problems, instead of effectively undoing all the narrative decisions of the previous movie, they should have tried to at least have a movie that builds up on the story set by The Last Jedi.The movie spends most of it's runtime on some cliche McGuffin plot, jumping from one planet to another. The movie introduces so many new characters and locations, that there is hardly any time left for our main heroes.This movie does not feel like a film that someone wanted to make, or a vision that a filmmaker had. Rather, it feels like a desperate attempt to please as many fans as possible. In trying to please everyone, this movie has ended up pleasing no one.Out of all the films in the sequel trilogy this one is the least controversial among fans, and it's easy to see why. No plan, no vision, no passion. Just spectacle for spectacle's sake. Star Wars fans deserved better.",4,14,20,29 April 2020
Justice League," The Worst Possible Way to Spend Three Hundred Million Dollars.
","This movie is one of the worst big budget films I have ever seen. This film fails both as a Justice League story and as a film itself. Every single aspect of this film ranges from substandard to absolute garbage.Let's start with the most important aspect that all movies should be stellar at. The main characters. If the main characters are not interesting, then people will not like your film. Plain and simple. Apparently the writers behind Justice League clearly did not know nor care about this. Lets start with Batman.Batman in this film is completely useless. While everyone else in the film is some sort of super-powered alien or hero who can do all sorts of crazy things, Batman is just a human. His main part to play in the film is to bring the Justice League together, but after he does that he sort of hangs around in the background shooting a bunch of PS 2 aliens ( with a gun?). A clever writer would have found a way of keeping Batman in the story in some creative way, but this is the same person who wrote BvS and The Rise of Skywalker, so I'm not to surprised. Also, despite being a cold blooded killer in the previous movie, now he's just a rich guy who cracks jokes. It's like they were trying to make him similar to Iron Man, except it does not fit well with what we have been shown before.Wonder Women is extremely boring in this film. She does absolutely nothing but punch and pose most of the time, and this is not helped by the fact that Gal Godot is not a good actress. Her character has no flaws, no character arc, no problems, nothing at all that could make her somewhat interesting. She's just there.Aquaman is another character who does absolutely nothing in this film (Noticing a pattern?). His character can only be described as 'cool guy who shouts a lot'. Other than that, he just punches aliens and throws his trident occasionally. Not much to say there.The Flash in this movie is the worst depiction of the character I have seen in any form of media. They basically turned him into a discount Spider-Man. I think he is supposed to be the comedy relief of the film, except that pretty much everyone is making jokes all the time. They tried to make a father/son relationship with him and Batman, but like everything else in the film, it comes of as forced and annoying.Cyborg is another character who is shoved to the side for most of the runtime. I get it, it's pretty hard to give every character a lot of screen time when you have a main cast of six characters. The thing is though, Cyborg is the only character in the entire movie who has somewhat of an arc. His thing is that he used to be a human but an accident destroyed his body so now he is 95% robot. It is not the most engaging of character arcs, and it's pretty cliche, but I guess it's better than nothing. The problem is, his arc is pretty much forgotten about half way through the film. Maybe the studio simply cut out all his scenes because they were desperate to make sure the film's length was under 2 hours, I don't know.Superman comes back from the dead in the stupidest, most idiotic way possible. And instead of actually doing something captivating with his resurrection, he wakes up confused for a while and then just becomes a hero again. So much wasted potential. Also the terrible CGI mustache does not make things any better.Steppenwolfe is the main villain of the film, and they could not have made a more bland, generic, forgettable villain. His motivation, plan, goals, none of it makes any sense whatsoever. And his terrible design feels, like many have said, something straight out of a video game from fifteen years ago.The fact that Henry Cavil's mustache is not the worst special effect in the film just goes to show how truly horrendous the CGI is. Everything is over saturated, like a Micheal Bay film. The acting is really dull, you can tell most of the actors were really bored. The only redeemable thing about the film is that it's really funny in a so bad it's good way. But good Lord, what an absolute waste of money.",2,3,12,22 April 2020
Kung Fu Panda 2," An Underrated Masterpiece
","In my opinion, Kung Fu Panda 2 is severely underrated. Many seem to prefer the first one over this. However, I completely disagree. The first Kung Fu Panda movie is funny and has a simple story. This film is more emotional and character driven. Whereas the first film was about Po learning Kung Fu, this one focuses more on Po coming to terms with his tragic past.Already the film has done what every sequel should do, giving the main character a new arc. Another thing is the world building. Most of the film takes place in Gongmen City, and the tall buildings and more advanced architecture is a refreshing change to the setting of the first film. It also further develops the Furious Five, especially Tigress, who's friendship with Po grows much stronger over the course of the story.Shen, like Tailong in the first film, is the best character. Unlike Tailong, he does not pose a threat to Po in the physical sense, but rather in a emotional way. It was Shen who massacred Po's village, and ergo created his own greatest enemy. Shen is cold and cruel, and a lot of things he does and says are not what you usually see in a animated film. Shen is a great villain to succeed Tailong and a far more dangerous antagonistic force.Po himself changes. He learns the truth about his tragic past and how he came to be adopted. But Po learns that although his story may not have started out well, his life has become much greater since, which is how he finally gains inner peace by the third act. He is overall a much more mature person than he was in the first movie, although he still has the goofy one liners that are integral to his character.The action in this film is even better than the first film's. The unique locations and stunning color choices along with some of the best action choreography I have ever seen in a kids film all combine together to make gorgeous looking battles. Most of this film takes place during the night time, so the fire and explosions really stand out. Shen himself is a pure white peacock, and he contrasts heavily with his surroundings, making him instantly recognizable in any scene.The soundtrack is also as good as, if not better than, the first film. Here it's less noticeable and more subtle, blending in perfectly with the action. In the third act it really elevates the feeling of suspense. Po standing up to a dozen enemy ships and throwing fireballs by achieving pure peace is my favorite moment during the entire trilogy. His final battle and Shen's defeat are done perfectly.Kung Fu Panda 2 is the Empire Strikes Back of the Kung Fu Panda trilogy. It does everything a sequel needs to and then some more. It is slower paced than the first one, but that is in favor of more emotional beats and better build up. It is a movie that everyone can enjoy and love for many different reasons, and I for one, look forward to revisiting it.",9,0,0,27 May 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The Perfect Animated Movie
","Into the Spider-verse is a film that gets everything right. Characters? Unique and refreshing. Animation? Stellar. Story? Perfection. Music? Wonderful. Comedy? Fantastic. It's impossible to believe that a seventh Spider-Man film and a third origin story can be so creative and amazing, but somehow the brilliant writers behind this movie managed to do it.The story revolves around Miles Morales, a young teenager who gets bitten by a radioactive spider. This character may sound familiar, but the story uses this in a rather clever way. Miles is somewhat similar to Peter Parker, but he has enough personality to hold out on his own. He has a relationship with his father that is the emotional backdrop to the entire story, which is something Peter doesn't have. He does lose his uncle as well, but the death and character are quite different from Peter's.Miles, like any other teenager, is simply trying to find his place in the world, adjust to changes in his body, and try to get a girlfriend. These goals aren't gone when he becomes a superhero, but rather exemplified. He's trying to adjust to changes from the spider bite, he's trying to ask Gwen out, and he's trying to decide how to be a hero. In the end he's taught that there is no secret path to success or perfection, but rather it's a constant road in which you try and try again, always doing your best. Or in other words, 'it's a leap of faith'.But Miles isn't the only character who's great in this film. Peter B. Parker is the old, cranky mentor spider-man. This character is probably the closest we get to the main depiction of Peter Parker. His story on surface might come of as funny, but it's quite tragic when you really think about it. This is a character who's been Spider-Man for over two decades, which is more than half is life. He initially started as enthusiastic, but gradually became more bitter as he grew older. Being Spider-Man cost him his marriage and trapped him into a constant loop of saving people. He has just kept doing what he's always been doing, and now he's sick of it. There's a moment in the film when he mentions he's sick of the line 'with great power must come great responsibility' , showing that he somewhat resents the line that has thrown him in this miserable life. In the end however, he decides that he's going to try again and give things another chance.The other Spider-People don't have character arcs like Peter and Miles, but they all have their moments. Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir are both extremely funny. The kingpin's motive is understandable and his presence intimidating.The animation is truly boundary pushing. Every frame feels alive and full. This is the sort of movie that you have to watch more than once, because there are lots of little Easter eggs, hidden jokes and more constantly lurking in the background. Ang Lee's Hulk tried (and failed) to capture the feel of a comic book through the sloppy editing. In this film, every scene naturally feels like the pages of a comic. The best way to describe it would be: This is a comic brought to life in the most visually stunning way.It's rare for a superhero movie to have jokes that are so cleverly written and well delivered. More than once I burst into laughter through out the course of the story. The comedy feels like a natural part of the story, instead of it being forced or tacked on. The dialogue is equally ingenious.This movie respects the character of Spider-Man by truly understanding what he stands for and how inspiring he could be. It also contains one of Stan Lee's last cameos, which is really touching. It emphasizes on the fact that Spider-Man could be anyone: whether it's an African-american teenager, a middle aged divorcee, a detective who fights Nazis, a girl from the future, or a pig.But this is not just a love letter to Spider-Man, but the entire animation industry as a whole. It proves that there's so much potential and creativity to be gained from animation, and that it must live on. I highly recommend this movie, easily one of the best I've ever seen",9,0,0,7 May 2020
The Lion King," Lifeless
","The only reason I don't give this film a one star is because the CGI was pretty great. You could tell that a lot of hard work had been put in the effects department, and they deserve credit for that. Unfortunately, everything else is pretty bad.The original Lion King is one of the greatest Disney films ever made. I was reluctant to watch this one because I feared that it would not compare to the original. And I was right. This is a dull, lifeless and utterly bland movie. Despite the movie's commitment to be an absolute remake of the original, it completely misunderstands what mad that film so good. The original was energetic, heartfelt and full of life.The plot does not even try to add anything new to the table. It's just the same thing but worse. When watching, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I'm not lying when I say that watching this film was the worst cinema experience I have ever had. There is no justification for it's existence whatsoever.If you have kids, let them watch the original Lion King film. That film had a sense of wonder, and it makes you cry harder than anything. It's beautifully animated and superbly told. This is neither.",2,3,4,11 May 2020
Shrek the Third," Extremely Unfunny
","After thoroughly enjoying the first two Shrek movies, I think it's fair to say that I was quite excited for this one. Sadly, Shrek 3 turned out to be a major let down. I think everyone can agree that this movie is the worst in the franchise. Everything good about the first two films and (to some extent) the fourth one is completely lost here.Lets start with the comedy, which was easily the best part of Shrek 1 and 2. The comedy in those films is more mature than you'd expect and there are a lot of subtle jokes that make a second watch more enjoyable. In this film, most of the comedy consists of loud, obnoxious farts and burps. And I know what you are about to say: It's just a kids movie. But the best part about Shrek 1 and 2 is that they are enjoyed by both adults and kids. I don't see anyone above the age of ten laughing at the comedy in this film.There's the forced princess subplot as well that's thrown in the story. In this subplot the princesses must learn to escape prison on their own. This leads to a female empowerment message. And while it is well intention ed, it also has nothing to do with anything else in the movie. Female empowerment is not necessarily a bad thing, but it has to fit with the themes of the story. Not to mention, the terrible gags during this scene ruin any investment that I had.Shrek himself does not have an arc in this movie. He is worried about having kids, but that isn't taken seriously at all and is (like everything else) just a template for some more bad jokes. We're never even given a good reason for Shrek to not want kids. The same can be said for the other characters in this movie. Donkey and Puss have no purpose in the film other provide some more terrible jokes. And if you think that I'm being to hard on this film, bear in mind that all the side characters in the first two movies had a part to play in the plot.Prince Charming is the least charismatic or threatening villain in the franchise. He wants revenge for what happened in the second movie. The whole time you can tell that the writers were trying to make him more impressive or cool, but he just comes of as a whiny jerk. He even sings at the end of the film, but unlike Fairy Godmother, his voice is truly atrocious.There's not much else to say really. It's the film equivalent of a fart joke. it's probably best to not acknowledge this film's existence and pretend that Shrek is a trilogy. Maybe I'm expecting to much from a kids movie, but the best kids films or shows are ones that all audiences enjoy. A truly great kids movie should be enjoyed by everyone, no matter what their age is. Sadly, the same cannot be said for this movie.",3,0,0,12 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Good ideas, not so good execution.
","My feelings on this movie are very mixed. On one hand I really like some aspects of the film, but there is also some really, really bad stuff in this film. Let's start with the bad.The Bad:
Canto-bite. Out of all the stuff in this film, this subplot feels like something straight out of the prequels. There is a very forced message about animal cruelty in this part of the film, and it does not fit with any of the movie's actual themes. It drags down the pacing of the film significantly and the movie would be a lot more enjoyable without it. It also does not make any sense for Finn, a former storm trooper, to learn about the casualties of war when he should already know about it, considering the events of the previous movie. also, Rose's character and her romance feels very thrown in.While I did like some of the subversion in this move, there were a lot of pointless twists. I feel like this movie would be much improved if Rian Johnson toned it down with the whole 'subverting expectations' thing.The space chase with the empire and the rebellion went on for way to long. about one third of this movie is set during this subplot, and considering the climax of this film takes place on a planet, I feel like they should have cut out a bunch of scenes. It also baffles me how some great scenes like Luke reacting to Han's death were cut out, but scenes like Luke drinking the green milk were kept in.The comedy in this film was also really bad in a lot of places. Many times it detracts from tension, and often it felt like something out of a cartoon. I really do not like these new Star Wars film's bad habit of throwing in cheesy one-liners, many of which feel very reminiscent of a MCU film.The Mixed:
Snoke's death was something I'm not sure how to feel about. On one hand, he was a boring Emperor rip-off and I'm not too fussed that he was killed.On the other hand, it does not make much sense in-universe that Snoke would be so easy to kill, especially when you realize that this was the person who took over most of the galaxy. If he was so easy to kill, then why didn't someone else already do it?The force. While I really do like the idea of using the force in new and different ways, it does not make much sense that a force ghost can use it, and that force ghosts can now touch things. And Luke's force hologram is also something extremely useful, which makes me wonder why he did not use it in the OT.The Battle of Crait. This part of the film has some of the best and worst scenes. Luke's entrance and battle with Ken are both really awe-inspiring, but then you have the terrible scene with Finn and Rose, when they kiss.The Good:
Everything to do with Luke Skywalker is really compelling and beautifully done. His arc in this movie is genuinely heartbreaking, as is also his resentment at the fact that he was such a beloved hero, and that he could never live up to what people wanted him to be. The best role models are the ones who are flawed but heroic, and Luke is very much the both of these. And his death while staring at the twin suns is the perfect way to end his story.Rey and Kylo Ren both have great chemistry and their scenes are really well done. I just wish we had more moments with them, instead of focusing on some of the worse aspects of the film.Everything in the throne room scene is both jaw dropping and intense. From Snoke's death, to the reveal of Rey's parents, to Kylo asking her to join him, to the excellent fight choreography with Ken and Rey, this scene is really good and boosted the entire film.The visual effects and cinematography in general are some of the best from the entire franchise. The scene with Holdo's sacrifice was one of the most beautiful shots I have ever seen.At the end of the day, The Last Jedi is very similar to Luke Skywalker. It is deeply flawed and has it's problems, but is still enjoyable, was an actual director's vision, and, in my opinion, the best of the Sequel trilogy",7,3,13,17 April 2020
Thor," Mediocre
","Thor (2011) feels surprisingly small-scale and simple, much more than I remember it being. This is one of those films that doesn't quite stand the test of time. Back when it first came out I liked it a lot. But watching it again, it struck me as quite formulaic. Everything feels so dull, with no energy whatsoever.The pacing is quite slow, and for the middle chunk of the film nothing much happens other than a really bland love story. Thor and Jane just have no chemistry at all and it's hard to care about their relationship. The humor is okay, not particularly funny but serviceable. Loki is alright. He's interesting enough, but Tom Hiddleston hasn't quite got the charisma that he had in the Avengers film. Here, he is just your typical villain.The plot is exactly what you'd expect from a Thor movie, with no unexpected elements that could keep you interested. The action is pretty entertaining, but nothing more. The actors are doing an okay job. Again, everything about this movie is average and mediocre, nothing more or less. It's not good enough for me to say that I highly enjoyed it, but not bad enough for me to laugh at it.The special effects are pretty good, especially for the time. If you compare the CGI of this movie with Green Lantern, (which came out the same year) then it's quite impressive. But perhaps the biggest fault with this film is that it's uninteresting. The premise is promising, but in execution this movie hardly delivers. It's fun, but I can hardly see myself re-watching it.",5,0,0,13 May 2020
Joker," A Breath of Fresh Air From Your Usual Hollywood Film
","In my opinion, Joker did not quite live up to expectations. The amount of hype this movie received was insane, and it would have been quite hard for the film to be as good as I was hoping it would be. Despite my slight disappointment however, I still really enjoyed this movie.Arthur Fleck's character and his arc are both tragic and moving. Taking the concept of the Joker, a character who is commonly portrayed as a chaotic evil villain, and turning him into a sympathetic person was quite daring. One thing I especially liked was how Arthur's fall into villainy took it's time and was built up on a lifetime of cruelty and mistreatment, instead of a singular incident being the cause of his evil.Joker also did a good job in setting the grim mood of the film with it's depiction of Gotham City. The dull grey color palette and the ominous soundtrack at the start of the story really added to the overall affect. As the film progresses the weather becomes brighter and the soundtrack becomes more upbeat to indicate what Arthur Fleck is feeling. These little touches make the atmosphere more real and alive.It goes without saying that Joaquin Phoenix did a spectacular job. I had no doubt he would win that Oscar. While I did not enjoy his performance as much as Heath Ledger's Joker, Phoenix's Joker is completely unique and memorable. Doubtless this film wouldn't have been as enjoyable as it was without Phoenix. He is a spectacular actor and I look forward to watching some of the other films he's been in.The story is quite slow-paced, but I was never bored. Arthur's sympathetic character and the city he lives in were quite gripping and hooked me for most of the story. It was slowly building up to a climax, and when the third act did finally arrive I was not disappointed. The final thirty minutes of the movie were almost perfect.There are a couple of things that annoy me about this film, such as the unnecessary inclusion of Bruce Wayne and the extreme lack of subtlety. Bruce Wayne does not really have a place in this plot and his scenes were basically just fan service. I like the ironic twist that Joker ended up creating his own enemy, but it detracts from the main focus of Arthur's story.I also wish that the movie was a tad more subtle in it's message. Subtlety isn't necessary in good film making, but this movie forces the message down your throat, without leaving anything for your audience to figure out for themselves. These problems, in my opinion, hold it back from being a true masterpiece. Still, it is a great film and I look forward to watching it again.",8,0,2,30 April 2020
Thor: The Dark World," A Big Pile of Nothing
","A while ago I watched all the marvel movies in the MCU. For the most part, the films range from mediocre to actually pretty good. Thor 2 might be the only one that I disliked. To be clear, I don't have strong feelings towards this movie at all. It's just dull to watch.The acting isn't bad, but none of the actors add anything to their roles. Natalie Portman has proven that she can be great, but in this movie she is just annoying. Her character is the stereotypical love interest who's there because studios think you have to have a girlfriend in every superhero movie. No wonder Natalie Portman decided to skip out on Thor 3.Chris Hemsworth himself has said that he does not like this movie, and it's easy to see why. Thor has no arc in this film at all, and nothing unique or interesting that makes a character gripping. The only thing in this movie that could have been emotional was his mother's death. The problem is, Thor has never had a proper relationship with his mother, and the audience is never given a reason to care about her death. Even Thor does not seem to care that his mother died. He's a bit sad but gets over it in a couple of minutes.The film tries to give the side characters some personality, but I still struggle to remember their names. Most of them are the comic relief sidekicks, and that's the extent of their role in the film. The main villain, Maliketh, is about as bad as a villain you can get in a superhero movie. He want's to take over the universe for no reason, check. He is after some MacGuffin, check. He has a completely uninteresting design and voice, check. The actor who played Maliketh said that he hated the role, and had no idea what his character was supposed to be.Then there's the other two side characters. Kat Dennings and Stellen Skarsguard. Kat Dennning's character is another annoying comic relief. Eric Selvig went from wise old man to crazy old man in between the films. The first shot of him in the film is him naked in front of live TV, which I guess is supposed to be a joke.The plot is also extremely by the numbers. Nine planets will align and the bad guy will use the MacGufffin to destroy the world, blah blah blah. Then Thor shows up just in the nick of time to save the world with the help of Natalie Portman and then learns some lesson. The end. It's also utterly pointless in the story of the MCU. Just read the Wikipedia plot summary and you'll get about the same amount of enjoyment as you would if you actually watched the film.",2,0,1,5 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A fun film, but gets worse the more you think abot it
","TFA is an ok film. Personally, I do not hate it, like many do. When I first watched the movie i genuinely loved it. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that gets worse the more you think about it.Rey is not an interesting character. Not because she is a mary-sue or because she is a woman or anything like that. It's just that I do not find her character very interesting. She is not in the story because she chose to be in it, but because other characters drag her into it. She does not even have a proper arc. I honestly find the side characters and the villans far more interesting than her. Kylo Ren had a lot of potential and so did Finn.The plot is not exactly a retread of a new hope, but it does borrow a lot of story elements. There are some ideas that could lead to some good stories, but the main plot is way to similar to A New Hope. Again, this movie is enjoyable if you shut of your brain when watching it, but I wish we had a more unique story that did not rely on the original trilogy.",6,6,14,17 April 2020
Deadpool," Enjoyable Experience
","Deadpool is a unique nut ultimately flawed movie. It's a nice middle finger to the standard superhero genre, but, other than that, it does not have much substance.Don't get me wrong. I like the jokes. I like the gore and the meta humor. But I also want an engaging story. The whole film is your run of the mill, average story with some engaging sequences. The effects haven't aged well, but that's excusable with the budget it has. The side characters and the opening title sequence are pretty subversive, and so is the end credits scene.But if the only thing holding up the movie is the comedy and the R rating, then that's not enough. This film tries to make fun of superhero tropes and use them as well. You can't have keep your cake but also try to eat it. Either be a generic film or be a complete subversion of the genre.The first action sequence at the beginning is by far the best one. In fact, every action sequence after it is kind of a letdown comparatively. The villain was pretty weak, but serviceable.I don't hate this movie, I just feel like it's wasted potential. They could have done a lot more than this. I am still glad that this movie made a lot of money, and I'm glad it had a large impact. I hope that, as time goes on, we get more super-hero movies that are rated R and try something that hasn't been done before. I hope more studios will be confident enough to give filmmakers more freedom to tell unique stories. At the end of the day, I'm more glad of the impact this film had rather than the film itself",6,0,1,17 May 2020
