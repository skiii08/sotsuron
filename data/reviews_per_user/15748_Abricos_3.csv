Deepwater Horizon," One of the best thrillers I have seen!
","I really liked how the tension was build. It was very gripping. I watched it very carefully and the whole movie from the very beginning to the very end was interesting to watch.I really liked the details, they let to get into the movie even more and made the feelings sharper!The technical part in my, film making enthusiast, opinion was good enough and no flaws there. It did look spectacular overall.",10,1,3,26 June 2017
RED," An empty and flat movie.
","Action scenes and combat were good enough for me. Marvin Bogs (actor: John Malkovich) was nicely characterized and it was delightful to watch him. But even his characterization had its own flaws.The first bad thing that caught my eye was Frank's calmness and exorbitant 'coolness'. He was being assaulted by 2 SWAT squads, however, it felt like he didn't even worry, as if he was invaded a 100 times in the past and it is casual for him. Not only that assault should've been alerting, there were multiple situations, where anyone would get sweaty hands. His past was told very briefly. It wasn't enough to convince me, that he can act cool in those situations.Directing had many flaws. The very first minutes of the movie felt really weird. Frank woke up at exactly 6:00 without any alarm, if that is not unrealistic enough, he woke up like 'a robot', that was unnatural. Also when Sarah had tape on her mouth in the car, she could've easily removed it, as her hands were tied in front of her. That is minor, but still caught my eye. The way Frank exited the car was really weird and unrealistic.Characterization lacked reason and was inadequate. Not only franks boldness was exaggerated, but while he appeared to be 'professional', he fell in love with Sarah, a woman he has never seen in real life. Is he a teen? Sarah itself had little characterization, which had no reason. She was in shock, which should've rankled her. However, she later joins Frank's company with alacrity. Also, their love was 'technical'. No emotions, no romance.Marvin was a funny and interesting personality and he was characterized as very aware. The characterization on him was done well, however it had no influence to the main story. His abilities to detect threat didn't appear to have any effect in the end. Good, but useless characterization.It was hard to understand the story itself, due to lack of origins for the events and actions. A lot of things lacked reason.I lacked subtle, but influential details, which always buys my attention.At least is wasn't a torment to watch the movie, but it had too many flaws.",4,1,3,19 November 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Very gripping modern movie.
","Turns out that it was much better than I expected. Extremely well made action, fighting scenes are unique and cinematography, in my eyes, looks great. Modern movies sometimes have a weak part of irritating cliché. However, in this movie, I noticed that it makes the cliché it's strong part. Not only pointing it out directly, but in making things remarkably unique.I really love movies where there is something unfinished left at the end and it is being solved with style, and that smug feeling in the viewers eyes. This movie did it twice!However, I missed some deeper characterization of the main roles. It took so long for her to make that jump. They could've took that further later in the movie. He didn't shoot the dog. Why? Have I missed something?",9,1,2,25 August 2017
