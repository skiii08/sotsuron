Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Masterpiece misunderstood
","I think it makes not so much sense to think about Star Wars sequels that for example Return Of The Jedi is the best, next comes The Empire Strikes back, then Attack Of The Clones etc. It is true that Phantom Menace is very different from the 'earlier' episodes but I think that is  quite refreshing. Who ever liked to eat the same food at every meal every day of the year...I myself think Phantom Menace is a true masterpiece. It has the same emotional charge as there is in the Attack Of The Clones but the former is not loaded with the same techno myopia and hectisism that to my opinion somewhat spoils the latter. The athmosphere is very moving especially concerning Anakin Skywalker and his relationship with his mother, Padme and the jedi order. To the very end you keep marveling this young boys sensitivity, daring and brilliance as he goes against the enormous odds to make life better to everyone he loves.I find (mostly) peaceful rhythm of events compared to the other sequels and additional romanticism in this film very delighting. Also battle scenes seem to fit much better to the whole film than in Episode 2 and the new weapon arsenal is very interesting.The reputation of this film is too much unjustly maligned and most people seem to miss the fact that the film fits quite perfectly to the overall picture of Star Wars. I think this film really is worth your time.",10,1,2,30 August 2002
Insomnia," A really distinctive detective story
",This is more than an ordinary thriller or detective story which Hollywood produces by the dozens these days. I surely like this kind a bit original thriller that has done something for its plot.Al Pacino is great as meticulous detective Dormer. I think you just got to love his relaxed way of acting. However there is much more in detective Dormers character than meets the eye. Robin Williams also does a great role in this film. I personally think his character is one of the best you ever see in these thrillers. His character is also one you should not judge at first sight.This is really a moving story about human motivation. A look into the human mind and what a human is capable of. In the end you wonder just how you got there.Personally I find the lack of too much violence especially delighting. I think you should not make a thriller (or any other kind of movie) if you got nothing else to offer but violence. There are in this film some rough scenes however so I would not recommend this to the youngest in the family.,10,0,0,29 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Masterpiece with myopia
",The force is not with this film as strongly as with its famous predecessors. I think the story itself is good but the execution is not as impressive as in previous episodes. I find the romance between Anakin and Padme the most moving part in this film. In my opinion the film fits well to the overall Star Wars context. Generally however you get the impression that the audience is somewhat ignored and makers suffer from some kind of techno myopia. A bit too hectic to my taste but nevertheless a very good film.,9,1,1,17 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A liberal piece of the masterpiece
","I think this film is a little overtly praised by the audience. The story is interesting, technical execution of the scenes is fantastic and the actors are some of the best actors of our times. Nevertheless something is missing.I think J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord Of The Rings (Fellowship Of The Ring) one of the greatest books ever written and I was not overtly enjoyed as I found out that Peter Jackson had somewhat spoiled the filmation of this masterpiece.
Perhaps the most annoying thing is the unnecessary scenes with Arwen in this film as she comes meddling with the pursuit of Frodo Baggins by the nazgul. I think this scene really is 'a little' too liberal an interpretation of Tolkiens masterpiece and to my opinion greatly disturbs the 'big picture'.Furthermore I think the excellent pursuit of Frodo by the ring wraiths in the book is not in whole very well executed in this film here. I find it very disappointing that the director has decided to take a shortcut with the filmation just here. Also the idea of the relationship of Saruman and the uruk hai is a little too liberal interpretation by the director and I myself dont find it too delighting one.On the positive side the battle scenes are great in this film. I myself don`t find this film very suitable for young children to watch because of the overall violence included.To Jacksons credit I think that he has remained fairly loyal to the book and if you can ignore the few burdensome details above you really are going to enjoy this movie.",1,4,9,1 September 2002
Signs," A somewhat disappointing 'really scary movie'
","I think this film is a great horror film. If you are a more sensitive person, you just keep watching over your shoulder some time after seeing it.
In the beginning the plot in the film is quite interesting and I was enjoying myself seeing it. The 'feeling' of this movie is really scary. In the end however I ended up somewhat disappointed about the overall plot. I think it just was not developed to its very best and it was just too elusive. After the great start I was just expecting more.
This film has reached somewhat similar 'really scary' feeling as in my opinion 'What lies beneath'. However it lacks the great plot of the latter and I myself vote it 8.",8,0,1,27 September 2002
