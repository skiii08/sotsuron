It," Epic fail!
","As someone who was a child when the original came out, I know how great of a movie this was. I have no clue what this garbage is that I was watching. After the first 30 minutes, I'd had more than enough torture and turned it off. Beverly acting like a prostitute in training, cutting her hair off, the kids making sexual jokes and using profanity, a totally weird looking Penny Wise, and various other ridiculous occurrences I'm sure I very fortunately missed....this movie is an insult to Stephen King, as well as time wasted on this film that we can never get back.",Null,6,9,17 January 2018
