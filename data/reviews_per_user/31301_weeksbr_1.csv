Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," People don't know what they're saying when they say the Prequels are crap.
","Star Wars fans are never satisfied. After all, it's George Lucas' story and he knows where it was supposed to go and end up. Sure the prequels are different than the original, but they are just as well done.People who hate the prequels don't know what great story telling and cinema is. They just want everything to be exactly the same.",10,3,6,19 December 2019
