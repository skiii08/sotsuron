Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Two minor flaws
","I am trying to review this movie without any spoilers this time. Let's begin with one of the only things I did not like in the movie: Jar Jar's character. It is well-done how he and the Gungans speak, but his moves and 'humourous' character somehow does not fit in the movie, despite this one is supposed to be the 'most peaceful' of all the previous SW movies. It is also one minor flaw that the characters have apparent fluke. If I were to detail it, I would have to add spoilers, which I don't desire. Watch the film or recall what you have seen and you will see what I mean. Go to the positive part this time: In the movie, the long forgotten Sith return and the Sith Apprentice confront Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. For those who still have not yet seen the film: Qui-Gon Jinn is the master of Obi-wan, who is still an apprentice. The Sith Lord vs. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fight scene is probably the culmination of the events and this part is done the best. We will also see the Jedi in 'normal' combat against droids, which show how Jedi can fight. The plot is based around a conflict on a peaceful planet named Naboo, which the Trade Federation blockaded for various reasons. By the will of the Force, the two Jedi get stranded down on Tatooine, where they discover Anakin Skywalker, who actually helps them escape the planet. We will see a long 'pod race' scene on Tatooine, which could be amazing or damn boring, depending on your attitude to speed. I liked this part of the film the first time I saw it, but I normally skip this when I am to watch the film over again on VHS. When the final attack starts to retake the planet, the events are divided into three parts: We can see all three emerge victorious at various costs. Expect to see an awesome ground battle between Trade Federation droids and the natives of Naboo, in an open and wide area.The two flaws I mentioned above make me consider this film 'only' 9 out of 10. I was more forgiving in the case of Episode III, simply because I better liked the fight scenes in that movie, which is not a shame from the aspect of the Phantom Menace. While this movie is focused on one single conflict, Episode III is not only about a conflict, it's about a galaxy-wide fought war. For this reason, it is no wonder we cannot see as much fight as we do in Episode III or even II.To sum up the whole, the Phantom Menace is a good movie, with some minor flaws. The movie is safe to be watched by children of any age, too.If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste any more time! It's highly recommended.",9,0,1,23 May 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Below expectations, but still good
","*Contains spoilers*Reading some of the reviews, I could conclude that most of you(respect to the exceptions) are disenchanted about this movie. I can agree with some of the points, like a Predator teaming up with a Human, but that did not annoy me up as much as the fact I mention below:This is where this becomes a spoiler: I do not understand and I do not even want to know why this movie degraded Predators so much. I can't believe that one Alien killed two Predators and the third(and the last one) gets 'facehuggered' a good ten minutes after the fight begins.Talking about face-huggers, I also find it strange that Aliens evolve way too quickly. It must be a result of the Director's decision on how to make the movie more whirling. Aliens birth quickly, OK, but what about the 'fecundated' Predator? How come it survived for so long? Also a note on Alien life-cycle: How is that possible that the Xenomorph births from a Dead body? I obviously mean the Italian guy(don't know the name) and the Predator.I loved how the Predators looked like at any rate. The one last thing I did not like about Predators in this movie is their vision modes. Why did not they leave the old-style Predator mask sound? That was the best. One other thing: I find the into part VERY long, it is even longer than the action part itself with the Credits.To sum up a whole, I had really loved this movie despite all what I wrote.",8,1,2,22 January 2005
War of the Worlds," Despite all the negative reviews.
","First of all, I have seen the trailer of this movie, which did not give me any negative or positive prejudices about the movie. Making an interesting movie and an interesting trailer are two completely different things. Like catching fish with a net and shooting insects with a shotgun. All I knew about the movie, seeing the trailer is that the world is in despair, everyone is panicked.I walked into the cinema and sat down watching the movie. The introductory narration did not ignite much interest in me, I think the text of the narrator was not told in an interesting way. Okay, I have reached the point when I have to mention that I did not see the original English version, but the dubbed Hungarian one, so whatever I am going to say about dialogues could be the fault of the translation.Starting to watch the film, I realized the movie takes after the novel called White Mountains. I read that book in an overly simplified version, so I was unsure how similar the movie will be to that novel. I knew what the Tripods are and I knew the solution how they can be destroyed. I was just hoping the will be another solution... or the film will have a bad ending, which I would have preferred. There were differences between the novel and the movie, that is for sure. The film is much more depressing and darker.I found some dialogues and scenes humorous, especially before the alien's arrival. Mainly when Cruiser throws out the window with the baseball ball. I not only smiled like I did with other jokes: I started launching silently. Then the film turned sinister. The bad guys emerged and the mindless escaping began. It is only my opinion, that the sounds the Tripods made were too noisy. The fact that I found them noisy is perhaps I am not used to loudness so much. I did not give any bad marks for this, I just wanted it worth noting.So, panic. I noticed only one mistake in the film: When the EMP shock-wave deactivated all electronics, I still saw people taking photos about the Tripods. I don't think any believable explanation can be given why only the cameras worked. It probably has something to do with advertising annihilation. :DI found the feeling to be scary, to use some informal English slang. The scene when the alien scout 'snake' enfiladed the basement was okay, but when the Aliens arrived... it scared me. I don't remember any movies that made me fear while watching. I was hoping to do this by AvP when I watched that movie, but was not expecting that exactly this film will scare me.As for the finale, I did not like that either. It may be because I am malicious that I wanted Robee(spellng?) to die, so when he appeared in Boston made me a little disappointed. The explanation in the end was not clear enough, it did tell what caused the doom of the invaders but it did not clarify how, which I think is more important or almost as important.In overall, the movie was good enough. If you have noticed I did not say much good about the movie, this is my style of writing a review. I don't usually mention things I liked unless they are extraordinary. I am not sure whether I will watch it again, on VHS on DVD at best, I assume I will. This movie will not gain any special awards, it only showed to me, that Spielberg is not esteemed for nothing. I respect his achievements, even though I saw only a couple of his films.I rate it 8 out of 10. If it were not for the sudden ending and the unclear explanation, it would be 9 out of 10.",8,0,1,21 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Excellent movie
","To start with, I am one of the very few who liked the two previous movies, The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones. It did not come as a surprise for me that I liked this movie. I want to see this as soon as possible, for the second, third, fourth..... twenty-seven millionth time! OK, the 27 million times is an exaggeration, excuse me.BE WARNED: This review DOES contain spoilers.The fight scenes were most excellent, amazing and spectacular. There are a lot of special effects, which looked realistic to me, the saber fights were quick, spectacular, reminded me of the special abilities of the Jedi. They are fast and deadly, as seen in the first part of the movie(*). Anakin's movements and his fight with Count Dooku were very good. I regret that there was no more time for their duel and Anakin did not kill him on his complete own. When they escaped from the falling elevator, it reminded me James Bond! I was one of the best moments in the entire movie. The space battle at the beginning was better than the one we saw at the Battle of Endor(I dare say this). The worlds which were displayed almost stopped my heart beating. Fantastic. The battles between the Clone troopers and the Droids gave a fantastic feeling, especially the one in where Grievous got killed. Now, let's talk about what I did not like: (*) = The Jedi got killed way too easily. I can't believe that Ki-Adi Mundi could fend off three blaster shots and got killed by a fourth one. He is a member of the Jedi Council and is it the best of his knowledge? Kit Fisto also suffered a quick death in the fight with Palpatine, which I find hard to believe. How can anyone, even Palpatine kill FOUR Jedi knights(among them Mace Windu, the best saber-wielder in the galaxy) in a single fight? The two other Jedi knights were not even able to fend off a single parry and Windu's death was disappointing. I would have preferred if he got killed by Anakin in a face-to-face duel. Poor Secura Aayla, she did not even notice the situation when she got a blast to the back. Why I say all this: The Jedi 'youngster' who defended Bail Organa from the republic clones fended off more shots than any of the three Jedi mentioned above combined(Kit Fisto, Ki-Adi Mundi and Secura Aayla). Perhaps it is this child who was the chosen one? Poor youngster fought well, but got shot, which is understandable considering he is a mere apprentice. OK, let's get back to the Main characters: Padmé's acting was good, but the dialog written for her was not first class, which is true. I felt sorry for this couple when Anakin choked Padmé. In retrospect, I don't think it was feasible that Obi-wan defeated Anakin in the saber fight on the lava planet(I don't know how it is exactly spelled, so I omit to mention its name). It was so disturbing to see the Chosen one suffer from the heat and Obi-wan suffer from what he was seeing.",10,3,7,22 May 2005
