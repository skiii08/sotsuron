Iron Man 3," One, Two,Three - You're out
","Iron Man 3 is very different to the previous films. I really like the way the plot revolves around the aftermath of the Avengers film and it's effect on Tony Stark. There's lots else that's good, a bit more time for character development and some really mean bad guys this time around.As part of the franchise Iron Man is really now only competing with itself and this time, I think it's met it's match. Given the way the ending ties up, it looks like the producers have finally laid their swords on the table too.It's a good film to watch at the start of the US blockbuster season. It won't disappoint.. well maybe except for some of the inconsistencies (shared in other reviews here) regarding the abilities of the suits which seem to be far more fragile in this film.And then there's that embarrassing continuity problem that brings you out of fantasy land altogether whenever superheroes blow up. Come on! When you design bad guys who can turn into 3000 degree fires and explode and then rebuild themselves, why do they always seem to be wearing pants again when they walk out of the fire? Don't they know that fabric burns too? Whoops.ZM",6,4,8,1 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Finally, story over smash and bash is back in style
","First the Avengers and now this.After 15 years it seems story is finally back in style for superhero films. After so long with each film year after year trying to beat the last with it's bangs, effects, wow factor ad not much else.I've always measured the greatness of films by considering whether (or not) I would want to sit through a film again. A 'Favorite' film of course I can watch dozens of times, etc.Before TASM, I cant think of a single superhero flick that's been released in the past 10 years that I have wanted to see again. At best I could get my gratification by watching a crucial five minutes but never be bothered sitting through the whole thing.TASM (despite its length) is a film I could sit through again - end to end. On so many levels it works and that's because there's attention to detail. Yes there's still those stupid unbelievable moments (now come on.. a lizard and a toilet?) but on the most part finally TASM puts science back into SciFi. The story tries so hard to explain why things are the way they are and watching this unfold (without having to tax the mind through plot twists) is entertaining indeed.TASM works because the hero is limited. Rules have been set as to what Spidey can (and can't) do and the producers have rigidly stuck by that rule book. That's something that was sadly lacking in the previous Spidey franchise where so much stuff went on without any explanation at all, every time the third act just became too unbelievable and any illusion was destroyed.TASM explores so many aspects that the original franchise either didn't want to touch or couldn't be bothered to because they were so busy proving they had the best special effects for the given week when they were produced. In TASM, you get the idea that it wouldn't matter what the effects looked like, the film would still stand up on it's own and be entertaining. It'll be a hard one to sequel.And the best thing is.. it really didn't cost that much to make now, did it guys. Geez 20 years ago we Aussies were making superflicks in this category for for $40m and we thought that was a lot of dosh. Then came Kevin Costly and his $200m flop and that seemed to set a new bench mark for how to waste insane sums of money in film that everyone has followed since.Now here's a superflick that cost less in todays' money than that Kevin Costly crap did 15 years ago and will easily make that back four times worldwide even if it doesn't win the US box office this week. All because they told a story instead of just making another long music video.I'm glad I lived long enough to see that there's still hope for superflicks. TASM (and The Avengers before it) will hopefully become part of a new breed that will finally sweep away the crap and result in films which anyone, anywhere can sit down and enjoy, end to end - just like the super hero flicks of long ago.ZM",8,3,6,8 July 2012
Captain America: Civil War," The first Superhero movie with no villain
","No doubt about it, this film is something new that has never been done before. And it is done with elegance, sophistication and intelligence. For this CA:CW is the first superhero film ever created that effectively has no 'baddie' in it.Now that's a milestone in the genre because as we all know, it's generally the quality of the villain (not the hero) which defines how successful a hero flick will be in the marketplace.CA:CW sets out more like a bond film than a hero flick. Espionage and politics reign supreme and for a while there, it can be difficult to follow for many of us film goers used to letting hero flicks 'just wash over us' without having to use our brains.But have patience punters during the first hour because it DOES all come together wonderfully in the end and there are very few strings left untied by credit roll time.CA:CW takes the new 'post modern, human hero' thing to a new level. Finally, we see that these heroes can and do have their limits. They CAN be beaten, they DO get hurt. I guess when you're in the Marvel universe and have so many of them, you can afford to lose some along the way.The biggest surprise (SPOILER ALERT!) is how the whole film builds to make us think there is about to be a typical showdown between the Avengers and a group of mysterious 'baddies' - only to find that these so called 'baddies' have all now been taken out with a single shot each as they lay in their beds! As with most Marvel Universe stuff, this film builds a framework for future films yet to come.CA:CW is the film that you and I always dreamed of having been made when we watched these things as kids. We would all just sit there and wonder how these heroes would survive in real life, and wish that someone would just 'take out' the baddie for us quick smart so the rest of the movie could then give us an insight into the hero's loves, lives and the way they manage being heroes in a complex world.Despite the slow and complex start, CA:CW will not disappoint. However the more Marvel make this kind of stuff, the more they put these characters in straight jackets for future films. I guess they don't care because when it comes to Stan Lee, there's plenty of heroes out there still 'in the can' yet to open up.Oh and one more thing : Designed by Owen Paterson! ANOTHER Aussie LEGEND (most well known for designing the Matrix films) and from the same mold as Colin Gibson (most recently winning big time for Mad Max / Fury Road). Good on ya mate.. no less than total world domination will do now eh. Maybe we should include Captain Invincible?...ZM",8,13,29,1 May 2016
Moulin Rouge!," Well it was good enough for an Oscar wasn't it?
","OK so here we go, another review of a film I also worked on. I was the head Art Dept Electrician on this film, meaning just about every light globe you see in every frame (and there are certainly a lot, possibly more than any other film in history) was put there either by myself or one of the four others on my team. But enough of that.In production, Moulin was a film where few crew knew what the film was about until we sat and watched it at the preview 12 months later. Both then and now, it blows my mind to watch such an enjoyable, indulgent and extravagant production - one of the few I can think of where the viewer really gets to see so much of what happened in front of the camera.For an art department crew member, watching a film you've worked on is so often like watching life through a keyhole. You know there was so much there but so little of it can ever be seen in the final cut. Not with 'Moulin Rouge'! Watching Every frame, every word, every song is like soaking yourself in a bath of creativity where there were no rules or if there was, they were often invisible.The Oscar (won for Best Production design) is rightly claimed. Whilst the performances, music and cinematography are all excellent, it's the unique designs that really jump out of the screen throughout the entire film. The success of 'Moulin' as an artistic masterpiece is testament to the Australian way of film making, where art comes by way of cooperation, communication and a common drive to deliver the cast and director the best environment possible in which to present the story and performance. It's a long way from the 'Frustrated Incorporated' way of working so common to American productions where time constraints often lead to sub standard results.So why an 8 and not a 10? 'Moulin Rouge' in the end fell victim to Fox Studios Australia, displacing the production in May 2000 in favour of George Lucas' Star Wars prequel. As a result of this two major key sets were demolished well before time and well before it was possible to create the necessary special effect shots needed to bring the film to reality.This resulted in the construction of a number of additional scale models (at another studio) which were inevitably used for these mo-con shots - and resulted in the famed 'longest mo con shots in film for this week'.To most viewers, Moulin seems fine. But to me, and despite enormous effort to prevent it, the continuous multitude of continuity and lighting errors that abound in 'Moulin' (where scenes cut back and forth from the real life to the model sets) is an ever present annoyance, preventing me from ever fully entering the director's intended world as it was planned to be. For this reason, Moulin will never be what it could have been - and stands as a warning to anyone who plans to outstay their welcome at a Fox studio.Still, it was good enough for an Oscar, and I guess (being in the department that earned it that Oscar) I should be (and am) satisfied. I do sometimes wonder what it might have looked like though had the producers gone ahead with their initial plans to build a full size outdoor back lot, thus avoiding the troubles at Fox and obviating the need for all that expensive mucking about with scale models afterwards.Moulin was a wild ride (both on and off screen) and I'll never forget it.And I guarantee, neither will you.Enjoy.",8,1,2,26 December 2011
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avenger Soup
","The first Avengers film was such a success. It contained one of the most momentous cinematic moments of all time - The Hulk's efficient destruction of the villain.. 'Puny god!' Never before have I heard a cinema erupt in such cheers. Nor am I ever likely to hear since.So the expectations on this edition were very high. But unfortunately this film shows how hard it is to write a script containing multiple superheroes and be fair to each one of them. Inevitably it comes down to having a good villain who can beat them all - and here lies the Achilles heel of the Avengers property. How to give them something worthy of winning against.So how to create a worthy adversary without introducing an alien? Have the Avengers create their own villain. Well, almost.Right from the first frame the film is definitely The Avengers with equal time given to all of Our Heroes. The story is strong, twisty and challenging. All good so far.Then.. inject a super villain who has the power to mess with the Avengers' minds. Whoops.By the second act, the film has degenerated into an unrecognizable series of dreams, flashbacks and flash forwards. Soon it becomes impossible to tell which one is which. You look around the darkened cinema, catching the eye of other equally confused viewers. Before long, it becomes apparent that almost everyone around you has whispered 'what the &*$# is going on? Thankfully this film DOES eventually get back on the rails. By the third act, we're back in true Avengers territory and it all ends happily ever after in true Avengers style.Stick in there. Make sure you watch right to the very end, well after the credits have rolled. There are a few moments where the film tries to emulate the first, but overall the Age of Ultron brings together the hobble of heroes we had in the first film and prepares it for greater things to come in following editions.This edition of The Avengers certainly won't be the favorite of most. It's largely disjointed. Kind of like trying to watch eight different movies at the same time. It would have got an 8 - if it weren't for that 40 minutes in the middle wasted trying to work out what the heck was going on.Barely a minute goes by without the cinemas' sub woofers getting a workout. This is The Avengers, after all.Great classic Marvel stuff, right down to Stan Lee's cameo. But please.. in the next edition, let's get some new blood on the Directors' table if we need to do flashbacks or jump from one reality to the next.",4,4,12,3 May 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," It finally happened
","OK. here we go again. Reviewing a movie to which I was a bit too close.Never have I seen a movie that so polarizes the viewer. You will either love or hate this flick.Lets set the scene. This movie was largely dreamed up in the late 1990's,when George was producing the Babe sequel in Sydney. Working alongside him on the pleasant 'Babe Pig in the City' were the other two notables that laid the foundation of Fury Road: Production Designer Colin Gibson and (while some may argue with me on this) Chief Mechanic (and partner in crime) Mark Mc Kinley.By the early '00s the location had changed to Namibia (which put it out of my reach) and production had actually commenced over there. Then came ....9/11.The Mad Max project was immediately mothballed. It was felt that such a film would not be critically accepted so close to such a cataclysmic loss in the US. It took another 10 years before Fury Road would finally rise to the top of the pond again.As much as you read MM:FR as George's film it was always Gibson's baby. Colin had done so much for George in the past. He stuck it out with Miller when everyone else had long lost patience and left. MM:FR was George's way of finally letting his kids into the lolly shop.MM:FR has Gibson and McKinley written all over it. So much so that some times I wonder if George even had anything to do with the film at all. That could be why the film polarizes viewers so easily.MM:FR is what happens when the crew get to make the film THEY want to make while the director sleeps it off somewhere. And it stands as testimony to that and that alone. From the earliest days of Gibson's work on 'Reckless Kelly' and 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert', MM:FR is the culmination of all those pub discussions that have happened since. The 'Wouldn't it be cool if we could do this...' moments.And now they have. In Mad Max, Fury Road.It's perhaps no coincidence that the abbreviation MM:FR is so similar to another one of Gibson's early films, MM:PR ('Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'). Viewers of one are likely to like the other. They both represent what happens in film making when you pull out all the stops, let things freewheel, and just allow everyone to go mad..When it comes to Mad Max Fury Road my advice is to go into the cinema with the same attitude that the film makers had when they made it.'Go hard or go home'!! P.S. I met and first worked with Colin Gibson on the aforementioned 1995 vintage Power Rangers movie (which at the time was the film that I WANTED TO MAKE). Now Colin you finally got to make the film that YOU WANTED TO MAKE.Well done mate.We can all retire now.Paul M",10,2,8,1 January 2016
