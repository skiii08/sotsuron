","I really enjoyed this movie.I went in with mixed feelings and the fear that this would be a typical horrible Hollywood remake, well it wasn't.
I love this story and I was really looking forward to the remake.
With all of today's technology and the real life location shots, I was expecting spectacular. What I got was a dud.
This film is beautiful. The scenes, the gloom, the wastelands are all very well done.
As a fan of Blade Runner. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I enjoyed it immensely and will absolutely watch it again.",5,1,4,27 November 2018
