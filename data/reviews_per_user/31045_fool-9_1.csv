Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good but not the best
","I would say that 'The Phantom Menace' is a Good film but no more. It was obvious that it would not be the best of the Star Wars films. A Character named Jar Jar ruins the movie. As unbelievable as it may seem, He is MORE annoying that C-3PO was in the Originals. If He is in Episode II, than it would be good to see him die! Another thing that ruins the movie is the unfunny jokes and the repetition of the Words 'Youpi'and 'Ani'(for Anakin) one too many times. Without that, the movie would have been as good as Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back or The Return of the Jedi. It is evident that with a main character as a hero the movie becomes quite immature at times although it is well balanced out by the Lightsaber fights and it should be less evident in Episode II and III as Anakin gets older.",7,0,0,23 May 1999
