Saturday Night Fever," Good movie about disco
","Rated R for strong language, sexuality/nudity, drug content and some violence.Saturday Night Fever was John Travolta's breakthrough film.After this film and Grease, he would not be famous again until Pulp Fiction in 1994.There are two versions of Saturday Night Fever.The original R-rated version and an edited PG version which is hard to find on VHS(not released on DVD) but is the one which is used for the edited for TV version of Fever.It is cut by approx 6min.Anyway Travolta's acting is very good in this film and the storyline is pretty good as well.A bit boring at times but the soundtrack is excellent.I actually bought the soundtrack a couple of years ago.The film is about a young man living in Brooklyn.Everyday, him and his friends go to a disco to hang around and dance.Travolta is a very good disco dancer.One day him and this girl he likes try to win the dance competition which is being held there.Saturday NIght Fever is an interesting film which portrays disco in the 1970's.This is actually the film which helped popularize disco.Worth watching.",9,1,2,1 October 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as Vol.1 but Vol.2 adds an excellent storyline and drama too a great action film.
","Rated R for violence,language and brief drug use. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A(Should be 14A)Kill Bill Vol.2 is basically the second half of the Kill Bill movie series.Vol.1 was the first half of the series.A lot of people seem to like Kill Bill Vol.2 better than Vol.1.In my opinion Vol.1 is a classic.It was bloody,gory,artistic etc.Vol.2 is a departure from Vol.1.It is not as bloody as the first one however Vol.2 has a much better story,acting and drama.Vol.2 is a very good movie.The Bride has to now find Bill and the other people who put her in a coma and take revenge on them.Kill Bill Vol.2 is a more dramatic film with a better plot than the first film but I still like the first film better.Great movie.Runtime:136min9/10",8,0,1,12 August 2006
Scarface," One Of The Greatest Films Of The 80's.
","Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence and Language,Drug Use and Brief Nudity.I bought Scarface and Reservoir Dogs on DVD at HMV a couple of weeks ago.Scarface is a film that is very famous.A lot of people seem to know about it.At my high school a lot of people seem to wear Scarface T-shirts and other memoribilia.Scarface is big in the rap/hip-hop culture.Most people think that you have to be a rap music fan to like Scarface but that is definitely not true.I like rap but its not my favorite genre of music.Scarface is my third favorite film of all time.This film is simply excellent.I have seen it twice on DVD.This film is almost perfect.The acting especially that of Al Pacino is excellent.Pacino is Italian in reality but in this film he is a very convincing cuban drug dealer.The acting of Michelle Pheifer and Steven Bauer are very good as well.I'm really surprised this film was not nominated for any Oscars.I think its the best picture of 1983.Al Pacino was nominated for an acting Golden Globe but not for an academy award.Pacino is an excellent actor.We have seen him act well in plenty of films such as The Godfather Parts 1,2 and 3,Dog Day Afternoon,And Justice For All etc.Scarface is no exception.Pacino's acting is great!While tame by today's standards Scarface was considered really violent when it was released in 1983.It was slapped with an X-rating originally.Another reason Scarface is a great movie is because of the excellent storyline.The film is about a poor cuban immigrant named Tony Montana.As he finds criminal jobs like selling Cocaine and Murdering people he gets more money and becomes rich.However he becomes a cocaine addict and his kid-sister Gina who Tony did not want to turn out bad has become almost like he has.One of the best parts about the film is the big shootout in the end where *SPOILER* Tony Dies *END OF SPOILER*.In Conclusion if you have not seen the film Scarface yet I suggest going to your local video store and buying the film.You wont regret it.Runtime:170min 10/10",10,0,2,13 August 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious! Borat is one of the funniest films of all time
","Rated R for pervasive strong crude and sexual content including graphic nudity, and language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14A(should be 18A)I rented Borat after hearing about what a funny comedy it was.2006 was a great year for comedies.Borat and Clerks II are in my opinion among the funniest films of all time.This movie is hilarious! It is a bit offensive but it is very funny.The main character is hilarious and a bit racist to Jewish people(in real life Sacha Baron Cohen the guy that played Borat is Jewish).The film is about a man who lives in Kazakstan.He is a news reporter in Kazakstan who goes to America to learn about the culture and also to find Pamela Anderson who he hopes to marry.Filled with many funny misadventures.Borat is a very funny movie you wont want to miss.",9,24,39,11 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointment
","Rated PG for sci-fi action/violence.I have not seen Phantom Menace in years so I cannot tell you much about it story-wise.I don't even remember this movie that much.All I remember is that it was a disappointment after watching the classic episodes 4,5 and 6.There was so much hype for this film when it first came out but it ended up being a major disappointment.Not to say that its a totally bad film though.I remember there being some good fight scenes and Darth Maul was a pretty cool villain though he definitely does not compare to Darth Vader who is a much cooler villain with a more menacing voice.Attack Of The Clones was an improvement on this film and Revenge of the sith is the best of the prequels but none of these come close to being as good as the original Star Wars trilogy.",7,1,3,10 March 2008
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Monty Python goes biblical
","Life Of Brian is the second Monty Python film(well third if you count 'and now for something completely different', but that was not really a movie, just the best skits from the show, remade).Unlike Holy Grail, which took us to the medieval times, Life Of Brian brings us to the year 33 AD, during the time of Jesus and the Romans.Brian is a young man living with his mother in those times.He falls in love with a young Jewish revolutionary, joins her and her friends in trying to bring down the Romans.He gets caught by the Romans and tries to escape.One thing leads to another, and a group of people confuse Brian to be the messiah.Life Of Brian caused controversy when first released.People thought it was blasphemous, when it was actually just a satire on organized religion.It is nowhere near as blasphemous as say some of the jokes in 'South Park' or 'Family Guy'.This is also Monty Python's first R-rated film.The jokes are not any more raunchy(they save those for their later film 'The Meaning Of Life'), but there is male and female frontal nudity and the f-word is uttered a few times.It's probably one of the tamest R-rated films out there.Life Of Brian is just as good, if not a tad bit better than Holy Grail.It is a hilarious spoof of organized religion & false prophets and is definitely worth a watch.",9,0,2,7 February 2010
Akira," Pretty good anime
","Rated R for graphic violence and brief nudity.I usually enjoy anime films so I was interested in seeing Akira when it played on teletoon Friday night.It was a fairly long movie(clocked in at 2hrs 45min with commercials).It was a pretty interesting movie, anime buffs should like it but I thought it was a bit overrated. There is quite a bit of action, it has a good story and some good humor but the film is fairly weird and the dubbing isn't all that great(I hear its a new dub).Its about this motorcycle gang in which one of the members get picked up by some FBI agents and gets some sort of new power.He now becomes evil with power and its up to his friends to stop him.If you enjoy anime films then watch Akira, you might like it but I thought it was sort of overrated.",9,1,4,6 January 2008
Inglourious Basterds," While it did drag a bit, it 's a great World War II film
","Inglorious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's new film.It's basically Tarantino's take on World War II. Of course the film is historically inaccurate, but they were not going for historical accuracy when making this film.Quentin Tarantino is a great director giving us excellent films such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece and he has yet to top it.Inglorious Basterds was a great World War II film though.The best? I'm not sure, but it's definitely up there.I'm usually not a very big fan of Brad Pitt, but he was simply excellent in this film.He plays the redneck commander of a squad called the 'inglorious basterds', a team which specializes in killing nazi's.In my opinion, this is Pitt's best role! He is simply hilarious in an otherwise dark war film.Eli Roth and Sam Levine also play members of the 'basterds'.The plot of the film involves two groups of people who are trying to kill Hitler and the other nazi's.One group is 'the basterds', the others are two people who run a movie theatre.The woman who runs it had her family killed by the nazi's years earlier and wants revenge.There is a German officer who is smitten by her as well.The acting & characters are top-notch.It is very violent, which is expected for a Tarantino film, though there is not too much action.A problem I had with this film was that it dragged quite a bit.A lot of Tarantino films do this, but a lot of the time, it works.Some of it works here as well, I found that the opening scene was somewhat of a nod to the apartment scene in Pulp Fiction.We knew something bad was going to happen, however the two characters just converse as the suspense builds.They could have definitely shortened this film a bit. The rest of the movie is great and any Tarantino or World War II film fan should enjoy it.",9,3,14,22 August 2009
Rocky V," Worst one but still not bad
","Rated PG-13 for Violence and Language.Rocky 5 is the fourth sequel in the Rocky series and was thought to be the last one until Rocky Balboa.I think its good that Stallone made Rocky Balboa because that was a much better conclusion than this movie.This is the worst Rocky film in the series.But that does not mean it is bad.Sure some parts of the storyline are hard to believe but I thought the parts where Rocky tries to connect with his son were fairly good.Also the part where he reminisces while walking through Mickey's old gym was a good scene.This may be the worst Rocky but it is still an okay film.In this film, Rocky loses all his money and gets brain damage from his previous fight with Ivan Drago(from Rocky IV) so he cannot fight anymore and he is back in his old neighborhood.What's weird about this movie is that this takes place right after Rocky IV but in Rocky IV, his son was around 5 years old.In this one he is a teenager.Anyway now Rocky decides to train a younger fighter named Tommy Gunn.However there is this boxing promoter(modeled after Don King) who tries to steer Tommy away from Rocky by saying that Tommy is just living under Rocky's shadow.Also while Rocky trains this new man,he neglects his son who becomes a punk.In the end, Rocky and Tommy get into a street fight.Rocky V may be the worst Rocky in the series but it is still an alright movie.",7,6,7,1 July 2007
Stripes," Funny film about the army
","Rated R for sexuality/nudity, language and some drug use Stripes is a 1980's comedy starring Bill Murray and Harold Ramis.John Candy also has a role in the film.The film is a lot like 1984's police academy.I think this is better though.Both films are very alike.I saw this film a while ago so I don't remember the plot very well.This film is about two misfits who dislike their jobs and join the army. While they are trying to graduate however, many funny misadventures occur.Stripes is a fairly funny film and if you liked Police Academy, you will like this as well.A memorable scene in this film is where John Candy mud wrestles with these two women.A very funny scene.",8,0,0,3 September 2007
Hostel," Very gory but that's about it
","Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence/Gore,Nudity,Drug Use and Language. Quebec Rating:18+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A(should be R)Hostel is one of the goriest horror films of recent years.Recently, a lot of horror films have pushed the limits of violence in horror films.So I saw Hostel when it played on The Movie Network.Well I wasn't really expecting much so it didn't disappoint, but those who are expecting great storytelling, don't look here.Hostel basically relies on gore to entertain the audience and while the story is original, there is not much of it.If you watch this film just to see gore, you will not be disappointed however because it has a lot! Anyway Hostel is about three backpacking friends who are travelling in Europe.On their way, they visit a Hostel filled with beautiful women.So they have sex with some of the women but what they don't know is that they are part of this organization where they kidnap people such as tourists, then rich people come and pay money to torture them in horrific ways.Hostel is in my opinion a decent film filled with tons of gore.",8,2,2,26 July 2007
Public Enemies," Good film about real life mobster John Dillinger
","I saw Public Enemies today.I was interested in seeing it as I am a fan of mafia films.Not just ones set during the 1930's, but all of them.Michael Mann is also usually a good director as well.I knew little about John Dillinger so I do not know how historically accurate this film is.The performances were great.Johnny Depp played a good role as mobster John Dillinger and Christian Bale's acting was great as well.The plot involves the police trying to find and arrest John Dillinger, who escaped from jail and commits a series of bank robberies, while falling in love with this one girl.The movie is not boring, there is a good mix of action as well as plot.It's a bit long(2 hrs 20 min), but not as long as other gangster films such as 'The Godfather'.My only problem with the film was, at times the camera was shaky and made the film look a bit cheap.I don't know if Mann intended to do this.It wasn't a big deal for me, but some people may not like it.If you like crime/drama's, it's definitely worth watching.",8,3,4,4 July 2009
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," An excellent animated film based on an excellent animated TV series.
","Rated R for pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humor,and for some violent images.South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is the film version of the animated television series South Park.Now I must say that this review is biased.I am a huge fan of the show.South Park is my favorite television show so of course I will give the film an excellent review.If you are a fan of South Park you will love this movie.It is my #1 favorite movie of all time.I suggest every South Park fan see this movie.For people who are not a fan of South Park...you might enjoy this movie but not as much as if you were a fan of the show.There are plenty of laughs even if you are not a fan of the show but for non fans I suggest waiting for the TV version.The movie is pretty short but good.It is about the four south park boys Kyle,Stan,Kenny and Cartman who go sneak into the new Terrence and Philip movie.The film has plenty of profanity and fart jokes and pretty soon the boys start to imitate.This causes the parents of South Park to wage a war on Canada the country the film was made.So now its up to the boys to save Terrence and Philip and stop the war.There is a good message in the end of the film as well for strict parents who blame everybody for say violence in a film.South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is an excellent film and one of my favorites.Runtime:81min 10/10",10,2,2,12 August 2006
Oldboy," Much better than sympathy for mr vengeance
","Rated R for strong violence including scenes of torture, sexuality and pervasive language.After a year of pestering from a friend, I finally watched Oldboy.Oldboy is the second film in the Chan Woo Park Vengeance trilogy.The first film in the series is Sympathy For Mr Vengeance and the third film is Sympathy For Lady Vengeance.The films are all in one trilogy but have nothing to really do with each other, besides the fact that the films are all about revenge.I did not see lady vengeance but I didn't really care for mr vengeance that much.I found it to be a bit boring.It was an alright film though.Oldboy is much much better.The film is much more interesting, thought-provoking and entertaining than the first film.A man mysteriously gets locked up for 15 years.When he is released, he seeks vengeance on the man who locked him up.There are many plot twists in the film and you will find yourself on the edge of your seat when you watch it.Even if you didn't like Mr.Vengeance, Oldboy is worth a look!",9,6,10,28 January 2008
Spider-Man 2," One of the greatest superhero movies of all time
","Rated PG-13 for stylized action violence.Now I have not seen Spiderman 3 yet but I really want to.Spiderman is my favorite superhero.He is so cool and his movies are great as well.The first Spiderman film was pretty good but it could have been better.This film however is much better than the first and also one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.The action scenes are amazing because of the use of CGI and the storyline is great as well.The film is about Peter Parker, a nerd who has an alter ego as a superhero.He must fight Doc-Ock, a professor who turned evil after his mechanical arms took over while trying to save his relationship with Mary Jane, the woman he loves.Spiderman 2 is a great superhero movie and If you haven't seen it yet, you should.",9,24,32,24 August 2007
Superbad," Superbad is the funniest film of the year!
","Rated R for pervasive crude and sexual content, strong language, drinking, some drug use and a fantasy/comic violent image - all involving teens Im a teenage boy(15 years old) so I usually enjoy teenage sex comedies.I don't just like the new ones, the old ones are great as well and Fast Times At Ridgemont High is up there on my favorite teen comedy list.The trailers for this film were funny and I knew from the start I would enjoy it, I mean I really liked The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, but I thought it would be your average teen comedy.Was I wrong! Superbad is one of the funniest and greatest teen comedies of all time.There were times when my sides were hurting because I was laughing so hard, and that rarely happens.The film takes place in 1998.Evan and Seth are two lifelong friends who are about to be separated when they go to different colleges.Evan is calm and quiet while Seth is profane and obsessed with sex.The two never go to high school parties but they plan on it when they get invited to the last one before graduation by the girls that they are in love with.They get their friend Fogell who has a fake ID to buy them alcohol for the party,though his ID has a weird name on it(McLovin) he gets the booze but then the store he goes to gets robbed and these two cops come.Seth and Evan think Fogell got busted and go look for their own booze but end up at another party with some crazy people.Meanwhile Fogell and the cops go wild on a road trip.The whole movie shows the misadventures of the three and their attempt to get alcohol for the party.The trailer does not even come close to the hilarity of this film.If you like teen comedies, go watch Superbad now!",9,3,10,21 August 2007
Hot Fuzz," Overrated in my opinion but still pretty entertaining and funny
","Rated R for violent content including some graphic images, and language.I missed Shawn of the dead which seemed to be a big hit.I saw this film about a month ago after hearing great things about it.I found it a bit overrated.It was pretty funny at parts but it wasn't uproarious like people are saying.It was entertaining and a fun spoof of cop/buddy movies but it doesn't deserve to be in IMDb's Top 250 or anything like that.The film is about a tough cop who must move to a small town in england where the cops aren't as good.He cleans up crime on the streets but there are a series of bizarre murders that are going on.Its up to him and his partner who is a big fan of cop films to solve the case.The ending is pretty surprising and I will not spoil it here.If you like British comedies or cop films, you should check out Hot Fuzz but I found it to be a bit overrated.Still entertaining though.",8,1,2,7 March 2008
Juno," Excellent Teen Movie
","Out of all the best picture nominees for 2007, I liked Juno the most.It was smart, funny and entertaining and I enjoyed it.Did it deserve a best picture nom, I really cannot say, it's a good comedy(not the best) and the academy do not usually give best picture noms to comedies.The film is about a teenager who gets pregnant, wants to keep the baby and give it up for adoption and looks for a good family.She finds one but likes the husband a lot as they have the same interests in music and horror films.Juno is a funny, quirky comedy. I don't know if it deserved a best picture nom, but out of all the best picture noms for that year, I liked this the most.",9,12,26,7 March 2009
X-Men," Im not a big fan of X-Men but yes its a pretty good superhero film
","Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence.I think X-Men was the film that brought back the popularity of superhero films.Batman and Robin was a big disappointment and it seemed to stop people from making superhero films.When this came out, it was a box office hit and them the superhero trend of films started again.I have this film on VHS and I haven't seen it in a while.What I remember however is that it had great action scenes which is all you really need for a superhero film.I was never really a big fan of X-Men but I enjoyed this movie.If you are a fan of x-men or superhero films in general, I suggest checking this one out.",9,0,1,26 August 2007
Zodiac," Interesting film based on a true story
","Rated R for some strong killings, language, drug material and brief sexual images I watched Zodiac yesterday on the movie network.Zodiac is a crime/thriller based on the true story of the zodiac murders which went on in San Francisco in the 1970's.It tells the story of Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist who works at the San Francisco Chronicle who becomes obsessed with finding out who the real zodiac killer is.While he does so, his relationship with his wife and children start to fall and he becomes more paranoid.The film starts off in 1969 and it shows the investigation from 1969 to 1991.They still have not found the zodiac killer though they have a good idea who it is.The film really wraps you up in the story.The performances are great from the entire cast.If you like crime thrillers, I suggest watching Zodiac, its one of the best of the genre.My only problem with it was it got a bit boring at times.",9,1,2,31 December 2007
The Terminator," Great sci-fi/action film
","Rated R for Violence,Language and Some Sexuality The Terminator is Arnold Schwarggenager's most famous film.I don't think its anything special but back in 1984 the special effects were excellent.Now its just a fun action/sci-fi film.Terminator 2 Judgement Day is the best film of the series and Terminator 3 was pretty good as well.This is the worst one in the series but it is pretty entertaining as well.The plot involves a man sent from the future because a robot called 'The Terminator' was sent to kill Sarah Connor so she would never have her son who would aid them in a future war against the machines.The Terminator is filled with fun action scenes and is one of Arnold's best movies.",9,0,1,10 March 2008
Crash," Excellent movie! Deserved the best picture win!
","Rated R for language, sexual content and some violence.Crash was the best picture winner at the academy awards for the year 2005.A lot of people hated this decision.I saw both this film and Munich and Crash is far superior.Munich was not bad at all but Crash is an excellent film showing how racism affects all of us.The film has a great cast which includes Matt Damon,Larenz Tate,Terrence Howard,Sandra Bullock,Brendan Frasier and plenty of others.The film shows the lives of many different people living in Los Angelas and how their lives interwine.Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who one day traumatizes the wife of this calm film producer which causes him to snap.There are plenty of other stories in this film and they all end up interwining with each other.Crash is an excellent film which you should see.",10,0,5,16 September 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Worst of the original trilogy but still better than episodes 1 and 2
","Rated PG for sci-fi action violence.I haven't watched the Star Wars saga in years.I always thought that empire strikes back was the best of the series, followed by a new hope then revenge of the sith, then this, then attack of the clones and finally phantom menace which I remember thinking was a disappointment.I don't remember the storyline of this one that much but I remember it being entertaining and fairly good.A lot of people say this was not very good.I disagree, it was fairly good but of course not as good as the first two.This one basically marks the conclusion of the Star Wars saga which then in 1999 produced the first prequel film 'Phantom Menace'.I guess it was a good conclusion.",9,0,1,7 March 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Interesting
","Rated R for Graphic Violence and Language I saw Pan's Labyrinth yesterday on the movie network after hearing plenty of good things about it.From the plot, it sounded like a family film.I mean there's a young girl who is the protagonist and it seems sort of like Harry Potter.Then I was surprised to find that it was Rated R.There's no sex or nudity but there is plenty of graphic violence and blood.Also some profanity.THe film takes place in 1940's Spain.A young girl named Ofelia is with her pregnant mother visiting her stepfather.The stepfather is a cruel and sadistic Capitan who enjoys killing and torturing and doesn't like Ofelia that much.She befriends a kitchen worker who is really a spy.One day, Ofelia visits the labyrinth and a faun asks her to complete three tasks.Pan's Labyrinth has good special effects and it is an interesting fantasy film.Watch it if you like the genre.",9,2,5,28 October 2007
Knocked Up," Great romantic-comedy
","Rated R for Sexual Content,Language and Drug Use. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI just got back from seeing Knocked Up.I wanted to see this movie a while ago but I saw Live Free Or Die Hard instead.Its a good thing the movie was still playing at my local movie theater.I loved The 40 Year Old Virgin.I thought it was one of if not the funniest movie of 2005.There were only about six other people in the theater when I went to see it.Anyway on to the movie.Knocked Up is a fairly good romantic-comedy film.I think its a tad overrated but its probably one of the best romantic-comedies of the year.I preferred the 40 Year Old Virgin.Knocked Up is about a man named Ben Stone who is basically a party animal who smokes weed and hangs out with his friends.Meanwhile there's Allison who interviews celebrities.One day to celebrate Allison's promotion, her and her sister go to a club where she meets Ben.The two talk, get drunk and have sex.Eight weeks later however, Allison becomes pregnant.So now Ben must give up his partying lifestyle to try and be a good father.Knocked Up is a good film with some very funny parts.",9,0,2,18 July 2007
Shutter Island," A very entertaining thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time
","I saw Shutter Island yesterday.It was based on a book which I have not read, all I knew going into it was that it was directed by Martin Scorsese and was a thriller.After watching it, I can say that this is an excellent film.This film is a bit different from director Martin Scorsese's previous films, the majority of which involved the mafia and criminal activity(Mean Streets, Goodfellas, The Departed, etc).Shutter Island is a story about two field marshals who investigate the disappearance of a mental patient from the secluded 'shutter island', a place where the most dangerous mental patients reside.One of the field marshals(played by Leonardo Di Caprio) was a World War 2 veteran who experienced a few horrors as he was there.His wife was also killed in a fire a few years back.After some investigating, him and his partner feel that there is something wrong about the practises that go on at the island, and they set out to investigate that.Shutter Island is filled with various surprising twists and suspenseful scenes. The film definitely feels much shorter than 2hrs 20min.The acting is also top notch.If you are a fan of suspense, you owe it to yourself to go check out Shutter Island.",9,1,6,3 March 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Great first half...decent second half
","Rated R for strong violence and language and for sexual content.I have seen a total of four Stanley Kubrick films.They were The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Oddysea and this film.Clockwork Orange was an amazing film and one of my favorites.However I found the other three I saw to be overrated.The Shining was very good but it was not as good as everybody says it is.I just found 2001 boring.As for this film, it started out excellent but then turned mediocre.The first half of the film is very good.It is about a group of soldiers in Vietnam and their abusive(and sometimes hilarious) drill Sargent.There is a fat incompetent man who is nicknamed 'Gomer Pyle'.The drill Sargent enjoys yelling at and verbally abusing him.One day, Pyle causes everybody in the platoon to be punished.They then punish him.So now Pyle becomes more competent but much much crazier.He eventually kills the Sargent and commits suicide before graduation.This is the first half of the film and I found it to be very good.Now the second half of the film is a completely different story from the first.There is no mention of the events that happened in the first half and its just shows them in Vietnam.Its not bad but its a decent Vietnam film at best.Anyway Full metal Jacket started out great but became just a decent war film in the second half.Worth renting I guess if you like war films.",8,0,1,13 February 2008
Rocky II," Good sequel
",Rated PG for Violence and Some Language.Rocky II is the sequel to the highly successful 'Rocky'.I think this one is the third best in the series.Rocky 1 and 3 were better in my opinion but this film is still great.It has more humor than the first one but it still has the emotion that the first film had.The film takes place after the events of Rocky 1.Apollo Creed wants to fight Rocky again in a rematch so Rocky trains once more and tries to beat him.At first his wife Adrian does not want him to fight but after she falls into a coma.She wants Rocky to 'win'.This motivates Rocky even more.Rocky II was a good sequel to the first film.,8,2,2,30 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Phantom Menace
","Rated PG for sustained sequences of sci-fi action/violence.Star Wars Episode 2 Attack Of The Clones is the second film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy.I saw this a long time ago so I cant tell you anything plot-wise.Phantom Menace was a disappointment but this was a bit of an improvement over that film.It is more entertaining, there is more of a story etc.Also that annoying Jar Jar Binks is gone at least.Of course Revenge of the Sith is a much better film and none of the prequels come close to the original Star Wars trilogy which is definitely the greatest science fiction trilogy of all time.While the special effects are better in the prequels, the first three films had more story,heart and were overall more entertaining.",8,0,1,10 March 2008
The Godfather: Part II," One of the greatest sequels of all time
","Rated R for Violence and Language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AThere are few sequels which come close to being as good as the original.I thought Godfather 1 was the best movie in the trilogy but Godfather 2 comes very close in beating it.If you liked the first film, you will like the second one as well.There is more plot in this one but it is a bit more boring than the first.The flashbacks with a young Don Vito(played by Robert DeNiro) were interesting to watch and they were originally in the novel.There are two story lines in this movie.The first shows a young don Vito and his immigration to America and how he becomes a don.The second plot is about Michael(Al Pacino) running the mafia family in the 1950's.Godfather Part 2 is an excellent sequel which is almost as good as the first film.There is also a flashback scene at the end of the film which happens in the early 1940's.The family is waiting for Don Vito because it is his birthday while Sonny(James Caan returns in this film) argues with Michael about his decision to go to the army.",9,1,3,21 June 2007

","Rated R for strong sexuality, crude sexual dialogue, language and drinking, all involving teens.I saw this film about 6 years ago on TV when I was 9 years old.I then re-watched it yesterday having now been a teenager.My favorite teen film of all time is 'Superbad'.Its hilarious and realistic.Fast Times At Ridgemont High is the best teen film of the 1980's.I suppose this is the best teen film of the 90's but it wasn't all that great.I mean it was very funny and entertaining but nothing special.Its about four friends who try losing their virginity before prom night.I think this film brought back the teen sex comedy genre from the 1980's.Its a funny and good movie.It was better than the second American Pie which was still good.I have yet to see the third but I will soon enough.If you want to watch a very good 'teen sex comedy' watch 'The Last American Virgin'.",9,0,2,5 March 2008
Watchmen," Extremely underrated, very faithful adaptation and probably one of the greatest superhero movies of all time!
","I honestly cannot believe how underrated Watchmen is.It did not make a profit during it's theatrical release(though it did pretty good).It also seems to have a lot of haters on the IMDb forums.The reviews were mixed.I think it's one of those movies you will have to watch more than once.It has a fairly complicated storyline and I got lost at times when I saw it.However, overall I enjoyed the movie greatly.I picked up the original 1986 graphic novel and have since finished reading it.It was a bit better than the film, but just a bit! Director Zack Snyder made a very faithful adaptation to a comic deemed 'unfilmable'.Yes the ending has changed and there are some other things missing(though these might be included in the extended cuts of the film to be released on DVD).The 'Black Freighter' & newsstand scenes are gone(though I didn't much care for the black freighter parts), there are also a few other changes.The film is also more violent than the novel.The plot of the film starts off with a superhero named 'The Comedian' getting brutally beaten and thrown through a window.Then a masked vigilante named 'Rorshach' investigates his murder, while warning his old superhero friends.The rest of the film involves flashbacks of the superheroes, showing how the 1977 Keene act banned vigilantism forcing the heroes into retirement, as well as a romance between Nite-Owl and Silk Spectre(two other heroes).Watchmen is an unconventional superhero movie.Do not compare it to 'Dark Knight' or 'Spider-Man'.It's bloody, R-rated, thought provoking and not for young kids.This is another reason why people did not like it, they didn't know what to expect.Anyway, the film is a must for fans of the graphic novel.Others might probably enjoy the thought provoking superhero film.There is quite a bit of action as well!",9,5,12,20 May 2009
Grease," Not a big fan of musicals but this was fairly good
","Rated PG for Sexual Innuendos,Language and Teen Smoking/Drinking Grease is a musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton John.I must say, im not really a big fan of the musical genre but there are a few that I enjoy.This is one of them.The songs are pretty catchy and the movie has a fairly good plot.Its a teen film set in the 1950's like American Graffiti and Lemon Popsicle only this is not as serious as those movies.The film is about two teenagers who meet and fall in love over the summer but the girl says she has to move back to Austrailia ending their relationship.But their family seems to have a change of plans and she ends up going to the same school.The only thing is, she's a goody goody girl and the boy she fell in love with is a member of a gang.Graese is a fairly entertaining film and even if you don't like musicals, but like teen films then you should check this one out.",8,4,6,9 March 2008
American Psycho," Book was better but the movie is alright as well
","MPAA Rating:Rated R for Language,Sexual Content,Drug Use and Some Strong Violence. Quebec Rating:16+(should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating:18AI read the book American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis recently and loved it.It was a great book about a businessman who was a serial killer by night.While it did have some graphic scenes it was a very well written book which was sort of like a black comedy.Ever since I read the book I wanted to see the movie.I finally saw the movie today.The movie was pretty good but I expected more.The movie was a tad bit boring in my opinion.If you watch this movie, don't expect a slasher film.There are some violent bloody scenes in the film but most of the film shows the man's lifestyle and the lifestyles of his friends.They sometimes mistake each other for other people because they all basically do the same things.Most of the movie and the book as well shows people who are obsessed with materialism and outer-conformity.The main character Patrick Bateman is played by Christian Bale and Bale plays a very good role in the movie.I guess I was a tad bit disappointed with the movie because I thought there could have been more violence like in the book.Then again that's probably the mind of a teenager talking.American Psycho is still a pretty good film.",8,0,0,21 June 2007

The Shining," Pretty good but its overrated
","Rated R for Violence,Language and Nudity The Shining is based on the novel by Stephen King who is one of my favorite authors.The film is directed by Stanley Kubrick.I have only seen three Kubrick films.This one,2001 A Space Oddysea which I found very boring and Clockwork orange which I thought was excellent.The Shining is a pretty good horror movie with good performances.I have never read the book so I cant say if it is faithful to the book or not.The film is about a family who become caretakers of a hotel.However the hotel is haunted by the ghosts of the previous owners of the hotel.The son sees disturbing visions of the hotels past using 'The Shining' which is a telepathic gift.The father becomes crazy and tries to kill his wife and son.The Shining is an interesting horror movie but I just do not think it should be that high up in IMDb's Top 250.Worth watching for horror fans.",8,1,3,10 August 2007
BASEketball," Hilarious film starring Trey and Matt
","Rated R for strong language and crude sex-related humor.I am a very big fan of South park, so therefore I am also trying to see Trey and Matt's other films.I have seen Team America(which I liked but gets boring after seeing it so many times) and this one.This is not written by Trey and Matt, it is from the writers of the Naked Gun movies.However, the movie has plenty of South Park-style humor.The movie is basically about three losers who start a sport called baseketball.It is a mix of baseball and basketball and you must psyche-out your opponent(try to make them lose concentration).Some of these psyche-outs are simply hilarious!.One part has Trey Parker's character trying to psyche-out this really fat guy and he does his Cartman impersonation(Trey is the actual voice of Eric Cartman in the show South Park).The sport eventually becomes famous but the owner dies so the antagonist of the story now wants to buy the team and change the rules.THere is also a love interest and a little kid who looks up to Trey Parker's character.BASEketball is a hilarious film that I recommend to fans of South Park.",9,0,2,21 September 2008
Disturbia," Exceeded my expectations
","Rated PG-13 for sequences of terror and violence, and some sensuality.Disturbia is a teen thriller which is almost a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film 'Rear Window'.I never saw that film.I expected Disturbia to be an average teen-thriller film but it is actually fairly well done and entertaining.It definitely exceeded my expectations.The film is about a teen who survived a car crash which his father was killed in.After his Spanish teacher makes a comment about it, he punches him in the face and is put on house arrest.Being bored out of his mind he starts spying on his neighbors including the new girl who just moved in.She is the love interest in the film.One day, they see their neighbor murdering a woman and they try to stop him.Disturbia is a very entertaining film and is much better than most teen-thrillers.",9,1,2,16 March 2008
Rocky IV," Much different from Rocky 1 but still entertaining
","Rated PG for Violence.Rocky 1 was an Oscar-winning film with great acting,storyline,drama etc.Rocky 2 also had the drama and Rocky III had more action but still mixed drama into the storyline.Rocky IV came out and it was much different from the first film.This film is basically a revenge film which trades the original Bill Conti score for an all new heart-pumping 1980's soundtrack.I think the soundtrack in this film is better but that's probably because I like the type of music.The film's storyline and acting may not be that good especially in comparison to the first Rocky film but the movie is very fun and it should keep you entertained for the short 1hr and 30min run time.This film and Rambo First Blood Part II were both films that portray the Russians as villains.Back in 1985, when both films were released, the USA and Russia were enemies and that is what contributed to the box office.This film and Rambo 2 were big high grossing movies.In this one, a Russian boxer named Ivan Drago(Dolph Lundgren) challenges American boxer's to fight.Apollo Creed who has retired earlier, wants to fight him.During the match, he puts on a big show about America with James Brown singing.However, Ivan Drago who is very strong, kills Apollo in the ring.Drago does not seem very sorry that he killed him, so then Rocky Balboa decides to travel to Moscow, Russia to fight Drago.So he goes to Russia, trains in the show with heart-pumping 1980's music playing and then fights Drago in which is one of the best fight's in the series.Rocky IV may not have the good storyline of the first two films but it is a very fun and entertaining movie.",8,3,5,30 June 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The Greatest Comedy Of The 2000's.
","MPAA Rating:Rated R for pervasive sexual content,language and some drug use. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A(should be 14A)I have seen the unrated version of the 40 Year Old Virgin on the Movie Network twice.In my opinion The 40 Year Old Virgin is the greatest comedy film of the 2000's.The summer of 2005 brought back raunchy R-rated comedies like Wedding Crashers and this film.I have seen both and The 40 Year Old Virgin is miles ahead of Wedding Crahers.Wedding Crashers was really funny and good but 40 Year Old Virgin was funnier and had a more interesting storyline.Not that we look for acting in a comedy but Steve Carrell is really convincing as a nerdy 40 year old virgin.This film is about a geeky man named Andy.One day he plays poker with his co-workers and they gloat him for being a virgin after he accidentally talks about it.Their co-workers help him lose his virginity.He meets a single mother and he falls in love with her.Filled with dozens of funny scenes The 40 Year Old Virgin is an excellent comedy that you wont want to miss.Runtime:133min 10/10",9,2,4,13 August 2006

American History X," Excellent movie!
","American History X is a very powerful film about neo-nazism and racism in general.The acting is all around very good.I am used to seeing Ethan Suplee in comedy films, but this is his first dramatic role if I am not mistaken, he does a great job as well as Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Stacy Keach & Beverly D'Angelo.The movie is about an intelligent young man who'se father gets killed during a drive-by shooting while putting out a fire.The man then turns into a racist and under the influence of an older neo-nazi named Cameron, he becomes a neo-nazi gang leader.They shave their heads and wrack havoc on anyone who is not white.He goes to prison for killing three black people who were trying to steal his car.In prison, he works in the laundry room with a black man and starts to change his ways and befriend him.He comes out, completely reformed and no longer racist, however his younger brother is slowly becoming like he used to be, even writing a book report of the Adolf Hitler book 'Mein Kampf'.So now, the man must stop his brother from going down the wrong path he did.American History X is a very good film with very powerful performances.The ending is pretty surprising as well.I recommend it!",9,0,2,29 September 2008
Saw III," Not as good as the first two but still a good horror film(minor spoilers)
","Rated R for strong grisly violence and gore, sequences of terror and torture, nudity and language.I think of the Saw series as the greatest horror series of this generation.I think Saw 2 is the greatest horror film of all time.The films are very interesting and suspenseful and have a good amount of gore.Saw 1 and 2 were excellent but Saw 3 was not as great.I just didn't find it as interesting as the first two Saw films.However, Saw 3 is the goriest one in the series.I don't usually cringe during horror movies but watching the very long surgery scene on Jigsaw made me cringe.This film has a man going through obstacles to get revenge on the drunk driver who killed his son and the juror who acquitted him.Its his choice to save or kill the people.Meanwhile, his wife who is a doctor is kidnapped and is forced by Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda(who was the heroin addict who survived Jigsaw's trap in the first film) to save Jigsaw.Saw 3 is a good horror film, just not as good as the first two.",7,0,1,13 November 2007

Gone with the Wind," I actually enjoyed this
","Rated G(contains some language and violence, would probably be PG today) I usually find myself not liking older films.I haven't seen many of them but movies that are considered 'classics' that are fairly old, I find myself not enjoying.I watched Casablanca a few months ago and I found it boring and did not enjoy it.Rashomon, a Japanese film from 1950 was just mediocre in my opinion.This is an almost four hour long film from the late 1930's.I started watching it because I heard it was a 'classic' but I was prepared not to enjoy it.I found myself liking this film.Yes it is boring at times and it maybe a bit overrated but I actually thought it was a pretty good movie.It didn't even feel like a four hour long movie.The acting and storyline are great.There is some humor and is also pretty depressing.I can see why people would not like this film.Its very long and has plenty of dialogue.Im surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did.",8,2,4,4 March 2008

Kick-Ass," Kick-Ass!
","I got back from seeing Kick-Ass a few hours ago.I really wanted to see it as I'm a fan of superhero movies, especially darker R-rated ones.I loved Watchmen! Kick-Ass is both a superhero movie and a pretty funny comedy.Based on the graphic novel which I have not read, the story is about a nerdy teenager named Dave who decides to become a superhero named 'Kick-Ass'.The problem is that he is not very strong or skilled.Meanwhile, a father and daughter superhero team named 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl', who are much more experienced than Kick-Ass is, decide to meet up with him, and end up saving him from some violent drug dealers, which the drug dealer thinks kick-ass is responsible for.The father-daughter pair plan to kill a rich drug dealer because he framed Big Daddy for drug dealing years ago.Meanwhile Dave falls for this girl who thinks he is gay due to a rumor being spread at school and the drug dealer's son becomes a vigilante named 'Red Mist', just so he can bring the trio down.Kick-Ass works as a superhero/vigilante movie, but it also works as a teen movie.We see examples of Dave being a nerd as well as various pop culture references which would pertain to teens.This is probably the first R-rated superhero movie to feature teenagers.The character 'Hit-Girl' is probably the best character in the film due to her funny profanity-ladden one-liners and ability to really do damage to the baddies.The actress did a great job portraying her.Overall, if you like superhero movies or teen movies, then Kick-Ass is the movie to see!",9,3,13,30 April 2010
Slap Shot," One of my favourite sports comedies - a classic
","Hockey is my favourite sport to watch, pretty much the only sport i really watch and am into. I love reading and watching movies about it.Slap Shot is the classic hockey comedy. Directed by George Roy Hill and starring Paul Newman, the film follows a minor league hockey team known as the Charlestown Chiefs who after hearing they will be folded by the end of the season decide to play more violently/dirty in order to attract more popularity.The film has some very funny moments, great performances and is a must-watch if you're a fan of ice hockey or even a fan of sports films in general.This film, Goon and Puck Hogs are the only R-rated comedies about ice hockey I can think of.The sequel to this film is nowhere near as good and I haven't even bothered watching the third film as its Rated PG and seems to be more like mighty ducks, even though I do love the Hanson Brothers.9/10",9,2,2,20 August 2015

The Dark Knight," I think it was a bit overrated, but this is the best Batman film and the best superhero movie to date
","I saw this movie about three weeks after it came out.I stopped commenting on films on this site for a while, but now I have decided to start again.The Dark Knight is all over newspapers.It is the second highest grossing film of all time(it might even reach first) and is #3 on IMDb's Top 250 list(it even beat out The Godfather, something that has not happened in years).As I said, it's been a while since I have seen this film so I will tell you what I remember.The film does not mention Batman in the title and actually Batman isn't in the film all that much.The first part of the film is about a DA named Harvey Dent.He put away a bunch of criminals.There is a criminal mastermind called 'The Joker' on the loose.Any Batman fan knows that Joker is Batman's main enemy.There are plenty of plot twists and turns in the film that I will not spoil but basically Dent becomes two-face and it is up to Batman to stop him! There is also a bit of Scarecrow in this film.The acting in the film is excellent! Heath Ledger(who sadly passed away at the beginning of the year) plays the most brilliant joker out of any batman film.Yes, even better than Nicholson's 1989 portrayal.Heath is simply amazing in this film.He makes the joker seem so sadistic and evil! Anyway, if you are one of the few people who have not seen Dark Knight, go see it! It isn't just another kiddie superhero flick.It's actually more of a dark crime-drama! But I did find it to be a bit overrated.It should'nt really be #3 on the Top 250 in my opinion.",9,1,6,23 September 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," Amazing mafia movie, about as good as the godfather
","I had heard quite a bit about this film before I finally bought the DVD a few weeks ago.I had never seen it play on TV so I picked it up and watched it that very day.I must say, I was blown away.I knew it was going to be good, but the film was excellent.It is definitely in my Top 5 favorite gangster films.It's one of the few films I know which concentrates on Jewish gangsters as opposed to italians.Everything about this movie is great, from the score, to the acting, to the story.It's almost perfect.It's a bit hard to understand at times and you might need multiple viewings to get the complete experience.The film is in non-chronological order and jumps from three different time periods, the 1910's, the 1930's and the 1960's.We see the characters as kids, how they meet and how they start their own criminal activities while worrying about another gangster.They then jump to the 1930's, where they are adult gangsters, robbing banks and dealing in alcohol during prohibition, and finally the 1960's where the leader returns to the old place after 35 years.The cast of the film involves Robert De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, William Forsythe and Jennifer Connelly.The acting is excellent from everybody involved.It's quite bloody and violent for a 1980's film.It's also a good thing the original version has been released here.Apparently, for the U.S theatrical release, the film company cut almost 90min of footage and re-edited the film in chronological order.This caused the film to be a mess, it got horrible reviews from critics and did not make much money at the box office.The original version is widely praised and is an excellent film.If only they had released that version in the first place.The cut version is very rare nowadays.I personally think this is one of the best mafia films of all time and if you are a fan of 'The Godfather', you will probably love this film.",10,4,10,5 July 2009
Taken," Fairly good action/thriller
","I saw Taken a few days ago.I heard it was good.While it is not as good as everyone says it is, it's still a fairly good action/thriller in the vein of Steven Seagal's films.There are a few similarities between this movie and Seagal's films(at least his older ones).The acting, especially from Liam Neeson is great.The plot involves a father who's daughter & friend have been kidnapped in Paris and forced into drugs/prostitution.The father is also an ex-CIA operative.He goes to Paris and basically looks for his daughter while battling corruption and just fighting and killing people.Taken may be a tad overrated, but it is a good action/thriller.",9,2,4,6 March 2009
Avatar," Very overrated, but still a good movie
","Avatar, the newest James Cameron epic.Avatar is officially the highest grossing film of all time(not counting the inflation of older films of course), beating Cameron's previous film 'Titanic' which held the record for a good 12 years.Also keep in mind, the film was released in 3D and therefore the ticket prices for the 3D are higher than the price of an average ticket.Now visually, this film is amazing.The special effects are great and the film is nice to look at.The acting is good as well.The story on the other hand, has been done before.The film is about a young paraplegic marine named Jake Sully who takes part in a program where he is placed in the body of an alien and meant to stay in the alien tribe to learn how they live.At first, the others don't like him all that much, but they grow to like him and he grows to like them.However, the army is planning an attack on them.So now, Jake and the other aliens must fend them off.Avatar is a pretty good film, it's just not as breathtaking as everybody says it is.Worth a watch though I personally found it overrated.",8,2,5,1 February 2010

","Rated R for Strong Violence/Gore,Language,Sexual Content,Some Nudity and Drug Use Grindhouse is Quentin Tarintino's and Robert Rodriguez's two films that played back to back theatrically to bring back the memories of the old Grindhouse movie theaters of the 1970's where two low budget features would play back to back for the price of one film.There were also trailers between each film.This was a flop at the box office and the two films entitled Planet Terror and Death Proof were released on DVD separately without the fake trailers.But the movie network played Grindhouse in its entirety yesterday.Both films along with the fake trailers for a total runtime of 3 hours and 10min.The film started with the fake trailer for a film called 'Machette'.The first film was Rodriguez's Planet Terror.I would say that Planet Terror is one of the greatest zombie films of all time.It is very gory,interesting and humorous.The film is about a man who releases this special gas which turns people into zombies.So now the remaining survivors must battle the zombies and stay alive.Basically the same plot as any other zombie film only this one is much more entertaining than the others.I would give Planet Terror a 10/10.Now there are a few fake trailers that play after Planet Terror ends.They are 'Werewolf Women Of The SS' and 'Thanksgiving'.I cant remember what the other trailers were(if there were any others).The fake trailers are very funny and interesting.The second film is Quentin Tarintino's Death Proof.Now I did not like this one all that much.I usually love Tarintino films such as Pulp Fiction,Kill Bill,Reservoir Dogs.I have seen them all except for Jackie Brown.Death Proof wasn't all that bad, it was just fairly boring.Most of the film just shows women talking about random things while a mysterious man named Stuntman Mike and his 'Death Proof' car try to kill them.Most of the film is fairly dialogue ridden, which I don't usually mind.I mean I enjoy dialogue-ridden films such as Zodiac,The Godfather,Gone With The Wind.But Death Proof was for the most part boring.There were some funny parts but the real highlight of the film is the ending.The ending is basically some four girls plotting revenge on stuntman mike and the scene where they get revenge on him is very interesting and entertaining.Overall Death Proof was mediocre but the ending was excellent.Overall, if you haven't seen Grindhouse, I suggest checking it out.",9,0,0,8 March 2008
Life Is Beautiful," Pretty good film
","Rated PG-13 for holocaust-related thematic elements Life Is Beautiful is one of those films which are like two different films combined together.The first half of the movie is a silly slapstick romantic-comedy about a man trying to woo a girl with his humor.The second half of the film is a holocaust drama about a man who does not want his son to know about the horrors of the concentration camp so he pretends that it is all a game and the first prize is a real life tank.The film is a bit overrated in my book, I mean the film is not really funny but its the holocaust part of the film that makes it really worth seeing.I suggest renting the film but do not expect to much in the comedy department.",9,1,3,19 November 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Pretty Good Film.
","MPAA:Rated R for Strong Sexual Content,Violence Including Rape and Language. Quebec Rating:16+ Canadian Home Video Rating:R(should be 18A)I got A Clockwork Orange on DVD about a month ago.Clockwork Orange is the second Stantley Kubrick film I have seen.The other one I saw is the shining which was overrated but fairly good as well.Clockwork Orange was a very controversial film when first released because of its graphic sexual content and violence.It was originally rated X but re-rated R after some edits were made.All the DVD versions are the original X-rated version.This film has plenty of nudity even for today's standards.Clockwork Orange is a fairly good film.The acting of the entire cast is very good.Malcom McDowell is the only known member of the cast.The film is about a gang led by a teenager named Alexander Delarge who is by day a student and by night a rapist.Him and his gang,rape and beat up plenty of people.After Alex mistreats his gang they decide to betray him.One day when Alex tries to rape this girl obsessed with cats he accidentally kills her.His gang knocks him out and he is arrested.He stays in jail for about two years but becomes an experiment for this new technique called the Ludovico technique.He must view disturbing film clips related to rape and violence.After some more of this he is cured and he leaves prison.But he finds himself helpless to defend himself from his past.In the beginning of the film you wouldn't feel sorry for Alex because he seemed like a mean rapist and killer.But in the end of the movie you do feel sorry for him somehow.I read the novel a bit before I saw the film.Its pretty faithful to the book except for forgetting the 21st chapter and other small things.A Clockwork Orange is a great film that you should buy.Runtime:136min 10/10",9,0,1,13 August 2006
Reservoir Dogs," A Tad Bit Overrated But A Great Debut Film.
","Rated R for Strong Violence and Language.I got Reservoir Dogs and Scarface on DVD a couple of weeks ago at HMV.Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarintino's debut film.Tarintino has made many excellent movies such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Reservoir Dogs is an excellent beginning film.Its a tad bit overrated(#61 in the Top 250 films of all time, come on)but Reservoir Dogs is a fairly good film with great acting and a clever storyline that will leave you thinking.The film is about a couple of people who plan on robbing a bank.They each have color codenames such as Mr.Blonde,Mr.Blue,Mr.Brown,Mr.Pink etc.However the cops came just a bit after they did screwing up their plan.One of the criminals tipped off the cops and they try to think which one it was.The film shows present time and flashbacks.The flashbacks show how each person took the job and the present shows how them trying to figure out who tipped off the cops while in the warehouse.Reservoir Dogs,while not as violent as Kill Bill Vol.1 is a pretty violent and bloody film.With a great 70's soundtrack,some memorable quotes and scenes Reservoir Dogs is a good rental film but it is a tad bit overrated.I don't usually agree with critic Roger Ebert but he said that Tarintino could do much better.I think so too and Tarintino proved it when he made Pulp Fiction the best film in his filmography.Runtime:100min 9/10",9,1,3,13 August 2006
Rocky," Stallone's best movie and the best Rocky in the series
","Rated PG for Violence and Some Language.Rocky is a great movie.It was Sylvester Stallone's first 'big' movie and also his best.It won best picture of 1976 and Stallone was nominated for Best Actor.The film spawned 5 sequels.The most recent was Rocky Balboa which was released last year.Rocky 3 and 4 were more like action films unlike the other Rockies which were drama.This film has everything,A good storyline,Stallone's best acting job,romance etc.The film is about a poor amateur boxer named Rocky Balboa who one day gets the chance to 'go the distance' with the champion 'Apollo Creed'.So the movie shows 'Rocky' getting ready for the fight while falling in love with his friend's sister Adrian and facing other problems.Some might find the first Rocky film boring but I think it is the best film in the series! A great movie.",8,1,1,30 June 2007
Pulp Fiction," Tarintino's Best!
","Rated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality.I have seen all the Quentin Tarintino films except for Jackie Brown.I own Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill Vol.2 on DVD.I first started liking Tarintino when I saw Kill Bill Vol.1.I then saw Vol.2 and then Reservoir Dogs.Now Pulp Fiction.Everybody has been saying that Pulp Fiction is Tarintino's best film.They are not wrong.Pulp Fiction is in fact Tarintino's best.This is now one of my favorite movies.Everything about this film is great! The acting is superb.The film has an all star cast which consists of Tim Roth,Harvey Keitel,John Travolta,Samuel L Jackson,Uma Thurman,Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames.The acting in the film is definitely superb.Then there is the plot.The plot is very interesting.It basically shows the lives of two hit men,a boxer,a mob boss and a bunch of other characters and how their lives inter-wind with each other.There are plenty of stories in the film relating to the different characters.The stories are not in order however.Pulp Fiction is an excellent film and I recommend buying it!.It definitely deserves its spot in the Top 250!

Detroit Rock City," Better than I expected!
","Detroit Rock City is a teen film set in the 1970's.There have been quite a few like this(such as the brilliant 'Dazed & Confused').This film was not as good as Dazed, but it definitely exceeded my expectations.I somewhat like the band KISS(who are the basis of this movie), I like some of there songs, but I am not a big fan like plenty of other people.You do not need to like KISS to enjoy this movie.It's very funny and also has a good story.The film is about four friends who plan on going to a KISS concert.However one of them has a very strict Christian mother who will not let him see them.So she destroys all their tickets.They now have to go and find another way to get tickets and get into the concert, while getting into a bunch of funny misadventures.Detroit ROck City is a funny and great film, you do not need to like KISS to see it.",9,0,0,25 February 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Underrated and Good Film.
","Rated PG-13 for disturbing images,violence,some nudity,thematic material,brief drug references and sexual content. Quebec Rating:13+(should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI have never read the book The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown which has been #1 on the bestsellers list for a long time so my review might be generous.As I left the theater when I saw it I heard a couple of people say that the movie missed a lot of parts from the book.For people who did not read the book this movie will be really good.Its a good thinking movie with an excellent plot,great acting from Tom Hanks and everyone else in the cast.However be warned that the subject matter might offend some people.They say in the movie that *spoilers* Jesus married Mary Magdalene,they had children and Mary was not a prostitute *end of spoiler*.This subject matter probably will offend the really strict Christian fanatics.Thats why the film has caused some controversy.This film has many surprising twists in it as well.Now for the plot.Robert Langdon is a professor who gets picked up by some policemen and asked to look at some engravings in a mans body.Then him and the granddaughter of the murdered man escape from police because she tells Robert that he is in great danger.The two escape police and look for a friend of Roberts who owns a castle.This man knows many things about Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings and codes.He explains the painting of Jesus's the last supper.Also there is an albino man who is part of a group called Opus Dei claiming to be an angel and kills sinners.He tries to murder Robert Langdon and his friends.They all then try to figure out the code which opens the holy grail.The Da Vinci code is a great movie with surprising twists,great acting and a great plot.I recommend seeing the film in theaters.However as I said before I heard the movie isn't as accurate as the book and the subject matter might offend some people.Runtime:150min9/10",9,1,3,12 August 2006
Rocky III," Almost the best one in the series
","Rated PG for Violence.For me, Rocky 1 is the best film in the Rocky series.However Rocky III comes very very close.This one takes a change in the genre.The first two Rockies were Drama's.This film is more of an action but there is also drama as well.The film may not have the great storyline the first two films did but it is very entertaining and is a fun boxing movie.Also the film features Mr.T and Hulk Hogan.Both films basically made their careers.Mr.T provides the humor of this film! He is hilarious.This film now has Rocky being a rich and successful boxer.He one day gets challenged to a match by this amateur boxer named Clubber Lang(Mr.T).They fight and Clubber beats him.So then Rocky's old enemy Apollo Creed befriends him and trains him to beat Clubber Lang.Rocky III is almost the best film of the Rocky series and it just ranks slightly lower than Rocky 1 in my opinion.Still an excellent movie.",8,2,3,30 June 2007
The Godfather: Part III," Definitely not as good as Godfather 1 and 2 but still a great mafia film and a great conclusion
","Rated R for Violence and Language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AThe Godfather and The Godfather Part II are the two greatest mafia epics ever! Both had great acting, a great storyline, great characters, an all star cast and were just overall great movies.Sixteen years after Godfather 2, Godfather 3 was released.This one was not as well received as the first two but was still nominated for Best Picture of 1990 academy awards.However Goodfellas came out that same year and it was much much better than Godfather 3.Both films lost to Dances With Wolves.I have not seen that film.Godfather III isn't as good as the first two because it is not as interesting and the acting of Sofia Coppola is not very good.However Al Pacino as usual steals the show.He is in fact an excellent actor.Most of the cast of the first two godfather films are in this such as Al Pacino,Diane Keaton,Talia Shire etc.However there are some new actors in the third film such as Andy Garcia and Bridget Fonda.Also the first two films took place in the 40's and 50's(well half of Godfather 2 took place in the 10's and 20's).This film takes place in 1979-1980.Michael Corleone is now older and is still running his mafia family.His son does not want to work for him so he takes Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent under his wing.While Godfather 3 wasn't as good as the first two, it had an excellent ending! The ending was simply amazing and I will not spoil it here.Godfather III is a very underrated and great mafia film though it is not as good as the first two.",9,1,4,1 July 2007
Zombieland," Good Zombie Horror/Comedy
","I watched Zombieland yesterday and I must say it is a good horror/comedy zombie flick.I do find it a bit overrated though.It has some hilarious moments, especially from Woody Harrelson's character and a fair amount of zombie gore and action.I don't personally think it should be in the IMDb's Top 250 though.The film is basically about the world being overrun by zombies and four survivors who band together to get to an amusement park which is apparently 'zombie free'.Along the way they kill zombies and get into other misadventures.The acting in the film is fairly good but mostly it has what you would expect from a horror/comedy. Laughs and gore! If you like zombie films, comedies or even comedies about zombies such as 'Shaun Of The Dead', you will like this.",8,0,1,1 November 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Pretty entertaining

The movie is just great. It's 2.5 hours long and never gets boring, the acting is great and has a cast of Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Anthony Anderson among others.The film is based on the 2002 Asian film 'Internal Affairs', which I have not seen.The film is about two people.One is a police officer(Di Caprio) who goes undercover as a henchmen for Costello's(Jack Nicholson) crime family, while a friend of Costello's(Matt Damon) joins the police force.The film shows how their lives are affected and you definitely will not expect the ending.Overall an excellent film which I recommend.",9,1,3,7 March 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Great action flick
","Rated R for strong violence and pervasive strong language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18AI saw Live Free Or Die Hard about a month ago and thought it was a great action movie.I wanted to see the other three Die Hard films which I did not see before watching Live Free or Die Hard.So when Die Hard with a Vengeance was playing on TV, I saw it.I think this is better than Live Free Or Die Hard but probably only because Samuel L Jackson is in the film and he is one of my favorite actors.In this film,the brother of the man John McClane killed in the first Die Hard wants revenge, so basically he makes John do all these things for his amusement, he then says he hid a bomb inside one of the many schools in the city so all the cops are out looking for the bomb while him and his sidekicks steal gold.Die Hard With A Vengeance is a very fun action film with great action scenes.I have yet to see Die Hard 1 and 2.",9,1,2,30 July 2007

","Rated PG-13 for some disturbing images, sexuality, brief language and nudity.I just saw Stranger than fiction on the movie network.I enjoy Will Ferrel's previous films.Despite what IMDb says at the moment, Stranger than Fiction is a comedy.Its not a hilarious comedy like say other Will Ferell films such as Old School or Anchorman but it does have its funny moments.The plot I will have to admit was interesting and original.The film is about a man who hears a narrator who is speaking about his life.The narrator is a writer who is writing a book but little does she know, her book is happening in real life.The writer/narrator also plans on killing off the main character.So the man basically tries to live his life while meeting a psychiatrist while the writer thinks of a good way to kill off the main character.Stranger Than Fiction has its funny moments and it has an interesting storyline but it was fairly strange and not really my cup of tea.",8,1,2,31 August 2007
The Green Mile," Amazing prison movie(contains some spoilers)
","Rated R for violence, language and some sex-related material. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI have heard that the green mile was up there as one of the greatest prison movies.That and Shawshank redemption which I have not seen.I saw part of the film on TV and loved it.I wanted to watch the rest of the film so I rented it and watched it.I must say the green mile is a fantastic prison movie.It is based on the novel by Stephen King who is one of my favorite authors.I will read the novel very soon.The Green Mile has pretty much anything you would want in a prison film.Its a very powerful drama with a few funny scenes.The film starts off with an old Paul Edgecombe in a retirement home.After watching the film 'Top Hat' he tells his friend about how he used to be a prison guard in the year 1935.The film is called 'The Green Mile' because the floor is green.This prison floor has the prisoners who are to be sentenced to death by electric chair.One of the prisoners is John Coffey, a gentile giant who is afraid of the dark.He is convicted of raping and murdering two little girls.The beginning of the film does not show much of John as it does the life in the prison.It shows the prison guards and some of the prisoners on death row.There is also a mouse named Mr.Jingles who befriends a prisoner named Delacroix.We also see a new crazy prisoner named 'Wild Bill' who messes around with the guards.He is the comic relief of the film.Later in the film we see John's gift of healing.He first heals Paul's urinary infection.There is a sadistic guard named Percy who'se aunt is the wife of the governor of the state.This enables him to pretty much do what he wants.He is very mean spirited as he sabotages Delacroix's execution and makes him suffer greatly.But before he does that he also kills Mr.Jingles.John, however brings him back to life.After the guards know about John's healing powers, they decide to take him out of jail to visit this woman who is dying of cancer.When he sees the guards take John out, Wild Bill grabs him.While he does this,John sees that he is in fact the killer of the two little girls, the crime for which he was convicted for.After John heals the woman and they go back to the prison, John infects Percy with the disease that he took out of the woman.This makes Percy shoot and kill 'Wild Bill'.After, the disease comes out of Percy but this makes him crazy and he gets sent to the mental institution, ironically it is the place where he was offered a job.When Paul wonders why John would do this, John takes his hand and shows Paul how 'Wild Bill' killed the two girls.This proves his innocence however John wants to die because he does not want to live in a world with all the bad things that go on in it.John ends up getting killed in the electric chair while the guards are all crying.The film then goes back to the present where we find out Paul is 108 years old and him and Mr.Jingles are still alive.However Paul thinks that god is punishing him for not stopping John's execution by making him outlive his friends and family.The Green Mile is an amazing prison film with excellent performances.This film simply has Michael Clarke Duncan's best performance.The acting is all around great.The Green Mile is one of the greatest prison movies of all time and one of the greatest film of 1999.",9,1,4,13 August 2007

The Shawshank Redemption," A good movie? Definitely...Deserving of the #1 spot of IMDb's Top 250? No
","The Shawshank Redemption is an academy-award nominated 1994 film starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.It was based on a short novella by Stephen King entitled 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', which was featured in the collection entitled 'Different Seasons'.This novella collection also includes the novellas which were later made into the movies 'Apt Pupil' and 'Stand By Me'.Stephen King is actually my favorite author and I really enjoyed the novella.Now for the movie.I watched it a few months ago and I found that it was very good.The acting is superb, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great, the storyline, characters etc were all great.It is a great movie.However it definitely does not deserve to be #1 on IMDb's Top 250 movie list or any top movie list for that matter.I liked the novella a bit more though there were some changes in the film that I liked better.The film is directed by Frank Darabont who would later make the amazing and superior(in my opinion) 'The Green Mile'.Overall, Shawshank is definitely one of the best prison movies of all time, though it is a tad overrated.",9,0,2,14 March 2009
Platoon," Great movie about the Vietnam war
","Rated R for Graphic War Violence,Language and Drug Use.After hearing a lot about it, I watched the film 'Platoon' yesterday on MoviePix.I usually enjoy war films yet there are plenty of war films considered classics that I have not seen such as Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter.I personally think the film 'Three Kings' is the greatest war film of all time.This is either the second or third best war film ever(Saving Private Ryan was great as well so Im not sure if this would be second or third).The film has a great cast which consists of Charlie Sheen,Tom Beregner,Wilem Dafoe,Forest Whitaker,Keith David,Kevin Dillon and the doctor from the TV series Scrubs.Charlie Sheen is the main character and is said to be a rich kid who dropped out of college to volunteer to fight in the war.While he's there, he meets plenty of people who introduce him to marijuana.The film basically shows the Vietnam war and how it was like.From what I heard, its a realistic account.Anyway, if you like war films, check out Platoon, you wont be disappointed.",9,1,2,3 November 2007
Scream," One of the best horror movies of all time! Wes Craven is a genius!
","Scream was released in 1996. This was when horror films were losing popularity.Wes Craven, director of classics such as Nightmare On Elm Street 1 and New Nightmare, decided to make a semi-spoof horror film.Do not think of it as 'Scary Movie'(which was a spoof of this and other horrors), because it is not much of a stupid comedy.It's an actual horror film, but also an intelligent spoof of crappy horror films of the 1980's.The characters are self-aware of this and make fun of them.In one scene, a character lists what not to do during a horror film.Another character talks about the nightmare on elm street series, saying the first one was good but the rest sucked! These comedic elements are interesting in contrast to the rest of the film which is a decent slasher flick.The main plot is about a teen girl who'se mother was raped and murdered about a year ago.The case re-opens as another killer is on the loose.People are trying to find out who it was.The ending is definitely shocking, you will not expect it! The film was meant to kill off the horror genre, but instead made it popular again.Films such as 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' were released, this one even spawned two sequels.Overall, I think it's one of the best horror movies of all time and you owe it to yourself to check it out.",9,1,2,23 May 2009
Never Back Down," Once you get passed the un-realistic ness of the film, it's actually pretty good
","When I saw the trailer for 'Never Back Down', I didn't seem too impressed.It looked like a lamer version of 'The Karate Kid' and I was not interested in it one bit.I watched it on the movie network on Friday.It actually exceeded my expectations! Once you get passed the un-realistic ness of the movie, and the fact it is sort of like a UFC version of 'Karate Kid', there is a fairly decent film.It's about a teen who's father was killed right in front of him in a drunk driving accident.During a football game, someone on the other team mentions this, which starts a fight.This is right before the family moves to a new place and he attends a new school.However the fight made it to youtube and everybody has seen it.He gets invited to this party by this pretty girl and everything seems to be going fine.However, this one person who enjoys fighting, wants to challenge him.He does and the other guy brutally beats him.Here is an unrealistic aspect, no high school party has girls making out while naked in a hot tub(as depicted in the film), and how many teens have planned fights at their parties? Anyway, he decides to train at a UFC-style gym so he can beat this guy.The rules of the gym are if you fight outside, you are out.So he starts training and forms a small friendship with the owner.However, one day his temper gets the better of him and he gets into a fight with four guys in a hummer.He gets kicked out of the gym but begs to come back, he lets him and decides against fighting him again.He also forms a relationship with the girl who invited him to the party.He also learns more about the owner of the gym.This movie is much like the Karate kid(almost a remake), it may be unrealistic but it actually is better than the trailer shows it.The acting is fairly good(despite having a cast of mostly nobodies). Overall a fairly decent film.",8,1,2,15 February 2009
Straight Outta Compton," The Greatest Biographical Film of a Rap/Hip-Hop Artist or Group
","I credit NWA with introducing me to hip-hop back in seventh grade.Prior to this, I wasn't a huge fan of the genre (except for maybe some Eminem) mainly because I only heard the rap/hip-hop music played on the radio or music video shows, which by the 2000's seemed to decline in quality.I then saw the music video for the song 'Straight Outta Compton' on TV one day and immediately I got into NWA which started me on a path to discover classic rap and hip-hop.So of course when I heard that there would be a biopic of N.W.A, I had to see it.Overall, I was very impressed with the film. The runtime is 2hrs 27min but it felt much shorter than that. The film does a good job of detailing the beginnings of NWA, how a group of young men from Compton, Ice Cube, MC REN, Eazy-E, DJ Yella and Dr.Dre wanted to make music that would make people aware of the dangers of living in Compton and other ghettos, despite the fact that due to the use of gratuitous foul language and depictions of sex, drugs and violence in their music were thought to glamorize the 'gangsta' lifestyle.The film shows the controversy which surrounded the group, the police brutality they and many people living in Compton faced on a day to day basis as well as personal issues regarding whether or not their manager Jerry Heller along with Eazy-E were skimming money from the rest of the group which eventually led to Ice Cube and later Dr. Dre's departure. The film also depicts the gangsta rap scene of the late 80's-mid 90's and other issues such as the L.A Riots.The performances in the film from a cast of mostly unknown actors are also very good.The only issues I had with the film are that I would have liked to see at least some of the Eazy-E/Dr.Dre feud as well as more of MC Ren, who even took to twitter to complain about his reduced portrayal in the film.If you are a fan of NWA or rap/hip-hop in general, then you owe it to yourself to see this film. Even if you are not a fan of this genre of music but enjoy music biopics in general, you would likely still enjoy this film.9/10",9,6,37,20 August 2015
Trainspotting," Great comedy/drama about drug addiction
","Rated R for Strong Language,Graphic Drug Use,Sexual Content and Disturbing Images.Trainspotting is a British film about heroin addiction.Most drug comedies are about Marijuana but this one is about heroin.Its not entirely a comedy though.There are some very funny parts but it has a good mixture of Comedy and Drama.The film is about a heroin addict named Renton who tries to quit his heroin addiction but it is hard for him because of all his friends who do drugs.There are plenty of misadventures that go on in the movie.Trainspotting is a great anti-drug comedy and I recommend it.I like the movie much better than the book.For me the book was too hard to understand.9/10",9,2,3,13 June 2007

Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI just saw Live Free Or Die Hard in theaters.I did not see the first three Die Hard movies but now I want to after watching this.This may not be the greatest action film of all time but it is a great and very entertaining action flick.Bruce Willis is pretty cool as John McClane and the film has a cameo by Kevin Smith(Silent Bob from the Jersey series.He is also the director of these films).The film is about a cop named John McClane.He must retrieve a computer hacker and bring him to the FBI.However there are men out to kill him while this same group of people are trying to basically destroy America.So John McClane with the help of this computer hacker, must stop these guys.The film has some very cool action scenes and is worth watching for action film fans.",9,0,1,30 June 2007
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Awesome horror film!
","Rated R for Strong Violence/Gore,Language and Some Sexual Content.I have seen Nightmare On Elm Street 1 and 2.I thought 2 was actually decent but the first one is much better.I didn't see the other films in the series but I want to now that I saw this! This is a great horror film, its among the best horror films of all time in my opinion.I have seen parts of the sequels of the films and while I like the comedy of the sequels, the first is great as a dark,disturbing horror film! The film is about a child-murderer who was burned alive by parents.Then years later, he comes back in the form of a burnt man in the dreams of teenagers and murders them.So now the teens must find a way to stop him or they will be next! Nightmare On Elm Street is a great horror film!.",9,0,1,23 July 2007
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Pretty funny
","Rated PG for Some Language I saw Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure yesterday night on the channel Moviepix.It stars Keanu Reeves before he became an action star and was in films such as 'The Matrix'.George Carlin and Diane Franklin provide supporting roles.The film has a few funny moments and is overall a pretty interesting film.The film is about two aspiring rock star teens living in California.They must get an A+ on their upcoming history report or else they will fail history class and Ted's dad will send him to military school.If they do get separated, the future will be ruined so a mysterious man comes back from the future to help them with their history report.Using this magical telephone booth, they o to various places in time to get historical figures to help them with their report.Hilarity ensues.Bill and Ted is an interesting film worth watching if you find it on TV.The sequel plays tonight and I might check it out.",8,1,2,3 January 2008
The Matrix," Very interesting and entertaining action/sci-fi film
","Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief language Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI got the Matrix when it first came out on VHS.This was when I was in the first or second grade.When I saw it back then, it blew my mind.It still blows my mind.This is the best Matrix film in the trilogy.Matrix Reloaded was almost as good as this one but I find that I can watch this one over and over again which I cant with the second film.The third film Matrix Revolutions was a major disappointment.I have only seen it once but it was a very disappointing end for the trilogy.It was still mediocre.I have not seen this film in a while so I do not remember the storyline very well.But what I can tell you is that 'The Matrix' is a film with an interesting plot and is filled with tons of cool action and sci-fi sequences.Sci-Fi and action fans will love this movie!",9,0,1,9 August 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the greatest sci-fi films ever made!
","Rated PG for Violence The Star Wars saga is one of(if not the most) popular saga out there.The first film came out in 1977 and ever since then there have been plenty of fans who go as far as dressing up and waiting in line for days when the sequels come out.In my opinion I think the original Star Wars trilogy(Episodes 4,5 and 6) are the best.Episode 1 was a disappointment, Episode 2 was better and Episode 3 was closest to the original three.The special-effects may be dated as of today but back in 1977, it was simply amazing.Darth Vader is a very cool villain as well.The film is basically about a farmer named Luke Skywalker who with the help of a princess named Princess Leia,Han Solo a pilot,Obi-Wan an old Jedi-knight,two robots named C3P0 and R2D2(who are in all six Star Wars films) and Chewbacca, Han Solo's wookie friend, they must destroy Darth Vader's death star.Star Wars is a very entertaining sci-fi film and if you haven't seen it(you're in the minority) you must!",9,2,3,9 August 2007
300," A bit overrated but still an entertaining film
","MPAA Rating:Rated R for Strong Graphic Battle Violence and Sexual Content. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18AI saw 300 the day it came out.I am not the biggest fan of mythological battle films such as Troy or Alexander but they are pretty good.300 made a lot of money at the box office.In my opinion, it is the best Greek mythology film but I do find it overrated.I mean I don't think it should be in the Top 250.The acting was great.Gerald Butler gives an excellent performance.So does Rodrigo Santoro(the guy who played Xerces).Pretty much the entire cast acting well.The film has some very good one-liners.The most famous being 'This Is Sparta'.It is entertaining but I thought it could have been longer.300 is about 300 spartan men who basically 'Go The Distance' and fight thousands of Persian men and kill most of them.They lose in the end but they prove that a Persian god can bleed and that is one of the things they wanted to prove.If you are a big fan of Greek mythology films, then you will love 300!",8,1,3,1 July 2007
Pineapple Express," Great Seth Rogen stoner film
","Seth Rogen is a great actor/comedian in my opinion.Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad were excellent movies in my opinion, and those are just a few of the many other films he has played a role in.The film also stars James Franco of 'Spiderman' fame.It's been a while since I have seen this movie but what happens is a stoner witnesses a murder and gets his drug dealer involved.So they hide in the woods while the man sends two hit men to go kill them.Afterwords they leave the woods, try to get help from their friend, smoke some weed and then after the dealer gets kidnapped, the stoner goes and tries to save him.Pineapple Express was not as good as say Superbad or 40 Year Old Virgin in my opinion, but it was an entertaining stoner movie with a good mix of action and comedy.Seth Rogen fans, stoner film fans or fans of buddy comedies should check this movie out.",9,1,5,29 September 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Overrated? Yes, but still very funny and memorable.
","Monty Python and The Holy Grail has been listed by many as one of the greatest comedies of all time.First time watching this film, I sort of liked it, but I thought it was very overrated, and I didn't think it was as funny as everybody said it was.After watching it another time, I still think it's overrated, but I like it more.The plot involves the members of the Monty Python comedy troupe as knights searching for the holy grail.Along the way, they each encounter many weird and funny obstacles.This movie has some very memorable scenes such as the 'Knights Who Say...NI', a killer bunny rabbit, the black knight who just won't admit defeat(even after all his limbs are cut off) and many others.Yes, a lot of the comedy is fairly stupid, but you will still find it funny.This film is very entertaining. and also has a few interesting Terry Gilliam animations just like the TV series did.The film has a huge cult following as of now.I found it very funny, just not as uproarious as everybody claims it is.It does however, get better after watching it a few more times! It is definitely worth a watch if you like Monty Python, medieval movies, or just even comedies in general.",9,1,2,3 February 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best Star Wars film in the series
","Rated PG for Violence.The Star Wars series is the greatest sci-fi series of all time.I am not the only one who thinks this as the films have millions of fans.The series is very entertaining and while Mark Hamil's acting is not so good, you can overlook that with the special effects that were amazing when the film came out as well as a cool storyline and an interesting villain named Darth Vader.In this film there are two new characters that are introduced.They are Yoda and Lando Calrissian who are interesting characters.I think this one is the best in the series because it is the most interesting and the most fun to watch.",9,0,2,10 August 2007
Sin City," The best movie of 2005.
","Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence,nudity and sexual content including dialogue.I first saw Sin City when I rented it a year ago.Since then I have seen the film three times.Sin City is simply an amazing movie.I consider it to be my all time favorite movie.This movie is almost flawless.Some of the acting is good and some not as good.However aside from the acting this movie is excellent.Excellent plot,lots of violence,great special effects and it feels exactly like a graphic novel.Sin City is based on the graphic novels of the same name.The first film in the Sin City series(there is going to be a Sin City 2 and 3) is based on the first three graphic novels which are The Hard Goodbye,The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard.All those three amazing graphic novels are put together in one movie.There is a little skit at the beginning as well with Josh Hartnett.The first story The Hard Goodbye is about a very strong,ugly man named Marv.He wants to get revenge on the person who killed his prostitute.With the help of the prostitutes twin sister they both go searching for the killer and kill them.The second story The Big Fat Kill is about a couple of prostitutes who kill someone causing trouble without knowing he's a cop.The man who was with them disposes the bodies of the cop and his friends by going to the tar pits.However there are a lot of people who want the cops head.The third and final story is called That Yellow Bastard.It is the story of a cop who puts a pedophile in a coma.The father of the pedophile is a US senator and he wants the cop to say he was the pedophile.So he does and spends eight years in prison.When he gets out he looks for Nancy the little girl who is his only friend.He must protect her from the pedophile who becomes That Yellow Bastard.Sin City is an excellent film made up of three excellent stories.It is a must buy film!

","Rated R for Strong Violence,Language,Drug Use and Some Sexual Content. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:R(should be 18A)I saw Goodfellas one night on showcase action.I have been hearing great things about this film and Goodfellas definitely lives up to its hype.The film has an all star cast consisting of Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci,Robert DeNiro and a small part from Samuel L Jackson.This film also has four characters from The Sopranos acting in the film.The four characters from the sopranos in this film are Tony's Psychayatrist,Christopher,Paulie and Big P***y.Goodfellas is a nice long film with excellent acting,storyline and lots of entertainment value.The film shows the life of a mobster named Henry Hill and all the things he must do in the mafia life.Goodfellas is an entertaining mafia movie and fans of such mafia films will definitely want to buy goodfellas.Runtime:145min 10/10",9,0,1,21 August 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Simpsons fans will not be disappointed
","Rated PG-13 for Language,Some Violence and Brief Drug Use.This Simpsons is one of the greatest animated shows of all time! Matt Groening is a genius! 18 years(20 if you count the short films released before on the Tracey Ullman show) and he has not run out of ideas.Im surprised that they haven't made a Simpsons movie until now.I mean South Park made a movie in two years.A lot of people say that the show is not good anymore, I disagree, The Simpsons was always awesome and is still awesome.When I heard there was a Simpsons movie coming out I was excited so I went to see it the first day it came out and guess what, It does not disappoint.The humor in the Simpsons movie is just as funny and fresh as it was in the cartoons.The film has a storyline you can expect from most animated films.Its entertaining but there isn't really much to the story.While Homer is eating at Krusty Burger, he finds that they are about to kill a pig.The pig runs to him so Homer decides to take him in.Homer basically has lots of fun with the pig like in the infamous 'Spider Pig' scene while Bart feels neglected and starts taking a liking to Flanders.Meanwhile, Homer dumps a silo of 'pig crap' into Lake Springfield which is on the verge of being polluted.After this, the government seals springfield in a circular glass dome.When the springfielders find out it was Homer's fault, they all try to kill him, but they find a way out of the dome and they go live in Alaska.When the government finds out about this, they decide to destroy Springfield killing everybody.So now its up to the Simpsons family to save them all.The Simpsons movie is very entertaining and definitely a must see for any Simpsons fan.",9,3,10,28 July 2007
Evil Dead II," A funny and gory zombie movie
","Rated R for Strong Violence/Gore. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:R(should be 18A)Evil Dead II is the second film in the Evil Dead trilogy.I have not seen Evil Dead 1 or Evil Dead 3:Army Of Darkness.I really enjoyed Evil Dead II.Its a fun b-rated zombie movie filled with gore and comedy.I didn't see the first movie but from what I read, it was a pure zombie horror movie with no comedy.Evil Dead II and III however have a good mix of horror and comedy.There is a little recap at the beginning of the film with different actors/actresses from the first movie so some people think this is a remake.But it is a sequel.Ash is still in the cabin fighting off deadites and trying to get rid of them with two archaeologists and two rednecks.This time he has a chainsaw for a hand and a sawn off shotgun which he calls his 'Boomstick'.He uses it to kill the zombies(deadites).With a surprising ending, Evil Dead II is a very fun and gory horror movie that I recommend to horror fans.9/10",9,2,3,13 June 2007
V for Vendetta," Interesting at times though overrated
","Rated R for strong violence and some language.I saw V For Vendetta a few months ago on the movie network.It was a pretty good movie.The acting was good and the storyline was good as well.The film was pretty strange and I don't think it should be rated so highly in IMDb's Top 250 films list.It is based on the graphic novel of the same name.The film takes place in the future and is about a terrorist named V, he saves a girl from being raped one day and in turn she becomes his assistant though initially not wanting anything to do with V.The entire film makes a jab at politics.V For Vendetta is a fairly interesting film and I recommend it.",7,2,7,23 August 2007
The Godfather," Okay maybe its a bit overrated, but its still an amazing movie!(might contain some spoilers)
","Rated R for Strong Violence,Sexual Content and Some Language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18AThe Godfather is the number 1 movie on IMDb's Top 250 movies list.It won best picture at the academy awards.It has been praised by critics and it spawned two sequels.I don't think it should be the number 1 movie in the Top 250(dont ask me what should because I am not really sure) but Godfather is a very amazing movie and its definitely in my Top 10 movie list.This is one of the first and greatest mafia movies ever made.It has excellent acting, an excellent storyline, it is a great adaptation of a great book, it has an all star cast of Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Robert Duvall,Talia Shire,Diane Keaton and others.I can see why some people may not like it.I can see it being boring for some people but I find it one of the few long movies that keep me interested until the end.The movie is about a mafia don, who gets shot and this sparks a war between the five mafia families of new york.Their son Michael(Al Pacino) is an army veteran who does not want to get involved in the family business but ends up being the don(sorry about the spoiler).The movie has a great ending as well.This movie was fairly violent for 1972 but is tame by today's standards.In conclusion the godfather is an excellent mafia movie but it is a little overrated.Godfather Part 2 is almost as good, Part 3 is not as good as the first two but still good despite what most think.",9,1,3,20 June 2007
