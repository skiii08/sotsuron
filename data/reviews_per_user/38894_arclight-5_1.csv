The Blair Witch Project," If you want to be scared don't watch this
","This movie was supposed to be scary?!?!?!Will someone out there please tell me was so scary?The only scary part is there are people out there that like this movie and think it is scary.You have three idiots who get lost in the forest,curse like sailors at each other,hear weird noises in the forest(that was the ONLY thing in the entire movie that was remotely scary)and then eventually get killed.If you have motion sickness,don't watch.The camera is all over the place.Up,down,sideways but rarely still.People talked about how this movie will revolutionize the industry because you don't need millions to make a great movie.WHO CARES!first of all this movie was not great,it stinks.Crap is crap and this was a stink fest.Anyone who thought this movie was scary probably scared of their own shadow.It wasn't the worst movie ever made but it was close.",1,2,4,9 May 2005
