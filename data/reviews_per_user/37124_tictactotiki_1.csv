Child 44," Hardy and Kinnaman, what a treat, 2 most awesome actors, as always Hardy and Kinnaman 100% owned their characters.
","Depressing and horrific storyline, made worse in that it was based on true events, the only reason why i stuck with it, as it was very hard to follow at times, was because of Hardy and Kinnaman who both turned out Oscar earning performances.
it was a bit confusing, but in reality i guess those times were confusing.
In all a brilliant watch, which is haunting and stays with you for days after watching.",10,0,0,4 June 2020
