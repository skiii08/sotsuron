10 Cloverfield Lane," The aliens were unneeded
","It was a great film was really enjoyable but it could've just ended with her taking the mask off then going to live her life, no one would've complained. Just found the alien bit just unnecessary but all in all the film was actually good and I'd fully recommend.",7,0,0,17 May 2020
Hereditary," Horrendous
","That was the biggest waste of time ever. I strongly recommend you not watch this film, the rating is a complete lie. If you have a brain listen to me and please for the love of god don't watch this crap.",2,0,3,16 February 2019
Detroit," Wow
",That film was amazing in my opinion. It was so intriguing and touching I could easily watch that film over and over again. It's a long film but that time flew by. Will Poulter was the stand out actor he played his role to perfection.,8,1,3,9 March 2019
Lone Survivor," Absolutely incredible film
",That film was absolutely amazing to watch I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's absolutely crazy to think that actually happened to some soldiers. The acting was absolutely class all round and would highly recommend this film to anyone it's impossible not to like it.,9,1,2,4 March 2020
Fury," What an incredible film
","That was genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The acting from everyone involved was out of this world, that group of Actors are some of the best actors of our generation. It genuinely annoys me that it took me this long to watch it. If anyone is even debating to watch it, just watch it you won't be let down.",10,1,4,2 December 2019
The Maze Runner," Better then expected
",I went into this thinking it was going to be a very average film but I was very wrong. The story was good and It was moderately easy to follow. I'm definitely going to watch the second one and hope it as good if not better then this one.,8,0,0,20 September 2019
Captain Marvel," Throughly enjoyed
",I very much enjoyed that film. I thought it started quite slowly and I was a little lost but picked up and was very intriguing. Also Samuel L Jackson was really really funny.,7,2,7,19 March 2019
World War Z," Absolute banger
","That was amazing, finally a zombie film where the zombies are actually a problem not just zombies that walk at 1mph. Brad Pitt is 100% one of the greatest of out generation. Great film and fully can't wait for the second one hope it comes out soon as possible.",8,0,1,11 May 2020
The Impossible," They forgot you know, the tsunami
","They could've gone into more detail on the actual tsunami not just a 5 minute part of the film. I would've loved to have known how the dad and two little kids got on during the tsunami. Also how was the dad completely battered and bruised but the two kids he had held of didn't even have a scratch on them. Also it was so stupid how the dad went to the hospital and barley looked around he literally had a quick look for like 5 minutes. Tom Holland was really good to be fair, the only saving grace. Also how was Naomi watts nominated for an Oscar she was lead in an hospital bed for half the film.",4,0,1,11 May 2020
Us," Was expecting better
","Was hoping for a lot better then that. People hyped it up to be an amazing film that was better then get out but us doesn't even compare in my opinion.
In my opinion it wasn't really a horror Is was more a thriller, I get scared really easily and I wasn't scared once during this.
Also I don't understand how all these freaks with scissors can take out an entire state of people are you trying to tell me no one with a gun can just take them out because the black family took out 8 of them but the rest of the people can't take out any Abit weird that.",5,1,1,16 April 2019
Don Jon," Pointless
","The characters were incredibly unlikeable and there was no point to the film, the film was literally pointless. That was literally just time of my life that I'll never get back.",2,3,4,24 November 2019
Zodiac," Outstanding
",I thought that was incredible i was incredibly invested for the entire film. The film didn't feel as long as it was which Is perfect for a film this long. The acting from Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible as you'd expect was a pleasure to watch. I was close to giving this a 10 but I settled on 9 which was a very hard decision.,9,0,1,7 May 2020
The Prestige," Wowwwwwww that was incredible
","That has slotted into my top 5 favourite films of all time at number 2. I'm shocked Hugh or Bale didn't win an Oscar for this, they were both incredible. 100% one of the best films I've ever seen. I can't believe it took me this long to watch this. Absolutely incredible wow",10,0,0,13 May 2020
Ready Player One," Don't normally like films like this but it's a banger
",This visuals and the special effects are out of this world. It's Abit complicated at times but I followed it all the way through. Wade was a bit of a wet Flannel at times but it is what it is. Genuinely just a really fun film that didn't feel as long as it was which is perfect for a film over two hours.,8,1,2,6 May 2020
The Hateful Eight," Wasn't what I expected
",I was hoping it was going to be like a proper western movie but it wasn't quite different from that. I thought it was unnecessarily long. It made me laugh at times which is good and bad because I don't really watch western crime films to make me laugh. The acting was good not really a bad watch I just expected better.,6,0,1,23 October 2019
Snatch," Incredible film
","I don't normally like English films but this one was incredible. Was pleasantly surprised by Vinnie Jones, he can actually act. Obviously brad Pitt was amazing usual but what else would you expect. What makes the film more impressive, the budget was tiny.",9,1,2,5 April 2020
The Town," Ben afflecks accent really annoyed me
",The film was really good proper enjoyed it but I thought Ben affleck was the wrong choice for the main role because his accent was terrible. But putting that aside it was a good film with a good ending and a lot of action. I'd definitely recommend.,7,0,0,13 April 2020
Shutter Island," Holy hell what an incredible film
","I could go on for ages about how good and mind boggling this film is but the rating speaks for its self this is a must watch, can't wait it's taken me until now to watch this.",10,0,0,11 March 2020
Interstellar," Amazing, but oh boy it is complicated
",Genuinely incredible film but it's a proper thinker so you have to be completely locked in from the first minute of the film to the last. The CGI was really impressive in this. I'm not normally a fan of matthew mcconaughey but he was incredible in this and it's completely changed my view of him.,8,0,0,7 May 2020
American Hustle," That was brilliant
",The acting from all round was amazing. I find it very hard to believe that Christian bale didn't win a major award for his role I thought he was the stand out actor in this along side Jennifer Lawrence. It's crazy what Bale puts his body through for roles. The ending was perfect it ended exactly how I wanted it to.,9,1,1,11 May 2020
Split," Did not get that at all
","I thought that was really bad and I really struggled to follow the story. The three girls had numerous occasions to kill the guy and they just didn't it was so frustrating. The only positive from this film is that the guys acting was quality and Hayley Lu is gorgeous and that's it, not impressed.",3,0,3,14 March 2019
Jarhead," Very enjoyable
","I enjoyed that very much the acting all round was really good, but Jake gyllenhaal was the clear standout performance. I liked the way it showed the way people start to lose their minds. It was a serious film but it had a lot of funny moments which made the film a lot more enjoyable.",7,0,0,1 February 2020
Dunkirk," Class film
","I'm massively enjoyed that, I liked the fact it just go straight into it because most war films always start slow. It was a great insight into what it was like in Dunkirk. The acting was really good from all the young actors. Would highly recommend.",8,0,0,10 March 2020
The Machinist," Incredible performance by Christian Bale
",I can't believe how thin Christian bale is in this it's actually sickening but you can't deny his dedication to his role. His performance was incredible and fun to watch. This film kept me thinking all the time and I'm incredibly happy it answered all the questions at the end. Strongly recommend this film.,8,0,1,19 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Wowzer
","So iron man dies saving everyone, not going to lie I totally saw that coming",9,0,5,27 April 2019
Gone Girl," incredible but not as good as prisoners
","That was incredible was hooked from the very beginning. Was dark and twisted and absolutely loved it. However Is it better then prisoners nope, sorry. Prisoners is a 10 gone girl is 9. Annoyed it took me this long to watch it for the first time though.",9,0,0,16 March 2020
Prisoners," Outstanding
",That's was outstanding I was hooked instantly. The acting from Jake Gyllanhaal and Hugh Jackman was amazing. Was on the edge of my seat the entire film. there's loads of twists and turns and I really enjoyed and would fully recommend it to anyone.,10,3,4,7 September 2019
Logan," Absolutely incredible
",That was amazing I can't understand how you could rate this under an 8. You don't really need to have watched x men to follow this. The fights scenes were incredible to watch. I clocked towards the end he was definitely going to die there was no way he was going to survive the film but it still crushed me when he died.,9,0,0,22 April 2020
Everest," Just couldn't get into it at all
","The film just never hooked me. It was sad see all them people die knowing that actually happened. There was too many characters to know what was going on I never had any idea who was who. It never really focused on anyone so I couldn't connect with any of the characters. Also how cool was jake gyllenhaal's character, was very gutted he died.",5,0,0,20 March 2020
Limitless," Well that was a whole lot of nothing
","The film was just building up and up and up for what I thought was going to an incredible ending that would make the film and I couldn't have been more wrong. The film itself was actually decent, kept me thinking but the ending was horrendous.",5,1,3,12 April 2020
12 Years a Slave," Simply Brilliant
",It was an incredible watch and It showed what life was like as a slave and it showed all the cruel punishments in detail. At times it was hard to watch when people were getting whipped. Towards the end when Patsey was getting whipped I genuinely couldn't watch it looked massively painful. The ending was also incredibly heart warming. It's absolutely crazy to me that this is a true story.,8,0,0,24 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Very good and scary
","I really enjoyed it and it scared the life out of me a lot of times. There's not really much more you can ask for in a horror. You go to get scared and I got scared.
The only thing that annoys me about the film is the way they killed the clown. They literally killed him by insulting him, surely they could've thought of a better way. And please tell me I wasn't the only one who shed a tear when Eddie died that proper hit me hard.",7,0,0,11 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," I thought that was class
",I don't understand the rating of 6.6 because I thought it was amazing. The graphics and special effects were incredible. The Acting was really good definitely nothing to complain about. I'd fully recommend anyone to watch this and you won't be disappointed,8,4,5,23 October 2019
Defiance," Slowwwwwwww
","I'm going to keep this short, it was way to slow. It was unnecessarily long and I couldn't stand Daniel Craig's accent, as soon as I heard it I couldn't get passed it. It was a good storey to do a film on but I think it could've been done a whole lot better.",4,0,1,19 March 2020
Mother!," I hated it
","I can't lie to you it's horrendous, it's incredibly hard to follow, it's weird and confusing and there's no way it could be under the title horror. If you wanna watch a horror then I strongly recommend you don't watch this.",2,7,10,9 September 2019
Lucy," Absolutely shocking, complete Waste of time
",That's 100% of the worst films I've ever seen. Made absolutely no sense. There's literally nothing else I can say other then it was horrendous please don't watch it. People who saying they understand it are clearly lying to look smart.,1,2,6,17 May 2020
Unbroken," What's with all that negative reviews
","I enjoyed that massively. It did go on a tad longer then it should have but I didn't mind that at all. Jack O'Connell can act, he was absolutely superb and a joy to watch. I'm actually not family with the true story so I don't know if it's right or wrong but I enjoyed it that's the whole reason I watch films and it's for the enjoyment. I also think Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job as director and I don't get the criticism, I think people are just being picky.",7,0,0,12 March 2020
Looper," Please thumbs me down, I don't see the hype
","That was terrible, I've never watched something harder to follow in my life. It literally made no sense, I'm convinced people just say they know what's going on just act smart. This has definitely certified that sci-fi films just aren't it.",2,3,7,5 April 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Phenomenal
",It was an amazing film and an absolute joy to watch literally only have one bad thing to say about it. The second of the film was a 10 out of 10 but the first part dragged a little bit more then it should of thats my only negative thing to say. I thought vince Vaughn was played his role incredibly. I also thought it was a nice touch to add the actual heroes at the end of the film.,8,2,2,8 March 2020
13 Hours," Absolutely incredible
",I absolutely love war films and I loved this i was absolutely locked in for the entire film. I've been flickering with 9 and 10 for ages a 9.5 would be spot on. Every about the film was brilliant I have no cons about the film only pros. The fight scenes were riveting and exciting. The acting from everyone was perfect. John krasinski showing once again he can act.,9,0,0,7 March 2020
Warm Bodies," Got better as the film went on
",After the first 30 minutes I was really regretting my choice of film but it get way better as the film went on. I don't normally like romantic films but I actually fair enjoyed this. Would recommend,7,0,0,5 May 2020
The Martian," Wow just wow
","Was absolutely amazed by this definitely didn't feel as long as it was which was perfect. Matt Damon was brilliant absolute joy to watch. I'm annoyed it took me this long to watch this, disappointed in my self. I fully recommend this to anyone and everyone.",9,0,0,1 May 2020
The Fighter," Masterpiece
","Was an absolute joy to watch and I'm annoyed it took me this long to watch it. I'm not familiar with the original story because I'm too young but I did some research and they portrayed brilliantly. Mark and Christian played they're rolls perfectly. However Christian bale stood out massively he is an incredible actor, one of the best of our generation. I'm extremely glad he won an Oscar for his performance. It's a great story to do a film on.",9,0,0,10 March 2020
