Miracle," It's Jim Craig the goal-tender, not Jim Clark
","And you're from Minnesota? Get a clue, you frozen idiot.I can't believe you'd leave a message here and think you'd have a shread of credibility stating 'Jim Clark' instead of 'Jim Craig.'Are you retarded?Jim Craig is a legend.His U.S. flag-draped image after winning the gold in the 1980 Olympics is legendary.How could you get his name wrong?You must be brain-damaged.Get your facts right before posting here.And watch 'Miracle' again so you can at least get the names right.",10,2,4,3 July 2009
