Skyfall," 007's 50th Anniversary is celebrated in style.
","Skyfall is notable for two reasons, it is the first Bond movie to have an Oscar winning director at the helm, and it has been released on the 50th Birthday of this most celebrated and quintessentially British franchise. These two elements, along with a fine cast, tight plot and supremely intelligent scripting make this one of the best Bonds ever.Yes, this may seem like a bold statement, but it can be justified. The opening sequence is a masterclass in action set pieces, Mendes proving in the first 10 minutes his Bond will be no pushover in the action stakes. In fact, no action in Skyfall fails to thrill, and they all differentiate nicely (unlike Quantum's dull, Bourne carbon copy fist fights). More important than the action, is the wit and humour the script gives Craig, who, whilst considered the best Bond since Connery, has been criticised for his distinct lack of a sense of humour. Indeed, in Skyfall, Craig becomes the perfect Bond, successfully balancing the brooding with enough dry witticisms. Suitably for this momentous occasion, Mendes' film manages to reinvigorate 007 as well as celebrating it. The re inclusion of Q and the classic gadget filled Aston Martin DB5 help achieve this. Another throwback is the inclusion of a proper Bond villain, eccentric Cyber Terrorist Raoul Silva, played with creepy style and charisma by the ever impressive Javier Bardem, accentuates the feeling of evolution and wistful nostalgia. The tight plot keeps the action coming, and provides some truly brilliant moments. Most importantly, however, is the exploration of Bond and M's (an outstanding Judi Dench), that manages to ring true emotion, a treat rarely experienced in a Bond movie. Even if the climax only manages to disappoint, the wonderful epilogue brings Skyfall back to undeniable brilliance.Verdict: Skyfall manages to be cool, emotionally charged and witty whilst in no way sacrificing action. 007 is back.",9,2,17,31 October 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," A thrilling, action packed adventure with charm and spectacular visuals
","Let's be honest here, Spielberg's Indy 4 was flat, CG heavy and, well, just plain stupid. It was the biggest disappointment since The Phantom Menace. However, with the help of Motion capture and a superb John Williams score, the director has finally got his mojo back. Tintin starts at breakneck speed, flowing seamlessly from scene to scene,the pace only lagging at the poorly written Thompson and Thomson scenes. You can tell that Spielberg is loving the freedom of Mo cap tech, giving him unrivalled visual freedom, delivering a stunningly beautiful adventure. Tintin is a likable and straightforward, whilst Snowy the dog and Andy Serkis's scene stealing Captain Haddock provide welcome comic relief and charm. Elsewhere, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost fail to breathe life into Thompson and Thomson, mainly due to the childish and unfunny jokes they are given and Daniel Craig makes for a reliable, if unspectacular villain. Then to the action. Stylishly choreographed and thrilling, Tintin's action rivals that of the Indy trilogy, in terms of white knuckle, relentless thrills. The Adventures of Tintin is Steven Spielberg's true Indy trilogy successor.",Null,0,3,11 November 2011
Watchmen," Watchmen is undeniably brilliant as a graphic novel adaptation.
","Despite all the signs saying it would never in a million years be remade (i.e Gilliam dropping out, Greengrass being refused sufficient financial backing), Watchmen has been made, and it has been made well.Whilst there were well placed worries that the novel's widespread, complex storytelling and strong political and social messages would be lost in the harsh world of cut editing and running time restrictions, Zack Snyder has managed to hue his film with enough faithfulness and skill to satisfy the fan and uninitiated alike. The action, although being in stylistic slow-mo, is thrilling and nicely executed, the tone is in just the right place between gritty and fantastical and most of the actors, Wilson especially, portray their characters with skill and charisma, two necessities for a story so deep and at times hard to follow. Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley impress the most, with Wilson bringing his Nite Owl some much needed charm and soft humour, whilst also becoming the character Moore intended him to be, an impotent Batman mixed with a mid-life crisis Clark Kent. Haley, with possibly the coolest character, imbues Rorschach with a very hard edge, and somehow manages to make Rorschach's horrific actions in the film justifiable. Less successful, however, is Matthew Goode, who botches line readings and Veidt comes across as a dull and, despite the meticulous detail and attention Moore wrote him with, Goode's Veidt is one-note and 2- dimensional. Akerman and Crudup are passable, if hardly noteworthy, as Silk Spectre and Dr Manhatten.Snyder's determination to use music and slow motion so much within the movie means that some of the scenes, like the strange Owl Ship sex scene, fall flat and come across as crass and empty. However, where the movie scores so highly is in the fantastic visuals, that perfectly captures the fantastical yet very scarily realistic alternate universe these characters live in. In sticking so closely with the graphic novel, and thanks to the superb cast, Watchmen, whilst being a visual stunning and thrilling superhero movie, is also a dark and engrossing character study set in the paranoia and secretive Cold War era, perfectly used here. Though it doesn't quite reach for the perfect adaptation that matches the book, this comes very close.",8,0,4,5 November 2012
Saving Private Ryan," A powerful,emotional and uncompromising war epic.
","The first half an hour of Saving Private Ryan is pure cinematic brilliance. Bullets whoosh past, soldiers search through the blood drenched sea bed for their broken limb, cry for their mums as their guts squeeze out of their stomach. It's scarily realistic, mentally scarring and utterly compelling. Although the rest of the film doesn't reach the dizzy heights the first 20 minutes managed to, it comes damn near close.Tom Hanks once again shows his charisma, versatility and range,in the role of Capt.Miller assuring us still that he is one of the best a-list actors around. The supporting cast more than match him, the pick of the bunch being Tom Sizemore as a reliable Sergeant. Spielberg's ambition and emotionally resonant directing makes sure that this film hits all the right footnotes, from unflinching battle scenes to emotional speeches. The only thing that holds this back is the script's nack of sneaking slightly into sentiment, especially in the prologue and the epilogue. But that is just a minor bum note in an ultimately groundbreaking, powerful war movie classic.",10,1,2,6 June 2011
Inception," With such a unique and astonishing idea, and with a great central performance, this could be the film of the year.
","I was worried that I would be sitting in the cinema for 2 and a half hours not having a clue what was going on, but actually, the film made more and more sense as it went on, and the idea was completely and utterly infectious, I couldn't help but sit there and be amazed by it. The central performance by DiCaprio was fantastic, putting in his heart and soul into it, and he led it with such gravitas and gusto. The supporting cast were good too, all very well executed, but it was DiCaprio most wanted to see. The action sequences brilliant, with a gravity defying hotel room fight being the pick of the bunch. Nolan's perception and execution of a genius idea is wonderful, anyone else would have seen it and said 'this is unfilmable', but not him, he tricks us all with this, taking us one way, then turning sharply the next. But inception isn't flawless. The first 30 minutes I found were difficult to work out, which wasn't a bad thing, it was a good beginning, and it set the tone for the rest of the film, and I understood that Nolan wasn't going to give us time to think. As it went on, it slowly unravelled itself, and I understood, to a degree. As well as that, there wasn't a lot of laughing to be had, the humour was few and far between. But that depends on what you were expecting. For what it is, Inception is probably the best in the genre yet.",9,2,5,24 July 2010
