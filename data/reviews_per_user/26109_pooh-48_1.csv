The Blair Witch Project," Creative spine-tingler
","While this movie didn't 'scare the crap out of me' as other reviewers have stated, I did find it very unnerving and disturbing.  The hand-held camera work and black-out scenes (where only the various noises can be heard) were amazingly effective at keeping the viewer off-balance.  It definitely gave me chills up my spine.  This is one of the most creative and innovative films I've seen in a long time.  It's great to see a low-budget movie like this get such great exposure.",8,1,1,31 July 1999
