Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Did anyone else's jaw drop at the underwater city?
","Krumski from Cincy, Ohio made a good point about the best action in Eps. IV - VI blindsiding you; with that in mind, I'm surprised more people haven't commented on the first view we get of the Gungan underwater city, hanging precariously in the deep. That's the one moment in this film that had my jaw on the floor, the lightsaber duel coming in a close second. I have to agree that this film could have used more heart and a Han Solo archetype to balance out the seriousness; perhaps those two would go hand-in-hand.  It's an entertaining film, but not much more than that.  One final thought:  a lot of people, including author Peter David, are bitching about how the midi-chlorians have invalidated the whole spiritual basis of the Force.  Has anyone thought that it might be a great big red herring?  Think how silly you'll feel if I'm right.  Thank you for reading and may the Force be with you 'til Episode II.",Null,0,1,4 March 2000
Pitch Black," What the hey is that
","Rasto and Stu watched this one.  Boba washed the dishes while it was playing.  Rasto and Stu said it was about a bunch of retards running around on a planet being chased by aliens.  They both fell asleep in the middle of the movie; from boredom as opposed to lack of sleep.  Oh well what can I say.  Until next time... please excuse us, we have to return some videotapes.",Null,0,0,8 January 2001
American Psycho," I am one hundred percent with you.
","Very crazy movie.  We liked the part where Bateman is getting it on with the two prostitutes, and points at himself in the mirror as if to say 'You're Number One!'  Also good was the examination of the hypocrisy between the supposed 'friends' at Bateman's job, ie. how they compare their business cards.  The soundtrack, and Bateman's accompanying praise for each song played, was also highly amusing.  Very good acting all around.  And now, if you'll excuse us, we have to return some videotapes.",Null,0,1,8 January 2001
Bring It On," Clever spirit fingers
","So......... anyway.  This wasn't a bad show.  Kirsten Dunst's little brother was a funny little S.O.B.  The car wash scene was even better than the locker room scene (way to buff job that car hood, honey!)  Sparky the Dance Dictator was also amusing with his 'spirit fingers' and his clever way of separating desperate cheerleaders from their parents' money.  All in all, this was more entertaining than we expected.  And now if you'll excuse us... we have to return some videotapes.",Null,0,0,12 March 2001
Carrie," It must've been hard for Spacek to get dates after this...
","My earliest memory of this movie is when, at the age of five, I walked in on my cousin watching it on TV at my Grandpa's house. Carrie had just gotten the pig's blood dumped on her at the prom and proceeded to try on a thousand-yard stare; my fragile little mind was forever warped.  Having just seen this in its entirety, that image still gets me. The rest was not too shabby either; Spacek especially makes you want to give her a big hug and beat the crap out of everyone who picks on her, at least before she shows us that she does not need a hug.  That said, I think it would've been more tragic/ironic if Travolta and Allen's characters had gotten away clean for having initiated all the misery.  Minor complaint, though.  My pick for Metallica song to play along with this movie is Unforgiven II; crank it up for the big finish.  And remember, kids, be nice to the quiet ones... they're the ones you gotta watch out for.",Null,0,0,6 January 2000
Final Destination," Then who's next? Hopefully not whoever reads this...
","I watched this with my roommates.  It started OK with the plane going kablooey and shattering the windows in the airport.  The characters were allright; my buddy Rasto the Slovakian Savage called Carter Horton a 'puncher' and said 'what is wrong with this f**ker?  He is big puncher.' The end really blew, with Puncher asking ' then who's next?' and, well, you'll see.  A simple review for a really simple movie.",Null,1,1,8 January 2001
Tarzan," Why does the hunter always have to be the bad guy?
","I watched this film with some friends and their little ones a few days ago. On the plus side, it moves like a tornado, the animation is phenomenal, and it actually managed to make me like Phil Collins' music.  My big problem with this movie, and many Disney movies period, is that the hunter is ALWAYS THE BAD GUY. I actually know a hunter/trapper named Clayton; he and his wife and kids have been friends of my family for a long time.  He is nothing like the idiot in this film.  He is witty, worldly-wise and technically inclined (an ironworker by trade).  He tells stories with language that's more than a bit colourful, but immediately puts you at ease because he uses it for punctuation rather than intimidation.  His three daughters all got married last year, the happiness of which was muted somewhat by his wife being diagnosed with cancer.  It might just be me, but I figure that these people are no better or worse than everyone else; they have lives and personalities like you and I.  I always thought Disney entertainment was supposed to uphold tolerance for divergent views and lifestyles; apparently they'll make exceptions for activities that aren't politically correct. I find this very insulting.  If Disney doesn't like my opinion, they should stop cross-promoting with McDonald's et al, which probably kills more animals than hunters each year.  I sincerely hope that people who watch this movie will keep in mind that people are more complex than Disney would have you believe.",Null,0,1,9 May 2000
