Blade Runner 2049," 'A stunning sequel that truly belongs.'
","Blade Runner 2049 is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Ryan Gosling, Ana de Armas, Robin Wright, Jared Leto, Sylvia Hoeks, Harrison Ford, Mackenzie Davis and Dave Bautista.A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years. (15 cert, 163 mins)The year is 1982. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner has been poorly received in its theatrical run. Jump forward to 2017. Blade Runner is widely regarded as one of the most skilfully crafted world-building sci-fi achievements in film history. A sequel is upon us. Blade Runner 2049 is here. But how does it perform? Does it require you watch the original? The answers I give you are simple and will not spoil a thing.Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors working today. Arrival. Sicario. Incendies. Prisoners. Enemy. He has an incredible body of work to fall back on. When I heard the news of Villeneuve directing a new Blade Runner, I was intrigued. I knew that he could create something truly brilliant, and he has. To answer the questions above; it performs extremely well. Not only does it continue the story faithfully, it's perfectly able to stand on its own. However, I'd highly recommend watching the original before seeing this. Like it or not, it acts as the foundation for this sequel. Despite the huge gap between the two films, the story and characters feel consistent. It hasn't been tacked on just to earn money, in fact the box office numbers prove otherwise. This is a worthy sequel that truly belongs.Ryan Gosling leads with what looks to be a simple, single-shaded character but as the film unfolds, the layers of his performance do so too. By the film's end we are totally connected to Officer K, just as much as Deckard, played by Harrison Ford in a surprisingly strong and brilliant returning act. Alongside the aforementioned are a talented range of actors who each bring life to their wonderfully textured characters. Robin Wright is remarkable. Jared Leto performs with complexity, creating the strange yet fascinating presence of Niander Wallace. Sylvia Hoeks is the menacing Luv, and one of my favourite performers in the film. Ana de Armas and Mackenzie Davis are both delightful supplements. This cast is incredible.Just as before, the futuristic vision of Los Angeles is intricately created and every single set and location looks the part. I'd liked to have seen more of the dystopian city, but I have to admire the direction to delve into the unfamiliar and expand the world of Blade Runner. It's been 30 years since Deckard disappeared, so you'd expect some advancement in technology and whilst there may be slight improvements, the world is at a stand-still after the 'blackout' 27 years prior.After working together on two projects previously, Villeneuve enlists Roger Deakins as director of photography and the result is stunning. Each frame tops the last. Even in its state of stillness the camera feels very much alive. Somehow, Deakins manages to capture the bleakness in such a way that it's simply beautiful to look at. Even when the film reaches its slower moments you can rely on the cinematography to keep you invested. Paired with this is the incredible sound design, tearing through the frames like a knife to a painting, but in no bad way. This leads me onto something very important; music.The music was such a huge part of the original Blade Runner, with Vangelis' beautiful synth-driven score. In order for 2049 to fully return us to that world, it required a worthy composer. Given Villeneuve's relationship with Jóhann Jóhannsson, it was no question he would take on the challenge. However, as the film neared completion the music wasn't capturing the feel intended, and so Jóhannsson was out. With very little time, Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer stepped up and provided the film with some of the best synth work I've heard in years. It's dark. It's gritty. It's loud. Most importantly, it captures the sound of Vangelis' work on the original, but takes it in a whole new twisted direction. The duo have delivered something that may split audiences. It's not as melodically pleasing as I'd hoped, and I could wish for more cues like 'Mesa,' but I truly believe the score fits perfectly in the atmosphere of this film. It doesn't shatter what was created before, that goes for the music and the film itself. It simply builds upon these creations and provides a faithful continuation. Here's how I'd put it; Vangelis created warmth, Wallfisch & Zimmer created coldness. Watch both films with that in mind and you'll start to notice it.Without saying too much; I found it to be better than the first, most notably in the storytelling. Beyond a few moments of slow-pacing, I can't fault it. This will go on to be a sci-fi classic, without a doubt.Verdict; Blade Runner 2049 is a stunning sequel that truly belongs. A careful continuation, yet standing on its own. This is one of Denis Villeneuve's best works.Blade Runner 2049 – ★★★★★ (9/10)",9,3,14,8 October 2017
Zootopia," Heartfelt and extremely fun.
","Zootropolis is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore & Jared Bush and stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Nate Torrence and many, many more.Judy Hopps is a courageous rabbit who has only one wish, to be an officer in the Zootropolis police force. Though, after a day in the city, she learns how tough it is to strive in enforcing the law. After attempting to prove herself to her boss Chief Bogo, who doesn't believe in Hopps, she hatches a plan with mischievous fox Nick Wilde to crack a conspiracy case much bigger than themselves.Zootropolis is a stunning combination of fun and heart. It has laughs and it has drama. It's beautifully animated and carefully thought through with a story filled with adult themes as well as the usual child-friendly humour. The movie picks at a lot of the problems our world is currently suffering from, so the timing couldn't be more perfect.Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman have admirable chemistry as our misfit pair of heroes and push the story along gracefully. There are a lot of fun characters that instantly become highlights such as Flash the Sloth and Clawhauser the ZPD receptionist. There are many references to other movies and TV shows including Breaking Bad and The Godfather which are very secretive for the younger audience but hilariously obvious for the adults. I love everything about this movie. The original score by Michael Giacchino is pumping with life and energy. Including many instruments catered to the scenes, this is another fantastic frame of work by Giacchino that will please fans and audiences alike. It's fun, action-packed and features loads of refreshing sounds & melodies.The animation is smooth and incredibly detailed throughout, with an extreme amount of colour and being. There's lots going on around the main characters and will open the eyes a little more than any of Disney's previous efforts. My verdict; Zootropolis packs a punch with a talented cast, a fun screenplay, crazy action and a whole lot of awesome music by Giacchino. This is yet another brilliant piece of work by Disney and will undoubtedly do wonders in the domestic and international box office. This is just as much one for the adults as it is for the younger audience. Zootropolis, 8/10.",8,6,13,3 April 2016
The Danish Girl," Remarkable, but not a masterpiece.
","The Danish Girl is directed by Tom Hooper and stars Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, Ben Whishaw and Matthias Schoenaerts. Loosely inspired by Danish artists Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe, The Danish Girl explores the marriage of Lili & Gerda as they experience Lili's ambitious journey as a transgender pioneer.Eddie Redmayne returns to the screen with admirable strength and skill, with such a diverse character to play. He is as convincing as Lili Elbe as he was Stephen Hawking. With his incredible portrayal in The Theory Of Everything, capturing everyone and gaining major attention from critics and the Academy, Redmayne is an actor who has stepped into the spotlight for filmmakers. And respectfully so. His portrayal of Lili in this film is remarkable, well handled and instantly worthy of the recognition. He gives off an electrifying performance and very emotionally attaches himself to the personality of this character. A truly brilliant performance. Alicia Vikander is magnetic as Gerda, she just clicks. Again, a very emotional performance throughout. I do believe she deserves more attention from the critics than she's getting at the moment. These are two of the four outstanding factors of this film. The third is the music by Alexandre Desplat. Absolutely beautiful piano melodies and string motifs as usual. He always writes with impeccable focus on the visuals and the touching performances on-screen. This is yet another score by Desplat that I will be happily purchasing.The final pillar holding this film up is the visuals. The camera work is stunningly supportive of the story and screenplay. Slow, intimate and colourful.Apart from these four points, I couldn't really attach myself to the film or its story. I felt it outstayed it's welcome after the 90 minute mark. If it were shorter by around 20-30 minutes I believe it would have flowed easier with less moments that felt out of place or less meaningful. Which is a bit sad when this is a story about such a compelling and controversial subject. It was handled with love and care but I didn't find myself feeling enthralled by anything particular. Don't get me wrong, it's very nicely written. But I wasn't deeply engaged as much as I should have been. It's a shame. I do, however, believe that it's a film that should be seen by everyone, and discussed beyond the award ceremonies. My verdict; The Danish Girl is a piece of art in itself for its wonderful visuals, music and performances by Redmayne and Vikander. If a little more care and attention was applied then this could have been a modern masterpiece. But don't let that turn you away, there's still something deeply planted in this film.'I think Lily's thoughts, I dream her dreams. She was always there.'The Danish Girl, 7/10.",7,10,16,25 January 2016
The Irishman," 'I heard you paint houses.'
","Watched at LFF 2019 Closing Night Gala.Well, those three and a half hours flew by graciously. This is a hefty, meaty film. De Niro, Pacino & Pesci - ALL phenomenal. Pacino especially stole the show for me. What Martin Scorsese accomplishes here is something of a cross between GoodFellas and The Wolf of Wall Street, with sprinklings of the rest of his work throughout.The de-aging (which seems to be the talk at the moment) is pretty solid. Once you adjust your eyes, you forget it's even there. I will say though, the actors are old now, and they clearly don't move like they used to. So it's not so much the 'younger skin' that would be a giveaway, but the way in which the actors move and carry themselves.It is a long film. But not once did I feel like it was outstaying its welcome. The last hour and a half was particularly enjoyable for me - there were some real nice moments between several characters. The script is juicy, with a mix of hilarity, preciseness, and even a little poignancy.It may be the post-film hype talking here, but I think The Irishman is Scorsese's best. It's certainly my favourite piece from him. It feels like a farewell. We'll see how that fares when I rewatch next month on its official release.",10,37,81,15 October 2019
The Hateful Eight," 'Got room for one more?'
","The Hateful Eight is directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern. Some years after the Civil War, in the cold winter of Wyoming, a hangman and his prisoner stumble upon a bounty hunter looking for a ride in their stagecoach. With conversations had and deals made, they head up a way until they bump into a soon-to-be Sheriff. The only thing these folks seem to have in common is their destination: Red Rock. But on their journey they are forced to hold up at a stagecoach stopover cabin called Minnie's Haberdashery until the blizzard calms. As time passes by, the eight folk start to get a little eager to figure out who each of the men really are...Firstly, I was lucky enough to attend a special roadshow event for this movie, and I am glad I spent the (now incredibly reasonable) £20 ticket admission price. The movie was presented in Ultra Panavision 70 and projected on the classic Cinerama single-projector system. There was a musical overture to start, with an intermission after the first act of the movie. We were also given programs as memorabilia. This is a roadshow. And since the 50s-60s, hasn't been done in this fashion. Tarantino was very specific and direct in how he wanted to shoot, and present this movie, and has done so, wonderfully. Special thanks to the staff at ODEON Leicester Square; working the projectors - a seamless run, with no problems.The Hateful Eight is an experiment, of sorts. Tarantino wanted to see what would happen if he threw eight strange and compelling characters together in a small space and see what would happen. This is reminiscent of his first movie, Reservoir Dogs, yet has so much more strength in character background and screenplay that it completely blows it out of the park. He has a drive to get long, beautiful and interesting shots that can last 30 seconds to 1 minute, with no cuts. The opening shot lasts around a minute or two, with the full credits of cast and crew appearing on screen with haunting music by legendary Maestro, Ennio Morricone. When you're watching a Tarantino movie, you're getting an experience that no one else can deliver quite the same way. The acting all around is just outstanding. The 'hateful eight' are incredibly strong characters that interact with each other with so much energy that it would be ridiculous if it were to miss out on Awards season. From Russell and Jackson, to Jason Leigh and Roth; the charisma in both taking everything they've got to portray these characters as Tarantino imagined, and delivering lines, was spot-on. They are genuine, realistic performances.The script is roaring with strength throughout, with quotable lines and humour. This is something that needs to be perfect, or near-perfect in a movie. But with The Hateful Eight, being a dialogue-driven event, it needed to be interesting. Tarantino has worked up a wondrous script with so much life and passion that it completely takes control of the movie and doesn't let up one bit until the credits roll. This is how you make a good western. It has that classic 'who done it' thriller genre nailed down tightly. There hasn't been one like this for a long time, so it's much needed. Music by Ennio Morricone is hauntingly beautiful, making a big return to the western scoring front after 40 years, with original music bleeding through the landscapes and performances by all of the cast. I had listened to the score before seeing the movie and was curious to see how it fitted with the picture, but Morricone being the genius that he is completely changed the way I listen to the score. It fits perfectly with the story. This could be one of the last western scores that he releases, and I believe it's a triumphant return.Visual effects are few and far between but if you're familiar with Tarantino's work then you know there's some violence and gore in there somewhere, which is correct, and it's over the top and extremely bloody. Which I'm a huge fan of, so I was absolutely loving it. There's more I could say but that would eventually mean spoiling and that's something I really try to avoid. My verdict; The Hateful Eight kicks off 2016 in style, with the largest 70mm release in over 20 years. If you have the chance, get to a cinema that's screening the movie in film, it's absolutely worth the price of admission. Quentin Tarantino is still on his filmmaking high and I'm sure will continue this reign of storytelling for years to come. The Hateful Eight, 10/10.",9,16,38,10 January 2016
Moana," 'Exciting visuals, high-spirited characters and a rich soundtrack.'
","Moana is written & directed by Ron Clements, Don Hall, Chris Williams and John Musker and stars Auli'i Cravalho, Dwayne Johnson, Rachel House, Temuera Morrison and Jemaine Clement.In Ancient Polynesia, when a terrible curse incurred by Maui reaches an impetuous Chieftain's daughter's island, she answers the Ocean's call to seek out the demigod and set things right. Walt Disney Animation Studios are famously known for pictures such as Zootopia, Frozen, Wreck-it Ralph, Snow White, The Lion King and many, many more. But, Moana is different. Something about this film really intrigued me - more than just the animation, as usual - and that was the title character, Moana. She's not a princess, and this is stated by the fiery sea voyaging enthusiast, voiced by Auli'i Cravalho, many times during the film. She has a vast amount of abilities and charisma, with a beautiful array of colourful characters to support her in her calling to save the world. I also noticed that, unlike Frozen, the original songs haven't been so incredibly 'out there' during the film's release. This is something that stopped me from seeing Frozen back in 2013 and to this day I still haven't watched it. I didn't like the music I was hearing, but with Moana it's entirely different. I really enjoyed the songs in this film. They have been carefully placed throughout and wonderfully performed by the cast. I must congratulate Auli'i Cravalho on her successful debut and praise her strong vocal range. There's a real cherishable warmth present and it only gives more to the delightful story. Dwayne Johnson is a surprising addition to the list of memorable moments from this film. His character, Maui is hugely energetic, adding a fun and witty shade to the bond between himself and Moana. The supporting cast also did a terrific job of bringing their characters to life, highlighting Rachel House as Grandma Tala. As a big fan of animation and having studied it briefly before, I was excited to see Ancient Polynesia come to life with some of the greatest animators working on the project. With a lot of research and delving into the history of Polynesians, the team have done an extraordinary job of crafting and fine-tuning these characters and environments. The animation is smooth and the visuals vibrant, with some subtle details which most may never notice, but eagle-eyed viewers will love.The original score by Mark Mancina is somewhat disappointing, but only in its overall pay- off. The approach is great, using some of the traditional instruments with the support of Opetaia Foa'i's knowledge in the musical background, but these aren't used nearly as well as they should have been. However, the themes are nicely composed and, as aforementioned, the original songs by Foa'i and Lin-Manuel Miranda are basking in tenderness.Simply put, Moana is a blast. Everyone involved has brought something great to the table and it shines through blissfully. I'd like to see more of this world explored in the future. Not so much in a direct sequel, but with the cultural history and environments so gloriously presented in this film, it would be hard to let go. That said, I've always admired Disney's creativity and diversity. Verdict; Moana utilises a fine blend of exciting visuals, high-spirited characters and a rich soundtrack, becoming one of Disney's finest films yet.Moana, 8/10.",8,2,12,13 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," 'Tom Holland's Spidey is the best yet.'
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier and Zendaya.Peter Parker, with the help of his mentor Tony Stark, tries to balance his life as an ordinary high school student in New York City while fighting crime as his superhero alter ego Spider-Man when a new threat emerges. (12A cert; 133 mins)With this being the third iteration of the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, and the first in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it can be said that the origins are well-known, as is the character. The concept of another reboot was a surprise for many, some liked the idea, others didn't. I was within the latter. That said, with the announcement that Spidey would be joining the MCU, I was curious. Directors Anthony & Joe Russo handled the use of Spider-Man perfectly in Captain America: Civil War. Tom Holland won me over. He became a glowing highlight for me and many others. After that; I was excited to see Spidey in his own movie again.Finally, after a long year of waiting; we have Jon Watts' Spider-Man: Homecoming. Crossing between 'high school romantic comedy' and an action-packed adventure, this telling of Spidey's roots is refreshingly fun, albeit a little messy. Instead of introducing Peter Parker all over again, we're thrown right into his world. Peter is struggling to balance his superhero antics with his high school life, but when he discovers a new threat, he begins to hear a calling.It begins very strongly, setting up the villain and continuing the overarching story from Civil War. But, as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) mentors Peter, his involvement becomes a tedious distraction. I understand that Peter (Tom Holland) is a kid, but I want to see his evolution into the strong asset that he can be. Every time Spider-Man tries to help, Stark is there to bring him back down. I get it, he's being protective. But, this is supposed to be Spidey's movie. I felt it was a little choppy with its storytelling and wasn't quite sure on its comedic placement. There were times when a serious tone was present, which is exactly what is required to help you connect with the characters, but then it pulls you out with a misplaced joke. That said, there were a couple of serious scenes that were played out very convincingly by Holland and Michael Keaton. Especially within the third act, as Stark's presence seemed to have dissolved quite significantly.Apart from a few misguided comedic elements, Spider-Man: Homecoming is highly entertaining. Tom Holland is the best Spidey yet, there's no denying. There's a great balance between his life as a student and his Stark 'internship.' He delivers his lines brilliantly both in and out of the suit. Also, his interactions with Jacob Batalon are perfect, they capture 'nerdy youth' in a nutshell. Then comes Michelle (Zendaya), a sassy student who keeps an eye on Peter and his happenings. She becomes a fun addition to the cast and I hope to see her return in the future.As aforementioned, Keaton delivers his lines very well. The character of Vulture is dark and not be messed with, and this is evident right from the start. There's a clear reason behind his path in life, and it's revealed momentarily. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Happy (Jon Favreau) and Liz (Laura Harrier) all appear in smaller roles, but present a likable charm and a comedic element that works splendidly.The cinematography and editing is smooth and clean, no scenes with jarring issues or a misunderstanding of what's happening on-screen. Everyone in the special and visual effects departments have done a skillful job with the action sequences, it's all very easy to follow and great to look at. Something I was very pleased with was the sound. This film sounds incredible. Any time you see the Vulture coming, you feel the air pulsating and the low frequencies crunching. Truly amazing work by all involved in the sound design.Michael Giacchino's original score is functioning as it should, with memorable motifs and an energetic funk, but as its own listening experience, it can be a little bland. However, it does support the picture as it should, and becomes a fine component to the overall experience.Verdict; Though Stark's involvement can be tedious and the comedy a little misused, Spider-Man: Homecoming is still an enjoyable action-packed thrill ride. Tom Holland's Spidey is the best yet.Spider-Man: Homecoming – ★★★★ (7/10)",8,2,9,11 July 2017
Suicide Squad," One of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.
","Suicide Squad is directed by David Ayer and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Cara Delevingne, Viola Davis, Karen Fukuhara and Jared Leto.Following the events of Batman V Superman, a secret government agency recruits a group of extremely high-profile super-villain prisoners to execute black ops missions in exchange for clemency.First off, this was hugely superior in contrast to Batman V Superman and ultimately worked a hell of a lot better. Margot Robbie is energetic and crazy as Harley Quinn, delivering one of my favourite performances of the movie. Will Smith is awesome as Deadshot, I loved his character. We get to see a little more of his back story than others, and at times I felt I could really side with his decisions. It's great to see Smith back at his best and looking like he's having the time of his life. Hernandez, Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Courtney and Davis were all casted well and gave us realistic performances throughout. Fukuhara takes her first movie role in style with a kick-ass persona and tightly choreographed action sequences. Delevingne was fairly average as Enchantress, often being great and other times not so much. However, she is still new to the acting world, and therefore needs time to settle. Overall, she was a beautiful and interesting character. Jared Leto's take on the Joker is very different to what we've seen before, and one of the most anticipated portrayals this year. Leto settles into the role brilliantly with his bright green hair and broken teeth, giving his unique take on the famous character. Although I enjoyed his scenes, he simply didn't get enough screen time to allow me to fully judge his portrayal. I can't comment on his story or overall characteristics other than the fact that he's a hard thinker and at times unpredictable. I look forward to seeing him in a bigger role, either in Harley's solo movie, or somewhere else in the DC universe. All of these characters have great chemistry with each other and share some genuinely touching moments, most notably Deadshot and Harley Quinn.The visuals are vibrant and eye-popping, especially during the introduction to the characters within the first 20 minutes. Ayer has taken this movie in a direction I wasn't quite expecting, but it was a really cool direction. The writing felt very consistent throughout, and although some of the characters failed to grab my attention, it seemed a lot more grounded than BvS was.The story was handled almost perfectly, I loved that the characters were introduced quickly and there wasn't a reliable origin story to fall back on whenever you needed to feel for a character. There were simply a few scenes tied together that essentially did the same thing an origin would have, but in less time. The pacing is constantly fast and rarely halts for a breath, which is exactly what you need with a movie such as this. The only thing I didn't really like was the main antagonist, which I won't spoil for you, but it felt a little overkill for me. However, with characters such as these facing the threat, it didn't really take away from the entertainment. Steven Price pairs up with Ayer again with another intricate and dramatic score that feeds through the story suitably well. In between this, you have a collection of tracks that are attached to certain key moments, mostly the introductory sequence at the beginning, which feels like it was greatly inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy. There's a moment where 'Spirit in the Sky' is used and this took me out of the experience for a moment, as I'm used to hearing that in Guardians. But apart from that, the soundtrack and score are really nicely weaved into this story and it serves as one of the most memorable things about the movie.Overall, I'm very pleased with how all this turned out. I could wish for more Joker screen time, but that was never majorly promoted, so why dwell on something so little? I think everyone involved has done a wonderful job bringing the world back to life after the disappointing BvS a few months ago.My verdict; Suicide Squad is one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years and David Ayer has delivered a truly unique experience for all to see. Highlighting Will Smith and Margot Robbie's performances, this is an awesome, fun and colourful look into some of the best characters in the DC universe.Suicide Squad, 8/10.",4,1,2,6 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Visually, think Nolan's Inception mixed with Kubrick's 2001, but on a serious acid trip.
","Doctor Strange is written & directed by Scott Derrickson and stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, Michael Stuhlbarg and Benjamin Bratt.A former neurosurgeon embarks on a journey of healing only to be drawn into the world of the mystic arts.Expand Your Mind. This tagline defines the film perfectly. Marvel's Doctor Strange takes us beyond our world and explores the many alternate dimensions, using phenomenal visuals to further expand the Cinematic Universe. In some ways this film feels secluded and disconnected from the MCU, yet it features the familiar wit and style of previous instalments. It's satisfying to experience something so vastly different to what we've seen before with such an incredible array of colour and critique. The history feels real, the set pieces and locations feel real, and most importantly, the characters feel real. This film is so refreshingly short and sweet, allowing for a more immersive experience, without any feeling of painstaking pacing issues. Cumberbatch is surprisingly brilliant as Stephen Strange, a substantial amount of importance is present in his performance. It seems we have another comical addition to the MCU, with Strange being similar to Tony Stark. His humour is sharp and well- timed, but in no way detracting from the dark quality of this film. Tilda Swinton plays a mysterious character named 'The Ancient One' who reveals to Strange the unseen powers beyond our dimension, with wonderful charisma. Wong, as Wong, delivers many humorous opportunities for Strange, and thus becoming a recurring back-and- fourth. Kaecilius isn't developed enough as a character to be judged to a huge extent, however Mikkelsen's performance is satisfactory. McAdams co-stars with a fairly underwhelming act but has some good moments. Hopefully her character will be developed in the future to give McAdams some room to expand on the background and ongoing relationship with Strange.'Expand' seems to be a recurring theme, doesn't it? Leading me to the original score by Michael Giacchino, which is somewhat memorable if only because the main theme is cutting undeniably close to his work on Star Trek. The other pieces are fitting but I felt a more ancient approach could have been taken, in order to branch out the theme of the entire film. However, there are some beautiful string arrangements, which is always the case with Giacchino. I wouldn't expect much more from a Marvel soundtrack, though at least it feels like they're trying to push in a more appealing direction. Speaking of new directions, the visual effects are stunning. This is a visual spectacle, a masterpiece. The MCU has never looked so beautiful, vibrant and alive. With Strange's new metaphysical abilities, we can see the world in a new light. Think Nolan's Inception mixed with Kubrick's 2001, but on a serious acid trip. The Art Direction is impeccable and everyone from the Art, Sound, Special and Visual Effects departments should be extremely proud of their work. This is captured and showcased superbly by Ben Davis, who has worked on some brilliant projects in the past, including James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014.Overall, there are some small improvements to be made, but I have no doubt that these will be developed upon in future instalments. These are barely noticeable, however, and in no way detract from the amount of fun you will have watching this film.Verdict; The story is great, the characters are great, but it's really the visual design and effects featured in Marvel's superior Doctor Strange that puts the icing on the cake.Doctor Strange, 9/10.",9,2,5,30 October 2016
Lion," Emotional, gritty and real. Lion is a must-see.
","Lion is directed by Garth Davis, starring; Dev Patel, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman, David Wenham and introducing Sunny Pawar.A five-year old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometres from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia; 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.It's rare in film to encounter a first act so thoroughly emotional, gritty and real. In Lion, director Garth Davis introduces us to Sunny Pawar, who at only eight-years old gives one of the most genuine, touching performances I've seen from any young actor. The first 50 minutes are mostly silent, similar to the opening act of Pixar's WALLE, in which very little dialogue is used. During this time, Pawar is acting through raw expression as he stumbles around the unforgiving streets of Calcutta, laying down a vital background before cutting to a grown Saroo, 25 years on.The cinematography in this film is simply stunning, capturing India and Australia with a smart eye for composition, complete with a grade that only slightly brushes the screen with a finishing gloss. Each and every shot is dark in tone, especially in the first act, and documents the poverty situation without holding back, making the picture feel that bit more realistic.This is a work based on an incredible true story, and it's definitely one of the most heartfelt tales to ever hit the big screen. During the final act, though inevitable, the execution is thorough enough to make us shed a few tears. The real success here is the telling of Saroo's unexpected journey, miles from home. Once Dev Patel's grown Saroo appears, the impact gets lost somewhere in the background, though in the final act it's rekindled with spirit and we are pulled through many emotions until the picture fades to black. Original music by Dustin O'Halloran & Volker Bertelmann is warm in colour, with a ravishing piano lead that drives the emotional bind between score and imagery. Lush string arrangements are present, but only serve as an underlying texture for the prominent use of piano. The music also stands on its own as a delightful listening experience.This is a must-see. Whether it's at the cinema or during its home release, make it your priority to see this lovely film.Verdict; Garth Davis' Lion is a work of art, featuring a powerful first act that captures fear, wonder and sadness all encased inside one wonderfully raw performance from Sunny Pawar.Lion, 10/10.",10,0,2,2 March 2017
The Revenant," 'I ain't afraid to die anymore. I've done it already.'
","The Revenant is directed by critically acclaimed and 3-time Academy Award winning director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter.Left for dead by members of his hunting team after being mauled by a bear, and betrayed by his confidant John Fitzgerald, Hugh Glass sets off on an incredible path to redemption. Journeying across a vicious landscape and in great turmoil, Glass pushes his body and spirit to breaking-point. With his experience travelling across Europe in his younger years, Iñárritu has acquired a rather large and passionate mindset for visuals and interestingly intricate locations in his filmmaking. With Birdman blowing away movie-goers and critics alike in 2014 with its beautiful camera work and long, steady shots, with superb acting all accompanied by a smart screenplay; Iñárritu had to return with strength. And he has. The Revenant is already gaining major attention from The Academy with 12 Oscar nominations and 3 Golden Globe wins. If that doesn't convince you, take it from me; this is how you make a movie about survival. This is how directors should start shooting action sequences and entire movies all together. Long and smooth shots which never cut unnecessarily, settling you right into the world with no noticeable jogs or jolts that could pull you out. You can see everything that's going on around these characters. I'm sure there are filmmakers that are already taking notes, given the success of both this and Birdman. Not only is this Iñárritu's influence, but cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has the eye for nature, and using what we've been given, to ultimate effect. It's worth noting that everything; every word of dialogue, every scene of violence, every shot of scenery, was shot in natural light. Only once was an exception made, for a campfire scene. Meaning each day of shooting had to be carefully planned ahead of time to make sure that those vital hours of light were used. This is one of many reasons I love Iñárittu's work. Maximum realism, results in an immersive experience.The screenplay is significantly convincing, and although around 40% is spoken in Native American languages, it manages to keep you connected to what's happening on-screen. Iñárittu is one of the writers for this movie, amongst Mark L. Smith and novelist Michael Punke, who wrote the story this movie is loosely based on. I'd like to read the novel and see how this adaption varies from the original story. The acting by all members of the cast were outstanding, but with 2 Academy Award nominations being tied to DiCaprio and Hardy, you'd be wanting to know if they deserve it. My answer; Absolutely. Both are neck and neck with each other throughout the movie, and fall into their characters with extreme intensity. DiCaprio has stated that this was the hardest performance of his entire career. With all the things he had to learn and do to become Hugh Glass I'd say he should definitely take the Oscar. Whether he does or doesn't, will not affect my views. The same for Hardy. Impeccable skill is on show here, by everyone, it would be a shame if it didn't win, but it's already gained huge amounts of attention so that's fine by me.Music by Ryuichi Sakamoto & Carsten Nicolai is fabulously soft and subtle, yet energetic and expeditious when it needs to be. It was used as a part of the overall sound design for the movie, and was added with the natural sounds, not slapped on after, so to speak. This is something I think that filmmakers should also think about doing more often, weaving the music through the visuals without singling out anything until last minute. It really adds to the overall viewing experience, and makes for a pleasant surprise.The visual and special effects were barely noticeable, which isn't a bad thing. They look real, feel real, sound real. The bear scene is brutal. And I mean brutal. If there's one thing I can say about this film, it's that it's brutally violent and gory. Again, not a bad thing. This helps with the realism and nature of this story. There's never a distraction.My verdict; The Revenant is another masterpiece by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and showcases the finest acting, and passion for filmmaking. This is a definite must-see. 'My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands.'The Revenant, 9/10.",9,4,8,16 January 2016
Dunkirk," 'A thrilling, terrifying, edge-of-your-seat experience.'
","Dunkirk is written & directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Jack Lowden, Tom Glynn-Carney, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Harry Styles and Damien Bonnard.Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. (12A cert; 106 mins)To withhold such gravitating tension whilst showing very little of the enemy is a tremendous achievement in suspenseful filmmaking. Christopher Nolan gives us no introduction, no story to back the characters, yet we feel a great sense of terror. To approach the war epic in a completely new and unique way was entirely predictable of Nolan, in no bad sense. We've seen the bloody side of war many times before, so to have a picture that relies less on gore and explicit violence is refreshing. Dunkirk is not your typical war film, this is a story of survival. A terrifying document of Operation Dynamo from three distinct perspectives; Land, Sea and Air.The film opens momentarily with our first lead, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), walking down a desolate backstreet in France as the Germans drop the infamous 'We Surround You' posters overhead. Clutching them, Tommy begins to run to the beaches as Germans open fire. The first shot on the beaches of Dunkirk in glorious IMAX 15/70mm film is beautiful but harrowing. In its huge scale, we see troops lined up, preparing to depart. Then we cut to Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), one of many sailors willing to aid the troops trapped in Dunkirk. Alongside is Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan), two brave young men who voluntarily partake in one of the most heroic missions of all time. Finally, we see pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden) up in the air, flying towards the beaches, picking off enemy aircraft. It's worth noting that these events weren't occurring so closely in time. Many of the troops were trapped on the beaches for a week, the events on the sea happened in a single day, and the spitfires were carrying fuel lasting a mere hour. But in true Nolan style, he brings these historical events into one singular telling, and provides a constant, edge- of-your-seat experience.It's very difficult to pick out any highlights from the incredible cast, because of how truly equal they were, but if I must; Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Fionn Whitehead were the most memorable. They all delivered gripping, relatable performances that really connected with me. That said, everyone else surrounding them were just as compelling. Tom Hardy has some fantastic action sequences, which are captured with remarkable skill, attaching IMAX cameras to the wings of planes, using them as if a GoPro. Harry Styles, in his debut acting role, is presented with some difficult lines to deliver, and performs surprisingly well. He, as any other, is strong and convincing. As aforementioned, I could list every performer and discuss how brilliant they were, but to round it up; Dunkirk has one hell of a cast. They all bring something great to their performances and without any major background, still manage to provide the connection required.Using real naval destroyers, a Spitfire plane and up to 62 ships (many of which were used for Operation Dynamo) – and shooting on IMAX 65mm, standard 65mm and presented on IMAX 15/70mm – Christopher Nolan once again proves he is one of the greatest directors working today. This is his most experimental film, and an engrossing masterpiece at that. Teaming up with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema for their second project following Interstellar in 2014, Dunkirk is a stunning example of how film provides a more vivid, clear and crisp picture compared to digital. If you can, see this on film. It adds a grittiness not present in any digital presentation; I highly recommend the BFI IMAX in London.Amongst all of the wonderful things about Dunkirk, and Nolan's work in general since The Dark Knight Rises, there is always something that I've disliked; the sound mix. This is not to be confused with sound design, which I've always found impressive in his films, and here it's a work of art in itself. But, the levels are sky-rocketing, a loudness in which quality is lost through distortion. It's an ear-piercing experience, perhaps the result they were aiming for, which makes perfect sense, given the events of the film. However, some of Hans Zimmer's score is hidden underneath this layer of force, as well as the small amount of dialogue.Speaking of the score; Zimmer's work has a biting energy throughout, utilising Nolan's own pocket watch ticking as a constant reminder of the enemy nearby. I could wish for more emotional substance, however there's very little time for it, and his rework of Edward Elgar's 'Nimrod' has a charming presence in the third act, an excellent culmination of the score and picture.Dunkirk is huge in scale, but the way in which it's captured presents an up-close and personal documentation of the bravery of the individuals who were trapped on the beaches, the heroes on the sea, and the fighters in the air. This is Christopher Nolan's next masterpiece, and a film that should be viewed in the highest format available to you.Verdict; Dunkirk is without a doubt, one of the most suspenseful films in years. An increasing tension in picture and score that provides a truly thrilling and terrifying experience.Dunkirk – ★★★★★ (9/10)(format watched; IMAX 15/70mm)",9,3,10,24 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Nailed it.
","Captain America: Civil War is directed by Anthony & Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downy Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Brül and last but definitely not least, Tom Holland. After another incident involving destruction, chaos and death, the Avengers are required to sign a contract with a governing body to ensure they are only called upon when absolutely vital. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers become enemies due to a disagreement and the other Avengers are caught in the crossfire. Firstly I'd like to state that I'm not overly keen on how 70% of movies these days are centred around superheroes or their respective universes. I've always enjoyed the instalments Marvel have been releasing in the MCU canon and this is no different... But yet it is.Anthony and Joe Russo so skilfully directed 'The Winter Soldier' that I had no doubts for 'Civil War' and I had a deep feeling it would be perfect. I was right. This is how you direct a superhero movie. Take note Zach Snyder and DC Comics, because this is entertainment.The action sequences are so brilliantly directed and shot that it's impossible to keep your eyes off the screen. It's fast-paced, rapid, clean and smart. If you've seen their work before then you know how beautiful their direction is. And not just in the action sequences; the real conflict and deceit between these heroes is written extremely well and shows you both sides to the story. It's really hard to decide who you side with as a viewer, and that's what is truly wonderful and unique about this movie. It has you rooting for both sides of the argument, regardless of who your favourite characters are.Along with the usual team of Avengers we have some newcomers; Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman did a terrific job as Panther and settles conveniently into the story. I look forward to seeing more of this character in future instalments. Tom Holland as Spidey. Perfect. He has an incredible balance between the web-slinger and teenager Peter Parker. He was introduced into the MCU nicely and was actually involved a lot more than I had expected, which was a great surprise. He handles the comedy with absolute ease and had the entire theatre laughing in all of his scenes. I am stunned and cannot wait to see more of him!Music by Henry Jackman is just as tense and gritty as it was in 'The Winter Soldier' and as the screenplay evolves, the new 'Civil War' theme gravitates to the foreground. Instead of a mash of motifs, Jackman decided that it would be easier to have one overall theme. I appreciate this decision.My verdict; Captain America: Civil War had major potential to be a disappointment. But luckily the Russo brothers came through just as they did before with a complete masterpiece. This is now my favourite MCU instalment by far. Go and see this movie.Captain America: Civil War, 10/10.",9,13,29,30 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Delightful First Instalment in What Looks to be A Fantastic New Franchise.
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is written by J. K. Rowling & directed by David Yates and stars Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler, Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller. The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.'Beasts' takes us back to 1920s New York, where Newt Scamander is briefly stopping over at the end of his global excursion to find and document extraordinary magical creatures. Although seeming simply unnecessary, J. K. Rowling has brought something completely new and original to the table. 'Beasts' surprised me in the best of ways, with a beautiful story and vibrant characters that never fail to amuse and entertain. Though, amongst the bright visual design and humble characteristics, there is a darkness lurking in the background. This becomes largely important as the film progresses, and ends with a climatic finale sequence that adds a new spark of life to the beloved 'Potter' franchise. The leading mains have been written perfectly by Rowling and deliver stellar performances that feel grounded and relatable, especially Redmayne's Newt and Fogler's Kowalski. Alongside these are the leading ladies, Waterson and Sudol, who are also brilliantly radiant throughout. Ezra Miller is outstanding as Credence Barebone, bringing an emotional core to his character and exploring new sides of his acting abilities. Colin Farrell is satisfyingly suitable in his portrayal of Graves, who hides a mysterious secret that will keep you guessing until the final moments. These new characters are so vastly different to those in the 'Potter' films, but share the same charisma and excitement all the same. I'm looking very much forward to seeing where these characters head next, and how they could interact with different surroundings (possibly Hogwarts?) in future instalments, which I'm glad to say I'm extremely excited for.The original score by James Newton Howard is refreshingly splendid, with layers upon layers of intricate detail to carry the story along gently while leaving space for a loitering, ruinous tension in the air. There are subtle nods to the original motifs from Williams' but these are always appropriately used as a way to bridge the gap between 'Beasts' and 'Potter.'At times the visual and special effects feel almost unloved, most notably the interactions between Newt and Thunderbird, lacking the impeccable finish that the other creatures have. However, 95% of the film looks absolutely amazing and the cast provide great chemistry towards these strange but likable beasts. The finale looks stunning and proves that there's so much more to be explored visually throughout this new franchise. Huge props to everyone involved in the Art, Set and Costume departments, bringing a sense of authenticity to the film, along with the Sound department resonating an articulate and natural bed of sound. Also, the set design is remarkably realistic and provides a lush backdrop for our characters.Director David Yates is familiar with the world of 'Potter' having helmed the final films in the series, so it's expected that he presents us with another glorious feature and in doing so, kickstarting an optimistic set of films. Verdict; 'Beasts' is a wonderful tale and in no way replicates what we've already seen before, delivering a fun, fast-paced and delightfully entertaining first instalment to what looks to be a Fantastic and promising new franchise.

Room," Triumphant filmmaking
","Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, Garage) and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen & William H. Macy. Based on the best-selling novel; Room explores how 5-year-old Jack copes with the huge world surrounding him after escaping the 10-by-10 foot enclosure that kept he and his mother captive his entire life. With tour de force performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, this psychological drama triumphs in a story of survival, hope and the unbinding love between mother and son. With award season in full swing, Room has captured audiences around the world, with its small and subtle storytelling and gargantuan directorial vision. The attention this film has gained is so vast and wonderful to see, focusing on the performances of our two on-screen protagonists. I'm truly glad to see Larson taking the Oscar for best actress and Tremblay for the AFCA breakthrough artist. Both are equally magnificent as their chemistry flows beautifully throughout the 128 minute running-length of the film.After seeing Abrahamson's directional efforts in 'Frank' and hearing that he was sitting back in the directors chair for Room, I knew I had to see it. His work is highly regarded as some of the best Irish cinema around. I can safely say, I agree. Truly enduring work, and the pacing never holds up even for a few moments.Stephen Rennicks pairs up with Abrahamson yet again with their fifth collaboration and it sounds incredible. The soft guitar melodies play slowly and gently under the performances and perfectly portray the mood and themes of this film, then as the drama and tension increases, a structured string movement thickens the emotional core. I'd love to see the two connecting again sometime in the future. I have very little to say that would be derivative of the overall feature and because of this, I have to say I'm very happy with the experience I have had with this film. I think Abrahamson is an ingenious director and really strives to be different.My verdict; Room is a film that everyone should watch and take note of. A simple idea can go a long way. This is substantial proof of that. Room, 9/10.",9,1,5,29 February 2016
Schindler's List," A truly terrifying picture.
","Schindler's List is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz.In German-occupied Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazi Germans.Steven Spielberg's horrifically harrowing Schindler's List isn't just a critically acclaimed, award-winning masterpiece. This is a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: 'I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more.'Liam Neeson showcases a raw talent as Schindler, performing skilfully throughout. Every line is delivered with absolute care and feels entirely realistic. His interactions with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) are some of the greater scenes in the film, most specifically the creation of the list. Kingsley has always proved himself an incredible supporting act. Ralph Fiennes also plays alongside Neeson as Amon Goeth, a ruthless and negligent SS captain who murders for sport. Eventually, Goeth is told that power is in fact to never kill, but pardon a man. It never truly connects with him, but continues his work with it in mind. This is one of Fiennes' greatest, most pre-eminent performances to date.The decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve, and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution.John Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. 'Jewish Town' continues that same feeling, but explores Williams & Perlman's impeccable talent further. This is a fine example of the perfect film score.Verdict; It may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all.Schindler's List – ★★★★ (8/10)",8,16,25,9 May 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," 'A fun, visually incredible, swashbuckling adventure and worthy sequel.'
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (originally & more fittingly; Dead Men Tell No Tales) is directed by Joachim Rønning & Espen Sandberg and stars Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario, Kevin McNally, David Wenham.Captain Jack Sparrow searches for the trident of Poseidon. (12A cert; 129 mins)It's been 14 years since we first met Jack Sparrow on the big-screen. Johnny Depp handed in a truly unique and intricate performance that earned him a nomination for Best Actor at The Academy. The first film was a genuine surprise for everyone, followed up graciously with two fantastically fun sequels shot back-to-back. 6 years ago, a stand-alone sequel (On Stranger Tides) was released, with it came a disappointing response. Jack Sparrow's solo outing was still mostly enjoyable, but the magic of the first three instalments was lost, largely due to the absence of the original cast. After years of waiting, we are able to return to the world of Pirates.Does Rønning & Sandberg's Salazar's Revenge live up to the original? The answer: No. However, I felt the exact same feelings that I did with the first when watching this fresh instalment. It's fun, colourful, action-packed, visually incredible – clearly a very expensive production overall – and it features some particularly likable characters.As soon as the screen opens we are introduced to Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), who seeks help from Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his father (Orlando Bloom) from a terrible curse. However, due to previous events in Jack's past, the ghostly Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) longs for bloody revenge and will not stop until Sparrow is no more.There's no doubt about Depp's performance as the witty Captain Jack Sparrow being truly brilliant. Although it's clear that some of the charm we loved so much in the first few films has been degrading over time. It's no different in Salazar's Revenge, Depp looks to be enjoying every moment, but something feels 'off' in his delivery. Of course, he still manages to lift the film to extraordinary heights and he still performs wonderfully in some of the funniest scenes (the guillotine, anyone?) but you can't ignore the strange evolution of his lovable character.Bashing heads with Depp is Javier Bardem who turns in a dark and scary performance as Salazar, quickly becoming one of my favourite Pirates villains. Watching his scenes unfold and seeing his enthusiasm for the role is a real treat. On the 'good side' is Thwaites & Scodelario, fighting the ghost army as they journey to their destination. Two genuine and pleasant performances, somehow filling the missing pieces that Will & Elizabeth leave behind. Some of the original crew of the Black Pearl return, including Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and Marty (Martin Klebba) proving to be a key part of the franchise and a terrible loss if underused. Here, they provide a comical back-and-forth between Jack, Carina and Henry and continue to make the audience chuckle. Finally, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is back and he's as great as ever. The character has seen some 'spotty' times but Rush's passion for Pirates is unbroken.After four instalments featuring the music of Hans Zimmer (including The Curse of the Black Pearl which Zimmer overproduced), Geoff Zanelli takes the reins with a powerful and engaging original score. Not only does Zanelli revive several main themes throughout (and rightfully so, having worked with Zimmer on previous occasions), he writes with clear knowledge of the characters and produces an exciting and thrilling listening experience.Although the story isn't the strongest and the many situations are somewhat unrealistic and exaggerated, it's still a heavily energetic production. Everything from the clean editing and glistening visual effects to the stunning make-up and beautiful Australian locations is simply amazing. Fans longing for something close to the original trilogy should have a lot of fun watching this film.Verdict; Salazar's Revenge (Dead Men Tell No Tales) may not be as smart or as charming as the original, but it's pure swashbuckling entertainment for the fans. Familiar faces return as new faces are introduced, and Captain Jack Sparrow continues to command with a bottle of rum in hand.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge – ★★★★ (8/10)",8,1,6,29 May 2017
Ex Machina," A powerful directional debut.
","Ex Machina is written and directed by Alex Garland and stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. Caleb, a young programmer, is selected by an internet millionaire to participate in a ground-breaking experiment evaluating the human qualities of a new AI. Garland's directional debut is a stunning, tense, thought-provoking masterpiece. Set in the not-too-distant future, we look as Caleb and the beautiful humanoid Ava interact through 7 sessions set in an extremely claustrophobic surrounding. We've seen movies take on this kind of storytelling before, but in no way like this. The visuals are simply amazing. The movie is set against the backdrop of Norway, which allows our characters to feel cut-off from the rest of the world.The story develops trippingly and the interactions reel you in effortlessly as Vikander and Gleeson perform to such a believable extent that you are absolutely glued to the screen. Vikander is an extremely talented actress who has already kick-started a healthy career and this just adds to her success. Stripping right back to subtle movements and performing almost entirely through her eyes, she conveys a whole set of emotions which only makes her instantly convincing as a humanoid AI, seducing you into an unpredictable performance. Oscar Isaac is great as mysterious millionaire, Nathan, who owns a major internet search engine business. Hiding behind a beard, he brings an ultimately sparse yet tense portrayal to the character and keeps you guessing about the reasons for this experiment.The visual effects are few yet vast in detail, but almost unnoticeable when on-screen. The majority of the effects are in the creation of Ava, and showcases a version of Vikander we have never before seen. It's great to see the visual effects department getting a lot of appreciation, taking home a well deserved Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. Original music by Geoff Barrow & Ben Salisbury is heart-pumping and gritty. It feels very industrial and weaves in electronic effects to create an ambiance of suspense throughout the movie. A lot of the more intricate cues are placed in the final act of the story and work perfectly with the performances.I'd also like to say some words of appreciation about the cinematography by Rob Hardy, which is just fantastic. Something I always look for when watching a movie is the visuals and how a director works with the cinematographer to construct beautiful and superior shots that work as binary, aiding the story and performances. Hardy has done this perfectly and I believe that he has the potential to be very successful with many awards under his belt in the near future.Don't be fooled by its somewhat simple plot, it will surprise you in the best of ways. Garland is of course known for his written work, but his direction is eccentric and needs to be seen. My verdict; Ex Machina is a fast-paced, terrifying, beautiful, subtle and complex take on the sci-fi genre and will leave you wanting more. This is something to be experienced by everyone. Ex Machina, 10/10.",10,1,4,26 May 2016
Hidden Figures," Both serious and fun, Theodore Melfi's feel-good drama is a blast.
","Hidden Figures is written & directed by Theodore Melfi and stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali.The story of a team of African-American women mathematicians who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the US space program.In Theodore Melfi's Hidden Figures, three heroic women who were a vital part of NASAs early years, are strongly portrayed by three wonderful actresses; Tarija P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, thankfully bringing the remarkable true story into the limelight.A smart, refreshing script is blissfully aided by cinematographer Mandy Walker's 'Kodachrome' direction, capturing each scene with two distinct tones; warm and cold. Though a simple story, it's told with care and although slightly dramatised, it's hugely investing. Henson, Spencer and Monáe are all perfect performers, becoming very likable mere minutes into the picture. Henson takes the lead, however, with a showcase of pure strength and drive.The 1950s/60s are always interesting to see brought to the big screen, especially in the costume and production design. Both departments have delivered in every sense, alongside the art director and set decorator to achieve the utmost detail, in doing so, creating a working environment the actors can connect with and the audience can adhere to.If I had to say anything I disliked about Hidden Figures, it would be the decision to cast Dunst and Parsons. The two felt inapposite and while both gave satisfying performances, I never once clicked with their characters. Costner executed his character with skill and ease, yet the two aforementioned lacked any unique traits in their rather substantial roles. The original soundtrack by Pharrell Williams is overflowing with energy, featuring tracks written specifically for the picture, including feel-good cues composed by Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch. Each track feels largely appropriate not only for the imagery but for the time period, also.There's a lot to like in Hidden Figures, and for all of the right reasons it ticks all of the right boxes. Verdict; Vibrant characters, stylish writing and a funky soundtrack ignite a flourishing work of brilliance in Theodore Melfi's historical drama.Hidden Figures, 9/10.",9,1,8,1 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The most divisive Star Wars film yet.
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi is written & directed by Rian Johnson and stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Kelly Marie Tran, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Gwendoline Christie, Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro.Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile, the Resistance prepares to do battle with the First Order. (12A cert; 152 mins)This is a film that will make or break Star Wars for fans across the globe. It's surprising. It's divisive. It's already proving to be a difficult one for viewers to digest. There's a lot of pieces moving in Johnson's striking instalment, and I'm going to discuss my thoughts with slightly more personality than usual - without spoilers, of course. The best way to break down this film is to split it into sections, discussing the thematic material featured in The Last Jedi. Let's begin.The main theme here, and this is spoken verbally by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in the film, is all about forgetting the past. As Kylo says; 'Kill it, if you have to.' This theme is planted right away and it reappears constantly throughout. Luke (Mark Hamill) resides on Ahch-To, and has completely shut himself off from everything. He's trying to kill the past. We focus on Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she tries to uncover the truth about her true parentage, this is her confronting and killing her past. In order to move forward, all of our characters have to learn to let go. For obvious reasons, I can't say much beyond that, but I believe this is the reason some people are confused. I'll admit, I wasn't sure how to feel walking out of the theatre, and it was an entirely different experience than with The Force Awakens back in 2015. This is a new theme; we've never really seen it in any Star Wars film before, and I really respect Rian Johnson for going in a new direction.There are some moments I really disliked, however. Firstly; the editing starts to feel a little tedious. There are so many things happening in this film, so it tries to jump back and forth in order to create a smooth viewing experience but actually what it does is pull you out entirely. I disliked everything Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) did in Canto Bight. I wanted to see what was happening with Luke and Rey, even Kylo, but every time I started to feel comfortable it pulled back to the casino city. Secondly, the surrounding plot with the Resistance running from the First Order was lacklustre. But, I've thought about it some more and it really acts as a shell. Inside that shell is some of the best character development I've seen. The Last Jedi isn't about the spaceship chase, its about the characters. Everyone in this film evolves in some way, shape or form. By the end, they are all in a complete different position on the playing board from where they were in The Force Awakens. Take out Canto Bight and I think the film already flows a lot smoother. Beyond that, there are still some remaining issues, but those wander into spoiler territory.In terms of characters, Kylo Ren was by far my favourite in The Last Jedi. Driver gives an incredible performance and Johnson expands on his story, detailing his upbringing and the reasons for his shattered mind. He's far more complex now and will continue to evolve heading into Episode IX. Ridley returns with another strong act and never fails to inspire. She's fun and engaging, I'm glad she's part of this trilogy. The late Carrie Fisher has some beautiful scenes and the film itself acts as a nice tribute to the character of Leia, despite one moment that was utter garbage. Boyega and Tran share some great screen time together and though I felt it was shoehorned in, I'm interested to see where their characters head next.The second theme is love. This is harder to explain without spoilers, but Luke makes a really great statement in the film that stuck with me, and the characters. Maybe fighting isn't the solution. Saving what you love is. Mark Hamill's performance is one of the best in the film, and possibly the saga. Sometimes the writing gets a little shaky and some of the dialogue and decisions he makes are out of character. But there are two scenes that really felt like Luke was in there. I think most would know the scenes I mean.Finally, the theme of hope returns. The finale builds up to something much larger than one more film; it feels as though there are going to be more and more. I didn't like the positioning of this, and I believe it was something that could have been left out until Episode IX, but it does make room for some interesting theories. It didn't leave me filled with the level of excitement I had with The Force Awakens, though. Truthfully, there really wasn't any.I do think The Last Jedi is a good film, but I think it'll become greater with time. It was enjoyable, and it had some truly brilliant moments. But the pacing was clunky and some of the story threads drifted a little far from the core narrative. The special effects as usual were splendid and the sound design is insane. The original score by John Williams was fun, a little sparse and lacking new memorable themes but there are some very nice sections. Rose and Finn's theme is a highlight. His score supported the film well, and that's what he does best.Verdict; Though Johnson's ideas are clear, the way in which they're tackled is slightly underwhelming. The Last Jedi suffers from pacing issues and poor comedic timing but beneath that is something huge. Performances all around are striking, including that of the late Carrie Fisher. This is the most divisive Star Wars film yet.Star Wars: The Last Jedi, 7/10.",9,0,2,18 December 2017
La La Land," A love letter to Classic Hollywood.
","La La Land is written & directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Rosemarie DeWitt and J. K. Simmons.A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles.Who said Hollywood's Golden Age died back in the 1960s? In Damien Chazelle's remarkable La La Land, it's back in full force with all the glitz, glamour and fun energy that made the classics so enjoyable. Our two wonderful leads; Ryan Gosling (Sebastian) and Emma Stone (Mia) are an absolute treat to watch as they pursue their dreams, taking us through the colourful city of Los Angeles around them. Presented gloriously in CinemaScope and featuring a stellar soundtrack, La La Land is a triumph in filmmaking only to be experienced in cinemas. The technical skill on show is undeniably careful and gracious, acting as the perfect supplement to the aforementioned leads.As the screen opens and the CinemaScope logo appears, we pan down from the pale blue sky over the city and straight into the first musical number, which may need some time to settle but nevertheless kickstarts the film with joy. At first glance you'll notice and appreciate the presence of a soft and subtle film grain, created only when shot on celluloid. Natural lighting is used for most scenes in the film, as well as real locations all over the city of Los Angeles, securing a sense of realism in the story and characters.Once the rocky first quarter comes to an end, the real magic begins. With some fine trimming, La La Land could be a perfect masterpiece, but the duration of the film (or rather, the time management) is my only complaint. Chazelle's writing is spectacular and reminiscent of his previous project, Whiplash, which also saw major success and received high approval from critics and filmgoers alike. A small cameo from J. K. Simmons branches the gap between this film and Chazelle's last, with Simmons playing a similar character to that in Whiplash. The soundtrack composed by Justin Hurwitz is pumping with life, carrying on his funky jazz style, accompanied by Stone and Gosling's strong vocals. The numbers are entertaining and skilfully performed, with vivid visuals to aid the original score, also composed by Hurwitz.In preparing for their roles, Stone and Gosling were required to learn to dance and move to specific cues during the lengthy one-shot takes. Gosling also decided to learn the piano in order to dismiss the need for CGI doubling, further showcasing his talents as we watch in admiration. La La Land is a work of art, a true love letter to Hollywood's Golden Age. Although taking place in the modern world, with smartphones and social network tools, Chazelle takes a unique approach and combines old and new. There are vibrant sets and exciting sequences that seem as if they've been pulled directly from the 50s/60s alongside modern vehicles and coffee shops, providing a marvellous backdrop for our characters to interact with. Each and every individual involved in this project have done a remarkable job in creating a world everyone can get happily lost in. Awards season is underway and La La Land has already made Golden Globes history with its impressive 7 wins, further attracting filmgoers and selling out show after show around the world. This is simply fine work and all involved should be greatly proud of this superb accomplishment.Here's to the ones who dream.Verdict; Lights, camera, action! Classic Hollywood is back with Damien Chazelle's hugely entertaining and dazzling La La Land.La La Land, 8/10.",8,2,8,17 January 2017
Sicario," One of the best thrillers this decade.
","Sicario is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies), and stars Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro. A task force enlists FBI agent, Kate Macer (Blunt), to eradicate a cartel operation responsible for a bomb that had killed members of her team. What follows is a twist of events that lead to a mysterious character called Alejandro (Del Toro). He is described as 'sicario' which is Spanish for 'hit-man'.It's worth noting that this film is no action flick. Nor should you think so. Villeneuve is a director who uses a perfect blend of story and imagery, never letting the viewer lose grasp of what's happening on screen. If you've seen previous films of his, you know what you're getting into. The directing is incredibly good and well-paced. The visuals are stunning.The cast shines throughout each of their performances, with the highlights of Blunt and Del Toro. There were also a few nice surprises from Jon Bernthal and Daniel Kaluuya, who also gave great performances.The score by Jóhan Jóhannsson is tense, gritty and dark. It really helps pull the picture together. Everything you see on screen is portrayed beautifully in the music, using a nice array of instruments and sound design to keep you on the edge of your seat. The writing felt realistic and aided the actors with depth to their characters. If the script was bad then the film simply wouldn't be as great as it is. That's the standard for any film.Sicario is a must-see for fans of high-octane thrillers and gruesome story-telling. If you're looking for an action packed flick, this is not the film for you. Denis Villeneuve returns after his 2 year feature-absence with true style and this proves that he is now one of the most talented and masterfully intelligent directors around. Go and see this film.Sicario: 9/10.",9,0,3,12 October 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians Vol. 2 continues Gunn's energetic, fun & emotional formula.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written & directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Pom Klementieff, Michael Rooker, Sean Gunn and Kurt Russell. Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage.Where to start? After the huge success of Gunn's first instalment in the trilogy and the incredible praise it received, Guardians Vol. 2 had expectations set pretty high. The story was written beautifully and each character felt important. It was hilarious & action-packed but still left room for one of the most vital ingredients in any film; emotion. When the first film cut to black, the fans felt like they'd experienced something truly unique. It made us happy, sad, filled with adrenaline. Gunn had us hooked on these feelings. The bar was set.Which is why I'm so happy that Guardians Vol. 2 hits every single one of those notes once again. There's a surprise ingredient in this instalment, however, and you'll know it when you see it. Let's start with the characters. 'The 5' are back. It pretty much picks up from where the first film left off, but our characters have evolved significantly and it's evident from the first 10 minutes; which is one of the most incredibly fun sequel openers I've ever seen (again, you'll understand when you see it). Peter Quill / Star-Lord, played effortlessly by Chris Pratt has some of the funniest lines, but also hits the emotional core splendidly. Bautista's Drax is one of the most amusing characters in the line-up. He delivers each line with great comedic timing and had the theatre laughing from line to line. Rocket is brilliant, Bradley Cooper is casting at its best. Gamora and Nebula are given some more development, we hear about their past and even at times feel a little sympathy for Nebula. Both Saldana and Gillan play their respective roles with strength. Even Baby Groot has some chances to shine, which is awesome.There's a new addition with Klementieff's Mantis, providing a nice back-and-fourth between herself and Drax. Stallone's casting didn't work with me, it's one of the very minor things I disliked about the film, however we never get a chance to explore his character. Michael Rooker returns as Yondu and he is a badass with so many crazy scenes, a truly superb performance. Alongside Rooker is Sean Gunn, brother of James, returning as Kraglin. He has some really cool moments and definitely develops more as a character towards the end of this film. Finally, Kurt Russell. Yes, it's no spoiler that he plays the father of Quill. In fact, it would be impossible to avoid. That's why the 'reveal' is in the trailers. Gunn personally chose to have that scene included. There's so much more to Kurt's character, which I will not discuss here. Though a little exaggerated, Kurt is great.Moving the focus towards something that most of the time goes unnoticed, or at least under-appreciated, is the costume design. Judianna Makovsky pays close attention to detail and everything looks beautiful. These films wouldn't be as brilliantly convincing as they are without her. The same goes for the cinematography, editing, visual effects, make-up, production design, art decoration, set decoration, stunts, sound department, and of course, the music.As an exception, I had listened to the entire score by Tyler Bates before seeing the film. I think it worked out better this way; I had a vision in my mind of how these themes were going to be used, but then hearing them within the context of the film really surprised me. Tyler has created a wonderful score that, with Gunn's love and appreciation for his work, has been utilised perfectly. There's some Williams-esque writing in the percussion during the opening battle, creating a fierce introduction which then progresses into a psychological examination of our leads, most notably Peter Quill. Not only is it an enjoyable listen compositionally, it's as vitally important as the characters.One of many fans' favourite 'characters' from the first Guardians was the Awesome Mix, gifted to Quill by his mother. In the final act of the first film, Quill opens a second gift with another tape inside, Awesome Mix Vol. 2. This continues to complement the picture wonderfully from start to finish. Personal favourites are Electric Light Orchestra's 'Mr. Blue Sky' & Fleetwood Mac's 'The Chain,' but a perfect use of Cat Stevens' 'Father And Son' may just cap it off.Finally, Gunn's writing feels as grounded and as human as it did before. He writes humour very well, but also provides intricate detail within characters that move the viewers. It creeps up on you and it's tremendously touching. Not only that, but Guardians Vol. 2, like the first, never once feels as if it's just setting up the next big thing. Although taking place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it sticks with our characters and only very minor nods to the MCU are used, creating its own 'Cosmic Universe' which breathes a lot of fresh air into the genre.I could go on and on, but that would ruin the experience. This film showcases some serious talent, in front of the camera and behind the scenes. Support these incredible individuals by heading to your nearest cinema and seeing this film. If you enjoyed the first Guardians, you're gonna love this. I think it's better on almost all levels.Verdict; Action-packed, hilarious and an emotional ride. Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 – ★★★★★ (9/10)",9,5,11,29 April 2017
The Disaster Artist," Franco disappears into his greatest performance as the mysterious Tommy Wiseau.
","The Disaster Artist is directed by James Franco and stars Dave Franco, James Franco, Seth Rogen, Paul Scheer, Alison Brie, Ari Graynor, Josh Hutcherson and Jacki Weaver.When Greg Sestero, an aspiring film actor, meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true. (15 cert; 103 mins)Over a decade ago, something truly remarkable happened. The Room, one of the best worst movies ever, was released in a single theatre for two weeks. Not surprisingly, the reason The Room lasted two weeks in that theatre was because a 'young' man; Tommy Wiseau, paid the theatre to keep it running. Surprisingly, his disasterpiece became a sensation and has garnered a huge cult status over the years. A few years ago, Greg Sestero (who played Mark in The Room) published a book - 'The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made' - documenting his life and eventual meeting with Tommy, interweaved with stories from the set. Now that book has been adapted into, as Tommy would say, real Hollywood movie; The Disaster Artist.Having watched The Room and reading the book about its creation, I was incredibly excited to hear the news of a film being made, focusing on the relationship between the two friends. What sucked was when I realised I'd be travelling 12 miles out to see this film. Unfortunately, the UK has had a lack of screenings for The Disaster Artist, but I just had to see it, so I made the effort. It was worth it. The guys working on this film all have a great amount of respect for Tommy and his unstoppable drive to make it in Hollywood, and it shows. James Franco directs with subtlety and finesse but it's his portrayal of Tommy that struck a chord with me. He completely disappears into his performance, delivering an unforgettable act that absolutely nails the personality and sells the affect Tommy had on people. Dave Franco provides a likeable lead as Greg, who has the same dream as Tommy; to be a Hollywood star. Having two real-life brothers play two best friends was a great choice. The Franco's have a brotherly bond that excels further on-screen and they both make The Disaster Artist a believable (as unbelievable as it is) and compelling drama.The film really focuses on the two aforementioned, but the surrounding cast is just as brilliant. Seth Rogen, Paul Scheer, Alison Brie, Josh Hutcherson, Ari Graynor, Jacki Weaver and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention are important to the story and bring greatness to the set within the set. The same goes for the crew who have worked incredibly hard to tell this story right. To respect these talented folk properly, stay through the credits because there are some insanely good side-by-side scene recreations. It wouldn't surprise me if they shot these on both digital and 35mm like Tommy did with The Room, that's how painfully accurate they are.Dave Porter's original score is surprisingly very present in the film, which for comedies is somewhat unheard of. Due to its dramatic nature, though, The Disaster Artist required something a little more memorable. Porter presents an inspiring and uplifting score that captures the tone perfectly right up into the credits.In terms of story, The Disaster Artist is fairly faithful to the source material. There are some moments overlooked, such as Tommy's awful behaviour and attitude on-set (though they do show some of this briefly), his suicidal period leading to his disappearance, and even the original casting of Mark. I was somewhat disappointed but then I realised what I was watching was real enough that it didn't subtract from any of my enjoyment. Greg's intricate explanation and description of these events are definitely worth reading, though, so I recommend buying his book right away. What I did like about this film was how Franco decides to add emphasis to Tommy's dream and create a sort of likeable charm that pays off during the premiere/auditorium scene in the final act. It was one of the best moments in the film and it really hits you. The Room is Tommy's baby. It's his life. I liked Franco's direction to respect that.Verdict; Though respectful, Franco isn't afraid to show the darkness looming over Tommy Wiseau, as he disappears into his greatest performance yet. This may well be one of the best biopics I've seen; a truly remarkable story.The Disaster Artist, 8/10.",8,0,1,12 December 2017
Steve Jobs," 'I'm gonna put music in your pocket.'
","Steve Jobs is directed by Danny Boyle (The Beach, Slumdog Millionaire) and stars an incredible ensemble cast; Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen & Jeff Daniels.This isn't a biopic. This is an insight of what happened backstage at three distinct product launches from the Macintosh, 1984, through to the iMac launch in 1998. This is a look at the passionate, ego-driven genius, Steve Jobs. It's a beautiful, dialogue-driven story with some of the best screenplay I've seen in film for a very long time. Aaron Sorkin is the man to thank for such a remarkable and engaging script. If you've seen The Social Network, you already know of his talent, and you'll be very happy to see that he has delivered yet again. Danny Boyle's directing is captivating and fast-paced. Although this is a dialogue-driven movie, it never lets up. You will fail to draw your eyes away from the screen, even for a second to blink. I love this movie because it isn't afraid to show some of Jobs' dark side. He had to make sacrificial choices to revolutionise modern technology forever. This movie is totally incomparable to Joshua Michael Stern's 'Jobs (2013)'. This isn't telling his story from point A to point B, this is telling the story of a man fighting his inner struggles at some of the most iconic product launches ever. It's genius.Music by Daniel Pemberton worked really well with the screenplay and the film's evolution. As you may know, this film was shot in 3 ways to illustrate the advancement in technology during these launches. The first act was shot in 16mm, act 2 in 35mm, and act 3 in digital. The music plays along with this as the story moves forward. Starting with simple pulsing sounds, moving on to simple melody involvement and finally by the third act, a full string arrangement with a completed structure. It's also worth mentioning that this is a score you'll want to purchase after seeing the film, it's beautiful. The acting by Fassbender is astounding. He's had his fair share of moments in his career but this is one of his best pieces of work. Seth Rogen was brilliant as Apple co-founder and friend, Steve Wozniak. I was very surprised to see him really getting into his role and selling the character. I didn't look at him as Seth Rogen, the funny guy. I looked at him at Steve Wozniak. Jeff Daniels has been on the big screen once before this year with 'The Martian' and he brings some great moments with him. Kate Winslet, of course, was wonderful also. This cast just clicked. It's half of what made this story so watchable. Well done to the casting department. My verdict; Steve Jobs delivers some of the greatest moments that I've seen in film for years. It's safe to say this is definitely a highlight of Boyle's work so far. Give this movie some money and see it at cinemas. If you can't manage that, get it when it releases on formats such as Blu-Ray. It's worth it.Steve Jobs, 10/10.",10,0,4,14 November 2015
Sausage Party," Truly shocking in the best of ways.
","Sausage Party is directed by Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernon and stars Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Michael Cera, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd & Edward Norton.A sausage strives to discover the truth about his existence.Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are one of the best duos in comedy filmmaking. Their humour is focused heavily on gross-out situations, over-the-top performances and somewhat relatable characters. Having watched their movies - Superbad, Pineapple Express & This Is The End, for example - many times, I knew I had to see this. I was not disappointed. Sausage Party features all of the crazy stuff you'd come to expect from the duo, yet packing in moments that will genuinely surprise you.The writing is ridiculously fun, fast-paced and outrageous. I think partly what makes it so much more enjoyable is the animation. It's supposed to look and feel like a children's movie, but you couldn't be more wrong. With the ecstatic performances from all the cast throughout, it delivers for the most part. Though a majority of the jokes are brilliant, there were moments were it seemed unimaginative, almost bland in taste. That said, seconds later another character will jump in to save the scene. So although it's not completely fluent in translation, it's a fairly decent comedy flick.Music by Christopher Lennertz & Alan Menken is pretty average, though you couldn't ask for more with such a movie. The opening song/theme is tightly written and composed, introducing you to the world our characters live in very nicely. Overall, an unnoticeable addition to the feature, but by no means a bad one. Lennertz is actually one of the best composers in the comedy genre, so whoever was in control and made that decision did a good job.Highlighting Seth, Kristen and Jonah for their seemingly 'off-the-cuff' portrayals, absolutely stealing the show and bringing the laughs. From the beginning to end, these characters truly shocking in the best of ways. I advise against watching the trailers, as a few of the better scenes are featured, however this won't completely ruin the surprise. There's still a lot of crazy, disgusting, vulgar writing by Seth, Evan and Jonah that must be experienced. I use those descriptive words in the 'pre-eminent' sense.This movie definitely isn't for everyone, but fans of Rogen & Goldberg will almost certainly approve.Verdict; Sausage Party is an extremely unique take on the comedy genre and while sometimes the humour may lack, the story, somewhat ostentatious animation and shocking pay-off will leave you with some confusing afterthoughts whilst grinning.Sausage Party, 7/10.",7,2,4,19 September 2016
Whiplash," An inspiring, energetic, engaging masterpiece.
","Whiplash is written & directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, Melissa Benoist, Paul Reiser, Austin Stowell, Nate Lang and Chris Mulkey.A promising young drummer enrols at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realise a student's potential.Whiplash is simply outstanding. Beautiful cinematography, incredible lead performances and an energetic soundtrack. If there were ever such a thing as a perfect film, it would be like this. It's been just over a year since I first watched Chazelle's impeccable Whiplash, and since then I have re-watched and studied it many times. As a composer, and a fan of jazz music, I may be a little biased. However, with such critical acclaim, I can't be the only one raving about this film.Miles Teller leads as the promising young drummer, Andrew Neimann, who dreams of becoming one of the greats. Teller showcases an ensemble of emotions, and without a doubt delivers his best performance yet. He decided to learn the drums (again) and play all of the pieces you see performed in the film, live, just to be that little more convincing. No doubles, no camera tricks, it's really him playing. Of course, to make the music consistent with the cuts, and to be of high quality, they dubbed his already recorded takes over his (very real) playing. Teller now stands as one of my favourite actors, from just this role alone. J. K. Simmons is delightfully dislikable as Fletcher, pushing Andrew to the absolute edge and eventually corrupting his mind and changing his life forever. The writing for Simmons' character is genius. There are many memorable one- liners and skilfully performed scenes throughout. Chazelle has put so much work into the story, characters and screenplay, and it shows.The soundtrack features many electrifying jazz pieces and an original score by Justin Hurwitz. Every cue, every scene, every piece, is perfectly placed throughout the film and only adds to the brilliance displayed not only on-screen, but behind the scenes. As I've mentioned before many times, I always keep an eye out for camera work and how a director chooses to tell their story. The cinematography in Whiplash is stunning. There's a subtle colour grade over the shots, nothing distracting, feeling very appropriate for the mood of the film. Another item to look for is the editing. It's skilfully fast-paced and feels wonderfully fluent.Everything about this film is so vividly engaging and exceptionally thought-through. I can only thank Damien Chazelle, Sharone Meir, Tom Cross, Melanie Jones, Hunter Brown, Karuna Karmarkar, Lisa Norcia, Justin Hurwitz, Miles Teller, and J.K. Simmons, as well as everyone in the Art, Sound, Casting, Costume, and Music departments for their blood, sweat and tears in making this film possible.Verdict; Whiplash is simply remarkable. Featuring captivating visuals, intricate editing, an exciting soundtrack and two tour de force performances from Teller & Simmons. This is definitely my tempo.Whiplash, 10/10.",10,1,3,30 September 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Coen Brothers!
","Hail, Caesar! is written & directed by Joel & Ethan Coen and stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum. Set in the heart of 1950s Hollywood filmmaking, follow a day in the life of Capitol Pictures fixer Eddie Mannix, who solves problems for stars in the industry. When Baird Whitlock, the star of Hail, Caeser! goes missing, Eddie must deal with more than just the fix.THE COEN BROTHERS return with another beautiful piece of cinema. The 50s have never looked better on-screen with their incredible direction and charming screenplay. Roger Deakins teams up with the Bros. yet again with some of the most stunning visuals seen this year. It's unfortunate that this film has seen mostly bad reviews, and I can see where most people are coming from when I read through them. But as with all of the Coen Bros. films, the audience is split right down the middle. You either love or you hate, there is no in between. I personally found this to be a wonderful experience, I chuckled countable times throughout and whilst it's not the most complex story, there definitely is one present. I've seen a few people say it's just a lot of random scenes thrown together, but I didn't think it was like that at all. The best way to watch a film is to go in with no expectations. I saw this thinking it was going to be bad because I had read reviews but I came out with a smile on my face. Josh Brolin and George Clooney steal the screen with their ingenious and genuine performances, given the circumstances of the plot. The advertising may have you believe there's a lot of big names featured in the film - Jonah Hill is one of them - but they only have a short amount of screen time. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant in his scenes with Alden Ehrenreich, truly great chemistry and very simple writing, but the way it was delivered made it seem genius.Music by returning regular Carter Burwell was just as great as his previous work with the Coen's and approaches with huge choirs and orchestral movements. It feels aged and this is what is so brilliant about his work on this film. It blends in perfectly. Another beautiful score I'll be purchasing.The Coen's direct in such a complex way, that you can watch their films over and over again and pick up on things you may have missed the first time round. They capture the art of filmmaking in the 50s to a tee. It's a comedy satire, and it's extraordinarily good. The musical & dance numbers are also surprisingly catchy and fun to watch. Overall, it's not hilariously funny - but then it's not hilariously bad, either. It's a nice medium.My verdict; Hail, Caesar! triumphs in its old fashioned and simple storytelling and will not disappoint the fans. Spend a day in 1950s Hollywood and see this film in cinemas.Hail, Caesar!, 9/10.",9,0,1,4 March 2016
Finding Dory," Another wonderful effort from Pixar.
","Finding Dory is directed by Andrew Stanton & Angus MacLane and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neill, Hayden Rolence, Kaitlin Olson and Ty Burrell.The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.It's been 13 long years since we've visited the colourful world under the sea, wonderfully created by the Pixar Animation team, yet it feels like we never left. The story picks up 6 months after the events in Finding Nemo (2003), and takes us on a whole new journey with our favourite characters; Marlin, Nemo and of course, Dory. After the first film being such a hit amongst children and adults alike, it was always going to be a challenge for a sequel to live up to the greatness laid before. It's been rumoured for years and carefully discussed by the imaginative minds behind the scenes, thus it's been greatly anticipated by all fans of Pixar. Finding Dory may not tick all the boxes, but it has heart (three of them, in fact) and looks incredible. If you have the chance, 3D is something I highly recommend - which is something I don't usually do - because it simply works. There's a lot of vibrancy and depth created in this world that can only be truly witnessed in this format. That said, there's still a lot to love, regardless.We're all pretty familiar with the returning three main characters, so I don't need to tell you about those. What's really nice to see, and something Pixar are really skilled at, is the introduction of new characters you can instantly attach yourself to. Most notably, is Hank the Octopus. A very fun and friendly presence that really wouldn't have been possible to include in the predecessor 13 years ago, due to his impeccable detail. Also, Destiny and Bailey are particularly quirky and humorous additions to the line-up. Idris Elba and Dominic West both make great appearances as Fluke & Rudder and feel a lot like previous characters we've seen before, which isn't a bad thing. They actually deliver some pretty funny jokes during their screen time. Diane Keaton & Eugene Levy also give nice performances as Dory's parents.Everyone knows that Pixar strive in their incredible talent with computer generated animation. This movie looks absolutely amazing, just as the first feature did back in 2003, but with added texture and using techniques that just couldn't have been implemented at such times. Now that computer technology is so advanced, Pixar can really delve into some of their best ideas and create some more unforgettable characters and stories. Some of the only movies I bother watching in 3D are from Pixar, and this is because they know exactly what they're doing with such a format.Thomas Newman returns with another atmospheric and heartfelt score that flows peacefully in and out of scenes and touches on the action, comedy and drama throughout. A lot of the material is brand new which is great and as expected from Newman.Of course, when you go to see a Pixar movie you expect a message that's weaved into the story and this doesn't disappoint, by keeping the tradition alive. Its touching moments may not be as dramatic as seen before, but it's still relatable and pleasing to see. I'm very satisfied with this sequel, as a huge fan of the original (it being my second favourite Pixar feature, following Ratatouille) and I'm sure a lot of other fans will be pleased as well. I can't wait to watch it again.My verdict; Finding Dory is another wonderful effort from the hard-working men and women at Pixar Animation Studios, and a worthy sequel to a much loved movie by many. This is one to sea.Finding Dory, 9/10.",9,1,8,30 July 2016
Arrival," An Intelligent Sci-Fi Thriller.
","Arrival is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Michael Stuhlbarg, Forest Whitaker, Mark O'Brien, Abigail Pniowsky, Tzi Ma, Jadyn Malone and Julia Scarlett Dan.A linguist is recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications.With Sicario, Prisoners, Enemy and Incendies bringing his unique flair to the spotlight, Villeneuve takes on a new genre; Sci-Fi. This isn't your typical action-packed science fiction movie, this is an intelligent look at how we as human beings could interact with alien life.Amy Adams delivers a refreshingly relatable and emotional performance, with great depth and charisma. Jeremy Renner stars alongside Adams, presenting a new side to his acting abilities which strays away from his action hero characteristic. As the story flows consistently, so does the editing. With 'dream-like' scenes being used thoughtfully throughout to aid Adams' performance and overall character arc. Joe Walker proved himself worthy when he worked with Villeneuve on Sicario, presenting his distinctive skill, and so he shines furthermore with Arrival.The original score by Jóhann Jóhannsson is subtle in approach, yet intricate in detail. The introduction to the alien life-form is handled perfectly, using Jóhann's unique composition and eerie writing to punctuate the unusual entity. Having worked with Villeneuve before on Sicario and Prisoners, the familiarity is present, touching on the sparse and complex sound design that featured before. Highlighting the beautifully dark 'Heptapod B' which utilises unintelligible vocal lines, further exploring and expanding upon his talent. This sets Jóhannsson apart from all other film composers and has become one of the most influential people for me personally.Something that's always been so wonderfully attached to Villeneuve's work is the cinematography, which in Arrival, is undeniably beautiful. The locations and landscapes are captured with absolute care and provide a remarkable canvas for the story to be told. The special and visual effects are also appreciable and showcase an unearthly visual design for the extraterrestrial beings. There's one shot that gave me a quick flashback to the final scene in Enemy, which I won't go into. Bradford Young encapsulates this skilfully.The art direction, set decoration and production design is fluent and feels authentic. Everyone involved has done an incredible job to provide a genuine backdrop for Villeneuve and team to work in. I'd also like to share my appreciation for the sound department. Dave Whitehead, who has quite an impressive CV, has created an entangled and twisted language for the aliens, only to be experienced in theatres.Verdict; Arrival is not an action-packed Independence Day. This is a carefully constructed and well-directed story that keeps you thinking way beyond the closing credits. Denis Villeneuve's winning streak lives on.Arrival, 9/10.",9,6,15,12 November 2016
The Big Short," 'Truth is like poetry. And most people f**king hate poetry.'
","The Big Short is directed by Adam McKay and stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. A noticeable 'bubble' underneath the US housing market has been realised by Michael Burry. He believes that in the next few years this bubble will burst. The Big Short tells the story of the guys that decide to take on the banks for their greed and lack of foresight.Most people hate these types of movies. They say they're all a bunch of gibberish and that they're boring. Adam McKay has done something great here, he's done something like Scorsese did with The Wolf Of Wall Street. He made it tragically funny. It's obvious that he was going to bring some comedic value to the table after his previous work with Will Ferrell. I only ever found Step Brothers funny, though. I felt with the others he tried too hard. That's probably due to my distaste in Ferrell's work, however. So I'm happy to finally say that there's another Adam McKay film that I actually like. This is brilliant.The screenplay is written with seriousness in mind, yet playful when the mood gets too heavy. The casting is perfect. Christian Bale acts as a strange and confusing businessman who has trouble communicating face-to-face. Ryan Gosling breaks the 4th wall to keep the audience engaged and up to speed. In fact, many of the characters do from time to time. McKay decided to bring in actors such as Margot Robbie to explain what is happening, as a means to prove that these businessmen just use technical terms to seem like they are the only ones who can do their job. Selena Gomez appeared as one of the many cameos in this film, and she was surprisingly good. Brad Pitt was great as Ben Rickert, who lives away from it all and grows his own vegetables. He likes to talk about it a lot. These main characters are all brilliant, but there's some charm in the supporting cast, too. John Magaro brings an undeniably strong performance to the film and shines whenever he appears on screen. Finn Wittrock, too. They both share some notable chemistry. Music by Nicholas Britell is pretty good. I felt it only really aided the film in the final act, nothing stood out to me before that point. There were some nice piano melodies, however. I'd like to comment on the editing of this film. I thought it was handled really well. It felt loose and choppy, but not in a bad way. I actually found it entertaining to watch, along with the sounds that were used, especially in scenes with Bale as Burry. Very quick and disjointed but not distracting or jolting. Barry Ackroyd shot a lot of the scenes of dialogue with close, intimate angles. Very personal and unique. The whole film is shot like a documentary, with the sharp zooming and characters talking to the audience. I love this kind of filmmaking. It feels like you're in the room and part of the conversation. Engaging work.My verdict; The Big Short is one of those films that just work. The last time I enjoyed a film in this genre was back in 2013, with The Wolf Of Wall Street. So far I'm very happy with how the year has started. Many great films are being made and fortunately being recognised by critics and award organisations alike. Let's hope The Big Short continues with its spree of wins.

Wonder Woman," 'The evolution of Gadot's Wonder Woman is inspiring to watch.'
","Wonder Woman is directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston, Saïd Taghmaoui and Ewen Bremner.Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny. (12A cert; 141 mins)The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is now in full swing. We've seen Superman take flight, Batman battling evil in Gotham, and the Suicide Squad fighting the bad with bad. Now, it's time to welcome a new hero; Wonder Woman.Patty Jenkins has received a lot of praise from fans and critics alike as Wonder Woman takes the world by storm. It's clear why; she's a very talented director and skilled within the action genre. Some of the action sequences are wonderfully captured, it's easy to follow and smooth in the edit. She understands the characters and directs the two leads well. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are both incredible in their respective roles. Their writing is realistic, you care for them both, truly. However, the screenplay is just as bland as the other DCEU entries. It's funny and inviting, but as the film progresses in its slow pace, the layers start to uncover, revealing its generic story and predictable outcome. Gadot's Wonder Woman is fierce, bold, beautiful. She and Pine are the saving grace, that goes without saying, but the overdose of CGI and the exaggerated yet anti-climatic finale left me feeling empty.That said, it is without a doubt the best DCEU instalment yet, in terms of production and performances. The WWI setting is gritty and dark, as it should be. We get to see how Diana reacts to the evils of war and that was a really nice direction. We see her vulnerable, but we also see her stronger than ever. You'll leave the theatre thinking about one scene in particular; No Man's Land. It's beautifully crafted with some goosebump-worthy moments. I'm sure it'll go down as one of the most memorable scenes in DCEU history.Rupert Gregson-Williams' original score is powerfully moving. There's a moment where Tina Guo skilfully performs Hans Zimmer's kick-ass Wonder Woman theme in one of the most rewarding fights I've seen. Rupert's music is action-packed, but it's the grounded connection between Diana and Steve where he truly delivers. It's a delightful score and functionally superb.It's not a bad film, it's still enjoyable as a stand-alone Wonder Woman epic. Just don't go ahead with high expectations, you'll more than likely leave disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much, given the flooding positive response. There's a lot that could have gone wrong, making it as lacklustre as BvS and Suicide Squad, but it stood up and at least tried to tell a unique and fulfilling story. Above all else, the evolution of Gadot's Wonder Woman is inspiring to watch.Verdict; Gal Gadot & Chris Pine are both wonderful and deliver some truly beautiful moments, but the story lacks momentum, suffering pacing issues and becoming just as tedious as the other DCEU entries.Wonder Woman – ★★★ (6/10)",7,3,11,7 June 2017
Mother!," 'An exhilarating ride of biblical proportions.'
","mother! is written & directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brian Gleeson and Domnhall Gleeson.A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. (18 cert; 121 mins)As I'm writing this, it has been a few days since I experienced Darren Aronofsky's psychological experiment; mother!, yet the thought of this incredible film remains. I'm still working out the various allegories in my mind during day-to-day life, the impact of mother! is still felt.mother! has received a lot of backlash from audiences since its release and I can understand why. It's a tough watch, in fact the first two acts are slow-burn, which means the average movie-goer will lose concentration. Don't let the negative reviews and underwhelming box office numbers put you off, though. this is a thought-provoking film and a very ambitious and brave move by Aronofsky. It isn't an invasion horror like the trailers lead you to believe, and perhaps that's where most of the backlash comes from. This is one of those films that will try to disorientate you, but after some research, it becomes a work of genius. Within its disturbing final act is a clear message.Jennifer Lawrence seems to be getting some heat for her acting style. According to the majority, she never changes the way she acts in all of her projects. Now, I could agree for some of her films, but in mother! she is literally put through hell. I can imagine it was difficult to bring these scenes to life, especially those in the final act, but she performs remarkably well and consistently throughout. I felt like I was experiencing everything right there with her. Javier Bardem plays a rather mysterious character, who disappears every now and then but reappears in the strangest way. It's hard to put into words how this film makes you feel when watching, but I'd stick to what I mentioned earlier about being disorientated. Javier has a hand in this feeling, and I think he brought a lot to the role. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are simply brilliant. Again, bringing a sense of suspicion that constantly gets weirder and weirder as the story plays out. The Gleeson brothers have fairly small roles but play quite an important part in the grand scheme of things. This is something to read further into after having seen the film. What I can say, though, is that they were a fine support act.Moving on to the visual side of things; the house set looks stunning. We see it as it's being decorated and furnished by Lawrence's character, so there's a lot of details documenting this process. Part of why the house looks and feels so real is because mother! was shot on Super 16mm film. A format I will always highly praise for its extremely natural capturing of light and the grittiness that kisses the screen in the upscale. Utilising close-up, over-the- shoulder and point-of-view shots, Matthew Libatique puts us right into the story. They even went as far as to build the set so that the camera could move freely in a 360 degree fashion. We see everything as mother does, and that's something I really appreciated. Finally, the visual and special effects, though minuscule, were bitingly real. I can't, and won't, go into the specifics, but there are some scenes that felt too real. but not in the bad way. It wouldn't have impacted me the same way if they were handled differently.This is usually where I'd mention the composers work on a film. But, seeing as there's no score for mother!, I'll talk about the sound. Composer JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson spent about a year writing original music for this film, but after test screenings, both he and Aronofsky decided against using the score. JÃ³hannson wasn't entirely out of the job, however. With his music being very ambient, he ended up working as a sound consultant alongside Craig Henighan to create the 'sound' of the house. There's the expected knocks and creaks, but it's when mother starts to break down that we hear sounds (such as glass) stretch out further than they realistically could. I found this really quite unnerving; a unique and interesting way to tackle sound design. That said, I would love to hear some of what JÃ³hannsson wrote originally, maybe a cut of the film with the score? Either way, mother! worked very well with its absence of score, I liked that as a viewer I didn't have something telling me how to feel. It all felt very raw.There's really not much else to say. I've not experienced much else like it, apart from Denis Villenueve's Enemy back in 2013. Many people will say that if a film makes you search up the meaning afterwards, it's a failure. I respectfully disagree. I like to go deeper into the story, and I find it fascinating reading other people's theories and impressions. Think back to Donnie Darko, that still sparks conversation even after 16 years.I think everyone should give mother! a go. Form your own opinions. It will always be divisive. People who love it will love it. People who hate it will hate it. This is the beauty of filmmaking. I'm in no way religious, but I found the concept simply brilliant and the execution, though disturbing, fantastic.Verdict; A dark, disturbing psychological thriller that thrives in a mysterious tension. mother! is an exhilarating ride of biblical proportions.mother! â€“ â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… (9/10)",9,5,13,20 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not as great as it should have been.
","Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice is directed by Zack Snyder and stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Lawrence Fishburne and Gal Gadot. Following the great battle between General Zod and Superman, Metropolis slowly rebuilds as they struggle to decide what hero the world really needs. Bruce Wayne disagrees with Clark Kent's actions, so he comes forward as Bat of Gotham to face the Son of Krypton as Lex Luthor works on his own crazy plan.If it sounds complicated, it is. If it sounds like there's too much happening at once, there is. Batman V Superman feels clunky, unfinished, and truly too long for the content it holds.I'd like to point out the things I enjoyed about this highly-anticipated sequel, before I touch on all of the things I didn't like.Firstly, Ben Affleck is brilliant as Bruce Wayne & Batman. He has the right build, mood, charisma and enthusiasm to be the Dark Knight. As far as I'm concerned, Affleck IS Batman from this point on. I felt that he was underused in this film which is slightly disappointing, but maybe they're saving the big guns for the solo venture. He will also be appearing in Suicide Squad so there will be more time to learn about this character in his portrayal. Eisenberg did a pretty mediocre job as Lex Luthor in the first half of the film, but slowly crawls into character towards the final scenes. I look forward to seeing more of him. Finally, I thought Henry Cavill held up the character nicely, the same as he did in Man of Steel, which is to be expected. I'm still pretty satisfied with him being Superman.Moving on to the things I didn't like, or the 'cons', if you will.The entire feature feels like the film was shot, edited, cut, chucked around, and finally put back together but in all the wrong places. Like playing with a jigsaw puzzle and realising you have a few pieces missing. I was watching the story play out, but I never for a second felt attached to any of the characters or even interested or invested in the drama & action sequences. A lot of the camera-work is hand-held, with very quick close-up shots of the characters, making it difficult to follow the action. The music by Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL is even more unfitting than it was for Man of Steel, apart from Superman's theme; which is stunning. In terms of the new Batman theme, I couldn't pick it out. I was listening very hard but I just couldn't hear it. Both soundtracks sound fantastic on their own, but when accompanied with the picture, it just doesn't sit right. I'm a huge fan of Zimmer's work and I hate to be disappointed, but this time I was.The story is everywhere but where it should be. You'll be watching a scene and then it will cut to black and start again with another character in another place. This happens too many times during this film, which I am not a fan of. Man of Steel suffered the same but was used almost correctly enough to forgive it. Here, though, it's too noticeable and it pulls you right out of the experience.The biggest problem I had with BvS was the CGI. There's very little practical effects and an extreme use of CG to up the ante but it falls flat. Lens flares cover up all of the action sequences which were considerably average (apart from a few praise-worthy scenes) and this adds to the overall mess. Doomsday is just ridiculous. I've never been a fan of over-the-top destruction in films, it doesn't click with me. Man of Steel only featured about 30 minutes of unnecessary demolition but this film blows it out of the park, in a bad way.The best this film has to offer is the introduction to Affleck's Batman, and though he was underused, I believe he is a great choice for the role. Eisenberg's Lex Luthor grows into a pretty awesome character, also. If you're a major DC/Superman fan then you've already seen it and you probably loved it. Which is absolutely fine; I just didn't think it was as great as it SHOULD have been. Personally, I preferred Man of Steel.My verdict; Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice is a fair attempt at bringing two of the most iconic DC Comic characters together to fight head-to-head. It kicks off the Justice League with power and will most likely please the fans. Just don't expect something as focused and carefully crafted as Nolan's Batman trilogy.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 'Chewie, we're home.'
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams (Star Trek, Lost) and stars a compelling cast of new and old faces; Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels and Mark Hamill. The Force has awakened, and a new threat arises. Set three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, The First Order are determined to rule the galaxy and only our new set of heroes, with the help of the Resistance, can stop them. The First Order's leader, Kylo Ren, has an ambitious task; to find and destroy the last of the Jedi.That's all you need to know. The rest is a journey through time and space, back to the glorious days when practical effects and Panavision film cameras were the golden standard in filmmaking, and computer-generated images were kept to a bare minimum. This movie is a true work of art, it's as real as it gets. This is the Star Wars we've all been waiting for since RoTJ. JJ made sure that everything was shot on real locations and miniature models were used for exterior shots of space cruisers and star ships in order to achieve the aesthetics of the original trilogy. He succeeds with an expert eye for detail and a tremendous charisma for writing and screenplay. The story flows with ease and constantly pulls you into the world we've all known and loved - and quite frankly, missed - for many years.The new cast is outstanding. This is Daisy Ridley's first major movie and she leads the way with a brilliant performance of strength and emotion. What a way to kick-off, what I'm certain is going to be a very positive, and rewarding career. John Boyega previously starred in Attack The Block (2011) and quickly grabbed Abrams' attention with his role, thus bringing him to the Galaxy. He portrays a character we can all connect with, an outsider who has been thrown into this world. Every movie needs to have at least one character that can connect to the audience, it's a very important factor in filmmaking. If you don't have that element, you have no bridge from screen to audience. Boyega and Ridley have done a fantastic job at doing this, along with the brilliant and talented writers who brought these new characters to life. Adam Driver was electrifying and genuinely feels like a threat under Kylo Ren's mask. Everything from the distorted voice to the hunched walk, the heavy-wielded lightsaber and the drive for success is perfect. Oscar Isaac is in an energetic performance as Poe Dameron, a pilot, who needs to reconnect with his droid, BB-8. I'm very much looking forward to the next instalments to see where these new faces are heading, and I'm very happy to say that I love each and every one of them. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Mark Hamill all return to reprise their roles from the original trilogy and they still have the same witty charm that we all recognise. That's all I'll say on those characters, as I'm sure you'll be wanting to discover each of their stories for yourself. Of course the music is perfect, as John Williams returns to the franchise with a tour de force score that hits notes of love, hope, and excitement as we all watch the performances on-screen. No one should ever write music for Star Wars, apart from Williams. It has become such a huge part of these movies, that if anyone else did helm the music, it would feel very different, very unsettling. Themes from the original trilogy return in full-force, with some new character cues that will soon catch your ears and start-up the humming bug again. I've always had a huge appreciation for directors that not only decide to shoot on film, but use practical effects. Nothing will ever take you completely into the world of a movie as well as these two things. Too much CGI is being used in filmmaking nowadays and it's rather sad to see that. But, with directors like J.J. Abrams, I know I have hope, and I believe it's making a big comeback soon. It's already in affect.My verdict; As a huge and loyal fan of the original trilogy, I am very happy to say that this is an extremely satisfying continuation and a beautifully shot and directed instalment by J.J. Abrams. Thank you. The audience I was a part of applauded you, and I've heard that many other very happy fans have done the same, too. The quote 'Chewie, we're home' could not put it any better. Welcome home.Star Wars: The Force Awakens, 10/10.",9,5,28,18 December 2015
Deadpool," 'I'm touching myself tonight.'
","Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller and stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller and Ed Skrein.Finally, after 11 years of kissing the 'behinds' of 20th Century Fox, and the 'private area' of Wolverine, Reynolds' Deadpool has landed, hard. Which is a bit impractical on the knees. (Yes, that was a reference.) But nevertheless, completely and utterly brilliant. This is Tim Miller's directional debut and an incredible one at that. The pacing is quick and sharp, the screenplay by Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick is fantastic, the explicitly violent and gory sequences are, well, gory, and the on-screen chemistry between characters and we, us... the audience, is genius. Breaking multiple fourth walls and walls within walls, Reynolds has given us the 'Merc with a mouth' we all deserve. This is an origin story, but it realises this and drifts completely from the usual formula or story arc used in superhero movies. Instead it kicks off with Wade Wilson as Deadpool, in a taxi, with a mission. To find the guy that messed him up. Then, as the film progresses, Deadpool tells us how he became who he is. It's very unique, and it's one of the things I really appreciated about this film.The original music score by Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL is perfect. The synthesisers incorporated fit the character of Deadpool with absolute ease. It's not used to extremes, but you notice its presence. More notably, the soundtrack is brilliant. It has some classic tracks intertwined into the story, reminiscent of Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy back in 2014. This just adds to the chaos of Deadpool on his road of rampage, quite literally.The visual effects and set designs are substantial, I felt the main CG characters were nicely handled, and rendered into the surroundings really well. But I felt a lot of the overall CG versions of set pieces could have been worked on a little more, just to smoothen it out. The opening credits are perfect. Very fun, unique and amusing. The animation is spot-on.I really had a lot of fun with this film, and I believe it's the best Marvel has offered, period. Everyone involved has done a terrific job bringing the beloved Deadpool to life, and it has paid off big time. Bring on the (now confirmed) sequel!One more thing I'd like to praise is the editing. I feel with a lot of action films these days, there are way too many sharp cuts that pull you from what's happening. Editor Julian Clarke has handled this outstandingly, with longer shots so you can really focus on everything that's progressing on-screen. This is a good thing, but I really wish the overall cut was longer. Maybe they'll be a special cut for the home release.You're probably wondering if there's the usual 'Marvel post-credits scene' and of course, there is. It's a little different, as you'd expect from Deadpool, but it's just as brilliant as the film itself. You have to wait until the very end of the credit roll to see it, so sit tight. It's worth it. Also, there is a Stan Lee cameo, and it's hilariously planned. My verdict; Deadpool is now my favourite on-screen Marvel character, taking over from Ant-Man. I believe Reynolds and Miller will have pleased the many fans that have been wishing this day would come... Come? (Oh, you're naughty.)Deadpool, 9/10.",9,39,82,10 February 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the most carefully crafted war films I've ever experienced.
","Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Milo Gibson, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Based on the incredible true story, WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss, who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.It's taken me a while to digest Mel Gibson's brutal epic Hacksaw Ridge, roaring with fire and an undying courage shown in Garfield's deeply rooted portrayal of Desmond T. Doss, but at this point after sitting on time for a moment, I can safely say that this is one of most carefully crafted war films I have ever had the pleasure to, in some ways, endure.Andrew Garfield's performance in this film is bitterly convincing, gripping the viewer with a biting display of emotion shown within the conscientious objector. A background of Doss' life is shown within the first 20 minutes, which aids his character and helps the viewer connect with his many decisions that occur during the heavily textured battle, leading to saving 75 lives on the front line. Not only does Garfield provide an emotional core, he goes through all kinds of hell, crawling between the gruesome display of the fallen and wounded.It would be all for nothing, however, without Gibson's skillful direction. He and cinematographer Simon Duggan capture the Art, Special Effects and Stunt department's hard work with eyes of an eagle, utilising smart camera set-ups that assist the unravelling chaos and destruction unfolding around the cast. The supporting cast of Luke Bracey, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Teresa Palmer and Vince Vaughn are truly wonderful. Each individual provides a delightful back-and-fourth between themselves and Garfield. Vaughn breaks from his comedic persona (almost entirely) and shines light on a new side to his acting abilities. Many of his scenes are smartly written and engaging, whilst finding the perfect time to improvise his lines, adding a much-needed comic relief. Hugo Weaving is incredible in one of his best roles yet. Delivering a powerhouse performance that ties with Garfield's, showcasing several layers of hate, sadness and regret, detailed beautifully in his fine acting.Original music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is satisfactory, though missing something of great importance; distraught emotion. It's great at filling the gaps with heroic themes, but I never felt moved by the score in any huge way. In the final moments of the film I do admit to have felt hopeful and 'pumped' but I thought the score had an absence of fear and angst. This could be due to Gibson's direction though, as ultimately the director has the final say. However, I believe the space is filled with an impeccably thorough bed of sound, expertly created by the Sound Department and adeptly mixed and edited, earning 2 Academy Award nominations. The battle sequences are intricate and complex, captured beautifully in-camera and driven by highly intense and scary situations that spring up out of nowhere. It's a tough experience to get through, but it's undeniably well put together, seriously powerful and absolutely worth it.Verdict; Hacksaw Ridge is riveting and bathed in gore, however, underneath the brutality is a fine true story of survival and heroism.Hacksaw Ridge, 9/10.",9,3,6,29 January 2017
Sully," 'A Sublime Experience.'
","Sully: Miracle on the Hudson is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Valarie Mahaffey, Anna Gunn and Mike O'Malley.The story of Chesley Sullenberger, an American pilot who became a hero after landing his damaged plane on the Hudson River in order to save the flight's passengers and crew.With the remarkable emergency landing on the Hudson River lasting only 208 seconds, I wondered how director Clint Eastwood could handle such an event in 96 minutes. Shot almost entirely on IMAX 65mm cameras and featuring stellar performances from Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, Sully does not disappoint.Eastwood's visual style stays intact throughout as he and cinematographer Tom Stern team up once again, capturing the extraordinary brilliance and sheer tension of the now- famous 'Miracle' on January 15th, 2009. With a story that cuts between the overwhelming news coverage and the landing itself, Sully feels incredibly fresh and grounded.Tom Hanks' performance as Chesley Sullenberger is wonderfully realistic and touching. There are a few moments in the final scenes that really pull the whole picture together in the most satisfying way, and this is greatly supported by Hanks' phenomenal act. Alongside is Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, who brings a lighter shade to the film, delivering some acceptable and amusing lines of dialogue that feels absolutely necessary when securing the film's human touch.Composer Christian Jacob and The Tierney Sutton Band take a personal approach when tackling the project, with ravishing piano pieces and lush string arrangements smoothly weaved into the picture, culminating as the screen turns black.Blu Murray returns to aid Eastwood as editor and this resembles all of their previous work together. The cutting here is masterfully handled, ensuring all scenes are flowing with attentive care whilst providing a fast-paced and sublime experience.With over 50 years of proficiency in acting and helming over 30 directional projects, Clint Eastwood has become one of the greatest icons of the film industry. Yet, even with so much under his belt, he can pull off something different and unique each time. Sully is a fine example of that. Truly wonderful filmmaking.Verdict; Although taking place on the Hudson River, Sully feels undeniably grounded in its masterful direction and skillful undertaking.

Alien: Covenant," 'Ridley Scott's second pre-Alien entry is visually satisfying but lacks in story.'
","Alien: Covenant is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterson, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demián Bichir and Carmen Ejogo.The crew of a colony ship, bound for a remote planet, discover an uncharted paradise with a threat beyond their imagination, and must attempt a harrowing escape.After the lacklustre Prometheus in 2012, I had no good expectations going into Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant. Apart from a few decently tense scenes and beautiful visuals, Prometheus was a mindless action/adventure flick set in the world of Alien. It's worth noting that I'm not overly keen on the franchise as a whole, so I'm biased. However, I do appreciate what Ridley Scott did with the original 1979 film.When I go to watch an Alien film, I want it to send shivers down my spine. There must be scenes filled with nothing but tension. Thankfully, Alien: Covenant handles this extremely well. There are some really awesome moments that keep you on the edge of your seat. The final action sequence in the film is stunning to watch. That said, these moments are few and far between, so we're left with a story that doesn't seem to be heading in any specific direction, apart from leading into the original film.The characters, excluding Daniels (Katherine Waterson) and David/Walter (Michael Fassbender), are poorly written and act unintelligently. One scene in particular, without spoiling anything, was an eye-roller. Why would anyone in their right mind look directly into an egg that is quite clearly hatched? It's understandable that this person has never seen one before, but the moment he lets his guard down, a Facehugger continues its life cycle by latching onto the host. The only two interesting characters are Daniels and David / Walter. Waterson is a fine actress and demonstrates this in all of her scenes. Fassbender works wonders in his double-performance, though maybe too much time was spent on his character(s), therefore detracting from the other crew members. Tennessee (Danny McBride) is present for a brief sense of comic relief and while McBride has his moments, it's an act just as one-dimensional as the rest.As aforementioned, this film is a visual treat. It's dark, gritty and unearthly. The production and costume design is remarkably well-handled and looks impressive, captured skilfully by cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, who has worked with Ridley Scott on numerous occasions. There are some gruesome deaths, of course, and these are handled really nicely. I'm always ready for some gore in a film, and Covenant did it right.Jed Kurzel's score is exceptional. It pleases me to say that his music was something I enjoyed about this film. After his disappointing work on Assassin's Creed, it's truly great to see him explore the vast eeriness present in Covenant and succeed. Some of the string work heard in the score is incredibly well written, as well as the woodwind sections that open the main theme. Not only does it work as a score, but it's musically twisted and an enjoyable listening experience overall.Verdict; Whilst it strives in apprehension and its visual design, Ridley Scott's second entry in the prequel trilogy feels as empty as its characters, culminating to an anticlimactic finale.Alien: Covenant – ★★★ (5/10)",5,6,14,14 May 2017
The Godfather," Simply a masterpiece.
","The Godfather is written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall and Richard Conte.The ageing patriarch of an organised crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.Whenever you get into a discussion with someone about filmmaking or ask about their favourite movies of all time, at some point they will mention The Godfather. There's a very simple explanation for this, and it's something to be discovered when experiencing the movie for yourself.It's very clear how incredibly well written this movie is, from the first scene, to the last. Not only the writing, but the magnetic performances throughout are consistently showcased against a backdrop of New York from 1945-1955. One of the reasons this movie is so beautiful is because of how realistic it is. Although we can't say we've been a part of an empire like featured in the movie, we can all relate to the characters. It's a dark and tragic story.The acting as aforementioned is phenomenal. Brando is vitally important in his convincing portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. As is Al Pacino as he gradually becomes the front-man during the movie's running-length. Caan has a heart-breaking turn in his character's arc, and he performs wonderfully. The same for Duvall, Conte and everyone else not mentioned. The list is too long to name each individual, but they don't go unnoticed.Although this is a long movie, there's so much going on and in such intricate detail that the time effortlessly drifts by. Every character has a chance to transform within the time-frame. Don't be put off by the duration. Many filmmakers these days are afraid of making their work too long, but if done correctly, it can be a tremendous piece of art. This movie is a fine example of that fact.The original score by Nino Rota is one of the most recognised soundtracks of all time, and respectfully so. There are moments where his music is used greatly, and moments where it isn't used at all. While this happens the music is changing also. It's the perfect sound for such a story, and pairs with the picture brilliantly.Verdict; The Godfather is widely regarded as a masterpiece. One of the greatest movies of our time. I can fully agree with these statements and add that in its many years since release, it hasn't aged a bit. If you haven't yet experienced The Godfather, please do yourself a favour. With so much greatness in front of you, it's an offer you can't refuse.The Godfather, 10/10.",10,0,0,12 September 2016
