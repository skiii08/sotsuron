The Blair Witch Project," A Good Scare
","I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was original and the cast did a good job of convincing you that what they were experiencing was real. It is a low-budget movie and it shows but I expected that. Yes the camera does move up and down, up and down to the point that it can really bother you. To me a movie like this is a refreshing change from Scream and all of the other teen flicks that have come out the past few years. The main difference between Blair Witch and the others is that BW is actually scary and creepy whereas the others are too busy making jokes and showing shots of buxom teens with low-cut sweaters. This movie concerns itself with one thing: scaring the crap out of the viewer!",Null,0,1,30 September 1999
Unbreakable," More Like Unbearable
","After seeing the Sixth Sense, I had pretty high expectations for this film. I was disappointed to say the least. While the performances from Willis and Jackson were good as usual, I was dismayed by the pace of the film (and the story). At times the film creeps along at a snail's pace in a fashion of utter boredom and dreadful silence. I felt like I was in a library.Also, some of the camera angles that the director used were absolutely irritating! Towards the beginning of the film when David Dunn is talking to the female sports agent, the angle of the shoot was constantly being shifted between the seats on the trains. After awhile the distraction of the seats took away from the conversation between the two characters. In addition when Dunn plays 'superhero' and goes to the victims' house to catch the killer, the camera is kept behind a flowing curtain to where the viewer cannot see inside the house. This seems like it went for way too long and was just simply annoying. Disappointing movie.",Null,0,0,26 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not The Greatest But Still Enjoyable
","What can I say that has not already been said? First off, many people love to bash this movie because they loath George Lucas. They say that it does not compare to A New Hope or Empire. Well, maybe it doesn't. But perhaps part of the reason for this is simply that many of us were young impressionable children in 1977 or 1980 and so we were more likely to be overwhelmed by a picture (any picture) than we are today.Having said that, I will say that this movie certainly has its flaws. Unlike a lot of people, I did not find the visual effects to be as impressive as some viewers. A great deal of the effects reminded of a high tech video game. The performance of Hayden Christensen was not exceptional but okay. Natalie Portman did a fine job. The story still seems a little empty to me, in terms of information that Lucas has yet to cover (i.e.: the Solo family, the conversion of Anakin to Vader, Anakin's children, Grand Moff Tarkin and so on). Worth seeing and certainly an improvement over Phantom Menace but by no means a masterpiece.",7,0,0,6 June 2002
American Beauty," Good but not great
","I saw this movie after it had been out for about a week. I had heard and read critics just showering the movie with praise. The performances are impressive (especially Spacey). However, I was ultimately disappointed. I will not give away the ending, but it is not a surprise since you know from the very beginning what is going to happen. I feel that it would have been much more effective had we not known from the beginning that Spacey's character is going to be murdered. I like Annette Benning, but failed to see why everyone was making such a fuss over her performance. Most of the movie she is either slapping herself in the head or bitching. Mena Suvari was certainly pleasing to the eye, but again, her character was annoying. It was hard to find sympathy for anyone besides Spacey, excepts perhaps his drug dealing wierdo teenage boy neighbor. The movie was not bad, but comparing it to the Graduate is absurd!",7,0,0,15 December 1999
Man on the Moon," Carrey gives a really good performance, but the movie is so-so
","After seeing Jim Carrey in both dramatic and comedic roles, I was not quite sure what to expect from this movie. After seeing it, I feel that Carrey is a really talented comic and an above average actor. He gives an impressive performance through out the film although at times he looks as if he is trying to hard. Part of the problem is that he chose to play a man who really was not that funny to begin with so it was hard to empathize with some of the more 'heartbreaking' scenes of the film. The public never really understood what Kaufman was trying to do and I think this movie simply states that. Carrey does give a good performance though.",Null,1,2,1 September 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Splendid Film!
",Not sure what I can say about this movie that has not already been said over and over. It is a great movie. The acting is strong and sincere. The story or plot is what makes this movie something more that a big fight-fest. You cannot discuss the strengths of the film without mentioning the visual effects as well. This deserves to win the Oscar for Best Picture although I do not think it will.,Null,0,0,8 March 2001
Coyote Ugly," Pretty Bad Stuff
","This may not be the worst movie you see this year but it sure tries. CORNY!!!!!! The acting is wel below par and some seens in the movie are downright insulting. Case in point: in one scene one of the 'coyotes' is fixing to get gang-raped by a group of sailors, but Piper comes to the rescue by singing a Blondie song which brings everything back to normal! What????? This is one lame effort at making a film. I could go on and on but too many other people already have. Bad stuff!",Null,1,1,8 August 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," More Over-Hyped Fluff from Kubrick
","After seeing a number of Kubrick films, I still fail to see why many consider him such a genius. Eyes Wide Shut is enjoyable only for the ample sex and nudity which dominates the film. Like many of his other films it meanders its way through a murky story that seemingly is going in circles. Then all of a sudden the movie just ends. There are not too many movies today that can bomb at the box office with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in starring roles. The movie is not bad but it is far from a 'masterpiece'.",5,0,1,6 March 2000
Pulp Fiction," I Can Watch this Movie Over and Over!
","What a great movie! This movie has it all. Supsense, action, humor and some of the best dialogue I have ever heard. The performances are nearly flawless, Jackson, Travolta, Stolz, Thurman, Roth, Keitel, too. The music is also great. The movie is very hard to describe and is not for everyone. This is one of the best films to come out in my lifetime and is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. Truly, a must see!",Null,1,2,14 July 2002
Detroit Rock City," Pretty Stupid but It Does Have Its Moments
","I just saw this movie on cable the other night. Pretty silly and just as unbelievable. Good soundtrack, though. Edward Furlong did a good job and the movie does have its moments of humor as crude as they may be.",Null,1,3,29 June 2000
Sweet and Lowdown," Penn's Performance is Great but Morton steals the show
","I just watched this movie earlier today and I liked it. Sean Penn just proves once again that he is one of the finest actors of his generation. His performance of Emmett Ray is mesmerising, comic, sad and most certainly memorable. Morton, however, really steals the show for me. Although she does not verbally speak a word the entire movie, her eyes and facial expressions communicate in a way that is unique and touching. This is not a great movie but it is an enjoyable trip back in  time that shows how much things have changed during the 20th century.",Null,0,0,12 March 2000
High Fidelity," Slightly Above Average Romantic Comedy
","Pretty enjoyable work with Cusack being cocky and philosophical as a young confused man who cannot seem to get a grip on love, past or present. Good soundtrack and some good lines from Jack Black as one of his crazy workers at his record store. A number of small parts from Catherine Zeta Jones, Lisa Bonet and others who play his ex-girlfriends only add to his confusion but in the end he seems to have figured it out, maybe.",7,0,0,2 April 2000
