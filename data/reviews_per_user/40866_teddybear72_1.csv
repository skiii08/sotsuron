The King's Speech," Brilliantly executed. Poorly rated by the MPAA
","After I saw this movie in theaters I fell in love with it. The back and forth banter between the two main characters is brilliantly played and extremely well timed. Each character (a few from 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Harry Potter') was perfectly played, even Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Lionel Logue's wife I felt was under appreciated. A standing ovation to the entire cast and creative team.A huge thumbs down to the MPAA for rating this in the same category as movies like 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and 'The Hangover'. Yes there were a few swear words, but most happen in one scene, one right after the other and is very pertinent to the film. At worst this film should have a PG-13.",10,0,1,22 July 2012
