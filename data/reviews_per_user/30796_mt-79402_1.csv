Blade Runner 2049," Don't watch. Completely waste of time.
",Movie is too long. Story is way too simple. Maybe the director think there is twist but it is definitely not. A bit of everything while not successful in any part of it. Using CGI in sex part. How it is relevant to the story? Sony logo is everywhere. A completely waste of time. Don't watch it.,1,69,146,6 October 2017
