Sucker Punch," Loved it
","I was so pleasantly surprised by this move that I felt compelled to leave these comments - my first 'review' here on IMDb.I really connected with this movie. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful. The soundtrack amazing. And Emily Browning's character, Baby Doll, was nothing short of hypnotic.Even though I'm sure it wasn't intended, I felt true emotion with Emily's character throughout the movie. I was angered, saddened, and exhilarated right along with her.In fact, even on my third viewing of the film, each several months apart, I found myself so angered at the treatment of Baby Doll that I had literal tears flowing. Something not so easy to bring out of me.To me the film represents the perfect combination of fantasy, art, story line and acting. I absolutely loved it.",10,4,9,7 January 2013
The Descent," Excellent Thriller/Horror Movie Made Perfect!
","What you have here is an excellently executed thriller/horror flick.This film plays equally well against your fears of darkness, claustrophobia and the unknown.My advice - watch it on a dark night with no distractions.Though touted as a horror film, and there are some horror scenes, the film is far more about suspense. In fact one part of this movie literally startled a friend of mine - a grown man - into letting out a scream like a little girl!By far one of my favorite movies of all time. To this day this represents the one and only 10-out-of-10 rating I have ever given.",10,2,5,20 February 2013
