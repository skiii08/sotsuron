Marie Antoinette," Absolute Crap with capital C
","My poor fellow American friends! I would have loved to see a great movie about this captivating part of french history, unfortunately, the taste of the director, who I suspect, succeeded in the career thanks to her last name, is absolutely grotesque, ludicrous and so far from the historical truth. It is one thing to try to make art movies with random subjects of modern life, but it becomes extremely more hazardous with historical movies. In that case, the director must seek counsel from a major historian (and no need for a french one, I'm sure Harvard, Princeton or Yale are full of amazing teachers more than willing to help!). So, this could be fun if it was a parody, or a teenage movie, or even a cinema version of Saved By The Bell, but we are legitimately waiting for something more convincing or more accurate considering the topic. We are very far from the taste of, let's say, Kubrick in Barry Lyndon, and I see no genius in her direction, so what is the point to waste time watching this? Last of all, the rock soundtrack on 18th century french history is less than a poor choice, it is idiotic. Please, if you still really want to see it, don't watch this movie in order to learn more about Louis XVIth and Marie-Antoinette, you have unfortunately no other choice than to read a good book about it as no movie has treated the subject really convincingly.",1,41,98,27 May 2006
The Mission," Masterpiece
","When I first saw this movie in Cannes film festival, I knew it would get the golden palm, Roland Joffe had already proven his mastery with his excellent 'Killing Fields', but this time, he really reached a state of grace. The acting of Irons and De Niro is OUTSTANDING, the photography is gorgeous, the plot is extremely interesting and profound, I give it an absolute 10, I've seen many movies in my life, and it has never reached such a level of passion and enlightenment. As a conductor, I have also to point out the importance of the soundtrack, how many times I've seen a movie ruined by a poor musical background! But nothing like that here, Morriconne signed one of his best inspired scores. Some people talk about historic inaccuracy, I strongly disagree and I suspect this comment to come from religious zealots; ethnological studies of Claude Levi-Strauss, George Dumezil or Marcel Mauss have mentioned similar historical cases...",10,2,5,29 July 2004
Sin City," total *beep*
","Why should I even bother writing anything about that? Because I'm extremely annoyed of having waisted 1 hour of my time !(I could not make it through the entire thing) And also because I'm extremely worried of the direction Cinema is taking...I remember a time when we valued:-actors' craft (I mean, real actors like Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Max Von Sydow, Marcello Mastroianni, Bruno Ganz, and more recently people like Jeremy Irons, Geoffrey Rush, Robert De Niro etc...),-directors' artistry (real directors like Ingmar Bergman, Francois Truffaud, David Lean, Cohen brothers, Theo Angelopoulos, Wim Wenders, Volker Schlondorff, Jean-Jacques Annaud, Luc Besson, Robert Benton, Roland Joffe, Terence Malick etc...)-Screenwriters or great authors (from Charles Dickens and Jane Austen to Paul Auster, Virginia Woolf or Philip Roth...)-cinematography (Nestor Almendros, Sven Nykvist...), soundtrack (ennio Morriconne, Rachel Portman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Nini Rota...)But maybe all of that is not important, and maybe we can make movies without it: with terrible actors instead, terrible cinematography, terrible directors, terrible stories as long as we put sex and violence in it. And it will become a blockbuster (it is SO important to make money that we tend to forget about making art) and thousands of people will come on IMDb and give the ludicrous vote of 8 out of 10! (they must be kidding; I looked for 0 but the lowest is unfortunately 1! It's already way too much for that s...)If you like cinema as an art, like theatre or classical music and painting, don't watch this. If you prefer entertainment blockbusters, if you hate Shakespeare, if you love techno, rap and other *beep*, if you prefer the painting on your wallpaper rather than any painting by Vermeer or by Monet, you will certainly love it!",1,11,23,13 October 2005
