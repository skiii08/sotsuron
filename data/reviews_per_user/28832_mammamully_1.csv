It," Goonies meets stranger things and fails!
",So I'm not a huge horror movie fan but thought I'd give this one a try. Definitely fell much below expectations. Not sure if I ever saw the original but always knew I'd the scary 'IT' clown. Well this remake didn't scare me at all. It really was like goonies meets stranger things. There was really no suspense or surprises. Very juvenile and seemed to appeal toward pre teen:teen audience. The kids acting was fine but just not very entertaining for an adult audience. Kinda disappointed to say the least.,4,3,6,26 July 2018
