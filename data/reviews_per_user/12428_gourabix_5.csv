Ford v Ferrari," A hell of an amazing ride
","There's very few movies out there that can touch the bar that's set back by Ford v Ferrari. And sometimes in life, words are not that useful anymore.I'll not even try to review this title technically.This is one of the best movies of the 2010's decade. Loved every minute of it. And everyone, irrespective of sports / racing fans, would be remiss if they miss this title.Well done, James Mangold, Christian Bale & Matt Damon! Hats off to you.",10,1,1,9 February 2020
Divergent," High octane sci-fi movie with some rough edges
","The concept & the main theme that this movie's ideological foundation is based upon, is catchy. It's good and relatable in the present time. I watched this movie just on whims, I hadn't heard about this movie. This just popped on my 'Recommended' list and I gave it a chance.The characters are fleshed-out and the cast does a stellar job of portraying them. Although it felt like Caleb's character was severely underused. It's a shame in that department, really. Al is another character that doesn't match up with the plot and feels underused. It almost felt like there are missing scenes that have been cut that could've developed Al's character in the movie that would finally line up with the movie's plot. And one last thing that I'd like to just lay out there is that Andrew Prior's fate seemed extremely forced and for the sake of plot convenience. Like Tris didn't even bat an eye to what happened. It's as if she's in a sim, not the others. Again, felt like missing scenes, & felt like the director was in a hurry to finish the film.It's a very satisfying sci-fi action movie. The plot is linear, but very enjoyable and relatable. It sets up a sci-fi franchise tactfully, and maintains it's tight action plot up until the end. One of the major reasons of what makes this movie good is it's high octane plot.The soundtrack is just awesome at the beginning but after the movie crossed it's intermission it felt 'kinda' forced. Felt like what was going on screen was flowing through the soundtrack, but was off by a bit. Also I felt that cinematography could have been better.In spite of all the criticisms I ranted about, this is a nice watch in the evening with packet of popcorn in hand. Enjoy it, people. It's a nice one.",7,1,1,16 March 2019
Django Unchained," This movie is great but I really didn't like how it was filmed
","Title says it all.This movie is great, make no mistake. The plot's great and there's plenty of action to go along. Couple that with tremendous performances by Jamie Foxx, Leonardo di Caprio and almost everyone else, especially the portrayed slaves you get a gut - wrenching movie that stays with you long after the movie's over.What I didn't like were the camera angles and the bullet invincibility, sheer luck of Jamie Foxx's character. 20+ men shooting a single down with cross-fire couldn't even graze this man. Seemed a bit too much, I think. And the zoomed camera angles. Sure, others might find it nice, I didn't. This was one of the major pain points for me.All in all, a nice movie to be had a good time with. Beware of Gore and graphic content though.",8,0,1,11 January 2020
A Quiet Place," Shh! The thrills are real...
","There are not many movies out there that can get the audience to feel a sympathy for, or to root from deep inside their hearts, or to care about whatever happens to that character or family in that story. This movie does & does so very easily. How? By forcing the audience directly into their world.Even though the amount of dialogue spoken is very less (duh!), you'll still start to care for them. Why? Simply because of the plot execution. And the characters. In the high noise world that we live in, the vision of how to *survive* in a world where even the slightest mechanical hum turns heads (or does it?) feels claustrophobic at first. The sign languages is making something out to be. But you don't understand it. That's creating a tension now. It's frustrating. That's how this movie excels. It forces you to put yourself in that situation & makes you guess what's gonna happen. But most of those guesses don't work out as this movie reveals it's twists & turns along it's length.Sure, this movie doesn't reinvent something. Sure, you don't know how this world came to be. Sure, you don't even know what those monsters are. But do you need to? No. It's designed to be open ended & it ends keeping that symmetry up.A Quiet Place is about love. It's about love that binds a family together. It's about responsibilities that amplifies the power of love to do whatever necessary to protect our loved ones at any cost. It's about how our parents appear strong & happy in front of us, even in their worst of times. It's about not giving in to despair even when life kicks in the guts & the balls. You never know...John Krasinki & Emily Blunt just straight up nailed it with their acting. This movie is one of the best thrillers (horror? Not really.) sandwiched together with a horrifying & cruel world.Overall, it's an awesome experience to be had.",10,0,1,1 March 2019
