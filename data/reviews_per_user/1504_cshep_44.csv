The Rock," Action Thriller of the Highest Caliber !
","Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Director Michael Bay team up for one of the Greatest Action Thriller Movies of All time! On that scale , it gets a 10 ! And deservedly so ! When making films that don't require the viewer to think, but just sit through Top-Rate Action, Explosions, Chase Scenes, then 'The Rock' fires on all cylinders. Mix in some terrific performances John Patrick Mason(Sean Connery) and Stanley Goodspeed(Nicholas Cage) and you have 136 entertaining minutes. Connery and Cage deliver Tour-De-Force performances that you have to see to believe. Connery, after many disappointing films comes shining through with dead pan deliveries and throw away lines that will have you rolling in the aisles. His focus is dead on.As a convicted ex-British Army Military Personnel, Mason is released from prison conditionally to help defeat Gen. Hummel(Ed Harris)and some rogue Marines, who have stolen Hi-Grade Biological military chemical weapons and threatens to use it on the City of San Francisco if his extortion demands are not met.Cage and Connery are frick and frack. Cage the out of the water Bio-Tech FBI Agent, and Connery the wily veteran who wants only to escape, and reunite with his daughter.To defeat the General, they must go to Alcatraz Island(The Rock), kill the General and his men, disarm the weapons, and release the hostages. Almost non-stop action once on the 'Rock.' Top-Notch !This film is highly addictive and infectious. Hard to stop watching once you start.Gets a 10 for what it does, provide 136 minutes of thrills and adventure. Doesn't require the viewer to think. Just enjoy...",10,1,1,31 July 2010
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Funny movie, Heart warming, Human .
","Simon Pegg has established himself as a very capable screen writer, comic actor, but now adds a depth of tenderness and compassion to his body of work. Compares favorably to James Woods, in scope and screen ability.Dennis(Simon Pegg), engaged to Libby(Thandie Newton), gets froze toes , literally, minutes before the wedding ceremony, bolts out the window, leaving his pregnant fiancé', crying in the street.A few years later, and Dennis is now a security agent in a woman's clothing store in London, and going nowhere. Libby, trying to reestablish her life, meets and is wooed by Whit(Hank Azaria) , who is more than a match to defeat Dennis, for the attentions of Libby.David Schwimmer ably directs this light hearted romp of human emotions with a gentle touch, allowing the emotions and scenes to develop nicely and move on to the the next, in a smooth orderly fashion. Good Job !!!Thaddie Newton sparkles and is delightful as the jilted girlfriend ,who runs a pastry shop, and devotes the rest of her time to her young son.Plenty of secondary actors to fill in the gaps, including Cousin Gordon (Dylan Moran) , whose casual view of life is interesting, and funny , maybe crude. The ending is realistic and touching and completes the film ! Enjoy ! It is an 8 . Not for Super High moments ,but for a steady run of Real Human Emotions .",8,2,5,1 April 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Muddled Script With Poor Direction
","When out of ideas throw whatever is leftover from the Pirate era, including the Fountain of Youth, Mermaids,Penelope Cruz and Judi Dench.What were they thinking , only about the 'Benjamins.'Johhny Depp recreates for the 4th and hopefully the final time Jack Sparrow ,the displaced Captain of the ill-fated Black Peral, that actually makes a cameo. The lovely and very talented Penelope Cruz is mostly wasted as the daughter of Captain Blackbeard ,Angelica Teach. Captain Blackbeard(Ian McShane) is nothing more than a twisted evil anachronism with no redeeming qualities, really. So while on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth, they encounter mermaids,2 silver chalices on a poorly placed pirate ship and some chases and more dribble. So that's about it. Pass. 5 star out of 10. Geoffrey Rush also returns as Captain Barbarossa for another paycheck. AArrrrr...",5,1,1,24 September 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Vast Improvement on 2003 Hulk !
","When you think of Invincible, you think of Iron Man, when you say Incredible, it has to be the 'HULK!' And this film, pretty much achieves that goal, with a few less than credible moments .Bruce Banner(Edward Norton) is now in Brazil, trying to reverse the effects of the original experiment that left him filled with Gamma rich blood. Gen. Thunderbolt Ross(William Hurt) is on the prowl to find him, and eventually locates him. and sends a small detachment, including Emil Blonsky(Tim Roth), a veteran British soldier who loves the excitement of Battle ! Banner escapes and returns to Virginia, to enlist the aid of Mr. Blue, an unknown internet connection whom is trying to help find the 'Cure.'As fate would have it, he runs into his old flame Elizabeth (Betty) Ross, (Liv Tyler), scientist, and daughter of the General.Now injected with an experimental drug,Blonsky aims to become a Super Soldier, and the pursuit of the Hulk begins again.Needless to say, the transformation doesn't become complete until Blonsky meets up with Mr. Blue, and this is when the Abomination becomes incarnate. The battle scenes are Terrific, with breathtaking action almost non stop for about the last 20 minutes of the film. While CGI still isn't where it will be, these creatures are Real enough to provide the punch necessary to deliver a Big Emotional Wallop.So, while this incarnation of this composite Hulk film, pays tribute to past Banners(Bill Bixby) and Hulks( Lou Ferrigno), it can stand on its own as a testimony to the power of the emergence, of man,Director Louis Leterier and computer , to produce an entertaining comic book on film. 8 out of 10. Runtime 114 minutes.",8,3,5,17 June 2008
Miracle," Classic Retelling of an Actual Event !!! A Brilliant Film !!!
","'Do You Believe in Miracles ?' is an immortalized phrase describing the winning over the Soviet Professional Hockey Team by a group of Unknowns on the 1980 USA's Hockey Team !! Well that phrase can now be applied to this movie directed by Gavin O'Conner !!!The plot of the film shows events prior to the 1980 Olympics, and the growth of the individuals involved !!! Herb Brooks(Kurt Russell) must put together a competitive hockey team to represent USA in the 1980 Olympics. He has 7 months to select , condition and mold a competitive team, and all he has to work with are are a bunch of prima donas with some talent from the college hockey ranks, more interested in themselves and the skirts in the stands. Brooks realizing his team has no focus and little chemistry,and little chance of winning, runs the line drills, where the players skate back to the other blue line and back, red line and back, and then the far blue line and back at full speed, until they are exhausted !!! The word 'Again' takes on a whole new dimension !!! The players soon get the message and start to focus on playing at an Olympic level !!!Brooks has several trials, personal growth and complex internal arguments,as he has to reduce the 26 man roster to 20 players. Brooks, the victim of the final roster cut, from the 1960 Olympic Hockey team, is all too aware of the pain of the final 'Cut.'The USA's Hockey Team slowly emerges to become one of quality, but lose some of their confidence after playing the Soviet Professional Team in an Exhibition at Madison Square Garden , shortly before the Olympics start at Lake Placid.That being said the rest is History !!! The Team of Director O'Conner, Editor John Gilroy, and Cinematographer Dan Stoloff take you onto the ICE and INTO the GAME !The last 30 minutes of non-stop action and furious skating are the BEST I've EVER seen !!! As good as the GAME itself !!!Kurt Russell delivers an Academy Award worthy performance as Herb Brooks !!! Russell has always been underrated for his body of work, but this separates the men from the boys !!!So if you need a 'Miracle ' in your life, start with this one, as good as a life changing film as you will ever see !!!Rated a 10 !!!",10,1,1,5 August 2005
The Hangover," Very Funny Comedy ! Above Average Buddy Fare !
","Deftly directed by Todd Philips, 'The Hangover', four friends go to Vegas for a one nite bachelor fling, and end up trying to remember the missing 12 hours, and what happened to their friend Doug.Buddy films come and go, but mostly go, what makes this vehicle work are the story telling, some in flashback form, video and first -person accounts. Subtley hilarious are the way the story unfolds, somewhat like a good mystery, with hilarious twists and turns at every corner. Phil Wenneck(Bradley Cooper), the teacher and voice of reason, who constantly urges his comrades into committing outrageous and stupid acts.Stu Price (Ed Helms) dentist who wants to be called 'DR.',involved in a no-win relationship where his is totally subservient and repressed.Alan Garner(Zach Galifianakis) as the left of center of Forrest Gump, who lives in a somewhat distorted reality. Doug Billings(Justin Bartha) groom to be who disappears, and becomes the central focus of the film.Each character plays off each other extremely well, and makes for a very funny and pleasing film.Trying to recover the missing time-line , each clue leads to plots twists galore ! There is one question that is never resolved, where did the 'chicken' come from ? Enjoy ! Adult humor !",9,1,3,30 June 2009
Star Trek," WOW! and What ?
","Well, if you wanted a NEW Star Trek Generation, then you have it ! Not since DC Comics invented the Alternate Universe theory, and all of the problems it created, we have the same dilemma, just a film away. While this Star Trek creates a new time-line, it gets really complicated, because it invalidates ALLOT of what you saw on the TV show. Bad guy Nero(Eric Bana) in an intimidating performance, wants to get revenge for the destruction of his Romulan planet, due to a solar blast. Now it really gets weird, the original Spock was on his way to stop the solar explosion, and I think he succeeds, because he creates a black hole in order to stop planet Romulus from being erased, but this creates a black hole in which Spock and Nero and crew get taken back thru time.. But , apparently Nero doesn't get the message and goes on a killing spree, destroying Federation Starships at will, and also Planet Vulcan, and another 6 Billion Vulcans, this takes place in the past or current day storyline. Those are the only spoilers I am going to reveal. The film stands on its on merits, and the acting is quite good. Chris Pine as James Kirk, and Zachary Quinto as young Spock are quite admirable.Simon Pegg is a hoot as Scotty. The story is only o.k. if you are a fan of the original TV and films. If you are a new comer, you will be more likely to accept the premises that are now the new time-line. I enjoyed the special effects, and the galactic approach to its(the films producers) thinking. Very big on scope ! But, the rest is in the hands of the Trekkie's to either embrace or ignore the new story lines, only time will tell. With ALL of the plot holes, I can't see how the storyline will hold up, it can't support its own weight. I gave the film a 9 on overall effort, not for the inevitable downfall.",9,2,8,19 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Robot Heaven vs. Iron Man !
","Jon Favreau directs this terrific sequel with style and command.Robert Downey Jr. recreates his role of Tony Stark, military industrialist whose identity as Iron Man, invades every aspect of his life.Also returning are Gwennyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Jon Favreau as 'Happy' Hairston ,chauffer and bodyguard to Tony Stark.The film centers around Russian Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke) whose father was a scientist that worked with Howard Stark, Tonys father.In order to gain revenge for his fathers alleged betrayal by Stark the elder, he designs his own version of an 'Iron Man', and attempts to even the score. He is initially defeated, but subsequently released from jail under the pretense of his death by a bombing, by competitor to Stark Industries, Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell).All of the characters carry their own very well, and the culmination of overlapping sub-plots combine for a terrific showdown.If you like robots, you will love 'Iron Man 2.'Fantastic special effects, a good script with fine direction, and more than capable actors add up for a great time. Never a dull moment with this grouping.I gave this an 8 out of 10 . Runs about 2 hours and 5 minutes.Looks like the coming of 'Thor' is next. Look for the teaser after the closing credits.",8,1,2,29 June 2010
Hot Fuzz," Sandford, What Happens in Sandford , STAYS in Sandford!!! Well, maybe not....
","When Director Edgar Wright failed to satisfy viewers in 'Shaun of The Dead', he COMPLETELY finishes 'HOT FUZZ' with mustard, relish, and ALLOT of Energy .Remember this name, 'CHRIS DICKENS', he should win for Academy Award for BEST EDITOR 'Hands Down!!!' If you want to see an expert at work , then study this film as a terrific work of ART !!!Nick Angel(Simon Pegg), reassigned to Sandford from merry Ol' London England, for his OVER achieving ways, uncovers a sinister under element at work in this sleepy, but cheery little town. Befriending Danny Butterman(Nick Frost) a local patrol cop, they team to deal with menial but necessary misdeeds in the community. But, as fate has it, a mystery starts to unfolds as some of the towns members turn up dead, horribly dead .Danny, the antithesis of Nick Angel, yearns to be the Clint Eastwood of England . Using every tool of his keen ways, Nick probes the area until the case breaks wide open .The relationship between Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost is DEEPLY fleshed, and NOT just the superficial work you might find in a cop/buddy movie.Director Wright throws many curves and twists to keep the viewer off balance, many chases and allot of BELLY laughs to keep the Energy High .This film melds into a combination of Point Break,Dirty Harry, The Good , Bad, and the Ugly , with a terrific gun fight in the main square . There were a few English humour moments that went over my head, and some of the words were unintelligible, not intentionally.I hope to see more of the team of the top 2 stars , Pegg and Frost. Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward also star !!! Some blood, some violence . Lots of Guns !!! Film suited for audiences 16 and older !!! But, this is a VERY FUN FILM, Heartfelt! excellently directed,good sound track, and BRILLIANTLY edited !!! So , if you are looking for a great time, check this film in . High Energy, and Wonderful Moments that Add Up !!! A 10!!! Runs about 2 hours.",10,1,3,24 April 2007
Ed Wood," A Lovely Touching Film for All of the Wood-be film makers out there ....
","A man's reach exceeds his grasp !!!Ed Wood, while not commercially successful in life, found his greatness in compassion. and the ability to overcome great difficulties.Tim Burton's opus to all of the wood-be filmmakers, pun intended.Terrific music and screen play high-lite this tribute to anyone who has dreams ! Enter Ed Wood, a struggling play writer, who has a fetish for Angora sweaters. His life long ambition , is to tell stories, in whatever format that suits his purpose. Well, as fate would have it, a chance encounter with Bela Lugosi, a man whose life is tormented by his drug addiction, and an opportunity to actually direct a low budget movie, ' I Changed My Sex, or Glen or Glenda' a take-off of the then current day tale of Christen Jorgensen, the first man to change his sex thru surgery. The movie displays , with great charm and heart, the missing attributes from ED's films, that he had in life. The story centers on the friendship, between Ed Wood, and the legendary actor , Bela Lugosi, and what a ride it is. Scene after scene takes us through the revolving doors of show business, and the endless steps to produce and\or direct a movie. A terrific script by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, elevated by the performances of Bela Lugosi(Martin Landau), Ed Wood Jr.(Johnny Depp), Bunny Breckinridge(Bill Murray) , Dolores Fuller(Sarah Jessica Parker),and lovingly directed by Tim Burton, all worthy of Academy nominations. A True American Classic.Trivia, one of life's ironies is near the end of the movie when the conversation between Orson Welles telling Ed Wood of his difficulty to finance a movie of Don Quixote. In real life a few years after this movie, of an attempt by Director Terry Gilliam to film Don Quixote starring Johnny Depp. The movie was never completed because of internal problems with missing actors and technical difficulties in the filming locations . Essentially, the film ran out of money . Wow, how about real life imitating art . Spooky !",10,2,2,20 October 2004
500 Days of Summer," Terrific and Wonderful Film About Men and Women Relationships !!!
","This is truly a wonderful and deeply moving film that explores the budding relationship of Summer(Zooey Dechannel) and Tom(Joseph Gordon-Levitt).Tom Hansen,LA greeting card designer and wanna be architect is cruising thru life and is waiting for that 'one' girl , that will make his life complete ,enter Summer Finn. Lovely and talented Zooey Deschannel brushes into Tom's wide-eyed optimistic life and the roller coaster ride ensues. Shown in flash forward, flashback, and flash-sideways , each day is numbered,you would think that it would distract from the film, but it is held together beautifully by first time Director Marc Webb. He artfully crafts a fine film by showing the simple times that lead to complex relationships. Well done !!! Pay special attention to the early childhood setup, this will help you to understand the ending. Summer appears to be a care-free woman, but her character is complex, due to lack of functional parental relationship and lack of structure.There is an impromptu musical dance number that defies description, what a moment ! Chloe Moretz as Rachael Hansen is just a delight, along with the rest of this talented cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an Oscar worthy performance, as the smitten would-be boyfriend, who wants a deep relationship and has to battle the realities of the world. Worth multiple viewings, and what could be considered a chick flick, really appeals to both sexes. The time honored tradition of trying to understand the opposite sex. I gave it a TEN, it is a perfect film, on may levels. Bittersweet, well maybe. I will give you a hit, Summer does love Tom, but , well, you have to see the film. One hour and 35 terrific minutes. A Slice of Heaven.",10,1,2,4 August 2009
Cloverfield," Cloverfield or The Monster From New York.Who Ate Your Money
","With the exception of the last 20 minutes of film, this movie is a complete waste of time. Over-hyped as a 'Blair Witch' clone, told in a hand held jittery camera fashion, enough to give you motion sickness, Cloverfield is full of sizzle but not much substance.Filled with 5 stereotypes, the obstinate counter culture Rob Hawkins(Michael-Stahl David), Jason Hawkins(Mike Vogel), the hot chicks, Lily Ford(Jessica Lucas) and Marlena Diamond(Lizzy Caplan) along with Hudson Platt(T. J. Miller) .No explanations given as to why the creature(s) are there and why destruction seems to be their number 1 objective.New York doesn't need more monsters, just a good story without fabricated teaser scenes. Save your time and money and find a better film to watch. 1 star.",1,3,4,19 September 2010
Burn After Reading," Wonderfully Funny ! Satire on Being Stupid!
","Take a circle of people , who have more in common than they know, who are generally unaware of the people directly affecting their lives, and you have a 'Wonderfully funny' film, about people being Stupid !Osbone Cox(John Malkovich) is being reassigned in a federal government position, yet he rebuffs his supervisors and quits. His wife Katie Cox(Tilda Swinden) is having an affair with womanizer Harry Pfarar(George Clooney), who beds no less than 4 women in this film.Osborne is being divorced, unknown to him, and his wife has been gathering personal info , including his memoirs in government life to a CD. The CD is found in the Hard Bodies gym, by the personnel there, so Chad Feldheimer(Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzki(France McDormand ) decide to capitalize on this after discovering some of the contents, and mistakenly coming to the conclusion that they might contain 'Valuable' secrets. So , the farce is on, and what an interesting and entertaining look into human nature it is ! George Clooney is GREAT as Harry, the somewhat paranoid Treasury Agent, who life is unwinding with every step he takes. John Malkovich turns in another solid performance as the repressed Government worker, who keeps getting kicked around while following all of the rules. The final 20 minutes are classic, not to be missed. Terrific cast, the Coen brother turn in a COMPLETE film this time, with an ending not to be missed. Have a Great time ! 8.5 on the scale !",8,2,6,2 October 2008
Apocalypse Now," Classic ! Testimony to the Insanity of War ! Not the Redux version !
","For everyone who knows of War, but has never felt or tasted its affects, then this film is REQUIRED viewing ! From the Heart of Darkness comes 'Apocalypse Now!' A truly visionary film , about the realities, and insanities that take place , inside the Red Zone of war.The time is mid to late 1960's and the War in Vietnam is near its height of escalation, Capt. Willard is assigned to go to Cambodia, and assassinate Gen/Col. Walt Kurtz(Marlon Brando), a combat veteran who has become an embarrassment to the U.S., because he has gone insane, and is conducting his OWN war. When Joseph Conrad wrote his book, it was originally to take place in the Congo of Africa, under different circumstances. Coppala reassigns the action to Southeast Asia, under dubious circumstances, and uses the Vietnam War as the backdrop for this insane asylum.Capt. Benjamin Willard(Martin Sheen) is brilliant as the subdued young soldier, struggling with his own demons, as he tries to justify his mission of assassination.Each sequence has its own reality, and the deeper they go up the river, the farther they remove themselves from civilized thinking , and the gray area between right and wrong, and moral justification, wow !Truly amazing, each character has their own way of dealing with the daily horrors they face, and the viewer is drawn in with them, what a film ! From Col. Kilgore to Col. Kurtz, they all show the affects of the horrors of war, whether they recognize it , or not !Beautifully framed and photographed, Coppala connects on a deep and personal level, about the value of life, and man's mortality.This is one of the most visceral and moving films, not for the squeamish. I do not recommend the Redux version, it is not the same film. It does not remove you from civilized society like the original release, this is one time a director should not have final cut.Dark and moody, you get a real feel for the soldiers and their families , that fought in Vietnam. The feeling of isolation and hopelessness, and abandonment !Dennis Hopper is the reporter who embraces the view of Kurtz, and is terrific. Required viewing , for everyone on how not to fight a war, our enemies ARE watching. Watch the Original release before viewing the bastardized version Redux, you won't be disappointed.I gave the original a 10, !No faults, it does have 4 endings, but I have as yet to know of their release.",10,1,3,25 May 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," Not Recommended for Children! Contains Porpaganda !
","This film has more to do with indoctrination than entertainment. Not recommended for children, without being viewed by intelligent Adults first. Subtle hints and outright material for sub-culture enthusiasts. I would recommend 'the Incrediblies' or 'Madagascar' before this kind of tripe.Most children films are for entertainment or learning purposes, but this film borders on influencing children to ways other than the way most families operate.So, if you are looking for clean family fun , most Disney or Pixar films will do nicely, this film does not.",1,3,17,27 September 2009
No Country for Old Men," 90 % a Good Movie, and then, There is a Non-Ending...... I gave it an 8...
","The Coen Bros. who have a fine body of work, do a Good job of presenting Good vs. Evil, in ' No Country For Old Men.' The main message of the film seems to be that Good and Evil have no purely defined path or motivation, and they have more common interests than differences, interesting, but NO, that is simply not true. Based on a novel by Cormac MeCarthy, the story centers around a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert, and stumbled upon by Llewlyn Moss(Josh Brolin). He tracks down the theoretical last man standing,(the one who carries the money away), that person is found dead, with $2 Million dollars. Not one to turn down his new found wealth, he takes the buckaroos and goes back to the trailer court where he lives with his wife.Feeling guilt by not assisting one of the dying drug dealers, he returns in the dark of the evening to give him water, only to find himself being hunted down by more henchmen. He escapes, but the money men hire a psychopath,Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem), to recover the $2 Million , in his own way. Of course he kills people at random, anyone who he chooses to ,sometimes by the flip of a coin, as if he has no will of his own. He is just a regular killing machine, and he has a unique(plot device) way of doing it. So , you have two story lines going, and then enter a third story line,Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter sent by the money men to stop Anton Chigurh. Needless to say, the hunter becomes the hunted. The film moves at a nice pace, the music score kept to a minimum, with regular sounds , ramping up the creepiness... The performances are solid by the top 3, Javier, Tommy Lee, and especially Josh Brolin, who has really developed into a top flight Actor!!!The major flaw of the film is similar , believe it or not to 'Smokey and the Bandit', the two main protagonists, do not meet, and without conflict, there is no resolution. And finally, at the very end where Tommy Lee Jones is rambling on about his 2 dreams, the film cuts to the credits, hummmm, what is wrong with this ?, NO Resolution.. Yes, this does mirror life, but I like my films , like a good cup of coffee, you know that it will end with some satisfaction.... It is 90% a good film, but doesn't satisfy....Maybe the DVD will have 4 endings , like 'Apocalypse Now.', at least you would have a choice...There is also the premise in the film that ,most cops are not hip, and that they don't connect the dots, I found that somewhat insulting, because with all of the murder and mayhem, that scenario is very unlikely.... So, if you like a film with no resolution, or non-ending then you should see it, but don't expect fireworks, just a good, tense thriller with an undefined ending, like math,you can't divide by zero....",8,9,18,13 February 2008
Batman Begins," Why ?
","Warner Brothers in it's inestimable judgment, has now recreated the 'Batman' character 5 times ? In this latest installment, we now travel into Batman's psyche, again, but this time , we go to the other-side of the world, to learn of his training, and motivation?, to understand the criminal mind !! How exciting, for fans who have never seen the other 4 installments !!! Beautifully photographed in the mountains of Iceland, which is the backdrop for some Oriental sanctuary, Bruce Wayne(Chritian Bale), begins his training by Master Ducard(Liam Neeson), to purge his fear,and become invincible against all evil, had enough ? Qui-Gon, uh ER, Liam Neeson is one tough dude, TOO tough, and Bruce decides to bolt, but not before destroying the sanctuary ,and saving Master Ducard from certain death!! Bruce returns to Gotham as a changed man, and decides to dedicate himself against the forces of evil , by creating an image, the image of a BAT !!! Being the son of a millionaire has it's perks, and he finds resources even he didn't know about, in the bowels of the Wayne Science Labs, enter Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman), a trusted and invaluable employee,but definitely overlooked !!!Anyway, Batman becomes a living and breathing entity, he beats one of the bad bosses Carmine Falcone, a mob overlord, kicks the drug lord in the Butt, and then must confront the REAL top dog bad guy, plot twist...WOW !!!In between, he puts up a front as a PLAYBOY, to convince the public he is superficial, saves Rachel Dawes D.A.,(Katie Holmes) from more bad guys , and in the end ,a climatic fight with the SUPER DUPER bad Guy on the El Train !!! Not a bad film, but just forget about the first 3 or 4 Batman films and start all over ,AGAIN !!!O yeah, there is also a car chase scene, with lots and lots of destruction and more destruction !!!I guess the Batman franchise is becoming generational, like Disney films, in another 7 years, we can do it all over again !!!If you like a darker Batman, then this one is for you !! Michael Caine gives a Jaws 4 performance, I guess even he is bored with acting and special effects !!! Maybe he is looking forward to Jaws 5, or a remake of Hannah and Her Sisters ? Whatever....The directing is good, but whatever, see it in IMAX, at least the characters are more interesting 40 feet tall.....",5,3,6,13 July 2005
Liar Liar," Brilliant Carrey Performance, Very Funny Movie !!!
","Only the talents of Jim Carrey could make this film work!!!Attorney Fetcher Reede(Jim Carrey) is the walking epitome of unconscionable prevarication..and who could be saved by the Love of his Son, Max, whose birthday wish , causes Carrey to tell the truth for a 24 hour period.This creates hilarious havoc and chaotic situations, that evoke Carreys better character to come thru !!!Well written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, Director Tom Shadyac delivers a VERY Funny film, that captures your heart , after rolling you over with side splitting humor, that hits you at many levels !!!Highly Recommended , Jim Carrey's Tour DE Force Performance !!Great Supporting Cast: Maura Tierney, Cary Elwes, Swoosie Kurtz,Justin Cooper,Jason Bernard,Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilley,Amanda Donohoe, Cheri Oteri , All Terrific !!!Four words you will never forget...'The Pen is BLUE!!!'",9,0,1,15 November 2004
Ghost Rider," Morality Tale With Very Good Special Effects in Comic Book Form !, but lacks intensity !
","From the confines of Marvel Comics comes the Tale of the Ghost Rider ! A young stunt driver in order to save his father from cancer, makes a pact with the Devil with tragic consequences . Taken from a form of Greek tragedy, with a no win situation ,Johnny Blaze(Nicholas Cage) becomes the Ghost Rider , at night or in the shadows when Evil is near ! O.K., so now we know some of the movie rules, on to the film.Mephistopheles( Peter Fonda), takes control of the life of young Johnny Blaze(Matt Long), to use at a later date.Years later, stunt driver Cage, who survives accidents et. al, meets up with his former love interest, Reporter Roxanne Simpson(Eva Mendes), whom he considers a positive sign that would give him a second chance in life...Could be...Bad guys have surfaced from the Underworld , in this case demons ,Blackheart( Wes Bentley) has designs on recovering a stolen document that would give him control over a thousand souls, something of a down payment to get him started in taking over the entire world. His three cohorts, Gressil(Laurence Breuls), Wallow(Daniel Frederiksen), and Abigor(Mathew Wilkenson), each with their own unique power, take on the Ghost Rider for supremacy. This is when Blaze first turns into the Flaming Skulled Ghost Rider, plus Flaming Chopper . That being aside, Ghost Rider makes for an somewhat interesting and entertaining film, on a comic book level, this is NOT Shakespeare...The biggest drawback of the film is it's inability to take the tension to the next level . But, the computer generated effects make up for some of that .There is absolutely NO chemistry between the love interests, Eva Mendes and Nicholas Cage.....So , throw in the mysterious Caretaker(Sam Elliott), and CGI effects, and the underplayed Johnny Blaze, and you have a FUN film, don't think it through..Beware of the 'Penitant Stare !!!' I gave it a 6.5 to 7 out of 10, not Ben Hur, but worthwhile mind juice....Recommended for ages 8 thru 14,it's a comic guy thing...",7,14,23,21 February 2007

The Mist," Should Be Retitled 'The Missed ' or ' Miss This Film '
","If you have absolutely nothing to do for 2 hours and 7 minutes, then go watch '1408', or whatever your favorite thing is to do !!!This film is a complete WASTE of time !!! Poorly crafted by Frank Darabont and overseen by the watchful eye of Stephen King and , who should stick to writing, and leave film making to the few skilled people who know how to put a film together, checkout '1408', that was a terrific film, this one isn't....Once again we are whisked away to Maine, how original, to the Draytons, who house overlooks the lake, and after an overnight storm , is it related to the story ?, I don't know, I didn't read the book , but the storyline doesn't tie it in !!!, a mysterious 'MIST' appears...OOOOOOOooooo, almost sounds interesting, it gets worse, so Mr. Drayton(Thomas Jane), and son, and neighbor, go to town for supplies, and then the 'MIST' , overtakes the town, and WEIRD things happen, people run away from it, and people go into it, and they disappear,Screaming, sometimes... the lack of tension is at an all time high, we are stuck in the store for over half the film, with of course, an overly religious person, acting Totally weird and stereotyped, about the last days and other garbage, I thought I was watching an episode of the X-Files....anyway, the people trapped inside the 'Foodhouse', take sides, ones that say they have the divine 'MORAL' authority, and the ones who appear more rational...boring, anyway, CGI tentacles, Giant Bugs, and Giant Spiders are NOT real, or even scary......So , you have been put on notice...The script is totally overwritten, the film 30 minutes too long, maybe even more could have been trimmed...The Chaos Factor, about the lack of the Rule of Law is really lame, and NOT even engaging...you could get more excitement from the film, 'Earth vs. the Spider 'or ' Sound of Thunder', in my opinion....The acting is O.K, even they don't believe this stuff... The whole film looks totally scripted, and not very interesting, including the PREDICTABLE, Twist ending...not a happy one...The only reason I give it a 3 is for an attempt at putting a film together, it really should have gotten a negative number...",3,9,18,4 December 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Unique Retelling of the Battle between the FF and Galactus !!!
","I actually gave the film 8.5, it tells a good story,FANTASTIC special effects, and intergalactic fun !!!The major drawbacks of the film were the marketing, focus, and length.In the original comic story , Galactus was/is a Giant , in scope and power , in the film, just a giant mean cloud. The Silver Surfer was the harbinger, sent to scout planets for Galactus' energy life supply and sustenance.When Kirby drew him that way, it was for a purpose,it gave him an identity, it was the FF that went head to head, not just the Surfer..But , that being said, Director Tim Story does a fine job, with a good script, could have been better, longer and more fulfilling. Sue and Reed are in love and ready to tie the knot, when , enter the' Silver Surfer '! He is preparing the Earth as the next smörgåsbord for Galactus, by creating craters in a certain geometric order around the world, as discovered by Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic(Ian Gruffudd)and also Dr. Doom(Julian McMahon).Enter the U.S. Army who combines forces with the FF and Von Doom, who has since recovered from his last encounter with the FF. And of course., Dr. Doom has his own agenda, getting the surfboard, which has tremendous power, and taking over the world , which is one flaw of the film, because he doesn't realize , Galactus is coming.That would have been a GREAT battle, Dr. Doom vs. Galactus ! Never happened.But ,the emotional bonds between the FF members comes across Strong ,and Heartfelt ! The dangers they face have real consequences, and they are shown. Michael Chiklis is Terrific as the 'Thing',Kirby 's Thing ! The rest of the cast is fine and they work together very well .Sue Storm/Invisible Girl(Jessica Alba),Johnny Storm/Torch( Chris Evans),Alicia Masters( Kerry Washington),Silver Surfer/Norrin Radd voiced by Larry/Lawrence Fishburne, all are excellent . So, if you want thrills , spills,fantasy, love and a worthy intergalactic battle, this 92 minute film is for you . It really should have been 2 hours. Excellent Special effects . But, not a perfect film.The Fantastic Four are FUNtastic !",8,1,2,25 February 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Triumph of The Human Spirit !! 9.5
","Clint Eastwood directs and stars in another movie destined for classic status!!! Taken from the stories of 'Rope Burns'by F. X. OToole, Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman find the triangle is completed by the square of the boxing arena. The complexities of life merge with challenges of the sweet science for Maggie Fitzgerald(Swank) going nowhere in life, whose only release can be found in pugilism. A 31 year old unskilled amateur , Maggie in need of a trainer and manager, pursues Eastwood, who can provide the needed direction. Eastwood finds Maggie, as the lost daughter and champion fighter , that can salvage his life. Scrap-Iron(Morgan Freeman) exorcises his demons, with his symbiotic relationship with Eastwood and Swank.The movie moves along at an even pace, with plenty of emotional highs ,and some lows. Terrific performances by Swank, Eastwood and Freeman , are more than worth the price of admission. Not a true boxing movie, but about life choices, or lack of them, and the sacrifice people are willing to take to achieve them. Terrific direction by Eastwood, takes you to the core of the principle characters, and has you rooting for every punch thrown, a victory for all of us.A must see for everyone who has to make that moment of truth decision !A Triumph of the human spirit ,that you will never forget !!!",Null,4,7,22 February 2005
The Dark Knight," Incredibly Awesome Film Making ! Absolute Anarchy !
","After 2 hours and 32 minutes, what can only be described as an Absolutely Entertaining Blockbuster of Film making ,Director Christopher Nolan delivers an Epic movie ! The Joker, the late (Heath Ledger), as the Archtypical Anarchist, in a performance that can only be described as , well there are no words that can accurately capture this Unique, Inventive, and Captivating Dynamo of the Silver Screen ! The Joker intent on running and profiting on Gotham Citys illegal operations, vows to take on the Batman and eliminate him , and anyone who opposes him ! Batman/Bruce Wayne( Christian Bale), is struggling with his alter ego identity, and considers stepping down from his hero role, and let the up and coming D.A., Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart) , shut the illegal operations, and jail the Biggest of the Criminals. Well, things don't always work out that way, and the Joker declares war on Gotham City.Using every trick in the book, The Joker kills everyone who opposes him, or who he needs as a tool for another victim. There are plot gaps, but this movie is so well made, I'll overlook them, Alfred the Butler(Michael Caine) finally gives the character the the energy he deserves, and it plays very well.Great casting , Great Professional Actors ! Christian Bale gives another good performance, the suit does allot of the work, but he is the Batman !Gary Oldman another fine performance as Jim Gordon. Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) is delightful and easy on the eyes... See it in IMAX if you can, the photography is Breathtaking, in Chicago and Hong Kong, just terrific !More bad people than you can shake a stick at, the Joker manages to blur the line between survival and human decency, but , only for awhile.Warner Brothers will need to find another villain, NO one can equal or surpass Ledger's Manical Joker, which begs the question, who are the losers, all of his fans to be.....This film works, it is a 10 !Limited special effects, maybe George Lucas will get the message....",10,2,5,22 July 2008

Grindhouse," Rip -Roaring Over the Top Fun in these Gore-Fest Dominated Films !!!
","Looking for a Great time ? If you enjoy over the top films with some violence and blood Then these films are for you. 3 hours and 15 minute running time, so make sure you are near the restrooms .Rodriguez and Tarantino team up with a pair of features, dedicated to the 60,s and 70,s Grindhouse movies, that are limited in budget and in their release, and replayed numerous times , going from city to city basically driven overnight.Movie One:Planet Terror deals with present day people, from a small town, being transformed into zombies due to a release of some experimental gas from a nearby military base .Josh Brolin,Rose McGowan,Jeff Fahey, Bruce Willis are just a few of the stars in the schlock infected gore fest, with LOTS of laughs . It is a HOOT.McGowan a dancer(stripper) dissatisfied with her life, tries to leave the small town she feels had limited opportunities. At a nearby military base, gas has escaped that transforms people into flesh eating zombies(vampires). A few of the residents band together to try and stop the onslaught. Get ready for a wild time !!! Whether they succeed or not doesn't matter, it is just a well made film for fans of this nature.Allot of cameos, great dialog. Look for Tom Savini as one of the deputies,a veteran actor in zombie and vampire movies . He gets it REAL GOOD . Previews: Don't miss these during the intermission. Great fun.Movie Two:Death Proof deals with a present day stuntman who has a desire to kill women with his car. Kurt Russell stars as misogynist 'Stuntman Mike.' He stalks women and then runs them down at the nearest opportunity ! This is a Great premise from the gore-fest angle , but Tarantino doesn't completely finish the job .Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson,Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, are 4 of his intended victims, who are traveling through town to look at a 1970's white Dodge Challenger, when you know who shows up.Russell , cast against type plays right into the role and is terrific ! Terrific stunt work by Zoe Bell keeps you on the edge of your seat.All in All an Action Packed Experience.The one flaw, if it is a flaw is the development of the story in Death Proof. The stuntman is played as a vulnerable and human character, and his car changes, which makes it less than super, also, I was thinking there should have been an alternate ending. The final cut was less than I expected from Tarantino, not really a criticism, but he seems to be mellowing.This movie should be viewed more than once, just for its' content, allot to see. I gave it a 9...",9,1,4,11 April 2007
The Fly," Interesting Remake !
","Jeff Goldblum stars as the ill fated scientist, who reach exceeds his grasp into the unknown world of teleportation !Well written script , explores the relationship to reporter Geena Davis, who becomes involved the Jeff ! Intelligent Sci-Fi by David Cronnenberg is multi-dimensional in its look , and thought provoking experiments by science in this new era , and all of its potential !Slow descent of Goldblum, is Frankensteinish ! Even though some of the computer generated graphics have not aged well, there are enough real moments to advance the story and its characters .Abortion issue introduced, plays to the feminists.Highly recommended for all Sci-Fi fans !!",8,1,2,22 November 2004
Thor," Thor(2011) Mighty FX, Not So Special Storyline...
","Thor starts out with terrific action, brief background set-up, and spectacular special effects,but after Thor's(Chris Hemsworth) banishment to Earth , the story gets weak,the action slows down, and there are more set-ups than you can imagine. Although the pacing is good, more Thor action is demanded and necessary.Odin is recovering and incapacitated from betrayal by step-son Loki. Thor is on Earth , and Loki seizes the opportunity to become King,which had originally to have been Thors birthright.Kenneth Branagh directs, and does a good job ,treating Thor as Henry V, many trials and tribulations. This helps give the character depth and realism. Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) is fine as the earthly love interest . In this version of Marvel comics she is a scientific explorer . Finally toward the end of the film , Thor recovers his powers,though a totally unselfish act, and the storyline picks up.One thing of note, MANY artists built the Marvel Franchise, not just the few given credit. As always, Stan Lee gets top billing , but this should not confuse the issue that the Artists drove the comics, not the stories. While Stan Lee may think he is Odin, I can guarantee you he is not. When Jack Kirby couldn't get health insurance due to costs, it was time to say goodbye. Joe Sinnott , another EXTREMELY talented artist was COMPLETELY snubbed by Marvel, and they will never get another dime out of me. I have had enough of their partisan, selfish views, and Stan Lee can rot in Hell., Marvel hell to be sure. 8 out of 10 stars, for showing the world that special effects and a comic-book storyline can drive a film, but it was created by the sweat off of the backs of the ORIGINAL artists. Nuff' said.",8,0,2,18 May 2011
War of the Worlds," Amazing Fantasy Achievement, with Terrorist Implications !!!
","H. G. Wells, whose imagination ran deep before the advent of computers, could NOT have conceived a better attempt to capture his work , than what Director Spielberg has created. George Pal would have Loved it.Ray Ferrier(Tom Cruise), is the Joe six-pack anti-hero, king of his dysfunctional ,but elusive domain. His children daughter Rachel Ferrier(Dakota Fanning), and older son Robbie(Justin Chatwin) are perfectly cast as the modern day survivalist children , caught between extended families. Set in present time New Jersey, Tom's day starts as any other, but after the children arrive for a visit, so does an electric impulse storm, and then chaos .Tom goes to investigate the electric strikes, when the giant tripod creature emerges from below, and starts disintegrating the population !The chase is on for sanctuary , and Cruise nabs one of the few working vehicles to get out of town.Spielberg pacing is superb, and he carefully selects, each temporary reality, and I mean temporary . He also never lets you get TOO comfortable with your surroundings, because you never know what is below your feet or if it is day or night.Huamnity is demoted to it's lowest level, with each passing attack, Survival Mode . With the Tripod creatures running amok, safety is difficult to come by and the Ferrier family runs into refugees and eventually becomes one with the masses ! Spielberg evolves the Tripod creatures subtly,as they extricate themselves from the Earth, and the dirt subtly drops back to the ground.Then the Tripod machines whirl and wind up the life from inside, and howl a booming eerie sound, as they stretch for the sky. Just Terrific . The killing starts just after the sound, similar to a Pavlavin experiment, just with death as the substitute .Tripods inherit the Earth, and extinguish life wherever they pop up from .This is not a War, but annihilation . Conventional weapons have no effect against the Tripod creatures and their protective shield .Dakota Fanning metaphors innocence and Justin Chatwin is the fiery adolescent who has estranged feelings for his father , but wants to fight the creatures under any circumstances . Part of the essence of this film explores each person's perception of reality, and how easy it is to change , for better or for worse .Terrific in it's scope, this is not a perfect film, but the few flaws are ignored by the suspension of disbelief, sci-fi fans take with them when they buy the tickets.The terrorist implications are parallel because some of the prevailing thinking is that they may already be here .There is one classic scene when Cruise opens the door from the house where he had taken refuge on a battle scene, and discovers that the Aliens are reinventing the topography to their way of life, but it is also close to Dorothy opening the door to Munchkinland from the Wizard of Oz, clever .All in all, a GREAT effort from Team Spielberg, but you would have thought, if the Aliens were so advanced to place weapons of destruction in place for colonization, they might have thought about vaccine ?Also look for Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, the two main stars of the original WOTW.Also, in the ending statement, you will find that this paradox also answers the question posed in the 1950's film, 'The Incredible Shrinking Man .",9,0,5,19 July 2005
Army of Darkness," Actually a 7.5 for Campy Humor and Allot of Fun !!!
","Not having seen Evil Dead movies, in any form, up pops Bruce Campbell vs. the Army of Darkness, a quirky , off beat , campy film of the Fantasy genre, that pins Bruce against the evil forces, in a medieval setting, not at his discretion....I can only imagine that when Sam Raimi, Director and co-script writer, and Bruce Campbell got together, they were both on the same page as what kind of movie they wanted to make, and they did a fine job of it.Ash(Bruce Campbell) gets transported from present time to 1300 A.D. for trying to read prohibited material about the undead . Thought to be a prophet, he becomes the love interest of Sheila(Embeth Davidtz), and must recover the Necomicron(a book of the dead), to return home. Not the brightest bulb on the tree, he doesn't completely recite the 3, count them 3, little words that he needs to get him home, Klatu Baratta Nicktu, sound familiar ?, yeah, they are from the 1951 film, 'The Day The Earth Stood Still', a science fiction classic. Those words were to be delivered to Gort, the giant robot, after Michael Rennie was shot.Anyway, the battle scenes between the skeletons is where the conflict reaches its' zenith, and it is a most memorable one...The battle scenes are a little uneven because the lack of consistency of the special effects....but Bruce carries the film nicely, and delivers a fine performance .So,if you want to escape reality for about 81 minutes, then you should try this tasty morsel, for your viewing pleasure .Campy fun , for the young at heart !!!",8,2,3,27 January 2008
Scream 2," Intensely VIOLENT !!!
","Well made thriller, with A LOT of violence. Aimed to satire stalker films, but the overkill,numbs the soul. Neve Campbell returns, and Sarah Michelle Gellar joins this bloodfest testimony to Generation Y. Subject matter of killers like 'STAB', is the premise that wears thin, even with stellar cast. This installment takes place at college, a few years after the original, with most of the main characters returning. People are being murdered and Neve seems to be the main target.Empowerment of Women in Crisis situations may work on the screen, but not in real life. After all of the attacks, psychological and physical, One has to wonder about the state of mind of character Sidney Prescott, will she be the next psycho killer ?Inside jokes from Courtney Cox, inserted to make the movie aware of itself, for the FRIENDS crowd. Is there a sequel ? Who cares....",8,0,0,22 November 2004
Jaws," One of the Best Suspense Films of All Time ! 10 out of 10 !
","After 35 years 'Jaws' still ranks as one of the Best Suspense films of ALL time ! Directed by Steven Spielberg and co-written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, music score by John Williams, this film delivers a wallop of thrills, and takes the viewer on a ride they will never forget.Some of the success of the film was really by accident. Mishaps galore caused numerous breakdowns of the multiple 'Bruces', the Great White Turd, as Spielberg so aptly named him. This caused the shark scenes to be filmed last, but Spielberg did a terrific job while waiting for the shark repairs.'Jaws' defines the Summer Blockbuster, and rightfully so. No film had ever made such an impact in the Summer Season until this movie hit the Silver Screen.The 'hidden menace' is a great device to build a story around, because it is lurking just below the conscious and literal surface, and you must be ever vigilant to not be victimized.Benchleys Best Seller is about a rogue Great White Shark who infects the waters of Amity Island with dire consequences. In the mix is Sheriff Brody(Roy Scheider), whose disdain of the water is well documented. Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), denial is his strong suit, until the shark almost bites him in the ass. Sam Quint(Robert Shaw) as the crusty independent ex-navy sailor, whose life is on a crash course with destiny.Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) as the academic marine biologist whose style is 180 degrees of Quint.After a few swimmers are killed by the shark, the town of Amity hires Quint to find and kill him. Brody and Hooper go along for this sea adventure, and it gets intense. So there you have it , Great Director,Actors Script, Music, Score and Story. They all combine for a compelling time, and you will find yourself watching this darn film, over and over.Trivia: watching Richard Dreyfuss bite his lip when asked by Bob Costas if he was ever afraid of the shark, CLASSIC!By the way, there were different sharks used for the many scenes including half of a shark, left and right, even a shark on a dolly.Most of them suffered from mechanical failures.Trivia: The shooting stars overhead of Brody ,and later the boat are REAL. Usually the sign of Good Fortune. Different prints run 124 to 130 minutes.Trivia:Filmed in early spring, so look for allot of long sleeves.Gets a 10 out of 10 for just a Great Time !",10,7,13,12 July 2010

Recommended viewing Several Times !!! Rated a 10 !!! You will not be disappointed !!!George Lucas' real tribute is his contribution to the movie industry in general !! Movie Technology, Special Effects,New Sound Systems and Digital Improvements have raised the BAR very high for all of the studios to follow! Let's see if they can keep up !",10,1,6,24 May 2005
WALL·E," Garbage In, Garbage Out ! Pixar Falls Flat !
","In what can only be described as an almost complete waste of time, except for the expert artistry using CGI, the premise of Wall-E, a garbage robot who falls in love with another robot, stereotypes the future generations as bloated sloth slobs, with little or no ambition, other than to emaciate in a laying down position. The script centers on the voyage of spaceship,700 years removed from Earth as a way of protecting its' exodus , Wall-E hitchhikes a ride on, as his beloved Eve is snatched away. Pretty much meaningless drivel, if you consider the moral of the story is that man is his greatest enemy , and he doesn't have enough sense of that of a robot and a cockroach. I am particularly offended by Pixars under-handed approach to indoctrinate our children with propaganda, and crap. So much for positive values. We should be more like robots and cockroaches. Thank you Pixar for showing us your true colors. Not since Monster vs. Aliens has a film disguised as 'Childrens' entertainment , become so blatantly clear as to its' true secularist message. Screw them. I do not recommend Wall-E, or any other film Pixar makes until I see confirmation of their reversal of position. Film gets a 2. Pure GARBAGE, and WASTE of time , about WASTE.",2,2,15,3 March 2010
The Good Shepherd," Paranoia is Everywhere !!!
","Robert De Niro directs this spy film in an attempt to bring the creation of the CIA into focus. He uses Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) as the central character, a member of the original OSS, an Insider who is an Outsider. The time line is the early 1960's, during the Bay of Pigs invasion, with flashbacks to the 1930's thru the 1950's. Maraget{Clover} Wilson(Anjolina Jolie)is the lover/ wife who is driven into obscurity from the lack of emotional commitment by Edward.His passion to protect and defend the USA drives the family into total dysfunction. The flashbacks are used to establish the development of Edward, as a member of the Skull and Bones from Yale, to his trips into espionage against his own people. The tag line ,who is who, is repeated over and over thru the movie. That is where it fails. Deniro plays this theme so continuously that it becomes comical. Wait till they throw the fiancée' out of the plane, you will be roaring with laughter, as this dramatic point becomes theater!!! I thought it was a HOOT !!!There are other leaps of logic but why tell you all of them. I recommend this movie as a semi spy thriller, and why most actors can't direct. They usually over stimulate the set up that when you get to the high point, the energy is gone.Alec Baldwin actually recreates another role, as he tries to be an FBI agent, remember the Shadow ?The rest of the cast does a workman like job, and De Niro keeps the film moving. Look for De Niro as General Bill Sullivan, and a good performance.So , if you are looking for a Spy-thriller, try 'The 39 Steps' or 'Eye of The Needle', otherwise , wait for the DVD. Only a 4.",4,1,4,10 January 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant Psychological Thriller !!!
","Classic Psycho Drama which attacks the senses and plays mind games with whomever watches it ! Anthony Hopkins(Hannibal Lechter) gives a Tour De Force performance as the ultimate misguided Psychiatrist from Hell, whose ambitions vary from moment to psychotic moment. Lechter known for his exceptional perception,is visited by Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster)a new recruit for the F.B.I., that needs to get Hannibal's insight. Even though Hannibal is incarcerated for most of the movie, you feel that he is in total control. Hannibal gives Clarice clues thru the movie, to solve the 'Buffalo Bill' case, and to help her advance her career and deal with her psychological problems. In effect he becomes her psychiatrist behind bars, interesting. Watch for their third meeting, where Hannibal's head seems to be floating on the reflective glass, really creepy ! Everyone in the movie , from her boss, Scott Glenn(Jack Crawford) to Jame Gumb(Buffalo Bill), is either seeking advancement or control of their own reality, amazing !!!As Clarice gets closer to solving the case, Hannibal escapes, and then things really get out of control !!!Terrific ending in the home of 'Buffalo Bill' will leave you on the edge of your seat !!! Great Directing by Jonathan Demme and OUTSTANDING Editing by Craig McCay, take you into the world of Starling and Lechter, but will not let you totally escape from their presence, not a safe movie !!! There are a few flaws, as to how Lechter gets the pen, or how he knows where to phone Clarice, but they are minor.Ted Levine should have gotten Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, this role could have typecast his career.This movie should be viewed by Adults ONLY !!! I highly recommend 'Silence of the Lambs', Winner of the TOP 5 Academy Awards, only 3rd movie in history to do so !!!",10,3,5,14 March 2005
Tombstone," Surrealistic Retelling of the Old West !
","If you believe in fate, and Hollywoods endings that are completely detached from reality, then this feature is for you ! Kurt Russell shines as Wyatt Earp, retired law enforcement officers, with brothers Virgil(Sam Elliot) and Morgan(Bill Paxton). The gunfight at the OK Corral is dispatched midway of the movie, and then the real story begins.The Earp brothers relocate to Tombstone,AZ. This is where they encounter the 'Cowboys' based on a real life group of thugs, they don't seem to like each other. So , after throwing a chubby faced Billy Bob Thornton out of a local gaming facility, Wyatt decides to run the establishment. 'Doc' Holiday (Val Kilmer) steals the show as the sickly killer, with a sympathetic following. Wyatts ailing wife played by Dana Wheeler-Erickson, is a crutch to Wyatt, whose ambitions outweigh his sense of right and wrong. Enter Dana Delany , how convenient, another portal for Wyatt to take comfort in. As a matter of fact, the movie always has an answer for every situation! But the redeeming factors are the even pace, magnificent cinematography, and excellent acting ! Look for Jason Priestly in a throwaway role, and Charlton Heston in a cameo as a rancher. The movies basic philosophy is that might makes right !So if you are ready to suspend reality, a lot of killing , especially toward the end of the movie, and an unreal dance in the snow, by all means take the afternoon off, and see 'Tombstone', not a great movie, but enjoyable fare with a Hollywood ending ! I give it a 7.5 for overall effort!",8,0,1,1 December 2004
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Tasty Slice of Spain !
","Woody Allen nurtures another fine little film , out of the bosom of Spain, this delightful romp across the heartstrings of 4 people, Vicki(Rebecca Hall), the brunette, the Blond Christina (Scarlett Johannson), Juan Antonio(Javier Bardem)and , the voluptuous Maria Elana(Penelope Cruz), slightly nutty ,is the former wife of Juan Antonio.The film uses a narrator to set up some of the scenes and deals with Mature Themes.A couple of young adult female tourists , Vicky and Christina, traveling to Europe, encounter Juan Antonio , who invites them for an intimate encounter at his home in Oviedo, Spain. They accept,and off we go. The locations are as much a character of this film as the actors. Beautiful locations, filmed on a stringent budget, still shine, as the atmosphere of Spain, seduces the viewer, with it's elegant charm.This is a light hearted comedy, with the usual Woody Allen themes, about people being their own moral universe, and acceptance of homosexual relations or multiple relations. It doesn't try to overwhelm the audience with clever and deep philosophical thought, but provokes by being sublimely bold , such is the way of Europe.I enjoyed this film, quirky, and Scarlet still learning the craft, brings charm and innocence , where Rebecca Hill delivers a more adult way of looking at things. Javier Bardem is the quintessential Europeon lover, exuding charm and subtlety. Fine performances by all. I gave the film an 8 out of 10. Penleope Cruz is , well , you just have to see it for yourself.A pleasant way to spend an afternoon.",8,1,4,3 October 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," One of the Worst Movies of All Time!!
","Peter Jackson's reach exceeded his grasp!!! In what can only be described as one of the greatest Gay fests of all time, LOTR 3 delivers more repetition than all of the disco records combined!! If you've seen one battle seen, you've seen them all!! Mindless subplots,where a corrupt ruler usurps a kingdom, and mercifully jumps over a cliff in flames, describes how many viewers felt , after the first hour and a half of this mess!!! The Academy was one film too late !! Where LOTR 2 delivers a film of considerable achievement, LOTR 3 is the complete opposite !!! Not since 'The Greatest Show on Earth' has a film been this overrated!!! J.R.R. Tolkein must be turning over in his grave, with this double edged sword !!! In what is becoming a trend, the computers are receiving Academy Awards, for carrying movies , that have little merit of their own!!!",1,1,6,1 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Ground Breaking Movie That Carried Us Out of the 20th Century !!!
","During the 70's, what was a period of confusion, after a decade of war,turmoil, and strife, it is ironic that a film about a fictional Galactic Space War, would deliver such a cathartic emotional response !!!This is the legacy of Star Wars, George Lucas' little independent film, that almost no major studio wanted to do....A cast of characters so diverse, the abstraction is a classic !A young warrior wannabe Mark Hamill(Luke Skywalker), the rogue element, Harrison Ford(Hans Solo), a princess, Carrie Fisher(Leia Organa),a Wizard/Jedi Knight,Alec Guiness(Obi-Wan Kenobi),An Ultimate Evil Knight, Darth Vader and eventually the Emporer, and two little Droids,R2-D2, C3PO,comedy relief and the eyes and ears to help us view the movie !!!The Empire has taken over the galaxy, but a small force of rebels refuses to be dominated !!The blueprints for the Death Star, the Empires Super weapon about as big as a small moon, have been stolen by the Rebel Alliance, and are being tracked down by Darth Vader !!!Princess Leia hide the plans in R2D2, and launches them onto the planet Tatooine, hoping they find their way to Obi-Wan Kenobi, a former active Jedi Knight, who used to protect the Old Republic !!!Luke Skywalker,finds the Droids and the plans and attempts to locate Obi-Wan on the planet of Tatooine !!!The Imperial Storm Troopers are on the trail of the Droids, and eliminate all who have come in contact with them !! Lukes' relatives, have been killed by the Storm Troopers,relieving him to explore the cosmos, become a Jedi Knight, help the Rebel Alliance, and free the Galaxy !!!The special effects were so advanced, because it allowed freedom of movement, which was incredibly unique, way ahead of its time !!!Can Luke become a Jedi Knight, will the Empire triumph ?Who is Darth Vader ? Stay tuned thru 2 more sequels, the watch the 3 prequels, all of your questions will be answered!!! A Great Movie for its time, but somewhat dated by the evolution of the same technology that created this film!!! See how it all began, way back in 1977, the highest grossing film of that year !!!",10,4,6,13 June 2005
Fantastic Four," 7.5 on the Comic Book Scale ! Jack Kirby would Approve !!!
","Far be it for me to trash a valiant attempt to bring the 'Worlds Greatest Comic ' to the screen, and Tim Story does a Good job, not Great !Because of the time difference in generations , the alterations in updating the 'Fantastic Four', does NOT take away from their originality and teamwork !!! When Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created this timeless group of four, the rivalry between Reed Richard(Ion Gruffudd) and Victor Von Doom(Julian McMahon) chronicled back to college days, where Doom met with a tragic accident , that scarred his looks, explains the mask.On to the current story, Richards designs an outer space experiment, funded by Von Doom, an extremely successful business tycoon. The experiment goes awry when the cosmic storm arrives sooner than expected, and transforms the occupants in the space station. Sue Storm(Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm(Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm(Michael Chiklis), are all transformed and receive powers after a period of dormancy. Ben Grimm, devastated by his looks, desperately tires to search for a solution to reverse the process, and a return to normalcy.Von Doom, always the opportunist, uses his power to complete Bens transformation, and then to destroy his rivals, the Fantastic Four.The development of the team, and the humanness are carefully conveyed and scripted, so the viewer can relate to their problems, and identify with them, and it works !!!The story never lingers, and the direction is forwardly placed. I enjoyed this film on the New playing field of energetic music and younger themes ! So, if you enjoy comic book fantasy, this is a venue that you probably will want to watch ! I gave it a 7.5 for its' ability to capture the karma of the original Fantastic Four , Kirby would have liked it !!!",7,2,3,2 February 2008
Happy Feet," Propaganda and Misrepresentation !!!
","Normally slamming movies is NOT my thing, but this attempt of mishmash by George Miller crosses the line. A CGI movie about Penguins should be a sure fire hit with the kiddies, but mix in alleged environmental issues,and disjointed scenes and you get 'Happy Feet' !! This boring and misguided effort is truly a work of CRAP .Throw in some big name stars Robin Williams, Hugh Jackman, and Nicole Kidman to name a few, and you begin to see a film equal to the wasting of talent such as the film 'Nothing But Trouble ' .Mumbles(Elijah Wood), is the outcast penguin, who of course is different, can't sing, can dance, and he LOOKS different. Wow !!!So , the village of penguins is being threatened because of a shortage of fish . O.K.., so in order to make himself redeemable, Mumbles sets out to find why the food shortage.The story takes Mumbles thru a series of adventures , one being that he is lunch, but you can't eat the main character, so that is BAD .There are other leaps of logic and untruths sprinkled thru the film, too numerous to mention, but the point is the story is not about 'Happy Feet', it is misguided propaganda that people aren't sensitive to environmental issues ! Duh, yes they are . It is because Governments don't do the will of the people !!!So , watch 'Bambi','Cinderella ', 'Cars','Toy Story 1,2,3' , but skip this crap, even if there is an occasional beautiful scene, not enough to carry the movie. There were a few kids in the audience, but the laughs were very few . I give this film a 1, only because it is on film !",1,3,11,10 January 2007
The Simpsons Movie," It's a 10 !!! Irreverent Humour and Hilarious Hi-Jinxs!!! Not for Kids under 10 !!!
","Just when you think you've seen it all, Here comes the Simpsons Movie and it IS a Blockbuster !!!From the creative minds of Matt Groening and James Brooks, and adroitly Directed by David Silverman, they deliver a Smart, Funny, Irreverently so, and down to earth emotional ties that last a long time !!!From the opening scene of Professor Frinks plane carrying message sign in tow, and Ralph Wiggums nose picking antics on the 20th Century logo, the movie bobs and weaves an interesting and entertaining tale of Homers' venture into over-polluting the Springfield lake with pig feces, to his eventual self-saving return to glory !!! Just terrific , non-stop action, that takes you from the confines of an encased in glass Springfield to the beauty of Alaska and back !!! Smart jokes line the screen, which insures multiple viewings to get them all !!! Itchy and Scratchy set the tone for the opening act in an inter-space cartoon, that has cataclysmic implications, and they do not disappoint!!! You'll laugh so hard you might cry !!! But what the Simpsons Movie truly reveals is the talent and Love behind the scenes, there is a Great Depth and Truth to how the cast combines their creativity and care for each other thru the characters. So D'oh yourself a favor and catch the Simpsons the Movie, for a film with allot of charm and hard laughs !!!! An American Classic !!! It's a 10 !!!",10,4,10,31 July 2007
Up in the Air," If you have been laid off or Fired, I do not recommend seeing this film...
","Well, Jason Reitman's timing couldn't have been better, considering that unemployment is 10% and underemployment is almost twice as much.With the state of the economy, and the uncertainty of the future, due to the manipulation by the U.S. Government, and their overblown sense of importance, this film accurately depicts the life of Ryan Bingham(George Clooney), and his perception of life.Ryan a middle-aged traveling 'HITMAN', in the sense of a 'Turk', a person hired to reduce extra or obsolete workers(that view being seen from the eyes of the Employer), and to terminate their employment, by glib matter of fact dismissing them, and their lives, with a little optimistic pep talk, and a folder (that has ALL of their answers.) Compensation and stuff. Nothing like a folder to sum up your life's value and dreams. Being on the road over 254 days a year, has added a few miles to Ryan, although he is in somewhat of a denial. Subplots include Alex Goran(Vera Farmiga), a casual relationship that reflects the emptiness in Ryan's life. Enter Natalie Keener(Anna Kendrick) starry eyed college grad top of her class, who has been hired by the same company Ryan works for, to reduce waste, by eliminating the travel of the 'Hitman' and eliminating people from their employment by firing them thru the use of computer screens. Reducing costs and validity are a BIG part of this film. Actually the value and meaning of life are the main themes, and are understated in each of the characters. Questions like, are you your job, and what are the sum of your parts. Ryan is also a part-time motivational speaker, who gets top dollar by telling people that in order to experience life, you must rid themselves of all emotional and physical baggage. Wow, of course when the single but social Ryan reflects on his mortality, he decides to change course, with dramatic consequences. While there are ALLOT of laughs, the new Electronic but Sterile society reflects the diminishing value of loyalty. The greater the technological achievements the less connection between people, ironic, isn't it.So, while the film doesn't deliver a deep and powerful emotional impact, it does make us stop and think about the people we are, and what makes us human. Clooney does another fine job, as well as the rest of the actors. He is sensitive, without being melodramatic.I thought for what it's worth, the film delivers the message that people need to remain connected, even in an age of disconnection.This film is number 9, in every film with a title of 'Up In The Air.' A worthy effort, but don't expect a huge emotional impact, but realize that you are important, and don't need a folder to validate your life.I gave the film a rating of 8. Running time 149 minutes.",8,0,2,13 January 2010
