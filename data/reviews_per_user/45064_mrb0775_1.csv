The Blair Witch Project," Fraudulent Movie Reviews Conned People Into Paying Money To See This Crap!
","In the summer of 1999, after reading a couple over zealous (to say the least) film reviews, which heaped much praise on 'The Blair Witch Project', while helping to bring more public attention to the flick, such publicity, unfortunately, led my wife and I to become victims of being suckered into wasting some of our hard earned money to buy tickets to one of the top frauds ever pulled on unwary moviegoers.Certainly, low budget horror films, such as the original 'Night of the Living Dead', and 'Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer', to give just 2 examples, have proven that genuine chills and suspense can be generated by some very modestly produced film efforts. But for my Mrs and I, the only reactions that 'Blair Witch' was able to create in us were tedium, as well as my wife becoming nauseous from the constantly jerky camera movement, which was the major defining feature of the movie's purely amateurish photography. I wouldn't dignify that 'camerawork' by calling it cinematography.Some people who tend to overrate 'Blair Witch', try to claim that in order for audience members to be able to perceive the supposedly authentic horror and terror of the flick, those viewers must be able to effectively use their own imaginations to fully appreciate the film. But that's just pure BS, folks! Because with 'Blair Witch's' middle school level of overacting, and its crude photographic technique, in order for my imagination (which is quite good) to really succeed at helping the movie create an actual sense of terror, I'd have to work as hard at exercising my imagination, as would be required for me imagining that Megan Fox is actually treating me to some nice oral sex, right now!BTW, without me presenting any specific spoilers here, let me quote an actually HONEST professional review of 'The Blair Witch Project' that comes directly from the 1651 page '2007 DVD & Video Guide', by Mick Martin and Marsha Porter.
Here's their entire capsule review of 'The Blair Witch Project', as it appears on page 114 of that handy & informative volume, about movies available on video.
'A fiendishly clever publicity campaign fueled the release of this ultra-low budget quickie, which turned out to be one of the biggest swindles ever perpetrated on unsuspecting movie audiences. This 'faux documentary' about three young filmmakers who meet an uncertain fate while investigating an old legend in the Maryland woods, fails to deliver, on all counts.'So, as many readers will have already surmised, from the description of 'The Blair Witch Project', provided in that DVD/movie guide, the authors of that book gave 'Blair Witch' their LOWEST rating, which is their classification of TURKEY, that's reserved for really poor movies. And honestly, if IMDb's ratings included a ZERO STAR rating, that's precisely what I'd assign to crap like 'The Blair Witch Project'!!",1,5,13,8 September 2019
