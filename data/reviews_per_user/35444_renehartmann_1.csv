Blade Runner 2049," Dull Cliché
","Cinematography: Cliché....for a moment i thought i sat in the sequel of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. Mono dimensional and simplistic, it lacks the tension of the first movies post apocalyptic tone and manner.Casting/characters: flat. If the lead character K is a 'good' robot, designed to be 'nice,' then 'out' are the terse dialogues between Deckard, Gaff and Bryant. The lack of quality support actors that carried the original (Batty, Tyrell, JF Sebastian), makes Deckart's 2049 dog look like a hero.Many irrelevant echos and references to the original movie. Borderline cheesy. I appreciate 'Atari' as pun...A real story line is absent. Nor does the story get anywhere close to being thought provoking: 'artificial lifeforms shouldn't replicate'...really?Music: Vangelis' synthesizer music was 'state of the art' in 1982. Hans Zimmer's music, by contrast is dull...and loud....Summary: I wanted to like this movie. But instead, i found it bad, boring, uninspiring. IMDb's score for the original movie is 8.2. In today's money that would be around 20. An 8.6 for the new version is, even in that context, too high.",2,18,37,10 October 2017
