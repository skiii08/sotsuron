Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," such a great movie
","i don't know how it was done, but this movie gets better as you see it more. i saw it the first time with my girlfriend, and we both agreed that it was really good. but had some kinda mispleasures about it. but as we saw it the next day, we both agreed that it was amazing. if you have only seen it once, go see it again. i guarantee that you will like it much more the second time. i have seen it 6 times already. and every time i notice something else, something new, and something amazing. it is a great movie overall, definitely one of my most favorite movies of all time.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
