Hereditary," Do not pay attention to bad reviews! What a gem!
","I usually read reviews before watching a movie, and it's really easy to be discouraged by negative ones. This movie has bad reviews (like every other movie) but I don't think it deserves that. 
The first part is slow yet captivating; do not expect to be frightened since the very beginning. If you keep watching, you will be satisfied. 
The thing I liked the most is that it is not the tipical/stereotype horror movie with paranormal events, it's unique! The acting is great and so is the plot. There are unexpected moments, gory scenes and scary parts.
I am a big horror movies fan and unfortunately nowadays we have to deal with predictable movies that all look the same. This one, as I already mentioned, is unique and so satisfying. Please, once again, do not trust bad reviews! I watched it twice and never got bored.",9,7,13,1 September 2018
