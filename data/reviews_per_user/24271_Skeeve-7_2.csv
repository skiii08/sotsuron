Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," not as superficial as it seems
","This movie will entertain you with the greatest visual FX ever! It will entertain you with great exasperating action sequences and the most stylish lightsabre fighting ever seen.However, when you take a closer look, this movie is not as superficial as it seems. It also contains one truth, one will, one dream, one destiny and one love. These are revealed as small details in the short periods between the action sequences, but they are nevertheless important in regard to the Saga's future.Eventually, this film shows how the dark force undermines the democracy of the galaxy by using the Trade Federation as a menace to Naboo thus the senate appears to be unable to deal with conflicts. Even the Jedi do not realize that it is only a 'Phantom Menace' which helps the Sith to infiltrate the most powerful political center of the galaxy and to take their first step towards the Empire.The actors? Well, i admit that you can hardly call them ACTors because they do not seem to develop their characters very much. I also think they are not supposed to. I think George Lucas chose so many great actors because he wanted them to have a charismatic effect without losing time to show their characters' development. On the overall, I feel that he is successful. Skeeve@redseven.de",8,0,0,23 August 1999
Pearl Harbor," could have been good
","I got this idea, you know, making a movie called 'pearl harbor'.It needs to have big budget, great effects and good direction. With Jerry B. and Michael B. it all seems to turn out very nice.I then decide to save a lot of money in getting supported by the Navy. I may have to change a few details here and there, let the Navy-guys appear to be very brave and heroic, and emphasize who won the war in the very end. But that's not too bad, is it?I eventually remember that I have to SELL the movie as well and think of all this teenagers longing for love-stories. So I do this nurse-the-pilot-and-his-friend thing, blur the gore-scenes after the bombing and dont show any smoking at all. That's worth the effort, is`nt it?Perhaps its a little too easy to see through my concept. Well, I might show how SERIOUS I take this love-story in lengthening the plot to nearly three hours.I wanted to make a movie called 'pearl harbor'. I think I messed it up.",Null,0,0,7 June 2001
