The Blair Witch Project," Not scary but funny all things considered.
","My advice to anyone planning on being scared in this movie is not to read the details on how it was made or anything else other than just the 'mythological' backstory to it.Anyway, I went to this movie expected to be scared. Instead, I found that it was quite absurdly amusing in a number many ways: First, the characters just losing it and freaking out, Mike especially, was funny. It was understandable for them to be frustrated by the situation but they didn't do much to resolve it, instead they worsened it. Then secondly, we had Heather, despite being supposedly upset, frustrated, scared or losing it, had the ever present video recorder or 16mm camera by her side -- I mean, right up to the end!. How unrealistic and absurd is that? Too funny. Then thirdly, the plain stupidity of the characters -- hello?!? -- follow the path of the river or stream, that's should be in that 'survival' camping book you showed us earlier. And how dumb can you be to have a map and a compass and not find your way home, but instead, throw away the map and get mad then tape it all! Ridiculous! Then the ending was a complete joke. What spoiled this movie was that I'd read a number of articles on this movie and how it was made.... I did enjoy the movie, not because I was scared s***less, but cuz I was laughing so much at the shear absurdity of it. --e!",5,0,2,19 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Incredible!
","I got to see an advanced, special screening of Sleepy Hollow. I was just checking out the new trailer online the other night, but the trailer doesn't show how good the movie is. According to the announcer just before the beginning of the movie, the version we saw was a 'working production' meaning that the final touches weren't added (I beg to differ after seeing it) or if the questionnaires we filled at the end sufficiently trashed the movie or any part of it, they'd change it. Judging from the audience response (cheers and applause), I don't expect much or anything to be changed.Within the first few minutes, I was stunned by the cinematography. The imagery is simply outstanding. Not only does it help set the tone and darkish foggy-like atmosphere of the movie, but it's also has great contrast and sharp, well defined images. Emmanuel Lubezki (Meet Joe Black) has outdone himself. It's right up there with the great look of movies like American Beauty, Fight Club, Three Kings and The Matrix. It's gonna be hard picking a winner come Oscar time. The music done by Danny Elfman is grand and creates an epic mood, like the movie is larger than life. The movie certainly doesn't disappoint in this respect. Do yourself a favor and not go to your local substandard theatre with 5 dollar speakers. Your cinematic experience will be lessened if you do.Washington Irving wrote the story, while the screen adaptation was by Tom Stoppard, Kevin Yagher and the script written by Se7en's Andrew Kevin Walker. The part of Ichabod Crane is one of Johnny Depp's better roles. He doesn't take himself too seriously (he's not the Sherlock Holmes kind of investigator) and is funny in some parts. Christina Ricci plays her part well enough. Of course, there's a little love story thrown in between them, for all times sake that really isn't necessary. But it's so insignificant that we can overlook it and the movie doesn't suffer because of it. The real star of the movie is the headless horseman played by Christopher Walken, without his magnetic charm and charisma. The fight sequences are like something out of Conan The Barbarian but much, much better. One scene (the bridge scene) which pays some homage to Ben Kenobi's death scene, was so good that the audience gave a round of cheers and applause. The headless horseman kinda reminded me of Darth Vader, completely fearless and unstoppable. And he's not just killing people because they hurt his feelings or because he's just so evil or because he's got a chip on his shoulder. There's a solid reason why he's murderous and it's all revealed in good time. There really isn't anything to complain about this movie. It has a tightly written script, good performances all round, great story and action scenes, particularly the end, which was remotely reminded me of a scene in The Mask Of Zorro. I'll be very surprised if this movie doesn't do well when it comes out. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year, in all respects. I'll be seeing it again when it's in wide release. --e!",Null,0,0,24 October 1999
