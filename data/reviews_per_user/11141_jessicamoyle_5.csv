Blade Runner 2049," Keeps Bladerunner too
","One of the few films revived after the originals that has worked and stayed true to the original theme, it continues with a key point on humanity. Casting lead surprisingly worked, the others were well cast too, I'd expect Jared Leto in that role.The last scene and plot was done well I think, maybe not so intense reveal but because of the story, itself really worked well.",9,0,9,23 February 2018
Walk the Line," Meh - odd choices for a Johnny Cash film
","The stories or slim snippets of people's truths were an odd selection for a basis of a Johnny Cash film.Seems superficial, given everything of Johnny Cash's life and character, I didn't think much of this, and if I base my opinion of it all solely on the film, I couldn't believe in the characters, I can't believe in the Hollywood drama that could have been a workable formula 15 years ago.The acting was ok given what they had to work with on the film. Also there was not enough good material in this film to engage with the audience given the subject matter, but if you want a light formulaic drama film bearing in mind this probably more resonant of a 'based on a true story', it could be your thing.",3,0,0,23 February 2018
A Star Is Born," Overhyped with industry backing no doubt
","There's no point doing remakes if you can't make them better - just riding off the originals and indulging with formulaic strings, there's just so many other original films out there.",5,2,3,31 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Great film, surprised by some negative IMDB reviews
","We are star war fans and thought this was just as great an installment as The Force Awakens and original trilogy with well-loved trademark elements mixed with better quality next generation story telling/film-making which gives this trilogy a great unique edge - I personally think this makes the final trilogy relevant both from its original theme and for the new generation of films we see (the acclaimed ones rather than the overdone franchises out there). There are great contemporary characters and storytelling with morals to learn in this film too that you don't get to see done so well or even covered in most mainstream movies, one thing I particularly love about Star Wars. If you remember the original Star Wars trilogy and appreciated it for what is (great story, still sci-fi with some light hearted fun), and appreciate the new trilogy is made in this generation - I then hope you enjoy this film all the same. If you expect it to be exactly the same as the original attached with characters that haven't developed since then, you might not like the movie, and it's probably best to re-watch the originals that already exist.",10,3,13,24 December 2017
The Great Gatsby," Film was good except the annoying music/soundtrack
","I like Luhrmann's take on films and soundtracks usually - but this film's strange annoying choice of music style was really off-putting. It was so mismatched like they were trying to MTV it with advertising Coke or something mainstream. Shame, would be great to see this with a soundtrack that suits the style of the storytelling/theme.",6,4,5,4 May 2019
