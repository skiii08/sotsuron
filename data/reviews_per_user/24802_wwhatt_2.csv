The Devil's Advocate," Solid flick
","This is a great thriller, I got worried when it started to get a little horror/supernatural but it all raps up rather nicely. Psychological thriller with some great court room drama.it's great to see AP play such a devious part in this, he really nailed the sinister nature of his character. Keanu Reaves worried me a little bit at the start with the southern accent but it really wasn't that distracting. His acting really pops out in this little gem.",8,0,1,12 May 2019
Sausage Party," An 'adult' film made for 14 year olds
","The same tired, bland stoner humor from one of the most uninspiring writers- Seth Rogen.Seriously, if you're THAT curious about this garbage; go search 'sausage party top scenes' in youtube- watch 3-4 minutes and you will experience 95% of the movie's jokes.and don't get me wrong, I love raunchy animated slapstick humor but this movies tries way too hard. You can see all the jokes coming from a mile away.",Null,2,7,3 March 2017
