Come and See," True horror of WWII
","Words cannot describe this masterpiece of cinema. Truly shocking portrait of World War II shown thru the eyes of a kid placed in a center of death, insanity, Nazi bestiality and other gruesome events in Belarussia during one of the darkest time in human history. Full of grotesque and bizarre images with camera movements that simulate human eye and fantastic acting of nonprofessional and, actually, not actors at all, makes this very painful and shocking to watch and experience. Actually, watching this movie is experience that should warn us not to forget what actually was and is a hell of war.Masterpiece! 10/10",10,5,8,19 June 2006
The Ring," Weak ... :(
",I will not write too many words for this remake - just want to say I'll give it 5/10 but only because of amazing horse scene - everything else is weak copy of Japanese original and should deserve lower mark.Sad. :(,5,0,0,4 February 2003
