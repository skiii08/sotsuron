The Young Victoria," Lovely to look at, but ultimately disappointing
","I had expected great things of this film. The costumes and sets are rich and sumptuous. All the actors are excellent. Emily Blunt makes an appealing Victoria. The mise-en-scene is certainly easy on the eyes.BUT ... The pacing of the plot is just s-o-o-o slow, like those oh-so-earnest BBC television adaptations of great novels. Perhaps if I had seen it on television in installments, I would have enjoyed it more.In addition, there is too much jumping around from England to the continent and back, as if the scriptwriters couldn't settle on what sort of story to tell. Perhaps they were trying for a personal story set against a backdrop of political intrigue, but I'm sorry, it didn't work for me. I found it confusing and difficult to follow. I'll pass on acquiring this one when it's released on DVD.The title of my review sums it up.",6,5,9,20 February 2010
Enchanted," 'Enchanted' is enchanting.
","My partner and I saw 'Enchanted' this afternoon. He was not enthusiastic about going to see it, but because I wanted to, he tagged along. What a delightful film this is! Everyone in the cast is practically perfect. The more familiar one is with Disney animated classics, the funnier the film will be. I couldn't help laughing out loud at many of the digs and references to earlier films. What really makes the film work is that it has that elusive quality, 'Heart.' My only observation is that many may consider this simply a children's film. The final conflict between the prince's stepmother and Giselle had a few of the children in the theater in tears, it was so intense. For those aged 12 or older, it's an excellent film. Both of us were enchanted by 'Enchanted.'",9,2,3,29 December 2007
Mamma Mia!," Sheer and utter joy from beginning to end
","As my partner and I waited to go into the theater where MAMMA MIA was playing, the previous show's audience was just coming out. Everyone seemed to be smiling and laughing. I really didn't know what to expect from this film, not having been a big fan of ABBA in its heyday and not having seen the stage musical. Suffice it to say that for sheer escapism and fun, this film is easily the most entertaining movie I've seen in a very long time.I can't imagine the film being more perfectly cast than it is. Meryl Streep never ceases to amaze me. Is there no end to this woman's talent? Everyone in the film gives the illusion (if illusion it is) of having the time of their life. Even though one or two of the songs didn't really fit the context of the scene in which they were presented, they were catchy and tuneful.As we came out of the theater, the entire audience seemed to be smiling and laughing. It's that kind of movie.GO!",10,1,2,19 July 2008
Stardust," An Unexpected Pleasure
","I've read a lot of differing opinions about 'Stardust,' from raves to pans. One of my co-workers won't go see it because some of her friends have told her that it takes liberties with the book that they felt were unacceptable. She says that she may see it when it's released on DVD. I'm sorry, but I don't understand people who don't like movies because they don't follow the book exactly. They're two different mediums, for Pete's sake! What may read well on the written page may not play well on the big screen. After all, is 'The Wizard of Oz' less of a classic because it didn't adhere scrupulously to L. Frank Baum's original book? Is Walt Disney's 'Bambi' less moving because it took liberties with Felix Salten's tale?There! I've gotten THAT off my chest!My partner and I both thoroughly enjoyed 'Stardust.' It has action, adventure, humor, and magic. It starts off a bit slowly, but once it gets going, it's great fun. And unlike other fantasy films of recent years, this one is self-contained. The end of the movie is the end of the story. Michelle Pfeiffer seems to take delight in portraying evil women these days (viz. 'Hairspray' and now 'Stardust') and she's wonderful. Peter O'Toole is fine as the old king. Robert DiNiro is absolutely hysterical in his role as Captain Shakespeare. The rest of the cast couldn't be bettered. All the threads of the story wrap themselves up very nicely in the finale. We definitely will be acquiring this one on DVD when it's released.",9,1,1,17 August 2007
