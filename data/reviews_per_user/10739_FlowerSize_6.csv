","Somehow I did not burn with a strong desire to watch this film, because there was a feeling that I would not like it. But it turned out that he looked even twice by chance, of course.
I will not say that I did not like it at all, but just my expectations were confirmed. This film is from the category of 'horror 90'. For me, they are such that it is very difficult to scare, in General, as a children's horror stories or something. Although most shooting no claims as to the performance of the actors - all very worthy and truthfully, there's just no moments that tickle the nerves.
The plot revolves around a small town with a strange, as it turned out later, the story. Here every 27 years there are mass disappearances of children and no one knows what's wrong. Here a group of boys 10 years of age and trying to find the tips and edges of this story - after all, summer what to do with the kids?
I can not recommend to view, as the film is not bad. Just for those waiting for this film exciting moments they should not wait, as everything here is very modest in this respect.",7,0,0,15 September 2019

","The film genre is not for nothing marked as horror, in the second half of the film you are really scared. It is terrible to realize that you are surrounded by such people, and perhaps you yourself are not without sin. In the end, as you know, neither drugs nor alcohol cause madness in people.",8,1,1,4 September 2019

They would run, but run they can't, psychotropic mushrooms did the trick.The film is recommended, I looked on one breath.
Very much.I especially remember the smile of the heroine wet and Nesmeyana at the end of the film.

The Queen," The Queen
","The film shows the life of a family of monarchs in the difficult days after the death of Princess Diana.
In the role of the British Queen I adore Helen Mirren. Not love historical and biographical films, watch sake of it. And I do not regret the time spent. She embodied the image of the Queen to the smallest detail: gait, gestures, manner of speaking, looks... Well, the makeup artists added to the resemblance. It is not surprising that for this role she won the Oscar.In General, the selection of actors is very decent.The story is shown very humanly, without pathos, without hysteria, without excesses. While watching follow the behind-the-scenes lives of ordinary people, even titled.The overall picture of the film is at a high level. Impressed by the scenery, costumes, light, sound, makeup artists.On the evening when you do not want to watch an empty Comedy or another boevichok, remember about the 'Queen', a worthy film. On the web it can be found in the public domain.",7,0,0,10 September 2019
