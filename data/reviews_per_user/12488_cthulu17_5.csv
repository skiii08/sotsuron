The Avengers," The Avengers: Delivering the goods
","If I was to describe the Avengers in a single word it would be this: Nirvana. The film wants for nothing. There's action, story, character development, and well placed humor bits. It's everything we were promised and nothing we weren't. You want super hero conflicts? You got 'em. You want gratuitous amounts of action? You got it. You want Stan a Lee Cameo? Better question: could it be an Avenger movie at this point without one? You want Hulk Smash? You bet your sweet candy ass Hulk Smash! There are a few nit-picky things that I could say about the movie, but they all fall wildly short of what the movie gets right. This movie is a rock star affair from start to finish, with the screen play by Joss Whedon (geeks try to hold it together), and visual and sound effects done by none other than Weta studios and Skywalker light and sound.You already know the cast, we all know the score. So its time to strap in and enjoy the ride. And you had best strap in since the pace for avengers after the intro sequence is somewhere between frenetic and murderous. There really is no lull in the story or the action that lasted longer than my attention span, and that's saying something for a man with ADHD. There really is an awful lot crammed into that 2 hours and 23 minutes and believe me they make use of damn near every second. With so many stars though, it is true that some character development got sacrificed, most notably for Hawkeye, but it seems to have done very little to diminish the film as a whole.In a somewhat cross-related issue, the substitution of Mark Ruffalo for Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk was a much welcome change in my opinion. The skinny around town is that Norton wanted more money than Marvel was willing to put up and negotiations broke down. Bet he'll be kicking himself in the ass for that choice come Monday. Especially considering how many fans of the hulk this film is likely to generate. But I've always found Norton to be a little annoying and Ruffalo does a great job, but that's just my opinion. All the other characters are amazing too, Cap is great, Iron Man steals the stage whenever he can (but not as much as I thought he would) and Thor actually levels out a bit to make a fuller transition from brash youth to wise veteran warrior.A final word on 3D and IMAX: See it in IMAX 3D, it's absolutely astounding! Catch the matin√©e showing if you have to, but don't miss your chance because it really does impact the cinematic experience. And as always STAY AFTER THE CREDITS and I do mean STAY AFTER ALL THE CREDITS. Seriously, YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS IT.Peace out.So will Avengers change the entire world as we know it? No, probably not. But it will set a precedent and a higher standard for all other films to follow.",10,1,4,6 May 2012
The Hunger Games," May leave you feeling a little hungry
","If I was to describe the hunger games in a single word, yes I know this is becoming a habit with me, it would be this: Stark. Having read the entire hunger games trilogy, I feel that this is appropriate, but does not necessarily make for the best movie. Let me clarify though: the very austere and even severe impression that I get from the movie isn't bad, it just isn't fun. Interesting, compelling, provocative yes, but fun, no.A brief word to those that are fans of the series: the movie is fine. Structurally there isn't anything wrong with it and all the most critical details are left intact, as they had damn well better be if these people hope to make a trilogy out of this. Being a fan of the series myself and having read all the books, I notice the glaring differences where small or large details have been left out and while I'm not thrilled, it didn't prove to be a deal breaker either. On the whole, I would say that this film is a perfectly adequate adaptation of the novel, not good, not bad, but adequate. It is kinda neat to see some of the elements you read about visualized and I gotta say at least a handful of them are pretty satisfying.On the positive side, I have to say that the casting is pretty good, with Lenny Kravitz being the biggest surprise and in my opinion, a fantastic choice for Cinna. The acting is good. The sets are at least mostly believable and the overall plot of the novel is left largely intact. This is quite an achievement when you consider positively Godawful adaptations of masterful works of literature like Michael Crichton's Timeline, which was thoroughly butchered into some schlock of cinema featuring Paul Walker.On the negative side, people who did not read the books may likely find the film somewhat inaccessible, and need to either read the books or have friends fill them in as they go. While I fully understand the significant challenges of adapting a novel into something that gets squeezed into 2 hours and 20 minutes, this is something that has hurt the movie. Details from the book that helped to flesh out characters or events just aren't there and end up leaving the plot feeling thinner than it really is. Things that were included are over and done with so quickly you barely have time to register them or their significance. And lastly, the soundtrack, or to be more precise the distinct lack of a soundtrack. The entire film feels so muted and while that may be good for conveying the naked despair the general population feels, it really doesn't get the audience into the film.I know it sounds like I've had a lot more bad than good to say about the film, but it really is a decent movie. If you're a fan, you're probably going to see it anyway and its not like anything is going to be spoiled for you in terms of plot twists. If you're not a fan, go ahead and check it out, you could certainly do a lot worse.",5,1,2,6 May 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Best avengers movie yet!
","So where to begin? At first I was a little apprehensive when I found out that they had cast Chris Evans for the role of Cap, since I've never seen him in anything all that serious and lets face it, Captain America is a pretty big deal. But I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by how things turned out.In my opinion this may be the best Avengers movie yet. Blasphemy! I know! Thor didn't offer too much competition, but that really wasn't its fault since Thor has never had the most interesting plots anyway, unless you've got a real thing for Norse mythology or something. Please allow me to clarify though: Thor was not bad in any way really, it just wasn't great either and it just ended up somewhere in what I consider to be a respectable sort of middle area, being better than mediocre, but not as good as great. Anyhow, the Iron Man movies were good, but they didn't have one advantage Captain America uses to the fullest: a little thing called world war 2.The other Avengers movies so far have had to struggle in some respects because they had to generate their in-film realities from scratch to a certain extent. In the case of Captain America, the cinematic reality has already been created many many times, I mean seriously, how many WWII movies do we have? And some of them were actually pretty good too. To it's favor, Captain America essentially has a very well made pre-rendered reality and atmosphere that's been built up from all the other WWII movies that have already been made. There is a wealth of cinematic information about how to make this type of period piece and it shows in the atmosphere of the film which feels both familiar and believable. There is one exception to this: I'm sure WWII history buffs that see this film will scoff at all the inaccuracies in this and every other WWII movie. But in my opinion, the reality of Captain America is very thorough and has plenty of depth.One of the things I liked most about the movie was the casting. Not just the leads, and Chris Evans did pretty well, but maybe that's just because I was scared that he would perform terribly, but the supporting cast was one of the best I've seen in a while and in a superhero movie to boot! The character of Howard Stark is interesting and really helps to build the contiguous reality of the Avengers and I'm really happy for that, since continuity is going to be a big deal for the avengers going forwards. I must say Dominic Cooper was a solid choice for the role, but for some weird reason he reminds me of Leonardo DiCaprio. Hugo Weaving is a terrific choice as the red skull (I am not spoiling anything, if you didn't know, you're just willfully ignorant at this point) as he has proved himself to be an excellent villain before in some other film I just can't seem to recall...........So anyhow, the basic breakdown is this: good atmosphere, believable acting, solid action, and actually pretty good plot. Initially I wasn't sure how they were going to tie it all in with the other Avengers threads, but now it all meshes rather nicely.Important notes: The 3D is pretty good, so it's worth the extra $3 or so in my opinion and you DEFINITELY want to stay after the credits and I mean ALL the way after the credits. It seems like they might have done the same thing that they did with the Hulk where they put the teaser right at the end, but they have a little something extra after the credits and it is AMAZING! Won't say another word about it.So go see it, it's great and check it out in 3D, they did a lot better than they did in Thor in my opinion and being in 3D was supposed to be a big part of the ad campaign for Thor, go figure.",10,2,3,6 May 2012
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Fun and entertaining genre film
","It's time for an indie movie review! What do you get when you mix classic gore/slasher elements with a comedy? Usually something pretty godawful and not worth mentioning here or anywhere else. However, sometimes, the slasher/comedy combo can be pulled off competently. Please note that all of the 'Scary movie' entries are complete and utter failures and I have no idea how they made 4 of the damned things, the first one wasn't even that funny.Fortunately I am glad to report that Tucker & Dale is a success story for slasher/comedy combos. Now admittedly I am getting to this movie a bit late, it was making the indie circuit about this time last year. However, indie films are a little quirky in when and where they're released (reference similar issues I had with Boondock Saints II). But happy days are here and I found this little gem amongst a rather large pile of dross whilst wandering through the cavernous expanse of the interblag...blag.....blag.....blag (this joke would probably be a lot funnier if I had audio, but I refuse to let you people hear my actual voice, sounds terrible over a mic).So what makes Tucker & Dale a success? If I had to pin it on any single element of the production, it would be that the story at its core is quite simple: a single misunderstanding explodes completely out of proportion. There's no sleight of hand and no fancy tricks, just stupid people making assumptions based on fear. Now there's plenty of gore, but the way it ends up happening is actually pretty inventive and I won't spoil anything, but I think its good to see classic slapstick reapplied to the horror genre. God knows it needs an overhaul in the creativity department these days.So anyhow, good fun romp, see it if you can. It will likely be available on netflix in the coming months.Peace out everyone.",8,1,1,6 May 2012
In Time," Fun witty romp with action beats
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself 'this looks kinda neat, I think I'll enjoy it.' So after that I promptly stopped watching any trailers for it and avoided all news media concerning it. Didn't even look on IMDb for the filmography. Yes, I review movies and remained willfully ignorant of as many of the pertinent details of the film as possible. Why you might ask? It's simple really, when I saw TRON, it was the same deal: I avoided being saturated by news media about the film like some of my friends and was thus able to enjoy the movie more than they did. I was actually really excited when Daft Punk showed up because I had no idea they were going to be in the movie.Anyhow, what's this movie about? The simplest and fastest explanation is this: it's a dystopian future where time is quite literally money, and life. Everyone has been techno-organically wired with clocks that keep time, which they use as currency to purchase everything and also determines how long they will live. One of the side effects of the process is that no one ages past 25, which does make things kinda funny since you have no idea how old anyone really is.When I started writing this review, I finally looked up the filmography and found out that the movie was directed by none other than Andrew Niccol. Now this name probably doesn't mean anything to you and I don't blame you if that's the case. However, Andrew directed at least one film that is very near and dear to my heart called Gattaca, which is a terrific sci-fi gem from that 90's that quite frankly deserves a review of its own even now (at least I know what my next review will be). Oh yeah, he also directed the Truman Show if you liked that, I thought it was interesting at any rate.The two thing about Gattaca were that it didn't get a lot of attention at the time it came out and still doesn't have the kind of recognition I think it really deserves, the other thing was that it really got across an important message about bio-ethics without being heavy handed and preachy. This is reflected somewhat with In Time, where the message is about wealth and class. I feel it has some similarities to brave new world, but feel free to disagree.So, the review proper: the acting is pretty good and the writing is solid enough for most discerning palettes I think. I've never really hated on Justin Timberlake too much, but I have to admit I was a bit incredulous about his skills as an actor until this realization dawned on me: he was able to fool entire hordes of teens into thinking his work was legitimate music for years; the man has definite experience in suspending disbelief. But seriously, he's a really solid lead in this and Amanda Seyfried is no slouch either (the fact that she's really hot doesn't hurt either). The action is not as intense as I would have liked, but it is serviceable and Timberlake's tongue-in-cheek attitude towards a lot of what happens is actually rather refreshing when compared with the usual smug self assured or dark archetypes of most action leads.Final analysis: this movie is interesting and somewhat compelling, go see it and if you don't feel like there's an interesting message, just sit back and enjoy the eye candy anyway.",7,0,0,6 May 2012
