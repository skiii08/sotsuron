Mission: Impossible III," Amazing..best of the 3 Movies
","The 1st one was very good, the 2nd was OK, the 3rd was amazing.This is pretty much describes it, mission impossible means loads of action, unexpected storyline..and M:I 3 was successful in both points by a big margin It has been long time really long time since a movie kept me on the edge of my seat till the last minute.The best thing about this movie is that you can't be bored for 1 minute, every minute is worth watching, and it is very rare these days to have a movie like that.The only -ve point is that I felt the movie was so fast, the storyline needed more time, and we needed some more information on ''the bad guys'' especially the Chinese seen where Tom Cruis entered the building full of armed men to get the rabbit foot, and just after 3 minutes he was out with it,,without knowing what exactly happened inside??!Other than it is excellent, if want to watch a quality action movie, don't miss M:I 3",9,2,4,7 May 2006
Saw II," Better than the 1st one..AMAZING
","SAW was one if the best thrill movies I have ever seen, the idea, the thrilling action that the movie had in my opinion was never done before in any thrill movie.SAW2 even raises the bar, it has raised the thrill level, the death ideas in the movie is just great and let you feel exactly if you were in the same circumstances.Direction is Excellent, sound effects and everything make you even feel the pain of the character suffering in front of you.I think actors did pretty good in each position, however some more depth in each character would have been better.The only thing that the movie didn't show well, is the connection between it and the 1st one, it is NOT bad but for myself I needed more.Overall Excellent movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes Thrill or Horror movies.",9,0,1,30 October 2005
V for Vendetta," Good Story/Idea and nice Acting but BORING!!
","Well..I never read the book before and I know nothing about the story or the idea of the comic book. I went to watch this movie because of the hype and the very high rating that I can see here and I don't know why it has this strange high rating for an average movie?I went and I was expecting an awesome movie in both the story and action side..but I was really disappointed.The movie itself didn't start in the right way, I kept wondering almost till the 1/2 of the movie who is this person and why he is doing this. A lot of clueless conversation..but I kept saying to myself..it will get better.At half of the movie things started to get better/but still without any clue on how this person got his power/money/training to do all of what he is doing.Only the last 15 minutes of the movie have nice acting and action scenes.The problem with this movie is that the V character is just shallow and I couldn't get any clue how did he posses money??where are these people that are working with him to send 10,000 V masks to all the city?!!!.how does he make all these stuff when he is sitting inside his underground house??!!!I only gave 5 for the idea and the acting.",5,0,5,26 March 2006
