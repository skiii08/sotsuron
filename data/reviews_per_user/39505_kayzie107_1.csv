The Sound of Music," Great entertainment.
","Beautiful music.  Beautiful scenery. Even though the Von Trapp story is sanitized, that is secondary to the music.  This movie has great music, great scenery. This movie puts a smile on your face.  Something you don't see after watching any of today's movies.",10,1,7,9 December 1998
