Kill Bill: Vol. 2," No, no, no. Please.....no.
","I hate saying what I am about to say. I adored the first volume and I think QT is one of the best film makers, hands down.With that said: This movie stunk. It bored me to death for the whole first half. Once The Bride starts her training with Pai Mei...it gets better, I admit. Until that point, though, I was really ready to walk out. In fact, I had BEEN ready to walk out about 20 different times.I do think this film picks up about half way through. So I can give it that much credit.My suggestion is to rent it when it comes out, that way you can fast forward through all of the crap and get to some decent scenes.
Sorry, folks. As I said, I love QT and I loved the first installment, but this was mostly lame. :(",3,3,6,26 April 2004
Dawn of the Dead," 8/10
","I give this movie an 8 because it scared the crap out of me. I should mention here that I have a special sort of fear for zombie movies. I really don't know why.I liked it a lot. I do have complaints but they are only based on my 'RUN, RUN, DAMN YOU!!!! RUUUUUUUN!' ideas that go through my head during such a movie (in other words, cliche things that have run themselves out.....).
Other than that, it was pretty cool.I am going to have nightmares. Ugh. If you dig that whole 'zombie' movie thing, this is a fun flick to see. If you are like me, though, and see these only to torture yourself with fear.....well, heck, I guess it is still fun. hahaha.I think horror movie types should see it. Seriously. Good scares, good actors, good makeup, great ending.Cheers!",8,0,0,20 March 2004
28 Days Later...," Oh yeah!
","I don't understand the complaints about this movie. I just don't.
This film had beautiful moments and frightening ideas. Sure, some of these ideas have been 'done', but my point is this:The film makers tried to add in their own spice throughout the film and it made it great. There is eye candy all through it. And haven't most of us wondered what it would be like to wake up....to nothing?
I say see this film. Definately. ENJOY!",9,0,1,12 November 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Really, really good.
","I just saw this a couple of hours ago and it is quite good.
1. I adore Jim Carrey in this film. 2. Kate Winslet is bound to win something for her role in this film. 3. I was annoyed more than entertained by that Dunst actress and even Elijah Wood. Maybe I was just in a bad mood? haha.This movie is a MUST see. It makes you question what you would do in a similar situation. It was well written and the scenes, while sometimes strange and confusing, were beautiful. This movie was full of humor, love, and some sadness.",9,0,1,20 March 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," Beautiful!
","I have watched this film once a year since I was about 7 years old, and I swear it's just as good every time I see it. I love Jimmy Stewart. I mean LOVE HIM. His character in this film is so true to life that you feel his tension, his happiness, his pain, his hysteria, and his laughter. Donna Reed is glamorous and lovable. His children are kind of nutty and hilarious; just like most children in life.
This film truly illustrates that unanswered prayers are sometimes best, and that the life you live may not be as bad as you once thought.
See this movie at least once in your life, it is very much worth it.",10,0,4,24 August 2003
