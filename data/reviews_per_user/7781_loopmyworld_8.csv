Skyfall," At the Skyfalls... where Bond falls !!!!
","50 years of the legacy of the greatest most longest running character 007 James Bond returns with Skyfall with its 23rd venture. Skyfall is all about 007 loyalty is been tested for M as her past is been haunted & the heart of London MI6 is under attack. So does Skyfall rises or falls ????? Falls > I still don't get it why they don't use the traditional gun barrel at the beginning of the movie which totally gives you the feel of entering the movie, besides just start movie like other one's.> The pre-credit sequence fails to reach the expectations of 007 league> The pre-credit action sequence is mixture of many other movies>Showing 007 died in the beginning of the movie was totally ripped from the 1969 007 opening sequence of You only live twice> Severine dressing style was ripped from 1995 007 movie Goldeneye villain's henchmen Onatop, & also getting introduced in casino which exactly happens in Goldeneye along with Bond introducing himself.> The story of Skyfall is been raised from so many Hollywood movies such as The Bourne series, Goldeneye, The dark knight series & so on> 007 struggling with his health issues is ripped of from the dark knight rises as Batman faces his health problems too > James Bond fight again this time with his fellow agent as shown in Goldeneye, but of course manipulated the character of main villain> The villain tries to act like Joker from The dark knight but does'NT succeed > Very less time has been spent on villain besides action nothing more > How villain escapes the glass room under the MI6 custody, remains a question > With the introduction of Q there are no new gadgets as i was expecting, besides they just ripped another gadget from Licence to kill sniper rifle which was programmed for bond hands only & in Skyfall its the latest Walter ppk > The sex scene of Bond & Severine is again taken from A view to a kill, where Roger & Stacey are in shower too > The villain's plan to get caught is directly ripped from the dark knight , where Joker plans to get caught> Bond taking M to his home & kill Silva does'NT make sense at all & way boring to watch > Bond preparing to guard M in his own home is another rip off from another Hollywood movie { can't recall at the moment } > The movie ended in an unexpected way by just introducing new Moneypenny & M > Really can't believe 007 crying for M imagine Bond did'NT cry when his wife got murdered in On her majesty's secret service & he is crying over his boss, total bullshit Rises > Title track is way soothing & loved it the moment i heard it > perfect use of lighting in Shanghai, one of the best ever seen in the movies so far > Villain's intro along with his short rat story was perfect 10/10 > The after effect which Silva faced after being tortured shown perfectly> Severine looks beautiful & super hot perfect for a bond girl > Bond & Silva chase was the best action sequence in the movie so far > M dieing in the end was the most happiest moment for me, as i was tolerating her since Goldeneye > Q being young in the movie definitely a better choice in this modern tech worldSkyfall definitely lacks the class & league of James Bond movie, as they have totally changed 007 in this modern world. 007 is no longer British secret service is he more likely to be super hero like Batman. For god sake Michael G Wilson & Barbara Broccoli please don't kill & ruin the hard work of your father of the last 50 years of making James Bond & the legacy of Ian Fleming's greatest art work of making 007. I really regret that i did'NT watch Skyfall in theater but now i say i am happy that i did'NT watch it. I want James Bond to return with its roots not as the Batman.MY RATING 6/10 !!!!",2,7,15,14 March 2013
Pearl Harbor," No matter what people & critics say about this movie but this is Bay's finest job behind camera !!!!
","I really don't understand the concept of people hating this movie. I mean can someone please explain me where this movie lacks soul, a good direction, background score & screenplay. The movie is 3 hours long & to be honest I hate watching movies which are so lengthy specially 3 hours. I want to watch Godfather but couldn't since the movie has 3 hours of runtime. This is the only movie which I took a risk of watching & believe me I didn't felt bored even for a sec in the whole movie. To describe movie in 1 word, I would say MASTERPIECE.The movie begins two childhood friends desires to become air force pilot. The characters of Raff & Danny are well scripted & the cast is been placed perfectly for the movie. Kate looks beautiful & charming lady working as a nurse in a navy. The love triangle between Raff, Evelyn & Danny is beautifully scripted & executed throughout the whole movie. The first 70 mins are totally based on the main characters life which I believe very well directed there was neither too much or less or romance in between Raff, Evelyn & Danny. Meanwhile Japanese makes a strategy to attack America on Pearl Harbor. The movie takes sudden twist when japs plans to attack Pearl Harbor which according me takes movie to new level. The start of air attack on Pearl Harbor are the soul of the movie. The 40 mins of Pearl Harbor attack is gonna blow you away. The action sequences at its best, & of course it will be cause Michael Bay is behind camera. Best use of cgi in that year made this movie to have the best war action sequence ever hit Hollywood screens. The attack on Pearl Harbor what I believe wont have been better if any other director would have directed this movie. The action any days beats the war action sequences we see today in other movies. The cast of the movie is well very casted, each & every character has a crucial role in this movie. You won't find yourself saying that this character was useless in this movie. The background score of the movie is was soothing, the japs score is perfect scored & mostly importantly the score of Pearl Harbor attack scenes adds more emotions to the movie.I don't understand why people & critics says that the love triangle wasn't needed in this movie at all. OK tell me what about Titanic, jack & rose meet up on a ship just for 2 days & they fell in love sooo deeply with each other, don't you find this hard to digest if we look practically. The love triangle takes months before attack on Pearl, which completely makes sense. Titanic sinking scenes adds emotions to the people but what about this movie, there should be more emotions involved in this movie cause this movie is based on true history, while on the other hand jack & rose are fictional characters created by James Cameroon. Well both Titanic & Pearl Harbor are completely different movie & Titanic is my all time classic movie. But we cannot say that Pearl Harbor lacks emotions in the war sequences, people Bay wanted to show the attack on Harbor to show the reality nor a emotional movie for ladies to carry with hankie in their hands. Of course there was so many moments which made me emotional too, specially when Danny dies & the last scene of the movie. Stop criticizing about the movie lack emotions, if you want emotional movies to watch. Better consider yourself as a women who cry's even on a small stupid scenes.OK the next thing, why people always blame Bay for his work, why don't you blame the writer's who actually writes the movie not Bay. OK we understand what Bay has all the authority to make some changes in the script but still he is not that fool enough to direct movies which will make people & critics blame & abuse him for his work. Appericiate for what work he has done either criticizing him. This is no doubt Bay's finest work behind camera & has been executed & portrait perfectly well on big screens. I regret myself for didn't watching this movie in theaters as I was just 14 that time & would have gone to watch it. I have seen the documentary of Pearl Harbor on National Geography, no doubt it reveals the important & crucial details about Pearl Harbor. But still Bay wanted to show the real disaster not some kind of a documentary.Watch Pearl Harbor it's a highly recommended movie. The movie which got everything a viewer needs in a movie. MY RATING – 10/10 WAY TO GO BAY !!!!!",9,1,5,17 March 2012
Transformers," Get ready to transform your self !!
","First when i saw the teaser of this movie... i found out to be usual sci-fiction movie. Saw the movie in 2008. was feeling too bored so thought let try to watch transformers. The result thrilled, enjoyed watching it. The movie has a got a strong plot along with screenplay. The previous Michael Bay movie i saw as The Island. Liked it thou..but Transformers has a strong impact on me. The Charactisation of the movie is perfect.. all the characters play the roles brilliantly.Autobots.. the good robots shared a good presence on screen... my personal fav are bumble bee, optimus & ironhide.. & looks perfect when they transforms.. iron hide looks strong as his name makes you feel it. In short Autobots are the coolest robots ever hit the history of Hollywood cinema. Decepticons mmmm perfect for the role of evil mean robots... Megatron... the best with his henchmen Starscream.. loved this chase when Bonecrusher & Optimus prime fight on the highway. the second best the when one of the Decepticons transform in front of Sam..Megan fox looks too hot & sexy. She shared the important role screen presence in the movie. The movie has got some humour & its upto the limit in the movie. The movie is gonna blow you away....Its a highly recommended movie.... finally a good blockbuster of sci-fiction movie after terminator ! my rating 10/10",10,9,15,5 December 2010
Titanic," Movie which touched the core of my heart !!!!!!!
","The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too. The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie. There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him ' what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it ' ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray. True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern. On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating – 10/10 !!!!!!!",10,10,16,29 May 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not the kind of revenge i expected but still its enjoyable in many parts !!!
","After the success of Transformes Michael Bay & Spielberg is back with Transformers revenge of the fallen. The movie introduces new alien robots like sideswipe, RC twins under autobots & newer version of bonecrusher & devastator under decepticons & the most important more hotter Megan Fox.Movie starts brilliantly & grips you as autobots join the classified strike team nest & hunt for decepticons foes around the world, & on the other hand Sam goes to college begins his life along with Megan.The movie is all about matrix hidden somewhere in Egypt by the ancestors to protect from the decepticons around 1700 BC.Megatron returns to life with the only piece of cube left & the hunt for matrix starts between autobots & decepticons. The movie is has got some of the best action sequences & exceptional CGI graphics. My personal favourite forest battle, very well executed & amazing sound efforts during the whole battle. The robots looks more detailed & the action scenes are much more smoother than the previous one. Shia has improved a lot over this movie & of course so does the Megan with her killing sexier looks. Linkin park gives the best theme song in the transformers series {New Divide}. Steve as usual gives the best score for the movie, specially during the forest battle.There are few things in the movie that i guarantee my viewers will agree with me. The RC twins were totally waste in the movie & the old age robot at the plane museum, actually they were irritating & were pain to my eyes & ears. On the other hand whenever the movie gets serious there are funny moments which ruins the mood of the movie this is the problem i have with you Bay get over it please. The movie could have been much better with the deletion of funny humour in the movie but still in many ways its enjoyable. I would recommend that Bay should have showen robots are replacing or repairing their parts damaged during the fight like painting their bodies, replacement of tyre's.But still as i am huge transformers fan i enjoyed the movie, but definitely not as the first one for sure. I rate this movie 8/10 !!!!",8,5,7,9 January 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Bane was the only reason the movie rised
","The dark knight rises begins batman being injured during his journey as a batman & batman eventually went underground staying away as batman for 8 years. The movie starts as Commissioner Gordan talking about Harvey Dent & believing in him, the next scene opens up in an open field taking 4 prisoners to aircraft. The pre credit action sequence has been taken from the James Bond movie {LICENCE TO KILL} & has been manipulated with its style but the concept remains the same, anyways back to movie the pre credit scene introduces the movie main villain character BANE. The movie is all about terrorist Bane who wants to take over Gotham & kill Batman. New character Cat Woman does her role only on the basis of her overall physical look but lacks in acting & was kinda boring on the big screen as well. While on the other hand MR Wayne is struggling to get back as Batman as he is been injured already & as his city is waiting for me to return. The movie has got some of the best action sequences of the year & it would be more appreciated in years to come. Specially the stock exchange sequence is my personal favorite & it deserved all the applause in the theatre as it was executed perfectly. Throughout the whole movie people kept on expecting more from Bane as his presence as terrorist could be felt literly. And I really wonder why people have issues with Bane's voice as they say it was not clearly heard in the movie, well I totally deny that as I was able to hear it clearly without any problem at all.The movie eventually rises & drops a sudden in between specially the times when Catwoman & Alfred are on screen. Christopher Nolan should have waited at least for more 6 months to release this film, so that he & his brother could have made some heavy script for this movie specially in character development as it was needed in many parts of the film. Watch this movie for epic performance of Tom Hardy as Bane as he really carried the movie on his shoulders till the end. Hans Zimmer does his job once again as the music composer for the final part for Batman series & specially with the epic track DESHI BASARA which in short is Bane's theme throughout the whole movie which totally suited him & his character. My rating 9/10",10,1,6,20 September 2012
Casino Royale," Another classic by Martin
","Bang......... You know my name! yes we know its james bond in his first adventure as 00. As a die hard bond fan i was totally disappointed by pierce adventures, actually he was not a bond, he would have been thrown out of bond role if he would'nt have done Goldeneye , which was Timothy Dalton's adventure. Goldeneye was the last bond movie to portrait the bond, other were just complete rubbish. lets get back to 2006. Other classic from Martin Campbell the director of Goldeneye , this time Casino Royale. keeping in mind to portrait a true bond i would say Daniel played his role brilliantly. The dark side of bond, more aggressive was perfect for this movie. In some scenes he gave the look of the true bond {Timothy Dalton}.Although i miss the famous gunbarrel of the movie like other bond movies, but the start of the title track simply brought a huge smile on my face. 10 on 10 for the title track, action scenes were great in the movie, the two bond girls looked stunning. the role of LE chiffre was played brilliantly. The thing i hate about this movie is the background music... it sounds just rubbish these days.. where is the classic tunes of John barry which is let the mark on 007 movies, Micheal kamen for Licence to kill. well in short Casino Royale returns the true bond after LIcence to kill. 10 on 10 & yes we know your name!",9,0,2,27 September 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A good movie although it still remains dark in many ways !!!!
","After the success of revenge of the fallen in terms of money grossing over the globe, Michael bay n his team returns in Transformers 3 Dark of the moon. The movie is way much better from revenge in many ways. Been unlucky not to get the chance to watch it in 3d cause, the only 3d theatre projector got busted just before the release of the movie. Totally heartbroken as my other friends enjoyed the movie in 3d. well let first give you the overall negative & positive comments of the movie in my opinion.Negative points Where is Megan fox ? if I would have Michael bay, would have done anything to get her back in this third installment & made her role much better that European chick.Was there a need of the Chinese guy in the movie director bay, I don't think so ! Megatron & Starscream were total waist in the movie, their role is not at not convincing as in previous installments.Ratchet share the screen presence for not more than a minute in the entire movie.The movie would have been better without Epps in my opinion. Bay just got him the movie to show the link between previous installments . Movie looses grip in the last 40 minutes due to excess of action & as their weren't much use of dialogues in the end.What's the need of that European chick running around in the battle ? I could see the glimpse of war of the worlds & other alien invasion movies in this film.I personally hate that scene so much the fight between Sam & Starscream, it does'nt make any sense & very unbelievable.Positive points The movie begins breathless, Autobots ark crashing on the moon & Apollo 11 sent to moon to investigate. Brilliant move Bay.Good thing that Bay rid of Rc twins, which was pleasure to my eyes & ears .Some new robots in Autobots, Que , Dino & Rackers. I became an instant fan of Dino, when he first transformers in the Middle East illegal nuclear site & his words. Way to go bay.Bumble bee is been upgraded with its design & now he can even shoot without getting transformed. Way to go bay.Optimus Prime as usual brilliant in the movie & carries the movie on his shoulders specially after getting betrayed by Sentinel Prime. He is being upgraded to with fly tech.The introduction of new Decepticon Shockwavewooooooo my new fav in Decepticons & makes me his fan with its first arrival.Laserbeak & Soundwave looks good on screen too.Sentinel Primes looks perfect as a villain against Optimus prime & much more powerful too & has been given the perfect voice to his role.Shia has improved with his acting skills in this movie, & proves that transformers is no where without him.Agent Simmons at its best again in this movie, brings smile on my face with his introduction in this movie.Mearing role is perfect for this movie, looks more powerful way strict. She share an important screen presence in the movie.The movie has got some of the best action sequences in the entire transformers series, my personal favourite, the highway battle my gosh what a chase I literally felt that I am actually inside the movie. 3 Decepticons chasing Sentinel & bumblebee, sideswipe & Dino in action. Ultimate action chase. Dino steals the show in this particular part. The best part of this chase is the background score, special thanks to my fav music composer Steve. The music touches my soul deeply every time I hear it & it suits the chase perfectly. I actually watch this particular everyday. The best action sequence in the entire transformers seriers. Masterpiece bay.Ironhide the tuff autobots does it again in the Mexican stand off & so does the sideswipe.Linkin park does it again giving another theme song for this movie, way soulful.Steve as usual give the best background score once again.This movie in my opinion could have been much better if bay & Ehren would have work more harder on the script cause I totally believe this movie could have been the best in the entire series but as usual its been ruined in many ways. If this movie would have been directed by Spielberg it could have been much better. If your planning to make a 4th one then bay please please take all your time work on the script & make a good transformers. No doubt about the effects in the movie but still you got to work on the script & screenplay. But still the movie is highly enjoyable in many ways & I loved it. As a huge transformers fan I rate it as 9 on the scale of 10 specially that highway chase which was breathless.The movie has got the best trailer ever i have ever seen. I am definitely going to buy the 3d bluray.",9,9,12,22 January 2012
