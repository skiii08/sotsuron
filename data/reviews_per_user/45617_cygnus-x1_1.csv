United 93," An amazing tribute to United 93 (Possible spoilers)
","This movie is breath-taking, moving, thought-provoking, and a great tribute to the passengers of United 93 who took a stand. These were ordinary Americans who found themselves in the midst of a an event that was a black day for America, and they did what they had to, to stop any further carnage.Part of of the movie is interspersed with the routine of UAL 93 and the larger events of the other attacks, and the confusion; the latter half is focused solely on the struggle of the passengers,to the end. It's obviously not meant to be a docu-drama about 9-11 as a whole, but puts those other terrible events as a backdrop for the human drama aboard the flight.After seeing it twice last weekend, I'm still at a loss of word to properly describe the film, except to say that it is a magnificent tribute. Amid the chaos, death, and destruction, there were acts of incredible heroism, and this is a fitting and respectful telling of one of them.",9,0,2,8 May 2006
