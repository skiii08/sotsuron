Requiem for a Dream," one of the greatest and most disturbing films ever
","I have never seen a film that affected me so much.  I loved the movie Pi, but this is a major step up for Aronofsky.  This film had everything you could hope for in a classic, beautiful photography, great acting, and music that is just as memorable as the film. I could not sleep the night after I saw it.  I am glad that Artisan did not try to get this movie rated, otherwise, a crucial scene would have probably been changed dramatically to get an R rating.  Aronofsky does not hold back in this film, almost to the point where it is hard to take it.  A must see.",10,0,0,7 November 2000
