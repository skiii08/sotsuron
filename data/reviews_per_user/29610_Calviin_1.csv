10 Cloverfield Lane," A compelling and clever story
","10 Cloverfield Lane shines insofar as Dan Trachtenberg manages to keep us on the edge of our seats with a single setting and a very limited set of characters. The strength of the movie is the fact that it always encourages us to question ourselves about the truth behind this bunker. Just like the character, we cannot make up our minds and each new piece of evidence nulls the previous one. Having not seen Cloverfield (from 2008), I have to admit that I don't know how to feel about the ending. On the one hand, I fell that the alien invasion plot line is actually clever, since that would mean Howard was not just a psychotic madman, but on the other hand, I would've almost preferred a 'conventionnal' ending, making the movie a regular behind-closed-doors thriller.In any case, the execution is flawless, the tension is here, the doubt is here, 10 Cloverfield Lane is definitely one of the most powerful movies of the first half of 2016.",9,1,2,11 June 2016
