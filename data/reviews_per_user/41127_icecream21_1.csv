Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not that bad, just underrated
","I like the Phantom menace. When I was a kid and 'The phantom menace' release in the theaters in 1999, I watched it over and over again. This maybe is my most watched Star wars movie. I have seen it more than 50 times. It's the most successful Star wars, grossing over a billion dollars and still is one of the top 20 highest-grossing movies of All time. Well, it was successful at the box-office, but most critics and fans didn't like it, probably because of the Original trilogy. But I like it, I think is underrated. It's a nice popcorn flick, with an awesome fight scenes, special effects and make up. John Williams made a great music for the movie. The actors also played their roles good - Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Jake Lloyd and Samuel L.Jackson. If you still shun this flick, watch it. You maybe enjoy it, you maybe not. Everybody has a taste.",7,4,7,17 August 2015
