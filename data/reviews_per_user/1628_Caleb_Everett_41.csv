The Avengers," Amazing.
","The team is finally together.I will admit that going into this film I wasn't sure that Loki was the correct choice for an antagonist, but he astoundingly does an amazing job! I mean, he was the bad guy in the first Thor and for him to be the carry-over villain in The Avengers seemed like it would be stale, but he does a fantastic job. I will admit that I felt like the crew sort of come together with a little more ease than I thought they would. I'm not sure that the death of someone would have been enough to have them all come together in this way, but clearly, I'm wrong...because that's exactly what happened.Fantastic movie will definitely watch again!",10,1,1,23 May 2019
First Man," Great, but could have been more.
","First, let me start by saying that the cinematography is exquisitely done. I love how all the big space reveals start first from the astronaut's helmets reflection rather than some shot of grandeur. Really makes you connect with the astronaut and makes you feel apart of the mission. The film grain that is happening in the film is also beautiful, really adds a sense of realism to a fantastic period piece.I think the plot is great and it's such a wonderful story, I couldn't give it the highest rating though because I felt like there were parts where it dragged a little and I also felt like there were large/larger stories that they sort of glossed over.I understand that during this time period there was SO much going on and it's tough to cover every little detail, but I would have loved to see them dive a little deeper into some parts.",8,0,1,26 January 2019
Gremlins," Love.
","Gremlins is an all-time classic and one of my favorite holiday films.It truly traumatized me as a kid hearing the infamous 'Santa Claus' story. The movie is shot beautifully and I remember thinking it felt like a John Carpenter film, some may not think that's a compliment, but I really dig it. The acting isn't the greatest and the story is ridiculous, but for me, it's just the right amount of absurd.This is one of those movies that will always be on my list, it's one that I'll show my children. Love it.",8,1,2,13 February 2019
The Incredible Hulk," More like Meh Hulk
","Bruce Banner is back in Marvel's attempt at a second Incredible Hulk film.I remember watching the Eric Bana Hulk film when I was younger and thinking it was lackluster, I honestly did not expect this to be a sort of continuation on the storyline so I was pretty shocked that they decided to. I absolutely love Edward Norton, but I can't really see him as the Hulk, at least not the hulk that's supposed to fit into the extended MCU. His acting style seems too sharp and crass to be on the same stage as an RDJ or a Chris Evans. I'm not saying he couldn't do it, the contrary actually, I just think that his personality wouldn't have meshed.I did semi-enjoy the film, but just couldn't really get super excited about it, I felt like there were parts of the film that had promise, but for the most part, it just fell flat to me. Overall, I doubt I would watch this again and will probably skip it on my MCU re-watch binges in the future.",4,0,2,23 May 2019
The Hangover," Classic
","Classic. There isn't much else to say about this 'buddy' comedy in the heart of Sin City.This is one of my all-time favorite comedies. It has its moments of pure ridiculousness but when it shines it absolutely is BRILLIANT. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis really know how to round out a comedy and push the limits on what you thought was going to be just another run of the mill buddy movie.",10,2,2,22 May 2019
Iron Man 3," Tony-tastic
","Tony Stark gets drunk, hooks up with, what I think is a botanist, and then seals his fate forever.Guy Pearce plays a fantastic role as Aldrich Killian, personally though I love Guy Pearce so I was probably going to dig him no matter what. The only real downfall of this is the whole superpowers that all the villains have...I mean, I get that they had to escalate the level of people Tony is going against, but it seems just a little nuts. Also, the Vice President is involved because his daughter lost a leg? That's not even the worst thing that could happen...he's willing to basically throw his life away because of that? Still, a freaking great film and I'll definitely watch it again.",9,0,0,23 May 2019
Kung Fu Panda," EPIC.
","Honestly, love this movie. I don't care that it's a kids movie, the story is told so well and even though it came out years ago the graphics and the CGI are still to this day impressive. I remember when it initially came out that I fell in love with the art style and even know probably 9-10 years later I'm extremely impressed. I think Jack Black is hilarious as Poe and really sells the character. His comedic timing mixed with impressive visuals makes this movie a Must-See for children and adults.",8,0,0,2 January 2019
Star Trek," Made me into a Trekkie
","I have to be honest before I saw this film I had absolutely no attraction to the Star Trek franchise. I was never a 'Trekkie' and just didn't see the appeal in the story as a whole. After seeing this film, I'm honestly upset...at myself. Wow! What an amazing feat of storytelling.I know that this is not the 'original' Star Trek, but it did an amazing job introducing a new viewer to an already established franchise. As I watched I felt like I was not only learning the history of the series but being introduced to a fresh new story.The acting was done supremely and the cinematography was splendid. The only complaint I would have is the same that I know a lot of people had. LENS FLARES! I mean I get it, it's a cool effect, but sometimes they were showing up in places that made absolutely no sense.I will watch this movie again, as a matter of fact, I look forward to it.",9,1,7,22 February 2019
Iron Man 2," Fantastic.
","The sequel to the 2008 Box Office hit does not disappoint.The only real qualm that I had with the first Iron Man was a weak villain, thankfully the studio corrected that in this iteration of the Iron Man.Whiplash, Ivan Vanko, stands out as a worthy adversary in both the physical and intellectual field with Tony Stark, his meek upbringing contrasts nicely with the flashy and arrogant Tony making the dichotomy of the characters simply wonderful. You get this raw and vengeful character in Ivan and a flashy slick character from Tony that create the perfect amount of friction to start a fire. Sam Rockwell also plays Justin Hammer to perfection, but to be honest I'm just a HUGE Rockwell fan, if you haven't seen Moon...do yourself a favor.Fantastic MCU film that scratches a little deeper into the Avenger Initiative, will absolutely watch again.",10,0,0,23 May 2019
Zootopia," Must. Watch.
","Hands down, in my top 5 Disney movies. I would honestly say that this movie is an important movie for kids to watch. It has some very adult themes and very real topics that it explores.I will say that it has some dark moments that could possibly scare younger kids, but the adults will appreciate them. It's just nice to have a kids/teenager movie that isn't constantly song after song about something, plus Jason Bateman is just a powerhouse even when he's animated.This is a movie that I will watch over and over again. Absolutely recommend.",9,2,2,11 March 2019
Rocky V," Ultimately the soundtrack and the third act is this films demise.
","Honestly, this movie as a whole is not as terrible as everyone says, but the moments that are bad are atrocious. Essentially the first 27 minutes of the film are pretty fantastic, it looks and feels almost like a traditional Rocky movie. After that first 27 minutes though, it goes downhill pretty quickly. If you're a fan of the Rocky franchise, you still might enjoy it, otherwise...skip it.",6,2,3,6 January 2019
Happy Gilmore," Sandler's Best
","Happy Gilmore is, in my opinion, Sandler's best movie.It's the right amount of Sandler absurdity while mixing in honest true emotions every now and then. That coupled with the fact that the film gives us one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Golf antagonist of all time, Shooter McGavin. The polarizing attitudes of the two really sell this and make it a fun movie.For me, the only downfall of this movie is that we are supposed to believe that all it takes to be a golf pro is the ability to hit the ball really hard...I know, I know, that's what makes the movie comedic, but you can still have a comedy that exists in the real world (it's my opinion).A fantastic film and it's Sandler at absolute best will definitely watch again.",8,1,1,8 March 2019
Ready Player One," A Gamer's Dream
","A video gamers dream. As a gamer myself this movie is easily one of my new favorites, it shows creativity, the CGI is amazing, and honestly, I just freaking love the concept. I know that for the viewers who aren't avid gamers may not enjoy the movie (they'd be insane) mainly due to its deep dive into gaming culture.The clique nature of squads, clans, groups, whatever you want to call them. The deep seeded desire to dig for easter eggs and secrets. The fear of your 'avatar' dying and losing all of your (XP) or loot. Man, I just felt like every 5 minutes of this movie introduced another wave of gaming culture that I completely thirsted for.The only real qualm that I have with the film is the timeline of it. The creator of the game grew up playing things like Atari, but does that mean the movie is set in the present day or the very near future? I mean it's set in 2045, but that means that the creator of the world would have grown up playing the games of the early 90's/2000's which would have been the SNES/PS1 era, somewhere in there. However, in the film, they seem to reach into the 80's nostalgia. Maybe he just had really cool parents that wanted to immerse him in the games of olden days? Either way, who cares.GREAT FILM!",10,0,2,22 May 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A LOT OF FUN!
","Tom Holland's first outing as the famed SpiderMan. Personally I welcome his personality and spunk. I must admit I really loved Andrew Garfield and he really seemed to love the character. I think he was simply a victim of the wrong writers. The movie looks and feels fantastic! I LOVE Michael Keaton and was extremely pleased to see him suited up as the Falcon. The movie was fun, granted it's a Marvel movie so it's pretty tough for it not to come across as that way. I was putting this movie off, because I wasn't sure I would enjoy. That was a mistake on my part and one that I'm happy to have corrected.The sequence with Keaton and Holland in the vehicle was magnificent! Loved the building of tension, but I do hate that Keaton was able to figure out that Holland was Spiderman from just a few inconsequential details. I understand that they couldn't make it too on the nose, but still. Either way GREAT Sequence.",8,0,0,2 January 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain Awesome
","He's back, my favorite Avenger...and this time he's facing his toughest opponent yet, his best friend.To be honest, it's a pretty great film and I'd definitely watch it again.",8,0,2,23 May 2019
Rocky II," Fantastic!
","This movie really deserves a 10/10 but for the sake of not being overly ambitious, I'm going 9. Rocky II is an incredible movie, I believe it has the perfect blend of story and sports. Honestly, I'm underselling it. The love story between Rocky and Adrian is hands down the best part of the film, as a matter of fact, I find myself growing bored near the climatic ending fight. I am much more interested in Rocky as a person rather than Rocky as a fighter and that is the true victory in this story.",9,0,0,2 January 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Best MCU Hero
","Hands down my favorite of all the MCU films. It might not be the strongest character, but the story is just so amazing.I am a huge WWII fanatic so to see the setting and the story arc of the Rogers character is so uplifting. He is one of the MCU characters that is just so pure. He stands up for what he believes in and never backs down.Now, I wouldn't say that Captain America is the best Marvel hero, but his personality, his belief system they all are so strong that it just makes you root for him. Hugo Weaving as Red Skull is mesmerizing, personally, I don't think there is a character that he can't do. Especially if that character is supposed to be menacing and villainous.I will definitely re-watch this film over and over again.",10,0,0,22 May 2019
Burn After Reading," It was alright?
","This political comedy(?) was hot and cold for me. I had moments where I truly enjoyed it (mostly starring Brad Pitt) and moments where I actually kind of hated it (primarily starring Brad Pitt). It was so all over the place and a little disjointed for me, but overall it was an enjoyable film.I don't know if this is a movie that I would recommend to a majority of my friends, but I would definitely recommend it to those who are politically inclined.",6,0,0,22 May 2019
Wanted," WANTED a better storyline, but still fun.
","James McAvoy brings a dynamic performance as Wesley Gibson, making it all too believable that he is merely an office worker bee. I think this movie really hits a chord with anyone who has ever had to be a 'grinder' or a desk jockey. I know for me, as I watched this movie unfold I so desperately WANTED to find myself in Wesley's shoes. I think he's a character that almost anyone can relate to, perhaps not always but at least once in your life, you've been a Wesley.The plot of the 'Fraternity' is definitely out there and is where this movie takes a big hit in terms of my rating. I just think, 'textile works used binary code to figure out who should be killed?' What?! Does that seem absurd? Well, that's because it ABSOLUTELY IS.The saving grace for me with this film is the incredible CGI and the extremely inventive action sequences, I found myself in awe of the ways they portrayed some of the shooting sequences. I loved this movie secretly, but couldn't get past a train-wreck of a plot.",7,0,2,23 January 2019
Rocky IV," Favorite Boxing Movie.
","The opening shot of the two boxing gloves exploding is the worst part of this movie, well that and the stupid robot, after that it's pure GOLD. Dolph Lundgren is definitely the greatest opponent that Rocky has faced, he's a cold-blooded punch throwing machine. I love that Drago spends a majority of the movie as a silent antagonist to Rocky's more outspoken protagonist. Rocky IV is a far step from the original Rocky, this adventure feels far more like a modern sports film rather than a gritty story that Rocky I & II offered. It's a fun, fast, testosterone boosted thrill-ride.",9,1,1,2 January 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Amazing.
","This movie is good and that's not bad, it will never be bad and that is good. This is in my top three all-time great Disney movies. It blends just about everything I love together, the video game component, the heartfelt story, the underdog aspect. I mean this movie is absolutely amazing. John C. Reilly plays Ralph so well, and his story is written so tragically that you can't help but feel sorry for him.I implore you to watch this movie.",10,1,1,15 March 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A Must Watch for any Desk Jockey
","The only real downfall of this movie for me is the product placement that happens occasionally, other than that I absolutely love the way this was shot. Perhaps it's merely just the fact that I see so much of myself in Walter Mitty, as I imagine a lot of professional desk jockey's do. It's just such a fun story and told so beautifully. Ben Stiller isn't always the greatest, but for me, this is his best work.The true hero of this film is the cinematography, granted they have exotic gorgeous locations to work with, but they are executed to near perfection. This movie is just simply inspiring.",10,1,2,20 January 2019
A Quiet Place," No clue why people don't like this movie.
","Personally, I think this is an amazing movie. It takes a lot for a movie to have virtually no dialogue yet tell such a tense and emotional story. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt both bring so much to the table on this one and just absolutely blew me away. Many people are saying people made dumb decisions, but honestly I can't think of too many situations where I thought they were dumb.",10,2,4,5 January 2019
Ex Machina," Excellent.
","What is there to say except, wow. This movie was a whirlwind of a ride and boy I want to buy another ticket!First off the cinematography was absolutely brilliant. Every scene felt so delicately calculated. The use of color, ingenious. Every scene felt so immersive and rich. The music? A masterclass in the use of audio and music. This film is a contender for 'top ten' for me. It's such an important look at what could be the possible future of all of us and is told so well. The movie absolutely kept me wanting more.The only negative I would say would be for the Protagonist not wanting more information. I feel like they glossed over some scenes and I would have loved even more backstory. I think the core story is put together so nicely and my critique is really just my insatiable desire for more.Please watch this film, I will again.",10,1,2,13 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Entertainment
","Such a fun ride. I absolutely love Chris Pratt in this movie, one of his funniest roles and he actually has a few moments of raw sincerity that really shines in this movie. This is a great MCU movie that just really hits home while being so many galaxies away. I absolutely love Bradley Coopers 'Rocket' and the CGI done throughout the film is absolutely stunning, especially the establishing shots of interstellar locations. The movie has a few crass moments, but other than those this is a great watch for the whole family.",10,0,0,23 January 2019
The Imitation Game," Beautiful.
","This movie was masterfully done.I wasn't aware of the Enigma until watching this film, but after watching it I went down the deepest rabbit hole on cryptography and ciphers that a human can probably go. I mean, I was reading so much I finally realized why Nicolas Cage felt compelled to steal the Declaration of Independence.The story was so powerful, I will caveat that statement with the fact that I'm a HUGE WWII nerd, Alan Turing is such an incredible influence to technology and his exploration of the medium in a time where people weren't exploring that field is absolutely inspiring.I loved the film and thought that Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job, his portrayal came across as believable and genuine. It shows a very important part of both the technology and its importance and the social aspects of what was happening at the time.I hope that more people will choose to watch this film because it truly is an important piece.",10,0,1,29 March 2019
The Hangover Part II," You've seen it in Vegas...It happens again in Thailand.
","The Wolfpack is BACK! This time they take on Bangkok in a whirlwind of lapsed memories and booze-filled antics.I must say I went into this film not exactly knowing what to expect. I absolutely loved the first film, it is honestly one of my all-time favorite comedies. This movie follows the same formula as the last, they drink, they forget, they figure it out. I was actually slightly disappointed that they followed the plot structure so directly from the first movie...it seems a little lazy to me, but I also think, hey it worked last time why not go for it again!The 'three best friends that anyone could have' work well together, as they did last time, for me the biggest downfall of the film is the location and the experiences they go through.I feel like in the first movie they did a great job of explaining everything thing that occurred through the evening, in this one, it just sort of comes in waves and seems all over the place. They didn't address the fact that the character from the wedding chapel was in this one? I mean I get it, he's supposed to be a different person, but these dudes wouldn't have stopped and been like, 'Don't I know you?'Also, they spend the entire film searching for Teddy and when they finally find him he's totally cool with everything? That makes zero sense to me, he was never relaxed before all this happened and he's been locked in an elevator for almost 2 whole days, Lord knows he's got a crazy infection on that hand.Overall, the movie still has some great laughs and a few outrageous moments. I would rather watch the first one, but I'd watch this one again.",6,1,2,24 May 2019
Total Recall," I Rekall watching this film
","Old Quaid just couldn't stop asking questions!I absolutely love this film and to be honest the VFX in this movie still impress me, especially when you think about the capacity of the film. I love the story, love the concept, and it's oddly one of Schwarzenegger's best films, but I would surmise that to be because he's playing a man who doesn't understand what's going on...Schwarzenegger really nails that.This movie is awesome! I'll definitely watch it again. Can't give it higher than what I did in score though because it has a few moments that are wacky. Also, I definitely think he died at Rekall.",7,1,1,22 May 2019
Limitless," Amazing story.
","This is creative storytelling. This is the kind of movie that you watch and just get lost in the story, you get so enamored with everything that is happening that once it's over you start researching.It's honestly the kind of movie that when I watch it makes me want to be a better person, to strive for more, and it does it in a way that is fresh and that feels great. I will say that there are a few moments that semi-date it (primarily the CGI moments) but aside from that the story is just riveting and enthralling.It would go on my list as a must watch for anyone that wants to write, produce, etc. It's just phenomenal. Will definitely watch it again.",10,0,0,24 May 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Awesome.
","My favorite part of this film is the Kurt Russell CGI making him appear young...WOW. It's next level.Such a great story and to be honest I absolutely love what this means for Star-Lord, making him half-human and half-God...CRAZY! I'll definitely watch this again.",8,1,1,23 May 2019
Rocky III," A Classic.
","Rocky III, aka, Mr. T party. I love the Rocky series and I truly believe that Sylvester Stallone gets overlooked as an actor because of some of the cheesy (b) movies he did as an actor, but in this series, he really gets the opportunity to show his acting chops. This one definitely doesn't have the same vigor or gusto as the previous two, but his foe is definitely more formidable. They made more of the emphasis on fighting in this one, which I do think almost tarnishes the story arc built so well from the previous films. This movies shining moment though is when Rocky and Adrian are standing on the beach and Rocky breaks down to Adrian that he's afraid. Truly a powerful moment in an otherwise overly macho movie. Would/Will watch again.",7,0,0,2 January 2019
Thor," Great Character, lackluster story.
","The Great and Mighty Thor falls from Odin's grace in this mythical adventure in the MCU.It's the first time we are introduced to otherworldly concepts and types of transportation such as the Bifrost in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth, in my opinion, is the perfect Thor. He plays the role so well and also looks the part beautifully. For me, this is the second weakest of the entry-level MCU movies.It's a great story and really explains Thor's character development, which is truly important for his future in the MCU, but it just isn't extremely strong in terms of story. I think the other biggest downfall is the town that they are in, I read that the town was created for the movie and it honestly looks like it. I know that's a petty thing, but it just really sticks out to me. I also feel like Thor's progression from this crass & arrogant person to a noble and gallant person was super fast! I mean literally in the matter of a few days he realizes his years of folly? I suppose the argument could be made that as a 'God' he can see it and adjust quicker.Either way, I still love the film and would watch it again.",6,1,2,23 May 2019
The Shape of Water," I mean...it's kind of whack.
","I went into this film with extremely high hopes because the movie was raved about by so many people. I have to say though, I was slightly disappointed.It was shot absolutely beautifully. The aesthetics and the environments were all supremely done, they had this otherworldly sense to them that was enthralling and captivating. You can tell they didn't hold back at any point on the sets or the environments.The storytelling was also done beautifully, I loved how they seemed to humanize these 'top secret' situations by inserting everyday idle chit chat. It made the situation that normally would be grand seem so trivial, this made everything seem so utterly believable.Now I'm sure you're reading all of this and wondering, 'Why were you disappointed?' Well, for me, there were just things in the movie that didn't make a ton of sense to me, the sexual scenes for instance...why were they there? Not the ones with the 'creature', but the others. If you subtracted them from the film, it doesn't take anything away from it. Perhaps, they were trying to humanize these characters by showing them in their most intimate settings? I can sort of understand that, but it kind of just comes across as odd to me.Perhaps I'm being too critical of the scenes, I was expecting this movie to be something slightly different so I must admit my opinion is slightly skewed.The storytelling and environments and the performances make this movie a GREAT watch, but sadly I can't say it's a MUST watch.",5,2,6,3 March 2019
Iron Man," Tony Stark Kills It.
","Tony Stark, what can I say? Except, you freaking rock!In the MCU's first film Tony really blasts off the screen in more ways than one. The only real fault that I have this film is the villain, not that Obadiah Stane (Iron Monger) isn't a worthy adversary and Jeff Bridges is always amazing. I just felt that the back story as to why it is that he's selling munitions to extremists isn't covered very well.It just sort of happens...and why exactly did he want to kill Tony? I mean jealousy? Also, couldn't he have killed him in a million different ways? Hiring mercenaries seems...lazy.Still, a fantastic movie and it's apart of a collection of films I'll watch over and over.",9,0,1,22 May 2019
Creed II," Great, but could have been so much more.
","Fantastic film, but it honestly left me wanting more.First, I really DID NOT like the CGI elements they added to this film, I know they weren't crazy abundant, but it seemed like every chance they got in a fight they felt like they had to make the arena seem larger than life? I didn't fully understand that, I mean I know they didn't want to probably hire a bunch of extras for scenes...but what stopped them before? I mean it's apart of the Rocky universe.Second, I don't necessarily understand the entire Drago saga? I understand that perhaps he would have had some backlash for losing to Rocky Balboa, but Rocky is arguably (probably) the greatest boxer in the history of the sport. Wouldn't, in time, the Russian government is accepting of the fact that their guy lost...I mean look at Rocky's resume.Third, I think the film really missed the mark on the whole point of the story. Obviously, this whole film is about the redemption of Apollo, but wasn't Apollo not there for Adonis? Don't get me wrong, I don't want to smear the Creed name, I'm a huge Apollo fan. The story though could have explored the feelings of resentment that Adonis may hold towards his father. I mean, what if when Drago shows up and they bring up the Father aspect, what if Adonis would have been like, 'Screw him, he wasn't there for me'. They really could have explored that.Then you have a Rocky swing in and talk about the importance of Father-son (yadda yadda yada). You have Adonis see the fault of his ways and agree to the fight. Ok, this is where things get tricky...you don't have them fight twice. Let's face it that whole, lose then redeem yourself, kind of became lame after Rocky III. You have them fight in just one fight, however during this fight, Adonis can see that Viktor is struggling to win, but he is doing it for his FATHER. Adonis then finishes the fight but acknowledges that in some weird way Viktor and he are the same on a bunch of levels.OBVIOUSLY, my version of it has a lot of holes...don't pick it apart lol. I did enjoy this movie and I'll more than likely watch it again.",8,0,1,17 April 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Thor?
","One of the slowest and dullest movies in the MCU.I love Thor and his entire story, but this movie just kind of drags...the best part of this film is the redeeming factor of Loki, other than that it's just a little out of whack. I think that they needed to introduce the aether, or the reality stone, but I felt like they lacked in the story, but that's just my opinion.I'd be ok if I didn't watch this one again.",5,0,0,23 May 2019
RED," It could have been more.
","Bruce Willis is in his classic form in Red, plays it cool as a former 'agent'. The ensemble cast is enjoyable at moments and really plays together nicely, but I feel like there were just too many convenient characters/scenarios.Why in movies like this is there ALWAYS an answer, they always knew a 'person' who can help them? I understand they did a good job tying every character together, but it almost seemed like there was NO scenario they couldn't get out of. Which, I also understand, is part of the enjoyment of the film, but after so many aha moments, it sort of becomes a cliche.I ultimately enjoyed the movie but felt like there needed to be more stressful scenarios.",6,0,0,27 January 2019
The Purge," Not as bad as others declare...
","Aside from the insanity behind the idea of a purge, the movie was quite excellent. I wish they would have gone a little deeper into what exactly the purge means for all of America and how it came to be. I feel like they were sub-par at building tension, don't get me wrong there were tense moments, but some moments came across as mere jump scares when they really could have dragged out the tension.",7,1,3,3 January 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Bloody Good Fun
","Such a fun take on the modern world of espionage. The cinematography in this film was done beautifully and the action sequences in this film are so amazingly executed. I appreciate a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and this movie knows how to portray the class that feels like British royalty, but the comedic humor of all classes. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) really excels in this movie and is truly an underdog worth cheering for. I loved the soundtrack and the use of color throughout the film.",9,1,2,16 January 2019
Aladdin," One of the best animated movies ever.
","One of my favorite Disney Classics, I remember as a child this was the movie that made me truly love Robin Williams, his portrayal of the Genie was hilarious. The movie has a great message and I remember as a kid not really understanding it completely, but as an adult, I truly appreciate that I was being bombarded with messages like the one this one presents. Also, Jafar is an extremely intimidating antagonist and the character is done to perfection, especially the whole snake sequence...still gives me the creeps.Love this movie and will definitely watch it again.",8,2,3,12 March 2019
The Nice Guys," The GREAT Guys
","I absolutely love this film, truly hilarious and the acting is superb. The setting for the film is excellent, I can't imagine it being any more successful in any other time period. Ryan Gosling is at his absolute best in this film bringing forward his great acting with excellent comedic timing and grandeur. I wish they would do a sequel to this movie, it truly is an underrated piece of film, it's too bad that it performed so poorly at the box office, would love to see a sequel.",10,1,2,16 January 2019
