The Blair Witch Project," I didn't felt like this in a long, long, time...
","Well, what can i say about the movie that scared me the most in the last 5.000 years? :)I guess that by now everyone has heard of it... some people liked it, some don't. I'm one of those that loved it.First, the movie has this 'feeling' of reality, that convincing look, that strange resemblance with the everyday people and live. I found that kind of 'ambience' in only one more feature: The Simpsons TV series, although for completely different reasons.In the Simpsons, i think that the sounds and the voice acting were extremely reality-inducing.In TBWP, every part of it (picture, sound, acting, improvising) transpires a strange sense of real life happenings, that no special effects can buy...The movie is quite slow for some time, i must admit. But thats part of its 'magic': the viewer must be given the change to 'relate' with the characters, to know then, to care for them.I think that it didn't work for some people, but then again, some people loved Holywood's Godzila, which show us that we are all different from each other... :)Anyway, the last 20 or 15 minutes are the most dense and mind blowing piece of movie that i've seen for quite some time... i actualy got scare a couple of times, even though we don't see much 'explicities' on the screen. Its our own mind that scare us.Just to finish this lenghty review, i would like to say that the ending is just p-e-r-f-e-c-t, a wonderfull climax to those last 20 minutes of adrenaline and worries.My advice? See it like if it was something that popped up on the evening news, let yourself be 'absorbed' by its reality, and forget all those teen-slashing flicks",10,2,3,3 August 2000
