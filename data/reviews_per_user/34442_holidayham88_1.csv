Come and See," Brutal !!
","I love war movies, although this was much more different than the usual movies I normally see. I watched this film in my Film class and its the first I've never seen. come and see shows more emotion and scare to the audience. the expressions you see in this movie is quite disturbing and real. you can see the struggle people during the world war 2 had to go through and what the Russians had to experience. you can see in this movie that the characters thrive for freedom. The movie tackles the other emotional glands in your body. the disturbing images and scenes tell you that war is not pretty, and there is more to just shooting guns at your enemy. scary, chilling is what you will encounter if you watch this film.",7,1,2,13 June 2009
