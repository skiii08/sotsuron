Raiders of the Lost Ark," Go Indy
","Harrison Ford continues his role of Han Solo but instead of space, it is set in the 30's. This is a perfect time to set the film because it was the time when people explored the world, as it was opening up more to them with the invention of the plane. They especially liked to explore old civilisations and dig up archaeological finds.Indiana Jones is instantly recognisable with his whip, hat and leather jacket. What is interesting about him is we see him fight and do all those incredible stunts and yet his one fear is snakes.It was such a brilliant idea to have the Nazis as the bad guys and have them after important artifacts such as the Ark of the title which would make them invincible. They are the ultimate villains who the audience would boo and root for Indy to win, it is a classic Good Vs. Evil battle.The stunts and special effects are mind-blowing. I was very impressed at how they did the scene where the faces melted away, it was so convincing and it is more inspiring to know they didn't have the technology they have today to do those scenes.There have been complaints that this doesn't show archaeology in the right way, it is not as exciting as the film but to fair, they couldn't do what the real archaeologists do because the audience wouldn't find it interesting to watch for 111 minutes.The film has everything- romance, comedy, action and adventure which appeals to me.",10,1,2,23 May 2007
Minority Report," Edge of the seat action
","Minority Report is one of the best sci-fi/action film that I have seen in a while, it is in the same vein as Blade Runner.The story is a very interesting one. In the future, they can predict murders before they happen (who will be the murderer and who the victim) but as the film proves it doesn't matter how perfect the system looks, it still has flaws and can be used unscrupulously by someone with a bad agenda which happens in the case of John Cruise's character John Anderton. He lost his son and he believes in the system and even enforces it but it isn't till it is used against him that he realises it is not a perfect system.The special effects are amazing and the action really does have you on the edge of your seat. I like that the film is very unpredictable, you really don't know how it will end especially when Anderton is faced with the man he thinks took his son and you wonder if he will really kill the man. Also, you wonder how Anderton will get out of the situation when everything is against him and you are really left wondering right up to the end of the film how it will be resolved and how Max Von Sydow (Lemar) will be brought to justice, I really enjoyed the twist at the end.",9,0,1,1 July 2009
Star Trek," Didn't think they could do it
","It wasn't that I had any preconceived ideas that the film would be awful, I decided I wouldn't judge it before I went to see it but I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed the film and thought for once the modern take on the classic popular series and films was a success and really improved on the franchise and brand of Star Trek.Congratulations to everyone on this film, particularly J.J. Abrams who directed the film and the actors who portrayed these well known characters- Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock), Karl Urban (Bones), Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Simon Pegg (Scotty), John Cho (Sulu) and Anton Yelchin (Chekov) and the casting department. The right actors were picked for the characters, although some may not look like who they are supposed to be, you can't imagine any other actors playing the roles, they are not caricatures of the characters they are playing, they add something new and yet something familiar at the same time.I will admit I didn't like some of the changes that happened in the time line that differed from the original plot line in Star Trek, plus I wasn't really sure about the romance between Spock and Uhura but I don't think the film should be condemned for that and who knows what will happen, they could do another film and it could go back to the way it was or go a different path, as long as it carries on Star Trek's spirit, I'm sure it will do alright.I really enjoyed this film especially seeing the character development of Spock and Kirk as individuals but also as a partnership beginning and it was brilliant to see Leonard Nimoy in the film and I really hope there will be more films that follow on from this one because it would be such a shame if this to be the only modern take take on Star Trek.Well done everyone on Star Trek, brilliant film, enjoyed it more than I thought I would.",9,1,7,29 May 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Mixed feelings about the film
","I was really looking forward to watching this film as everyone was raving about what a brilliant scary film it was. What also made me want to watch the film was that it was made in Britain and until recently, there has been real surge of horror films made in Britain which I am glad about.I was a little disappointed when I finished watching it. It wasn't rubbish but it wasn't excellent. I think what has left me with mixed feelings about Shaun of the dead is the film seems to be mainly a comedy and there are some very funny bits which I will get back to in a minute. The thing is all these funny things happen and you're laughing away and then the film changes tact and becomes more serious with Shaun having to kill his mum after she is beaten by a zombie and then Dianne and David being killed by the zombies, it just didn't sit right for the film to suddenly go down this route when basically for most of the film we were laughing at the antics of the zombies and I just couldn't get back into the film after seeing him kill his own mother. I even wondered because the violence involved towards the end if it would turn out to be all a dream but it wasn't to be. I feel like the film couldn't decide what genre it was going to be and if it was to be more horror driven, then there should not have been as much comedy as there was so in that respect I think the film let itself down there.The other part of me liked the film especially at the start when we see that we are in a way zombies ourselves. We all go to work, queue in lines, go shopping without really thinking about what we are doing.I love the fact that Shaun is an anti-hero in this. He is in a job that is mundane and no-one respects him there. He spends all his time going to the pub and just drinking and isn't interested in doing anything else. Then London's population starts to turn into zombies and he becomes a leader who the others turn to, to get them out of the situation they are in and he finds himself battling zombies and becoming the most unlikely hero you have ever seen on film.I was in stitches with the humour especially when the zombies are introduced into the story line. I have mentioned down below my favourite humorous scenes. One scene is when Shaun and Ed have Shaun's record collection and they are debating about what records to throw at zombies while the zombies are coming towards them. Two, Shaun introducing his girlfriend to his mother when they are trying to get away from the zombies. Three, Shaun's gang meeting up with Yvonne's gang who are basically the same type of characters but played by well-known television actors that have worked with Shaun's (Simon Pegg) gang in other television programmes. Classic! The last is the duke box playing Queen's 'Don't Stop me now' when they are beating up the zombie landlord with pool cues.I think the zombie make up works so well and is so convincing and I like the fact the film doesn't take itself too seriously.",7,1,5,4 June 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Hooray, Jack is back
","For me, what stands out most is the amazing stunts performed in the film, this includes when the crew are held prisoner in wooden, round cages, Sparrow trying to escape while being tied to a pole and the sword fight on the moving wheel.The locations are even more spectacular than the first film.Jack is back to his old tricks, this time having to deal with two dangerous enemies Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), the perfect pantomime villains that you can boo and hiss at.Keira Knightley is given more depth to her character and even engages in a sword fight. I liked that they had developed her character from the first one where she started off sheltered and helpless in a way and in this one, she's not afraid to defend herself from attack and even going on her own to find Will.What a brilliant ending to have Barbossa come back into it as I really enjoyed the competing that went on with Jack and Barbossa in the first film so it was good news to see him back in it.",9,0,1,14 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The gem of the franchise
","I can't believe they based the film on the Pirate ride at Disney (I have to confess, it is my favourite ride at the Magic Kingdom). I thought it was genius they could do a 143 minute film and have a plot that wasn't light and had plenty of weight to it.Out of the three movies, this is my favourite.It was the first film in a while to tackle pirates and cover all the key elements of pirate movies in the past- lovely locations, a love story that had the right amount of attention but wasn't the main focus of the plot, great action sequences. Then this film updated it in such a way that modern audiences wouldn't be put off watching this type of film which probably happened in the past as they just didn't know how to make a successful pirate film to appeal to their audience at the time. I thought it was an interesting idea to have the pirates cursed and that they couldn't be killed.The cast was brilliant, I loved the romance between Elizabeth and Will but who I enjoyed watching the most was obviously Johnny Depp. He had a really fantastic idea about making Jack Sparrow very rock n' roll and basing him on Keith Richards. He played him just right and probably made him the first anti-hero in a while that the audience was interested in watching and rooting for.The film really does have it all- stunning locations, really breathtaking. A very unique plot with many twists and turns. Unforgettible characters, incredible and scary special effects and exciting sword fights.",10,2,5,14 July 2009
Beauty and the Beast," My favourite of all Disney films
","This is my favourite of all the Disney films, I just love all the aspects of the film- the music, the story, the characters and the animation.It has stayed a favourite of mine since I first watched it on video. Beauty and the Beast has always been one of my favourite fairy tales and the film does justice to the spirit of the story. I really like the characters, I don't think there was one that I didn't like but my favourites have to be Belle voiced by Paige O'Hara, Lumiere voiced by Jerry Orbach and Cogsworth voiced by David Ogden Stiers.The songs also make the film what it is, they are so catchy and you can't stop yourself singing along to these wonderful, jolly songs.The animation is amazing and I know how so much has happened since the film came out and the technology has moved on considerably but it was breathtaking at the time particularly the ball room scene which has been talked about a lot and quite rightly.It is a good film to watch when you have had a bad day, it is sure to brighten your day up again.",10,3,4,29 June 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," On the fence with this one
","By this film, I had enough of the up and down relationship between Elizabeth and Will, I was fed up with them as a couple and individually.Why I kept watching was because of Captain Jack Sparrow as he was still the only one that kept me entertained. I did enjoy the rivalry between Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack (Johnny Depp). It was so funny to watch them have a battle of wits against one another and compete for ownership of the Black Pearl.It was brilliant to finally have Keith Richards in this third film, he was well worth the wait and really looked good as a pirate.All the loose ends in Pirates 2 were tied up. Finally Will and Elizabeth married but I didn't care by this point. Davy Jones was killed and the crew released from their bonds and Cutler Beckett got his come-uppance.As usual Johnny Depp is on top form and for me, again steals the show, really loved the scene where he escapes from Beckett's ship and the scene where he is in the locker going a bit mad with a crew made up entirely of Jack Sparrows.The special effects really pushed the envelope particularly the storm scene which was so convincing and action packed.",7,0,1,14 July 2009
Sleepy Hollow," Another successful collaboration of Depp and Burton
","The story is set in 1799, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a policeman in New York City who is different from his colleagues, he is far ahead of them in using science to solve crimes and not just using inhumane methods that the police in this time favour. His superiors send him to an isolated farming community called Sleepy Hollow where a series of gruesome murders have happened, victims have been found without their heads. The town council members tell Crane that a headless Hessian horseman is responsible for the crimes but Crane doesn't believe them and thinks it is a person alive who has killed the town's people but his beliefs are soon tested when he witnesses the headless horseman killing the Magistrate (Richard Griffiths). Crane carries on and finds a conspiracy that has been going on with the town council members who are now being killed and Crane must find the horseman's head to stop the killings.Tim Burton immediately sets the mood of the film by making it very dark and Gothic which he always seems to be very good at doing. Danny Elfman helps Burton's direction with his music which just adds to the tension in the film.One of the things I like about Johnny Depp's character Ichabod crane is that he is not your stereotypical hero, he is completely different from any other hero you have seen on film before. He is not macho, he is squeamish, he faints and is very eccentric compared to everyone else but it is only Depp that can make you watch a character like that and not be turned off by his feeble qualities. We see flashbacks of his traumatic childhood where his father was this fearsome man of God and his mother was a free spirit who was murdered by his father because he saw his wife as an evil witch.The film keeps you guessing till the end. There is the secret that connects all the town council members and the victims of the horseman, the audience find that out in the middle of the film but it is also who is it killing the town's people? Is it an evil spirit or someone who is using the headless horseman to get their revenge on these people? There is misdirection about who it is, Burton puts a red herring in that it is Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) till we find out at the end, it is Katrina's stepmother (Miranda Richardson)who wanted revenge on the Van Garrets and Van Tassels who threw her family out and the people who stand in the way of her getting what she wants.What is good about the end is Depp at the beginning of the film starts off as a loner but at the end of the film he has a family, Katrina and Young Masbeth (Marc Pickering) who share two things with one another, they have no living family left and have witnessed the events of Sleepy Hollow and who can never tell anyone else as they won't be believed especially in that time so can rely on one another as they have bonded over the horrors they saw in Sleepy Hollow.Another interesting part of the film is that Crane uses science techniques that are unheard of in that era the film is set but it shows him as someone who has a modern approach to solving crimes, very much the way they are solved today. I have never seen this before in a period film and I think it was a good touch to show how brutal life was before the science techniques came into force and how people were bullied into signing confessions using brute force and torture back in the past.The cast are amazing. Christopher Walken scares the bejesus out of me in his make up and looks so menacing as the headless horseman.The special effects blew my mind, especially in scenes where it looks like a character has actually been decapitated and the scene where the horseman gets his head back and you see all the veins, tissue and skin building on the skull till the transformation is complete and you are looking at Christopher Walken, back from the dead. The writing by Kevin Yagher/Andrew Kevin Walker just makes this Ichabod more better and interesting than the other films which have featured the Crane character. I would also like to mention the Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and Film Editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron who just helped to make the film first rate.",10,0,1,29 April 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," I can't imagine any other actors playing these roles
","Out of the two films Redford and Newman did, this is my favourite out of the two. Redford and Newman just fit the roles of Cassidy and the Sundance Kid like a glove and they gel so well together on the film. I really can't imagine anyone else playing the roles as well as they did. I really enjoyed the interaction between the two, Cassidy (Newman) has the best lines and in character is the lighter of the two and Sundance Kid (Redford) is darker and hard and you really see the contrasts of the characters, how they deal with situations differently.I have always been fascinated about the wild west legends and this film kept me engaged in the story from start to finish. I particularly thought the scene where George Roy Hill superimpose Redford, Newman and Ross's image on old film was amazing and he and the editor did such a good job of making the actors part of the scene that you couldn't tell it was fake.There are a lot of brilliant and iconic scenes in the movie which are my favourites, some include Cassidy and Sundance jumping off a cliff, robbing the train, the fight between Cassidy and Harvey, Cassidy and Sundance fleeing their pursuers and the gun fight at the end. It just works on so many levels, the casting, direction, editing and story.",10,3,5,2 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," All the loose ends tied up
","There is a lot of criticism about this film because of the ewoks which I think is unfair. I think it adds a new level to the film because it is all about how advanced the world is where Luke, Leia and Han come from so it is refreshing to see a civilisation who is still primitive and hasn't evolved, their weapons are sticks with sharp points. I think it works because the ewoks look so cute and don't look like a threat but they are underestimated because they are resourceful with what they have and the fact they are little fighters who will defend their home even if they don't have the resources the empire have.I do think it is a bit creepy to find out that Leia and Luke are brother and sister especially after them kissing in The Empire strikes back.What I have problems with is the ending where Vader is supposed to turn Luke over to the emperor but kills the emperor instead after he sees his son being tortured. It is hard to belief that this man who chopped his son's hand off would finally do something good and save his son.It is compelling when Luke takes Vader's helmet off because for the first two films he hid himself behind this mask and imposing presence and then to see him as a weak and feeble person is shocking.The film ends on a high note, good has won and Luke has managed to save his father's soul before he died. The loose ends are tied up and you feel it has been all covered and there is no angle which Lucas hasn't resolved.",9,0,1,10 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Bloody Marvellous
","Let's be honest this was a hard subject to make into a musical and then a film but both Stephen Sondheim and Tim Burton did it. The reason being the real Sweeney Todd was a man of the times he was born into where society was not compassionate about their fellow man especially the lower classes and Sweeney Todd had no redeeming character traits so I can understand how the character changed into being someone who had been cruelly taken away from his family and sent far away and the audience can understand his need for vengeance against the men who did this to him Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall).The film is another successful collaboration of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. I have yet to see them make a bad movie together.Johnny Depp is as usual, amazing. He is one of the most gifted actors I have ever seen. He plays Todd as this man who is just holding onto his sanity but who looks like he could explode at any minute and when he does its just as frightening the coldness of his gaze when he is killing his customers to when he erupts into anger. He gives such an intense performance but also sings beautifully and seems to relish the singing side of the film as much as the dialogue.Tim Burton has done it again. He clearly understood the character and story which shows in the whole set-up of the movie from the cinematography, set design, costumes and actors. I love the Gothic feel to the production which is so attractive especially when he subtly introduces a little bit of colour to each scene.The music was unbelievable, well done to Stephen Sondheim who covers the whole spectrum of moods and emotions in the songs. My particular favourite was when Sweeney Todd is singing about having his vengeance, I can't remember the name of the song. When I heard that the film would be a musical it put me off but I'm glad I went because I realised it worked better in a musical format then just having the actors talk.I can't imagine any other actress pulling off Mrs. Lovett accept Helena Bonham Carter who just fits the role like a glove.Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall remind me of typical pantomime villains that you love to boo at. They seem to relish the meat of their characters as it shows in their performances. The person who surprised me the most was Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Aldolfo Pirelli who shows he can act along side the more established performers.The gore is not as bad as you would think, the blood was so bright that it reminded me of the old vampire movies where they made the blood so theatrical that there was nothing to be scared about. In fact, the scene I found the most scary was Todd throwing Mrs. Lovett in the furnace.I wasn't surprised when the beggar woman turned out to be Sweeney's wife because I had guessed this but was shocked at the climax of the movie when Todd killed her quickly and without thought and then realised he had killed the wife he loved and who he had never gotten over. A sad ending but I was glad Todd's character died the way he did and not at the end of a rope like the real Sweeney Todd.",10,5,9,2 March 2008
Glory," Very emotional film to watch
","I find it sad that no-one really knew about the 54th Maschusetts till this film came out. I certainly had no idea about the 54th and never knew there were black soldiers fighting in the war which to me is shocking. Those soldiers may not have taken Fort Wagner but they were brave and didn't flinch from the duty they volunteered for, no matter the treatment they endured by their own side.The film has many multi-layered strands that are explored in this movie. One, this had never been done before, black soldiers fighting in the war and they had a lot more to prove than the white soldiers. Totally unfair. Two, they had death threats from the Confederate Army who said they would not capture them but kill them on sight. Three, the racism they faced in their own army. The Northerners liked to think they were better than the Southerners because they didn't have slaves and they would never treat them the way the Southerners did but they were just as bad as the South and this is shown in the film when the black soldiers are denied boots, uniforms, they are used for manual labour and don't see any fighting and are given less wages than the white soldiers. Then we have the stories of soldiers where we see them grow into completely different people to when the film started. The actors are in one word, brilliant. I can't stop raving about them. I wouldn't like to say more because I can't put into any other meaningful words how well they fit into the characters.Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) finds himself overwhelmed with the responsibility of getting the men up to the task but at times finds himself doubting his abilities. There has been made mention Broderick's age and acting in this film but he was the perfect actor to play the role. For one, he looks like Shaw and for another, he was about the age Shaw was when he was given command. He plays Shaw just right, not too understated and not too over the top.Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) is the wise man who is like a father figure to the soldiers who rely on him and also Shaw looks to Rawlins for his advice on the men.Trip (Denzel Washington) starts off defiant. He wants to fight in the war but he also is scarred by his past as a slave and doesn't trust Shaw or any other white man. I didn't think I would feel any compassion about him as he is nasty to some of his fellow soldiers but I grew to like him very much and you see a softer side to him near the end when he admits to his fellow soldiers they are the only family he has now. I like to think at the end, he trusted Shaw because he picks up the colours which he said he didn't want to do when asked by Shaw earlier in the film.Thomas (Andre Braugher) is a free black man who has lived in the North for most, if not, all of his life. He has never been a slave but is well educated and finds himself an outsider in the regiment because he has had an easier life then his fellow soldiers but you see him grow up in this film, he starts off as a little boy but by the end of it, he is a man who can face anything.Major Forbes (Cary Elwes) knows that there is no-way the Army will let them fight and you can see how he genuinely cares for these men. He and Shaw find it hard to establish a different type of relationship with Thomas then they are used to as before they were friends.This is a very emotional film to watch. It has many highs and lows and you have these foreboding feelings in the pit of your stomach when Shaw volunteers his men for basically, a suicide mission to Fort Wagner. You know that these men you have watched from the beginning and have rooted for will die and it is hard to watch when it happens. The scene that particularly upsets me is when these brave, courageous soldiers are dead, they are just chucked into a mass grave and the most moving scene for me is when the dead bodies of Trip and Shaw are thrown together in the mass grave. That had me in tears the most.The 54th got praise for what they did at Fort Wagner and after but they were treated very badly, they were not invited to the parades to welcome the soldiers back at the end of the war and there was no help given to them to recover from it either. It does highlight that racism occurred in the military, not just in this war but in other wars before and after the American Civil War where people of different colour were treated as if they were not even human.Love the film but if you're a girl, you will need tissues by your side.",10,14,17,2 August 2007
The Killing Fields," Touching story of friendship between two men
","I wasn't born when the war in Cambodia was happening so I didn't know anything about it till I watched The Killing Fields.There is so many levels to this film. The main theme I think is the friendship between Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston), a journalist for The New York Times who is sent to cover the war between the country's revolutionary Khmer Rouge and Dith Pran (Dr Haing S. Ngor), his assistant who acts as an interpreter,guide and journalist/photographer. There are some very touching scenes between the two men, it is lovely to see two men who love one another, almost like brothers. The two actors Sam Waterston and Dr. Haing S. Ngor are just brilliant and had we in tears when they have to said goodbye to one another and Pran has to leave the embassy and they both know what happens to people like Pran. I especially loved the scene when they meet again and Pran runs into Sydney's arms and he tells Sydney that there is nothing to forgive.I like the fact that the film flips between the two characters. We see Sydney desperately trying to find Pran and Pran trying to survive the starvation and torture and he can never be himself, he must keep himself guarded because he knows they will kill him. One of the most gripping scenes is when Pran has escaped the camp and he comes across the most gruesome sight of skeletons littered all over the place. The film is not afraid to show graphic scenes of the violence that was going on at the time in Cambodia which is not sugarcoated but it shows the brutality that men can show towards each other.I feel the heart of the film is Pran. He suffered harsh treatment, starvation and torture from the Khmer Rouge and he doesn't seem to hate these people. He just accepts that he must follow their rules to survive so he can be with his family again.Just because the film is based on a real story, doesn't mean you have a happy feeling inside you, that you know that Pran beats them and survives and is reunited with his friend and family. There is still tension and you are gripped when you see what Pran goes through to survive.The music by Mike Oldfield is so appropriate and fits the mood of the environment. It is very well directed by Roland Joffe who keeps us to the edge of our seats up to the end.I think what also helps is the fact that the actor playing Pran, Dr Haing S. Ngor went through the same thing as Pran and who better to know what Pran went through, then this man who was tortured and had to deny being a doctor and couldn't save his wife in childbirth for fear they would both be killed. It is amazing that it was his first film role and he definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It is also sad that he survived Cambodia, only to be killed in a robbery. It was a waste and it should never have happened to this man who had been though enough already.",10,2,2,6 March 2007
Monsters vs. Aliens," Didn't bowl me over but was still entertaining
","I wasn't bowled over by the film but neither was I bored for the 94 minutes it was on. The time passed so quickly that I didn't feel the usual customary discomfit sitting in the cinema chairs that I usually get.The story was interesting and as other people have commented, harped back to the 50's Sci-fi films about monsters on the loose, terrorising the people on screen and in the audience. I thought it was really refreshing to have the monsters trying to safe the earth instead of destroying it, putting a different spin on it as in the past monsters are always seen as the bad guys.The film was very funny and I liked all the nods to other Science Fiction films like Close Encounters, The Blob, E.T and The Fly. The cast are brilliant and clearly are the right choices for the characters they play, Reese Witherspoon as Susan, Hugh Laurie as Doctor Cockroach, Will Arnett as the Missing Link but in particular the two that gripped my attention the most was Kiefer Sutherland as General Monger and Seth Rogen as the not-so-bright B.O.B.Is it worth going to see it at the Cinema or when it comes out on DVD?, yes it is because it was never boring and through the cast, script and visual effects kept me watching till the very end.",8,0,0,12 April 2009
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," My favourite so far
","I was sad when Richard Harris died as I wondered what would happen to the series. I was glad when they said they were not going to stop filming them and had cast Michael Gambon in the role. He does an admirable job but I found his slight Irish twang to be odd, I know he is trying to be different from Richard Harris but it is a little bit silly as it comes and goes.What appeals to me about this story is we see Harry in his teens, changing from the very first movie, where he stands up to his horrible family. I have to say I cheered when the aunt blew up and then flew away.I'm glad that Gary Oldman was in this film because I regard him as one of the best actors to ever come out of Britain.I like the fact that this story was not so much focused on Voldemort as the others, this was more about Harry finding out about who betrayed his parents to Voldemort and that he had a godfather if he ever wanted to get away from the Dursleys. It was also interesting to have one plot line which involved going back in time. The special effects for this was amazing as Harry and Hermione have to hide from their past selves. The other special effect I thought was amazing was Lupin turning into a werewolf and then the way the werewolf was animated.I had read the book but was still surprised, probably as it so long ago that I read the book. The scene, in particular when the audience find out that the one that betrayed Harry's parents and framed Sirius Black was Ron's rat who has featured in the other films. I laughed at the scene where Harry is invisible and is throwing snow balls at Malfoy and his friends.My favourite of the series so far.",10,0,1,15 May 2007
American History X," Dark yet compelling
","A former Neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton) comes out of prison, determined to put his past life behind him and be there for his family especially for his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who is following in his footsteps. His past life is told in black and white flashbacks throughout the movie so we get to see the type of person he was before he went into prison. What is ironic about the film is Derek got his brother interested in the neo-Nazi cause and it is up to him now to show his brother there is more to life then mindless hatred.There is a lot of complaints about the acting and the subject matter but I think those people ain't seeing what the film is trying to say.It is a very dark film that doesn't flinch away from the subject matter, the violence is hard to watch at times especially when Derek is raped by his fellow skinheads. What is disturbing most about the film is Derek and Danny are very clever but their minds are getting twisted by hatred that has no direction.I think the acting is not bad. Edward Norton is just mesmerising in the dual roles he has to play in this film. The first being a skinhead, you can see the madness from within him being translated to his eyes. Then as the changed man, his devastation when he see's his dead brother, has me in tears every time. Edward Furlong isn't bad either, although at times, he does come across as wooden. Stacy Keach plays a charismatic leader of the skinheads who twists their minds, even though he doesn't belief half the things he says to them and keeps his own agenda hidden from them so he can keep his control over them. He is also seen as a coward who is quite happy to incite all this hatred but not to take part in it. Avery Brooks who played Captain Sisko in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, plays a professor who sees past the brothers idiotic hatred and wants to turn their focus to something positive.If I have one negative thing to say, it is that I would have liked the film to show what happened to Edward Norton's character after his brother died, whether he went back to his old ways or continued on the more positive path and try to turn the skinheads away from the violence and hatred they embraced.This film just had me from start to finish.",8,0,1,17 June 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Not the best adaptation
","I was looking forward to watching this film, I just thought it would be a good movie but when I saw it, I was so disappointed in the film.I don't have the opinion of other reviewers that the reason it is not the best of adaptations is that it does not stay faithful to the book. When they say there was too much romance in the film, I don't agree. I don't think there was enough romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. I also didn't buy Keira Knightley as Elizabeth and Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Dancy. I just couldn't see them in the roles.Another problem I had with the film was it had the sense the action was speeded up so they could put all the relevant plot lines in but it just didn't work.Big disappointment.",3,3,12,7 May 2007
Singin' in the Rain," It will make you smile
","If you are depressed, this is the film to watch to get you out of that dark mood, it is the best feel good film I have ever watched. It has become my favourite musical film because Gene Kelly is a genius with the dance routines and they are a work of art all on their own.The film is about the era of silent movies where Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the most popular and successful silent movie stars. This all changes when talking pictures are introduced to the cinema goers and the film company has to keep up with the other studios by bringing out a talkie movie. In real life, this could be a kiss of death to any silent movie star whose voice didn't fit their image and who couldn't act in this new forum. This is true of Lina who has a very squeaky, high voice and Kathy Sheldon (Debbie Reynolds) is used as Lina's speaking and singing voice. Don falls in love with Kathy but Lina keeps getting in the way of their romance.It is unbelievable that Debbie Reynolds was just 19 when she filmed Singin in the Rain. She is just brilliant, I am annoyed to find out her voice was dubbed in some places as I think she has a beautiful voice and this should not have been done. She does make me laugh when she is acting out all the poses the silent movie stars make to Don who does that for his career.Donald O'Connor as Cosmo is the best. The energy and animation he shows in Make em Laugh has me in awe. I got tired just from watching him perform around the room.Whenever it is on, it does cheer me up and leaves a smile on my face for the rest of the day.",10,1,4,7 May 2007
Chariots of Fire," Pace a little slower then I am used to
","The Chariots of Fire theme by Vangelis is what impacted on me as it used to be on the radio all the time when I was a girl and I really loved the music. I never saw the film till now. I hadn't heard about Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams before watching this film.The story is a true story about two different athletics, (Eric Liddell) Ian Charleson who plays a Scottish missionary who runs because he believes God gave him the gift of running for a purpose and wants to please God. The other is (Harold Abrahams) played by Ben Cross, who wants to prove to everyone included the Cambridge society that he belongs and have them look at his personal achievements and not focus so much on him being a Jew.The story is told in flashbacks showing Liddell's and Abraham's journey from simple sprinters to competing in the Olympic games in 1924.It was very heavy going for me to watch as I feel it goes at a slow pace and only seems to get exciting and interesting when the races are happening. I was a little bored with the scenes in-between and found myself zoning out of the movie but when the racing scenes happened I was glued to them and found my heart beating that the men would succeed in their ambition to win a medal. I think it is a patriotic film and I couldn't help cheering for the British runners/athletics and booing the American runners especially the idiot American coach. Terry Rawlings did a superb job of editing the film and the cast did a good job, Nicholas Farrell, Nigel Havers, John Gielgud and Ian Holm who are the best actors Britain has to offer.The film won 4 Oscars, Best Costume Design, Best Picture, Original Score; Best Director and Best Writing for a screenplay.I didn't hate the film, I would say watch the film and decide for your self as it really depends if you like sporting films and particularly a gentler pace of story telling.",7,4,6,12 March 2007
Life Is Beautiful," Surprised at how much I enjoyed it!
","I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to this film as it was in subtitles and was about such a dark subject but I had heard good things about the film and decided to watch it and I have to say I don't regret it. It was my first subtitle film and once you get used to reading the subtitles on the screen, you soon forget that you are watching a subtitled film.The first part of the film was bright and breezy with beautiful scenes of Tuscany and Italy. It starts with Guido Orefice played by Roberto Benigni who in 1939, arrives in a large Tuscan village to work as a waiter at a local hotel. He meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) there and begins to court her. There are some very funny scenes which happen when he keeps meeting up with her, like her falling on him, him falling on her, then turning up at her school as the School Inspector, only for him to take his clothes off. I found the love story so touching and cheered when Dora finally decided to get rid of the jerk she was engaged to and choose Guido. The scene I most love is when she asks him to get her out of her engagement party and he comes on a green horse that has been vandalised by some unknown person and he rides the horse into the hotel and carries Dora away like a knight in shining armour.The film moves on to the last year of the war. Guido and Dora are married and have a son. Guido also has his bookshop he wanted when he first came to the town but their lives are changed forever when the Germans invade and send Guido and son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) to a concentration camp. Dora follows and demand that she is put on the same train as her husband and child.This starts the darker and gruesome side to the film. Guido pretends to his son that it is all a game and that they need to score 1,000 points to win a real tank but tells his son that he must keep hidden, not ask for food all the time or he will forfeit his points. There are some horrible scenes, one scene when Guido is bringing his son for a walk and sees the piles of bodies tossed as if they are rubbish and making sure his son can't see the horror before them. Another scene is when Dora and the other woman prisoners are sorting through piles of clothes that have been taken from people who were later gassed. There is a cat there and you flashback to the scene when Guido and his son are travelling to the concentration camp with a little girl stroking her cat and it is shocking that this innocent little girl is killed for something she can't change, and shouldn't have to.The scenes that tugged at my heart was Guido, somehow getting across the barrier between his wife and himself and telling her how much he loved her, the scene where he plays the music which has some significance for the both of them.What I wasn't prepared for but which I should have been was when Guido is killed at the end. That is truly a bombshell as you have been with him from the start and watched him survive all the horrors of the camp and keep his son from seeing the true reality that it is almost like your friend dying. I thought it was poignant when he is still keeping up the game with son and he is making a joke out of being lead away and he is still keeping up with the pretence even though he knows when he is being lead to his death.All the actors are brilliant, Nicoletta Braschi who plays his wife in real life, Giorgio Cantarini, Giustino Durano and Horst Bucholz. Robert Benigni definitely deserved the Oscar for his role and the film definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.",10,2,6,8 March 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Not as good as Pulp Fiction
","What appeals to me about Reservoir Dogs is it doesn't follow the conventional sequence of events that most Hollywood movies follows, this film is told out of order but it is still easy to follow the thread of the plot line.I enjoyed watching the scene at the start of the movie with the group, it was very funny with them interacting with one another and because of that I wanted more scenes with them but I realise it would have slowed down the story.Steve Buscemi's (Mr. Pink) performance stood out for me. He just makes me laugh with his tirade about not giving a tip to waitresses and he has some really good lines. Another stand out performance was Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde) who gives a very intense portrayal of a psychotic robber. He never plays it over the top or makes him look silly especially in the scene where he is dancing around just before he cuts a cop's ear off.Tarantino kept me interested because he doesn't show everything straight away, he gives little tidbits that kept me watching to see what happened next particularly in the robbery and how the robbery was set up and the type of people involved.Saying that, I just can't get into it like Pulp Fiction. To me, apart from the scene at the start and the scene where they are given the names and Steve Buscemi doesn't like his name and wants it changed, it is very heavy going for me and I found myself enjoying it less and less as time went on.",6,2,5,2 March 2008
Pulp Fiction," My guilty pleasure
","I prefer Pulp Fiction to Reservoir Dogs. I find it to be the funniest out of the two. There are so many funny situations that has me in stitches and it mainly involves Vincent and Jules. The scenes I laugh the most at is when Vincent shoots Marvin accidentally in the head, Jules and Vincent cleaning the car after and when Vincent brings an o-ding Mia to Lance's house, that just has me in stitches every time.I loved the interaction between Jules and Vincent. I couldn't wait for the film to switch back to them because they had really good chemistry, they were so hilarious together and I just enjoyed their reactions to the situations they found themselves in throughout the movie. I like that again Quentin Tarantino shoots the film out of sequence because it means that John Travolta who is shot in the middle of the movie, is alive at the end.There are other story lines entined in the film- Ringo and Yolanda robbing the coffee shop, Mia and Vincent's date, Butch (a boxer) who is paid to take a dive but ends up killing his opponent and trying to keep one step ahead of Vincent and Jule's boss Marsellus Wallace but as I have said I am more interested in the scenes that feature Vincent and Jules.I can see why this film was the comeback vehicle for John Travolta as he is just brilliant in it and it never seems like he doesn't belong in the role, what I also like about his role is he is not afraid to send himself up which we see especially in the dance scene with Uma Thurman. I can't imagine anyone else in Samuel L. Jackson's part, he just makes it his own. The other actors who I feel make the film entertaining is Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz.Yes, it has violence, some people class it as racist, I really don't know, maybe I'm wrong but I get the impression he is not doing it to be racist but is showing a world that not anyone sees or thinks still exists. It might be ugly but at least it is honest in saying our world is not as perfect as we think and the subjects covered in the film are happening somewhere. I have respect for Quentin Tarantino for not copping out and not trying to soften the hard core subjects the film features such as drug use and murder. A very good job, Quentin.",10,1,2,2 March 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Appeals to both children and adults
","What a wonderful world J.K. Rowling has set up in the Harry Potter series. I love the fact that the magical people inhabit the 'muggle' world and have to be careful that they keep their world hidden from non-magic people. I have never seen a film like this, especially on this scale.I was impressed with the special effects, particularly the first time Harry sees Diagon Alley. Other scenes that stand out is the great hall with the candles and pumpkins floating in the air and creatures such as the troll and three-headed dog.I like the fact that the film isn't overrun with American actors/actresses and that most of the cast is British as it just seems American films and actors have the monopoly over the world cinema so it is refreshing to have the British cast as you can hear a lot of different accents from Britain and I have fun trying to guess where the accent comes from.",10,1,3,16 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A lot more scarier
","I don't think the film is any darker than the others in the series. The overall story was dark to begin with, Harry's parents being killed by Voldemort and then Voldemort trying to kill Harry, who was a baby at the time. The film is a lot more scarier and I found myself jumping a lot in this film, unlike the other gentler movies.One of the key differences is that we see a popular student die at the end and we have watched him from the beginning and it is shocking the manner in which he is killed, very quickly and without any remorse. Another difference is the film ends on a cliffhanger, where Voldemort becomes powerful again and is now back to lead his followers. In the past films, there has been a resolution to the story and the audience has gone away happy but in this one, it is a very unhappy ending and we have to wait to the next one to see if Voldemort is defeated. Lucky for me, I have heard the books so I know there will be no happy conclusion for another few movies.I have to agree with one of the reviewers that the scene where Dumbledore grabs Harry violently is totally out of character for him, as up to this point, we have see him as a kindly old grandfather figure who has always been gentle with Harry. It just doesn't sit right with what the audience have seen in the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore in the past.The new character introduced in the film, Mad eye Moody played by Brendan Gleeson is brilliant, it was good casting and he works really well with how I pictured Mad eye Moody from reading the book.The film explores what its like for the younger characters in their teens. One is the awkwardness of fancing someone and having to ask them out and either being accepted or rejected. Harry has a crush on Cho Chang but is rejected by the girl of his dreams for the popular Diggory and has to settle for one of his classmates. Ron and Hermione's relationship develops from one of friendship to something a lot deeper. This film explores more about how they feel uncomfortable around one another because of their feelings but won't admit to each other how much they care. In the last two films, this was only hinted at. The other problem that plaques teens is appearance. Case in point, Ron wearing an old fashioned wizard cloak and feeling embarrassment that he is the only one to be dressed this way.There is also an appearance from the future Doctor Who David Tennant, he plays a nasty piece of work in this.I can't wait for the next film to see how it differs from the book.",9,0,1,15 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Just as good as the first film
","The special effects were awesome, the scenes I was particularly impressed with was the flying car, the phoenix bird going up into flames and then a little baby growing out of the ashes and the snake at the end of the movie.I hadn't read the books at this point which had me wishing I hadn't read the books after The Prisoner of Azkaban as in some way it spoiled my enjoyment of the film because I knew what would happen in the next films. At least with this film, it was unpredictable and kept me gripped as I didn't know about all the plot lines. I recommend people not to read the books and see all the movies first as it is fun not knowing what will happen in every part of the movie.More characters were introduced in the film. Dobby the House Elf, I found to be annoying at times. Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart was funny especially being in the worst job as a coward, a professor against the black arts. He likes to brag what a hero he is to anyone who will listen but hasn't done any of the things he's claimed he has. Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy, at his villainous best. Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, a wizard interested in the muggle world unlike his other wizard peers. Great casting as ever.What a plot! When I saw it, I was blown away by what an interesting plot twist J.K. Rowling introduced to the story, Voldemort has cast a spell to put his 16 year old self in his diary, waiting for a time to come out and attack students he considers 'mudbloods.' Wasn't disappointed in it, at all.",9,0,2,16 May 2007
The Queen," I remember where I was when I got the news
","I will always remember where I was when Princess Diana was killed in Paris. Coincidently I was in London for my 18th birthday. I remember making up in the morning after my birthday and finding out she had died in a car crash, I was in shock and disbelief that it had happened and this is one event I remember very well especially the nation being angry that the royal family had not done anything, lowing the flag, coming back to London and not making a statement at all, about Diana. This is what the ordinary British public expected and they showed the emotion they thought the Royal family were unable to but what the film picks up on is they come from a completely different world to us, they have privilege but they have this scrutiny that goes with it where everyone is watching and if they don't do or say the right thing they are picked apart. I didn't grow up in the Queen's time so I find that I don't understand the Queen as well as someone who grew up in the same era would and this is what the film goes to, the Queen was brought up in a totally different mind set then people in my era, they kept their emotions in check,never showing them to anyone. She must have felt a range of emotions but she had to be the Queen to the country first so she had to stiffen up and let the punches bounce off her.The film reconstructs the events of the week after Princess Diana was killed, it uses news footage from the BBC and ITV with the film's re constructions. It is unique as this is told from the royal family's perceptive. What I like about Stephen Frears direction is he shows the royal family sympathetically but he also shows the royals as they are and doesn't try to gloss over things that could show them in a negative way.I will never agree with some of the actions of the royal family but I think they are strong people who are human but they have their own way of dealing with situations that would have other people running for cover, especially The Queen and I admire them for that.The film is also about the relationship between the Queen and Tony Blair and the different approaches they have, Blair is modern and the Queen is seen as old fashioned.It is also ironic to see Tony Blair at the start of his term who was very popular and who understood and correctly Gage the mood of the public and now he is so unpopular and all he will be remembered for recently is his discussion to bring us into a war with Iraq. It is a shame that this should be one of the things he will be remembered for. I think there is a joke between the film and the audience when the Queen turns to Blair and says he will be in the same situation she found herself in with Princess Diana and the audience being in the present can see she is right as we are at the end of his term and most of the public have been turned off from Blair and the Labour government who we now see as being exactly like the Tories were when they were in government.The cast is wonderful. They are subtle performances, that are not caricatures of the real people, they are just understated and not over the top like some actors portraying real people have done in the past. Helen Mirren as The Queen, James Cromwell as Prince Philip, Michael Sheen, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles and Sylvia Syms as The Queen mother just convince you that you are seeing the real people they are portraying and not the actors.Special mention should be made to Peter Morgan for his writing, Film Editing by Lucia Zucchetti, Cinematography by Affonso Beato and Original Music by Alexandre Desplat.The only negative things I will say is the film shouldn't have killed that stag, I was very annoyed as I don't approve of hunting and didn't feel it had any reason to be in the plot. The other thing is where did the writer and director get their material, what research did they carry out and how do we know the royal family depicted in the film is how they were in reality.",7,0,1,27 April 2007
Tombstone," The best western that has been done in a while
","I am a real fan of the old westerns and have found the modern westerns lacking in what the old westerns stood for but in Tombstone, I have found the modern equivalent of the best old westerns that starred actors like John Wayne and Gregory Peck.Tombstone is about Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who moves to Tombstone to retire from the law and settle as a businessman in the town. He moves to the town with his brothers Virgil(Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton)to start a new life with them but through a series of run-ins with the cowboys, a murderous bunch of outlaws, realises he can't live the save life he wanted and has to step up to the plate and keep law and order in the town but after his brother is killed, he becomes focused on killing all the cowboys for what they have done and vows he will wipe out all the cowboys completely so they can't rise again to cause more mayhem to the area.This film has a lot of tension from the start when the brothers come across the cowboys and it builds and builds till you get to the point where your stomach is in knots because you are sucked into the movie and can't stop feeling jumpy when the two gangs clash. You are especially on tenterhooks when the Earps and Doc Holliday confront the gang at the O.K Corral and the director heaps more tension on as the two gangs freeze, waiting for the other to move first and you are on the edge of your seat waiting for the action to start again and when it does, it doesn't let up on the tension. It is quick and there is no hesitation as in the past, you had to be prepared to kill or be killed and you needed to be at the top of your game to survive. Even after the gun battle, there is still more suspense and apprehension about what will happen next and how it will finally end.This film is very much a morality tale. None of the bad guys survive not even Doc. The scene where Doc dies is not heroic, it is just unremarkable. He is in bed and knows from the feeling in his toes that it is time for him to leave the earth.What is touching is the relationship between Wyatt and Doc. They love one another like brothers and Wyatt is the only softness Doc has in his heart because he's had to survive living in the wild west and his life-threatening illness and to do so he had to be able to defend himself when the situation called for it. He is always there for Wyatt and what's sad is he is the only friend Doc has. Doc dies alone, not wanting his friend to see him in pain so he still protecting Wyatt.I also liked the rivalry between Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). They are equals, very intelligent men but also very deadly and they seem to understand where the other is coming from.I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Doc, Val Kilmer, makes that character his own. The accent, mannerisms and the whole essence of Doc has been skillfully crafted by Val. He does get all the best lines in the film and he delivers them with a tinkle in his eye.I like that the film ends on a happy note with Wyatt finally going to Josephine and just living for the moment like Doc told him to. It is not to mushy for the boys who watch the film and there is enough romance for the girls to enjoy.",10,0,0,7 May 2007
The Producers," crammed with memorable characters
","What a great plot, Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a down on his luck producer who hasn't had a hit play for ages and romances little old ladies to get cash for his plays. In walks Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) who is an accountant who has to go through Max's books. While doing this, he puts an idea into Max's head: a producer could make a lot of money by producing a flop and asking for a lot more money than he needs and when the play is a flop, he can keep the rest of the money. Max manages to talk Leo into joining him as his partner. They then set out to make a Broadway flop by getting the worse play, the worst director and the worst actor. They think they have succeeded when they find a play on Hitler.Wilder and Mostel are the best comedic double act and they work well together. Wilder has me in stitches at times especially the scene where he gets hysterical. I have to watch the scene more than once as it is one of my best scenes in the film.What annoys me about some critics is that they say the film is in bad taste but it isn't and they don't get what Mel Brooks is trying to do. Instead of praising Hitler, Mel mocks him especially having a hippie play him which would have probably made Hitler's blood boil if he had been alive to see it.The film is crammed with characters which I love. Kenneth Mars who plays Franz Liebkind. Mars is brilliant with the mad look he always seems to have throughout the film. Forever keeping his Nazi helmet on, never taking it off, no matter what he is wearing. Christopher Hewett who plays Roger De Bris and Andreas Voutsinas as Carmen Ghia, I can't imagine anyone else playing those characters, they make them their own. The character I really adore is Dick Shawn who plays Lorenzo St. Dubois. He is a hippie who it is decided will play Hitler. What a stroke of brilliance having his initials spell out L.S.D. The scenes where you have him shocked to see himself surrounded by Germans is humorous and when he says Baby, he just has me fits of laughter.Mel Brooks is a genius. He has the best cast that delivers his script with humour, he has come up with an original plot, his songs add to the humour. He is one my favourite directors who if any of his films are on, I have to watch them.What is interesting about the end is you don't want Leo and Max to be put away because you have gotten to like them by the end, mainly because of the friendship that they have formed while trying to pull off this big con.There is nothing bad I can say about the film except it might feel dated to some of the audience who were not around when it was made but you can still laugh at the humour.",10,1,3,6 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Not my favourite out of the trilogy
","I do find the plot hard to follow at times. I suppose what really matters is that the film is about good versus evil which most films have that theme running through them where two forces fight against one another and it is always good that triumphs as audiences prefer it that way so it is very much a moral tale.This film was totally different to the other Science Fiction films coming out at the time and before, the space scenes was grand scale and impressive, it didn't look tacky like the other films I had seen up to that point. It shows how hard George Lucas worked, to achieve special effects that in this day can be done with CGI but in the time the film came out, Lucas had to be very imaginative and be able to come up with new techniques to give the film the quality it has.I must admit, out of the trilogy, this is my least favourite. Don't ask me why but I just can't get into it like The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.I think the casting helps the film because the actors give a convincing performance and it is not easy with some of the dialogue they have to say.I like the fact Princess Leia is a feisty character who can pick up a gun and defend herself without needing to turn to a man to help her. It was also interesting to have a character like Han Solo who was cared more about what he could get out of the situation then how he could help people who needed him but at the end, we see there is a positive side to him because he comes to help Luke when he didn't have to. It was good to have such acting legends in the film, Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing. Vader is very sinister especially with James Earl Jones voicing him, he gives the character a menacing quality which wouldn't have worked without someone with a powerful voice to portray him.It is shocking when Guinness dies but it was a brilliant idea George Lucas had in keeping the character in the other films by bringing him back as a type of spirit.The music is amazing and just fits with the whole mood of the film.",7,0,0,10 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My favourite
","I love this film, I think it is mainly because of the sexual tension Leia and Han have which started in the first film and spilled over into this one. I love their relationship where they argue and you can see they care for one another but they won't tell the other and it is like a battle of wills between two strong people who won't admit they have deep feelings for one another. There are some tender scenes especially when Han is put into carbon freeze and Leia finally admits to Han that she loves him.In this film, Luke has developed from the first one, he has changed from the boy who was protected by his family and not allowed to help fight in the war with the empire. Now, he has had adventures and learnt about his powers and is starting to master them with the help of Yoda. I find it hard to understand Yoda at times because he adds a lot of 'am I' at the end of his sentences and can be very annoying.Lucas also allows the audience to see another side of Vader where we see that he is not all machine that he once was a person.This film is interesting because it ends on a cliffhanger and I didn't know that the reason for this was they didn't know if Harrison Ford was coming back as Han. I just thought Lucas had written it that way so we are left to wonder what will happen in the next one and if Harrison Ford will be back for the last film. The film also ends on a shocking note because Luke finds out that Vader is his father. In the first film, Obi-wan told him his father was destroyed by Vader and the audience is left to wonder what will happen in the next film, if Luke with have to kill his father.",10,0,0,10 May 2007
The Breakfast Club," Rebel without a cause for the 80's generation
","This movie is for the 80's generation of teenagers that were just as misunderstood as they were in the 50's and in today's society.The film is about teens with problems who are not understood by the adults or by their own peers and it shows how hard it is for kids to survive in that environment. 5 stereotypes come to school on Saturday for detention, not knowing one another and by the end, realising there is more to them then the labels people have give them. Emilio Estevez(Andrew) is a jock who beat up a kid and stuck his bum cheeks together to impress his father. We learn that his father doesn't like weakness and berates his son if he doesn't win and doesn't care how hard his son tries. Molly Ringwald is (claire), the princess who ditched class to go shopping. Her parents battle over her and she feels like she is being torn apart, that her parents don't really care about her and use her to win points against the other. Ally Sheedy is Allison a kook who lies and steals things. She hides herself behind a false persona and makeup so no-one can see the real her. Her family ignore her and the only thing better than staying at home on at Saturday was to come into school for detention to get away from her family. Judd Nelson (Bender) is a wise ass who is judged as a criminal and he is beaten up by his father. He is rude and shows no respect to the teachers. Anthony Michael Hall is Brian who is the brain. He feels like his family pressure him to get high grades and doesn't like himself as a person. He is troubled because his teacher found a gun in his locker. He thought about killing himself with it before the gun was found.John Hughes is good at showing teenagers in his films as not bad kids but kids that are just trying to survive teenage problems till they can leave school and their families. People who were teenagers can relate to that time when it felt like they wouldn't get through it and Hughes shows that there is more to people then labels and you have to talk to them to find out how they really tick as you never know who they are and can judge them too harshly.The actors work well together and I was brought to tears when they were talking about their experiences because I was thinking of my own teenage years.One of the scenes I absolutely love is when Allison is given a make over by Claire and the stare Andrew gives her when he sees her is so tender and he looks bowled over by her new look, like he is seeing her for the first time. I wish a cute guy like Emilio had done that in my teens.One of the best teen movies of the 80's.",7,3,6,7 May 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 10 across the board
","This is my favourite out of the trilogy.One of the reasons is River Phoenix who plays the young Indy. He was just amazing, you can tell he studied Harrison Ford as he has all of Ford's mannerisms and it is almost like you are looking in the mirror at the younger Indy. It is a shame that he died because he would have made a very good successor to the role of Indiana Jones.The other reason is introducing the Father/son relationship which was really well written and acted. The chemistry works really well between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. There are some very funny moments between them and it adds another layer to the story especially when there is confusion about which Dr Jones the evil guys are talking about.What is interesting about the start of the film is it shows the audience how Indy got his scar, where the influence came to dress the way he does and where his fear of snakes come from. We also find out why he is called Indiana which is funny when it turns out he named himself after the family dog.I like the fact that Elsa (Alison Doody) is working for the Nazis in this one because in the others Indy went off into the sunset with his heroine but she is working for the bad guys so she has to be punished for choosing the wrong side and does when she falls to her death and instead of riding off with his heroine, he rides off with his father and friends.The magic is still there and again the stunts just make the film what it is, an entertaining romp that never slows its pace and keeps the audience interested with its amazing stunts.It works on all levels and there was no part of it that I didn't like. It is just the best.It was nice seeing more of Marcus Brody (Denholm Eliott) in a different way, he is slow at getting out of danger and just walks into the enemies hands. The audience is also told he got lost in his own museum once which we didn't see any indication of in the first film, he came across as very knowledgeable and competent man.",10,2,5,23 May 2007
