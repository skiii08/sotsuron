Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie was for people that understood Star Wars
",I am so sick and tired of people giving this movie a bad rap.  Artisticaly it was incrediable.  No one has done what George Lucas did before.The plot line was excellent.  If you were a Star Wars freak not knowing what actually happens in the Star Wars Universe you would have been confused.Those people should not have watched this movie.  This movie put so many pieces together that I came out with a greater understanding of the characters of Episode 4:  ANH.To give this movie a horriable rating you should go back and watch it again. You will understand it more and you will begin to appreciate what ILM did in this movie.,10,0,0,5 November 1999
Brokeback Mountain," Was not impressed.
","I went against the advice of my fianc√© and other's around me. I didn't really like the idea of this movie. I just had to see a movie that was 'Good' enough to receive 8 Oscar nods.I was disappointed. I felt like I wasted money on a political movie that had no entertainment value what so ever.Numerous years ago I walked out of Interview with a Vampire asking for a refund. I came really close to walking out of this movie. People say that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal where brilliant. I found that both actors where on par when compared to their previous works which where not that great.There is not an ounce of quality to Brokeback Mountain. This movie is pure hype. Movies like this have come and gone and slowly fade away once the hype wears off. It might win an academy award if it does, it won't matter. It's a par movie that has massive political motives behind it.People get tired of movies like this. I hope the academy sees through the political hype. Good Night, and Good Luck is a far superior movie and is probably going to get passed over for this average movie.Stay away; it's not worth the hype.",1,23,92,22 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Refreshing return to the original franchise
","Crisp editing, perfect plot and great special effects lead up to a near perfect movie by Mr. Lucas.Staying awake at 2 a.m. was not a problem with the non stop action and well scripted romance scenes.  In other words, the plot was addictive.The greatest aspect of Episode II was the cinematography.  Genius was at work during the last light saber duel as Mr. Skywalker and Count Dooku twirled and slashed with their sabers in minimal lighting.  Just the contrast of the colors against the seemingly black backdrop was breath taking.The only draw back to this epic film was the inclusion of Jar-Jar Binks, the wayward Gungan.  His irritating presence ruined the 5 minutes of the film he was in.If you are into adventure and the SCI-FI genre (as always the Star Wars franchise) watch this movie.  Even the love scenes worked with the plot.Go see this movie...",10,0,0,16 May 2002
The Hills Have Eyes," Why I am not watching this movie.
","1- It is a remake. Modern remakes of classic horror stink.2- The advertising campaign is horrid. I have received 100 bulletin posts on myspace complaining about how every open space on myspace.com is filled with bad clips, sounds, confusingly worded text, and odd pictures that just make people mad.3- Did I say it was a remake? Go see something worth your time. Like maybe watch the grass grow? That might work. Or watch the original? THought about that? Stay away from remakes and maybe studios might realize that they need to find original material to scare us with.Sorry it is so brutal. It needs to be. Don't listen to those who give these movies 'rave' reviews. Most are writers for studios or those who do not see the art in a good fright flick. I am giving this the same rating as the one I gave to the original.",6,1,32,9 March 2006
