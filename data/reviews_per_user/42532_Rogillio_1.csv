Catch Me If You Can," Appeals to the larcenist in all of us!
","The story of Frank Abingnale is absolutely incredible.  I'm a movie-goer and not much of a book reader but I've read book 'Catch Me If You Can' three times over the years and was very surprised and pleased that the movie tracked the book fairly well.This is a movie for the whole family that does not resort to violence or vulgarity to prop up the story.  This movie is well written, well acted and well directed.  What more need I say?  A 'must see' movie!This gets my vote for 'Best Picture of the Year'!I can't wait to add this movie to my DVD collection!~mr",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
