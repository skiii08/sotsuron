Blade Runner 2049," It's not bad, just incredibly slow and boring...
","I don't understand the high ratings. I can honestly say this is among the most boring movies I've ever watched and the first time I actually fell asleep in the cinema.It's not that everything is bad, because it's not. Its just that everything is so slow and dull I couldn't care about the positives anymore.I mean the whole world look pretty amazing and definitely succeeds in displaying a dystopian future.The problem is that the dull colors just ads to the fact that for most of the film nothing interesting happens. It's 2 hours and 44 minutes that could have easily fit into half that time. The acting was good, but not good enough to keep me awake and the action scenes where almost all in the trailer.You wont miss anything worthwhile by not watching this movie.",4,1,2,24 October 2019
