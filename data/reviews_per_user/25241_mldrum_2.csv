The Blair Witch Project," The best non scary horror movie ever
","If you are watching this film to be scared, you will be disappointed. Nothing jumps out at you and it's really not scary.  But it is horrific. The whole movie aims toward the last 2 minutes, but you need to watch carefully to understand it.  I agree completely that this is not a movie to see with a bunch of rowdy people.  Watch it alone, and absorb the terror.",Null,0,1,2 October 2000
Sleepy Hollow," A very funny movie
","I was told that this movie was really gory, and not to watch it.  What gore???  Maybe I'm desensitized, but there were only a very few scenes that showed blood, and it was pretty fake looking.  I laughed all the way through.  Johnny Depp was PERFECT.  He made the most interesting facial expressions.  A very dark movie, but extremely funny!!",Null,0,0,23 October 2000
