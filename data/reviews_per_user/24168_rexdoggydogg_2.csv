The Avengers," one of the best move I'v seen!!
","this movie is the best. I did not expect it to be good. WARNING this will have spoilers if you haven't seen this STOP READING. Loki is back and Nick fury is calling the Avengers. Thor,Hulk,Captain America, Hawkeye,Iron Man,and Black Widow. Iron Man was funny. Robert Downey Jr is the best Iron Man. Also The Hulk is funny. one part hulk punches Thor. If you haven't seen the after credits of Thor And you don't understand why Lokis back, Go watch the after credits for Thor and it will explain. During the credits Their is a villain that leaves for a sequel. Also after the credits its the best seen it show them eating. Now Im finished I give this a perfect 10!!!!",8,36,70,3 July 2012

Darth Maul was a really good villain 3. I really liked the special effects in this movie. 4. The Pod Racing is really cool 5. The final battle was awesome Now i will tell the bad1. Jar Jar is by far the worst Star Wars character. 2. While I thought the voice of Yoda was good, The design is kind of creepy. 3. The story is okay. But, its not the best. 4. Not a lot of Darth MaulAll and all, I thought it was still of good film. It has it's problems but, I enjoyed it. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,4,6,14 May 2013
