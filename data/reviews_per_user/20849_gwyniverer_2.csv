Hereditary," Disturbing
",The trailer for this movie had amazing scenes & I found myself excited to watch it. Unfortunately the only half good scenes were the ones that were in the previews. The storyline made little to no sense and was hard to follow. By the end it didn't even feel like I was watching the same movie. The amount of twists and side plots made the entire film difficult to digest and a shame to watch. I don't recommend this awkwardly filmed and directed movie to anyone that wishes not to waste 127 minutes of their life.,2,1,3,10 June 2020
Midsommar," Horrible
","This movie reminds me of a sick sister film to Hereditary. The directing feels awkward and slow. The storyline doesn't make sense until almost the end, then you continue to feel confused but not in a good way. The climax is nonexistent. I could skip the first hour and a half and miss essentially nothing. Good story. Horrible movie. I blame the director.",2,6,8,24 May 2020
