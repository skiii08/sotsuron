Vertigo," Rock Hudson Original Scottie
","Yes, it truly would have been an original choice to cast Rock Hudson as Scottie Ferguson. He would have been right for the role in every way: looks, temperament, acting ability. He had already shown a successful romantic side in his Sirk soaps. And he had the brawn and all-American good looks to be believable as a retired San Francisco detective. At 32, he would have been more than believable as the love interest of Kim Novak, then 24. At any age he was a more sensitive actor with a greater range and sensibility than Stewart. Finally, among Hollywood producers, he would have been a plausible choice for the more than decent box office performance of his films. As it is, James Stewart, a non-actor, ruined the film because of his advanced age and for the dreary character he chose to create. He does not succeed in portraying a man poetically obsessed by a feminine ideal. When I first saw this movie I thought it was Kim Novak who stood in the way of Vertigo's becoming a masterpiece. But she actually does an acceptable job of embodying both the classy Madeleine and the baser Judy. Later I found out that even Hitchcock did not object to Novak's replacing Vera Miles, his original Madeleine; and when he had the chance to re-sign Miles after her pregnancy, he stayed with Novak. The only big mistake as far as Novak is concerned is the inclusion of the letter writing scene in which Judy Barton confesses her crime to Scottie and the audience. Hitchcock tried to have the scene deleted as he knew its absence would have made the movie more ambiguous and intriguing until the final half hour. It would have been more exciting to discover Judy's crime along with Scottie as he recognized the necklace from Carlotta's portrait. What's so wrong about Stewart? He was just under 50 in 1957, but he seems more like 70. He's doing his usual hapless bull in a China shop, where someone of greater finesse is called for. The naive persona which was charming in a movie like The Shop Around the Corner had been exaggerated by the time of It's a Wonderful Life and later films into a doddering caricature of Elmer Fudd. It's a bore and never appropriate for a romantic lead. The final scene would have played a thousand times better with Scottie seducing her to the top of the tower, instead of manhandling her as the screenplay called for. The sudden violence is out of character for Scottie, nor does it square with his romantic obsession to turn a woman—even as vulgar as Judy—into his ideal. The way the movie plays now, it's as if Stewart drags her to the belfry to throw her off. Had she gone willingly, then fallen out of her own guilt and fear, it would have seemed to be poetic justice instead of vendetta. Obviously the screenplay was partly to blame. But a lot of that incorrect emotion created by the ending has to do with Stewart's poor acting.",8,1,5,4 December 2011
Black Swan," Does This Tutu Make My Ass Look Fat?
","As an idea, Black Swan is quite interesting. As a film it is a huge disappointment, even failing to make it as a camp classic. Here is what should have happened: brilliant director meets creative writer, choreographer and actress to illustrate how dance can evolve into something thrilling, as characters paradoxically find and lose themselves simultaneously. Unfortunately those talents were not available, but, rather four sows' ears, who, falling well short of silk, delivered an embarrassing, lumpen mess. We will not even go into the movies that get it right, as this after-school effort is not worthy of that association. The sensibility of the director is the antithesis of what was required. Why he would have taken on a project so far beyond his capabilities is a puzzlement. The hubris is as risible as that of Jack Buchanan's character, the great Cordova, in the movie the Band Wagon. (Cordova hilariously tries to turn a simple-minded vehicle for fun-loving Broadway hoofers into Faust.) Unlike the creators of the Band Wagon, the director of Black Swan was dead serious, though unfortunately out of his depth. In like manner, his lead actress could not pull it off, armed with only two expressions in her thespian arsenal: the placid vacuity of someone selling beauty products at Saks and something more complex, part smile, part horrified sneer (with a touch of flared nostril) as if she just caught a glimpse of her own, pre-rhinoplasty face. These have gotten her through many a film, including Thor. The surgery certainly gave her voice an annoyingly nasal timbre, if not the honk of a swan, nor the ability to take flight in the role. Moreover, six months of working out were apparently not enough to give her the grace and energy required to embody her character. Prominent neck tendons aside, she is simply too dumpy to be a convincing Nina. If you disagree, have a look at pictures of this season's ABT lineup. The writer had no previous credits of distinction and it shows. The choreographer was a French provincial import with no ambition to outdo Reisinger or Petipa, from what we know of their work. And that is truly the biggest disappointment of all—the movie does not portray the genius and excitement of dance. In fact, the only enjoyable moments of Black Swan are scenes featuring the wonderful Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey, prompting one to think that there might be a much more interesting story to tell about a stage mother and her alcoholic, has-been daughter.",Null,0,0,18 September 2011
Public Enemies," Tommy Guns? They're Just Big Flamers!
","It's a pity these three great actors were squandered on such an inferior script and so undervalued by this B- director. Apart from the fabulous sound design and the blazing tommy guns—which shoot flames in 2 directions—the film is an overproduced and under-directed snooze. Remember the prissy and purple script for Untouchables? This one is not that precious, but the performances are. It is not the fault of the actors, who have only trite or dim dialog to work with. I think they knew it was bad as they filmed it. You almost sense them looking at their reflections in the camera and making corrections to exquisite effect. Why not? Might as well be part of an artifact that looks great if it's not going to break new ground. The make-up enhances the preciosity. Everyone looks ridiculously pancaked. Producers take note: never let the make- up distract from the drama, especially one that's already so unconvincing. I had expected a thrilling script that might lay bare the world of these dazzling '30s sociopaths, born with extra Y chromosomes. Instead, I got a parade of implausibly clad Ralph Lauren mamma's boys.",4,4,10,4 July 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sondheim's usual knish: overrated, leaden and tasteless
","No, despite Sondheim's ambition, this offering of empty calories will never make it to a gourmet menu. A humble barber loses his pretty partner and daughter. He seeks revenge on the world with a low-life malheureuse. The serial killing and cannibalism that follow seem emotionally out of place. You never feel Todd's motivation is authentic. His suffering is not really on the level of Job, Spartacus, Karl Childers or even the Count of Monte Cristo. Unfortunately, like all of Sondheim, the emotional context here is about as authentic as one of the whinier episodes of Love American Style. The music is derivative and not really good, though the creator no doubt considered it to be ground-breaking. Rejected by his mom, Sondheim went after big-time approval from critics and audiences. The Former he usually gets from the parochial Miss Daisys of the New York Times. But the theaters staging his works usually end up empty. No one considers Sondheim a legend as much as Sondheim. When Follies was revived last year on Broadway, I overheard a priceless sales pitch on the half-price tickets line. The officious hawker was trying to convince a tourist to see it with the following guarded praise: 'It's really great, well anyway it's like a museum piece...well, in any case, the performances are certainly worth seeing.' And I said 'save your money and look for a real museum piece in a museum. You're too late for the real Follies, which at least had spectacle in their favor.' Sweeney avoids the endless kvetch-fest of Follies, but not a note of it rings true. Just one example to illustrate how emotion is just wallpaper to Sondheim: how on earth does Mrs. Lovett end up singing 'Not While I'm Around'? Schizophrenia? For it is the only thing of its kind in the whole show, so you can't believe it. Bizarre. That being said, the acting here is fine, even Sacha Cohen as the macassared mountebank . Too bad the actors had such mediocre material to work with. An interesting Sondheim anecdote: I was at the Met for a brilliant performance of an opera about another ne'er-do-well. I can't besmirch the composer by stating his name in the context of this debacle. Suffice it to say, the character he created, unlike Sondheim's, is richly ambiguous, not a stereotype, with interesting motivation and ingenious music. Sondheim was in the first row and at the curtain got up and scurried out without applauding in the midst of tumultuous appluse. Jealous much? My advice: write a musical about a Broadway songsmith with towering ambition and puny talent. That's a story I'd believe and I think this time he'd get it right.",1,2,6,12 May 2013
Gone with the Wind," A foul wind...please recast Ashley!
","The production values are spectacular and many of the performances are excellent, but the central theme of a romantic triangle ultimately fails to convince. It isn't that Leslie Howard was a bad actor. He was a great Henry Higgins. He was simply not the right casting choice for Ashley Wilkes. Yes, he played Ashley as a moralizing weakling, which is how Mitchell wrote the character. But he could not create the charisma one needed to sympathize with Scarlet's feelings of loss. Had Howard been cast opposite someone like Miriam Hopkins as Scarlet O'Hara, he would have held his own well enough. But throughout the 3 plus hours of the movie as produced with Vivien Leigh in the title role, one is too mystified as to why someone so glamorous and sexual as Scarlet cares about this flat-liner. One can't even buy it with the explanation that she only wants what she can't have or she only wants someone who rejects her. It's not just because Howard comes across as a colossal closet case, who married Melanie only because no one would expect sexual ardor of him with such a woman. It's just that Vivian Leigh's Scarlet is so aware of her worth and radiance, one can't imagine her being enthralled by anyone so inferior as Ashley, someone who doesn't even stand up well in comparison to her other long-shot suitors, let alone to Rhett. This fatal casting flaw makes the movie a magnificent misfire. In a few years, with the advance of computer imaging technology and convincing vocal duplication, Gone With The Wind can at last be redone with the existing footage enhanced by a better casting choice for Ashley spliced in. There are two ideal actors from the period. Both are blonds and exceptionally virile, offering a much more convincing counterbalance to the machismo of Clark Gable. The first is Errol Flynn, who, had he been cast, would have played wimpy against type and beat Gable and Robert Donat that year for the Oscar. The Academy loves the fabulous playing unfabulous. The second choice would be Brian Aherne, like Flynn also breathtakingly handsome and able to play the character as written by Mitchell. Both casting choices would have made the viewer understand Scarlet's misguided attraction. You would totally comprehend how it is possible to look at such a man and imagine something that is not there in a way that simply is not possible with Leslie Howard in the role.",7,1,5,9 April 2009
Lincoln," Well, not so much Lincoln as Elliot Spitzer
","I thought I was watching a Mad TV sketch, replete with pompous dialog, howlingly bad wigs and imprecise accents, condescending racial stereotypes. But no, it was actually something that its producers hoped to be a contender for big awards. But what else would one expect from this pretentious director, the over-hyped doyenne of all-American Spam? Despite his many titles, one can identify only a few minutes of emotional authenticity in his oeuvre. They come in the early scenes of Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and Super 8. The rest is banal, trite and frankly phony. Sally Field usually elevates whatever role she takes on with her extraordinary talent. She is at sea here with this flatfooted material. The limited acting skills of D D. Lewis results in an unsure impersonation of Walter Brennan's voice as Grandpa McCoy, but a spot-on reflection of Elliot Spitzer's demonic aspect. Now there was an American politician whose fiendish visage did not hide a heart of gold. Lewis gives the impression of a man who does good deeds while hiding a preference to do ill. It was the opposite with the historic Lincoln, whose spooky Marfan syndrome could not dim a beautiful soul. If you want to connect with this wonderful President's spirit as communicated by a real actor, spend a few moments with Benjamin Walker's genius turn in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer. Played railroad straight, despite the ridiculous graphic novel source material, you get a better idea of what Lincoln was all about than you will from this pedestrian Flag Day float.",5,21,63,9 November 2012
Les Misérables," Miserere nobis! Save this artifact with selective dubbing.
","Apart from the portrayal of Javert, there's nothing essentially wrong with the acting here. Of course, it's easy to fault Crowe's conception, when one has the genius performance of Charles Laughton as Javert to compare it with. In that much earlier film one ends up caring more about Javert's tragedy than about Valjean's thwarted love story. That being said, you can save this very expensive new edition by dubbing the roles of Fantine, Javert and Valjean with real singers. Consider it very post, post production. For Fantine, get someone like Christine Andreas. Tap Norm Lewis for Javert, and Jonas Kaufmann for Valjean. The third stand-in is an A-list opera tenor, which one apparently needs to get the role's long recitatives executed with conviction and musicality. In fact, some of his music was borrowed from a real opera. The show is through composed, so every line is set to music. If one is not musical, that can be disastrous. The three actors cast here could not handle this style of sung dialog and most of their work is painful to the ear. That seems odd. It's not as if this were Janacek's From the House of the Dead or something vocally challenging, but apparently beyond the efforts of these leads. As for the music itself, it is not that extraordinary, except for Valjean's big number, Bring Him Home, which everyone knows was stolen from the Humming Chorus of Puccini's Madama Butterfly. However, this film is worth saving, as the art direction and cinematography are fine and all the other characters sing beautifully, even Amanda Seyfried. Barks' Eponine gives a vocal performance that will give you chills.",6,1,3,13 January 2013
The Reader," No Easy Answers
","The Reader is the best kind of movie, because it engages the mind with puzzling and yet interesting ambiguity. Daldry, the director and Schlink, the author, leave their intentions not so much transparent, as invisible. That is refreshing, when the story involves places and events which usually are presented to illicit one reaction from an audience. That's not the case here; and you may find yourself thinking about the film for weeks after seeing it. Essentially the movie is about forgiveness of others and of ourselves. In this scenario, everyone is revealed to have something to feel guilty about. But because the filmmaker and author present so many facets of the story, no heroes or villains emerge. Is Winslet's character guilty or the worst kind of victim? What kind of background did she have that left her unable to read and a slave to authority? It's a tribute to Winslet that we care so much about her character's back story. Fiennes' character could be equally indictable on his failure to divulge key evidence in the trial, despite his being an aspiring lawyer. Even Lena Olin's saintly writer is not shown to be without taint in a scene that shows her smugly living on her profits from the stories of the murdered. The blurring of right and wrong is what makes this movie so much better than typical Oscar contenders.",9,1,2,16 February 2009
Prometheus," Greatest Science Fiction Film of All Time, and Even Before
","What most creative teams in the business forget is that engaging science fiction requires wonder, not preaching or tidy answers. This film provides a rich tapestry of ideas, ambiguity and visceral thrills that probably should be left as a stand-alone, as it does not seem likely that anyone in Hollywood would have the creative chops to produce a satisfying sequel. This movie is less a prequel to Alien, than a brilliant sequel to Angels and Insects. Appropriating the ideas of Darwin, spiked with a Wagnerian grandeur and the narrative genius of the Odyssey, Prometheus makes all the Alien movies, from best to worst, seem to be trivial sidebars. It does this in a most ingenious way. The particulars of the Alien movies, which were at best tales of infestation, are given magnificent cosmological scope here, where everyone and everything might turn out to be be the result of a monstrous lab experiment. Like our own race which strives for eternal youth and perfection (whether for ourselves or our android charges), the other-worldly Engineers have been at genetic improvements for so long that, by the time they head for Earth, 2,000 years ago, with an unknown sinister purpose, they themselves bear a striking resemblance to the idealized sculptures of Herakles found in Flavian bathhouses. Is that really a look that happens in nature? Two mysterious iconostases are found in the chapel aboard the spaceship of the Engineers, one an idealized godlike human head, the other a precious high relief of the Xenomorph, whose first cousin went on to wreak havoc in the Alien series. Which of these is the deity is not clear. So lots of fun unanswered questions remain. Did the Engineers develop this silicon and hydro-sulfuric acid survival machine as their ideal of nature? Or was it a misstep during millenia of unchecked eugenics? The writers are careful to include the story of humble earthworms that get jacked up on the black DNA goo to become indomitable phallic cobras. No, the canisters do not contain just one result. A vodka cocktail with dingy DNA makes an archaeologist transmogrify after begetting his own octopus that has a nasty resourcefulness similar to the creature in Alien. Some of the casting is bad, as are many of the performances. Most of the scientific staff could have used a few lines in the patois of their fach to be taken seriously. The oil-rig worker mentality and bavardage of Alien is wrong for this crew of elites. The male archaeologist, Charlie Holloway, is someone you wouldn't expect to pass a driving test, let alone earn a Ph.D. And Charlize Theron's wonderful talents are wasted on a character who is unnecessary here. Maybe she is more pivotal if she is scheduled to be resurrected in later installments. The movie is amazing because all these shortcomings don't matter. The big ideas are wonderfully actor and writer proof. The action is spectacular, including one of the most dramatic collisions in cinema history, registering as powerfully as Donner's hammer in Das Rheingold. I hope there are three more Prometheus movies planned, as there are three more operas in the Ring. But if they are not as good as this one, we are better off without them.The production values are high: art direction, cinematography, special effects. The photography is heroic and breathtaking. The part of the soundtrack that has a memorable hook was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. That for the creature is a reprise of what Jerry Goldsmith wrote for Alien. The tantalizing questions posed by the film might lead to greatness. David, the android with coconut milk blood and a fetish for blond movie stars, is an analog for the Xenomorph. Does he feel hurt at the indifference of his human creators. Is his status as a sub-human and the pain that causes him meant to echo our relationship to the Engineers, who appear to have been responsible for our genesis?The fountain of youth enriches this story of eugenics. Are the canisters of DNA key to Weyland's regeneration? If he is about 100, how is it that his daughter, Theron's character, looks only 30? Again, the curious moral implications of this angle make the story so much more interesting than a mere alien invasion.What was the motive of the Maverick Engineer at the beginning of the film. Did he populate the earth with his DNA to evolve a species capable of saving his own race from the seemingly indestructible Xenomorphs?Did the Engineers evolve the creature as a biological planet cleanser, a deity or a flawless survival machine?If the answers to these questions can be handled intelligently, we look forward to more in the saga.",10,6,16,5 August 2012
Rear Window," Had Richard Egan replaced Jimmy Stewart
","This film has a great story, setting and Edith Head costumes, but the romantic underpinnings are impossible to believe. Is it too much to ask for a convincing romantic coupling in an A-list murder mystery? Richard Egan was appreciably more masculine and charismatic than Jimmy Stewart; and his career was sufficiently established for his casting not to represent a major risk. He also had a superb physique (see Demetrios and the Gladiators), which would have been the believable result of his adventurous occupation. His physical condition would have made it OK for him to appear shirtless or in underwear, attire apposite both to his broken leg and dangerous lifestyle. He never would have had to sport the ridiculous, grandmotherly pajamas Stewart does to hide his premature senescence. In fact, during the massage scene, one is actually more attracted to Thelma Ritter's personality and energy. Though Stewart's character condescends to Ritter as a much older woman, she is actually only 6 years his senior. Egan was a rugged, deep-voiced Californian who exuded a paradoxically gentlemanly refinement. He was an alpha male with the luster of a graduate Stanford education. At the time Rear Window was made, he actually had a lot of work and was probably not available. That is a pity, because his presence would have made it an artifact one would have liked to return to again and again. In 1954 he was busy holding his own against Tyrone Power, the pretty boy in Untamed who wins Susan Hayward's love. In that bodice ripper, Egan is made to seem too brutal and crude a match for the social climbing Katie (her GWTW consolation role). But that's what would have made him so right for Rear Window. At a glance, you believe he would seek the thrill of photographing mountain climbers in Nepal, race car drivers, Texan rodeos or tangle with Raymond Burr, but also have the physical magnetism and refinement to attract someone like Lisa Fremont. Yes, it seems many young women at the time were OK with men 21 years their senior (though most frequently in the minds of Hollywood producers). But even Grace Kelly, so frequently cast with granddaddies, found a real prince only 6 years olderâ€”a coup de grace. The casting of Stewart enervates the sexual excitement of Lisa's sleepover, rendering her lightly-packed Mark Cross bag powerless to titillate. If she were going to throw away her privileged existence in a very nice building at Park and 63rd by slumming with a photographer in the Village, it would hardly be with the glum actuary played by Stewart. With him one feels certain her honor is completely safe, in or out of the Edith Head negligee. That would not have been the case with Egan playing Jeff; and the movie would have survived with a more appealing adult sensibility.",8,0,1,23 January 2012
