Alien 3," A decent film, but not nearly as good as 1 or 2
","This movie was OK. It was still kind of scary and Sigourney Weaver did a good job of reprising her role again. The premise was a little shaky. I mean, how did that egg get there? But still, it makes for a decent movie. Fans of the first two will be slightly let down, but overall it was a decent movie.I did miss the 'aliens exploding everywhere' of the second movie. Still, one alien in an unarmed prison complex does make for a nice movie.If you are a fan of the Alien movies, I would stop here. Don't bother seeing number four. Although despite warnings like this one, I still did.",7,3,24,30 December 2007
Alien: Resurrection," Bad, bad, bad.
","This movie shouldn't have been made. It lacks all the outright fear of the first three. Sigourney Weaver did a decent job, but the movie itself was just too corny to be a valid representation of the Alien Series. Honestly, if you are a true fan of the series, I would advise skipping this one.To be honest, the book that either this movie is based on or is based on the movie (I am not sure which) had a much cooler storyline. I mean Ripley gets into a bare hands fight with an alien and wins. That would have been an awesome element to add to the movie.Winona Ryder is moderately good at acting, but she doesn't really stand out in any good way.And the storyline is very hard to believe, although they did take blood from Ripley in 3, so I guess the alien could be cloned, but I don't recall the Alien embryo altering the host's blood chemistry and DNA in any of the other movies, so all they should have is Ripley's blood.Anyway, it works, and the film does give you a little bang for your buck. If possible avoid, but any alien fan needs to see this movie once, so they can appreciate the others even more.",5,1,2,30 December 2007
Alien," A great movie for the era
","I will just come out and say it, this film ROCKED! By today's standards, one might call the effects a bit cheesy, but for the time, this was impressive. Taken from that point of view, this film was awesome. Sigourney Weaver does a good job portraying a warrior woman, and the rest of her crew does a good job. I would have liked more of a tour of the alien spaceship, but the scenes we saw were quite impressive.Still, it is a sci-fi horror flick. People dying in a spaceship, valiantly trying to save themselves. Of course they come up with a plan, but the Alien is just too clever.Overall a good movie to see. I was very impressed with it.",9,0,1,30 December 2007
Predator," An excellent movie
","Being as this is the first time you ever get to see predators, this movie rocks. Despite I think Arnold doesn't have a very large emotional range (I have often compared him to the rock), he fits right in in this movie. I would compare him to Stalone and Rambo. He does a good job. Sonny Landham was just amazing, I loved him.*Spoilers beyond this point* Arnold does a good job in fighting the predator and overall this movie is just GREAT!. It creates a great atmosphere, trapped in the jungle being hunted by an enemy that you cannot see. People dying left and right. God, this kept me at the edge of my seat the first time I saw it. Having seen it several times since then, I still like it, although it has lost some of its charm as all movies do when you see them several times.",9,1,2,30 December 2007
Aliens," The best movie in the Alien series thus far
","This film, was EXCELLENT. If you have seen Alien3 or Alien 4 (Resurrection), and didn't like them, you have to see this one. By far the best one in the series. I have watched this film over and over again and I never get tired of it. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role and she downright kicks butt.*Spoilers below* Personally, I wouldn't want to go back to LP-426 and face those creatures again, but that would make for a dull movie with a mere cameo of Sigourney Weaver just for plot. She does an excellent job. The one thing I would change if I could would be to only off some of the lesser known marines when they battle in the hive, saving all the ones you know by name until later. But it is effective, you get attached to some of them, and watch them all die in an instant.Now why the aliens would choose the atmosphere processor for the hive I have no idea. Since it was automated, there should be very few people there. I would think they would create the nest in a basement of the living complex somewhere.And, when an alien kills the pilot of the first drop ship, why on earth did they set down on the surface. Especially with the ramp open! They should have dropped the APC and went back to the Sulaco. Still, a good movie, I HIGHLY recommend it.",10,1,2,30 December 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Not the worst movie ever but....
","I would have really liked them to do more with this movie. Sure it sets itself up for a good storyline, but honestly, it needed more. It felt more like Indiana Jones (with all temple and it's traps), combined with a Military movie.What is even worse, is that they seemed to have taken elements from the Predator and Alien books, and put those plot elements into this movie. Pick up a copy of Aliens vs Predator: Prey and tell me the final battle scene with the queen isn't right out of the ending of that book.My biggest beef with this movie was that it was rated PG-13. While I don't think an R rating would have made this movie much better, it doesn't fit with the rest of the movies being all R rated. At least give us the blood and gore if you won't give us plot or character development.A good movie to see once, but don't think this is what the Alien or Predator movies are like.",6,1,2,30 December 2007
Dodgeball," Not the best movie I've ever seen but...
","This film was decent. It has an amazing number of cameos, and a decent storyline as well as an uplifting ending. Vince Vaughn could have been better, but overall he does a good job of being a leader. Ben Stiller was a bit over the top, but it works. He's not really believable, but it is a movie after all.*Spoilers after* Still, the main focus of this film seems to be cameos. A list of most of them: * Lance Armstrong * Chuck Norris * William Shatner * David HasselhoffJust having all these people in this film brings it up a bit.Overall, this film was good.",7,1,2,1 January 2008
