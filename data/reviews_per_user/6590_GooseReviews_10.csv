The King's Speech," Warm and funny
","The movie directed by Tom Hooper, based on true story of King George VI of the United Kingdom and his lifelong struggle to overcome his speech impediment. His wife hires an Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue in order to help him. The movie tells us a story about friendship between the King and Lionel and historical events of that time. It was really pleasant to see it. Colin Firth was amazing as King George - you can really see how great actor he is. Really worth see it.",9,0,0,20 March 2017
Coraline," Animation!
",The movie directed by Henry Selick and based on the book by Neil Gaiman. It's a story of a girl who moved to new home. We can see that her parents are busy and don't have a time for her. One night Coraline finds magic door that leads her to the parallel world where her Other Parents create a perfect home. Soon Coraline discovers that the magic world is a trap. I must admit that the animation is amazing. Every character looked awesome and had so much detail to them. I am wondering how can I describe the movie and horror for kids come in mind. It was nice to watch.,6,1,1,20 March 2017

Gone with the Wind," Tomorrow is another day :)
","A movie based on the book with the same title. It tells a story of beauty from Georgia during the Civil War and just after it. Scarlet O'Hara loves her family and her home - Tara, and she'll do whatever it takes to protect them. When something goes wrong she does not give up and deal with everything. The movie is impressive. Beautiful scenes, great acting performance by Vivian Leigh and Cark Gable, great music. I cannot think about anything negative in this movie. It's really worth watching.",Null,4,6,24 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Good music and good laugh ;)
","The movie directed by James Gunn, a part of Marvel Cinematic Universe. A group of dysfunctional criminals is forced to work together to save the universe. As main characters, we can see Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper). It's a great movie. In my opinion the best from Marvel Cinematic Universe so far. A lot of humor and action. Also the great music and jokes, that make you laugh at loud. All that sum up and makes this movie so special and so good. Really good job, Mr. James Gunn! ;) I can without any doubt recommend this movie ;)",10,2,4,24 May 2017
Logan," circle of life
","A movie, directed by James Mangold, tells us a story of Wolverine and Professor X who take care of young mutant with similar abilities to Logan's. You can see that both Wolverine and Professor X struggle with their health and they are not so young anymore. Both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart did an outstanding job. Also Dafne Keen as Laura was amazing. There were couple of things at the end of the movie that was not necessary and in my opinion ruined it a little bit. But all in all, it was really good movie.",7,3,9,24 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Yandu!
","A movie directed by James Gunn. Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell, Vin Disel (voice of Baby Groot), Bradley Cooper (voice of Rocket) and  Sylvester Stallone. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) meets his father for the first time and family reunion goes wrong. Writing more on the story would be a major spoiler. The story itself is not as good as it was in first part of Guardians of the Galaxy. However, I really liked it. The best character in the movie is without any doubt Yandu. You can find a lot of humor and great directing in this movie. The scenes are amazing. And again  great selection of music. I was really enjoying it.",9,2,6,24 May 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Disappointment
","A movie directed by Chad Stahelski. The main character (Keanu Reeves) returns to the killing business and kills a lot of people. I must admit that I was expecting a lot from this movie since the first part was genius. And.. I was really disappointed. In the first movie you can see how opponents of John Wick are afraid of him, he is the Legend. And in this part, you can't feel it. It's like another action movie where is a lot of fights, but there is a complete lack of atmosphere from 1st part.",4,33,73,24 May 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Short and to the point
","The movie directed by Mel Gibson. The true story of Desmond Doss, the conscientious objector who joined the army during II World War and refused to carry the gun. The movie shows his struggle with the army and then a stunning history of his bravery on the battlefield. Amazing story and great directing by Mel Gibson make this movie really worth seeing. 9/10",9,7,11,20 March 2017
Gladiator," Masterpiece
","The movie directed by Ridley Scott. General Maximus, the leader of Romanian army has been sentenced to death by new emperor Commodus. He managed to escape, however, he lost everything. His family has been killed in order of Commodus and he has been captured in captivity. He has become a slave and a Gladiator. The movie is amazing. Great acting performance, scenes, story and music. The movie is filled with action from beginning till the end. Both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were great in their roles. The story is really good, everything is well thought and it's hard to find a hole in a plot. And music, music that makes this movie even better. Hanz Zimmer is a genius and you can see it in this movie. I can say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10,1,1,24 May 2017
