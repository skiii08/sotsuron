Blade Runner 2049," Interesting but it has negative sides too
","So basically film has some pros and cons and I will start with pros. Pros of the movie:*It looks visually perfect;
*The actors are persuasive;
*Nice name of the movie;
*The ending which I didn't expect(I believed that the main actor(android dude) is going to be the chosen one but it wasn't :O);Cons of the movie:*Too much attention has been given to insignificant things;
*Didn't like the episode of ballerina which was created by CCCP(film shouldn't promote returning of CCCP);
*I didn't understand why the main leader of androids(a blind guy) is killing other androids if he said that there are not enough of them. It seems illogical;To sum up the film wasn't so bad I would recommend it for everyone because it was interesting despite its cons.",7,0,1,21 March 2018
Captain Marvel," 8
","Well that was the best movie of 2019 so far. There was some cringe scenes and very bad effects with planes but plot and idea was fine. I found it very interesting,jokes were lame and old but that kitty helped this movie a lot. If you're fan of MARVEL you have to watch it.",8,4,13,13 March 2019

The Babadook," Pure true
","Film is way toooo long, visuals look very cheap, there are no horror elements,scenes,nothing to be scared of. The idea of the movie is good but that's it. Basically I wouldn't watch this film second time.",5,0,0,12 April 2018
Us," 7
",Well the movie was kind of interesting. Wasn't like masterpiece or worst of everything. It was a bit better than average. Not a lot of horror elements but still idea and plot is kind of attractive apart from the ending which was really lame.,7,1,5,15 June 2019
Knives Out," 6
","Well it looked very willing but it didn't shine. It's just average,medium level film. Plot looked interesting and funny (from the trailer) but it was like 1/10 of whole movie. Was it worth money for the ticket? I believe not.",6,2,4,14 December 2019
Superbad," 5
",It was too late for me. It had only few good and funny scenes other were cringe.,5,1,5,8 February 2020
Aquaman," 8
",Really nice action movie. Of course it wasn't amazing avengers was better. There are some boring scenes where people are talking too much and when action is starting the scene is overcrowded and it's very hard to fallow the plot. Sum up very nice DC movie. Worth to watch. 8/10.,8,1,4,27 January 2019

Suicide Squad," 5
","I would say very average movie. Nothing special. I was really expecting more. It's just messy killing stupid action film. From the title of the movie and from the popularity it had I was willing something like Avengers but it's meh,basic... too basic for me.",5,0,0,4 December 2018

Bird Box," 7
","Very similar to quiet place. It's like when your friend is asking for your homework and he gives you them just replies 'change something' so this happened here. Totally film wasn't bad,enjoyable to watch not as brilliant as quiet place but still works for me. As a NETFLIX movie this is A class.",7,0,2,12 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," 8
","Very nice cartoon movie. I didn't expect it's going to be so good. I though it was created only because they wanted to promote black skin spider-Man but it was awesome.Had some really funny jokes, interesting plot. The best film to relax.",8,4,6,27 February 2019

Avengers: Endgame," 9
",That's what I call ideal ending. It was really interesting to watch this film from first to the last minute. Film is over 3 hour long however it wasn't too long for me. Yeah Iron Man died. Which was brave from his still I'm not a fan of Iron Man so it was Okay from me. Plot was almost a masterpiece just one detail was really hideous. Why Avengers waited for 5 years to kill Thanos it's just a little bit nonsense. However movie was amazing 9/10. Worth all the awards.,9,40,64,15 June 2019
The Lion King," 7
","To see something what was masterpiece before and trying to compete or even be better than it it's impossible. I agree that new Lion King movie had amazing visuals (except from the sky which looked so bad and fake and the black tree which was moving like a hand lol) but emotionally it's so poor. It didn't give any emotion when dad died, when Simba run away. Nothing. I watch it like ordinary cartoon nothing more for true. Was it worth to watch? Well it wasn't so bad but it doesn't give half of original film chills.",7,0,5,19 July 2019

Coco," 9
","Really adorable movie with hearts melting plot. It was funny,good jokes, interesting to watch not just for kids but for the whole family. Maybe I wouldn't prefer that Coco died at the ending but as it shows she has life after death which makes it not so sad. Totally worth to watch.",9,0,1,12 July 2019
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," 10
","It was absolutely masterpiece. It's hardly possible to find movies like this. That could tell something about history(past),about friendship and the ending was so cruel which made this film legendary one of the best I've seen in my whole life.",10,1,1,16 March 2019
Blood Diamond," 10

",Very funny and interesting animation film for adults. Very recommended.,9,1,1,11 December 2018
Joker," 8
",From my close friends/family member and commentators who saw this film it was willing a lot. After I saw this film I can say it was really good and decent BUT it's a little bit overrated and over hyped. The idea to show why person became mental break (Joker) was very nice it looked very realistic BUT the main problem is it's not drag you inside. Really hard to describe that feeling. I can only compare with kind of equivalent move 'Split' where the main character had personality disorder he fulfilled all he's character so good it was amazing to watch. And now when you see 'Joker' the main character doesn't give that feeling. Maybe actors wasn't right for this character. I'm not sure.,8,1,6,11 October 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," 8
",Love this movie. Some kind of funny. Great songs. Amazing ending.,8,0,0,9 January 2019
It Chapter Two," 6
","Hmm well it's really hard to write write about this movie. Watching first part and seeing how amazing directors,scene writers and actors can be and then this hmm... lets call it ' movie' happens... It's really sad. This part was a huge disappointment. Highly promoted everywhere as scariest movie of 2019 and it flopped. Film started very interesting with a little bit of cruel which you can expect but then it became fantasy of skeletons,monsters,shining parody... It was too crowded with minor subjects that main object - Pennywise lost his value. It was even impossible to compare first and second parts. Maximum point for this movie is very very soft 6.",6,1,3,7 September 2019

Finding Dory," 8

The Terminal," 9
",Really amazing movie with great idea to talk about serious world problems. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg did amazing job. Thanks.,9,1,1,6 December 2018
Parasite," 10
","This is just a pure masterpiece. You can see movies like this one only once in couple years. It was intense, interesting plot, amazing actors. Everyone was telling me like first half was OK, but second was boring so film is just Meh. How dare you? If you're basic person who loves only MARVEL or DC films of course this movie is not for you, but if you want to see something more deeper than that pick this one you won't regret. Totally recommended, my favourite movie of 2019.",10,1,2,27 March 2020

Mother!," Hmmm
",Jennifer Lawrence is amazing actress but if she's going to participate in such movies she will destroy her career forever. The whole two hours I was like wtf is going on here...
