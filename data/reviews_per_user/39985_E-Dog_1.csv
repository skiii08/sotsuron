Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE!!!!!
","I couldn't believe what was being said about this great film.  How could you possibly not like this movie.  It had it all, AMAZING special effects, a good story A GOOD SCRIPT and GOOD ACTING.  That's right, you heard me. All you people who were looking for an AFI film why don't you go cry your eyes out again to TITANIC (which I think SUCKED).  And also will everyone quit complaining about Jar-Jar Binks.  He was so dumb its funny. If you think Jar Jar is dumb then Adam Sandler acting like a retard is dumb.  If you want 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure excitement and wonder.  See this Movie.  It is a rollar coaster ride, adrenaline pumping, dream movie.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
