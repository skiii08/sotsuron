Minority Report," Cool Movie...
","I really enjoyed this flick. It is a really good story about a technology that isn't really all that farfetched considering the things we can do with cloning. The director does an excellent job of keeping the movie dark in order to portray what a dark, cold world it is. 9/10",9,0,0,21 April 2003
Dark City," A cool movie...
",Overall this movie was pretty good. I am glad that I took other people's advice and listened to the first 30 seconds of the movie with the volume muted. It made the movie so much better! I liked the entire movie except for the ending. The ending just wasn't good.,8,0,2,15 June 2003
