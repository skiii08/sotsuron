Marie Antoinette," Beautiful costumes, decent acting, horrible soundtrack
","Wow a treat for the eye with the beautiful costumes, scenery and spectacular palaces! The acting was good also but the rock music soundtrack ruined it for me. So out of place. I would have given this a 9 except for that. Also noticed before Marie was married they call her madam. Shouldn't it be mademoiselle before a woman is married?",3,1,2,19 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," Name of movie should be 'Morons In Space'
",This movie was totally predictable from beginning to end. The ship had the stupidest crew that ever went into space. No logic or reason whatsoever. You can remove the word science from science fiction. I guess this was just another sequel of many to make money instead of having a decent story line. What a waste of my time.,1,3,6,6 July 2017
