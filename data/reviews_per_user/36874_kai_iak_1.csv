50 First Dates," Memento reloaded
","Loosing memory..... I have seen this before!: yes, this film is a 'light' version of 'Memento', the plot is exactly the same, just add a love story.Sandler & Barrymore are OK but the storyboard is so so much predictable......... Again, we have seen all this in so so many movies. A very easy mix: 'Memento' + any love story = 50 first dates. Hollywood, we have a problem!Surely it is not a bad movie, it made me smile and even laugh sometimes (I thank that and rated it 6/10), but if you really want to watch a good movie try 'Memento' first!",5,0,0,24 March 2006
