Iron Man 3," Not an iron man movie...
","When the movie ended, i was so furious and disappointed, i was hoping shane black was somewhere around so i can bash him in the face with my motorcycle helmet.Such a failure it was that i started having second thoughts about going to the theaters to watch man of steel.Not have really much to say that it hasn't already been posted. I went to see iron man kicking ass and what i got was a crappy suit that when it wasn't malfunctioning, or torn to pieces from super human villains as if it was made of paper, it was breaking apart like a garbage can.That was about half of the action scenes of the movie with the other half watching stark performing as james bond, jumping high walls with ease or neutralizing 2 or 3 enemies at the same time with high tech gadjets.Left me wondering if he actually needed the suit.. I was expecting to see breath taking action and i ended up counting the minutes for the movie to end, just so i can justify my money and time.A mediocre action-comedy film that could be easily rented on DVD.OK marvel you got my money this time let me see you try that again..",2,14,28,30 April 2013
Man of Steel," Bring singer back...
","Or 'be careful what you wish for cause you might just get it' could be the title as well.After that iron man 3 failure i was dying for a superhero movie full with action and cant say i was disappointed,at least in that part.Although the setup was a bit too fast paced for me.But anyway lets agree that it has some good action sequences.I cannot describe you the technical aspects of the movie nor is my interest.But i can tell you that the result is a flat,emotionless blockbuster that fluctuates between boredom and apathy, and it only serves as an excuse to kill some time away from your daily routine.After it ends,there is nothing really memorable to keep besides the heavy explosions and buildings collapsing.Perhaps its bad acting or most likely a bad written script, or its just that this whole conception of superman being and outcast,trying to fit into humanity doesn't really work out.Or its simply the absence of the unforgettable original soundtrack that accompanied all the previous movies, and in the mind of all those (including me ), who have watched all the superman movies is so irreversibly connected to the series.Maybe there was potential in the idea of superman striving to be accepted as a friendly alien, but i don't think that idea was depicted in a satisfying way.All in all you wont get that feeling that you wasted your money but that's just about it.And its certainly not as good as superman returns... 5/10 its a fair rating.",5,2,5,25 June 2013
