The Monuments Men," A Loving Memoir
","I don't know what the critics expected this movie to be.. an action flick? a thriller? a war movie? Actually it is a war movie. It shows some of the worst of what happened to human beings during WWII. Clooney also takes the time to allow us to meet these men, who could easily have stayed out of it. Who instead, made the heroic choice to put themselves in great danger to save the soul of humanity - its art. Kudos to Clooney for not cheapening their story with the traditional Hollywood 'flick'. I did not know about this history event and I found it interesting and absorbing and I fell in love with every one of those men and I thank them for what they did.",9,76,137,9 February 2014
In Bruges," This is NOT a Comedy
","This movie is listed as Genre: Action, Comedy. If this is a comedy, then 'There Will Be Blood' should be listed as such. As with '...Blood', there are moments of humor in this film, but this material weighs in more as a serious drama with very dark moments. The performances in this drama were excellent. Had I gone into the theater expecting a drama, I would have enjoyed it more (if enjoyed is the word to use for a violent film). Instead, I felt ripped by the depth of serious issues portrayed. It is well done, but don't go expecting a comedy. It's a tragedy with a number of violent scenes - I can't imagine what the other commenters thought was so funny.",8,1,5,18 February 2008
The Holiday," Too cutesy writing and a waste of amazing actors
","The writer took an interesting concept and waxed cute instead of substantial. I spent the first half hour waiting for the movie to get beyond very predictable 'Cameron' and 'Kate' stereotypical moments. Wondered why these actors ever said yes to this script. (Except that everyone is shot in the most Hollywood gorgeous manner - Jude Law and Cameron Diaz couldn't look more delectable.) Given nothing going on in the movie, just cut to Cameron or Jude looking fabulous. Just when I thought the film was a total waste, it did have some very interesting moments. However, you can hear the writing in spite of the fact that each actor is working very hard to make the script work. It was a pleasant enough movie, but I had hoped for so much more, with these four actors. Eli Wallach stole the movie for my tastes.",5,6,14,3 December 2006
The Proposal," Naysayers wake up!
","This movie is EXACTLY what you expect... a romantic summer comedy. It's not rocket science or brain surgery. There are no surprises, so why are people upset with that? Sandra Bullock is one of the greatest comediennes of our day. Her physical comedy is brilliant. The best part of this movie is that she gets out of the way of her fellow thespians and let's them steal scenes. Ryan Reynolds goes toe to toe with her and holds his own, if not bests her at times. Betty White just RIPS it in every scene she's in. I can just imagine Sandra saying 'do your thing!'. The script has enough substance to hold it together and actually has a few surprises. It's a Doris Day /Cary Grant movie. And yes, some of the scenes seem to be steals from other movies (even one of Bullock's own), but other movies steal from other, other movies. And wasn't it Shakespeare who said there are on 10 stories? If you want to sit back, relax, laugh and be charmed, I recommend this movie.",10,2,7,27 June 2009
Furious 7," I loved it!
","I had not seen any of the earlier films in the series, so this was my first introduction to any of the characters. After reading all the 'Hated It' reviews I went to see it anyway, due mainly to the pre-release interviews I had seen. I am a senior citizen and might be too old for it, but surprise! I still found it fun, surprisingly funny and engaging, with certainly plenty of crazy breathtaking, daredevil action sequences. I fell in love with the characters. I did not find the story confusing at any point - don't know what the naysayers are complaining about. Now I feel I should rent the earlier movies and watch them. Kudos to the team for a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours.",10,3,9,4 April 2015
