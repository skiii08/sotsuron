The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," This was such a good movie!!
","I loved the first Twilight movie and then New Moon was OK, and I actually really enjoyed Eclipse!! This movie was really good, and a lot of people are saying that they added to much stuff to the movie and could have made it shorter, you guys have no idea what you are talking about; this shows that most of you people have obviously not read the books! I absolutely loved the book, and was kinda of disappointed with the amount of scenes that they CUT OUT and/ or SHORTENED!!! There were scenes that I was actually looking forward to watching. I understand that this movie can't be extremely long, but some of the other movies were like 2 and a half hours, and this movie wasn't even 2 hours. I really did enjoy this film, but I really wish that they would have added some of those additional scenes. Also, most people, for some reason, just don't really want to read the books, (they are really good and you should read them) and if you haven't, then you probably didn't understand some of it because without those additional scenes or additional parts of scenes, they didn't really do a good job of explaining some stuff. Even though I am saying all of this, I still really did enjoy the movie, it's just that a lot of reviews are saying that they should have shortened it, which really makes me mad because they have no idea what they are talking about, and should really read the books! If you haven't seen it you totally should, and if you haven't read the books, please do!!! They are so good, and the movies can't tell someone that the books aren't amazing, because they are!! If you are a big Twilight fan, then you really need to read the books!! I hope this helps some people!!",9,3,11,21 November 2011
Tangled," Disney's princess movies are back!!
","I absolutely loved this movie!! Disney originally tried making another princess movie a few years ago, Princess and the Frog. That movie was not good at all!! Disney is known for their amazing princess movies, and that was not one of them, and I have know idea what happened with that movie! Now that Disney has made this movie, they are back on top with their incredible princess movies!! The music was wonderful, and the movie was a little different from their usual princess movies. This one was funner and more modern, but they still had the whole princess feel to it, which is what Disney is known for! Disney's other movies, that don't have music, and aren't a princess movie that have been coming out over the years are good too. They just haven't made a princess movie like this one since The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. I would definitely watching this movie, no matter what age! Especially if you grew up watching their princess movie, I absolutely know that you will love this movie!",10,32,36,11 January 2012
Grease," Love this movie and especially the music!
","This was seriously my life as a child growing up! I first saw this movie with my parents when I was 5 and clearly didn't understand really anything, but I loved the music! I'm now 15 and have owned the CD since I was probably 5-6 years old and asked for the DVD for my 7th birthday! I still love listening to the music and know every word to every song because I've listened to this music for about 10 years now, and I still do all of the time. It's such a good movie, but I literally saw it 100 times as a child, so now I'm kind of sick of watching it, but I will never be sick of the music! What makes Grease is the music! I love musicals and yes I like the actual storyline and all but the best part is the music! A must see! You will love it!",10,0,1,19 February 2013
Footloose," This was a very good movie!
","I really enjoyed watching this movie, but the one thing that irritated me was Ariel, I just DID NOT like her character, and have no idea why Ren would take an interest in her. I know that she was very pretty, but she was annoying and thought that she was the best thing in the world and she was a slut. I know that that's not even what the movie was about, it just really bothered me.I would recommend watching this movie because it is something different, but in a good way. This small town in Georgia has made dancing illegal, which we all know would probably NEVER happen. It's about this one guy who moves from a big city to this small town and fights against the court trying to make it legal again. I do live in Atlanta, Georgia, and I do know that people here don't have a strong southern accent because we live in such a big city with many different people from around the world. I do know what people sound like outside of Atlanta, and the way they sounded in the movie was not it, but it didn't bother me that much. Willard was probably the only person who sounded like a true Georgia southerner. I would definitely watch this movie!!",7,2,5,1 July 2012
Titanic," This movie is the best movie of all time!
","This movie in my opinion deserves nothing less than 8 stars because it is such a masterpiece. It definitely showed the tragedy of the Titanic because the whole sinking of the Titanic in the movie was done in such detail that you really learned and could feel how tragic it was! For most men to come on here and write bad reviews about this movie, just don't, because the romance between Jack and Rose was for girls and to make the movie a romantic tragedy. Making it a romantic tragedy made the movie more sad so we could feel even more how much of a tragedy it was! Men obviously don't like romance like that, but the way the did the sinking scene was fabulous! I am a girl so I loved the romance between Jack and Rose, and I think that it truly added more to the movie, because you have to have a story line for a movie that you don't want to make a documentary. The story line was amazing because back then everything was about if you are 1st class, 2nd class, or 3rd class, and you could really see how the 3rd class people were treated compared to the 1st class people because Jack was a very, very poor 3rd class man, and Rose was a 1st class woman engaged to such a wealthy man. If you are a guy you won't really like the romance story line, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. If you are a girl I would definitely recommend watching this movie! I did cry, A LOT! So be prepared if you are someone who does cry during movies!",10,1,5,15 April 2012
