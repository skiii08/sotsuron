The Finest Hours," Very good film, don't listen to the few negative reviews
","I am really not sure what movie the people were watching that wrote negative reviews on here. Boring? Not a chance, Slow? Not a chance, Wooden acting? No way, Disaster with Disney heroes? maybe, exciting? Yes, Heartwarming story? Yes, Well made? Yes. I don't really understand why some people watch movies, because there was absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. It had believable characters, a very good story and great special effects and in my opinion if you did not like it, you really have no business watching movies, because nothing will please you. I hope the few negative reviews don't keep people from watching and enjoying this great American heroes story. Watch and enjoy. And, be proud you are an American.",10,3,9,6 April 2016
The Impossible," A Must See Movie
",At first I did not think this movie was something I would like to see. I felt it would be one of those movies that once the disaster happened it would become dis-interesting and would be boring the second half of the movie. I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event. If there were exaggerations in this movie they were seamless and not over done. If you have a chance to see this movie I feel it is 'a must see movie' you will not be disappointed.,9,215,284,27 November 2012
Groundhog Day," Boring
","If you like seeing the same thing over and over again, you will LOVE this movie. For me it was about as tedious and boring of a movie as you can get. I like Bill Murray but I could not stand this movie as the synopsis states it repeated Groundhog Day over and over again. I am not sure what the people that gave this 10 stars or near 10 stars were watching but next to Ishtar this move really sucked. The same thing happens, the same thing happens, the same thing happens, the same thing happens, get the point? Till basically the end. I was ready to shoot myself but then it did finally end. I just remember thinking it would be the last time they would repeat Groundhog day but it kept going till I finally made it through the movie. If I would have known how many times they were going to repeat it I would have turned it off after the second time. Well, I think you get the point I am starting to sound like the movie.",1,18,72,4 January 2012
Mother!," What did F did I just see?
","I love movies, I also give a ton of leeway for movies that don't have all their ducks lined in a row. I see movies for the entertainment value, basically 'am I entertained'? I also like many types of movies, from fantasies to westerns. One of my favorite genres is horror. When I saw Mother! I was horrified, not because of the genre, because I was horrified that someone actually thought of this garbage. It is probably one of the most pointless, useless, ridiculous, irritating, frustrating, movies, I have ever wasted time watching. After watching the movie, I left the theater, and said to my friend 'What the F did I just see'? If you like stupid, pointless, weird movies, this may be the one for you and those three words, are putting it mildly.",1,1,2,20 December 2017
