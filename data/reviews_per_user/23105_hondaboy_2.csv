Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too much hype, not enough filmmaking.
","Let's not start off on the wrong foot here. I appreciate the Star Wars series as a landmark in movie history, as a paragon of special effects, and as a cultural phenomenon. However, I don't understand why the 'movie event of 1999' had to be so...mediocre.Regardless of what George Lucas or anyone else says, Jar Jar appears to be the prime focus of this movie. No, not because he's incredibly important to the Star Wars saga (geez, I sure hope he's not, anyway) but because his inane portion of the dialogue and 'acting' really seem to hit home with the kids. Consider the number of children you see wearing Jar Jar Binks T-shirts. Also consider that the single-most common Star Wars action figure bought at my particular discount retail store seems to be the 'lovable' Jar Jar Binks. If lines like 'How wude!' are the future of talking action figures, I may start melting some plastic. But never mind the merchandising, let's get back to the target audience. Kids love this movie and the three earlier editions, which is probably the main reason (besides massive amounts of money) for Lucas to make this one.As a motion picture, I was unimpressed with Episode 1. All the special effects in the world can't make up for a generally boring story. But the thing is, no one can really regard this movie as just another story committed to film. You have to take it as a part of the Star Wars series.In that context, it's still a boring story. But I got a kick out of seeing where the storylines began. Who knew that the decrepit Emperor Palpatine of Episode 4 started out as a bland Senator on Coruscant? Or that C-3PO was built by that annoying little monkey, Anakin? (Which I find hard to believe, by the way.)It's not a special movie, but it's worth renting - after the next two come out. Then we'll see if Episode 1 really makes a difference in the Star Wars world.Because it sure as heck didn't do anything on this planet.",Null,0,1,16 September 1999
Alien," Male-female relations hampered by a Darwinist catastrophe
","In the future, all 'haunted house' movies ought to take place on intergalactic spaceships. Well, not really, but you have to admit the concept works - at least when the movie you're talking about is Alien. (Or maybe the most recent Friday the 13th flick, but I digress.)Long story short, the crew towing a mining freighter (the Nostromo) back home is awakened from hibernation to investigate a distress signal sent from a nearby planet. Upon landing, the ship that presumably sent the signal is found to be lifeless and covered with an odd substance. Kane, the crew member volunteering to check out the lower hull of the dead ship, finds what appear to be eggs and is attacked by an odd alien being. Upon returning him to the ship for medical treatment - that is, getting the alien off his face - the crew wonders what fate might be in store for Kane and themselves. Luckily, the facehugger eventually detaches itself and dies, leaving Kane to wake up and rejoin his mates. And it's at just about that point that all hell breaks loose on the Nostromo...Without giving too much more away, I should make one thing clear. Alien is not a kind, gentle movie about friendly creatures. The alien in Alien pretty much wants to kill you and everything you love. It appears to have minimal compassion for any living thing, least of all humans - which are, probably correctly, viewed as a threat.And the alien isn't even the most important part of the movie. What is more intriguing is director Ridley Scott's conception of future gender relations. Aboard the Nostromo, 'male' is the dominant theme for both sexes - after all, the uniform (shirt, pants, optional jacket or hat) is pretty much the same either way. Females, for the most part, are forced to think and act in the same way as males - Ripley's tough demeanor, especially in the first half of the film, is the best example of this ideal. Lambert represents a more traditional female ethos, but her fate shows that such a forgiving attitude will not be advantageous in the future.And in that vein, there's one more interesting way to look at the film. The ship - nicknamed 'Mother' by her crew - effectively serves as a technological counter to the entirely natural alien incubator on the 'dead' ship. Both are adept at keeping their living cargo safe, and both are surprisingly mechanical in the way they do so. Obviously, this is to be expected from Mother (who is a digital entity, after all) but is interesting coming from a natural life form. But when one thinks about it, an evolution into which a creature exists only to feed and reproduce is maybe inevitable in the end.Now, to rate the film. Alien is technically beautiful, both from a directorial-cinematic point of view and in a design sense. To be specific, great acting and camerawork allied to truly lifelike sets make you feel as if you're a crew member. Not to mention scaring the living daylights out of you at times. It's a true classic, both for the way in which it tackles the subject of interstellar life forms and for the fact that it's simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking.Rating: 3.5 out of 4 stars (thus, a 7-star IMDb rating)",Null,0,1,16 September 2002
