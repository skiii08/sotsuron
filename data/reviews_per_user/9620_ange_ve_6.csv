Stop-Loss," Predictable-' Until war do us part '
","I really decided I'm gonna watch this movie for the actors and actors only. You know,Ryan Philippe and Channing Tatum both together in the same movie it's like a dream. I found to realize that what supposed to be a good military movie actually became a friendship-romance triangle. I kept thinking,when is Philippe gonna sleep with Michelle(Tatum s girlfriend). The tension was keeping me awake for the first 30 minutes. I also predicted that Tommy is going to kill himself as the last scene where he holds the guitar and everything starts to turn to slow-motion scene. The director gave a little more softer side to guys than it should. Even the girls in the movie are stronger and manly than the male characters. I really liked the memory-scenes where they kept rewinding the Iraq situation. Finally isn't it great that Philippe changed his mind after 1h.40 min and decided to be 'the man' and support his friend in good and bad until war do us part? This movie is based on a very girly point of view of war",5,1,1,4 August 2009
The Notebook," A Love story everyone dreams of !!
","When i first got The Notebook,i had no idea what the movie is about,who the actors were and i was 17.I just played the movie and i thought ' Oh My God,I hate old fashion movies'. So it just set in my room for almost two months until this day when i was so lazy to watch anything else and i decided to watch this movie.And,boy,was I shocked. It is the most unbelievable love story ever written.It doesn't remind me of anything else,so it is very original.This one had the perfect cast,the greatest actors and it kinda made me feel like they were in love since always.Of course,no love story is a love story without a little drama and tragedy,but that's what outshines every other movie.I won't describe the story,I'll leave you to experience it..and I'll just say ---I sang 'I'll be seeing you' in the next six months and I wished i could live that romance. Enjoy !",10,0,1,19 February 2010
500 Days of Summer," When the magic happens...
","I give this movie a nine because it is one of the most amazing love stories told unconventionally.It is extremely unusual and weird,the way the characters are developed and the way the story goes. There are things that you can and things that you can't predict.It will take you right into your relationship and you'll say ' Yeah I know,right??,I've done that too '. Still this movie lives on memories and they are brought up together in a perfect manner that will 'wow' you in the end.Needless to say,the cast is amazing the acting and the sarcastic humor are at the top level.This movie will kill you with reality and truth.Amazing!",9,1,2,3 March 2010
Legends of the Fall," Brad Pitt's best role EVER!!
","When i first saw this movie i was very little but i still could remember the golden long hair of Brad and his wild temper. When i grew up i saw it over 50 times and i still discover something new. The story is developed on so many levels that you have to be very careful when you observe the characters. Each one of them struggles with his/her's story,problems doubts. I think this movie really sets the question-How far can love go? and I don't mean only the romantic love but also the love for the family for the country for yourself. I couldn't decide whose character was played better,but i don't think that no one did it like Brad Pitt and Sir Anthony. This movie made me wonder: How can we judge and who do we judge,when it comes to love? And finally---have you ever heard sweeter name than Tristan? mmmmm",10,1,4,4 August 2009
No Country for Old Men," Lacking purpose and words!
","I personally love,and absolutely adore every single Coen's movie,but this was a total disappointment! The story is a complete 'deja vu' although the actors are great.What i didn't like about this movie is the slow motion of every single scene.Nothing special,no music to make the adrenalin pumping,no hard words or if may,no words at all.The beginning and the end were the one and only moments where something good something meaningful was said.Many unnecessary characters were introduced and that made this movie seem insignificant.I would be more pleased if 'Burn after reading ' won an Oscar-that movie was great! Since I know Coen's style i figured that although this movie is boring the ending will be worth seeing.And Tommy Lee Jones didn't make that happen.The cast was great the idea was good,the directors were incredible...but this movie lacked purpose and magic.if you ask for thrill this is not the movie for you.I don't mind saying,it was also very predictable...and the characters were not completely formed.Not worthy an Oscar!",3,2,5,20 February 2010
The Departed," And thats how perfection is defined !
","The Departed is a Martin Scorsese's film,where once again the greatness of this director is proved.Leonardo DiCaprio is obviously his unspoken muse which i respect completely.Anyone who says that Leonardo is just a pretty face with no acting skills,has no clue about movies or actors.His magnificent performance is going to leave you with your mouth open and probably will make fall of your chair.I put this movie along with 'Usual Suspects' as one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The story follows two policeman working for or against the government.If you think the story is already seen,think again.Scorsese manages to develop intriguing and unpredictable history of movies. Every character is prepared and worked out with great amount of dedication and hard work.Jack Nicholson (you can love him or not ) but his craziness and eccentricity work unbelievably in this motion picture.A role of a mafia boss is so suitable for him,that afterward you won't be able to picture him differently. I must say,Matt Daemon is not my favorite actor,but this is the movie where i changed my opinion.He is brilliant! The music is amazing.You will hear great Irish sounds mixed with a dose of hard rock which suits the movie perfectly. Martin Sheen is another perfect contribution to this movie making it complete and amazing.Still,my favorite character in this movie remains Mark Wahlberg that will 'wow' you with his extraordinary performance and great,funny,but meaningful dialogs. This movie does deserve to win not one,not four but many Oscars and to find its place in the 'best movies of all times' list ! One of the greatest movies ever ! A true masterpiece and definitely a must see !",10,0,4,20 February 2010
