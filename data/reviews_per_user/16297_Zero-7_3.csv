Antz," Language...What Language
","Wow, I saw this movie on the weekend and thought it was great. While I'm not usually a fan of Woody Allen I absolutely loved his character. But why oh why  does everyone seem to be complaining about the 'bad' language thats supposedly containted in this film. What the big deal about Crap or Damn? these are words used regularly in common conversation! I would have no hesitation in taking younger children to see this great film.",Null,0,0,25 October 1998
Dark City," Alex Proyas=God?
","Wow is it possible that Alex Proyas has outdone himself? The eternal question...is Dark City or The Crow the best film ever made? This film is so cool, the acting is great the sets are fantastic, the general atmosphere is amazing but of course it is the story and script that makes the movie! I literally walked out of the theater with goosebumps.Kiefer Sutherland is nothing less than brillant as Dr. Schreiber.",9,0,1,25 October 1998
Event Horizon," Wow
",What a great movie. When I went to see this I want sure what to expect but I was absolutely amazed. This tension filled thriller was amazing and the ending was one of the best I have ever seen. The set was a brilliant blend of science fiction and Gothic. In the vein of Aliens - truly amazing,Null,0,0,6 October 1998
