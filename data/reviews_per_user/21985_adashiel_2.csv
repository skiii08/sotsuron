Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'See it again for the first time.'
","This is definitely a movie that you need to see more than once.  The first time I saw Phantom Menace, it was difficult to see past the hype, anticipation and my own preconceived notions.  By the end I was left feeling, well, a bit disoriented.  At first I rationalized and nitpicked, finding fault with everything from the acting to the special effects. However, none of my complaints -- just like those of all the reviewers I've read -- rang true with what my gut was telling me. I realized that I was missing something, so I went to see it again.  This time it clicked:  my prejudices fell away and I was simply awestruck.  It is a truly magnificent film: see it again for the first time.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," It was much better than Cats...
","What amazes me about the Shawshank Redemption is that I can watch it over and over again without losing interest.  Normally for me, even with movies I enjoy, once is enough.  However, when I'm channel surfing and I flip across Shawshank, I almost always leave it on and watch it to the end.",10,0,0,8 January 2000
