The Blair Witch Project," Is that it?
","I was left unfulfilled after seeing Blair Witch. Just as it got mildly exciting, the movie was over! I joined the queue of 20 or 30 other people waiting to get their money refunded when coming out. Over-hyped, no story, no thrills, no scares, nothing even remotely psychological.",Null,0,1,25 August 1999
Saw," Best psychological horror film in years.
","SAW proves you don't need a multi-million dollar budget and heaps of special effects to make a great film. It's more psychologically graphic than visually, and the great ending won't be guessed by anyone (unlike the Sixth Sense which about half the audience figured out 20 minutes into the film). SAW is a slick film with the lead writer also being the lead actor. There's virtually no big names in it, but that helps it more than anything. This film would flop with big-name actors and Hollywood cash behind it, because it would have been formulaic. Better than Sixth Sense, better than Seven, better than Unbreakable. Jigsaw masks should be a big seller for Halloween 2005.",10,0,0,1 November 2004
A Night at the Roxbury," Makes you want to nod your head.
","A lot of people tried to put me off seeing this movie, but given that I like SNL, especially the 'old school' SNL, I went along anyway. I'm glad I did. I haven't laughed so much at a film for ages. The music is pumping, the brothers completely out of touch with reality, and the psycho bunny-boiler girlfriend is genuinely scarey. Makes you want to nod your head in time to the music, just like the Bizarre Butabi Brothers.",Null,2,2,21 October 1998
