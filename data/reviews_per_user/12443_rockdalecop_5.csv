The Incredible Hulk," Mediocre
","I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not pleased with this film. I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it. First I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line I don't think. I guess the best part of the film was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why?. Now I know. I was hoping to to get blown away, but I was not.",4,2,4,12 September 2009
Star Trek," Mediocre
","I've never been much of a Trekie, so I approached this film with an open mind. All I can say is the Special Effects were incredible. At times the sequences moved a little too fast, so I was not able to truly appreciate the Special Effects. Now, with that being said, here comes the negatives. The story was lame. It did not have the same impact I had when the very first star trek movie came out many moons ago. Remember the Voager thing? It was really cool. This one had some crazy space ship that really appeared to steal the show. My favorite choice for the actors was Karl Urban. I was waiting for the famous 'Dammit Jim' and I was not disappointed. All in all, it's not too bad. But in this case, great special effects did not make up for a crappy story portrayed by a bunch of unknown actors.",5,0,3,19 November 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Very Good
","I've never been a fan of Hero movies in general. I'm one of the few that didn't care for any of the Batman films or the Hulk ones, as for that matter, I didn't care to see the Fantastic 4 films either It was the trailer for this film attracted me to it. I thought this film was very good. The action was excellent. The special effects were intense. The actors were very good as well. I remember seeing a little bit of the first x men film and I did not care for it too much. I feel the film makers did an excellent job making this like the Star War films did a few years back. This film is very explosive which is always a plus for me. I guess I need to watch the other x men films now.",9,1,3,18 September 2009
Terminator Salvation," Kicked ASS!!!
","This movie delivered what I was expecting. Wall to wall action and incredible effects. Once again, we are treated to yet another installment which surpasses the previous in overall grandeur. The actors were good but best of all, the film was a treat for the eyes and ears. Again, McG delivers unrealistic stuff in a realistic manner. Yeah the stunts and the effects were a little hard to swallow but, that is what we want to see in a big summer flick. All I can hope is for another installment. I wont comment on the story line simply because if you're a Terminator fan, you should already know the story. This is just to sit back and have a good time. All the idiots that criticize the film need to go to your local movie rental outfit and rent from the Special Interest section or perhaps the Foreign sections.",9,2,4,2 December 2009
The Expendables," Explosive!!!!
","This movie as I expected was full of fire. The guys were awesome. To me personally, Dolph was the best. Sly did a great job giving all the guys equal amount of screen time and dialogue (with the exception of Crews), but all in all, I think Dolph was the most entertaining. Then Statham. His role was cool, especially the payback scene. Jet Li was hilarious. The film also had its fair share of blood and guts as expected from a Sly directed film. It had all the necessary ingredients: Explosions, shootouts, chases, funny one liners and blood. I hope this film brings Dolph back to the main screen. All in all, it made for a fun time at the movie theater.",9,3,15,14 August 2010
