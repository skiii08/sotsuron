The New World," Remarkable film work
","I purchased a copy of this film and was therefore able to stop and go back when I wanted to and thus study the film. When I first started watching it I thought it was poorly edited as things seemed to jump from scene to scene but as it progressed I found myself engrossed in the beauty of it. I did a some research about the characters and from what I found out the relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith as depicted in the film is pure fiction. Pocahontas was eleven years old when she met Smith and although they became friends there was no romance between them.The actors in the film were excellent and romantic scenes between Colin Farrell, Christain Bale and Q'Orianka Kilcher where filmed tastefully as they had to be since Q'Orianka was 14 when she made this film. Frankly if my 14 year old daughter was filming a romantic scene with Farrell I would be near the filming watching him like a hawk.I would suggest that anybody watching the great movie should observe it from an artistic standpoint and not try to get involved in the styling.",10,2,5,6 September 2006
