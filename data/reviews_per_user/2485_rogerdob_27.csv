Lucky Number Slevin," Totally unbelievable film
","This film is one of those films that can't work if just ONE of the unbelievable setups doesn't happen. This film tries to entertain you by twists and surprises in the plot. For the first hour one wonders what is going on and how this whole movie will tie together. However, as the ending approaches and the plot is revealed, one cannot help realize how impossible the whole story is. There are so many times where one wonders how did they know that was going to happen that exact way. For example, when josh Harnett explains to Lucy Lui how Bruce Willis will shoot at her and at what part of her body, she's all ready for it---she plans to fake her death with an elaborate death scene. He shoots at her body exactly how they thought he would---how convenient for the progression of the plot!",2,19,47,7 April 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Slow and pretentious
","Well, I was confused of what was going on during the first twenty minutes and kept waiting for the picture to 'start.' After the picture got to the main part of the story (which seemed to take forever) I began to realize that this movie took itself a little too seriously. There were far too many overly dramatic closeups with pretentious music . The editing was unnecessarily quick but the movie still moved at a snail's pace. Finally, after suffering through almost two hours the ending proved to be totally unsatisfying and unbelievable (the evil Crowe character, who was totally without any redemption throughout the entire film changed to a 'good' guy almost instantaneously).",2,15,32,7 September 2007
Skyfall," 99% logic free
","This film is a good example of lazy writing. The story is pushed along without any consideration of reality, logic, or sense. The writers wanted something to happen...so it did...with no thought of how to make it logically happen. Computers solve all problems and can search for anything! People escape from inescapable cells without any explanation of how they did it. Elevators are, apparently, now designed so open and dangerous that people can simply jump into the cable and lift area without a problem. Motorcyles can ride on the tiled rooftops of buildings at 60 mph without ever running into the edge of the building. The list goes on and on!We all have to suspend some belief when enjoying a movie...however, this movie takes that premise and carries it to new heights.This movie is the worst James Bond I have ever seen.",1,35,73,9 November 2012
Rocketman," It's a Two Hour Pity Party for Elton!
","I love Elton John...but this movie is nothing but a long pity party for him! The entire movie is obsessed with showing us what a victim he was...people treating him badly and how all these awful things made him resort to drugs, sex, and self hate. 'It wasn't his fault!' Meanwhile, he's the center of the world's attention and making millions. There is not one ounce of joy in this movie. Being a fan of Elton John, I think the movie missed the mark badly by not using Elton's own voice during the songs...the movie needed the brightness and joy of his voice.",1,123,219,6 June 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Horrible...humorless...boring.
",The movie was completely void of any humor or light heartedness except for a extremely few pathetic attempts. The brilliance of the very first Starwars was the action coupled with a sense of fun and adventure. This movie was SO serious that it was boring. The lead actress was quite forgettable in her role and for the first 40 minutes it was extremely hard to keep track of who was who and who was doing what!The other things that began to annoy me was the extreme fast cutting so that it was hard to follow the fights and the pretentious music in the background. The music just reeked of saying 'this movie is important because this music sounds important.' After about an hour we walked out!,Null,3,10,18 January 2017
The Hunger Games," Way too many close-ups!
","This movie was 90% close-ups. There was no opportunity to explore this world with your own eyes...the director kept telling you exactly what you should be looking at...which was usually a close-up of someone talking. The movie had closeups of everything including the faces of horses followed by closeups of their feet trotting. Add a shaky camera and blurred out backgrounds and you have a movie made by an editor rather than a director that knows how to compose shots.This world that this movie took place in looked fascinating, but each shot was only a few seconds long. There was no long shots so that I could study their clothes, hair, and how they moved. A very disappointing movie experience.",1,44,86,24 March 2012
Us," Totally 100% Illogical!
","I know that we, as moviegoers, must often suspend belief in order to enjoy movies. However this film pushes the viewer completely over the limits. Let's count some of them...1) there are millions and millions of dopplegangers of us living in tunnels below us, 2) they were created by the US government, 3) their only source of food are rabbits!, 4) they are all dressed in red clothing (who made the clothing?), 5) no one, absolutely no one, thinks of or suggests getting a gun to protect themselves (such an action would have solved the problem and ended the film early). This film is an embarrasment to horror films...even some of the worst horror films attempt a reason that is somewhat believeable for their premise. Move this film into the discount bin of DVD's at Walmart.",1,884,1213,20 April 2019
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A real lightweight
","There's really nothing much to this film. Very little story, very little excitement, very little humor. It's not a horrible film but it's just not that great. This time, because the ice is melting, the animals have to worry about a flood killing them and they have to find a safe place---that's the whole story. On the way to the safe place the animals experience various bouts with danger. There is also a subplot about Manny (Ray Ramano) thinking he might be the last of his species left.One of the really big problems I had with this film was the celebrity voices used. When Manny speaks, it is REALLY hard to disassociate him from the Ray Romano character on Everyone Loves Raymond. And the same thing applies to Queen Latifah's voice---she's QUEEN LATIFAH!",3,7,23,31 March 2006
Spider-Man 3," Where was the central plot?
","This was basically a plot less movie. Sure there were bad guys and bad things happen. There was some kind of love story going on (Kirsten Dunst was so annoying). There was some action (much less than there should have been). But what was the plot? I challenge anyone to explain what the movie was about in one sentence---it can't be done because there wasn't any plot. This movie was a total waste of time and money. The other things wrong was that it was too long (dosn't the director know that trimming a film is a good thing), the special effects looked like special effects (can you say green screen?), and Kirstin Dunst is annoying (Oh, I repeated myself!)",1,6,14,4 May 2007
Horrible Bosses," Wears thin after awhile
","I loved the way the movie starts out. Well written at the beginning the movie does a great job of setting up the premise...three bosses that are so morally bankrupt, mean, and bad, that the only recourse is to kill them. With some really funny moments, lines, and situations the movie is quite entertaining. Then it runs dry. The last 30 minutes seems to drag on and the writers gets sloppy. The movie wraps up far to neatly and conveniently.The standout performances in this film belongs to Charlie Day, who gave an excellent comedic performance of a man being sexually harassed, and Jennifer Aniston who performed her part wonderfully as the harasser.",4,5,12,8 July 2011
Interstellar," Too long, too pretentious, too far-fetch
","The movie did not need to be almost three hours long...this was a great example of why it is a bad choice to let a director have the last say over edits, cuts, and length of a film. So many scenes could have been cut.The only interesting part of the film was when the characters finally made it to different planets. However, all the science leading up to the adventure of going to different galaxies seemed to be a lot of mumbo-jumbo...lots of theories and big words to confuse the audience so that we think it could be possible.The last thirty minutes almost was incomprehensible...the explanations of what happened in the earlier part of the film didn't make sense...but because it was explained with a serious voice talking and serious music behind it, people who don't understand quantum physics (which are most of us) will think it does.Plese Hollywood, reign in Christopher Nolen a bit.",2,40,87,11 November 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Boring and hard to swallow
","This film took forever to get started (lots and lots of exposition)and once it does it goes no where. The biggest disappointment was how they utilized the new super-human powers that they gave Captain America. He did nothing more amazing than what Stallone and Schwarzenegger do in their action films. He fought, killed, and outwitted the bad guys no better than any human action star does in movies...what a waste of highly developed muscles. Also, the bad guy looked like he was Jim Carrey from 'The Mask.' Did the director realize that they both looked similar? Finally, the female character was extremely annoying...and it was hard to swallow the idea that the army in the 1940's would ever have a woman train new recruits.",Null,4,13,2 August 2011
Nightcrawler," Basic Premise is Totally False
","The basic premise of this movie that TV stations show video of blood and guts on the local newscasts is totally wrong and not true. Newscasts (at least those here in Los Angeles---where the movie takes place) do not do that. The local stations go out of their way NOT to show it. Thus, the film's story is hard to get into. However, even if one wants to go along for the ride and believe the premise, the movie is slow getting somewhere exciting. It feels that the movie really begins about 90 minutes into it...it gets somewhat exciting...and then it kinda ends with a whimper. At least Jake Gyllenhall does a great job of portraying a crazy person...his weight loss added to his performance",2,32,80,31 October 2014
28 Weeks Later," Shaking the camera is not directing!
","The direction of the movie is extremely pretentious. Most of it is extremely quick cutting (less than a second per cut sometimes) and much of the rest is a camera shaking. Lots of closeups also (what a cliché it is to show only an extreme closeup of an eye with a tear coming out of it!) None of the characters were likable. The two kids were whiny and self-centered. The wife, who was left behind by her husband, was also selfish when she wanted her husband to save her and a strange kid in a situation where they all would have died. Couples who love each other would demand the other get out and away if the situation seemed hopeless. Overall, not a well-thought out movie.",1,6,17,12 May 2007
Disturbia," A Teen Movie!
","This movie is disguising itself as a Hitchcock type of movie when in actuality it is nothing more than a teen movie. The main characters are teens, the main occupation (other than spying on neighbors) are thoughts about the opposite sex, and the humor (what little there is of it) is directly towards teens. The story and the events that result from the plot are many times forced and rather unrealistic. The movie was slow to start (I think it was about 45-60 minutes into the film) before the real plot reveals itself. The acting was nothing special. I cannot emphasize it enough---this is a teen movie---do not see it if you are over 19!!!!",2,16,35,15 April 2007
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Laughable, silly, full of plot holes
","This movie makes those old cheesy sequels of Planet of the Apes (Beneath, Return, Battle etc.) look like masterpieces of writing. So much of the film is unbelievable (and I wanted to believe!) The chimp pound, where they confine Ceasar (the main chimp) is huge with a large area for the chimps to play in(Bob Barker would be proud). No city would ever build such a place. And the chimp pound has literally hundreds of unwanted chimps...REALLY? Could any city afford to keep them? And later when the chimps escape, humans can't control them? Well, maybe because it takes place in San Francisco, the authorities can't carry guns and they are not allowed to shoot them.Anyone who lives in San Francisco must of laughed when they took the chimp for an outing in Muir woods and NOBODY was there. Hey, Muir woods is a big tourist attraction and there are always hundreds of people there.Didn't I see a helicopter blow up in a spectacular fashion, and seconds later it's still in one piece (although slightly damaged).What was that whole thing about man going to Mars...the writers seemed to make a big deal about that and nothing developed from it.And, who are we to root for?. Certainly not the chimps, who seem mean and vengeance driven. I was hoping they would all be eliminated. Certainly not the James Franco character, who endangers the neighborhood by keeping this chimp who seems not to be able to control himself (a neighbor who was just protecting his kids is made out to be a jerk---I would have done the same thing for the safety of my kids).The truly cheesy predictable ending is a real cheat because this movie is then revealed as PART ONE.And please tell the writers to see the original...mankind's demise was not due to a virus killing everyone...it was due to our penchant for war.",1,47,106,5 August 2011
2012," Worst Movie of 2009
",This is indeed the worst movie of 2009. The only thing going for this film is the special effects and even those get tiring after an hour. There is no logic used in this film...everything thing happens just because the director and writer want it to happen. Yellowstone Park is only 8 hours away from Los Angeles...everyone one on the east coast is calm while the entire Pacific coast has met unbelievable disaster...cell phones still work even though most of the world is destroyed...our hero constantly outruns every disaster that is facing him. Nothing is believable in this film. And it is 2 1/2 hours long! There are several subplots that could have easily been deleted from the film to make it 90 minutes. Nothing makes sense in this movie. The director of this movie should never be allowed to make another movie!!!,2,53,101,13 November 2009
Avatar," Another Outer-Space Cowboys and Indians Pix
","At first I was in awe of this movie...the special effects are amazingly real looking. It was fascinating to see another world evolve before my eyes that was filled with fawn and fauna.Then I waited for the story to begin...and that's when the let-down began. The movie is a $250 Million dollar cowboy and Indians picture. The earth mining company (the cowboys) want to kick the planet's inhabitants out (the Indians) so they can rape and pillage the land (the New World). The political agenda was so clear...Americans (or Europeans) are bad and all the natives of the countries they colonized (even if it was for the better) are good. It would have been far better to camouflage this agenda a little so it would not seem like a lecture.I was hoping the ending would justify the rest of the movie...I was wrong there too...it was quite hard to believe that bows, arrows, and animals, would easily, and rather quickly, take down a gargantuan military force",1,43,119,19 December 2009
Mama," Boring and slow
",This is one of those pictures where the previews are far far scarier than the actual movie. Nothing in the film makes to much sense. There seems to be no logical reason for anything to be happening. It turns out to be a very simple ghost story. The middle part of the film is what let the whole production down. For about an hour nothing much happens to advance the story...it is an hour of 'whoops...I see the ghost...whoops it went away' This central hour of the film goes on too long like that. The only good part is the representation of the ghost...they did a pretty good job of imagining her. All the actors are rather forgettable.,2,10,35,18 January 2013
Super 8," Nothing's really explained!
","The movie is quite interesting...for about 30 minutes. Then things fall apart. It slows way down. Strange events happen over and over (and over again!) However, I was still interested in finding out what was really going on and wanted to know the cause of the events. However, the ending is quite contrived and everything that happens to save the day happens quite conveniently. But the real bummer is that nothing's really explained. Just like in Abram's TV series LOST, he doesn't bother to give answers to a whole bunch of questions. However, the worst part of this movie is the last two minutes...it's unbelievably schmaltzy and not worthy for anything but a movie that's intended for six-year-olds.",1,84,153,10 June 2011
Limitless," Narrated film
","This is one of those films that if it wasn't narrated it wouldn't make much sense. Almost everything is explained with voice-over. It becomes very annoying...why is Bradley Cooper's character talking to us...there was no set-up for this. In old movies, the character at least is shown to be in a police station at the beginning of a film and we see him telling a story to the cops.Despite the narration, the film is mildly interesting with it's premise of a drug that makes one super-aware. The picture moves along at a quick pace until 3/4 the way through, where lots of loose ends are tied up a little too neatly and a little too conveniently.",5,1,6,23 March 2011
The Da Vinci Code," Confusing and badly directed
","I did not read the book, so I am not one of those people who compare movies to books. I knew nothing about the book, characters, or story. So I am judging this movie solely on what's on the screen. I found the whole movie difficult to follow and extremely confusing. I lost track of the characters and did not believe the story logic. This is one of Ron Howard's worst directed film. He cut scenes everywhere. If two people were talking, he would cut between them. If someone picked up a glass of water---bamm! closeup of hand picking up water then cut to a closeup of person drinking water.Subtitles were overdone. Sometimes there would be something on the screen we were supposed to pay close attention to, but unfortunately was distracted from because we were supposed to read the subtitles! The actress who played the lead french girl was annoying beyond belief. Her whiny french accent became unbearable.I know this film was fiction, and I am sure most people know that. But I can understand why (and I am not a religious person) the church does not like this film. It unfairly puts the church down with theories that some people might think are based on real theories. I gave this movie a 3 rating but in my heart I would like to give it a 0.",3,0,6,21 May 2006
Inception," Totally Pretentious
","This film thinks it's important. However, the movie says nothing about anything. All the dream stuff is made up by the writer. Nothing is based on real science. There is no explanation of anything other than just to state that things are. For example, there is no explanation on how this whole inception devise was created or how it works. Other examples are the proclamation in the movie that when you die in a dream, you wake up (oh really) Then there is the idea that if you die within a dream that's within a dream you go into 'limbo.' Whaaaaaaaaat! Everything that's required to put forth the story happens too conveniently. People and events happen at the right time just when they are supposed to happen.This is what happens when a movie is written, produced, and directed by the same person. The producer/writer/director doesn't have to worry about anyone telling him their are problems with the script. No checks and balances. The movie becomes very self-indulgent.The music was often so loud that the dialogue was muffled and the convoluted storyline was hard to follow.",1,33,110,17 July 2010
Life," Unintelligible Alien Copy
","Much of the movie is unintelligible...several of the characters are from other countries and speak with accents that at sometimes quite hard to understand...thus, I didn't know what the heck they were doing much of the time and why.The biggest flaw is that it is a remake of Alien, except in a different locale. Even the ending smells of Alien. No new thinking here! Unfortunately, they took the Alien story and made it silly. Smart people doing really dumb things. The only redeeming part of this movie is the beginning shot...a long 5 minutes or so sequence without a visible edit cut...that was amazing.",2,7,16,28 March 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Half-Baked Story Idea
","What the heck was going on with the story in this movie???? It was like it wasn't completely thought out. Was it a horror, science fiction, comedy, or fantasy movie??? It tried to be all of them...thus, is was none of them.After the film was over, I was reminded of LOST, the TV series, and how similar the writing was. As in that TV show, so much was presented in this movie but very little was explained. It was as if they just didn't care if anything made sense or had a reason to be...lots a puzzles but very little answers...lots of interesting ideas with no logic to support them. Afterwards, I discovered this was written by Drew Goddard, one of the LOST writers!In the future I will avoid movies written by Goddard.",2,16,33,15 April 2012
Her," Depressing, pretentious, and over indulgent!
","Depressing...the main character is a major loser...I don't blame people for not wanting to be around him...all of his troubles are his own fault...he is indeed, as one of the characters call him, creepy. Despite the previews, there is nothing funny in this film...it is one of the most depressing films of the year.Pretentious...remember the plastic bag floating in the air in 'American Beauty'? Well, if you like that then there will be several scenes you will absolutely enjoy with this film! Hmmm...staring at oil stains on the ground? Watching steam arise from a manhole cover? They come on as non-sequiturs but I am sure the director was making what he probably considers a great statement.Over-indulgent...2 hours long! There is a scene where 'sex' takes place between he and 'her' and the screen goes black and SILENT for what feels like TWO minutes. It was an awkward moment sitting in the theater with nothing happening on the screen! Also, after about 75 minutes, the ending seems to be in reach but the director drags the story on for another 45 minutes!",1,163,319,12 January 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Waste of money to see it in 3D
","After everything Michael Bay said about how he is embracing 3D, I was really excited to see it in 3D. I had given up on 3D after foolishly seeing Piranha 3D. Thus, I paid the extra $3.50 for the privilege and was enormously disappointed. I had expected to be drawn into all the action and be amazed at the 3D effects...but there weren't any. The movie was strangely flat. What was Michael Bay bragging about???I have, in the past, seen lots of 3D movies...especially the ones made in the 1950's. The smart directors, like Alfred Hitchcock did in 'Dial M for Murder', use the process to enhance the movie experience. With a picture like Transformers 3, (since this movie was not a work of art), the need was there to have things pop out of the screen. After all, it is a pure popcorn picture with explosions, action, and chase scenes).If you want to see this movie (I thought it was too long and too silly) save your money and see it flat.",2,4,12,7 July 2011
