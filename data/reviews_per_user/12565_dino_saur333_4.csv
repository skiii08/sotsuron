Sucker Punch," You'll be fine as long as you leave your brain at the door
","I know a good movie when I see one...This isn't one. But you can't really call it a bad movie. Like much (read: all) of Zack Snyder's work, this movie is best watched with the reasoning part of your head mostly turned off. Just imagine that you're reading a cool comic book and then suddenly that comic decided it wanted to be a full length motion picture. That's essentially how I treated this movie and I believe that's really the only way to fully appreciate this movie.On to the story. From the trailer, you can tell it's about escaping reality into a dream. The thing is that story is about a girl, called Baby Doll, who gets wrongly sent to a mental institution by an evil step-father. In order to escape the horrible reality of being trapped in the asylum, she escapes by imagining a dreamworld...where she is trapped in an illegal strip club / brothel...wait, what?Anyway, while trapped in the brothel she comes up with a plan to escape an recruits a few friends. As they collect the needed items for their escape, she gives herself courage to go through the plan by...imagining herself in other crazy dreamworlds where she and her friends are super soldiers and her enemies are either zombies, cyborgs, mutants, or some strange combination of the former stuff.So in case you missed that, she created dreamworlds to escape the horrible reality of the brothel, which is in itself a dreamworld she created to escape the horrible reality of the asylum...And here is my biggest problem with the movie. Why the double layer of pseudo reality? I thought the story would be fine if they stuck with just brothel world. Or heck it would be also fine if they skip the brothel part and stuck with just being in the asylum. I think the only reason we even have the brothel part was because they needed an excuse to put the main cats in skimpy clothing (or, most likely, because Inception is still an internet meme at this point)So the story kinda goes awry when we start jumping between one reality to another but overall, there is a solid plot that you can figure out if you think hard enough. It was a decent story but the character development was a little lackluster. Also, the word 'acting' has a veeeeeery loose meaning here.But the real appeal of this movie is of course the effects. Are the action sequences as crazy as we saw in the trailer? Yes. In fact what we saw in the trailers are just the tip of the iceberg. in typical Zack Snyder style, the action is intense, filled with complex choreography, cool use of weapons, sweeping camera movement, and the ever popular (read: quite annoying) use of slooooooooowwwwwww mooootioooon.Granted, he does use the slo-mo thing rather tastefully, syncing the action with the movies awesome soundtrack. The slo-mo is bearable here, even appreciated at some scenes. But there was this once scene in the move where I think the slo-mo was pushing it a bit.Credit to the guys who designed all of Baby Doll's dreamworlds though. The set design, both real and imagined, is excellent. Even though the movie is about escaping to non-reality, at least they didn't go totally into silly cartoon realms by removing all semblance of sense. It's like most Japanese anime: Nowhere near realistic, but not so removed from reason that you can't relate to it anymore.Overall, the movie was enjoyable. It had a decent story and cast and the effects in the action scenes were quite entertaining. Not terribly memorable but I'll probably want to pick it up when it comes out on video.",6,2,14,28 March 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Amazing locale with good characters and a good story
","I remember that when I first watched 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series, what really impressed me with that movie was the amazing sets and locales when they filmed it.That feeling is repeated in this movie. The sets and the locations are simply amazing in this movie. If you're gonna praise somebody, big props to the set designers and production team. Just like in POTC they managed to take me to a far off rich fantasy world.If you've played the games, you'll know that the stories are usually straight-forward (In some cases like the Dreamcast version there was no story at all!) and the focus of the games was all about action and running around in a big world full of things that just about anybody can grab/climb/swing/shimmy/jump off of.So my first thought when I heard about this movie was 'How the heck are they gonna come up with a decent story for the script based of the source material?' Wonder of wonders, the writers managed to come up with something pretty engaging...if not totally predictable. Anything with time travel, you know what the hero's gonna do at the end. Time travel solves everything.But I'm getting ahead. The main story deals with the Prince, fallen from grace after being framed for murdering the King, running around all over the middle east to find proof of his innocence. And on his way there's lot's of running, sword-fighting, more running, sneaking around, free-running, and a really hard-to-believe-but-you-still-go-with-it-anyway romantic subplot that appears out of nowhere (It's Disney so you probably saw that coming)And while this is from the producers of POTC, don't expect any over the top character acting like with Jhonny Depp/Jack Sparrow. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a pretty good Prince, though not exactly matching the character from the games. Jake's prince is a lot nicer, which does take away a bit of the Prince's bad-ass aura. Gemma Arterton plays the spoiled princess Tamina rather convincingly. Ben Kingsley's evil uncle Nizam is a note from James Bond book of Villainy but still somehow works for the movie.Some characters I can live without, like Dastan's other brother, Garsiv. I don't know where the film-makers got him from but I felt that this guy was rather inconsistent. It's not the actor's fault though, Toby Kebbell did as good a job as he could do. The character is just badly written in the script and the movie would've been fine without him.Overall, an enjoyable movie that must be seen in the theaters. Fans of the game may find a few things missing from the overall experience but in my opinion the film-makers did a decent enough job. While the story and acting are above-average at best, those visuals were simply meant to be seen on the big screen.",6,1,3,2 June 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Had the same problem as Spiderman 3
","And that problem is way too many characters with way too little development time. If you're a big fan of the comics and a few choice characters you will be slightly disappointed at how little screen-time certain characters get.There were two characters I would've wanted to see more of: Gambit and Deadpool. Both characters have deep backgrounds to them and are both very interesting. However the movie treats them as throwaway characters with each getting less than ten minutes of screen time.And then there's Cyclops. Really? Why bother putting him in the posters if you'll give him such a small part. They practically threw him away in X3 and now they just used him as fodder. Does Hollywood really have that little respect for all the really deep and interesting characters? However, at least I got what I expected most of the movie: a not too complicated but still personal story of Wolverine, kick-ass action scenes, and a tying up of many of the loose ends from the original X-men trilogy. The script and screenplay were very good and the director did a good job putting this movie together.Despite its shortcomings, fans will find something to enjoy here. And if you've seen all the other X-men movies then I recommend you check this out.",7,1,4,4 May 2009
Django Unchained," Probably the best film I've seen in long while
","Every time I see a bad review of this film, they always focus on one thing: The rather liberal use of the n-word throughout the movie. The movie is offensive because of the n-word, they say, as if that alone negates everything that was done well with this movie (and there is a lot done well).Oh look, they use a derogatory term for black people for a movie set in an era where black people were barely considered 'people' in the first place. Oh look, they use a racist term for a movie set in a time when being a racist was pretty much the norm. The movie is bad for that reason alone...Really?OK, I understand that, as a civilization, we are trying to grow up and move away from prejudice, but to condemn an art piece meant to depict a less-developed time because it clashes with your modern morals is, well, immature. Another thing, you act as if the movie directly insults you. At what point was the movie directing its insults at you? Not only are you offended out of context, it's also misdirected! How self-righteous and immature do you have to be to--- You know what, forget it. It's got nothing to do with the movie so it's not worth getting into.What is worth getting into is why this movie is awesome. Considering this movie pushes the 3 hour mark, I'm amazed that it kept my attention through out the whole thing. That says something for the film because I'm one of those kind of guys who can barely keep focused on anything for more than twenty minutes. But here, I found myself intrigued by every single scene and how the story moved forward. So this movie gets an A from me from storytelling merits alone. Dialogue is balanced with exposition and the script, while shoddy in a few places, works well overall. The narrative is very much character-driven which I think is the film's biggest merit. It doesn't rely on big sets or numerous filler montages. The action scenes are short and brutal. And they should be because there's nothing fancy about the shootouts and these scenes are mostly direct to the point and leave a big impact. This ain't no kung-fu movie. The movie is all about the interaction and conflict if it's rather diverse and talented cast. Speaking of whom...Though I think he's the weakest of the main characters, Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz is still a very notable performance, probably one of the best in Waltz's career. I love the way he serves as the wise mentor figure in the story as well as providing most the comic relief. Schultz's cleverness displayed in the film is fun to watch and lends a certain respect to his character. And though he is played to be lighthearted most of the time, there are instances where we definitely see a hidden depth to Schultz. That said, it's also the character's weakness because, you know this guy has a long and likely very interesting history, and yet very little of that history is explored within the narrative. And that sucks. This guy should have his own movie really. But of course the movie is focused on the title character Django (with a silent D) played by Jamie Foxx. This movie is all about Django coming to his own. Foxx handled that splendidly in my opinion. When we're first introduced to the character as a nervous and broken man who seemed lost in just about any environment, portrayed in a way that, strangely enough, reminded me of Forrest Gump somewhat. But as the story progress, Django matures, learns the ropes, gains confidence in himself, takes more risks, and generally grows from being Schultz's student to equal. Foxx's portrayal of this development is commendable. If you watch just the first and last 15 minutes of the movie, you'd think he was playing two completely different characters. Watching the movie is a whole, the gradual transformation of Django from rookie to pro is amazingly subtle though. Foxx's excellent performance makes sure that Django's development doesn't come off as forced or contrived and is believable throughout. But my favorite character would be, hands down, Calvin Candie played by Leonardo DiCaprio whose performance is, in a word, sublime. Candie simply eats up any scene he's in. Even if you wanted to, you simply cannot deny his presence. And while he starts off as a non-too-serious antagonist when first introduced, we quickly realize that this is a man that one does not want to hang out with on a social basis. But that realization happens without the guy being overly diabolical about it, which lends to the believability of the character. And when Candie eventually does go off the chain he easily becomes the most memorable villain in film history. Much respect to Waltz but how DiCaprio did not get more Best Supporting Role award nominations (especially at the Oscars) is beyond me. I don't have much to say about Samuel L. Jackson's character, Stephen, as he really only serves as a plot point that leads into the climax of the movie. Many people don't like it when you get a big name to play what is essentially a throw-away character. But I'm fine with it. For what little screen time he had, Jackson gave an excellent enough performance to be memorable.So basically, yeah, awesome direction, awesome script, awesome characters played by awesome actors makes for a definite hall-of-famer in my opinion. This film will stay with me for a long time. It's a brutal, bloody, brilliant take on the darker parts of America's history not without its fair share of humor and wit. A must see film for anyone with any measurable appreciation for good cinema.",10,5,13,17 March 2013
