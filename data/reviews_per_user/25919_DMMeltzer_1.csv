Walk the Line," Fudging With the Facts?
","The best biopic in recent years, one of the best overall. But as with most I detected two anachronisms. The movie shows Johnny and June in Las Vegas clearly identified as 1965 singing Jackson, yet according to my memory (and more important, the liner notes on the Johnny Cash Legend CD), they did the song in 1967. And shortly thereafter, the movie shows June trying to write Ring of Fire. Well it is true that she did write it for him, but he recorded it in 1963. I also need to do my research because I have no idea if the proposal scene (no spoiler here...it's common knowledge he marries her), occurs as it did in the movie or if that was literary license.",10,0,2,25 November 2005
