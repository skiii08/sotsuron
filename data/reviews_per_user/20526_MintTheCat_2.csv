Howl's Moving Castle," A lovely film for new and old fans
","'Howl's moving castle' is indeed a loose adaption of the novel by Dianna Wyn Jones. I've seen pretty much most of Miyazaki's more famous and also less known works, compared to Spirited Away, this movie does lack something, probably the charm and soul, I'm not quite sure. None the less, it is a lovely film. Each character is well voiced and well personified through the animation, such as Howl himself whose vain nature and cowardly reputation cover a more charming, more darker persona that is unveiled by Sophie. When the curse is placed on Sophie, I found she was a more likable character, as the older version had a much richer sense of humour and lovable attitude. Calcifer is definitely a show stealer, as Billy Crystal's voice is much suited for the fire demon, he is much of the humour that can be found in this film, along with Turniphead who still stands as my favourite character in the whole film. The story does flow nicely, but the dub may have lost some of the general plot as it can be all over the place at times, and reading the novel doesn't always fill in the blank spaces. That is most likely where the film falls due to such a long winding confusing plot, but nevertheless!Howl's Moving Castle is worth the watch, just because of the charm it has.",8,1,2,21 May 2006
Spirited Away," The most beautiful anime to grace this world
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED I'm an avid fan of the anime world, and I'm still a teenager.I've grown up with all forms of anime, from the badly done pokemon to the more acceptable X. But Miyazaki's works have captured my soul constantly.I first saw Princess Mononoke when I was searching for a good film, my mum bought it for me and I watched it. I was instantly in love. This brand of anime was unreal, it moved with a fluidity unlike anything I've seen before.Spirited Away is the story of a young 10 year old girl called Chihiro who is moving house with her parents. They get lost and find an empty 'theme park' which is really the land of spirits. Upon her parents receiving their punishment, Chihiro gets trapped in the spirit world but is saved from fading away by a strange boy called Haku. The story unfolds as Chihiro faces her fears and faces Yubaba, The staff of the bath house and the demon, No Face.My personal favorite parts are the battle against No Face as Chihiro fights off by simply using a medicene she was given and teaching him the importance of friendship. Also, revealing who Haku really is and showing such loyalty to someone.The moral of this story is that sometimes, you need to mature and learn that you can't rely on someone else to save you. You must also cherish your friends and keep loyal to the end. At least that's it to me None the less, it's a fantastic animation with beautiful music, charming characters, a storyline that sucks you in and animation quality beyond possibility.Who needs 3D these days? ^_^",10,1,2,13 September 2005
