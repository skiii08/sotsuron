Come and See," come and really see...
","This movie is frightening in a way that audiences don't get to see much of anymore. A boy thrust into smaller WWII battles after literally being a child the day before. This movie, as stated in a film class I recently took, should be seen by any and all people considering joining the military. The boy, joins the movement against Hitler and is thrown on a few day journey in which he ages grossly. The scenes are frightening as is the landscape which is at times scarier than the battle scenes which is partly what makes this film so unique. It is the sound effects as well as the locations and the scenery. The movie shows great and brilliant taste at times as well, like at the end where the boy shoots a pictures of Hitler repeatedly instead of partaking fully in killing captured Nazis.",8,2,3,20 December 2008
