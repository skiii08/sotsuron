The Blair Witch Project," Uh
","This movie is just insane, why would they do something fictitious, I mean get real people, seriously this movie just didn't had the necessary quality, there was not even a chilling moment! I always thought this movie, did had something scary you know, like when they hear Josh screaming up stairs, they go there and they here Josh downstairs now. That maybe okay. But the bloody handprints were just crap in ANY horror movie (bad, good) It may always show bloody handprints, if they wanted to do something new, why did they do that I mean COME ONE! And what about at the end when she drops her camera or when she losts the map goshh really people get your head in better stuff I wasted 1 freaking hour of my life!",1,7,11,1 July 2008
