The Blair Witch Project," Spooky!
","A really good horror flick! The best way to watch it is around midnight with all the lights off! Really gets your imagination running! A great use of no-name actors and the different types of film used was ingenious! My wife, without hearing about the 'mockumentary', actually thought that it was real footage found.",9,1,2,2 June 2002
