Men in Black 3," Very boring and nowhere near funny enough.
",Didn't enjoy this one bit. Very middle of the road with not enough aliens and effects in it for my liking very dull I couldn't even begin to imagine what the 3d version must've played out like there weren't many scenes that I thought 3d would come into play. Give this a miss and wait for the DVD - waste of time and money 1 out of 10. I think men in blacks time has ran its coarse. Will smith wasn't stretched at all in this film he is a lot more talented than what this film allows and he should turn down any follow up to this franchise even though he won't ! Probably should have gone seen Prometheus instead. This is as far away from men in black 1 as you can get. Rubbish.,1,15,33,20 June 2012
