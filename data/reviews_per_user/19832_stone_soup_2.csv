Black Swan," Layered story, stunning ending
","I love the layers of meaning and the openness of the story that really gives the viewer much to think about at the end of the movie, as well as giving room for many different interpretations of what was real and what was not real.The middle of the movie stumbled a bit as we slowly see some manifestations of the Black Swan, but the ending is stunning, not just by virtue of the great soundtrack, but Nina's dramatic transformation, which I will not elaborate on further.I felt afraid of, afraid for, and sad for Nina by the end of the movie. The directing was not fantastic, but Darren Aronofsky's vision for this film is frightening and eye-opening. Natalie Portman has really exceeded and pushed herself in this film. Worth watching just for her acting.",9,1,3,16 February 2011
Million Dollar Baby," Simply perfect.
","I admit, I have not seen any Clint Eastwood or Hilary Swank movies before. Before watching this movie, I never understood all the hype and awards surrounding this movie. However, after watching it, I have to give credit to Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood for putting up such great performances.The story is a very compelling one, with characters who are both yearning for success. The enthusiasm and eagerness to learn of Maggie reflects the tough life she has led and the difficulties she has gone through. The way her family treats her is heartbreaking. It seems that she puts out all her frustrations in the ring.The relationship Maggie and Frankie have can be likened to a father-daughter relationship. The lack of any contact Frankie has with his daughter Katie constantly nags at him every time, and he has grown to love Maggie not just as his apprentice, but also as his daughter and he is determined to hold on to her.This movie not only has a compelling story and complex personalities, it also has a very thought-provoking ending. It makes you ponder about your relationship with your own father, especially if you are a female. Frankie finally finds the courage in himself but who knows what burdens he carries?",9,1,1,6 November 2005
