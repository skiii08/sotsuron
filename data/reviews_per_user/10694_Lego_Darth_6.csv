Lucky Number Slevin," Awesome flick!
","Holy God, what an amazing movie. A great modern-noirish movie that was cast perfectly and cheesy enough to make you never take it that serious. I mean come on, The Rabbi as the co-villain, that's hilarious. The movie almost never takes itself seriously until people start to die and that's when it should be serious. See it! Stop whatever it is you're doing and go watch it. The casting, as previously mentioned, was perfect. No one seems type cast and everyone brings something incredible to the role. Never before has a movie kept me quite on my toes like Slevin did. I honestly couldn't tell what was going to happen next. The big twist, sadly, was pretty easy to spot from the beginning, but otherwise I was clueless and lovin' every minute of it. The dialogue is perhaps the best part. Sitting there listening to endless witty banter is sheerly enjoyable, no doubt about it. Never ever doubt the beauty of this movies words. Excellent!",8,0,5,20 August 2006
X-Men," Cool, cool, cool
","This movie is the achievement all comicbook movies should look up to. The casting is perfect. None of the performances are forced or cheesy. Every character is treated respectfully by Singer and their respective actor. Hugh Jackman brings a unique and different aspect to the character of Wolverine, but he still holds true to the original essence of the character. Certain aspects could use touch-ups. Halle Berry's wig just makes her character comical and distracts from what was a good performance. And, the story leaves Cyclops, Scott Summers, out in the dust as far as things to do. As the leader of the team his role needed to be bigger. More action and drama. Length and timing are perfect and the writing is to die for in this film. Despite its length, only an hour and forty some minutes, everything is taken to its conclusion without rushing. Singer brought the X-Men to film in the best way possible. Kudos.",9,0,1,15 August 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Nothing special
","Little Miss Sunshine was trying to be something it wasn't. It tried to be the amazing feel good dark comedy of the summer, however it just came off average. The problem isn't anyone thing, it just seems to have holes. There are truly beautiful moments, followed by really awkward moments. The acting is wonderful, but there doesn't seem to be an arc for any character; no one seems to progress at all. Steve Correll's(sorry for misspellings) character didn't slowly become less suicidal over the course of the plot, and Greg Kinnear's character seemed to become even more idiotic as time went on. The death of the grandfather and the bringing him along was taken straight from National Lampoon's Vacation, however, it was handled much differently, more serious. The only real character progression was in the character of Dwayne. His story was by far the most well put together. Yet, the setup in the beginning left you ready for a great ride. And, the acting was superb. There isn't any reason not to see this movie. Just don't get your hopes up. Come in with low expectations and you may be surprised.",7,57,101,2 September 2006
Spider-Man," A quieter comic book adaptation
","What makes this movie special is the personal touch. There is no big 'let's destroy the world' plot, it's just a grudge match between two polar opposites with superpowers. Willem Dafoe gives a brilliant and creepy performance as the Green Goblin, really the best villain in the Spiderman comics, and Tobey Macguire knocks it out of the ball park, pardon the pun, with his performance as Peter Parker. Really, this movie isn't about solving some global crisis, like in Singer's X-Men flicks, but is about simply doing the right thing. That's what gives this movie such a great feeling. People don't really remember the springy high-flying fun of the webslinging so much as the personal story. And, one especially interesting aspect of this film is the almost invisible direction and cinematography. Sam Raemi has an invisible direction style that makes everything seem more real as opposed to staged. The cinematography never calls attention to itself so you're never left feeling detached from the story or characters. It, Spiderman, is an impressive and singularly brilliant achievement.",9,0,1,22 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Just doesn't hold up
","Sorry, but the third X-Film just isn't as good as the first two. But, that doesn't mean that it isn' t good. Ratner's spin on the X-Men is more CG driven than character driven, but he still provides good plot in a fast-paced style that's not horrible, just different. However, the sub-plots overtake the main story and ruin what would have been decent pacing. The Kitty Pride story is a good subplot that provides a good arc for both Iceman and Rogue. However, some emotional sidelines never feel quite completed or adequately put together. The death of Xavier would have been great had the funeral scene been thrown away. It didn't have the emotional gravitas that would have been needed to make it worth the time. Also, the death of Cyclops was just simply pushed aside by plot. However, Ratner succeeded in bringing an excellent climax worthy of a much better film. Logan's near sacrifice to 'save' Jean is gripping and moving. He, Ratner, moved the trilogy in a different direction but in the end he held true to Singer's vision. You can feel Logan's pain and Jean's relief as she dies. It is beautiful. I think this film has been unfairly cast into the pit of bad. It deserves more respect. Ratner just isn't as good a director as Singer; our expectations were dashed was all. The bar was set high, sadly, higher than Ratner could reach is all. It is definitely worth watching.",8,0,1,15 August 2006
X2: X-Men United," Flawless
","Perfect. That's all there is to it. Better than the first by leaps and bounds, indeed! Singer brings the same care to staying true to the characters and ups the stakes by making more action to replace all the heavy exposition of the first film. The plot is more just an excuse to comment on social problems and to develop Logan's mystery. Yet, it still makes sense and is well thought out. However, the true heart of this film is in the characters. *Spoiler* By far, the best scene as far as acting and character driven drama is the moment after Jean's death when Logan hold Scott and says 'She's gone.' Scott's response is the thing that sells Jean's death. 'No, you don't say that!' It is by far the best performance in that movie. Bravo, James Marsden, and bravo Singer for bringing this movie to the people.",9,0,0,15 August 2006
