Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Read the novel first
","Even though I did read the novel first, it still took me a few minutes to get the gist of what was going on, as scenes moved with perhaps too quick of a pace. I feel anyone seeing this film before reading the novel beforehand may become a bit confused. A few negatives for me was that this film reminded me too much of 'Van Helsing'(2004), with too much special effects and little else; also, the ending was different and less effective that the superior novel's ending. Lastly, there's no John Wilkes Booth to be found at all, and that was the biggest disappointment, as his final meeting with Henry(novel)is a great moment, but it was foolishly ignored in the film. All of that being said, this was an entertaining film, with decent performances, especially by Dominic Cooper(Henry), and Rufus Sewell(Adam), and I also liked some of the vampire transformations. I wished there were more scenes with Henry, a 'good' vampire, if you will, and some mention of Booth, as I stated above. If you think this is a film you want to watch, I would highly recommend reading the novel first, as it's an easy read, and you may learn things about the great Abraham Lincoln that you never knew about, as I did.",Null,0,0,14 September 2018
Donnie Brasco," Very good, but some flaws too
","This slightly different mafia film has several familiar faces, including Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, and Anne Heche, with Pacino giving the best performance as the down-on-his-luck mobster Lefty Ruggiero, who is responsible for introducing Agent Joe Pistone(Depp)into the mob. The best moments were the interactions between the 2 great actors, Pacino and Depp, as they were both very believable in their roles. I thought they both followed the factual book by author Pistone rather well. On the other hand, I felt that Sonny Black's character(Madsen)could've been developed a bit more than just a secondary character; in the book, he's just as important as Lefty, maybe more than that. Without spoiling too much, the ending of the book is very different than the film's convenient ending, in regards to Lefty and Sonny's fate. I got slightly bored when Pistone had arguments with his wife Maggie, played by Heche, as it slowed the film down. Other than those aspects I just mentioned, I still find this a very solid mafia film, but not a great one.",Null,0,1,15 October 2015
Caddyshack," Still funny
","I make it an annual rite of summer passage to watch Caddyshack, either on DVD or the Golf Channel, as it's been an important film to me and my friends growing up as a teen in the 1980's. We would quote many classic lines, especially when playing miniature golf during those summer days back then. You know the story and cast by now, but let me add that I feel that both Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield's chemistry make this film a legendary comedy, and their scenes together are priceless and hilarious. I also liked the chemistry between Ty Webb and Danny Noonan, as they both seem to understand each other's motives. Bill and Brian Doyle Murray have funny moments too at Bushwood Country Club, as the slobs battle the snobs once again.",Null,1,2,23 August 2010
Jaws," still great and relevant
","As most know by now, Jaws is an excellent film about our favorite great white shark terrorizing poor Amity and the locals. The main characters are unforgettable, especially Chief Brody, Matt Hooper, and Quint and most of the top notch dialogue is terrific. Naturally, the most memorable lines revolve around Quint's legendary story about how they 'delivered the bomb' considering how many of the men were killed by sharks. Anyway, the real star of Jaws is Bruce the shark, and how Spielberg keeps it hidden from us before we see the actual beast. This is better than any silly CGI knock off could be considering this is from the summer of 1975. This is one of movies, like Goodfellas, that I make sure to catch at least a few times per year, no matter the season. It never bores me, thanks to perfect and flawless film-making and legendary performances, scenes, and atmosphere throughout.",Null,3,7,25 May 2010
All the President's Men," very good for the most part...until the ending
","Let me first say that I wasn't old enough to remember the Watergate scandal, or anything about Richard Nixon, only what Archie Bunker said about Nixon in an All in the Family episode. He said 'a little bugging', to which the meathead blew a gasket, but I digress. I was very impressed with the acting talents of Dustin Hoffman, who looked like he walked right off the Marathon Man set, and Robert Redford, but especially Hoffman's performance as Bernstein. His edginess worked for this reviewer, as he did everything to get answers to his questions for the most part. Jason Robards, Hal Holbrook, and Jack Warden were also solid here as well. I enjoyed how the 2 columnists pieced mostly everything together, even if it got a tad confusing at times with all the names bandied about. I feel the need to say that I was slightly disappointed with the conclusion, and I expected more than just words on a typewriter telling me who got in trouble and for how long. I wasn't expecting fireworks, but I wasn't totally satisfied.",Null,1,1,10 January 2011
