Hereditary," Don't waste your time
","This movie was traaaash. I hardly ever write reviews on here but I needed to get this off my chest since so many people think highly of this film. Throughout the film you hardly understand what is going on as there is no direction in the plot whatsoever. There was also a huge number of things that did not make sense at all, and while you try to piece together the puzzle you start to realize that this movie isn't scary at all. On top of that they touch on themes that have already been used in better, more coherent horror movies. Add in some atrocious acting by the kids and an overrated performance by Toni Collette and you get a perfect recipe for disaster. Some of the scenes were actually pretty funny because of how God awful they executed them. The writing was also comparable to an elementary student's. Terrible job all the way through, don't understand all the good reviews.",1,7,17,22 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This is the end for you, Star Wars.
","Wow. I never thought I'd see the day when this franchise is ruined. Shame on you, Rian Johnson.The Last Jedi is not only the worst Star Wars movie, it is one of the worst movies of 2017, maybe ever. The whole thing was just a jumbled mess of clich√©s, plot holes, and just plain awful acting. The writing was all over the place, introducing new characters and concepts that did not need to be there at all. TLJ also contained some of the most cringeworthy scenes I have witnessed in cinema, mainly due to the fact that every character was trying to be a comedian and failing in the process. 
This movie did not seem like a continuation of the Force Awakens, but a completely separate and dumbed down take of the Star Wars universe. The original trilogy had it all: terrific acting, well-written scripts, dry humor, and outstanding cinematography. The orignal storyline was also clear and to the point with no need for nonsense in between. I now fully realize that Disney has taken the reins and is trying to appeal to a younger audience with no-substance , 'flashy' crap that kids just eat up. The Star Wars saga ended at Return of the Jedi for me.How this movie received 8 stars is beyond me.",1,2,2,18 December 2017
