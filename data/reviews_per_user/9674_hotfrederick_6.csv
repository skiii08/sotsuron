","To all those that like the film, I agree completely. Really well done. I picked just because I like Jake as an actor. He tries hard, never takes it for granted. Add Michelle Monaghan, so underrated and still gorgeous, and it turned out even better.It's great that syntax of time was not adhered to as relevant, that the story, however small, changes. And to end the way it did, not the alter-reality, but to make everyone laugh ... that is awesome. And the music works here best. Music matters a lot, and I found the dramatic unwarranted. The story had more depth than that, but just at that point, at about the 1:18:15 mark, with all that laughing. This is really beautiful. The alter-reality music is OK, but the rest, unfortunately, is pretty unremarkable. Shame. Still, a great, well-executed story. I read somewhere that Jake was over-acting. Seriously, what would you be doing if you were on a train and the last thing you remember was trying to fly a helicopter? He did a good job. And Vera Farmiga was good, too. It's tough to be human in the military.Fine job.",Null,0,1,9 October 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Hollywood stories never change ...
","To the person who said the CG sucks, you were watching the unfinished film.Still, as much as I love the Wolverine character, the usual nemeses, brother betrayal, etc, is getting long in the tooth. The story is weak. Why spend so much money on building an indestructible man, and then 'chop his head off'? And even the second after it's finished? Melodramatic delirium for nothing.Why should the brother kill W's girlfriend? Why not be a man and cut to the chase, and why not show that such an act is cowardice? If the brother wants to be strong, then doing banal rubbish like that is stupid. Why doesn't it hurt W every time his blades are released anymore. Now he does it for an amusement trick instead of the unbearable pain he went through before.Reviewers say it is more human, but really, it looks more plastic to me. Just going through the motions of fear and friendship. Only Liev kind of got it. He's a big dude that acts like he doesn't need support, but he has the military behind him to act like a big shot with a purpose. Very boring.I don't see the strength in these characters. You want animal? You stab that Asian shooter and look at his eyes die, giving in to the weakness of rage, not recreate an explosion like the end of Mad Max and think you are cool.Considering the cliffhangers they want to throw at the audience, it would have been better to let the cat out of the bag early and really push the depth of the characters for wanting to do that. and save any cliffhanger (if they need it) at the end. In essence, all these mutants are people, too. All have different beliefs, all are pretty lonely. That's human. Work it amongst military idiots, made all the more idiotic by saying one thing and the next in five minutes. Work that. Even the beginning is wrong, showing these guys toughness by glorifying war. War guys are tough, but what a waste of energy.The torture between W's integrity and pain makes us identify with the character. Now he has become just one guy tossed around with others in a salad. Which part should I eat next?",5,4,10,30 April 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," No good
","Na. Did not do it for me. Weak relationships. Usual weakly presented girl gets strong, usual idiot male fiancé, more than usual idiot villain with flaws not developed. Just weak everywhere. I think Dreamworks do some OK stuff, but this is not one of them.What I do think they got right was Susan's outfit. Awesome textile design. Someone should make that for real. Anyone know if something like that exists anywhere? I'd want to buy one for my girlfriend.Did the scriptwriter(s) of this also write WALLE? Similar weaknesses. But WALLE was a bit better.",2,6,13,20 July 2009
Quantum of Solace," Well, lots of people might not like it, but ...
","I thought it was great. I am happy it is not a typical Bond. I see a director who is fleshing out a character, hence the quiet bits, with great music. I like the fact that the villain is different; who said they have to confirm to the usual mad hats that are in previous bonds? Yes, Greene is not like the genius ruse in Casino Royale, but it is in context with the how appallingly we are treating this world, and all the short-sighted people going along with it. I like the fact that Bond did not destroy an Aston Martin to oblivion after driving it for 30 seconds, and that the rest of the cars are beat up or electric, and that a great car does not make a character. Fields is great (fantastic voice), but what I love the most, after all that, is how Matthis and his girlfriend/wife speak Italian. It is because it can be spoken in such a tone and yet with strength that makes it one of the best languages in the world, and why women love it so much. :)",7,1,4,19 December 2008
Moon," Does anyone think that ....
","... the clones only last 2 weeks? If he thinks he is going home in 2 weeks, then has a n accident which he wakes up from, the new clone has to think he is leaving in 2 weeks, too.I am not sure if this has occurred to anyone, but I do see that if they have so, so many clones, and it takes a ship from earth less a than a day to arrive, then they must have an idea of the shortness of life of these clones. The energy to sustain clones in limbo would not be cheap (although, they are making their own energy). So I suspect that there must be an idea that the clones do not last 3 years.Also, how could long range comms be out for 3 years!? Would not make sense to a 3 year clone, but would to a 2 week one.What do you think?",10,1,4,21 February 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Really good, and tragic
","Hi,I have been reading the good and bad reviews of this. I hope this might appease the people, especially Indians, who found it insulting to your culture.I want you to know that I, and I am sure many others, will not assume that the 'slums' could sway people to assume that this is the general picture of India, and not be different to many other countries with poverty issues. All countries, however varying, have their slums and wealth, have stupid people bent on power trips, be it with money or with religion. Please, do not think that one commercial film can depict a country in a lesser state than others. I read someone here write that the Chinese would never allow such a film to be released about their country. I lived in China for almost 3 years, and I believe me, in general, the power trippers there have a lot to learn, no less from India. I have never seen so many people live in poverty, and still do their best to be strong in a culture that treats its people so badly. Anyway, this is my opinion, but I have seen it first hand. I did not live in a hotel and avoid it while I was there. I will not go back to China because of it, regardless of what financial advantages I could achieve to live there.I can tell you that, to me, this movie really brought the Bollywood style palatable to the Western viewer. It made my initial aversion of going to India become one of fascination. I have man friends who love India (I can't remember none who disliked it), where reviews of visits to China are mixed. I love the colour, love the determination of these children, and that Jamal overcomes whatever befalls him to be a confident man who gets the girl. I found his and Latika's energy really strong, particularly in the end, and the dance sequences. Above all the tragedies (please do not say they do not exist, as they do in all countries), there is this amazing joy. I see that in the India depicted in the film, above all else.I can't watch again the scenes of horrible people exploiting children (appalling in any culture) , but do enjoy Jamal's tête-à-tête and his not being intimidated by the WWTBAM host. Some people are born with such traits; Jamal could be one. Anyway, I love the film. Very cool. And, like the genius Chinese women I have met, the Indians show just as much distinction.Really, do not be offended. It's really good.",8,1,3,18 January 2009
