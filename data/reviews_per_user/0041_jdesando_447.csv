Ford v Ferrari," My fav of all time, NOW!
","'It isn't about speed.' Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal).Just as that statement from the world-class car designer is a poignant reminder of the complexity in car racing of the mid '6o's, so too is it about the newest car-racing thriller, Ford V Ferrari. The film combines some of the best racing ever seen on screen with the best of buddy adventures.It is now my favorite (I previously favored Steve McQueen's Le Mans), reminding me of a great Western mixed with a great duo, such as Paul Newman and Robert Redford from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. There's even a scene of the two heroes facing off the suits like a Western gunfight about to happen.Matt Damon as Shelby is at his best cajoling Christian Bale, consummate actor, as legendary driver Ken Miles. Together they fight and joke accompanying their goal of beating the Ferrari juggernaut at the 24 hour Le Mans of 1966.With Tracy Letts playing an imperious but insightful Henry Ford II ('This isn't the first time Ford Motors' gone to war. We know how to do more than push papers. Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.'), the cast is incomparable, forwarding the suspense inherent in the testy cars and power races behind investors and manufacturers. Director James Mangold and the successful writing team keep the 2/12 hours moving thrillingly with a consistent sense of humor and manic competition between Italy and the US and driver versus driver.Ford V Ferrari is the best character-driven action of the year and my favorite race car film of all time.'We're lighter, we're faster, and if that don't work, we're nastier.' ShelbyIf that doesn't sound like a snarly, character-driven Western, then you've never seen The Magnificent Seven.",Null,3,6,18 November 2019
The King's Speech," A Royal Treat
","You heard it from me: Not even James Franco with his boffo performance in 127 Hours can beat Colin Firth for the Oscar in King's Speech, a docudrama about the Duke of York (Firth) becoming King George VI while overcoming a crushing stutter. Not only does the actor get pitch perfect the stutter, but he also invests a kindness, courage, and vulnerability in the character that work in harmony to create an unforgettable George in an exquisite period peace.Not to forget how generously Geoffrey Rush underplays Lionel, the speech therapist who is instrumental in making the king a speaker and a friend. That low-key acting allows Firth the room to expand his king's personality without interference from an Oscar-winning co-star. This is history as I like to learn it—honest and engaging with palaces and minor characters well-appointed and underplayed themselves as part of a mosaic of challenges facing a handicapped king and a nation on the brink of WWII. The pace is close to languid, better to allow us to settle in for the painful transformation of a man unused to public speaking but used to family mocking his disability.George's bravery is the film's heartbeat, not flamboyant courage, mind you, but rather the kind that wakes us up to the character as complex and lovable. But valor is not his exclusively, Guy Pearce's Edward, who abdicates for his love, Wallace Simpson, can be seen as a courageous man giving up a crown for love or a fool falling for a twice-divorced socialite.Such an ambivalence is fitting for a film that gently introduces you to a period in British history when alliances are not clear and allegiances dangerous. One thing is patently clear, however—this is going to be on most critics' best film of the year list with a sure Oscar winner for its star. If Firth missed the brass ring last year in A Single Man, he'll grab it this year in King's Speech.",Null,137,161,17 December 2010
Despicable Me 2," Knocking the Lone Ranger's hat clean off.
","'But the real gift of this little animation gem is homely Gru, the world's best villain but financially least productive. His plan to steal the moon is about the cleverest comment on how much we have stolen, innocence among the treasures; the moon is all we have left to lose. But there is also something else to be stolen—Gru's heart—and that's easily filched by Agnes, Margo, and Edith, orphans selling the equivalent of girl scout cookies but sub textually a heart for a villain who doesn't know yet it's a loving parent's.'Those were my words 3 years ago about Despicable Me, and I stand by them for this year's Despicable Me 2 with one change: Gru's (voice of Steve Carell) heart is to be stolen again, this time by the Anti-Villain League's techno titan, big-nosed Lucy. Having proved herself a formidable agent, she joins Gru's new mission to stop super villain, El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), before his diabolical, out-sized magnet sucks up the entire earth.There's a reason this animation is knocking off the Lone-Ranger's ten-gallon hat this summer: Despicable is lovable: a genuine heart beats in all its characters, from cute-as-hell near-sighted, yellow Minions to the new villain, whose Latino heart beats strong, if for the wrong reasons. Somehow the slightly fey Ranger and the ambiguous Indian cannot capture the same romance. Gru is the unlikely hero once again, a model of rehabilitation who could prepare the younger generation for the myriad comebacks such as Eliot Spitzer, Mark Sanford, and Anthony Weiner:Gru: Yes, I have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world. Edith: You're gonna be a spy? Gru: *That's* right, baby! Gru's back in the game with gadgets and weapons and cool cars! His date with a big-lipped valley girl is disastrous enough to make any single male move into a monastery. That's the kind of humanity until recently Pixar mostly owned.Americans love comeback kids, e.g., Bill Clinton; no place better to be prepared for those changes of heart than Universal's challenge to Pixar's barn full of humanity, the Despicables.",Null,1,2,10 July 2013
The Lobster," Not as absurd as you might think.
","'Because lobsters live for over one hundred years, are blue-blooded like aristocrats, and stay fertile all their lives. I also like the sea very much.' David (Colin Farrell) The dating game is alive and well but this time in a surrealistic romantic comedy, The Lobster. Filmed in Ireland, but probably meant to represent Europe in its current hot mess, this enjoyable magical-realist romance satirically and figuratively features the complex challenges facing anyone dating in the modern age and anyone hoping to assert a unique personality in a time that homogenizes rather than individualizes.David is attending a spa specializing in his finding a suitable mate or turning him into the animal of his choice if he doesn't find a mate in 45 days. David chooses the lobster also because, besides the admirable life expectancy and fertility, it has the reputation for fidelity, albeit serially monogamistic.The fascinating narrative is filled with juicy eccentrics identified by their 'defining trait' (e.g., 'Lisping Man'—played by John C. Reilly), a nod to the online shortcuts of match making in a harrowing search for love that too often ends up in the figurative animal kingdom. Writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos can satirize boilerplate screen writing manuals at the same time.The strict adherence to a couples-only society may appeal to extreme social conservatives today, but it is fraught with frustration for the average sophisticated citizen.David's discovery of the 'Short-Sighted Woman' (Rachel Weisz) offers hope in a world where 'loners' are hunted in the forest and tranquilized. Falling in love, the two go through various plans eventually to liberate them from the strictures of both the hotel and the free-spirited loners in the forest.Unfortunately, a very Greek tragedy-like outcome affects their eye sights possibly to emphasize the blind nature of love and its violent possibilities. Fortunately, Farrell and Weisz deadpan through the vicissitudes of rebellious love, allowing us to concentrate on how desensitizing the forced decorum of contemporary romance can become.'If you encounter any problems you cannot resolve yourselves, you will be assigned children, that usually helps.'

Moneyball," On the Money
","Here's an enjoyable sports film with history behind it and heart inside it. The facts: Under the general management of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) the Oakland A's achieved a phenomenal 20 game winning streak in the early part of this century. The cost: less than two thirds the expenditure of the Yankees. The real cost: players let go and Bean ridiculed, until his winning streak, which changed baseball forever. Moneyball's heart is in Brad Pitt's gentle performance, the best of his career depicting Beane's cool assurance relying on the statistics that have always been available, rather than the guesses of his scouts. A major part of the success is the data-mining mind of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a 25 year old Yale economics grad with a statistical approach that predicts the strength of players who have been marginalized or let go by other clubs. Sabermetrics is his creation, a strategy that builds on player strengths ignored by supposed experts.Unlike most other sports films, even the storied Any Given Sunday, Moneyball delivers organically, just a slow series of setbacks that are nonetheless essential to eventual success. Although we know the outcome, director Bennett Miller strategically paces the early struggles to make you care about the characters, even the negatively traditional coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Where some other films may surpass Moneyball is their showing the reasons on the field for the team's success, whereas here only some locker room chat and brief counseling can be seen as contributory.Like other sports films as well, the middle sags like Art's belly until the winning streak naturally enlivens the somber mood during the losses. Yet the film is exemplary in its feisty meetings as scouts square off against general manager Beane, who is slowly challenging their philosophies of status quo and intuition. On that note is the real strength of a film that exalts both creative thinking and mathematical accounting. Yet never is any of this change made easy",Null,2,3,23 September 2011
Whip It," Not Raquel but entertaining anyway.
","Ellen Page is not Raquel Welch, but they both have played heroines of roller derby films, the former in the current Whip It and the latter in Kansas City Bomber (1972). Besides the obvious differences in bust line, the two characters are ages apart in age and maturity, Welch's K.C. Carr has two kids to worry about, Page's Bliss has two conventional parents and the boredom of Bodeen (Texas, that is) to escape.Whip It is a modest tale of a young girl who finds salvation in nearby Austin's women's roller derby. The script is a running cliché from the shy girl becoming formidable to the aggressive girl growing up. So what new director Drew Barrymore brings to this enjoyable little dramady is the fun the Hurl Scouts girls have in their friendships and games, even in their enemies (what's not to enjoy with a 40 something Juliette Lewis hamming up the part of 'Iron Maiden').While Barrymore's camera doesn't provide much subtle analysis of the action, it does offer close-ups that help define the many interesting, but usually underdeveloped, characters. As for lead Ellen Page, now there's an actress with a future. Although this role hardly offers the edgy dialogue of Juno or gritty suspense of Hard Candy, she nonetheless makes this roller romp worth seeing.Although the roller girls sitting next to me at the preview weren't half as glam as the actresses on the screen, I would have liked to hang out with those amateurs because they have the same energy and fun projected on the screen and an additionally tender je ne sais quoi that complements their toughness. Oh, well, I am a hopeless romantic on wheels.If you have a daughter who needs to find a way to channel her rebellion, you would not do half bad by letting her join the derby or at least see Whip It, where women and girls hold the story better than most of the boy-men I have seen this year on the screen.",Null,2,7,30 September 2009
The Avengers," Outstanding Sci-Fi
","'There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could.' Nick FuryWith all the blasts and bullets of The Avengers, there's enough humanity and humor to win over even this jaded film critic. Although I'm tired of American cinema's pervasive graphics and violence, six heroes saving the world from an alien invasion in this outstanding sci-fi are as satisfactorily flawed in character as they are superior in strength.Director Joss Whedon masterfully balances the egos, not least of which is Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, the S.H.E.I.L.D. leader whose long leather coat is second only to his awkward eye patch. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns from Asgard to fight his half brother, Viking god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) of the lightening and hammer, and five other super heroes for control of earth. Everyone is smart in a way and weak in another. For example, if genius scientist Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) gets angry enough, he becomes a giant green monster, Hulk (and a swell job Ruffalo does at that); Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) with the very metal suit is dangerously loose with his toys and his women. But his banter is first-rate.Martial-arts maven, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), joins as well as Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), whose archery skill is matched only by Katniss in The Hunger Games. Black Widow and Hawkeye probably were added to the group for sex appeal and comic-book accuracy, They all end up fighting for the freedom Loki denigrates in the beginning of the film. The battle of the box office they already won with almost $200 million in European receipts before opening in the states. Who said crime doesn't pay?'There is no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top! Maybe your army will come, maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you! Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it.' Tony Stark to Loki",Null,1,6,4 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," A work of sci-fi art.
","'I did your job once. I was good at it.' Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to K (Ryan Gosling)My review will be short today given the printed request handed to each critic before the preview of Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to the Ridley Scott sci-fi classic. Denis Villeneuve, also director of Arrival, asked us to refrain from revealing major plot points and to approach the review as the audience would without knowing what would happen.I'm all for minimalism about plotting in reviews, so this request is a no-brainer for me. However, I wonder if the director has looked at the trailers to see how much plot has been spilled so far. Oh, well, he has a sturdy science fiction sequel to the iconic Blade Runner, and it co-stars Harrison Ford, who adds grit to his youthful turn in 1982. Based on the Philip Dick novel Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep? this sequel is moodier, headier, and darker than the first. All good.Stone-faced K,an LAPD cop 30 years after the 2019 original setting, is a taciturn blade runner whose job is to track down old replicants (near-human androids) in order to eliminate their danger. The oldest and wisest is Rick (Ford), a master evader for 30 years. K's pursuit of Rick would please Dr. Freud. That's it folks for plot, though I wouldn't mind a call from the director so I could tell him how much I enjoyed his Arrival and Prisoners, both artworks with philosophy and humanity.Blade Runner 2049 is a brilliant, challenging sci-fi with more intellectual content than action. I'm usually negative about the abundance of action in contemporary American films, but here, under the influence of a more reflective producer, Ridley Scott (the original director), the filmmakers seem concerned with magnifying the plot, to hell with action. Besides, the basic sci-fi theme of droids seeking to be human is preserved here, albeit multiple other themes preside as well.Cinematographer Roger Deakins makes sure to provide the surreal, dark, and gloomy ambiance that guarantees a brooding story. Signs along the highway are in multiple languages such as Japanese and Hindi while references to Her, AI, and Dark Knight are carefully placed. Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer provide the cacophony of the junkyard future.It all works despite the wretched state of the future California . The incomparable CGI challenges James Cameron's realistic, surrealistic worlds. Villeneuve's success with Sicario promised this dark world, and he delivers. At 2h 43 min you still won't doze; you just may not be able to figure it all out in that one screening.'Nothing beside remains.

Angels & Demons," It's holy fun.
","'And the Vatican didn't like that. So the church began to, how did you say it? Oh, hunt them down and kill them.' Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks)For a fallen down Catholic boy like me, any time the Church is depicted as manipulative now and downright bloody then (a few centuries ago) confirms my suspicions that it is a business and a brand just like any other multinational corporation. Angels & Demons shows a troubled contemporary Vatican reaching out to its Da Vinci Code antagonist, Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), to solve the mystery and murders associated with an ancient and violent antagonist of the church, The Illuminati, which appears to be revived after ages of obscurity.Given that director Ron Howard was barred from filming in the Vatican, including St. Peter's Square, the production is stunning, an evocation of its baroque grandeur beautiful to see in re-creation. While the serpentine story speeds from church to church to track murders before they happen, Langdon acquires an attractive scientist partner, Dr. Ayelet Zuhrer (Vittoria Vetra), with whom he is intimately involved in solving the crime but not in salving the audience's wound of disappointment for lack of romantic adventure.I applaud the director for allowing the order of the day, stopping murders, to trump the audience's romantic expectations, a distracting Hollywood tradition that needs to die in the face of contemporary sophistication about sexuality and liberation.Although Angels and Demons touches on such religious chestnuts as the struggle between good and evil, it does a credible job tackling the longstanding feud between science and faith, with science and its antimatter discovery threatening half of Rome. But the film doesn't go too far with the debate because it is first of all entertainment with just enough intellectual stimulation to satisfy any stimulus bill around.",Null,3,9,14 May 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It's a killer.
","Europe watch out.  America has a director who can linger just as long as you in a two shot with former lovers conversing about their past and limited future.  Director Quentin Tarantino (`Pulp Fiction,' `Reservoir Dogs') in `Kill Bill: Vol. 2' can also abruptly change aspect ratio to enhance an imprisonment motif, have a two-minute blackout, or change from black and white to color in order to mix a meaning and a mood.  In other words, he now has the European love of character and the long take married to the American love of cinematic effects and action. I no longer have to make apologies to my Euro friends.Beatrix Kiddo, aka Black Mamba and The Bride, played by Uma Thurman, calls her adventure in `Kill Bill' `a roaring rampage of revenge,' an understatement if you consider both `Kill Bill' volumes 1 and 2 barely miss a frame that is not aimed at her revenge for her attempted murder and the massacre of her wedding party at the hands of former lover, Bill (David Carradine), and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. In `Bill' 2, Tarantino spares no comic book or grind house allusion to boast his former video clerk geekiness.  Perhaps the most influential young director today, he still has the childlike wonder about those stories of super heroes flying in the air or Kung fuing like ballerinas. As opposed to the frenetic martial arts and dialogue minimalism of `Kill Bill: Vol.1,' `2' lets us enjoy Beatrix and Bill enjoying each other with dialogue before they engage in deadly battle, albeit not the usual Tarantino gutter lingo.Add to all this virtuosity a sense of humor as sophisticated as any in a French romance, for instance, when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) having introduced a very bad opponent to the venom of a black mamba snake, reads the web description of the deadly effects while he lives them. But Tarantino never keeps his two eyes off his revenge motif, in the end giving his viewers the sense of artistic unity and letting himself enjoy his uniquely stylized violence.  The poet Shelley seemed to be thinking of this auteur in ` The Cenci': `All men enjoy revenge, and most exult Over the tortures they can never feel- Flattering their secret peace with others' pain.' `Kill Bill: Vol.2' is more substantial than `Vol. 1' and closer to a type of filmmaking reserved for only the most talented directors. It's a killer.",Null,1,3,24 April 2004
First Man," It's a splendid ride worth taking in history.
","'You're a bunch of guys making models out of balsa wood! You don't have anything under control!' Janet Armstrong (Claire Foy).After Janet, wife of Neil (Ryan Gosling), in 1969 has been told by Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) at Mission Control that they have everything under control for the moon landing project, Apollo 11, the audience has to agree with her that the control is dicey and probably rests mostly with the astronauts. As Janet implies, no one is completely in control, perhaps only fate is.First Man is the story of the flying '60's, from Neil 's X-15 ride in 1961 ('bouncing off the atmosphere,' as Mission Control says), to the Apollo 11 initiative as the crew prepares to land in 1969 on the moon. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) walk the walk.Throughout, the film is as cool as President Kennedy seeing the obstacles merely a proving ground for the greatness of the US and mankind. It's a powerfully immersive film placing audience in the seat with the star sailors, especially Armstrong, as they go through the various stages of space flight from the important Gemini Project in 1961 to Apollo 11 in 1969. The Apollo 13 film about the aborted 1970 Apollo lunar mission and The Right stuff about the first manned space flight by the US are romantically right on and visually glorious. A different kind of success for First Man is director Damien Chazelle's, who takes us into the cockpit in the air, and at Neil's home, for what are reality shows as they ought to be. The glamour is in the sealed capsules and the ingenuity of the astronauts, whose engineering skills are amply used in harrowing glitches. The reality is the possibility of failure and death families must live with each day.The point of view is mostly Armstrong's even when he's not at the controls. Jane is unlike many other whimpering, complaining 
wives in films where the men do the daring; like Armstrong, she's cool, and especially when she exhorts him to explain to his sons that he might not return from the moon. She's tough with the right stuff for a partner in what the film shows to be an icily daring and dangerous profession.First Man is a story of history, adventure, sentiment, and humanity. It has it all, and while some may complain we don't see the colorful earth and moon enough, Chazelle has shown what the astronauts saw, not what film makers would have liked them to see.'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.' What Neil Armstrong supposedly said with his first step on the moon. Regardless of the 'a' or not 'a,' the act was 'a giant leap for mankind.' First Man is an exciting piece of history writ large and realistically. Be prepared for quite a ride.Celebrate the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's walk.",Null,18,39,10 October 2018
Black Swan," One of the best of 2010
","Erica (Barbara Hershey): What happened to my sweet girl? Nina (Natalie Portman): She's gone!In auteur Darron Aronofsky's Black Swan, the Swan Queen (Portman) is 'gone' even before she's pegged for the lead in Swan Lake. In the best Method Acting spirit, she becomes like the Black Swan because the White Swan is too easy.This is the most melodramatic film of 2010. This is the best actress (Portman) of 2010. This is the best director of 2010. But this may not be the best film of 2010 because of the ease with which it depresses with the over-the-top dramatic conflict between the two poles of innocence and experience, good and evil. It doesn't have the wit and relative subtlety of All about Eve, a film also about female ambition, nor does it have the relative grace of The Red Shoes (1948), a ballet film to which this must be compared.Aronofsky's camera twirls like a ballerina and tracks the star with back shots that become too obvious not to notice. The close-ups of Nina are as constant as in any film with Angelina Jolie, and after a while, enough already. Yet the director catches the frenetic pace of rehearsal with that movement; he also captures the doppelganger of Nina's duality by framing multiple shots through mirrors and reflecting water. After awhile, enough already.There can never be enough of good acting, and this film has a surfeit. Besides Portman's Oscar-worthy performance, Vincent Cassell plays artistic director Thomas Leroy with a genial malevolence that takes the classic impresario in Red Shoes, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), to a new level of Machiavelli, or Pygmalion, if you will. Barbara Hershey as Nina's creepily smothering, former ballerina mother effectively keeps Freud at the forefront. Mila Kunis as Nina's rival has an earthiness that contrasts vividly with the other uptight ballerinas.Black Swan can also be easily seen as a metaphor for the obsession necessary for any great performer. Nina's descent into madness can be nothing less than the natural outcome of greatness achieved at the sacrifice of one's personal freedom and sanity. Despite the flourishes of this hyper drama, Aronofsky has achieved the greatness also in his film: It's not the rude world of his Wrestler with Mickey Rourke also picking at his flesh, but the close up and personal view of an achieving, troubled performer is the same.Nina: 'I had the craziest dream last night about a girl who has turned into a swan, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.'",Null,1,5,15 December 2010
Changeling," An interesting story told well.
","Christine Collins: 'The boy they brought back is not my son.'ClintEastwood s knows a good story, and he knows how to tell it on film. Not everything he does is as powerful as his depiction of a dynamic female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, for which Hilary Swank won a best actress Oscar among four for the film. In Changeling he presents another strong woman, Christine Collins, played by the notable Angelina Jolie. Because she is directed to weep at almost every turn and regularly underplay her grit, Jolie won't win accolades, nor will Eastwood rack up the nominations as he frequently does in Oscar season. But his adaptation of the historic Wineville Chicken Murders chills with his perceptions about the capriciousness of crime and the determination of those who choose to fight it.In a Prohibition-era 1928, Collins gets word that the Los Angeles Police Department is returning her kidnapped eight-year old son. When she sees him at the station, a finely directed sequence showing the forces of motherhood and politics clash, she knows it is not her child. LAPD, needing the good publicity, forces her to take the boy overnight with the logic that she is merely in shock. The rest of this overly long thriller carefully traces the discoveries leading to resolutions and disappointments. Along the way, police corruption is exposed, mental institution incarceration of women is laid bare, and grisly serial murdering is slowly detailed.Yet in this discursive narrative, Eastwood indulges himself beyond Jolie's annoying crying by gratuitously laboring over the details of an execution. The stark San Quentin setting is ghastly and the villain worthy except for the film's obvious criticism of false mental institution lockup, ironic here because this murderer is clearly deranged enough to be determined unfit for trial.As in every Eastwood production, the values are first-rate, in this case period costuming and vehicles (those Model T's and trolley cars are beautiful). As in Mystic River, Eastwood knows how to splice family and community together in the struggle against organized crime, from street violence to public service malpractice. The activist preacher Reverend Briegleb (John Malkovich) helps bring the worlds together in his radio broadcasts, Malkovich for once playing good well. Eastwood continues to be the director of choice for depicting crimes and heartaches that strike the common citizen at will. We all should be as productive in our later years. May he extend well beyond his golf-playing days and into our future.",Null,185,249,28 October 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," I'm over it.
","'Gentlemen, the fountain is the prize. Mermaid waters, that be our path.' Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) In 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,' CaptainJack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) searches for the fountain of youth with the welcome help of Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and the usual suspects. The action is incessant, the eccentric characters plentiful, and the adventure as a whole increasingly thin, an overload of trying hard to be quirky and ending up jerky. Even cameos by Judi Dench and Keith Richards can't surface this sunken treasure.Jack and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) try to beat Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter (Cruz) to the fountain. While the addition of dangerous mermaids adds glamour and sex to a frequently unsexy franchise (faithful to its family orientation), this enormous franchise needs to drink from that fountain itself. Johnny Depp's drunken, fey pirate is getting old (he did get an Oscar nomination back when this was fresh stuff in 2003), the affectations merely keeping us from understanding what he is saying rather than adding to his characterization.Additionally, the fight scenes rival Lord of the Rings for their excessive number and blinding cutting, leaving one to wonder if director Rob Marshall didn't just take footage from other swashbuckling movies. But the greatest thief of all is the 3-D pirate of lighting: The process drains light from scenes, and not just in this film. I'm a big supporter of 2-D.And, yes, I'm over this franchise. When Geoffrey Rush and Ian McShane make me think of their previous acting triumphs rather their respective roles as Barbossa and Blackbeard, when the addition of a clichéd love between a mermaid and a preacher make you beg for the return of Orlando and Keira, and when Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz can't make me forget this is a dull sequel, then it's time to let someone else handle the critique of the next installment.",Null,3,9,19 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Best since Butch and Sundance.
","Agent J: Who are we? Agent K: We are no-one. Our mission is to monitor extraterrestrial activity on Earth.Summer Sci-Fi just got a whole lot more amusing with Men in Black III, an entertaining action comedy with the best duo since Butch and Sundance. Will Smith as Agent J is light-hearted and lithe while Tommy Lee Jones's Agent K is stone-faced and stolid. Together they are fun at their repartee and sweet in their affection. The two have chemistry.J must travel back to 1969 to save K from being murdered in the present. While time travel has been overworked in film, this case is at least carefully drawn: The late '60's are meticulously re-created, the action is credible, and Josh Brolin as the young K is spot-on with his imitation of Tommy Lee Jones. The chemistry between the early K and J is every bit as enjoyable as that of the older K. The now required female agents' boss, Agent O (Emma Thompson), fares well as a sympathetic head of MIB, and her 1969 self (Alice Eve) is an accurate depiction of a young O. Times sure have changed now that females rule the roost (see James Bond, for example).Bill Heder's intriguing cameo of Andy Warhol captures the ironic cool of the '60's, bashing the proletarian pop culture while at the same time adoring it. Baddie Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) can be as mean as any villain in The James Bond canon.The sets are just as cool as they were in the first two MIB but less impressive given how used we are to CGI. The guns, well, they do grab attention. Yet it is the attempt at character development that most impresses me, the need to go deeper, even back in time, to develop character. I never thought I'd be praising that effort in a summer blockbuster.",Null,5,19,23 May 2012
Frost_Nixon," An Oscar Contender
","David Frost: Are you really saying the President can do something illegal? Richard Nixon: I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's *not* illegal! David Frost: ... I'm sorry?Finally a legitimate Oscar candidate for best picture and actor. Believe me I was determined not to like the hollywoodization of Frost/Nixon after I had been thrilled by the London stage production with Michael Sheen and Frank Langella in the titular roles. It turns out that Ron Howard's film is the perfect film complement to the stage production as it moves to offices and locations the stage couldn't and as it gives more time to supporting roles.Most of all the close-ups are the distinguishing film contribution to this historical 1977 event in which unremarkable TV host David Frost gave former president Richard Nixon 4 interviews, the final one devoted to Watergate. For the last 30 years many of us have been relieved by Nixon's admitting in the fourth interview that he erred in the cover up leading to his resignation, the only president in history to do so. The film is not as prosaic as my synopsis, for its drama is distributed slowly by flashback and talking heads in an unobtrusive documentary style that efficiently gives facts but relies on the drama to make a compelling story.For most of the film, Ron Howard focuses on the boyish Frost as his impending tragedy is that he can't find enough funding for the project. Coupled with his playboy image and perception of him as a lightweight (although he graduated from Oxford, for goodness sake), the first half of the film is agonizing for sympathizers.Director Howard uses the camera like a scalpel dissecting every puff and pain on Langella's Nixonian visage. He plays the Nixon characteristics with subtlety; on the stage, he didn't overplay either, in fact underplayed them all. The film Nixon more closely reflects his real-life identifiers such as jowls, stoop, and hairline; the stage relied less so even with Langella in the role.Both productions carry the fascination with a tricky president who still had artifice about him long after his boys had stormed Watergate.",Null,4,8,5 December 2008
Howl's Moving Castle," Original and Thoughtful
","Now I know why everyone was excited about Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar winning animation, because his new Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from a British novel by Diana Wynne Jones, is more original and thoughtful than any American entry in that genre. The visuals of flat, classic animation with slow-moving characters and painterly backgrounds are alone worth the experience, the castle itself an imaginative hodgepodge of chicken-legged monsters from Russian folklore and cumbersome war machines from Star Wars. As the director has said, 'I've told the people on my CGI staff not to be accurate, not to be true. We're making a mystery here, so make it mysterious.'The plot is almost inscrutable as it depicts a kind of late nineteenth-century European city in which hat shop girl Sophie alternately is wooed by a cute wizard, Howl, and cursed by a witch to be shifted into an old crone's body. Her Dorothy-like wandering with, among others, a pogo-sticked scarecrow, takes her to the titular castle of Howl, where she cleans, keeps order, and longs for Howl. Ultimately she confronts a sorceress, Madam Suliman. War ensues but can't defeat the power of love.The real strength of Howl's Moving Castle is in character diversity and development with a vain, kind, and immature hero; villains morphing into lovable friends and a fire that talks like Billy Crystal and surpasses Eddie Murphy's wisecracking donkey. These are just some of the touches of this hip Asian anime that comments on the folly of war promoted by very neocon-like leaders and the endlessly interesting conflicts between the good and bad angels of each character. Shape-shifting heroine Sophie says, 'I don't want to live if I can't be beautiful!' Now there's my kind of self-centered lady, heroic and callow in the same film.No one-dimensional characters for this director, perhaps the most gifted animator in the world.",10,14,22,17 June 2005
Walk the Line," Enjoyable for the music and performances, but not for originality.
","Reese Witherspoon should win an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of June Carter, the wife of country/pop legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) in Walk the Line, the biography of Cash until the two married. Director James Mangold takes no chances with this biopic: Cash is as we knew him: hard driving, substance abusive, womanizing, and one of the most talented musicians of the 20th century. Because the same could be said of Ray Charles in last year's Ray, both the lives of some great entertainers and the films that depict them could be considered formulas no one dares to tamper with. It's tough to earn an A in this genre for originality.Phoenix does a credible job imitating Cash although the screenplay offers little insight into how he developed his style or why he was abusive to himself and Carter; however it does play ad nauseam the conflict between Cash and his tight-fisted father, Ray (Robert Patrick). Phoenix has down Cash's signature roll with his guitar and more famously the basso greeting to each audience, 'Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.'Would that Mangold had spent more time with Cash and Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), the Sun Records mogul, who weaned Cash from gospel into music from his heart. As it is, we have one tryout session, enough to make me want much more of that creative molding. The Folsom Prison sequence captures the gritty and humane side of Cash, who not only thought this was the best audience on the tour but also empathized with their bad boy backgrounds. Too much time is spent watching Cash fall and then rise againenough already, I get the idea within 5 minutes. And would that we could have more of Witherspoon and Phoenix singing together; they may not be as good as Cash and Carter, but they surely are electric enough to hold my delighted attention. In whole, Walk the Line is enjoyable for the music and performances, but not for originality.",Null,5,20,15 November 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Elementary Holmes
","Professor Moriarty: Are you sure you want to play this game? Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, my mind turns two ways: The first half is guns, gunpowder, and gymnastics. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) contend with the salvation of civilization mostly through athletics, aided by director Guy Ritchie's considerable skill with the camera and graphics.But in the second half, when the duo moves swiftly but intellectually to confront the arch villain Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), my mind is at equilibrium, renewing my love of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original brainy, eccentric sleuth. The chess game is a marvel of strategy, replete with revenge, intrigue, and just plain ingenuity. Director Guy Ritchie's visuals include delightful Downey disguises and lively speed ramping in a forest bombarded by bullets. Hans Zimmer's music leans heavily on the fiddle to lighten the load of a difficult plot.Watson's marriage, rather than taking away from the bromance, adds unexpected color and creativity. So Ritchie has ramped up the intellectual content and at least balanced it with the athletic, which was a strength of his 2009 version, Sherlock Holmes. With Inspector Lastrade just a memory and Holmes's love, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), appearing briefly, we are left to enjoy not so much the interaction of Holmes and Watson but the explosiveness of Holmes and Moriarty.After a first half of explosions, the second half satisfies traditionalists like me for the chess game of life and death—and that's the suspenseful fate of the world in those pieces. Director Guy Ritchie has improved on his 2009 version.",Null,146,216,16 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Anger Management
","'There are aspects of my personality that I can't control. And when I lose control, it's very dangerous to be around me.' Bruce Banner It's instructive to end the Incredible Hulk with the appearance of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) foreshadowing the reunion of Marvel superheroes in a few years and showing how limited Hulk as character is next to the complicated, interesting Iron Man. Where Hulk has to worry only about expunging his deadly radiation poisoning (that inflates his body to Kong size when he's angry), Iron Man runs an arms industry that helps defend the greatest society in the world but spawns enemies who use his own weapons against him,.It's no Iron Man, but the Incredible Hulk will keep your adolescent boys' attention if they will stay for the hour or so of back story and set up. Maybe the lack of complicated character in Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) makes me long for Robert Downey, Jr.'s conflicted Iron Man; at any rate plenty of CGI fighting goes on here with few of the distractions along the psychoanalytical route there were for Iron Man.Banner needs an antidote for his uncontrollable anger, which thrusts him into a Kong-sized dilemma as he contends not only with a monster just like him (Tim Roth), but also a love for Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) that has him engage in some Kong-like rescue for her, climbing buildings--you know the drill.Meanwhile, the consummate meany is General Ross (William Hurt), who wants more Hulks while Hulk would like to annihilate them, even his irascible self if the death could be arranged. If not, Hulk will return another day, but I won't be waiting for him: I have enough angry ex-wives who are more fearsome and more entertaining than this CGI-heavy, personality-light superhero.",Null,4,10,10 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Entertaining search for a Madonna and other great pieces.
","'This is our history. It's not to be stolen or destroyed. It's to be held up and admired.' Frank StokesConsidering the great art works recovered from the Nazis in 1944 by the Monuments Men, losing 2 lives in the operation might have been worth it. Or at least that's the struggle of the hero in the titular film inspired by the events: Frank Stokes (George Clooney), a curator at Harvard's Fogg Museum, goes back to the Army to head a small art recovery contingent (7—most out of shape and aging like John Goodman), with echoes of the Magnificent Seven and Dirty Dozen recruiting sequences, promising exceptional wit and action that doesn't materialize.Why is such a high-concept plot lost in a February opening? Possibly because it's enjoyable but not remarkable, a pastiche of brief episodes not always connected to the plot's central vision (shooting at a German sniper youth thought to be an adult?). The episodes may be meant to establish character while sliding over them to chronicle a not always interesting path to the mines and castle where the Nazis have hidden the loot. At least the studio had the good sense not to pit this modest adventure against, say, American Hustle or 12 Years a Slave in the Oscar prelims in November and December.The action picks up as they find the destinations, but along the way James Granger (Matt Damon) interacts with Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) in a low-key romance that finds great art but small love. Changing Claire from the original monument woman Rose into a love-seeking operative angers some historians. Another concern besides history and coherence is tone: Reverence for the mission clashes with the jokey camaraderie of old-fashioned WWII movies.It is a delight to hear the names of artists like Picasso and Rembrandt even though they had little influence on the film's fair-to midlin' screenplay penned by Clooney and Grant Heslov. Looking for Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges and van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece is definitely grand, but the grandeur is not matched by the screenplay.As for directing, Clooney misses the sharpness of his Good Night and Good Luck while he helms here what seems a small story about an odd group of soldiers struggling to rise to the occasion of history's greatest art reclamation. It's an enjoyable film but not a great one.",Null,17,32,6 February 2014
Miracle," `Miracle' is what American filmmakers do best.
","`Seabiscuit' on ice?  `Miracle' is what American filmmakers do best: a rousing true tale of an underdog overcoming insurmountable odds to win the prize. Director Gavin O'Connor's dramatization of the 1980 USA Winter Olympic team's victory over Russia's juggernaut champions for 15 years is even more exuberant than the horse race because the team represented the renewal of American spirit in times gloomy in the recounting. `Mighty Ducks' this is not.`Seabiscuit's' depression era salvaging spirit seems a bit tame next to Iranian hostage takers, empty gas pumps, post Watergate, and Viet Nam, a few of the dark events that left President Jimmy Carter few options other than to scold the American people for indolence and apathy.  The opening titles' montage of period footage is the best I have seen to establish an era whose hopes and fears were crystallized in this new team of very young players. Make no mistake about it; the film's focus is the US victory over the USSR, so much so that the final victory for the Olympic gold over Finland is but a footnote.USA veteran hockey coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) knows it's not just a game, as his enduring wife (Patricia Clarkson) reminds him in the hours when he is most absorbed in game films and firings and neglecting his family.  In fact, `Miracle' is about this remarkable coach's vision that only the most grueling practice will prepare them for the best team in the world. He purposely at one point verbally beats them up, walks out of the room, and says to his assistant coach Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich), `That ought to wake them up.' His assistant coach, team doctor, and board overseers do not agree with his aloof tactics but are mute at the final victory when the announcer remarks about the team's stunning stamina.The Americans' average age was 21; some of the USSR's players had been on the ice together for 15 years.  Intimidation was the key Russian strategy (as well as some of the best players in the world).  This grim group probably couldn't remember when it was last defeated (early 60's?).  But the Americans prevailed in a victory the director makes immediate and visceral with Steadicam, close up, and swelling music.The film lacks the ability to tell exactly why the USA won, besides the painful preparation, because the Russians remain faceless, only the coach briefly featured as a lean Brezhnev with beetle eye brows and nary a smile from him or his team. At a point in the game when the Americans surge ahead, Brooks remarks that the coach didn't know what to do.  Darrell Royal, commenting on football coaches, gives an insight into Herb Brooks' success: `A head coach is guided by this main objective: dig, claw, wheedle, coax that fanatical effort out of players.'Wish we knew more about that elusive success, but this we do know: Herb Brooks was responsible for putting together the finest group of young hockey players in American history, training them to the point of retching and fainting, suffering from a lack of faith around him, and delivering gold worth more to a nation than all the jewels of a monarchy.",Null,0,1,12 February 2004
Lucky Number Slevin," A saucy mock thriller
","'I'm a world-class assassin, F---head,' exclaims Brice Willis's Mr. Goodkat to hero Josh Hartnett's Slevin, a young man the target of mobsters in a classic case of mistaken identity. Willis has a minimalist charm that makes him everybody's hit man, as cool as any hood coming out of the tongue-in-cheek school of Pulp Fiction, Get Shorty, or North by Northwest. In fact, he survives quite well working for both sides of two warring New York gangster clans. He describes the catalytic event for the story as a 'Kansas City shuffle,' a gambling term hinting at the reversals of almost every scene in this riff on film noir wrapped in a stylish con.When the crime bosses are played by Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley, it would seem futile for Hartnett to go nose to nose with those thespian icons. But he does successfully. The script calls for underplaying the violence and irony and for a light-hearted delivery contrasting the murders while playing with the girl next door, charmingly acted by Lucy Liu as Lindsey.Just as playful is cinematographer Christopher Sova's color scheme, with enough variety to make the wildest Asian DP jealous. On the other hand, Joshua Ralph's original music is unenviable.Lucky Number Slevin was a selection for the 2006 Sundance Film Festival but not a thunderous winner. Then again, its smug, self-reflective wit, lost in the resolution of the film but everywhere Slevin has a chance to shoot off his mouth, may have been overdone. Even starry-eyed Park-City visitors are smart enough to spy a phony.But then, like The Usual Suspects, nothing is as it seems in this saucy thriller, so just sit back and enjoy the twistshardly in the Memento leaguesome of which you can see coming and others amusingly a surprise.",Null,0,6,1 April 2006
Captain Phillips," It's historical. It's full of action. It's Paul Greengrass. It's good.
","'Everything is going to be okay,' Muse (Barkhad Abi)Yes, for Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), everything did turn out 'okay' as Muse, the captain of four pirate Somalis, kept assuring him. Not so for the pirates. In the docudrama Captain Phillips, director Paul Greengrass has once again used his expertise with the hand-held camera and an uncanny sense of tense drama to take, as he did in United 93, an historical drama and make it painfully real. When the pirates take over the Maersk Alabama cargo ship off the coast of Somalia in 2009, the captain ends up in a motorized life-boat with the pirates to experience claustrophobia in the Das Boot tradition and a keen awareness of danger, although we know that at least he will survive.The genius of American action films, especially real-life adventures involving crack American units like the Navy SEALS, such as in Zero Dark Thirty, is to keep our attention wedded to action whose results we already know. The tension aboard the unarmed ship (those defending hoses are weak) is vivid while the pirates search for the hidden crew. Yet the drama aboard the little life-craft trumps all else while the pirates argue among themselves and Phillips does a heroic turn of applying psychological warfare.Hanks has cornered the film market on decent, common men in uncommon, demanding circumstances. His scene on the rescue ship is an effective depiction of a man suffering more from concern about his family than the physical pain the pirates inflict. Hanks' ability to project a love of humanity, even these pirates, is unparalleled. Look for his nomination at Oscar time.Although we have seen this type of action before, notably in the excellent Danish docudrama The High Jacking last year, Captain Phillips takes it up close and personal. You can almost say you were there.'I know how to handle Americans,' Muse says. That's a hollow boast because even most of us (Congress included) aren't good at handling our fellow Americans. Except for Tom Hanks, of course.",Null,2,9,10 October 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Cool, sentimental, and melodramatic
","In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Charlie (Logan Lerman) is sixteen and an introvert in a central-casting high school with babes and bullies and a post modern touch of gay. In addition, pot-filled brownies, Rocky Horror sing alongs, and child abuse dot the dramatic landscape, eluding the extreme realism accusation with a semi-sweet nostalgic look at high school.The charm of Perks is in writer/director Stephen Chbosky's cool and sentimental notions about coming of age, emphasized by Charlie's voice over and his low-key but at times disturbed recollections on his way to maturity. It lacks the more mature disappointments in (500) Days of Summer, the silliness of Sixteen Candles, the humor of Ferris Bueller, and the out-there of Napoleon Dynamite. On its own merits, it has nothing like those to make it memorable except an appealing Charlie whose arc is not overdone—he just gets a bit wiser as anyone in those years would be if he's aware enough and has the good fortune to fall in love with Emma Watson (playing elusive girl friend, Sam). Throw in some serious childhood trauma , and you still have a melodrama of no great import, just the story of a boyish introvert who happens to be a boyishly good looking actor, Logan Lerman, and his new, eccentric friends, headed by lovable Sam.Is it formulaic? Yes, but in the service of known teenage behaviors not too far from a serviceable Hollywood reality. Do bullies harass him? Yes, but less than in other clichéd films. Does he fall in love with an unattainable girl? Yes, but he doesn't madly pursue her because his mind has other more substantial demons. Is he the brightest but quietest student in his English class, Yes, but we all know the price to pay if you answer English teacher's questions right, so his reticence is strategically acceptable although he is so reserved you might initially question him as the protagonist of any film. Is his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), tuned into him? Yes, but in one of the most realistic ways I have seen. This is not the hip Breakfast Club or Risky Business.

10 Cloverfield Lane," It does the horror genre proud.
","'Don't leave me! You don't know what's out there.' Howard (John Goodman) Everything is out there in this entertaining horror flick called 10 Cloverfield Lane. It has the usual tropes but manages to be surprising at every turn and satisfying at character development. In other words, for a date you couldn't do better with something to please geeks and non geeks alike.Twenty-something Michelle is abducted by Howard, imprisoning her in his survival bunker for not-so-clear motives. He's a fat middle-aged former military guy, and she's an attractive wife who just left her husband. So there's a bit of Room here, what with her confinement and a bland young man as well, Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.). It doesn't appear to be a sexual kidnapping, for Howard talks about saving her after an accident and the two of them from an alien invasion.You can see my fascination about his scary but complex story because Howard may be lying about the invasion and the polluted atmosphere, or he could be substituting Michelle for his dead daughter. It's enjoyable to try to understand Howard's motives, and it's viscerally a treat to see Michelle empowered like a feminine super hero in her attempts to escape. While Cloverfield Lane is no feminist tract, it has touches of social awareness as it emphasizes her wit, the slower wit of Emmett, and the sharpness of seemingly sluggish Howard.Director Dan Tractenberg and producer J.J. Abrams barely miss a chance to play the jump-scare staple, be it a hand coming up an air duct or a zombie-like woman outside the bunker's window. While devotees of the genre will be delighted by the inclusion of many formulaic elements, the regular audience should just have fun at the scary episodes leading to a somewhat surprising final segment. Or they may simply enjoy watching one of filmdom's best actors, John Goodman. A good man he is, but whether or not the character he portrays is, well, that's up to you.

3:10 to Yuma," Seven/Noon
","'The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever.' Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer In 3:10 to Yuma, a few references to The Magnificent Seven and the idea of a train arriving at a specific time when good and bad guys converge, as in High Noon, made viewing this Glenn Ford remake from 1957 a pleasant one. And right I was but for even more good reasons.Not since Unforgiven and The Quick and the Dead have I been as excited about seeing a Western in its heroic and revisionist forms. 3:10 to Yuma is a true Western in the American film tradition about the 19th-century American West: It has clear heroes and villains (and a mixture of those), wide prairies, dirty towns, fast guns, weak lawmen, cunning murderers, kids on the cusp, and women marginalized, just for starters.Then ratchet up to the philosophical/post modern/post Eastwood reflections on the profession of being a gunman juxtaposed with being a responsible father, and you have an classic angst-filled clash where villain has a wee bit of heart and hero an equal measure of cowardice. Delightfully mix in a certifiable baddie in the Lee Van Cleef/Jack Palance tradition, Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) as Wade's amoral lieutenant Charlie Prince (as in 'of darkness'). Best of all, it is nail-bitingly suspenseful and beautifully photographed.In order to pickup some home-saving cash, poor crippled farmer Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is helping transport murderer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to court via the 3:10 to Yuma from Bisbee, Arizona. Getting Wade to the station is no easy task, even for the several deputies, because Wade's evil gang is in hot pursuit and more importantly, Wade is psychologically working on them from within, alternately charming and brutal; just imagine his roguish smile behind an extremely fast gun and unscrupulous conscience.It's hard to believe a studio could dump such a winner in the dog days of summer. I will say only that if you have even a modicum of respect for this genre, see 3:10 to Yuma and relive the golden days of straight-up shoot-em ups with rough-hewn characters, electric plot, and revisionist attitude about the romance of being an outlaw or a farmer.

The Equalizer," Even liberals will like the action.
","'The great and abiding lesson of American history, particularly the cold war, is that the engine of capitalism, the individual, is mightier than any collective.' Rand PaulHe's not the detached Jason Bourne and he's not the swinging Bond, but Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is tougher than the two. A modest Home Mart employee, he has a past no one knows about. When asked by some young co-workers, he admits to being a 'Pip,' as in Gladys. So goes Robert's infrequent wit in the exciting The Equalizer, based on an ancient TV show.Although he has a limited sense of humor, his past working for a federal investigative agency was intense and unusual enough that he went into a protection plan with a new life. While visiting a diner straight out of Hopper (he is a 'nighthawk'), he meets very young escort Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) and spends the rest of the movie revisiting his considerable killing skills to protect her.So far nothing new except no romance, many clichés, and stereotypes (especially the Russian mobsters and their thugs). However Denzel brings a quiet competence and compassion to Robert's character despite kicking ass every few minutes. Thus, consider the relevance of Rand Paul's comment introducing this essay about the power of the individual. Liberals, however, will enjoy the action with its mixture of caring and retribution.Interestingly, although the Equalizer doesn't stray far from the thriller formula, the characters are unique enough to enlist your sympathy, and we all know from our Greek dramas the importance of having sympathy for the hero.One of the more fascinating motifs is creative killing, wherein at one point, the hero uses material in the home improvement building to take out the Russians. The killing is clean, there's little blood, and it's fun to watch if you enjoy that kind of thing.Given the heat generated by Putin over the Ukraine, this smart film is prescient about the resurgence of Cold War situations and attitudes:'The Cold War isn't thawing; it is burning with a deadly heat.

Ali," A very good biography of a charismatic boxer, whose life could have had a greater intensity if Martin Scorcese had directed Will Smith the way he did Robert De Niro in `Raging Bull.'
","Michael Mann made me a fan when he introduced me to Brian Cox as a cunning Hannibal Lecter in `Manhunter.' I was further impressed by Mann's ability to coax an Oscar nomination out of Russell Crowe's `Insider' performance. Now Mann may have done it again with Will Smith as `Ali.'No, Smith isn't quite up to the Academy Award because he underplays just slightly one of the great mouths of sports, Mohammed Ali.  Mann does make him look and talk like Ali, without the peculiar energy and attitude owned exclusively by the greatest athlete of the 20th century.
Jon Voight, however, is flawless playing the sportscaster, Howard Cosell, who was a close friend of Ali. The film would have benefited from more of their relationship and less of the actual boxing and the love affairs, which add little to understanding the great boxer except that he was a gentle womanizer.The film is made too long by too many lingering close ups and too many bouts with Liston, Frasier, and Foreman. More even of Ali's friendship with Malcolm X would have served Mann well.  But what we have is what we have-a very good biography of a charismatic boxer, whose life could have had a greater intensity if Martin Scorcese had directed Will Smith the way he did Robert De Niro in `Raging Bull.'",Null,0,1,18 December 2001

'I know not,' said the second Shape,'I only died last night.'Thomas Bailey Aldrich, IdentityBe it from aborigines or astrophysicists, alternative-universe theories intrigue me. Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself not in Afghanistan, where he was just flying helicopter missions but as a civilian on a train going to Chicago. Although the beauty opposite him, Christina (Michelle Monaghan), knows him as someone else, he does not know her or anyone else on the train.Source Code is a sci-fi with a brain, perhaps not as intriguing to as The Assignment Bureau, but engaging nonetheless because like that study of free will, Source Code also dabbles in physics and metaphysics just long enough to make us believe that a character like the Captain can be part of a simulation project that sends him back to 8 minutes on that train in order to find its bomber to stop subsequent sabotage.Director Duncan Jones opens with music and shots of Chicago and the train moving toward it as Hitchcock might have, or did in a similar way in the opening North by Northwest, with the train coming later. The suspense reminds me also of Hitch as it hovers around identity, or loss thereof, and greater consequences than just for ordinary mistaken identity. Colter falling for Christina is not a stretch anymore than Cary Grant falling for Eva Marie Saint or Mark Damon for Emily Blunt, charming women all. As in Adjustment, the growing romance helps in the reality department where the metaphysics seems unbelievable.At this time of year, a dead zone for movies in the first four months, it's comforting to have brainy movies to relax with. Come to think of it, Liam Neeson's Unknown, while not sci-fi, is concerned with the loss of identity as in Source Code.

","'We are not now that strength which in old days Moved heaven and earth; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.' Alfred Lord Tennyson, spoken by M (Judi Dench)The 50th anniversary 23rd James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is a superior combination of nostalgia for the old-school spy story and the smarmy, glamorous new, the seasoned Bond and the young, techno-oriented operatives. The ancient reliance on intuition and human footwork and technology like the Aston Martin Db5 has been challenged by computer technology that can crash a train or blow up a building with far less manpower and combat than in previous iterations. Bond (Daniel Craig) resurrects himself after being presumed dead in Istanbul from the traditional preamble (as good as the best Bond opener ever) to help M (Judi Dench) find the maniac who has commandeered the computers of M16 and threatens to reveal the identities of the agencies deeply-covered spies. Amid all this chaos, the typical Bond madman, Silva (Javier Bardem—remember him as the heavy in No Country for Old Men?), has a reason from the past to seek revenge on M. Bardem's play of menace and self parody is so refined as to make you forget the impressive Gert Frobe as Goldfinger. Adele's modern theme song is delightfully evocative of sultry Shirley Bassey tunes. The old and the new work for the enduring franchise.So begins the link to the past that culminates in a climactic standoff scene in a remote region of Scotland, where Bond may find real spiritual comfort while neglecting his trademark womanizing.The requisite chase scene at the beginning of the film is splendid to behold with motorcycles racing over roof tops and trains, and through outdoor markets. Roger Deakins' cinematography is a kaleidoscopic buffet, be it the cool blue of Shanghai or the grey of Scotland.As always the really interesting drama is Bond and M and Bond and Silva exchanging barbs. Fine actors all and a delight to hear.The rest of the film plays off the conflict between the old and new, culminating in fire war between shotguns and helicopters in an abandoned estate in Scotland. Also Q (Ben Whishaw) is new, a young whippersnapper who needs to be taught the value of the old school, and he is taught that in the course of the action. The new Bond played by Daniel Craig is a more business-like operative than Sean Connery's, more Jason Bourne, brooding and crying, less dashing, not as interested in seduction,but he is more efficient and caring.It's all fitting for a new age when technology and humanity collide.

The Young Victoria," Needed romantic stretching
","'I am young, but I am willing to learn, and I mean to devote my life to the service of my country and my people.' Queen Victoria (Emily Blunt)As queens of England go, Victoria was bested only by the great Elizabeth. Emily Blunt's young Victoria in this titular biopic is a young woman acceding to the throne in her eighteenth year with the limitations and inexperience of youth but native wit and grit of high order enough to carry her through the nineteenth century, almost as great a century as the seventeenth.The Young Victoria does a credible job showing Victoria struggling with those powerful politicians like Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who truly watch out for her but inevitably push their own agenda. The only one to be destined a lifetime adviser is Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), whose courtship of the queen takes up most of the film with no small amount of schmaltz and I suspect some stretching of the romantic natures of both principals.Yet they did have nine children, a testimony to the solidarity of their marriage and a gift from the devoted Albert, who reigned with her only 20 years until he died of typhoid. But not before he took a bullet for her. No wonder they named a pipe tobacco after him—he was a good man, as Melbourne admits to Victoria. But Albert as dashing as Rupert Friend—I doubt it. Victoria attractive as Emily Blunt—I doubt it. Take a look at photos of the real lovers.The film captures the tapestry of nineteenth-century royal life from sumptuous rooms to ornate costumes. Unfortunately too little effort is spent on the intriguing intrigues of Lord Melbourne and the political acumen of Sir Robert Peele (Michael Maloney).

","Leapin' Leo!!! The boy can act! With iconic Steven Spielberg directing, Leonardo DiCaprio finally has my attention in his second big-picture opening in December, 'Catch Me If You Can.' I had much to say about Daniel Day-Lewis in 'Gangs of New York' and little about Leo. But his Cary Grant turn as a young '60's con man hounded by straitlaced FBI check-fraud specialist Tom Hanks is smooth and understated, boyish but adult, sexy but not trashy.Based on the autobiography of Frank Abagnale, Jr., this tale takes us back to Spielberg's fanciful yarns and happily away from the recent bleak allegories like 'Minority Report.' In short, Spielberg has brought out the boyish man in Leo, and who better than the director of 'E.T.' and numerous other box-office heavyweights whose thematic underpinnings come from assaults on the integrity of the home. Using charming bad-boy Christopher Walken as Leo's dad is another of the director's genial touches-a loving father, mischievous and loyal, whose romantic spirit endears his son and us while French mom divorces Walken and marries a very Rotarian James Brolin. Never once do you doubt Walken is the source of DiCaprio's love of the romantic scam, dressing up to impress the ladies and conning the rich out of a few bucks, mostly Pan Am stewardesses and the airline itself.'Catch Me If You Can' reaches back into Spielberg's lyrical relationship with childhood by showing a dysfunctional family turned right by some very wrong moves, engagingly presented in the old-fashioned scams Leo spins pretending to be a pilot, physician, and lawyer. Morality aside, it's fascinating adventure for dreamers and those who don't want to spend the effort required to enter glamorous professions.My favorite moment expressing Spielberg's longing for family connection comes on one of the many Christmas Eves Hanks and Leo spend on the phone enjoying their cat and mouse game. Hanks exclaims, 'I know why you called. You don't have anyone else.' Hanks's laugh is perfectly pitched at the loneliness of Leo's wandering, amoral life.With the mid-20th century Hollywood animated credits, a combination of Woody Allen and James Bond, to the elegantly jazzy score of John Williams (sounding ever so much like Hitchcock's Bernard Hermann), this film marks the new career of a young star and the confirmation of a noted director with many years of new old stuff ahead.",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
The Hangover," Underdressed
","'I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust.' Alan (Zach Galifianakis)If you want more anti-PC humor, The Hangover gives it: gay Asian thugs, old man without underwear, shrill girlfriend, lovable whore, and Holocaust joke (see above). This boys-will-be boys comedy thriller has enough raunch and racism to garner a near NC-17 (stay for the credits) and enough crude laughs to make a few hundred mil.The weekend in Vegas for three groomsmen and a groom before the wedding turns into a lost one for the revelers, who can't remember what happened because a low-rent dealer gave them a date-rape drug rather than cocaine. The result is the chaos only a fiancé could dream of: lost tooth, child, and tiger; marriage to a hooker; $80 K of debt; and some very perturbed waiting women at home. The premise of their retracing the evening is a good one, providing a flashback with a detective edge. Throughout, the dialogue does not hold up to Judd Apitow standards, and the payoffs for the setups are weak. The film is humor underdressed for a wedding.",Null,2,6,1 July 2009
Iron Man 3," Smart, sassy, and stylish.
","'I'm Tony Stark. I build neat stuff, got a great girl, occasionally save the world. So why can't I sleep?' You can't sleep because writer/director Shane Black has made you this third time around the most interesting superhero since Superman flew onto the comic book scene. Played by the snarky, sardonic, witty, and conflicted Robert Downey Jr., billionaire Tony Stark, weapons maker and new-age hero, faces a terrorist menace named Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), whose likeness to Osama bin Laden is not a coincidence, and his accomplice, Aldrich Killian ( a memorably menacing Guy Pearce). In the end, however, the greatest antagonist for the insouciant hero is himself, who can't sleep so consumed is he by the contradictions of his heroic mission.The thriller tropes are all there, but Black has decided to use his writing experience for Lethal Weapon and obvious familiarity with old film comedies to enhance the repartee among the principle players, including Stark's love and assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and War Machine rival, Colonel James Rhodes (Con Cheadle). Yet more memorable than these talented vets is Ty Simpkins playing Harley Keener, a bright little boy who helps Stark, not just with electronics but also dialogue smart and fast reminiscent of the vintage screwball comedies.Although Stark is a fast-moving one line organ (As he suits up: 'You know, it's moments like these when I realize how much of a superhero I am.'), when he's with the above-mentioned characters, especially Harley, the humor is as fast as the ubiquitous missiles and subtly laden with thematic weight. The emphasis on witty dialogue made the difference for me between a good thriller and a great one.Because by my count this is the fourth movie in a few months to center its action on endangering the president of the US (Olympus Has Fallen, GI Joe, and the upcoming White House Down are the other 3), I see a concern underneath our pop culture for the safety of our open society symbolized by the vulnerable president. While in general I am impatient with many film deaths and explosions, I am intrigued by how we can accept so much terrorism on screen, from 9/11 through Iron Man 3.Perhaps these escapist entertainments help purge our fears by showing everything landing right for the country, its leaders, and its audience. If that's too heavy for you, then see this film just to enjoy its state-of-the-art graphics, talented actors, and resolutions that will not leave you indifferent to the will of the American people to overcome their fears: 'The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself!'

Marie Antoinette," Coppola can do better.
","'Ennui'For a French-based film by a most promising writer/director, I can think of only the word for BORING. How is it possible to spend millions of dollars on one of the most sumptuous-looking films in years and yet create a story so devoid of character and drama as to make Dangerous Liaisons seem an energetic masterpiece? Based on Antonia Fraser's book about the archduchess of Austria and later queen of France, Marie Antoinette is about a 14 year old girl imported for breeding purposes to be Louis XVI's wife. That the French revolutionaries see her as the symbol of French decadence is as well known as her lovely neck.Surely Sofia Coppola can do better with the story of Marie Antoinette, one of the most fascinating characters out of history, whose famous line, 'Let them eat cake,' probably wasn't even hers. The subject cries out for an informed, vital discovery of her real place in the French Revolution. What we get is distance and dreariness as almost an entire film is dedicated to sumptuous costuming and slacker inaction in the bed of a future king and queen.As overly long as the many interminable long shots, but beautiful in composition and lighting (How can you really go wrong with Versailles?), the lack of drama is surprising for a director whose strength is understatement and sub-textual significance. Her Oscar winning Lost in Translation is a triumph of underplaying-- two people (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) drawn to each other in a culture, Japan, which accentuated their loneliness, longing, and civility. And all of this subtlety is conveyed with a minimum of dialogue but a maximum of feeling from two consummate actors, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Now Kirsten Dunst is unquestionably lovely as Marie, but when she talks her voice has a teenage tone that makes me wonder if the director had her sound as immature as Marie actually was or that Dunst is just not the actress Johansson is. In any case, no one in the film is given lines to be proud of, and no one gives a performance that could be characterized as nuanced or imaginative.Visit Versailles if you want to understand why the poor and hungry of 18th century France eventually had her head. This film will only confirm the prevailing notion that Marie was misunderstood; that she was profligate as a teenager makes for an unsatisfying 2 hour drama.",Null,3,9,18 October 2006
Deepwater Horizon," Great effects. Light on ecology and guilt.
","'They said the black oil wouldn't come ashore. Well, it is ashore. It's here to stay and it's going to keep coming.' Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish.The worst ecological disaster in history provides us with one of the exciting American disaster films in history: Deepwater Horizon. Director Peter Berg so authentically recreates the oil-rig explosion and its aftermath that, if you see it in IMAX, you will feel as if you were there, and possibly cry over the loss that could have been avoided. Eleven deaths and countless others wounded, along with millions of gallons of crude are consequential.Mark Wahlberg (remember him as hero in Berg's Lone Survivor) gives another heroic performance, this time as Transocean chief electronic technician Mike Williams, more like Kurt Russell's (what is it with his mustaches?) usual disaster profile, who is here as skipper Jimmy Harrell. With an impressive supporting group, they give the feeling of ordinary people caught in unimaginable hell as Mother Nature explodes oil and methane to completely destroy the floating rig.The most interesting part of the film precedes the 2010 explosion off the coast of Louisiana: The representative administrators from BP are led by the usually bad-boy John Malkovich, playing Donald Vidrine, an official more interested in the bottom line than the humans who will end up on the ocean floor. The BP officials have let slide a crucial test of the cement supporting the rig, and subsequent events prove them wrong to avoid a test that would have cost the multi billion dollar corporation a pittance compared to the cost of disaster.While the opening of the film is filled with jargon-laced repartee among the crew and the usual homely scene between Mike and his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter (an impressive Stella Allen), the latter part of the film emphasizes Mike's heroics, important to the genre but hardly the point the film should be making. Deepwater Horizon should have in part been a cautionary tale about corporate greed and a wake-up call for safety upgrades. Maybe even a small emphasis on the lives of ordinary working citizens off the rig affected by the blast would have been in order.Actually the film shows Peter Berg a modern master of fire and mud with some lethal gas thrown in.

United 93," I'm better for it.
","It must have been challenging for Paul Greengrass to direct a film whose events are embedded in the collective memory but whose details, certainly for the doomed flight 93 on September 11, 2001, must be conjecture and politically supercharged when it comes to assigning the 'hero' label. That United 93, on its way from Newark to San Francisco, went down near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on its diversion to a target in D.C. we know; what happened during the flight is unknown except for cell phone and in- flight courtesy phones.On flight 93, it appears several men tried to overpower the hijackers; they failed because the plane smashed into Pennsylvania. The 'Let's roll' exhortation is understated in this version apparently to allow the story to tell itself entirely, not just as the mantra of a superhero. In fact, mitigating the fervid roll call of heroism among the passengers is the underlying truth that probably most of the heroic adrenaline came from the primal urge to survive rather than the altruism of saving lives on the ground.But aside from the inherent problem of accurately depicting the unknowable aboard the flight, it is certain that the air controllers were heroic when they tirelessly unraveled the mystery of errant planes (four were hijacked; three hit their targets) and doggedly fought ill-prepared FAA officials and military officers. That only four jet fighters could be scrambled in time to do any kind of preventive attacks on the air 'bombs' and that Pentagon officials didn't even tell pilots they were cleared by the president to bring down the commercial liners are facts depressing in themselves. That the passengers of flight 93 thwarted the hijackers' plan can be affirmed with joyful kudos to all aboard.Perversely, 9/11 attacks gave us the wakeup call that will last for centuries. Our lack of preparedness will never again be that high.Who will go to see Flight 93? Although it is a first-rate accounting of a consummate horror, I am not sure millions of people are yet ready to face the truth. I did, and I'm better for it.",Null,14,30,24 April 2006
It," How being scared can be so much fun!
","'I'm sorry. WHO invited Molly Ringwald?' Although It is not the comedy that quote would suggest, the film adaptation of Stephen King's story is rich with horror tropes and allegorical clichés; it is also a darn good horror flick. Now it might not scare the bejesus out of you, but it will satisfy your need to see what lies at the bottom of the well, and it's not pretty. Also, it will make you laugh.This hodgepodge of early teens calling themselves The Losers Club, all males except for a cute girl, Beverly (Sophia Lillis, who could pass for Ron Howard 's daughter), are caught up in a 1989 Reagan-era search for a mad clown, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who lives in the sewer and eats children. While that premise is rich enough with jump scares and telegraphing deaths, the more important themes of overcoming fears and working together to defeat evil are well presented if sometimes only through metaphor.For instance, the sequence with sheep being led to slaughter emphasizes the need to break away and express individuality. At the same time, some sheep-like following is necessary as only the group can defeat the evil. We all know what happens when in horror films someone leaves the protection of the fold.Nothing more expressed the angst of early teens than adults who don't listen to their kids or adults who prey on them, and not just a deranged clown because some dads here are downright bad in the way they treat their offspring. It does a great job showing the disturbing challenges of adolescence, not the least of which are their messy pubescent thoughts and pursuits. The film is, therefore, a mess, but a good one, because their lives are a mess of anxieties.Fear is the dominant motif, of clowns who seduce kids into the sewers to dads who stalk their daughters. No 13 year old is exempt, and even the male hero, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), has a stutter. Yet, if one is willing to overcome evil by banding with others, as the nerdy kids do against over-the-top bullies and rabid clowns, life can be tolerable and offer 27 peaceful years until the clown reappears and eats some more kids.By then our heroes will be adults, eaten buy life itself.

Hereditary," Good summer scare especially if you see your family in the proceedings.
","SPOILER: Newbie director Ari Aster has your attention: his Hereditary (which he also wrote), is a mash up of horror tropes that go from the creepy teen-age daughter to the creepy grandma, with immolations and beheadings to keep things interesting. Such a stew is a necessary plan of action because the focus of the plot is not apparent until the last 30 minutes or so, and those last minutes are burdened with too much exposition that should have been in the rest of the film.That ending takes the occult events since grandma's death and the accompanying horrors and gives them context. It is the most satisfactory part of the film, barely justified by the disparate set pieces before it, which could have fit in any other horror film and made as much sense. However, Hereditary still is chock full of skin crawling family shenanigans that should keep the genre fans engaged.The real horror here is the feeling that biological inheritance is a lock, and if the family is as weird as the Grahams, few of them if any will escape the consequences of the family's sins, from grandma on down. No one is more distraught than mother Annie (Toni Collette), who sees her 13 year old daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), get caught in the family atrocity mode, as well as her son, Peter (Alex Wolff), stronger than almost everyone else but growingly more vulnerable to the ghostly rumblings, even when he is in class. 
Mother Annie (Toni Collette) seems to carry all the guilt laid down by grandma. While Collette goes over the top, Essie Davis as the distraught mom Amelia in the Babadook is a model of restraint by comparison. Both moms are part of a growing body of horror films that reveal the anguish of being a mom with problematic children.Hereditary, as in the case of other A 24 productions like It Comes at Night and The Witch, is less about horror gore and more about the psychological terror of family caught in its biological fun house. Just seeing an incident or two of wacked-out action is enough to set the audience into fear mode of what more family bashing is in store.The Graham family lives in an impressively spacious modern home in the Pacific Northwest (filmed in Utah), with one of the large rooms the workshop of artist mom, who creates miniature dioramas, some scarily depicting their own home and horrible occurrences in family history. Aster and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski craft a not-so-much jump scare atmosphere as a slow-burning fear based mostly on the interior madness of the family.Hereditary is a good, if not great, summer scare to remind us that when it comes to family, we can offer just as much insanity as the best movie family.",Null,2,5,9 June 2018
Minority Report," Hey, it's summer-lighten up and enjoy what's good about a dark formula sci-fi film with an impressive pedigree.
","Spielberg, Cruise, Philip C. Dick-director, star, creator.  This is a heavenly group promising that the mediocre fare of this summer will be redeemed by a sci-fi thriller about an agency making arrests before crimes are committed.The intriguing premise, based on precognition theory crossed with some Sybil-like prediction powers by three `Precogs' from a Dick short story, is not given its potential in at least half the film.  The setup is stylistically attractive, a hybrid of the digital inventiveness of `The Matrix,' `A.I.,' and the coldness of Dick's `Blade Runner.' Cruise coordinates data about potential crimes on a giant screen like a symphony conductor in charge of a NASA launching. Visually Spielberg has the eerie futuristic world down right, even to the Orson-Welles-like lighting and classical and pop music punctuations.Then the cliches roll in like a thunderstorm, ruining the promising premise with predictable scenarios-Cruise is setup to be an object of his own Pre-Crime Division, a friend turns out to be an enemy, the bad guy is not bad, the race is on, etc. The climax and plot twist could have been seen all the way from the next solar system, and Max Von Sydow should seriously reconsider accepting parts that fulfill expectations from his previous roles.In this mixed bag of tricks are a couple of scenes truly worthy of Spielberg's brilliance, one when Cruise visits the elderly creator of precognition crime detection (Lois Smith of `The Pledge' and `Five Easy Pieces').  The strange garden she has created with its almost human plants well reflects the strange and dangerous world her creation has engendered.Cruise had a much more complex character in `Vanilla Sky,' demanding you pay close attention to details if you wished to make sense out of his troubled character's search for identity. In `Minority Report' plot and special effects rule. If star and director wish to cash in on this film, they ought to look with dread at other summer films like `Bourne Identity' and `Sum of All Fears,'  which are not likely to generate enough cash for future more artful films.Hey, it's summer-lighten up and enjoy what's good about a dark formula sci-fi film with an impressive pedigree.

Finding Neverland," Another entertaining attempt to make genius accessible to us all.
","In 1903 London it is hard to believe any artist besides Oscar Wilde could have energized the West End more than J.M. Barrie with his immortal 'Peter Pan.' Finding Neverland' attempts to tell how Barrie (Johnny Depp) was inspired through his relationship with widower Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four fatherless boys.The replication of London and its play-going society is as perfect as we've grown to expect; see, for instance, 'Being Julia,' which is also about the London stage and star Julia Lambert (Annette Bening), who blurs the line between her performances and her personal life. In a sense, that's what 'Neverland' addresses: Barrie creating magical escape for children but losing the magic in his marriage, believing his wife and Sylvia would ever be there for him. Also, both films attempt to deal with the isolation genius brings and the ironic truth that the more success art brings, the more distance from reality and humanity is required for the creation.Depp underplays Barrie to the extent that when he plays a pirate for the children, I longed for his swashbuckler in 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' Even when he is deeply involved with the children, who are his muse along with their mother, he seems to be holding back the energy Barrie must have had or that Depp certainly has.But enough sentimentality is loaded on to the last third of the film to sink the 'Titanic' without glacial help. Sylvia's deadly consumption lets Forster indulge his actors with pithy statements about death and its antidote, the imagination. The heartstrings are pulled harder than the ropes elevating Pan and the boys on the stage. The literal translation of the Davies kid's actions into those of Pan, Wendy, and friends lacks the imagination of the author himself.Depp remains today's most versatile actor, so when he underplays, as he does here, he is still interesting. 'Finding Neverland' is more engaging that his 'Secret Window,' where he also plays a writer troubled with his inspiration, and 'Neverland' this year joins 'De-Lovely'(Col Porter's life) as another entertaining attempt to make genius accessible to us all.",Null,0,0,19 November 2004
Detroit," Hyper-realistic, depressing, engrossing docudrama.
","'Sniper in the window.' National Guardsman, right before the window and the little girl were fired on.The Detroit racial riots of 1967 have often been described as a war zone, and that's what director Kathryn Bigelow has done in her docudrama Detroit. Just as in The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, she has taken strife-ridden history and recreated it on the screen to such a degree of terror realism, almost hyper-realism, that 'based on a true story' is too tame to do justice to her reenactment.That she is a Northern-California woman depicting a seminal black experience is both problematic and astonishing: 'What better way to use your white privilege than to undermine it, raise questions about it, leverage it on behalf of black and brown people who usually don't have a voice in the matter at all.' Bigelow The operative motif for me is the music hall, where, after riots were fomented by a gratuitous police raid of an unregistered black club, Martha and the Vandellas sing No Place to Hide and a young male foursome called The Dramatists wait to go on stage. The promise of the young group is shattered by police clearing the hall for safety's sake. The disintegration of social opportunity and the danger of modern racism is the heart of the unrest.The overly-long sequence at the Algiers Motel is the central violent piece, where black men and white women are rousted from the hotel, and three men are murdered by a rabid group of Detroit police with the National Guard acquiescing. The police's torture of these benign revelers, albeit one has shot a starter gun at the police from a window, looks as if the cops will eventually be exonerated of their crimes because of the riotous circumstances.More importantly, the next 50 years will be fraught with such white violence against blacks that we can all wonder what we have learned, if anything. Is racism just a part of our societal fabric? If it takes hundreds of years, equality will happen, but not 50 years out today.Bigelow and her Zero Dark Thirty collaborator writer Mark Boal, along with gifted cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, have created an unforgettable landscape of destruction and carnage right here in America. While some may complain that the up close, personal, and jiggly hand-held camera is annoying, none may criticize the realism Bigelow has created.Too real, and too possible that it may happen over and over again until we get this race thing right.",Null,1,11,7 August 2017
In Bruges," It'll send you to the Internet.
","'The Venice of the North . . .' (Bruges tourist information) I have been in Brussels and Amsterdam, and now thanks to Martin McDonagh's absurdist, existential, and comic film, I have been In Bruges. And, yes, thanks to the cinematography of Eigil Bryid, I am not only loving this European medieval city, with canals and glowing cathedrals, but I am also reminded of the dark shadows and intricate morality of the Third Man.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are hit men waiting days, like players in Beckett or Pinter plays, for orders about their next hit. For Ken, it is a chance to tour a glorious ancient city; for Ray it's a chance not to do that but rather watch a Belgian movie about dwarfs and hook up with the lovely girl who supplies drugs to the cast. Like two buddies from Patrice Leconte's Man on the Train, the boys couldn't be more different except for the deep well of feelings to emerge from an absurd situation.Reluctant as I am to comment on acting, I must confess to being won over by Farrell's sympathetic portrayal of a man/boy haunted by his first hit. Nor does Gleeson's Ken suffer by comparisonhe's tough but caring, willing to take a life or spare one. These guys are also straight out of David Mamet (think of Heist, Spartan, and House of Games)amoral and thoughtful, rude and poetic: Ken urges Ray to climb a medieval tower to look at 'the view'; Ray responds, 'Why do I have to climb up there to see down here? I'm already here.' Or when Ray says, 'If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't.' Perhaps Ray Fiennes Harry, the uber assassin, is more in the Mamet tradition with his repertoire of f-word variations.I am as moved by the existential sub theme as I am by the gallows-humor of these lost souls. As in the Crying Game (in which there is also a skin head former boyfriend and arguable orientations in love and murder), being comfortable in the game of murder is not easy, especially for those who like people a bit too much to be in the business and are uncertain about their identities when it comes to life, love, and death.If for nothing else, In Bruges will send you to the internet for the best travel deal to Belgium.

Friday Night Lights," It's all about winning.
","For those of us who endure the suffocating zeal of Ohio State football fans or hear about the football obsession of small-town Massillon, Ohio, 'Friday Night Lights' is more of the same. Odessa, Texas, has little else but high school football given the poor economic times of 1988 and the barren world of remote Texas. But it's a true story filled with a game that defines the future of its players and the town, for whom there is little else.Billy Bob Thornton plays Gary Gaines, coach of the Permian Panthers, in an adaptation of a best-selling book by H.G. Bissinger about high school football ('The Devil's Own'). The Panthers have moved into the semifinals of the state championship but without their best player Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). Thornton underplays Gaines, with a few moments excepted where he berates his team. (The town, however, takes on the role of the rabid coach.)The stereotypically abusive dad, a former state champion who won't accept anything short of perfection from his son, is complemented by the single mom who studies plays with her son but gives unconditional love.At one moment, however, Gaines delivers the usual pep talk in a most unusual tone-one of conciliation and harmony, ascribing perfection to doing all you can for your team so that you can look each one in the eye with love. It's not about winning, he says, and I believe him for the sentiment and the powerful delivery of the Oscar-winning Thornton.The cinematography is too jumpy and close for me for most of the film although those who know this vicious contact sport swear it gives an authentic sense of the up close and personal linemen and battered running backs. The music is harsh at times, maybe even too dominating.Whether or not this is how the final game of the championship was played is less important than the insights the film reinforces. No one who loses can shake the feeling of personal inadequacy, no one whose livelihood depends on winning can have respite from fickle fans, and athletes who don't study will find themselves returning to towns like Odessa to retell their football story like the Ancient Mariner.In 'Miracle' (2004) USA veteran hockey coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) knows it's not just a game, as his enduring wife (Patricia Clarkson) reminds him in the hours when he is most absorbed in game films and firings and neglecting his family. In fact, 'Miracle' is about this remarkable coach's vision that only the most grueling practice will prepare them for the best team in the world. He purposely at one point verbally beats them up.The two films show different coaching styles but the same love of a tough game where its winners take abuse and admiration in equal measure. It's the true believers in the game who best define the drama: 'I think that I would still rather score a touchdown than make love to the prettiest girl in the United States.'

Rocketman," Enjoyable, brilliant biopic of one of Rock's icons.
","'And I think it's gonna be a long, long time. Till touch down brings me round again to find, I'm not the man they think I am at home. Oh no no no, I'm a rocketman!' Elton John (Taron Egerton)Elton John's remarkable removal from reality while he really defines a new rock performance style in the late '60's expresses in 'Rocketman' the tension between performance dynamism and the formulaic loneliness fame and success bring to a legend. Taron Egerton's Elton is every bit as good as, if not better than, Remi Malik's Freddie in Bohemian Rhapsody. Egerton sings with his own voice, not imitating Elton but recalling his genius while retaining Egerton's own distinctive sound-recollection not ompersonation.Besides a career-defining role for Egerton, the biopic approaches the subject matter not so much historically as impressionistically, where each scene illuminates a character trait or moment that comments more on the human condition than the showbiz at hand. Elton's struggle with his sexual identity and a legion of typical 70's drugs like alcohol and cocaine highlight the difficulty any artist might have overcoming a culture of excess. So 70's, so rock 'n roll.Director Dexter Fletcher brilliantly finished Bohemian Rhapsody after Bryan Singer's departure, and in so doing prepared to one-up himself with an Elton John more nuanced than Malik's Freddie. Fletcher and writer Lee Hall also make the standard Elton John repertoire express the moment rather than just provide a delightful chronological feast. The montage-like presentation, with the resonating emotion and psychological exposure, evokes the best of Baz Luhrmann, who never found a song that didn't fit a true emotion as in the memorable Moulin Rouge.Rocketman is an impressionistic fantasy about the growth of Elton with an outstanding central performance, iconic songs, and a formulaic but not any less profound arc from glory to debasement and back again. Come to think of it, the ancient Greeks had that dramatic formula down so well that their drama is fresh even today.Rocketman shows that Elton's signature flamboyance becomes a natural part of his genius: 'Don't you want to just sing without this ridiculous paraphernalia?'

A Star Is Born," A fine addition to the Star is Born canon.
","'Maybe it's time to let the old ways die.' Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper)After three previous versions at A Star is Born, director/co-writer/star Bradley Cooper has added a version worthy of the best of them. Cooper's Jack is a charismatic rocker whose flaw is substance abuse, and Lady Gaga's singer/songwriter, Ally, is an ingenuous talent who remains innocent through all the shenanigans required to be a star, not born but made. Her opening number strutting on a bar singing La Vie en Rose clarifies why Jack fell for her immediately and why she is headed to glory. As the opening lyric might suggest, they are change agents for each other, not always in easy transitions.Although the two first movies were about Hollywood, and the dangers of stardom we all knew even in 1937 and 1954, then Streisand's (1976) and Cooper's are all music, with Cooper's superior take a lived-in rock atmosphere. In that way, Cooper's is even better than Almost Famous. Streisand and Kristoferson seem to exist for Streisand where Cooper's couple is deeply in love but not strong enough to save Jack.
Although I tire of Jack's incessant drinking, a tedium to watch after a few minutes, I accept it as the tragic element of a cliched story about the glory and the hell of the biz. Both Cooper and Gaga sing with such depth of feeling it is hard not to shed a tear at the sad outcome.The film is also strong about the challenges of that road to stardom, uncompromising as it displays the forces changing Ally from a wholesome natural singer to a manufactured pop singer and marginalize Jack for being a substance abuser and too old. The resonance today with the #MeToo emphasis on male domination is only too obvious. However, Cooper transforms Maine into a loving, not jealous lover.

Danny Dietz's (Emile Hirsch) fatherWe know from the beginning and the title, Lone Survivor, that Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) is the only one to make it out from ill-fated Afghanistan mission, Operation Redwings, in 2005. Three of the four SEALs die in an ambush. Knowing how it will turn out does not diminish the impact of this powerful docudrama, in which the ambiguities and allegiances of that conflict are knowingly and realistically disclosed.Sure, some of the clichés from WWII combat movies are still alive and kicking such as the obligatory back stories about families, loves, and horses, all laid out in the first half hour to add the human touch. The film succeeds in connecting us, perhaps because it does not overdo the sentimentality or the background music. The scenes of SEAL training are also a part of the genre but appropriate for verifying the four as fighting machines.When Lone Survivor gets to the mission to eventually assassinate the infamous Taliban leader Ahmad Shahd, it is meticulous with the details of the special-forces movements and machinery. When the ambush of the SEALs begins in full, the gradual degradation of the situation for the vastly outnumbered Seals seems authentic if not overdone in the large number of Afghans the SEALs kill.The interesting question about this type of war film is whether or not it's all about the stars who play the real-life heroes. Although Mark Wahlberg can't hide his cinematic persona, his role is much more than preening because his part shows best the need for a brotherhood to develop to survive in the field. Wahlberg succeeds making us sympathize with him as a caring soldier, not just a movie star.At the early planning stage, Matt 'Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster) remarks there are 'a lot of moving parts' to the military planning. With the failure of communications and Apache helicopter backup, his comment is a death knell, and not just because of the rugged terrain (New Mexico) or unreliable locals. As a metaphor for the arguable merits of the Afghanistan invasion, Lone Survivor completes its mission. As a recruitment vehicle for Navy SEALs, not so much. It's too rough out there.",Null,3,8,8 January 2014
Wind River," Terrific locale, fascinating crime.
","'Luck don't live out here.' Cory (Jeremy Renner)'Out here' is somewhere outside of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and outside of the normal advantages of a murder investigation in a big city and inside the Wind River Indian reservation. The Fargo-like white snow of writer/director Taylor Sheridan's smart and enjoyable Wind River is as always menacing as it joins pure white innocence with dark crime.Unlike Fargo, no laughs enter this dialogue, just the single-minded will to survive in a hostile land for everyone and a hard life for the Native Americans. A young girl has been raped and murdered, and Cory is the wildlife service's tracker, who joins with FBI agent Jane (Elizabeth Olsen) to solve the crime. Although the intricacies of the crime are simple when contrasted with some much bigger-budgeted thrillers, it has going for it atmosphere and acting, especially Renner's laconic and intuitive local, whose daughter was killed in a similar manner. The sense of place is just as strong (credit DP Ben Richardson with breathtaking views of mountains and trails). Unfortunately, the later Mexican standoff among police officers doesn't fit with the serious nature of the film as a whole (it becomes comedy-like when it reminds you of Tarantino with its shouting and abandon). Then there's the villain—another almost comic touch, and clichéd when contrasted with the rest of the original material. Too bad because Sheridan had done so much original work already as he did throughout Hell or High Water.Along with unsophisticated forensics comes commentary on reservation life such as boredom that breeds crime, lack of support from government, and few opportunities to break free of the poverty. An epilogue states there are no stats for lost reservation women. In other words, this thriller is after bigger game than lions who devour sheep and men who murder.Wind River shows people's grit in the face of hardship and their will to survive. Throw in a murder or two, and that life is stripped to its bone in a world that can't be fictionalized. This is reality, Wyoming-style.",Null,2,6,21 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," Unevenly funny satire about a decidely unfunny Russia.
","Moscow 1953 was good for notorious butcher/dictator Josef Stalin: He was completing the eradication of 20 million Soviets and so powerful that he could ask for a classical recording of a Mozart concert that required the orchestra, audience, and pianist to repeat the performance. Armando Iannucci's Soviet low-brow satire, The Death of Stalin, takes black comedy from his Veep territory to uncompromising, humorous honesty about ambition with the weight of history behind it.Wisecracking acting general secretary and future premier Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) works before and after Stalin's (Adrian McLoughlin) death to ensure his ascendency to the top spot. Making certain security head Lavrently Beria is not going to be the new Stalin is just one of the successes for the conspiring Khrushchev, who could be mistaken for a Marx brother in one of their zany comedies. This adaptation of Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin's graphic novel is a wild foray into grim post-WWII politics. At times, Buscemi is the consummate comedic actor, slightly underplaying while yet milking the laughs. When every other word is an f bomb, not so much. Jeffrey Tambor as interim premier Melankov is in the same spot-funny when he's not way over the top silly and clueless. Former Monty Python clown, Michael Palin, is wasted as foreign affairs minister Vyacheslav Molotov; Palin's presence promises more zany than actually happens. Mostly the Stalin acolytes act like they are school kids putting on a hapless comedy as they jockey for the top spot.Not nearly as witty as Iannucci's The Loop, The Death of Stalin is still unevenly funny. Russian history in a condensed version is compelling when you consider the long tenure of Vladimir Putin and the rumors that float about his ruthlessness. Some things never change, comedy or not.

I'm Not There," 'I'm not the real Bob Dylan.'
","I'm Not There 'Everybody knows I'm not a folk singer.' So claims Bob Dylan by one of the six interpreters of his persona in Todd Haynes' stylistic, impressionistic I'm not There. This quote clarifies what isn't in this biopic, the real Bob Dylan; the title gives a clue to the imprecise biography but suggests the intriguing format in which disparate actors, from Heath Ledger on one end to Cate Blanchett on the other, play at different times in his life a person never called Bob Dylan.There's plenty to enjoy, for instance Alan Ginsberg asking a statue of crucified Christ, 'Why don't you do your early stuff?' Or Blanchett's spot on imitation of the late-60's rocker with curly hair and epigrammatic responses. Although she gets closest to the Dylan I remember, I figured out that I don't know the troubadour any better now than I did before the film. But, then, why should IWho really knew Elvis? The universal appeal of these icons like Dylan is that they appeal to something a little different in each generation and maybe each person; with such wide-ranging influence, that they remain inscrutable is a natural concomitant to the impression on each soul.Because Dylan is a true shape shifter, from protester par excellence to current X-M Radio disc jockey (not in the film), Haynes has done an inventive turn on a genre that could use his renovation. Yes, I would like to know the inner workings of genius, but these biographies rarely if ever give it to me, so Haynes' wildly interpreting, right up to an outrageous parallel to Billy the Kid (Richard Gere), satisfies my inclination to the impressionistic and lack of historical fact retention. The film is really an abstraction of feeling that militates against knowing the subject at all. But then, who knows anything about Dylan but his style anyway?

Star Trek," Out of this world
","'I like this ship! It's exciting!' Scotty (Simon Pegg)Producer/Director J.J. Abrams has gone where few men have gone before him—a sequel better than the original. The new Star Trek takes characters and motifs from its past, mixes up the time track, and accurately shows the enduring Kirk, Spock, and Bones in their wild days before they actually take over the decades-old franchise. For Kirk and Bones, dark humor is and always was their drug of choice.The centerfold of this benign space porn is blue-eyed James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), swashbuckling captain-to-be of the USS Enterprise. What remains consistent and is emphasized this time around is his brilliance and irreverence, a leader willing to take chances with an almost flawless gut-instinct. Contrary to Spock's (Zachary Quinto) righteous logic, Kirk's instinct tells him to pursue Romulan baddie, Nero (Eric Bana), rather than regroup with federation gunships as Nero hastily moves to Earth's destruction.The acting is just right for the franchise tradition, right down to Chekov (Anton Yelchin) having a loud, extreme Russian accent, amped up from Walter Koenig's original. Abrams lets Yelchin go over the top, and for that extreme I was annoyed.Along the way Kirk has more adventures than James Bond on his best day, for me a few too many activities because of my interest in character development over action. But I get a bit of that development as I watch Spock struggle with his half-human emotions while Kirk abandons the rational in favor of the romantic.The emphasis on leadership in this Star Trek is much more successful than ever before because we can see the importance of nature and nurture in both Kirk and Spock during their formative years. Kirk comes from a father who in the first hour of his command gives up his life for hundreds on his vessel in an act of heroism that defines the Kirkean mojo of romantic courage coupled with strategic genius.As for Spock, this is what he says and who he is: 'Fear is necessary for command.'",Null,1,12,5 May 2009
Fury," Pitt for president! Here's real leadership under duress.
","'Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.' Wardaddy (Brad Pitt)And violent Fury is, and old-fashioned WWII war story about the commander Don 'Wardaddy' Collier of a Sherman tank, his crew, and a retinue of tanks, all heroically facing superior German tanks with their ability to destroy Shermans at will. The story is captivating, the soldiers believable, and the heroics inevitably sad. Pitt's similar role, however, in Inglorious Basterds as a Nazi hunter, was far more nuanced, and frankly, directed by the genius Quentin Tarantino. David Ayer's work in other men facing murderous times is still not competition for the sardonic Tarantino.Many war stories tropes are here, such as the young recruit who needs seasoning (Norman, played by Logan Lerman) and the scruffy crew of diverse characters: the outwardly gruff master sergeant (Pitt); the inebriated Mexican, Trina (Michael Pena); the bible- bookworm-killer Gordon (Shia LeBeouf); and the hardened tough guy Grady (Jon Bernthal)--stereotypes all but not overly so. This film is superior to George Clooney's The Monuments Men as the jokes are quiet, not taking away from the grim reality, and the incidents are coherent with the overall plot, not set pieces existing for effect rather than complement. That Pitt and Clooney are best buddies and recently married to accomplished women makes for a kinder comparison. Pitt, with his boffo performances in Benjamin Button and Moneyball and this one, is jumping ahead of his friend in the acting category but still needs to direct to compete overall. As the four tanks dwindle down to just Fury (the name painted on Wardaddy's tank), the intense warfare is mitigate only by a brief encounter between Wardaddy and Norman and two German women hiding in their apartment. What happens is not exactly what you'd expect and more illuminating about the tank's crew than you'd expect. Ayer expertly underplays this episode as he shows a deft hand at even quiet, non warlike moments.Norman will grow too fast for belief with each episode (it is only one day, after all) and Wardaddy's terse advice on matters relating to sentiment, survival, and slaughter: 'It will end, soon. But before it does, a lot more people have to die.' Exceptional heroics surface while everyone knows the German will surrender soon but remain steadfast with respect to their orders to stop the enemy. Although the final scene is hard to believe (at least 300 SS troops versus the tank crew?), the film is not compromised, for we are surely aware that this is not a good war, and war is hell.",Null,4,11,17 October 2014
Train to Busan," This train is delightfully out of control.
","'I'll take you to mom no matter what.' Seok Woo (Yoo Gong)This workaholic father, Seok Woo, doesn't realize the ramifications of 'no matter what.' South Korean zombie thriller and box-office phenomenon Train to Busan speeds him and daughter, Soo-an (Soo-an Kim), from Seoul like the titular conveyance through cars and society in a way reminiscent of Snowpiercer. The conceit works well because it can give ample thrills and jump scares while taking a figurative run through society from one car to another.Train to Busan is much more than the sum of the frenetic zombie hordes that terrorize the train in scarily multiplying numbers. It is also about the community joining forces to combat crime, workers facing down management, commoners disdaining government in general, and distracted parents. Director/writer Sang-ho Yeon navigates between the terror and the commentary with effective timing, never letting the flaming story erase the sociological implications, which sometimes are heavy handed.While cinematographer Lee Hyung-deok does first-rate work on the mise en scene (from macro shots of the train and stampeding zombies to action in narrow on-board bathrooms), and editor Yang Jin-mo keeps the story moving and understandable, Train is also about relationships. Although several of the good characters do not make it to the station, those who do are representative of the hope humanity must have in its darkest times. Along the way we do have to experience the silly, cartoonish characterization of the cowardly bus-company executive Yong-Suk (Kim Eui-sung). He could have been a zombie.I can't be sure how much of the South Korean audience embraced the implications of capitalism lying underneath the speeding-train motif. What I know is that for a critic who usually avoids zombie films unless they are humorous satires, I enjoyed Train to Busan as a multi-layered entertainment to appeal to just about anyone who likes to be thrilled by first-rate cinematography, a wild-ass story, and some heady thoughts along the way.",Null,10,24,7 October 2016
Darkest Hour," Stunning docudrama with an Oscar-worthy lead.
","'He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.' Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane)What a joy to see this superior docudrama, Darkest Hour, exalt language by championing Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman). Although I have spent my career cavorting with words, this film does in two hours what I had always believed: Words can win wars.Although at this point I can see no other competition for the Oscar than Gary Oldman, you may not believe me because you can't recognize him in his role. He does lose himself playing Churchill, not just because of the fat prosthetics, the glasses, and the cigar, but because he channels Churchill's indomitable spirit and endearing flaws with a perfection rarely seen this side of Daniel Day-Lewis.For the complete historical experience, see Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk as a companion, for Churchill's success of the 300,000 soldier-rescue/retreat at Dunkirk made Churchill's legacy and changed the war to a losing proposition for the Nazis, notwithstanding their withering superiority on the land and in the air. 
What makes this doc so memorable is the revelation of Churchill's flaws as well as his genius. He wavers in acceptance of Chamberlain and Halifax's proposals to capitulate to Herr Hitler, yet he can be persuaded by the populace's 'never' to give in to them as he rides the tube to listen to their heroism first hand.Besides the tour de force performance, Darkest Hour has other splendid moments such as the nose-to-nose confrontations between Mrs. Churchill (Kristin Scott Thomas) and the prime minister. Additionally, director Joe Wright employs his well-known camera acrobatics to keep interest and relay meaning (e.g., the opening camera shot from the ceiling of the House to a close-up of the speaker's left side is ominous about the lofty proceedings and their roots in humanity, and his street-tracking shots are several and realistic.Here's a docudrama to make you weep as you watch real-life heroes struggle in a battle of the mind, and oh, yes, words.",Null,1,6,23 December 2017
Monster," Two superlatives apply to writer/director Patty Jenkins' `Monster': best actress and grimmest film of 2003.
","Two superlatives apply to writer/director Patty Jenkins' `Monster': best actress and grimmest film of 2003. Charlize Theron (`The Italian Job') transformed physically (30 pounds and prominent prosthetic teeth) and mentally (Theron not for a second leaves her character) into serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron is every reason to see this account of an abused, disturbed hooker turned murderer (convicted in 1992 of at least 6 murders, one probably in self defense); nothing else in the film is unusual storytelling or acting, not even graphically as compelling as this sure Oscar nominee. She embodies Brendan Francis's description of prostitutes as `women of action. Talk is not their stock in trade.'The grimness of the film comes directly out of the subject matter: a story about a prostitute without Julia Roberts in the lead or a benign twist just won't keep an American audience's attention, especially if there is more graphic display in a current teenage slasher flick. So the audience for `Monster' is likely to squirm at the least or be revolted at Aileen's rough persona and meaningless life, filmed in dark tones with little color, not even much red blood. The intellectual satisfaction of understanding how this murderer got into a violent mess cannot mitigate the desire to leave the theater the way you would leave a smoky bar because you were stuck next to a sweaty biker dude with garish tattoos and a foul mouth.Christina Ricci (`The Ice Storm') plays Aileen's 18-year-old Ohio lesbian friend, Selby, in such a mysterious way as to make it uncertain if she is acting well or not at all. Selby eventually testifies against Aileen, but even during their most passionate moments as lovers, where Aileen acts out the male, protective role, Selby's motivation for her attraction to Aileen is unclear and hardly believable given the physical, social, and emotional distance between the two.Theron trumps easily last year's Oscar winner Nicole Kidman in `The Hours,' where her nose could hardly compete with Theron's entire body.  Kidman's understated Virginia Woolf required much less range than Theron's sneering, fleshy, manic Aileen Wuornos. Closest to Theron's triumph is Hillary Swank's 1999 Oscar winning performance as Teena Brandon turned Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry, ` another tragic story of a sexual misfit and murder. Though Swank's performance required a more refined protagonist than Theron's, both actresses made the bizarre believable.Naomi Watts in `21 grams' and Patricia Clarkson in `Station Agent' and `Pieces of April' are worthy of 2003 Oscar nominations. They will have to wait, however, until another year, for this one belongs to Charlize Theron, an actress so attractive in `Cider House Rules' that I thought she would never compromise her blonde, cherry-lipped supremacy.  She did, and she will win for that surrender.",Null,1,2,16 January 2004
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious
","'You probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-takin' business; we in the killin' Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin'.' Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) Raine pretty much summarizes the story of Inglourious Basterds as Quentin Tarantino concocted it: A WWII assassin crew headed by Raine (Pitt's southern accent is overcooked but impressively true to the Tarantino style). As a matter of fact, I like to think of this anti-Nazi/ SS film as showcasing the director's own SS: style and swagger.Working the famous Dirty Dozen assassin idea with his usual homage attitude, Tarantino adds his cinema obsession as a deadly motif occupying much of the movie. This is the director as we know him--wisecracking (see the opening quote), allusive, irreverent, outrageous (he does play with the outcome of the war), not with the originality of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, but with the inventiveness of Mel Brooks' Springtime for Hitler sequence in The Producers.But fewer laughs, although I enjoy pulpy ones like this from Raine: 'If you ever wanna eat a Sauerkraut sandwich again take your Wiener Schnitzel lickin' finger and point out on this map what I wanna know.'.Tarantino (like any maturing auteur, it becomes his film rather than its title) breaks his own mold by telling a linear story about the assassins and their final solution; we don't even witness the ascendancy of the Basterds, just their beginning in 1941 and their maturation in 1944. Additionally, more than one scene, for instance the opening Nazi visitation to a French farm and a bistro party, are much longer than other scenes I remember from his canon.Yet, they pass quickly enough, so adept is the director at building tension with climax certain in the near future. Perhaps this lingering is evidence of his willingness to let narrative take over rather than quirkiness or film reference (he was, after all, a notoriously knowledgeable video store clerk).Although other Tarantino films will long be remembered after this successful WWII satire is short-listed, few will be as close to mainstream thriller while staying far outside the restrictive conventions. It is one of the best movies this summer, standing next to Katherine Bigelow's Hurt Locker by saying something important about war and entertaining at the same time.Their 'business is a-boomin'.'",Null,5,13,10 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Some of the original's playfulness and plenty of Felicity Jones!
","'We have hope. Rebellions are built on hope!' Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones)Rebellion and hope. So goes the theme of the entertaining first Star Wars anthology story (not about Luke Skywalker and his immediate family), Rogue One. Jyn and Cassian (Diego Luna) are the swashbuckling leads, determined to lead a rebellion against The Empire. Hey, it's before the 1977 depiction, so all you need to grab is the fighting-mad vibe and wait for the grand entrance of Darth Vader and the impressive redo of the deceased Peter Cushing.Is it as good as the original? No. Is it better than most of the sequels/prequels? Yes. Although it lacks the vibrant mischief and jokey immaturity of the original, Director Gareth Edwards has the sacrifice and determination against domination down pat.Like Princess Leia, Jyn carries the feminist torch with a grace and petulance that makes you care. Cassian less so as he makes sure the voyages are successful and Jyn reconciles with her dad, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen), whose employment by the bad guys makes him suspect.The adventure serves, also, to answer nagging geek questions such as why the Death Star could so easily be breached. No further details from me because this is a fantasy adventure that thrives on surprises.Sufficed to say, Rogue is a story of good people fighting the good fight against the powerful forces of evil that seek to trod down the already downtrodden. The Empire could just as easily be the Syrian government, an African repressive nation, Russia, North Korea, or any despotic leader who fools his people to believe he really cares about them.The common denominator is the rebels, who always seem poor in belongings and arms, but whose will is selflessly focused on freedom with the accompanying ultimate sacrifice frequently exacted. Star Wars hit the right notes in the 20th century at a time when Viet Nam had spent our outrage so that anger was in danger of being dissipated by a surfeit of questionable wars.While Rogue suffers from lack of the lighthearted carelessness of Harrison Ford and the charming dorkiness of Carrie Fisher, leave it to this franchise to keep us focused on the sacrifices we must make and the hope we must nurture to be a society of equals.

Captain Marvel," Larson and Jackson are the real heroes of a this superhero origin story.
","Oscar-winning Brie Larson as noble Kree commando Carol Danvers makes a difference. Her cool indifference to showing off or overacting makes her a welcome addition to the Marvel Comic Universe. The adventure itself is not as original as the character/actor because it slavishly follows the Marvel/Super Power formulas (especially kapow and more kapow). It has, however, the first MCU female super-hero lead and a female as co-director and writer.It is not, lamentably, the cultural change agent that Black Panther has been. Captain Marvel is modest in ambition and scope. But fun anyway, especially in just another fight scene where No Doubt's 'Just a Girl' places it right in the '90's and gives juice to the feminist theme.Danvers initially fights for the empire against the reptilian Skrulls, who are shape shifters and terrorists to be stopped from taking over the universe. Carol is captured but escapes to earth, 1995, where she joins with S.H.I.E.L.D. operative Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, de-aged to digital perfection; Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson not so much) to search for her past (she has amnesia from some high-powered alien stuff I better not try to explain), the source of her powers and Skrulls.Also dealing with Kree leader Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) taxes Carol even more than Fury. In say a grunge chic, girl power '90's way, Larson and Jackson would do fine with a buddy film where they can exchange barbs like screwball comedy leads or just action characters of the 1990's.Nothing really new here for a super-hero film: lots of fights, lightning-like weapons, wise cracks, and villains you can spot a galaxy away, even if they shape shift. It's the wholesome dignity and ironic awareness of Carol that alters the formula to a more human and reasonably wicked evil without hammering away both for her feminism and genuine love of humanity.Captain Marvel is an entertaining super-hero flick with cartoonish characters and absurd setups. However, that heroine is worth seeing so you can fit her more nicely into the next chapter of the Avengers and witness a new type of hero that takes a reasoned approach to absurdity.

Coraline," There's no place like home.
","If Edward Gorey's American Gothic could be married to Tim Burton's ghoulishness, then what would emerge would be Caroline, a film with the demanding psychology of Neil Gaiman's prose married to the wild imagination of James and the Giant Peach's convoluted film director, Henry Selick.Yes, 3-D-stop animation Coraline is not for everyone, but aficionados of the eccentric should love the complicated story of a young girl, Caroline Jones (Dakota Fanning) thrust Alice-in-Wonderland style into a parallel universe where the mother ( Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) she might have thought she wanted are nightmarish knockoffs she needs to run from.Although the film shows how Caroline, and by extension all children, must have wit and courage to fight the forces of evil, it also emphasizes the need to accept the eccentricities and remoteness of nerdy, bright parents who may have their own demons to fight before the end of the day. The Wizard of Oz in spirit influences this film with the parallel universe motif of characters patterned out of real life and the universal message about the goodness of going home.This sometimes macabre and challenging animation is mostly not for children and a puzzler for adults who may not want to be challenged at a time when they struggle with financial monsters threatening their real homes.",Null,7,15,6 February 2009
This Is the End," Amusing summer fare
","Jonah Hill: 'This is no dream!

Soon the Apocalypse is upon them as they struggle with some impressive monsters to survive.The laughs are vulgar, sometimes sexual, sometimes scatological, and sometimes funny. Otherwise it seems like a movie made by guys who have made it and think we will enjoy them hanging out and being amusing during the end of the world. In other words, although they are not funny most of the time, because of their celebrity we should consider them funny all of the time. The narcissism we have come to suspect of successful Hollywood actors is both a source of the film's humor and its satire. The joke, of course, is on us because we have paid well to see them act like adolescents.The horror film sequences are not bad graphically and dramatically, with less humor than in the quieter parts such as when Rogen and Baruchel ride from the airport reminding me of Jerry Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. Although I have to admit Jonah Hill as a green-eyed, liquid spewing Exorcist knock off is funny enough if you just consider his many schlubby roles. During his exorcism, this exchange is mildly humorous: Jay Baruchel: 'The power of Christ compels you!' Jonah Hill: 'Guess what? It's not that compelling.' I'd say for a tepid comedic summer, This is the End ranks above Hangover III and below The Internship. You won't split a gut over it, but you will not waste your money either.

","'If you could make God bleed, people will cease to believe in Him.' Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke)It's apt to say Iron Man 2 is bleeding, but we know it won't be money. Rather it is that lifeblood of originality in story and dialogue characteristic of the original Marvel comic adaptation absent here. Remaining are pyrotechnics and gymnastics worthy of straight-to-video productions. I'm being sardonic. Obviously, the effects are going to be first-rate; it's just that the story is so burdened with sub plots that the original story seems now to be minimalist with its dramatic emphasis on character development and relationships rather than quips and effects.It is mostly visual mayhem while Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) keeps the government at bay as it tries to co-opt his invention and Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) challenges Iron Man with some very electric strategy. No less a threat is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), an industrialist wimp with the old domination ambitions accompanied by an unhealthy dislike for the likable Stark.The limitations are plentiful: very few lines for Rourke, an Oscar winner who deserves more than a few Russian words, several grunts, and silver teeth. The plot has too many strands and too few appearances of Iron Man. Perhaps just as disappointing is the underuse of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, whose Catwoman-like costume demands more eye time and whose acting chops, like Rourke's, probably lie in the editing trash bin.The relationship between Stark and talented assistant Pepper Potts goes to a new level, not a welcome development for this minimalist reviewer who prefers the cool of a professional relationship to a second-rate passion.

Two for the Money," An unusually rich and realistic film.
","'There are two great pleasures in gambling: that of winning and that of losing.' French proverb That all gamblers are losers we learn among other insights about betting in Two for the Money.If you want to see Al Pacino go over the top as Walter, the head of powerful football game 'pick' empire, who hires former quarterback and 1-900 small-time betting success Brandon (Matthew Matthew McConaughey) to join him in big-time picking for clients who are serious losers, you won't see it. But you will see three accomplished actors, Pacino. McConaughey, and Rene Russo (as Walter's wife) live in their roles the way Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, and Betty Davis, to name only three of the old timers, inhabited their roles and threw them in your face.If you wonder why rich people risk their fortunes on betting, this is the film to see; if you wonder about Hollywood's ability to depict a real marriage of two people who love each other despite the cataclysmic atmosphere of his profession, then become a believer by seeing an unusually rich and realistic film.The artistic unity is unusual. The notion of truthfully saying you're sorry is introduced in a tough guy scene, and then re-prised with Walter and his wife. Truth seems endangered in one scene then uncovered to be authentic in another (this pattern happens several times). Family values override money and ambition for the three major players; in Brandon's case, it becomes a matter of figuratively 'Who's your father' while in Walter's it's 'Who'll be your son?' (Chinese proverb: 'At the gambling table, there are no fathers and sons.') The extreme fitness of Brandon counterpoints the weak heart of Walter, whose exercise is only making money. The heart is figurative as well as it becomes the final arbiter of happiness.The film is good enough to recall other successful works of art: For instance, the camera tracks through the 'pick parlor' with its banks of computers recalling 'Wall Street' and Michael Douglas's similar role to Pacino's; the shouting, manipulating sales operatives recall the real estate agents in 'Glengary Glen Ross.' The supercharged sports atmosphere is reminiscent of 'Jerry Maguire' as is Cruise's vulnerable hotshot a template for McConaughey's.McConaughey fulfills his promise as a major star in a role seemingly made for him.

The implausibility of most horror films is built in; the genius of the filmmakers is to make us believe anyway.Unbelievable, yes, ludicrous no, for it speaks even in its grand setups of human vulnerability and the capricious power of Mother Nature. Although 28 Days had a minimalist approach, fewer zombies and more good guys, WWZ has a focus on hero Gerry with close-ups aplenty—but then it's Brad Pitt, who was born to be photographed.The zombie tropes are all there if you're checking: the hero coming out of retirement, the loving family he has to leave to save the world, the unreal transformation of millions into undead monsters, the good guy bitten, and so on. Yet director Marc Foster has assembled the best looking zombie horde to complement his star's good looks. Foster has also depicted thousands of zombies climbing and being shot down in vast groups, and image I have not encountered except in films about Nazi atrocities.The almost two hours are as fast paced as the virus—nary a moment of peace—from transporting Gerry and his family to various safe spots to running from the legions of zombies to finally a relatively quiet World Health Organization lab, where the creatures are ready to stop Gerry from finding their weakness and producing an antidote. The allegorical implications of HIV or chemical warfare are there if you want them. Otherwise, it's just an enjoyable ride along the suspense express.However, I have to admit the pandemic has a ring of truth to it , as if Ma Nature had decide another Black Plague would be good to get the population to reasonable size. For that scenario, see Dan Brown's Inferno. For nothing more than edge-of-your seat thrills, World War Z will do for a good old-fashioned adrenaline rush.",Null,9,25,20 June 2013
Passengers," A pleasant sci-fi that suggests more than it broadcasts.
","'You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are.' Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence)Where they are in Passengers is almost to the end of years of suspended animation getting to a planet that will receive a second settlement of 5,000 travelers. The real interest of this pleasant and interesting sci-fi is in the romance of two travelers awakening too soon from their animation (Aurora, played by Jennifer Lawrence, and Jim by Chris Pratt).After the audience struggles with his arguably unethical decision to awaken her, the usual sci-fi tropes kick in about the strategies to avoid boredom, to avoid damage to the ship, and to avoid romantic complications. Of course, one look at the out-of-this-world -attractive principals, and you know the romantic part will be a certainty.The more interesting challenge of beating boredom for 90 or so years is the decisions that determine how the years will go, such as constantly assessing the outcome and working to subvert it by taking over command of the self-propelling ship. Along the way the two befriend an android bartender, Arthur, played smoothly and ingratiatingly by so-cool Michael Sheen, confirming the intent of the film to scrutinize humanity in a microcosm rather than technology. Even the bot has human-like attributes.Yes, the movie may rely too heavily on the romance, as some critics have pointed out, ignoring the rich thematic possibilities of monogamy. Because the heroes rely on themselves completely, a case seems also to be made by writer Jon Spaihts for the virtue of a couple's isolation in the pursuit of happiness. These possibilities are my own speculation because the film itself does not explore them except by inference. Regardless, anyone appreciating the allegories of 2001 and Twilight Zone will be delighted by the rich possibilities of Passengers, albeit with a little work to extract the meanings:'Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed.' ― Stanisław Lem, Solaris",Null,1,3,2 January 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," No envy here.

But maybe that's OK because it can be witty where the others are just funny. And Apatow is producer.Writer Jason Segel plays Peter, a TV composer whose girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, played by Kristen Bell, dumps him.

The Hunger Games," Smart and Suspenseful
","'And it was decreed that each year, the 12 districts of Panem should offer up a tribute of one young man and woman between the ages of 12 and 18 to be trained in the art of survival and to be prepared to fight to the death.' President Snow (Donald Sutherland)The Hunger Games trilogy, like the Twilight series, is a runaway favorite among teens about a future where the government mandates selected boys and girls fight to the death on reality TV.But forget Twilight as film; The Hunger Games as film is a solid sci-fi thriller with suspense, action, social commentary, and a love interest that's actually interesting. Although overly long by about twenty minutes, from Romeo and Juliet through Deliverance and Hanna, the story embraces the humanity of its characters without forgetting about plain old action. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has volunteered to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games, where a girl and boy are selected from each of twelve districts to compete in survival games from which only one combatant will remain. Taking her cue from her Oscar-nominated role as a teen saving her family in Winter's Bone, Lawrence as Katniss has the grit to shoot squirrels between the eyes and the tenderness to be an advocate for her loved ones at the same time. Katniss's no nonsense common sense is refreshing as it was for Hanna in last year's teen survivor tale. The weight of the games (teens murder each other, after all) is almost overshadowed by the allegorical implications such as contemporary repressive governments and nations lusting for their reality shows.Not for nothing are the contestants brought into the arena on chariots and at one point fight animals ferocious as the lions to which Christians were fed. The presence of two young lovers called 'star-crossed' pays the appropriate homage to the Bard while the forest stalking nods to The Most Dangerous Game. It's all brainy, nail-biting entertainment.'Welcome! We salute your courage and your sacrifice and we wish you Happy Hunger Games!' Snow",8,3,20,22 March 2012
Zootopia," Fun for the whole family.
","'Life's little bit messy. We all make mistakes. No matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you.' Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin)In the land of Zootopia, where all anthropomorphic animals are ostensibly equal, little bunny Judy aspires to be a cop. And she makes it. And she learns her idealism of making a difference is a messy business, like life itself. While this 'toon is clever by any measure, it goes for the heart of living by emphasizing the humanity of endeavors rather than visual techniques (although there's plenty of that).Although our political language is laced with the need for diversity, Zootopia actually shows young people in an allegorical adventure that all species, all races, all kinds of people can prosper together given the right motivation. It is still messy, but it is possible that animals (people), predators and prey, can exist in harmony with a little motivation.The conflict that anchors this exciting actioner is that some previously docile predators have become savage. Officer Hopps, with the help of a sly fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), traces the source of the change to a plant that could only be likened to heroin (not Cannabis, which has been lionized so to speak recently). The thrill of the chase is trumped by the witty dialogue, almost screwball comedy quick (e.g., the answer to 'What do you call a three humped camel?' while not quick and brilliant, is an amusing example of the pervasively comic tone).The slowest sequence may be the funniest: The two 'detectives' end up at the Zootopia DMV, run by all sloths. About his friend, Nick says, 'Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast?' Well, nobody's fast at this bureau, including the jokes, which depend on the sloths' glacial reactions. If you've ever waited at the DMV, you will savor this satire.",Null,4,14,6 March 2016
The Impossible," Excellent acting, less than so story telling.
","2004's tsunami in Thailand was horrific by any standard, and director Juan Antonio Bayona's accounting, The Impossible, does the impossible of making you feel as if you were in the wave's line of sight. The graphics (the ten minute sequence drowns Clint Eastwood's home video viewings of the disaster in Hereafter) and sound are first rate; the story is absorbing but flawed.Maria (Naomi Watts); her husband, Henry (Ewan McGregor); and their three children are vacationing when the wave hits. They are separated. Watts is particularly effective as loving mother in the set up and heroic mother as she swims to save oldest son, Lucas (Tom Holland—a sure Oscar nominee). Afterwards she is hospitalized and loses valuable time to secure the Oscar, if you'll allow me to be crassly commercial.Yet, my callous statement expresses my frustration with the film: So much is given to Fernando Velazquez's original music to heighten the sadness that the film turns out to be manipulative rather more than insightful. That this is one white British family's true story, albeit the true story of a Spanish family, does not compensate for seeing into the heart of the tragedy through the eyes of the Thais (Ed Gonzalez of Slant fully comments on this subject).The film in almost every way gives into the sentimentality of the eventual reconciliation rather than trying to understand the effect on the native people, the music being one component of that deference to emotion rather than discovery. The Impossible's lack of broader focus than one vacationing family's struggle left me feeling I do not fully understand the scope of the tragedy for the Thais or the impact on Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. In that sense, it becomes a high class thriller/terror film from which you must extrapolate broader meaning.Discovering how locals, not wealthy tourists, survive the disaster would have been more rewarding. In the end, The Impossible is a poignant story of one family's struggle to survive and the cohesiveness it achieves through the challenge. From a dramatic point of view, that approach would be good enough if it weren't that the wave's impact goes far beyond one foreign family.",Null,0,1,8 January 2013
42," Take me out to this ballgame.
","Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman): 'You want a player who doesn't have the guts to fight back?'Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford): 'No. I want a player who's got the guts 'not' to fight back.'SAFE! Yes, 42 plays it safe, a biopic about Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) during 1945-47 when he broke the color barrier of major league baseball, the first black player in the majors since 1884. Director/writer Brian Helgeland stays with the outlines of Robinson's remarkable odyssey from minor to a major leaguer whose number 42 was retired for all baseball in his honor. Unfortunately, as with many sports stories about its heroes, even horses, the music swells to obtrusive heights to make sure we feel the right sense of awe at these august proceedings.The formula goes also into Robinson's domestic life, where scenes with his lovely wife, Rachel (Nicole Behane), are boilerplate sweet but adding almost nothing to the drama of the racism surrounding Rickey's decision to hire Robinson for the Brooklyn Dodgers. As the above quote signifies, Rickey is a font of wisdom. He has about all the best lines, such as this one, for another example, to Robinson: 'Your enemy will be out in force. But you cannot meet him on his own low ground.'In addition to having the best lines, Rickey also has too many with a gravitas that threatens to sink the film in solemnity. However, the action scenes in the games bring a reality that hints to me an updated documentary would be even more valuable than this docudrama. In fact, all the period pieces from Ebbets Field to the buses are exquisitely rendered, with clothes just a bit too crisp and cars a bit too clean.But no matter—the game's the thing, and 42 is an old-fashioned sports movie with plenty of sentiment and history to make an enjoyable few hours at the game.",Null,0,0,17 April 2013
Shaun of the Dead," See it in a theater before you turn into a potato watching it on your crumby couch.
","The British penchant for understatement and the audience's perfect understanding of slackers mix to make zombie spoof 'Shaun of the Dead' both funny and appropriate for a society that fosters couch potatoes and underachieving 29 year olds. So universal is the satire that Hollywood movie-making and dear old mums are not spared.Obviously from the title, George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' and numerous other zombie flicks are cannibalized as they rise themselves from the dead heap of old 'B' movies to amuse audiences, and in this case, scare them as well. Director Edgar Wright, who has many British TV series in his resume, knows enough about contemporary 20-something working class blokes to amuse everyone. Shaun (Simon Pegg), an electronics store employee, can't live up to the ambitious expectations of his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Most of his time is spent defending his authentic slacker roommate buddy, Ed (Nick Frost), who trashes the living room with junk food detritus and watches endless TV and games. Ed's comic ability at surprise flatulence or imitating an orangutan amuses and endears Shaun to him.The fun comes when zombies begin roaming London streets and Shaun is so distracted by his own challenges that he doesn't see them. When he does, and he is called upon to act heroically, the Winchester Arms pub, a home for the guys and source of irritation for Liz, becomes home base against the armies of the night.As in 'Harold and Kumar,' the humor is low, but the pace is leisurely enough not to force the satire, as 'Lost Skeleton of Cadavra' did last year. The characters are fully 'fleshed' enough to make us sympathetic to them, a remarkable feat for movies about zombies where characters are usually as undead themselves.(By the way, if you want a real contemporary zombie flick, see'28 Days Later,' by British director Danny Boyle ('Trainspotting'). It is the best horror/zombie film since George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead, and maybe better.)Zombie conventions are fully lampooned in 'Shaun of the Dead'; George Romero would approve.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," It still gets the girls and the audience.
","'They were a rough lot indeed, as sailors mostly are: being men rooted out of all the kindly parts of life, and condemned to toss together . . . them that had sailed with the pirates and seen things it would be a shame even to speak of . . . .' R.L Stevenson Swishbuckling Johnny Depp as pirate captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest reprises a role that in its maiden voyage looked like a great vehicle for Depp to show his many mugging and voice talents. Now he is a caricature of himself endlessly repeating the ticks that once tocked.The pirates are looking for too many treasures, gold and human, so the film ends up being a stew of concepts looking for a rest. Thank goodness for easy-to-look-at Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, a damsel hopelessly caught between her need to save virtuous fiancé Will Turner and her passion for the reprobate Sparrow. The special effects are the same old quick cuts and malleable cosmetics, crafting a crafty Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with moving worms on his face and a kraken with tentacles worthy of Jules Verne but far more believable. Depp is the Errol Flynn of our time but with much deeper talent and narrower taste in women (Vanessa Paradis as a wife is enough for any man in a lifetime).I have little else to say. The original Pirates of the Caribbean was an original and Depp a most creative Sparrow. The second time around it's more of the same, not a stretch or a necessity for an actor of Depp's considerable talent. As for Orlando Bloom, a sizable paycheck for no challenge is a bit like a pirate finding a chest of goldhe doesn't deserve it, but it still gets the girls and the audience.",Null,17,73,3 July 2006
Argo," Ben Affleck moves closer to auteur status.
","'We had suicide missions in the Army that had better odds than this.' Lester (Alan Arkin) Although the historical events depicted in Argo for extricating six embassy employees from Iran during the infamous 444 day hostage debacle may not have happened just as director Ben Affleck and writer Chris Terrio depict them, the movie is an edge-of-the-seat thriller done better than any other film of its kind this year. The above quotation by Lester, a Hollywood producer recruited for the gamble, captures the danger and promise of the escapade.The reason for my A- rather than A is the ending escape sequence, which is pure Hollywood, preposterous and entertaining. If you're not rooting for the personnel to get away, then you must be an old timer who worked for fundamentalist Islam's Ayatollah Khomeini.The strategy devised by Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) was called the 'Hollywood Option,' and more to the point, the 'best bad idea,' a bold masquerade in which Mendez and the six were disguised as Canadian filmmakers seeking a location for a low-budget sci-fi film. The tension, expertly maintained by director Affleck, rests almost solely on whether or not their fiction is uncovered. Affleck underplays Mendez in a posture necessary for remaining cool in the face of Iranian authorities seeking Americans to hang.Besides evoking the late seventies' dorky fashions of ubiquitous mustaches, long hair, and large glasses, Argo recreates the volatile environment of world affairs when relief from Vietnam did not mean relief from rogue governments like Iran's, as the condemnation of Salman Rushdie has taught well. Every Iranian bureaucrat and soldier carries a hidden threat in beards and bearing. At the airport, the multiple check points ramp up the anxiety, enhanced no doubt by our experiences with post 9/11 TSA.If you're disappointed by that Hollywood ending, wait for the post-credits sequence, which juxtaposes photos of Tehran at the time with the film's stills. If that bit of realism doesn't satisfy you, then enjoy the superior acting of John Goodman as make-up artist John Chambers and Arkin. Now that's the real Hollywood.",Null,80,145,12 October 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," `Pirates of the Caribbean' is worth seeing for its unpretentious fun for the family, just like Disneyland.
","`Shiver me timbers!' Matey, we have the coolest pirate film of the summer with Gore Verbinski's (`The Ring') `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Jade.' The coolest pirate of all time may be Johnny Depp's (`Chocolat') captain Jack Sparrow, a fey swashbuckler with androgynous mannerisms and a slightly besotted mien possibly from too much wine or just an overactive actor's imagination.  At any rate, Depp steals the booty and the film in a gracious act of saving the summer from the absence of any unforgettable performance. Verbinski clearly let Depp do what he wanted, and he did. Fortunately, unlike Marlon Brando on the loose, Depp can contain his genius and entertain while still showing formidable talent of the very best in film today.Inspired by the Disney theme park ride of the same name, `Pirates' tells of Sparrow pursuing the ghost ship Black Jade, run by a real skeleton crew and headed by the sordid Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). They seek to break an ancient curse by kidnapping the luscious Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, `Bend It like Beckham'). Most of this is parody of all the pirate films ever made, right down to the talking parrot on the buccaneer's shoulder, swordfights, treasure coves, and a post-modern pirate's code interpreted as just `guidelines.'  Even Orlando Bloom as Knightley's love interest looks like a young Errol Flynn.  With over 600 visual effects shots as well, Verbinski succeeds in making a rollicking good story while satirizing the genre at the same time. But at 143 minutes, with several returns to the same locations and a tedious father-daughter tiff, `Pirates' is too long and repetitious.  Without the watchable Depp, it could have been the sunken `Cutthroat Island' of mid-nineties infamy. The bard as always catches the cavalier spirit: 'Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage, And purchase friends, and give to courtezans, Still revelling like lords till all be gone . . . .'As it is, in a summer of mediocrity, `Pirates of the Caribbean' is worth seeing for its unpretentious fun for the family, just like Disneyland.",Null,3,7,8 July 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," A seminar on leadership
","'You think you're safe. You are not. Is there anything you would not do for your family?' John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) If a good story has believable, changing characters and good sci-fi has believable travel and action, Star Trek Into Darkness is good and then some. Before James Kirk (Chris Pine) becomes the seasoned leader we've come to know and love, he is cowboying around early on, saving Spock (Zachary Quinto), losing his command, and generally testing his father-figure, Pike (Bruce Greenwood), who has been the catalyst for the cocky young officer's career.If photons and beams were all there is to this opera, then I would have little to report except that director J.J. Abrams has the CGI technology down just right to make the travel and the warfare believable. But character and morality trump the action to such a fine extent that this episode could serve as talking points for a graduate seminar on leadership.The opening episode has to do with Kirk choosing to save Spock's life to follow the Prime Directive not to interfere in other civilizations. Kirk's choice is emblematic of the film's humanistic core, where saving the friend forces Kirk to violate orders, as he frequently does, in favor of love. If James Carvel had to say it, he would proclaim, 'It's the people, Stupid.' The introductory quote serves as a reminder that Star Trek is always about people and family, the latter encompassing as well the crew as 'family.' So many villains have visited our audiences that to have one stand out, say like Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, is rare. However, one of the best bad guys ever is Khan, played with menace and charm by TV's Sherlock Holmes, Benedict Cumberbatch. His physical presence, bass voice, and imposing eyes alone demand respect. He's not a good guy, but you want him to be around just the way we wanted the original Khan, Ricardo Montalban, decades ago.Study the delicacies of command and the complexity of the personal with Star Trek Into the Darkness. If for nothing else, the constant struggle between the logical and the emotional (Spock and Kirk) is as satisfying at times as those clashes on Shakespeare's Tempest: 'Mr. Spock. The mind of the Enterprise. The fearless genius who ensures a calm force of intelligence guides their every mission. But look deeper and you will see an outsider who does not belong, a man of two worlds. This tears him apart, the constant battle between what he thinks and what he feels. What does he do? Does he follow his head, embracing logic and the path of reason? Or does he follow his heart, knowing the emotions he cannot control may destroy him? I will help him decide...'John Harrison (Khan).Star Trek Into Darkness is a satisfying summer delight that has razzle-dazzle effects with enough humanity to start a brave new world.",Null,2,5,20 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Rewarding
","Finally a rom-com for everyone. Additionally, midsummer comedy Crazy, Stupid Love is at times as much a drama as it is laugh generating. In fact, is as serious a deconstruction of modern love as it is a humorous exposition of how stupid and crazy it can be for teens through adults.And rewarding and mystifying and . . . Well, you get the idea: this film sweetly shows the fortitude needed to play the game, right to the end.Cal (Steve Carell) is being divorced by Emily (Julianne Moore) after 25 years of soul mating. Jacob (Ryan Gosling) helps him get over his despair by teaching him to be cool with women. But Cal's heart belongs to Emily to the end. That part of the action is easy to predict; it's the other characters that lend color and unity to the pursuit of love by every healthy girl and boy, man and women.Son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) loves babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who loves Cal, whose wife has had an affair with David (Kevin Bacon), who loves Emily. Throw in a horny teacher Kate (Marisa Tomei), whom Cal loves ever so briefly, and you have a zoo of unfulfilled love that only an American farce can untangle at only the right time.

Green Room," Enjoyable thriller, horror, and comedy in one cool package.
","Punk rock bands like the one in Green Room frequently spout hoary lyrics, but this band witnesses a murder that pits them against skinheads who fulfill the expectations of the most violent lyrics. Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier helms this one so deftly that I would like to call it a smart comic thriller if it weren't for the horrible images cropping up at the right times.Similar to the other intelligent horror flick recently, 10 Cloverfield Lane, it's about young adults, this time in a punk rock group, headed by Pat (Anton Yelchin), fighting experienced villains (John Goodman in 10, Patrick Stewart as Darcy in Green) and while the formula dictates that the youngsters, in reduced numbers, overcome the oldsters, this version takes many turns before it gives in to the dictates of the genre. The vibe is '80's horror- thriller with Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs an appropriate comparison.The languid set up, where we see the band hopping from one low-paying gig to another with a charming sense of humor, sets a right tone of fecklessness that leads to the danger of an exclusive metal club in Oregon catering to straight white-male supremacists manufacturing maybe heroin in their basement. Enter the head honcho, Darcy, as cool as a starship captain, and as indifferent to violence as only a man who has others do his dirty work can. Although things get more violent in dealing with the resourceful youngsters, he remains cool: 'Forensics is no longer a concern,' he says after planning a flawless scene for the cops that has turned bad for his team.The intelligence of the panicked punkers and the menace of the skinheads help to keep us attentive at all times to see what happens next. Although some expectations are met, there are enough plot twists to keep us thrilled and to make sense, unlike so many slasher, violence-induced films. Here, the band really has to play in tune, so to speak, facing mounting horrors such as a mangled arm and gruesome jugular feast by the teeth of an attack dog.Just as in an allegorical way, most peaceful nations are dragged into violence because there are no alternatives, the band resorts to gruesome violence as the only answer to the carnage meted out by their captives. I like the realistic, albeit violent, way the plot progresses. Well, it has to be so or we get no horror, and I get no vicarious thrill out of being unharmed. Except maybe psychologically.'Later is better for time of death,' says Darcy. Now that's terrifyingly cool.",Null,1,7,26 April 2016
Public Enemies," Robbed!
","'They ain't tough enough, smart enough or fast enough. I can hit any bank I want, any time. They got to be at every bank, all the time.' John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) Yes, they were 'smart enough.' Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Crudup) chosen agent to find Dillinger, uses his smarts to get associates to rat on him, and some 'tough' heavy artillery to bring down the pop culture hero.Johnny Depp in Public Enemies is about as distant from an Oscar playing gangster Dillinger as he could get playing a pirate: he underplays one of the most infamous bank robbers of the Depression as if director Michael Mann told him to hide while the feds were tracking him for spilling milk.Although other attempts to portray this rogue in film and TV have fallen short as well, you'd think the director of Manhunter, Heat, and The Insider could come up with a more exciting rendition because Tommy guns just don't an interesting movie make anymore.Saving the film from complete boredom is the relationship between Dillinger and his love, Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), because both actors are capable of subtlety: The characters dance around each other, especially Billie, who is reluctant to hitch up with a 'most wanted' guy. Although Depp never shows much emotion, Cotillard makes a fine reluctant lover, developing her love to the point of a devotion that happily endangers her with the feds. As for Mann, he has always peopled his films with difficult, frustrating loves, in a sense saving himself from being compared to Michael Bay.'He could be the man sat next to you!' So says the announcer about Dillinger on the 1930's movie screen as he uncomfortably tries not to be noticed. He should have paid attention to his nerves: a movie house will be his undoing. Meanwhile, our theaters will be undone with weak ticket sales; he's still robbing the establishment.To give Depp his due, he has the best line of the movie, and we can't hear it.

The Babadook," Anyone who's suffered loss knows this horror.
","'You can't get rid of the Babadook.' Samuel (Noah Wiseman) The monsters they do live inside us, except, of course, when they also inhabit our humble homes, which is the stuff of horror films for over a hundred years. In that well-prescribed genre rests Jennifer Kent's disturbing The Babadook, one of the best psycho-horror films in recent years.Almost jumping off a children's terrorizing pop-up book, Mister Babadook, the titular monster and typical kids' bogeyman, is first of all an obvious metaphor for the demon that dogs a mom, Amelia ( the fine Essie Davis), after losing her husband in a car accident as she is going to give birth to her 6 year-old son, Samuel. As they try to deal with the loss and its resentments, mom and son can't shake the terror of losing dad and husband, nor can the guilt-ridden Samuel let go of the feeling that Babadook is in their lives for the long haul: 'You can bring me the boy,' says Babadook, in a statement redolent of revenge and resentment.Actually seeing the monster as it invades their house is rare, as it should be, given the suspenseful emphasis on the son's growing obsession with the ghoul's presence and Mom's increasing mania. In other words, this film works as a psychological study almost better than a horror story.In some ways it reminds me of The Innocents, and in other ways it is notably a successful rendition of the modern female fighting elements that used to be reserved for the flawed male (think of The Shining as a shining example of the male-dominated horror flick).First-time Australian director Kent's relaxed depiction of the possession until the effective climax and denouement goes a long way to let the audience consider the psychological ramifications of profound loss. Rarely does she gives us the standard clichÃ©s like false alarms and banging doors; rather she lets the horror emanate from the seemingly possessed Samuel and mom's emerging dementia.'Don't let it in.'

The Other Boleyn Girl," Squandered . . .
","Losing your head to ambition is pretty much what we know of Anne Boleyn, wife of the mercurial Henry VIII, who clipped a few necks to get a legitimate Tudor heir. The Other Boleyn Girl details the inner workings of the Boleyn family's intrigues to get their daughters in the bed of the king to secure their fortunes. The relentlessly disappointing births form the boring center of a period drama that shows how the superior talents of Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary) can be squandered.The accessories, like those in Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, are visually stunning: costumes, castles, boudoirs are appointed sumptuously and, I presume, accurately. What's lacking here is in the depiction of Henry by Eric Bana, as physically, intellectually, and emotionally far from Charles Laughton's defining portrayal as could be possible. Even if Laughton's part were trumped up, the king who married six times and may have composed Greensleeves (Anne did reject his advances, after all ( 'cast me off discourteously') was more than a disappointed baby maker, as neophyte director Justin Chadwick has Bana play it.That Anne was beheaded for adultery is known; when the film proposes incest as a mitigating circumstance, I'm lost to the extent that I'll have to verify this salacious footnote at a future date. The film does acknowledge that Henry assumed a dangerous power after he realized that an alliance with Rome was unnecessary. But then this is essentially a study of sixteenth-century women lost to the power of men, not a history of bad boy Henry.As a feminist tract, The Other Boleyn Girl works. These ladies define their lives by achieving social station in whatever way possible, being reminded of their infamy by their mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, played with an ominous resignation by Kristin Scott-Thomas. The ascendancy of the surpassing Elizabeth to the throne, presiding over the arguably most productive era in Western history, is a satisfactory coda to this film and a supreme irony for a king who thought only a male heir could assure transcendent hegemony.Hillary Clinton's achievements can be illuminated and enhanced by looking at the centuries-old queen who supported William Shakespeare. Perhaps Hillary will join Elizabeth in making converts of obtuse men and enabling women in the 21st century.",Null,14,58,25 February 2008

Adelaide (Madison Curry)You thought Jordan Peele's Get Out was a smart person's horror film; well his Us is even better because the intelligent themes are there, but the horror elements are amped up, quite reasonably I'd have to say. A sweet family is terrorized by its doppelgangers, who seem to represent the dark side of themselves and humanity.The thrills are more than the usual horror tropes like jump scares and scary rooms. Each character must face his twin and fight it as if his life depended on it, and it does. When the opening scene has young Adelaide strolling away from her parents at the Santa Cruz beach into a fun-house hall of mirrors, you know she will face her twin, Young Red, and be forever changed for that brief 15 minutes.Writer Peele lets the growing family prosper slowly until the twin family arrives, when baseball bats and fireplace pokers can do only so much to dispel those creatures. One of the nice touches is that the good guys can be effective against the home invaders but only with cunning and a ton of courage. As with most of this genre, no creature dies easily or quickly.If like me, you take your horror lite, in Us is plenty of small asides that give a chuckle and also add to the suspense. When dad (Winston Duke, physically resembling Tyler Perry and Jordan Peele and therefore likeable if not at times schlubby), comments that mom has just left the car, the dark humor is that she's left to find one of the twins and armed only with the now iconic scissors. We want to tell her not to go there alone because we know the tradition of a loner going into a forest.As for star of Us, mom Adelaide/Red (Lupita Nyong'o) kicks butt most of the time because dad is debilitated, and women in general are more apt to take over these days. See this excellent film at a time of year when we could have expected less.",Null,7,21,22 March 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not to be confused with Pirates of the Caribbean or Thief of Baghdad
","Tamina: 'Only the Dagger can unlock the Sands of Time. And there are those who would use this power to destroy the world.'Playing with time can be dangerous, tricky, and silly. True in the case of this year's Hot Tub Time Machine and less so but still mindless is producer Jerry Bruckheimer's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Medieval Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) team up to return sand to the handle of a magic knife that will save the world.You don't need to know more because little else makes sense except the ability of editing to cut so quickly to action that anything can happen as long as someone says it was so; you can't tell from what you see, generally a blur. But then you've seen it all already: Jake mimicking Harrison Ford, Douglas Fairbanks, William Powell, and Errol Flynn with flying leaps and blinding sword play.The princess is, of course, patterned after Princess Leia, and bad Uncle Nazim by Sir Ben Kingsley, whose role as adviser recommending conquering an innocent kingdom under the ruse that it sells weapons to the Persian's enemies channels very nicely Dick Cheney and his Iraq War supporters.More than interest in the veiled allusion to the 21st century is the ironic humor, lame as it is, especially between Dastan and Tamina. Somehow Indiana Jones had better lines in his worst films, and these two can't come close to Han Solo and Princess Leia. (For example: Prince Dastan: You really enjoy telling me what to do, don't you? Tamina: Only because you are so good at following orders. Prince Dastan: Don't press your luck.)My advice for the beginning of summer: Don't take a safari; just order a cool gin and tonic, and if it comes with Prince of Persia or Sex and the City 2, enjoy the sand without heat or wit.",Null,1,5,28 May 2010
Balls of Fury," Not Powerball
","For a slacker comedy, one of the indexes I think I will use is how many times the hero is kicked in the groin. In Balls of Fury, ex-ping-pong Olympian Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) is kicked in the titular region at least three times, making this a pratfall-prone, intellectually-challenged comedy with enough low-level laughs to satisfy base cultural instincts. He is hired by the FBI to smoke out a world-class villain Feng (Christopher Walken) with an affinity for table tennis.The echoes of Karate Kid and Enter the Dragon are fleeting, looking like great dramas next to this uneven revenge/kung fu comedy.The laughs, especially those that have Randy bouncing his ball off an opponent's face (you have to see it in its context to enjoy), are enough for even my guest laugher, Patricia, to continue her mirth marathon with her son. But the jokes are usually base, elevated by the presence of Christopher Walken, who has perfected self parody to an extent that laughs abound before he says his first line. His fey Fang is amusing given his usually virile roles, but he makes credible the claim that he 'dresses out of Elton John's garage sale.' Maggie Q as Maggie is slender and charming, lending a martial arts aura to the proceedings, satirizing the genre with charm.Def Leppard does its best to keep the action at least musically interesting, its 'Pour Some Sugar on Me' rendition by the cast a high point, albeit in the closing credits. The revenge-themed dramas of this summer will not suffer by comparison. The superior summer slacker spectacles, Knocked Up and Superbad, are not in danger of competition from this lightweight fin de summer competitor.Balls of Fury is just a slight amusement lacking the power suggested by its title.",Null,9,18,28 August 2007
Ted," Stuffed, foul, and funny
","Although it's a stretch to call anything by the Family Guy creator 'cute,' director-writer Seth MacFarlane has endearing moments in his comedy Ted. However, the preponderance of jokes here are raw, rude, scatological, and outrageous, as is MacFarlane's trademark.He is the voice of teddy bear Ted, brought to life when little John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) wishes life into him. Now at 35, John and Ted are best friends sharing life with John's girl, Lori (Mila Kunis). The laughs are plenty, even clean ones like this:Ted: (dressed in a suit and tie) I look stupid. John: No, you don't, you look dapper. Ted: John, I look like something you give to your kid when you tell 'em Grandma died.Then the romantic tension sets in and the humor vanishes while John and Lori work out the expected problem of the teddy bear buddy occupying John's time and imagination instead of Lori. While some of this convention simply has to be followed in rom-com's, the predictability compromises some of John and Ted's fast-paced, working-class Boston dialogue that otherwise carries the show. Suffice it to say, all will turn out right, even if the stuffing gets knocked out of Ted because love wins the day for the humans and, come to think of it, for the bears as well.",Null,1,11,28 June 2012
Knives Out," A light whodunit for Thanksgiving.
","'This is a twisted web, and we are not finished untangling it, not yet.' Benoit Blanc (Daniel CraigIt's tough to mix crime and humor, but writer/director Rian Johnson does it well with Knives Out. A spoof of Agatha-Christie-like murder mysteries involving family, Knives is sharp with off-handed humor, especially through the sleuth detective, Benoit Blanc, who has a dry delivery almost as irritating as his ersatz Southern accent.The investigation afoot is the suicide of the patriarch, Harlan Twombly (Christopher Plummer), which Blanc suspects is a murder. The many relatives, all to benefit from a favorable will, are suspects. The house, of course, is gothic Victorian seen more than once from above in the now-common drone shots.The humor comes in turning upside down our usual expectations for a whodunit. A suspect immediately arises, and the resolution comes with innocence in the forefront. Neither of those circumstances conform to the usual tropes, but added humor comes from the expert acting of those who deliver irony deftly and subtly and the contemporary references such as Baby Driver and Juuling to make it modern.When Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette) exclaims about Benoit, 'I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you,' current culture is updating the old mystery formula. And it's all in good humor.
At times the dialogue flies between characters as if Robert Altman were running the show. Overlapping swift repartee can leave some of us behind, especially as we like to savor each word. Yet, the speed gives an energy to an otherwise not remarkably ingenious plot.The contradictions to the mystery formula are often surprising and fun. After a full day of Thanksgiving, including the often-thrilling mysterious dinner, Knives is a welcome joy and reflection, happily neglecting to murder smart-aleck patriarchs like me.",Null,3,13,25 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," It's the best American movie so far this year and the best comic book adaptation ever.
","'I'll peel the skin off your face!' Spidey nemesis Doc Ock informs one of his victims how he feels. Here's how I feel about director Sam Raimi's ('Spider-Man,' 'A Simple Plan') 'Spider-Man 2': It's the best American movie so far this year and the best comic book adaptation ever filmed.Not hard to figure because the writers are a Pulitzer winner Michael Chabon ('The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay') and Oscar winner Alvin Sargent ('Ordinary People'). This is the kind of movie American filmmakers excel at with outrageous action, weepy relationships, and glorious endings, all spiced with unparalleled special effects and actors such as Tobey Maguire destined to play their roles. Peter Parker (Maguire) is still rejecting Mary Jane because of the danger his Spider-Man persona would bring her if people knew who he was. The interesting twist in this second installment is that Spidey loses his powers in conjunction with several other losses in his life, love and job included.That maxim, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' still eludes him because he disavows heroic responsibility and hurls himself into an existential funk questioning his purpose in life. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) makes it difficult for Parker to quit the web-based business because Ock's experiments with fusion threaten all of New York City (a popular target this year: Do you remember it frozen in 'Day After Tomorrow'?), and Spidey is the only one who can defeat him. Molina's octopus-like tentacles almost achieve character-status themselves; his climbing Manhattan buildings with various female victims in his grasps evokes the great King Kong. Like Kong, Ock has a soft side that makes him less a monster and more a human. Among several themes is the importance of responsibility, a lesson for all the major characters, including slimy newspaper editor J. Jonah Jamison (J.K Simmons), who almost steals the picture with his over-the-top selfishness and brief moment of remorse. Stan Lee, who created the complex hero for Marvel comics in 1962, has a cameo, but his understanding of human frailty pervades the film. He achieved that heroic ambivalence only hinted at in the Superman series.Tobey Maguire ('Cider House Rules,' 'Seabiscuit') has the youthful idealism and stunned-by-reality look to make the complicated change of life he will try later on credible. He reminds me of another struggling, lonely and poor hero, Thomas Hardy's Tess, who likened herself to a lonely spider, 'which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever came, and shivered in the slight draft through the casement.'Maguire's gift as an actor is to relay the American dream and the American drama of self-discovery in his eyes. No other actor can better demand our respect for his journey from innocence to experience. He is America.So George Bush and the neocons should love the responsibility theme of this film considering the sacrifices the War in Iraq has asked of Americans. The other themes of sacrificing for love and discovering one's self may be too subtle for anyone but Kerry supporters. Either way, this is a movie to draw you firmly and forever into its warm web, even more than the original did.Stay put because Spidey 3 is spinning another web.",Null,0,0,28 June 2004
The Secret in Their Eyes," The eyes have it.
","'Justice is an island. We work out in the real world.' Dateline: Buenos Aires 1974 -2000. Oscar-winning The Secret in Their Eyes trips between an Argentinean murder in 1974 and the involved justice Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) retired now and writing about the gruesome rape- homicide. Unlike in other thrillers, even Silence of the Lambs, director/ writer Juan Jose Campanella weaves a credible love story between protagonist Benjamin (and his boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil), with the love of a husband for his young murdered wife highlighting the somber effect of time, or its lack thereof, on those whose eyes may or may not hold the secret.This intriguing and typically-slow exposition by a not-American director is a thriller of the first orderâ€”accumulation of facts and revelation of emotions while methodically nailing down the murderer, perhaps a bit like Lady with the Dragon Tattoo with a dash of Silence of the Lambs. As is to be expected of non-CGI dominated international films, character is everything, from a sidekick with a drinking problem and sacrificing heart to a murderer complex as the best cinematic murderers like Jackie Earle Haley's. The figurative importance of the eyes, burnished by multiple close-ups, is a motif that emphasizes the literate approach of the entire artwork.In Eyes, the jumping across time is handled with a rare fluidity, helped by a graying beard on the protagonist but not helped by Ms. Villamil, who may never be able to play old because of her Sophia-Loren indestructible looks. The time mix influences the attachment we feel for characters fighting time but trying to live for the present. Especially when it comes to expressing affection, so easy to fob off on time or think like Eliot's Prufrock that 'indeed there will be time,' when there will be little to none.The Secret in Their Eyes is a somewhat languid eye-opener, the cinematic equivalent of seeing Casablanca after Letters to Juliet, a variation of the sublime to the ridiculous. No matter, now and then Oscar gets it rightâ€”best foreign language film of the year. The eyes have it.",Null,3,6,3 June 2010
Black Book," Mark this film down in your black or red book as a must-see for 2007.
","Like The Lives of Others, the absorbing European war thriller Black Book again certifies that massive FX need not be the major ingredient of a popular filmHollywood take notice.'So good is his re-creation that he forgot to infuse his leads with enough character to make me care. In fact, so intent is the director on re-creation that he forgot creation is the essence of successful art.' That's what I said about Steven Soderberg's Good German starring George Clooney and Cate Blanchette. I say just the opposite about Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, a similar WWII story about nasty Nazis but set at the beginning of the end of the war, 1944 rather than 1945. Verhoeven's set-design recreation is faultless, but unlike Soderberg's, this one's in the service of well-developed characterization and a humdinger of a plot.Although Blanchette could be remembered as a wily woman surviving to get out of Berlin in Good German, the Dutch Carice van Houten simply cannot be forgotten as a Dutch Jewish singer, Rachel/Elis, trying to escape German-occupied Holland, a serious resistance fighter willing to sacrifice her body to stop the Holocaust. Along with her is the memorable Sebastian Koch from Lives of Others as Ludwig Muntze, a leading Nazi with a conscience. The ensemble reminds me of Casablanca's stellar quality in every character, major or minor.The weaknesses of the film cannot overshadow its strengths: Plot twists are overripe, although I suspect people on both sides of the betrayal game trying to save themselves were not uncommon in 1944. Ellis's uncanny ability to survive in all the lurid carnage is surpassed only by Mata Hari, WWI's exotic dancer spy.Black Book satisfies an audience's interest in a tumultuous past, its thirst for engaging intrigue, and its search for acting of the first order.

127 Hours," 'Oops.'
","'Oops.' Aron Ralston into his video camera as he sees his right arm pinned by a boulder.I'm back in the saddle again, my motorcycle and Utah that is, whose Canyons and monoliths mesmerized me every time a sped through them. But never did I linger in the crevices, where Nature and a certain rock had been waiting for hiker Aron Ralston to fall through and over 5 days later cut his wedged arm off to gain the independence he had been seeking his whole life, but not at such a cost.Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle has caught the expansive and claustrophobic at the same time with eagles soaring and young man Aron (James Franco) exalting, be it 'bounding like a Roe' on his mountain bike, as Wordsworth would say, or swimming with girls he meets along the path, ironically guiding them to freedom while he unknowingly awaits his own imprisonment.The 'prison' days are enlivened by thoughts of his thoughtlessness that led to no one knowing where he is—he ignores his mother's call, doesn't tell a co-worker where he is going, and fails on every level of communication with his ex-love (Clemence Poesy). Consequently the figure who emerges is a lyrical, thoughtless romantic who may be more engaging than Tom Hanks' loner of Cast Away but not as responsible.Although the survival of a superb athlete is the central story, the theme is just as simple: Being alone is detrimental to your health. Boyle verifies the theme with lively montages at the beginning and end of the film.A thoughtlessly left-behind Swiss Army Knife and messages unanswered serve as appropriate tropes for the careless life of this determined loner. 127 hours brings back the wilderness of my youthful adventures that never took for granted the frailty of the 1100 CC's between my legs and the carelessness of a Nature that had better things to do than worry about me the way my mother would.",Null,1,4,17 November 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Man-dated Mischief
","It's a 'man-date'! Yes, it's a phenomenon I know little about: Men who need friends go on 'man-dates.' I Love You, Man is a Judd Apatow-type comedy about an engaged real estate salesman Peter Klaven (Paul Ruddan Apatow grad), who, as a typical 'girlfriend guy,' needs to make male friends, especially because he knows no one to be his best man. The estimable director Patrice Leconte got to a similar subject in My Best Friend but with fewer laughs but a smoother take all around as befitting the French.Writer/director John Hamburg's little comedy of manners has the usual scatological, penis jokes, but mostly in the beginning to establish its cred as a funny albeit raunchy guy (and chick) flick. Sometimes the director shows his lack of comedic deftness, for instance, when new buddy 'investor' Sydney (Jason Segel) lets his dog poop three times, the first not very funny, much less two more times without pickling it upbut, hey, just seeing it happen is tasteless and boring enough.I Love You, Man even has its Seth Rogen slacker in Segel, who is more laid-back than Rogen but less funny. The combination of Rudd and Segel is comically successful, an apples-and-oranges act that plays authentic, partly because their characters are honest guys with typical issues that they unusually talk about. For example, Rudd's fiancé, Zooey (Rashida Jones) apparently doesn't like oral sex; Segel moves that piece of privacy with a very public toast and through much of the movie, mostly as a motif to parse Rudd's relationship with his fiancé.Because deconstructing male friendships is mostly unchartered territory for movies (women have owned the chick- bonding theme forever), Hamburg does an admirable job playing with the many variations of male bonding. Most telling is the juxtaposition of girlfriends sharing all and males sharing little and the attendant indignation on the part of the ladies when the men start serious bonding.Hamburg does well enough with other characters, such as bickering couple Barry (Jon Favreau) and Jaime Pressly) and JK Simmons' earthy dad. Overall, I Love You, Man is a welcome addition to the current spate of light adult fare that opens up the possibility of further male-psyche exploration. It's wild territory and potentially more satirical than this movie.",Null,1,6,16 March 2009
Creed," The second-best next to Rocky, and one of the great boxing stories.
","You know the drill: Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) will either win or lose the last bout of Johnson VS. Pretty Boy Conlan, who has a few choice barbs sent Donny's way before the bout, just so we don't like him. It's an unavoidable formula done well by some solid performances from Sly Stallone and Michael B. Jordan.Although it sounds like I'm relegating this film to formula hell, it actually rises above the clichéd boxing story to tackle real issues such as family and disease with a legacy handicap each child must overcome (think Michael Douglas, for instance). The large issue here is Donny coming to terms with the shadow of his famous father Apollo, at one time the greatest boxer in the world.Never for a second doubt that Rocky (Stallone) will return as he always does in this series, this time as an old man who agrees to train young Creed (Jordan). Stallone is credible as a former heavy weight champion with life lessons aplenty. For that matter, Jordan has both the physique and attitude of a bloodline that brooks no defeat. Bianca (Tessa Thompson) as Adonis's love interest underplays nicely a role usually reserved for a demure, dismissed female.Creed is a solid entry in the boxing genre, not anywhere near the complexity of Raging Bull but good enough for a rainy Saturday afternoon at the movies. Come to think of it, that's a cliché that still works, too.",Null,2,6,29 November 2015
Hot Fuzz," Bright Satire
","Most of the artists attached to Shaun of the Dead, that dead on spoof of zombie films, are responsible for the action, buddy-cop satire, Hot Fuzz. The wit in both is similar, straddling between irreverent takes of the genre while still providing a fast-paced, somewhat suspenseful story. Hot Fuzz isn't the classic Shaun has turned out to be, but it is an enjoyably humorous skewering of the US's Die Hard and Lethal Weapon franchises and UK police dramas, sharp enough to make Richard Donner, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Michael Bay uncomfortable.London Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is reassigned to quiet hamlet Sanford because he's just too good a cop (400 percent better than anyone else). They need him to go so they don't look so bad by comparison. Angel is type A, left-brained obsessive compulsive on whom no clue or righteous arrest is lost. Pursuing a rogue swan is clearly beneath him in this quiet town, but soon he intrepidly investigates suspicious deaths related to the town's interest in the best- town-in-England prize.His buddy cop, PC Danny Butterman ( Nick Frost) provides the dufus- with-a-heart laughs, allowing for plenty of yin/yang contrasts between the uptight sergeant and the loose patrolman. Underneath the sometimes absurd but amusing interchanges lies a dialogue about the need to make judgments about who should be jailed and who is no danger to society (such as teenage drinkers better off in jail than on the streets and street performers posing minimal threat to society).Witticisms abound such as the names fitting the characters (cop as Angel, reporter as Messenger) and numerous borrowings from setups and dialogue in other films (Point Break, Dirty Harry, and Straw Dogs, etc.). The homoerotic subtext in many of these references is gently hinted at.But all in all, it is a bright satire that somehow ends up being a minor sermon on the dangers of perfection and the joys of experiencing life in wholly different ways.",Null,1,2,16 April 2007
Constantine," A horror film with somewhere to go.
","Jonah Goldberg, editor at large of National Review OnLine, recently wrote that 'we couldn't appreciate that evil is real and it exists. In a society where everyone is a victim and it's not right to 'judge' others, there's not much room left for real monsters, while society itself becomes monstrous.' And so Hannibal Lecter is a 'charming rogue' rather than a monster.A new paranormal action thriller, Constantine, brings us back to the days of discernible demons. An old Catholic boy like me truly enjoys any struggle between good and evil that features luminaries such as Lucifer, Balthazar, and Gabriel. Have minimalist actor Keanu Reeves play a supernatural detective with echoes of Matrix's Neo and the talented Tilda Swinton (The Deep End) a genderless Angel Gabriel and you have a horror film with somewhere to go, to Hades that is. These are monsters and angels I can see and love and hate and most of all, call them what they are.Reeves' lung-cancer-terminal John Constantine is from the Hellblazer comic book, a bad boy sleuth who has literally been to Hell and now chases half-breed Hell denizens back to where they belong so that he might win his way to heaven. His partner, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), tags along to find out why her twin sister committed suicide in circumstances that have hellish affiliations. Beyond this summary lies a convoluted story about Constantine's attempts to keep a balance between heaven and hell that stops long enough for us to enjoy an over-the-top visit from white-clad Satan, played with obvious delight by Peter Stormare (Minority Report).The f/x is as impressive as any horror/thriller's out there today, and Reeves' performance is as one note as we have come to expect. His clothes, thanks to Louise Frogley's monochromatic costuming, are slick black, a complement to the noirish world of black and white. (For you purists, the comic book hero is made into a Los Angeles native allegedly because Reeves couldn't be counted on to keep a proper Brit accent for over two hours).The theme of good versus evil having been overplayed in our cinema, we are left with little but a titillating twist to keep us interested. So the interest for this Catholic boy is the idea that evil must exist in order for good to triumph. Constantine, therefore, tries to figure out how evil survives and why it must. Maybe he decides that without evil there is just a bunch of blue staters waiting for the second coming of a Clinton in 2008.",Null,4,21,13 February 2005
Troy," An enjoyable and memorable blockbuster to complement a summer of real war and conflicted citizenry.
","Having popular actor hero Brad Pitt (`The Mexican') play classical warrior Achilles could be like having Jim Carey play JFK-It just doesn't seem like a good fit. After all, Pitt's pretty-boy baggage and the otherworldly genes of the greatest fighter in literature don't seem to go together.  But they do! Pitt does well enough with Homer's `Iliad' to make sure Wolfgang Petersen's (`Das Boot,' `Perfect Storm') will henceforth be shown by all classics departments as the definitive tale of The Trojan War told in `The Iliad' and the `Odyssey.' When Pitt as Achilles says he did not engage Hector in the first meeting because `it's too early to kill princes,' I was won over by the arrogance and superiority of the hero and the actor.The adaptation looks good enough to satisfy classics undergrads, who may have read the original in Greek.  Besides the proud and lonely Achilles are the vain and cowardly Paris (Orlando Bloom), the foolish and unfaithful Helen (Diane Kruger), the greedy and gaudy Agamemnon (Brian Cox), and the heroic and harried Hector (Eric Bana). The film lays out each one's strength's and weaknesses, integrates the action into the catalytic abduction of Helen and husband Menelaus's (Brendan Gleeson) campaign to gain back his honor.  During all this Achilles has to be persuaded to fight because of his feud with Agamemnon, but not a difficult persuasion after Hector unknowingly kills Achilles' beloved cousin, Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund). When he is on screen, no one can touch Peter O'Toole's (`Lawrence of Arabia') King Priam for royal demeanor, commanding perception, and aching love for his children and people. In his case, the baggage he brings from `Lawrence' and `Lion in Winter' serves him well.The battles are realistic, not quite as bloody or spiritual as the rout at Agincourt in Kenneth Branagh's magnificent  `Henry V.'  Pitt flies through the air like a stunt man from `Crouching Tiger,' and he is pumped up physically even more than he was in `Fight Club.' Although he is not yet an Oscar-worthy actor, he brings a commanding physical presence and delivery good enough to help me forget the stardust he carries.Homer would be happy with this `Iliad' adaptation even if the Trojan horse appears only in the `Odyssey' and Agamemnon's fate is reworked.  The spirit is for the ages, thousands of years later, when men still go to war for reasons other than love, occupy other countries at great peril, and die inexplicably happy to have their names emblazoned on memorials while families cope with profound loss.  Tennyson caught the mystery of why men would fight for a faithless woman when he described Helen with the `face that launched a thousand ships/and burnt the topless towers of Ilium.' Troy or Iraq, Achilles or Rumsfeld, wars and warriors are forever caught in the myths of Troy faithfully and sympathetically rendered in Wolfgang Petersen's version, an enjoyable and memorable blockbuster to complement a summer of real war and conflicted citizenry.",Null,0,2,12 May 2004
Just Go with It," Comic relief in the 'dead zone.'
","Although Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler are not the caliber of Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant, they are a well-matched comedic couple in Just Go with It. When they're not engaged in a typical rom-com moment that makes them a loving couple (sorry about the spoiler, but you knew it anyway), they are scrappy and witty, making me almost believe they don't love each other.This story of plastic surgeon Danny (Sandler) having his assistant, Katherine (Aniston), act as his divorcing wife so he can snag 23-year-old-hottie Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) is boilerplate rom-com, but not bad at that. The slapstick and repartee are sometimes above average, and Sandler with Katherine's two children is right at home at what he does best: kind-hearted and funny and always ready to let the child actors upstage him. For instance, Bailee Madison as Katherine's daughter, Maggie, steals scenes with her fake Brit accent and overall chutzpah emanating from her strong personality first evident in Disney's Bridge to Terabithia. Sandler is brilliant with her, playing off her aggressiveness with his own low-key but smart responses. He brings out the best in everyone every time he relinquishes control of the scene.It's a good film as well that lets Nicole Kidman goof a little as Katherine's college rival; the two facing off in a Hawaiian hip-swaying contest is an amusing display of talent and toning, not bad at all for ladies who are getting as long in the tooth as Sandler. Not all the secondary characters are as fun: Comic relief from Nick Swardson as silly buddy Eddie is tediously forced.The comedy has all the requisite turns of the genre, all the clichés, and all the telegraphed twists. However, Just Go with It is a pleasant surprise in this movie dead zone before the Oscar winner announcements.",Null,0,2,12 February 2011
Brokeback Mountain," A majestic tale.
","'This is a celebration of individual freedom, not of homosexuality. No government has the right to tell its citizens when or whom to love. The only queer people are those who don't love anybody.' Feminist Rita Mae Brown (1982, about the opening of the Gay Olympics in San Francisco) It's time for America to face the fact that gay life is an integral part of diverse American life. No better vehicle for certifying that alliance is film and its best picture of 2005, Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee's majestic tale about two lonely cowboys who find love in the wilds of Wyoming during endless nights of shepherding couldn't be a better introduction to gay love for those of us who avoid the subject out of sheer ignorance or outdated notions of the right way human beings should mate. The film, however, could be enjoyed for the stunning photography of Alberta, which lends a lyricism to the story, a grandeur that raises the conflicts to the level of high nature, where prejudice and betrayal have no place.It's been more than 50 years since Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar hinted that cowboys were not all Marlboro men nor wanted to be; Brokeback takes less than a half an hour to entangle its protagonists in the bedding of a small tent. The entanglement of the rest of their lives is the purview of the rest of the film, which like that love scene, carefully reveals the layers of prejudice, outside but mostly within themselves, that they must struggle with to find emotional peace.You can see that sex has not been an essential ingredient of this film; rather Lee shows the painful longing that hiding love brings, the disorientation it offers to the wives who may or may not know the double lives of their husbands but who suffer with their husbands the dislocation of emotions that reach for permanent and proprietary status. But this is as modern life should be portrayed with people leading productive lives while dealing with hidden powers of love bursting to be born. Remains of the Day expresses the same theme but in a wholly different setting and without sex to mess things up.Lee's reverence for this complexity reminds me of the celluloid closet atmosphere in such movies as Howard Hawks' Red River (1948) with John Wayne. The latent homosexuality between cowboys Matt (Montgomery Clift) and Cherry (John Ireland) is hinted at when Cherry, handling Matt's gun, says to Matt, 'You know, there are only two things more beautiful than a good gun: a Swiss watch or a woman from anywhere. You ever had a Swiss watch?' And that's about as much as we got almost 60 years ago. Thank goodness for the openness of modern times.",Null,7,9,22 December 2005

Moreover, he's saying this to a reporter of Portuguese descent, Mike Rezendas (Mark Ruffalo). These two outsiders and new editor Marty Baron (Lieve Schreiber) are the lethal combination for an investigation at the turn of this century of Catholic priests' child abuse in the diocese and by extension, the world.Spotlight, a title referring to the name of the special Boston Globe long-term investigative team, is as much a thriller as a docudrama. To watch these professional journalists develop the case against the pedophiles and the church hierarchy is to see more clearly the mistakes made by the broadcast journalists of Truth, which chronicles the sourcing of the story about then President Bush's military performance.Dan Rather and his team would have done well to learn from the Globe reporters' dogged pursuit of sources, with supporting evidence against more than 70 priests. With the year's most under acting but most universally great acing, Spotlight is a delight to see. The dialogue, of which the film is mostly composed, by director Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, is full of smart observations and an energy that keeps the film moving at a pace commensurate with the rapid unfolding of the investigation.One of the film's strengths is its unwillingness to overplay its points. Because the Globe had this crime information 20 years before and buried it in the Metro section, the case has been unfolding glacially, and the film respects the slow pace of the disclosure by providing no smoking gun or moment of epiphany—just clues strewn in its own paper ages ago. Reclaiming those stories and adding to them are the basis for the case against the Church, best represented by Archbishop Law, who notoriously reassigned his errant priests when they were caught.Spotlight will have an Oscar spotlight if only for the best ensemble of the year together with unparalleled spot-on writing.

Terminator Salvation," Entertaining Summer Blockbuster
","'We've been fighting a long time. We are out numbered by machines. Working around the clock, without quit. Humans have a strength that cannot be measured. This is John Connor. If you are listening to this, you are the resistance.' John Connor (Christian Bale) If you are reading this review, you probably know more about the Terminator legend than I do, or at least as much because of Arnold Schwarzenegger's role in the original Terminator and the fascination about the relationship between humans and machines. It's 2018, not far from now, and Skynet has the upper hand, not a cellular phone company but the system governing machines that rule the world.John Connor (Christian Bale) is the leader of the resistance, and we, the audience are asked to suspend our belief about warping time (first Star Trek this summer, now Terminator), where a hero might meet his first officer or dad or Helena Bonham Carter, or a bad reproduction of Arnold. At any rate, director McG and the Catwoman writers have woven into the metal mélange of this sci-fi fantasy allusions to the Holocaust's boxcars of death, Mad Max's tangled landscapes, Apocalypse Now's menacing helicopter missions, and The Wizard of Oz's hopeful heart. Along the way are subtle references to futile wars such as in Iraq and the need for leadership over dictatorship. Terminator tries too much, but, hey, better than not at all or a film like Miss March.While the film spends precious little time with any theme other than mankind vs. machines, it has non-stop action for a summer blockbuster well worth the time unless you decide to take off for the future, a dicey business at best, as any of this film's heroes can attest. 'I knew it. I knew it was coming. But this is not the future my mother warned me about. And in this future, I don't know if we can win this war. This is John Connor.'",Null,4,12,20 May 2009
Insomnia," I doubt anyone seeing moody thriller `Insomnia' will fall asleep during its tortuous ride through Alaska's forbiddingly beautiful valleys and glaciers.
","I doubt anyone seeing moody thriller `Insomnia' will fall asleep during its tortuous ride through Alaska's forbiddingly beautiful valleys and glaciers. Detective Al Pacino comes to Alaska from Los Angeles to help solve the grizzly murder of a seventeen-year old girl.  Along with him is a partner who is ready to tell Internal Affairs about matters that may put the heroic Pacino's reputation in jeopardy.Robin Williams is the alleged murderer.  Enough said.  The value of this Chris Nolan (`Memento') film is not so much in the confluence of the Alaskan murder and the L.A. I.A. investigation as it is in the meeting of these gifted Oscar winners.  When I wanted to see Pacino and De Niro in `Heat,' I remember being disappointed in the number of one shots and reaction shots which suggested the 2 actors may not have been together for some of those takes.  Not so in `Insomnia'-not only are Pacino and Williams in a series of two shots, they complement each other so well you think you are dreaming. Pacino resists his usual ranting, probably sensing that a weary insomniac couldn't; Williams underplays with a hint of crazed perversity befitting his character.Oscar winner Hilary Swank has a weakly written part as the young Alaskan detective learning from Pacino. Even her great smile can't distract us from Pacino and Williams. She does have the best analysis of the films thematic dilemma: `Good cops can't sleep because that missing piece of the puzzle keeps them awake. Bad cops can't sleep because of their conscience.' As he did in `Memento,' Nolan keeps you awake wondering about the accuracy of knowledge and the integrity of the law.But conscience makes cowards of us all, and sleep in the relentless Alaskan sun comes not to the troubled.  As Hamlet said: `To sleep? Perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.'`Insomnia' is a dream of an acting showcase with cinematographer Wally Pfister landscapes that become another satisfying dark character. You'll not pause or sleep in this satisfying thriller.",Null,0,0,21 May 2002
Aquaman," He can swim, he can fight, and that's about it. Great for kids, not so much adults.
","'It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea . . . .' Edgar Allen Poe's Annabel LeeWhile the women in the audience for character Aquaman/Arthur can ogle Jason Momoa's fit pecs, the men can enjoy the young Amber Heard 's beauty as Princess Mera and for a bonus, that of the nicely-put-together Nicole Kidman as the matriarch Atlanna. And that's all there is folks, at least for adults. For 8-year-old boys, explosions and fights excitingly occupy almost all the film.
Aquaman/Arthur's reluctant struggle to find the magic trident (think a sword in a stone and claim his right to be king of Atlantis follows the usual mythical arc which includes fighting the evil brother, King Orm (Patrick Wilson), and finding the trident. Like the legendary King Arthur, this Arthur must wrest the trident from a monster, not a stone. Otherwise director James Wan can cut back to the lighthouse and Arthur's real father, Temuera (a fit Tom Curry), who waits patiently for the return from the sea of his mermaid wife, Atlanna.
Usually some relief can be had in the CGI setting under water, but here the scenes are so dense with creatures and ruins and, yes, explosions, that you can't digest it all and may end up not appreciating any. Nor can you possibly give a pass for Willem Dafoe, the true actor, with Kidman, in the whole lot. Because I just saw Dafoe play a memorable Vincent van Gogh in Edge of Eternity, I am miffed that he would play the king's vizier, with one line worthy of his acting ability and not any another.Jason Momoa, formerly of a Conan remake, is a physically-appealing choice, for previous iterations have him blonde, blue-eyed, and Thor like rather than the more interesting smoky-eyed, long-tressed surfer/biker dude here. Beyond the physical attributes, Momoa is given next-to-none smart lines or anything to help develop his character.Oh, well, 8-year old boys win this round. Yet, a fetching Kidman can be its own reward for us caregivers.",Null,4,11,21 December 2018
500 Days of Summer," It's about time . . .
","'This is not a love story. This is a story about love.' NarratorBecause I've been in love more than once, and not always successfully, I'm grateful for the dose of reality that underpins (500) Days of Summer—a romantic comedy hitting the common-sense chord regularly and sweetly. Despite the above narrator's disclaimer, this is a love story that takes a different path than the usual romcom, and it does discourse about love as it depicts lovers in battle.The two leads, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and indie favorite Zooey Deschanel as Summer, are as cute as could possibly be, playing young lovers who look as if they were meant to be together—but wait, I get ahead of myself.From the get-go, Tom is not in the power position because Summer is forthright that she does not want a boyfriend or a relationship. What she actually wants is not fully disclosed, a lack of transparency when this almost two hander doesn't disclose her motivation to avoid romantic entanglement, a philosophy that doesn't appear in the denouement. Tom's depressing job as a writer of vapid greeting cards reinforces the dead-end doom of lyrical love.As romantic comedies go, this is a cut above this summer's fare (remember My Life in Ruins): the 'buddies' are not slackers although one is a bit of an airhead; the challenges are credible; and most of all, the expectations for a regular comedy to end well are not met. In short, the romance is troubled from the beginning because of Summer's unusual attitudes about freedom and Tom's unwillingness to face up to the reality that the one woman in his life may not be the right one.Throughout the film we are reminded of time, specifically the 500 days, by regular notices about what day of the relationship the next scene is in. The jumble of time works because we know when the scene is set, regardless of whether or not the story is linear.Toward the end, a philosophy about fate is offered as an antidote to the confusions of love; it's about time someone asserted that love may not be ordained by fate.'Amor vincit omnia.'",Null,0,1,29 July 2009
Concussion," OMG--I used to play sandlot tackle football= no more!!
","'Why would a man take his own life at the age of 50?' Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith)For 28% of pro footballers, head problems not just restricted to dizziness are a result of the pounding every week in the NFL. Dr Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist, in Concussion, based on a true story, begins in 2002 the outside-of-the-league autopsies that will eventually expose the CTE impairment and other life-threatening results of the professional battering.As gently and convincingly played by Will Smith, the doctor eventually gets the NFL and world's attention by scientifically exploring the dead bodies of former players. As in the tobacco wars, the corporation, in this case the league, denies any connection, but that stand is bound to deteriorate as devoted scientists and doctors who know the players are forced to admit the causal relationship.The film is absorbing when it plays like a medical thriller, perhaps like something Michael Crichton would write in non science fiction. When Concussion tries to integrate the more melodramatic elements of Dr. Omalu's life such as his marriage and the couple's miscarriage, the film becomes mired in tears and melancholy, unfitting for a story worth telling about the professional struggle alone.Concussion's emphasis on the need for public awareness of the probable danger of tackle football is well presented, even though the NFL seems like a Bond villain's empire. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue started The Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury to explore the injuries and left the results with new commissioner, Roger Goodell.Although settlement for players ensued, the concussions are still around.",Null,13,26,24 December 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," Until hell freezes over!
","Until hell freezes over! Well, some people say New York City is hell, so it's fitting that Roland Emmerich's (`Godzilla,' `Independence Day') `Day After Tomorrow' features the freezing of NYC, and the whole northern hemisphere for that matter, as a result of global warming.
This summer's disaster movie begins with an absurd premise about an instantaneous warming that leads to freezing in our lifetime and ends with the not absurd warnings about our planetary abuse of resources and the reliance we will eventually have on those third world nations we so subtly patronize. The satirical brush stroke is broad (The obtuse vice president very much resembles Cheney), and the denouement is the longest in the history of cinema (After the tsunami featured in the trailer, what else for an hour could you do to hold attention?). Climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who warned everyone about the impending disaster, trudges from D.C to New York to be with his stranded son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal). It takes him just a bit longer than it would on the Baltimore-Washington Expressway in the non-ice age, so what's the big deal? Nothing! The movie was over already. The subplots like Jack's humanitarian ex-wife doctor (Sela Ward) with a terminal child are tangential and ridiculous against the backdrop of people burning rare manuscripts in the NYC Metro Library just to stay alive.  Jack's heroics are pretty funny given he is the only one with the computer program to figure out this climate mess, and he is hiking to NY to see his kid. Don't get me wrong; I loved the opening helicopter shots of Antarctica, the CGI of frozen New York, and the overall warming warning.  But when Emmerich inexplicably introduces rogue wolves and drops off the intriguing Ian Holm as a prescient professor in favor of Quaid snow shoeing to NYC, then I'm just disappointed in what could have been.  `Poseidon Adventure' is the director's favorite disaster film; there is something universal and memorable there that is not present in `Day After Tomorrow.' If you watch `Meteor,' `Sudden Impact,' or `The Core,' you'll also find the disaster formula disappointingly presented.Yet, I enjoyed the 2 hours.  Go figure! It's summertime!",Null,0,0,27 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Old Hat
","'I don't get it.' Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow about the tradition of throwing hats in celebration I don't get it either, the hysteria about the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogyit's old hat by now. The computer graphics have always been eye-catching, the makeup charmingly realistic, and the actors about as good as you get in film. I just tire of Johnny Depp imitating Johnny Depp playing Captain Jack Sparrow, a gender bending hero for our summers.In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, everyone, including Elizabeth (Kira Knightly) is headed for Pirate Brethren Court in Singapore, where they must prepare for a great battle with the evil British empire or become extinct, not a possibility as long as a lucrative film empire can continue steal admissions from a willing audience.Although I think of the franchise as child's fare, the opening sequence of a child being hanged with a bunch of greasy street characters singing a dirge on an elaborate gallows makes me realize this film is not easy to categorize. It can be creative, albeit macabre. But that is the opening sequence; thereafter the film stretches for freshness.That lack of definition carries for me right from Dead Man's Chest, where the only consistency is Depp's Sparrow. His erratically fey swishbuckler is old hat by now, his speech so eccentric that subtitles might not be a bad idea, exceeded only by Naomie Harris as a garbling, black-toothed oracle, who might as well be talking to the wind for all she can be understood. The cameo by Keith Richard as Jack's dissolute dad (it doesn't fall far from the tree) just isn't the kick I had hoped, and not just because he can't be understood.Kira Knightly's Elizabeth remains the only character with good teeth, and Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, her main man, is more mature and more likeably able than ever. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, still breathing through his spore and badly in need of a facial, has nothing new to add to the fun except as the jailer of Sparrow and ruler of a most chaotic kingdom under the sea.Jack Sparrow may next travel to the fountain of youth, where I hope he'll pick up some aqua vitae for the franchise.",Null,0,1,28 May 2007
Deadpool 2," It's irreverant and fun just like the original.
","'You're so dark. Are you sure you're not from the DC universe?' Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds)Deadpool 2, another Marvel marvel, has no problem referring to its rival DC universe, taking self-referential quipping to the referential and making a pretty good joke at the same time. Typically, Reynolds, as Deadpool/Wade and one of the writers, is foul-mouthed, irreverent, and downright rude, or exactly the opposite of the socially-upright superheroes we've grown accustomed to.
That's the point. To satirize the super-hero convention is what Deadpool 2 and its original do, and they do it well. No trope is safe: from proper, laconic speech to selfless heroism; all are fodder for the foul. As X-Men trainee, Deadpool still has to prove himself worthy of a spot like Wolverine's, a rival about whom Deadpool is obsessed.Saving a young boy (Julian Dennison), who has revenge on his mind because of abuse in an orphanage, from becoming a murderer like the rest of the 'X Force,' Deadpool gets involved with hunter-from-the future Cable (Josh Brolin, in his second badass Marvel character this year-the other being Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War). These two rival the humorous connections in Butch Cassidy and Die Hard and countless 'buddy' films.Deadpool is not all explosions and wisecracks, for topics such as racism and sexism crop up without hitting the audience heavily. Perhaps the most prevalent motif is the need for family, by now a staple of super-hero flicks, along with the need for love.Clean as that sounds, this is not a family film any more than Bad Santa. Yet, for adults it's a needed antidote to the dark DC universe and a comic upgrade from regular family-friendly summer sci-fi adventures. Funny and self-referential it is: 'You know what we need to do? We need to build a f*****g team. We need 'em tough, morally flexible, and young enough so they can carry this franchise 10-12 years.'

Spider-Man 3," An amusement suffering by comparison with its predecessor.
","Like a middle-aged man on a mission, Spider-Man 3 sags in the middle, takes a while to get somewhere, but still likes the girls, swells a progress or two, and shows some of the old idealism that fights with maturity's pragmatism. Most disappointing of all is this pre-mid-life hero, Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), obsessed with his love, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and his desire to marry her.Enough already. He needs to save New York from the Sandman (an interesting new villain played by a fine actor, Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace). Director Sam Raimi, who knows a thing or two about split-personality Spider-Men and the evil forces overcoming good men with his Simple Plan, indulges his melodramatic longings through most of the film's mid section with the endless exchanges between Peter and MJ.Raimi does do well with the dueling good and evil theme, starting with Peter's sudden change brought on by black globs from another world. When he supposedly eliminates the Sandman for murdering his uncle, Peter is confounded by his will to do it and his moral compass, which keeps getting into his conscience. Even the Sandman struggles between his devotion to his little girl and acting like King Kong to scare the heck out of Manhattanites. Raimi does a service to the youngsters of the audience by stressing the importance of choices, a kind of comic-book existentialism.But Marvel Comics and Stan Lee live on. Yet, at 139 minutes (12 more minutes than SM2), SM3 is 39 minutes too long, notwithstanding the outstanding FX. SM 2 was much better, not just because Pulitzer-winner Michael Chabon was one of the writers, but because it took Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) so seriously he seemed to have more lines than Dunst, who here is petulant and self-centered enough to lose my interest. As I wrote in 2004, Spider-Man 2 'is a movie to draw you firmly and forever into its warm web, even more than the original did.'

Thor: Ragnarok," Satisfying muscular myth and light humor.
","'Asgard is not a place, it's a people.' Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor: Ragnarok is about saving a homeland, Asgard, but eventually not the physical land. It's all about the people, a gentle allusion to the plight today of immigrants who have become travelers while bringing home with them. People leaving in a space ship like an ark carry the Biblical heft and a swashbuckling sci-fi adventure.So the redeeming element of these heroic films from Marvel, and DC for that matter, is the cultural mash up that reflects our civilization's abiding interest in how we can become better than we are, i.e., becoming super heroes, and yet retain the sweet, flawed humanity we were meant to be. The pervasive humor in quips and self deprecation is a welcome humane ingredient and a sign that the super hero genre is maturing.In Thor :Ragnorak, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is not just a hemmer-throwing, muscle bound cutie; he is a young man dealing with the death of his father, Odin; the mischief of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston); and the devastating power of his sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), the goddess of death. A bit more severe than yours and my families, but in a figurative way, just the same with its challenging relationships that sometime seem bloody.Although these space citizens are years ahead of us, they still fight with broadswords and machine guns, confirming our cultural awareness that battles will never really be different because they reside in the mind. From Greeks through now, we have been fascinated by our highs and lows, our greatness and our flaws, be it in Oedipus Rex or Willy Lowman.There will always be a place for hubris in our theater and films, and although the time and technology may differ, we still love and deplore our bloodlines as we work our way to dusty death. This Thor carries too many explosions for my taste, but the sociological thunderstorms are satisfyingly entertaining and sometimes downright allegorical.",Null,33,58,1 November 2017
Match Point," Allen doesn't need Manhattan to be a great director.
","'Luck, bad if not good, will always be with us. But it has a way of favoring the intelligent and showing its back to the stupid.' John Dewey, Human Nature and Conduct.For the first time since Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), I can spy a theme in a Woody Allen film that unifies the work through social combat and thriller suspense. Match Point is a decidedly unfunny Woodman work, more a satire of Brits and Americans than even a discourse on the wages of sin. But overall, Allen emphasizes the randomness of the universe, a slick reprisal of his nihilistic notions that have always posited luck a bigger player in the universe than God.Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) a tennis coach in London, hooks up with an exceedingly wealthy family, marries into it, and carries on a dangerous liaison with his brother-in-law's fiancée, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), an American actress and less-accomplished social climber than Chris. Like Allen himself, Chris is adept at crashing social barriers (Where more challenging can that be than in England?) and remaining on top through whatever means are available. That similarity is the best I can do for those who want to see another Woody clone as the lead (Will Farrell's bumbler in Melinda, Melinda comes immediately to mind) because Allen is determined in this film to prove his thesis about luck, to hell with older-guy neuroses and Annie Hall-like sweethearts.As an Anglophile, I was delighted with cinematography that crisply makes love to London without overwhelming the audience (One shot reminds me I still have to ride the 'Eye' and another, from the window of Chris's new digs on the Thames, reminds me how expensive yet stunning the right apartment can be in a great world city). The high artistry of lens shows Allen doesn't need Manhattan to be a great director.Match Point will remind some of the tragic triangle in Dreiser's American Tragedy (more to the point, George Stevens's adaptation in film, A Place in the Sun). For those who think Mr. Rhys-Myers is the newest Jude Law, the character resembles Patricia Highsmith's Ripley, whom Law played in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Die-hard Woody fans will relish the tossed off references to Dostoyevsky and Strindberg, both of which have thematic relevance for the former's interest in punishment ant the latter's attitude toward women. Beyond these signposts, Allen has hidden his persona in order to offer an entertaining lesson about the injustice of luck in a random universe.",Null,0,1,29 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," 'We'll always have Paris.'
","'Paris, France is exciting and peaceful.' Gertrude SteinWelcome to the world of Woody Allen as he has always loved it: nostalgic, romantic, imperfect, and full of hope. Midnight in Paris is one of his finest treatises on the lure and delusions of the past: Like Zelig it depicts other times, like Purple Rose of Cairo it uses magic realism to deal squarely with the present. Allen has another of his surrogates, this time Gil (Owen Wilson),who virtually experiences the past (the twenties) while dealing with the troublesome present.Gil, engaged to marry Inez (Rachel McAdams), is with her and her parents on business in Paris where he hopes to work on his novel while he is still a successful Hollywood writer. Although she is a materialist who would like him to become wealthy to enjoy the life his parents are used to, he dreams of escaping the hack work of LA and living in the City of Lights for inspiration, just as his idols Fitzgerald and Hemingway did in the roaring twenties.Well, the twenties roar back to him as he experiences their friendship and the mentoring of Gertrude Stein, among just a few of the many expatriate luminaries he meets through the magic of nostalgia. Just one of the Allen signature touches that make him the equal of great European directors such as Rohmer and Godard is opening the film with music that reflects the allure of the twenties, the romance of Paris, and his abiding love for this city: 'Si Tu Vois Ma Mere' by Sidney Bechet combines jazz, the clarinet, the twenties, and Allen with a romantic nostalgia.Owen Wilson catches the halting diffidence of the typical Allen persona without slavishly imitating him. Yet whatever little duplication Wilson employs endears as he sweetly visits his heroes, falls in love, and comes to terms with his writer's voice and his mismatched engagement. But that engagement is the troublesome present; the past offers the chance to experience history on a human level that only someone who writes for now and reveres the past can do. The magic and the realism, both requiring hard work from the protagonist, lead to surprising understanding of human nature, the delusion of nostalgia and Paris, and hope for a present that brings love and inspiration.'For all we know, Paris might be the hottest place in the universe.'

The Prestige," An illusion of a magic thriller.
","The Prestige begins as does The Illusionist (2006): Magic tricks in the 19th century that astound the audience in the film and in front of it. The difference is that Prestige offers the secrets of many tricks where Illusionist bares few if any. Perhaps that difference reveals a figurative distance between the similar films: Prestige keeps an emotional distance, as do its characters, while Illusionist is very much about love between a man and a woman with the illusions serving that love. Indeed, 'prestige' from the Middle French means illusion and tricks.The Prestige tells of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), rivals for a lifetime. Their intense competition centers around being the best magician in London, a feat mostly connected with Borden's electromagnetic transporting a man in a split second to somewhere else. Angier wants the secret, and that's no secret in the film, nor that both men share the affection of Angier's assistant, played by the increasingly curvaceous Scarlett Johansson.The convolutions of plot are no surprise coming from Christopher Nolan of Memento fame. The downside is that the plot becomes repetitious, especially as it circles the doppelganger motif. Truth and illusion are served well, many times over, until redundancy and boredom set in, certainly for this reviewer who usually loves ambiguity and paradox.A 'prestige' is the final stage of a trick, the one that brings back whatever had vanished and asserts the magician's preeminence. This film did not bring back for me the terror of the trick as Illusionist did. The trick is probably that Prestige looks like The Illusionist but is an illusion of just such a magic thriller.",Null,16,74,15 October 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Superman is gone.
","Prince Nuada: (to Hellboy) That's your weapon of choice? Hellboy: (flexing his stone hand) Five fingered Mary!Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a helluva hoot, a complement to and departure from the spate of superhero films this summer such as Iron Man, Hancock, Incredible Hulk, and Indiana Jones. The complementing part is obvious: super powers, super problems, super egos, super genre revisioning. The departure is the entrance into the parodic genre stage, where satire dominates.Hellboy (Ron Perlman's voice) and his rag-tag comrades from the special Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense include the fiery Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and the delicate Aquaman (Abe Sapien). They must quell a rebellion by a mythical world of creatures that have held back by treaty from fighting humans until the re-emergence of their bellicose Prince Nuada (Luke Goss). Ironic it is that the hellspawn Red has been rejected by both worlds.The laughs are constant, as the opening dialogue here indicates, and usually from Perlman's Hellboy, such as when he calls his new boss, Germanic Johann Krauss (John Alexander and James Dodd), who is a protoplasmic bureaucrat with a window-like pate, a 'glasshole,' and then moves on to smoke his Cuban cigar. The days of upright, uptight Superman are gone. What remains is a combination of Will Smith's hung-over, bad-boy Hancock and Robert Downey's self-indulgent but emerging community-mindedness. Both of these traits are superimposed with an incessant wisecracking that endears Red to the audience and encourages it to forget perfection and enjoy the child-like fun of breaking the rules and poking fun at authority. Allusions to many sci-fi and fantasy classics abound, most assuredly the market scenes from Star Wars are easily recognized and the ravenous tooth-faerie like creatures could be straight from Lord of the Rings. Drunken Red and Abe singing along to sappy Barry Manilow's 'Can't Smile Without You' is a classic moment of pop-cult satire.Blazing Saddles defined this parodic stage of the genre cycle, using the Western's many clichés and poking fun at its conventions (the flatulent campfire is most notable).

Cloverfield," An annual craving
","'I saw it. It's alive!' Terrorized New Yorker in Cloverfield My favorite monster is from Forbidden Planet because I never see it;the anticipation is fearful. In a similarly minimalist approach, the monster in Cloverfield appears later in the film, but the camera never lingers. Good for director Matt Reeves: Less is more.In the spirit of Blair Witch, the terror of New York City is enhanced by total-film hand-held camera, a story told by a twenty- something who has been recording a party and keeps his camera going through the destruction of lower Manhattan as he and his friends try to evacuate.In the spirit of Godzilla, the monster is bigger than hell and angry.In the spirit of 9/11, panic is married to disbelief, a potent cocktail for women crying and men running. The camera, although annoying when I have to watch it jiggling for over an hour, is nevertheless effective in creating a sense of immediacy and danger, transporting me to the site as I maneuver with the actors through present peril.The biggest casualty is characterization; notice I have not mentioned one name so far, and I won't because horror is the main attraction.It's no field of clover, but Cloverfield will delight you if you long to see New York brought to its knees from the safety of your seat.

Once," Just right for a true romance.
","Once in a while a musical is fresh and new: Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You was attention-getting when his ordinary actors broke into song as if they were off the streets of a 1930's musical. Baz Lurhmann's Moulin Rouge! took the genre to expressionistic flights. And now back to earth in John Carney's Once, a realist drama/musical set in contemporary Dublin; here a street singer seems to fall in love with a passing by young woman with Hoover vacuum repair needs, which he can do in his day job.And that's about ittwo lonely people, one separated from his unfaithful love and the other from her Czech husband. This 2007 Sundance Audience Award winner never strays from the documentary style while, as in Woody's film, songs break out but with much more natural flow. The truthfulness comes from Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Frames, and Marketa Irglova, a Czech musician he has known and worked with before. Their love and respect for each other make their performances two of the best this year.Neither lead has a name, so it's easy to universalize their experience: the uncertainty of love, emphasized by her unsubtitled Czech response to his question about whether she still loves her husband or not, and the unglamorous ties each person has to a mate, albeit estranged as in this case. The love that has grown for these two impoverished artists is expressed in the songs, first about lost love and then about present love. Hansard has charisma that demands you listen to the lyrics while you enjoy his melody; Irglova's accompanying piano and voice reveal the heart of a poet and the pluck of a heroine.Director John Carney was a member of the Frames, so his understanding of their Gaelic themes and Hansard's talent makes an engaging musical romance. The additional touch of documentary style (some hand held, jittery camera; some blurry close-ups) gives cred to the everyman aura of two talented people finding love without making love and finding song to express that maddening occurrence of being beholden to someone else and determined to do the right thing, not a recipe for lyrical music but a sweet, melancholy score just right for a true romance.",Null,1,3,13 June 2007
Ready Player One," Spielberg makes an exciting call home again.
","Steven Spielberg's world has always been virtual realities of adventure and nostalgia, from King Kong and T Rex toIndiana Jones and ET to Close Encounters. Once again in Ready Player One he goes adventure- fantastical into the gamers' world of the virtual where a hunt for an egg can be Easter's annual hunt or a serious search for happiness among goggles and graft. This film is solid Spielberg, not great Spielberg but with enough pop-cult allusions to please even the most fervid geek.Young Parzival (Tye Sheridan) is the likeliest gamer to discover the three keys that will win the Easter egg and the vast Oasis empire, which has enslaved the world to games, and my Columbus, Ohio, in 2045. More like 'mesmerized' because the world of trash and piled-high trailers or 'stacks' is what the virtual gamers like him are hoping to escape. No need for me, at least, to see how our civilization, and my precious city, is in danger of enslavement by smart phones. Just look anywhere in public to see the absorption technology engenders to the exclusion of old-fashioned socializing.Recently I was a visiting professor at a high-end college classroom. As I walked in 10 minutes before class, every one of the 13 students was on a smart phone. Very depressing image about a time I used to cherish as an undergrad to gossip and schmooze face to face.It's not difficult to figure out Spielberg's game of warning us all about our consuming games and more universally, smart phones. Yet that acclaimed director keeps his childlike fascination with the complexities of family and love, as Tye, like us, finds there's no place like the home and love, the latter the most real place on earth. Although the film misses the intimacy and poetry of his greatest hits, it provides enough adventure and sentiment to please the general public.Great director Spielberg can dazzle with graphics lovely to behold and still juxtapose those fantasies with real world shenanigans, bad guys and all. You'll want to find a zero-gravity dance hall right after the movie; Spielbergean sentiment will have you do it with your best love, not some virtual fantasy.",Null,2,8,28 March 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Intelligence for the intelligent
","'It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. The West has become so ugly.' The defector's rationaleGrab a Beefeaters, put on the fire, and get ready for a Cold War spy tale chill and dense with just enough information to keep you interested but not enough to figure out who's the defector until the very end: 'There's a mole, right at the top of the Circus. And he's been there for years.'If you get your kicks out of Bond or Bourne, then be prepared for the less athletic, unsexy world of real espionage as George Smiley (Gary Oldman) returns from retirement in British intelligence, or the 'Circus' as it's called, to find the Russian defector in its highest ranks.You're right there in the early '70's, not computer driven and considerably less frenetic than intelligence work depicted in cinema today. But that grey cinematography and drab operatives may come closer to the minimalist reality of plodding intelligence work than the gadgets and gymnastics of contemporary cinema's takes on spies: 'For twenty-five years we've been the only thing standing between Moscow and the Third World War!' Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds)Based on the John le Carré novel, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is an engaging film about intelligence for intellectuals—slow, serious, and more like chess between Holmes and Moriarity than banter between Bond and Goldfinger. Certainly don't expect a Bond babe like Pussy Galore. Oh, there's blood alright but at a British reserve amount yet always a reasonable circumstance from the first shooting in a café to a final rifle shot.It's more like a fox hunt where the trappings and the talk eclipse the final take of animal and movie.

The Hateful Eight," To know Tarantino, you must see this explosive oater.
","'One of them fellas'll kill everybody in here...' John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) Quentin Tarantino movies, such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, linger like pop culture artifacts long into the memories of geeks and movie lovers. The Hateful Eight will follow along those lines with its emphasis on light-hearted violence that supports themes of racism sexism, and nationalism, among others.'The Hangman' bounty hunter John Ruth is transporting Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be hanged in Red Rock, and Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) has a couple of dead bodies to be transported in the same stage coach for collecting his bounty. Stuck at a way station in a Wyoming storm in post-Civil War, they and five other shady types spend two days sizing each other up and eliminating the bounty competition.Underneath the gruff exterior of each eccentric character is a point the gifted director is making: Daisy is a woman, most unusual to be hanged in any age, but just as unlikeable and ornery as any of the rotten men--a sure-fire comment on today's egalitarian military.Warren is regularly referred to as 'Nigger,' reminding us that racism is both in our history over a hundred years ago and our present. Yet, he commands the stage as he demands respect even to claiming a personal letter from President Lincoln, a comment on the liberation of blacks long ago and the lingering combat with whites.Some will be put off by the pervasive violence. However, violence is a part of the Tarantino experience, a statement about the dangerous culture we live in and the need to trivialize it in order to defeat it.Besides, some of the film's humor comes from the unexpected mayhem and t casual way characters commit it (think Travolta and Jackson characters in Pulp Fiction). Fortunately most of the characters seem to deserve their fates, making the experience cathartic to some degree.Because much of the action takes place inside the station, Tarantino is able to compose his shots like a stage play in which the antagonists can face off against each other in the frame, whose 70 mm projection allows for serious space between to emphasize their individual isolation. That's not to say the director is negligent in his wide open shots outdoors--the snow covered landscape with the six horse stage coaches in the distance is thrillingly made for the 70 mm. A nomination should be forthcoming.Although The Hateful Eight is not my favorite Western, as The Magnificent Seven is, it ranks next to Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles and Tarantino's Django Unchained for tickling me about the genre I grew up on.'Now, what would make a man brave a blizzard and kill in cold blood? I'm sure I don't know! You'd be surprised what a man would do . . . .' Major Marquis Warren",Null,2,16,3 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," Tonya's rough and elegant, a tough combo for figure skating.
","'I mean, come on! What kind of friggin' person bashes in their friend's knee? Who would do that to a friend?' Tonya Harding (Margot Robie)Director Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya may change the way you view Tonya Harding. This gritty docudrama chronicles the life of the competitive skater who worked a lifetime to become a member of the Olympic team only to see the dream shattered by her ex, Jeff (Sebastian Stan) in the now infamous assault on superior skater Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver).Although Tonya admits to coming from 'white trash,' she dreams of entering a world that mostly coddles to girls from proper families, hardly a term for the Hardings. Their incessant smoking and Eskimo-Pie eating are small reminders of how difficult she would have it in the culturally rarefied world of Olympic competition.Tonya displays an astounding naivetÃ© as she places her confidence in boyfriend turned abusive husband, Jeff (Sebastian Stan). No question she knew he wanted to harass competitor Kerrigan through the mails, but she doesn't seem to have sanctioned assaulting her. Harding's hard shell makes it difficult to sympathize with her nevertheless. The crux of this revealing and ultimately sympathetic chronicle is that Harding, as bluntly competitive and rough as she is, is easily buffeted by her rude mother, La Vona (Allison Janney), whose drill sergeant ways and seeming lack of love set up Tonya for feelings of inadequacy for the Olympics and life.
 
The action of the film, well known for anyone aware of the turbulent 90's and Harding, arguably, as she says, secondly famous only to Bill Clinton, doesn't play as well as other docs that keep the audience on edge but eager for more. Harding is deeply in need of real love, a circumstance that gives the film less suspense than that of a more stable hero. I might even be challenged calling her a 'hero.'",Null,0,1,3 January 2018
Molly's Game," Another Wonder Woman only this time she's for real.
","'I don't trust People . . . . I have no heroes.' Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain)That pretty much characterizes the heroine of Molly's Game-a brilliant woman, Molly (Jessica Chastain), who, after suffering an Olympic skiing career-ending accident turns to running high-end gambling nights only to be indicted on illegal gambling charges. However, the real interest in this story is in the gutsy, implacable woman, based on Molly Bloom's book of the same name, who never flinches from her self regard and principles that remain constant throughout her life.She was Hollywood's 'poker princess' who at 26 ran games as pure as the snow she used to ski except at the end of her career when she deviated from her norms and became entwined with the feds, who hounded her into court. Chastain, together with Idris Elba as her smart lawyer, have moments of interaction that could be straight out of a 40's screwball comedy, typical from the pen of writer/director Aaron Sorkin, except that there's nothing amusing about the years in prison she was facing in the court room,What pleases me so much is we have, not a Wonder Woman, but a real woman with unusual intelligence maneuvering in a man's world of wealthy poker players. Besides stretching the rules a small amount of time and extending credit when she shouldn't, she shows a fortitude and intelligence that could be wish for anyone's daughter.Molly's game tells a true story with a modern, flawed heroine. She has four Aces to Lara Croft's two of a kind. Be a winner and see this commanding biopic portrayed by an actress who could be anyone's heroine.",Null,3,9,28 December 2017
The Adventures of Tintin," Great holiday fun from a premiere director
","Tintin: 'How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?' Captain Haddock: 'Unquenchable.'My best overall entertainment for the family at 2011 holiday time goes to Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. The motion-capture and 3-D enhance the action, ramp it up if you will so that you are immersed in the action and wondering at how life-like the characters are even though animated.Director Spielberg was reading the international serial books about young reporter/sleuth, Tintin, by Belgian artist Hergé, while working on his Indiana Jones franchise. It's easy to see the influences on both sides especially Spielberg's enduring child-like enthusiasm for adventure and his mastery of the camera point of view. We soar with planes and birds and spend not inconsiderable time up close with those expressive faces. As in the originals, this Tintin adaptation, set in mid-twentieth Europe, is episodic with numerous mini adventures young hero Tintin (Jamie Bell) goes through to find a 17th-century treasure that 1/3 of the map he found in a model ship points to. Sir Frances Haddock (Andy Serkis) long ago planted three parts of the map, and a sodden contemporary descendant, Captain Haddock (Serkis), helps Tintin and faithful dog, Snowy, recover his family's fortune and reputation.The action is non-stop, from motorcycle to seaplane (most of the vehicles Indiana Jones used as well), and the humor is pleasantly understated:Captain Haddock: 'So you thought you'd sneak in an' catch me with me trousers down, eh?' Tintin: 'Would rather you kept your trousers on if it's all the same to you.'Most of all it's Spielberg's infectious enthusiasm that carries the picture. If for nothing else, enjoy the visual references to his earlier movies like Jaws and Indiana Jones and marvel how storyteller Spielberg can adapt a well-known series, and with the help of computer graphics, imitate a world so much like his own.(in a plane) Captain Haddock: 'You do know what you're doing, right?'

Moana," Now this is a heroine. Thanks, Disney!
","'If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.' Maui (Dwayne Johnson)In animated Moana, the titular Polynesian heroine is also a Disney heroine: smart, feisty, beautiful, wearing a dress, and with a chicken for a sidekick. She is memorable the way a little mermaid or shining fish might be, but more so, because she represents so much of the Samoan and Maori cultures in addition to the impressive musical ones.Yet, maybe the most impressive musical bit comes more from David Bowie than the islands, a song rich about a gold crab's shell punctuated with vigor and humor. Because this is a Disney fantasy, most of the songs are about self actualization and empowerment especially tailored to a pre-teen looking to know who she is and why the ocean has chosen her to save her people.Director Ron Clements and writer Jared Bush show their chops once again by incorporating wit and diffidence in both the heroine and the demigod Maui, whom she seeks to save her people, who have been blighted by years of conservatism and isolationism ('Never go beyond the reef' is their mantra). The fertility that she exemplifies in the face of their sterility is emphasized finally by the closing shot of a beached sea shell.The Disney refrain of being who you are and who you want to be, while trite in the extreme given the animated history behind these toons, is fresh enough because it is existentially the place for any developing young person and because in these parlous times.Maona is an antidote for cynicism and a hallelujah for ethnic richness promoted by tribal music and dance and family values that feature respect for elders and emerging power for women. You go, Disney!",Null,4,15,13 December 2016
Ocean's Twelve," The heist film lives on.
","The heist film lives on every time a slick gang of bad boys and girls gathers to take something that doesn't belong to them, and we go along because these crooks are 'cool.' Three years ago in the very watchable Heist, Gene Hackman was a rough but competent jewel thief aided by the usual gang of helpers conning nasty fence Danny DeVito of his ill-gotten gains. That was then and the literate David Mamet (Spartan) was director. Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven came out that same year, a smooth caper film with hip actors such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon stealing a cool $150 million from casino owner Andy Garcia. Heist was a better character study; Ocean's Eleven was more fun.Ocean's Twelve brings back the same relaxed thieves plus Catherine Zeta-Jones in a more complicated project, three European robberies culminating in stealing a Faberge egg to assuage the vengeful anger of Andy Garcia's casino owner. Europe, especially the wide-open and beautiful Amsterdam, looks as inviting as ever, though Chris Connier's cinematography (Angela's Ashes) is nothing to write home about. The actors seem jet-lagged and the plot weary from trying to be ingenious and new while it is really tired and old.More intriguing than the de rigueur fashion clothes for this series is the addition of Vincent Cassel (Birthday Girl) as Francois Toulour, the superior thief arguably better than Danny Ocean but still not as good as the world's best, LeMarc (Albert Finney). Cassel's savoir-faire and dance among the museum's laser beams are welcome relief from the clichés of Clooney and gang. But continuing to enjoy even the most modest of heist films such as Ocean's Twelve, I come out of the theater with a smile although my admission dollars were stolen. As Shakespeare said in Othello, 'The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief.'I want to go back to Amsterdam but not with tired thieves. Give me an old but young Gene Hackman and a plot to keep the jet lag at bay.",Null,4,8,8 December 2004
BlacKkKlansman," Lee is a master of entertaining film and racial realism. Thiis is no exception.
","In the '70's race relations were détente at best, nowhere better exemplified than by the Colorado Springs Police Department, where black Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) was a detective. Not just any detective, for the true story of his infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan is smartly re-created by acclaimed director Spike Lee in BlacKkKlansman.Lee opens with a claim that sets his wide-ranging tone: 'Based on Some Fo' Real, Fo' Real.' His subsequent illustration with D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind, however, shows that the deeply serious subject of BlacKkKlansman is racial terrorism.The biography and satire are best at showing the racism still prevalent at that time, especially the Klan's fervid hatred of Jews and blacks. The infiltration of the Klan is uniquely pulled off by splitting up Stallworth into his white phone voice and in person using the white Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to substitute for Stallworth. When Lee uses Alec Baldwin to play a pro-segregation narrator who keeps fumbling and forgetting his lines, Lee is at his best with trenchant satire going down easily with a bit of humor. In some ways, this film approaches the brilliance of Lee's Do the Right thing.Lee, who inherited this project from Jordan Peele, keeps the action moving, as if it were a top cop show in the '70's with low-key humor and slow revelations accompanied by crisp performances and an air of professionalism. Most notably toward the end are Lee's obvious references to current authoritarian, racist administrators at the highest levels of society.The claim by one character that the level of bigotry and racism would never happen again received chuckles from our audience. Yet, more seriously from Mr. Lee himself:
'We are living in pure undiluted sanity. Families are being stripped apart, kids put in cages, that's going back to our ancestors being broken up and sold. That's the world we live in.'",Null,32,73,9 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spidey and Wonder rule this summer.
","'If you're nothing without the suit, then you shouldn't have it.' Tony Stark to his intern, Peter Parker/Spider-Man.If a superhero film such as Spider-Man: Homecoming can relay that being yourself is more important than being somebody, Director John Watts (director of the under-appreciated Cop Car with Kevin Bacon) and his crew of bright writers have succeeded. I don't remember enjoying more such a focused, albeit young, Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tom Holland), whose emotional problems are those of any teen and not overly driven by angst over a girl, as Tobey Maguire so often portrayed.While Peter experiences the challenges of teen love and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), the film keeps it personal by having fewer explosions and more introspection. Emphasizing Peter's existential responsibility to forge his own character makes this film a cut above even the estimable Wonder Woman this summer.The spot-on humor is better than any other superhero adventure in memory, and I'm a big Deadpool fan. The difference is that Spidey humor is organic, emanating from the foibles and insecurities of a teen, while in Deadpool practically every other line is witty and seems the product of set pieces. In Spidey, for instance, Ned (Jacob Batalon) asks Spidey, 'Can you summon an army of spiders?' That's teen to teen with absurdity and worship as comedic ingredients.In a fine bad-guy performance by Michael Keaton, playing Adrien Toombs, the writers give him the identity of Vulture, appropriate to an actor known for his portrayal of Birdman and reminiscent of Batman. Anyway, alluding to his most famous roles, the film has fun while enhancing the richness of the character.At times it almost seems that Toombs is there to lend some gravity, albeit villainous, to the light-hearted proceedings. When he lectures his crew about the ruling-class indifference, he's not just talking about Brooklyn; he's referring to the world: 'The rich, the powerful, like Stark, they don't care about us! The world's changed boys, time we change too!'Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fitting companion this summer to a distaff heroine, Wonder Woman. Unfortunately, Spidey is not all laughs, for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) tells Peter about adolescence while she unwittingly comments on his heroic burden: 'You need to stop carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.'",Null,5,16,4 July 2017
The Expendables," Best Action of Summer 2010
","'If the money's right, we don't care where the job is.' Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) I spend much of my film criticism time looking for quality films that I can praise and recommend; too often they're like Mademoiselle Chambon-- European and chatty. So how do I handle a guilty pleasure like Sylvester Stallone's action-overloaded Expendables? I advise, let yourself indulge, give yourself to the Rocky /Rambo retro-king, and enjoy the best cheesy pulp this summer 2010 (I know—The A-Team, Salt, and Knight and Day are the weak competition).Barney Ross (Stallone), a fit and aging adventurer, signs with his buddies, including the lethal Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), to overthrow General Garza (David Zayas) and the CIA rogue James Munroe (Eric Roberts), drug lords from a minor island. Because of the involvement of Garza's beautiful and estranged daughter, Sandra (Giselle Itie), Ross is highly motivated—the result is mayhem on a small Michael Bay scale but far more entertaining.Stallone is robust and sharp and Statham as Transporter-dangerous as ever. When they are flying their amphibious plane, the shots are so process-looking as to reinforce the idea that director Stallone is winking at the comic-book roots and our own recollection of pre-digital action poverty.The brief scenes with Bruce Willis and the uncredited cameo by Arnie are just the right touches of nostalgia and sarcasm to remind how much we miss these iconic albeit aging heroes. In addition, Eric Roberts has never been oilier, and the drug business never as vulnerable.But then, no drug lords could ever withstand Rocky and Rambo at the same time.",Null,3,11,25 August 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," And the gift is .. .
","Whether it be Alice going down the rabbit hole or, in Pan's Labyrinth, little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) descending a labyrinth in an imaginative flight from Franco fascists in 1994 Northern Spain, the escape of a girl into a fantasy world cries for allegorical interpretation. In the case of Pan's Labyrinth, no interpretation is difficult because the visuals are so strikingly Beauty and the Beast-ish (original version) that the oppression of good and the expression of love are self-evident.Capitan Vidal (The excellent Sergi Lopez) embodies Franco, Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin as the indomitable tyrant who hunts rebels like annoying flies. When the real worlds of fascism and imagination collide, there is a price for both sides to pay. The gift of the film is to make us wonder how this could have happened and how we could avoid it again.",Null,1,3,5 March 2007
Knocked Up," It may turn out to be the best comedy of the summer.
","A girl being 'knocked up' in the past was as bad as a girl not having a cell phone today. The big A was not an acceptable remedy, and social rejection was pretty much routine.The new film Knocked Up shows how far we have come. The tension surrounding a non-condom night of drinking is less a social disaster than a question of how the two principals can mature enough to deserve the gift. Director Judd Apatow carries his talent from 40 Year Old Virgin into this light and endearing comedy.Both Seth Rogen (a buddy in Virgin) as Ben Stone and Katherine Heigl (The Ringer and Grey's Anatomy) as Alison Scot have perfect comic timing while the dialogue has an old screwball comedy pace, rapid and bright, affectionate and tough. Apatow nicely plays off the slacker Seth (Rogen may be better than Jon Heder's Napoleon) against Alison, a compulsive E! Entertainment reporter. When Stone first sees Alison naked, he blurts out, 'You're prettier than I am,' an obvious truth that brings sympathy for the underachieving, slightly pudgy protagonist. Jokes and insight are hard to put togetherApatow does it here.Whether or not these two victims of the demon alcohol will find love is for you to find out. However, you can be sure along the way to laugh at such naughty riffs as Seth's worry during lovemaking about his penis hitting the baby or the scenes where he and his stoner buddies concoct a for-profit website to show the specific occurrences of stars' nudity in films. You may not laugh at the graphic birth scenes, but you will be drawn closer to the lovers because of them.Although the film is long at 132 min., it may turn out to be the best comedy of the summer.",Null,64,128,30 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Burton does better than anyone else . . .
","'At last, my arm is complete again.' Sweeney Todd as he admires one of his efficient razors after a long absence.I'm not sure Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is 'grand,' but I'm confident it's in the best Grand Guignol tradition of sensational stage horror given its name from that little theater in early 20th century Paris that specialized in sensationally ghoulish productions. I am also sure that no one in film is better able to play the titular butcher than the shape-shifting, ever-naughty Johnny Depp.The opening song 'No Place Like London' hints to Anglophiles like me that it won't be my usual tour of West End theaters, rather a seedy, dangerous place where Mac the Knife would be more at home. Throughout the musical, Steven Sondheim's lyrics expressively revel in the amoral, throat-slicing world that Sweeney and his adoring meatpie lady, Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), wallow in as he prepares to take revenge on the equally amoral Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who dispatched Todd to prison early on to get his beautiful young wife. Hence Sweeney's revenge inclination.Sweeney's lyric best expresses the wildly murderous world, hardly the usual province of musicals: 'Alright! You, Sir?/No one's in the chair come on, come on/Sweeney's waiting/I want you bleeders./You sir! Too sir?/Welcome to the grave./I will have vengeance./I will have salvation . . . .' Yes, it's Sleepy-Hollow, Corpse-Bride Tim Burton's movie with blood spouting like red paint from a pressure gun contrasting the somber, almost black and white underside of London. When one of the children bites into a pie with a finger in it (shades of our contemporary law suits!), the audience doesn't even gasp, given the omnipresence of bloody bodies.There is no more interesting musical this year, even considering the enchanting Once. In the end, it is unsettling, unsavory, and unusual. Burton does better than anyone else in juxtaposing horror with innocence.",Null,151,238,14 December 2007
Blades of Glory," Sparse laughs but still enjoyable
","A bit of ballet, precision, and dignity accrue to figure skating, a small world where civility dances with ability. Enter Will Ferrell, the defoliator of formula racing and TV broadcasting (among other occupations), to skewer the rarefied competition of Olympic figure skating.Joining Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite slacker blasting, Ferrell's mock machismo makes him the Tom Jones and Heder the Owen Wilson of ice. Ferrell's Chazz Michael Michaels and Heder's Jimmy MacElroy are disqualified from competition because of their infantile public combat. They reconcile in time to enter competition as a team.As in most Ferrell outings, the laughs are sparse but satisfactory for a lightly satirical evening at the movies. Some outrageous bits such as flames shooting from Chazz's palms and a beheading during an extreme act evoke laughs if only for their audacity, not to mention the Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting where Chazz can barely contain his abstinence.A bit of gay bashing is requisite in comedies today, and two men skating begs for the satire, yet Blades of Glory does little of it in favor of its roasting pretentious figure skating. The innuendos for the brother and sister team, bitter and unethical rivals of the boys, provide tantalizing hints of incest as well. But mostly it's Ferrell's self inflating character that carries the film.The climactic competition, you guessed it: between the boys and the brother/sister team, concludes with an amusingly outrageous assault on JFK and Marilyn Monroe (albeit way too short to do justice to the possible outrages such a satire could yield), an affront to those who revere those icons, a delight to those who see pretense and revisionist history as fair game for SNL and Will Ferrell. Blades of Glory is not going to be the comedy of the year, but it will provide laughs anyway.",Null,2,4,1 April 2007
Horrible Bosses," A cooler for summer-workplace rage
","Horrible Bosses, a variation of the Hangover formula, is the kind of film I expected to bore me: boy-men on an outlandish quest with fundamentally rude jokes about parts of the body and its functions, bad guys with bad combovers, and outrageously horny women. They're all there, but somehow it's affectionately zany, partly because the actors work so well as an ensemble, partly because their dialogue is rapid and sometimes witty, and finally, because Jennifer Aniston, giving her second solid performance (Just go with It) in a year, plays against type.Three average guys, Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day), and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), hate their bosses so much they plot to kill them. Those arrangements, with the help of an alleged assassin adviser, Dean 'MF' Jones' (Jamie Foxx), lead to confusion and laughs that would befit the Marx, Smothers, and Jonas Brothers in collaboration.The hated bosses are the strength of the humor: Aniston's Dr. Julia Harris, is the wildest and most inventive, a nymphomaniac dentist determined to seduce Dale, her assistant, before he marries. Aniston goofs on her good girl image to craft an outrageously bad girl tough not to like, if only for her smashing good looks, revealing uniform, and surprisingly amusing delivery.Colin Farrell's Bobby Pellitt (the one with the combover) is a disgusting coke head who cares little for the little people of his company. (Kurt, womanizer that he is, nonetheless is far worthier to lead the company than Bobby.) Like other stars in this eclectic cast, Farrell takes a supporting role and easily steals his scenes.Kevin Spacey's Dave Harken may be even more despicable than Bobby. As owner of Nick's company promising Nick a promotion, Spacey is an ace at the acerbic and misanthropic: Here he's right at home while being an appropriate target for the constantly humiliated Nick.In the end, no serious sociological statements are made beyond the universal hatred of bosses. What's left is a comedy with some moments of outrageously low humor, quite fitting for the height of summer.",Null,1,5,6 July 2011
The Polar Express," Cold like the Arctic
","It's cold above the Arctic Circle, even if you work for a robust, often maligned caregiver. Director Robert Zamekis ('Cast Away) and Tom Hanks ('Cast Away') join forces again to make an animation based on the illustrated Chris Van Allsburg children's book about a seven-year old boy who questions Santa's existence and travels by magical train to Toyland for the ocular proof.Although the art process of 'performance capture,' which transforms human movements into animation (used also for Gollum in 'Lord of the Rings') is revolutionary in its magic realism, the characters are wondrously almost real, a fact that leads me to question why have animation at all if stylization is not a value for animation. However, the roller coaster like rides and unusual camera points of view (one time it actually looks through a printed page with the letters suspended) satisfy my need for the representational and fantastic in animation. The movie is cold like the Arctic: There is a blatantly conservative message that Boy Hero (he is not named, presumably for universal application reasons), and by implication everyone else on the train and in the world, should 'believe': believe the fussy and punctual conductor, the hobo, the boy's parents, and even the elves, when they encourage him to accept Santa (sounds evangelical, doesn't it?) contrary to what his eyes have shown him in real life and what his growing analytical mind has determined. With the appointment of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, the Girl The obedience motif of 'Express' reminds me of the rationale for the Iraq war and John Kerry's claim about a 'plan for the future.'Beyond the theme, the art/set design disturbs me as well. While the express is beautifully drawn and moved--when it slides on the ice you know why animation can be superior to old-fashioned photography-Santa's village is patterned after a 19th-century German factory town, which feels cold and vacant, no matter how loud the elves or how benign Santa. This revisionist interpretation appeals to my Christmas-agnostic side while it looks more opposite the spirit of the myth than the myth allows, even if following the spirit of the book. It would be like setting 'The Wizard of Oz' (which 'Polar Express' resembles) in Cleveland.What I like about the film is that Boy Hero seems a tad skeptical even after the adventure. I also like A.A.Milnes' jaundiced view: 'I find it difficult to believe in Father Christmas. If he is the jolly old gentleman he is always said to be, why doesn't he behave as such? How is it that the presents go so often to the wrong people?'There's a rumored half billion dollars needed before the company turn a profit, given Zamekis and Hanks reputedly taking a third. With the rather bleak tone of the film going contrary to the prevailing spirit of the season and the softening needs of a war-weary world, I suggest the filmmakers turn quickly to world distribution and DVD sales. Otherwise, it can be very cold even in the warm California sun.",Null,4,8,21 November 2004
Black Mass," Movie grim--Depp great.
","'It's not what you do, it's when and where you do it, and who you do it to or with. If nobody sees it, it didn't happen.' Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) Black Mass is as amoral as that quote and grim—a true-story as brutal as the murders committed on the screen. By 'brutal' I also mean the cinematography (as was the case with director Scott Cooper's 'Out of the Furnace'), which depicts a somber, dark South Boston, where danger comes from every opening a street might have.The story of notorious gangster Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) carries much of the darkness, if not all. Whitey's role as kingpin mobster and informant for the FBI requires deftness only actors like Depp can carry off. Yes, as the gangster formula usually has it, he evidences warmth and compassion at moments, but his operative emotion is anger.Similar to the gangster actors like Pacino and De Niro, Depp brings a quiet menace to the screen, whereby even the audience must respect the boss, Bulger. Depp is far better than he has been in years (no tics, no phony accents, etc.), underplaying a role Pacino might have chewn up along with the scenery. His humanistic interactions like caring for his son or an old lady are few but reveal a nuanced character not just a murderer.The film gives full characterization to FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) but skimps on others such as Whitey's state senator brother, Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). Seeing more of the two brothers would have been rich both for the acting and for depicting the unusual power held by two very different brothers. I was working in Southie in the mid-seventies, and the Bulger name was becoming legend. The different power held by each brother was arresting. This film tries to depict that anomaly with limited success.Among the film's few other weaknesses is the heavy-handed Junkie XL soundtrack, emphasizing each important moment with obvious meaning. Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott as agents are underused, though Scott's role is almost laughably a victim of editing. However, my comment underscores how rich the film is in acting and the right actors to play the parts.'Take your shot but make it your best. Cause I get up, I eat ya.'

The Town," It's a good visit.
","In director/star Ben Affleck's The Town, there are too many rounds of assault rifles and too much mumbling among the hardened criminals of Charlestown, Mass., where he grew up. But then there's much to like—the occasional joke and the infrequent but authentic romantic moments as well as realistic ones between old friends who are deeply involved in heists.Doug (Affleck) and Jem (Jeremy Renner), best friends from youth, head a small gang of bank robbers, who are methodical but suffer from conventional weaknesses such as hot heads and women, in this case the bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall), whom they must abduct and Affleck must eventually love. Jem is the out-of-control sidekick to the more sensitive Doug (about his dad crying at his mother's departure, Doug says, 'I'd never heard a man cry before'). Both hoodlums are a modern day Butch and Sundance with swagger and recklessness but missing the sense of purpose those two cowboy heroes had. Bonnie and Clyde are closer.Surprisingly for a heist film, the romance is natural, as mixed up as it should be with Doug stalking Claire while loving her. He pleads, 'Ask me anything you want.' 'I won't believe you,' she says. It's tough in Charlestown. No formulaic ending for them either, although the twist has been done before as well.Charlestown is lovingly photographed, accents are thick, and most everyone is stuck in this notorious crime town (although I worked in Dorchester, I never dared to go to Charlestown). Heists in film have become formulaic—Affleck puts some new humanity in that mix. The Town is his second serious directorial outing (Gone Baby Gone is his first), and it's much better in almost every way.Given that he does so well in front of the camera, too, I predict he'll be entertainment busy for decades to come.",Null,0,7,16 September 2010
Suicide Squad," It's summer, it's fun, but it's not a memorable movie.
","'What is this? Cheerleading tryouts?' DeadshotSuicide Squad is the most recent entry in the summer mayhem action movies, and it's distinctive only in its conceit: Assemble the baddest asses in the world from Louisiana's Belle Rive prison to eradicate even badder ones from somewhere else in the universe. Kind of like making a conscience-deficient dictator next president of the USA. Led by Deadshot (Will Smith), six dead souls, including the randy and dangerous Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), are recruited from lockup by the questionably-ethical government agent, Amanda Walker (Viola Davis). Their mission: Execute a black ops mission and receive clemency. Most sane operatives would not touch this group, much less give them license to kill, but these are desperate times because bad must beat bad as good has gone AWOL.What ensues is full of explosions and innumerable rounds of bullets, and oh, yes, a nice touch of a very sharp sword. If you can wade through the cacophony and carnage, there are a few lines like the one at the head of this essay worth noting and another: 'It's taken me some time, but I finally have them. The worst of the worst.' (Amanda Walker)I know what you're saying to yourself, can this be the best of the best lines, and I say it's difficult to find better. So focused is director David Ayer on the gymnastics of violence that he forgets crisp dialogue, or at least sardonic talk, such as in Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool, is more lethal than all the munitions you can muster.To show how off-center director and writers are, most of the first hour of the film is dedicated to the presenting the vitae of the six bad heroes. Then, when they finally meet each other, it seems we almost go through the bios we had in the first part of the film.Mostly it makes the dark Batman v Superman look like a birthday party. Even the love affair between Harley and The Joker (Jared Leto) is more like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, so full of over-the-top posing it is. Suicide Squad's squandering will make you remember the forgettable Fantastic Four. Yep, that boring.",Null,5,14,4 August 2016
Shutter Island," Not one of his greats.
","Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island reminds me of Hitchcock's successful Vertigo, Psycho, and most of all, Spellbound, without the success. The mentally unstable characters who provided Hitchcock hints of utter depravity in those classics in Shutter Island mainly serve facile plot twists.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal who, with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) goes to Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in 1954 to investigate the escape of a notorious murderess of her own three children. Almost everyone at that Boston harbor institution besides the patients seems a bit off center, even Teddy, who brings some psychological baggage to the job.While the cinematography is appropriately claustrophobic and the 19th century industrial brick insane asylum and its accompanying Civil War fort reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs with a touch of Alcatraz, the plot twists are indiscriminately telegraphed while Teddy's recurring visions of his deceased wife are too many and annoying. As the resident shrink, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is much smoother than Lambs' Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald) but not half as fun. Nor is there a villain who can come close to Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. Although Teddy is the center of the film, Scorsese spends too many frames on tortured close-ups, as if he were making sure that DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar next year. The film should have expanded the role of Dr. Naehring, head of the hospital, because the estimable Max von Sydow could have saved the film from boredom as the twists are telegraphed obviously and way too bluntly. In its favor, Scorsese plays deftly, if not a bit too obviously, with different camera angles such as bird's eye and visual images such as bright red blood, reminiscent of the stunning work in Sam Mendes' American Beauty.When you've directed Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull, you have a tough time topping yourself. Shutter Island is not a film to be ashamed of; it's just not as good as his greats.",Null,18,43,17 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A fine work of comic-book nostalgia and real-world sensibility.
","Natasha Romanoff: 'You do anything fun Saturday night?' Steve Rogers: 'Well, all the guys in my barbershop quartet are dead. So no, not really.'Although in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I wanted Natasha (Scarlet Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans, aka Captain America) to become romantic, the film's ability to rise above cliché is paramount. These warriors fight evil without the usual encumbrances of sci-fi thriller formulas. The film is a fine work of comic-book nostalgia and real-world sensibility. And it happens to be over two hours of fun as evidenced by the humor in the above quote.When Captain America has to contend with a baddie played by the perpetual goodie, Robert Redford, you know this adventure is going to be a unique one. Alexander Pierce (Redford) plans to make the world a better place by eliminating 20 million rebels through an algorithm long ago created when Steve Rogers was a normal soldier. From there, you have to see the film to catch the sometimes creative but always entertaining screenplay.This thriller pleases me because it is complex enough to keep me trying to fit all the puzzle pieces but humane enough to keep me engaged with the characters, whom I understand better than most in similar sci-fi outings.Yes, it's a smart film with warmth and humor, a pleasant viewing experience at a poor time of year for seeing good movies. You know Captain America saves America, but that's not the point: If you're thrilled by special-effects action, including some real vehicles, and want to care about the characters and dislike the bad guys, then you're in for a sweet experience, saved, so to speak, from a dead-zone movie time of the year.'Captain, in Order to build a better world, sometimes means turning the old one down...

Capote," With most miraculous organ.
","'For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ.' Hamlet Yes, Hoffman is Oscar-worthy in Capote. No, you never learn how the acclaimed author of Breakfast at Tiffany's actually wrote, but you do see how he researches. The latter is aided by a 94% retentive memory, freeing him up to look at his subject with piercing eyes.The subject of this film is as much the murderers of rural Kansas's four Clutter family members as it is about Capote. Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pelligrino) were the subject of Capote's In Cold Blood, an innovative approach to historical depiction by way of fiction (non-fiction novel) that allows the author to intrude and create narrative pieces at will (Our 'docudramas' are the descendants).Hoffman's imitation of Capote's eccentric mannerisms and high voice is close to perfect, in the tradition of a flamboyant Southerner, but more is the sense that Hoffman understands and 'inhabits' his character, a very modern method acting achievement. His relationship with Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), about to become famous for her To Kill a Mockingbird, is touching, especially since she appears to be someone who tells him off when necessary. Capote's interaction with his longtime lover, novelist Jack Dunphy, is treated with quiet grace. Smith occupies most of Capote's time and interest, some suggesting the gay author had fallen in love with him.As if the complexities of Capote's relationships were not enough, director Miller and writer Futterman ever so gently weave in the possibility that Capote did not do enough to stay the executions because he needed to finish his novel, a feat he couldn't do without their deaths: 'All I want to do is write the ending, and there's no end in sight,' Capote's wrenching the story from Smith is the ongoing struggle that reveals the writer's manipulative and mendacious nature.At the very least, Capote struggled with the business of his writing and his growing affection for Smith, strongly identifying with his abandonment as a child: 'It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. One day, I went out the front door and he went out the back.'",Null,1,3,1 November 2005
Life of Pi," The most imaginative film this year
","''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat.' From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundlings. Pi's relationship with tiger 'Richard Parker' represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.'Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing,' says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat.",Null,355,436,21 November 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's hits a lucky thirteen.
","'The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief.' Shakespeare's Othello Andy Garcia's wealthy Terry Benedict is financing Danny Ocean's Vegas heist from casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino) in order to get the last smile of vengeance, thief to thief, while Danny and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) exact their own revenge. No honor among these slick reprobates, and good time is had by all the men and, this time, not Julia Roberts, but Clooney's real-life squeeze, Ellen Barkin, as Abigail Sponder, tough right hand to Bank.I go to most movies as a film critic with my sensibility well-guarded against the fluffy confection of just another heist. But the Ocean's franchise, like the Bond's, has a cachet all its own with eye-pleasing duds, high-tech high jinx, and self-referential dialogue. Thus I am free to enjoy without feeling as if I'd sold out to crass commercialismI have, but willfully and pleasurably.I guess I'm sucked in like everyone else at the movies, even with as many as I've seen and written about, because I want to go where the director, in this case the estimable Steven Soderbergh, wants to take me. In Ocean's 12, it was all over Europe; in Thirteen it's the entertainment Mecca of the Western world.No deep thoughts come to mind, just summer mindlessness dressed up for partying (Pitt and Clooney very nicely decked out, understatedly). Clooney's musings about the changes in Vegas since guys like him had shaken Sinatra's hand serves as 'change' leitmotif lighter than air. Twenty years from now we'll be talking about the iconic Pitt and Clooney in the same nostalgic way. Ocean's Thirteen reinforces its place in popular culture as a repository for our transitory adulation of movie stars and the escapes they gave us long ago.At the end, Matt Damon exits with 'See you when I see you,' a fitting piece of noncommittal that may promise another Ocean's installment or just more star sightings. Clooney says goodbye to Pitt with an in-joke the world is in on: 'Hey! Next time! Keep the weight off. Pitt retorts, 'Have a couple of kids.' This is typical of the low-key, sweetly narcissistic third installment.Ocean's hits a lucky thirteen this time around without a big jackpot but a great deal of good will.",Null,39,75,5 June 2007
Lost in Translation," This film translates into one of the best movies the year.
","Having asexually but lovingly interacted with a few women younger than I, I have finally found a film to legitimize those unions.  Sofia Coppola's `Lost in Translation' connects my joy to the superior performance of Bill Murray as a married, middle-aged movie star making a whiskey commercial in Tokyo. His connection with Scarlett Johansson as a brainy recent college grad in a losing marriage to a successful photographer is platonic with an undercurrent of non-fatal attraction.I was enthralled by Christine Lahti's `My First Mister' with Albert Brooks and Leelee Sobieski as a middle-aged haberdasher and a 17-year old Goth girl, which caves to the Hollywood need for sex. `Translation' goes much further in building friendship over sex, to the sweet extent that I forgot the age difference between my loves and me and longed to keep all of them as young as I in heart forever.Whether or not Murray and Johansson sleep together is so beside the point when considering the sweetness and light they give each other as they try to translate their struggling marriages into understanding. Coppola takes us through a Times Square/ Piccadilly Circus neon background that makes me long to visit Tokyo, a heretofore missing desire for this frequently-traveling critic.At one point, a TV monitor shows Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg in the famous Trevi fountain of `LA Dolce Vita.'  The depth of characterization and the superior acting (Murray deserves an Oscar nomination) outstrip Fellini's grand moment between the generations.  When Murray croons Roxy Music's 'More Than This,' it's every bit as amusing as his best work in SNL and as poignant a turn as he has ever had in his best movies.But the theme is the same in all these May/September affairs: love transforms; the age differences are merely minor players in a much more spectacular evolution of spirits released from the bondages of convention.
Sophia Coppola has her father's gift to objectify the heart in the landscape and adds her original talent for finding graceful moments in silence. That translates into one of the best movies this year.",Null,0,0,18 September 2003
Tangled," Patented Disney
","Flynn Rider: 'You smell that? It's part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell, but overall it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?' Tangled is not the Rapunzel story your mom grew up on. As the above quote attests, Disney has post-modernized it with updated, semi-hip dialogue and some Freudian notions that fit the story's thematic base. Disney has made a fun movie of an old fairy-tale chestnut, not as complex as Princess and the Frog, but good enough to be the studio's 50th animation and going strong.How does 26 years old Mandy Moore's voice sound like 18-year old's? It does, and I'm impressed with the whole angle of vision that emphasizes the needs of pre-teens and teens to bolt from the nest and see the world as it is, not through parents' eyes, while promoting the value of family, real family that is.Supposedly the visual style, an effective use of 3D, has the properties of 'The Swing,' a romantic painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard. Whatever, the hair of the two leads, and even wicked 'mom,' is textured and layered in a most realistic,yet romantically stylized fashion.Disney is canny enough to use Rapunzel's hair as a weapon, similar to Indiana Jones's whip, to take the staid glam out of its tradition and make it useful for more than a ladder. Even the sidekick chameleon, to be almost as welcomed as Donkey in Shreck, has reactions reflecting the modern cynicism rather than the cute simpleton.In its further favor, the love between the two teens is not in the Twilight longing motif—it rather it grows organically from a mutual respect, not lust divorced from the idealized bodies Disney distractingly offers in its animations. In short, your thinking youngsters should love the ironies Tangled offers while it entertains with patented Disney humanity.",Null,2,5,24 November 2010
Interstellar," Visual and thematic feast with too heavy daddy issues.
","'This world's a treasure, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.' Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) Knowing that famed physicist Kip Thorne worked closely with famed brainy director Christopher Nolan, I was prepared for what I got: a scientifically full plate of theories that sound right for worm holes and time warp and a dramatically-charged space opera with enough head-scratching psychology to please the most discerning geeks.As for the rest of us, it's damn good sci-fi peopled with top actors and enough time to flesh out the characters and explain the science. The angst that haunts pilot Cooper, a former ace NASA pilot, is leaving his daughter, Murph (Mackenzie Foy), to travel to a new galaxy on the other side of a worm hole. But it has too much of this emotional torture. Enough father-daughter, please.The set up with Coop farming and enjoying his daughter in an increasingly new Dust Bowl world is a long 40 minutes before he blasts off. Once in space, the action picks up with a science officer, Brand (Anne Hathaway). and a robot TARS, lacking the smoothness of 2001's Hal but smarter with a surprisingly agile body, given it looks like the monolith from that classic film. Finally for my complaints, it is annoying to endure many of the women in the film having emotional/anger problems that get in the way of the science and developing some of the other minor characters.Yet the visual effects by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (Her) and a superb VE team with jaw-dropping galactic imagery never get in the way of the science. Only now and then does Hans Zimmer's bombastic organ music detract from the plot. These are small carps about an otherwise impressive achievement in storytelling.Surprising a film so heavily laden with gravity, relativity, and the bending of time can engage the audience for so long with mostly human, earthbound shenanigans such as long-lost loves, bad guys, and declining fuel supply, to mention just a few. Science and math are the keys to survival, a point not lost on anyone in the audience.Director Christopher Nolan is no freshman devising intricate stories to challenge even the science nerds, who should be happy with the theories as the rest of us are with the humanity.",Null,4,11,5 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," May be the best movie of 2017
","If you long for the brilliant depiction of the melancholy unity between humor and pathos, you'll love writer/director Martin McDonagh's darkly comic Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. In seeming homage to the Coen Brothers, especially their iconic Fargo and Raising Arizona, this film takes the rape/murder of Mildred Hayes's (Frances McDormand) daughter and weaves the dreary investigation with some scarily funny takes on small-town rednecks/crackers.Mildred spurs the investigation of her daughter's murder by placing three billboards that accuse the local police, especially Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), of slacking. However, this is just the MacGuffin that pales in the shadow of the town's bigotry and lassitude. The Chief, however, is not necessarily culpable as he claims to have tried but without physical proof such as DNA.Mildred, in Marge Gunderson mode, pursues the killer at the expense of local sympathy: 'It seems to me the police department is too busy torturing black folk to solve actual crimes.' Note the slams at languorous cops and racism, motifs played throughout.Catching the right dark tones between grief and hilarious ineptitude, this film knows justice is not easy and sometimes meted out by imbeciles. Yet, getting on with a goal and learning cooperation and compromise, especially in a small town, may lead to a comfort that goes beyond catching a murderer.The acting is incomparable. When Harrelson talks about the culture of racism, there's truth in his voice, sadness in his tone: 'If you got rid of all the cops with vaguely racist leanings, you'd have only have three cops left. And all of them would hate fags.'",Null,6,15,22 November 2017

","'No one's ever really gone.' Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)Nor is the Star Wars franchise, which, in Star Wars: Episode IX--The Rise of Skywalker seems to go on like the universe, forever. J.J. Abrams has directed the alleged end of the main stories, which started over 40 years ago. My kids are grown but not forgetting their first experience in the '70's, which the recent 'rise' replicates in spirit if not in richness of characters.The old heroes are still here, with Oscar Isaac's Poe the obvious heir to Harrison Ford's Han Solo, for instance. Even Princess Leia is here even if in archival-edited form (Carrie Fisher is dead). Han Solo in the form of the real Harrison Ford makes a cameo appearance as he faces off once again his son, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). These are all memorable characters as is the swashbuckling Jedi hope, Rey (Daisy Ridley).The new characters like an abused droid and Poe's masked and brief love interest leave no legacy. In fact, too many characters people this space, like commuters on a NYC subway line. And that goes for the number of incidents, which bring plenty of action but rarely thematic significance.What is significant is the recurring theme that through cooperation, friendship, love we can win against the dark forces. The contemporary relevance is just as fresh as it was generations ago. If you band together, for instance in the ballot box, you might gain happiness, peace, and bring down a wicked old Sith emperor. The applications for good people banding together are many in the real world as well as fiction and science fiction.Star Wars: Episode IX--The Rise of Skywalker is an enjoyable holiday adventure rich with episodes and, for many of us, nostalgia.

American Sniper," It's rough out there, even in real life.
","'That was evil like I've never seen before.' Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) Besides The Hurt Locker, I can't think of another film that better expresses the frustrations and horrors of the war in Iraq than Clint Eastwood's American Sniper. Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is called 'Legend' by his fellow troops for his sniper expertise, 160 confirmed kills to be precise.Based on Kyle's writings, the film is executed in a stark, realistic fashion that Kathryn Bigelow would approve. The colors are bled out, like the camouflage desert uniforms; the dust swirls at times like the fog of war, and true to the genre, the middle-class home life is less than glamorous with a wife clamoring for her husband's return. Taya (Sienna Miller) was seduced by Chris after meeting him in a bar (even though she avowed no interest in the 'self-centered pricks'), a metaphor for her seduction into thinking she could marry a SEAL and have a normal family life.The abnormal life is couched in four tours for him, each one progressively distancing him from his family. He feels the obligation to protect them and his buddies from evil. Having not accepted the fiction of WMD's, where some other soldiers have, he doggedly pursues the enemy the best way he knows how, as a sniper, and a very good one at that.The battle scenes in Fallujah are even more horrific than those in Fury because the enemy is not in tanks but hiding in civilian clothes. It is virtually impossible sometimes to tell the good guys from the bad. For example in an early sequence, Chris is faced with the ultimate sniper horror: a mother and child walk suspiciously toward a group of soldiers, and he must decide if they are hostile or not. Even our cool-hearted protagonist has to pause in situations like this.Eastwood has again shown that a director need not be young to be relevant and powerful. American Sniper will make you happy we have just about left the Iraq theater, but it will not make you feel safe for the rest of our engagements in the mid-east.",Null,4,19,15 January 2015
Corpse Bride," Visual Poe
","Although a few of us have married corpse-like spouses, and those unions were doomed to hell from the start, Tim Burton in Corpse Bride depicts Victor (voice of Johnny Depp), a shy, awkward, introverted pianist actually marrying a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter), by error. Because this is stop-motion animation, even better visually than Burton's Nightmare before Christmas (1993), the expressions are artful and sweet, macabre and eccentric, all the while depicting with icy hilarity the pitfalls of arranged marriages and passive attitudes. Along with the recent Just Like Heaven, Corpse Bride's dependence on love in its Platonic, non-corporeal form is entering the imaginations of contemporary writers in more than one film.If you like your Edgar Allen Poe visual, this animation is for you. The characters from hell, such as Mr. Bonejangles, a Peter Lorre maggot knockoff, and a headwaiter with just a head, are Halloween scary and funny while the more normal living beings, such as Victor's social-climbing parents and fiancé Victoria's poor aristocrat parents, are already in their own pre-grave version of hell.How Victor inadvertently weds a skeleton (albeit a curvey one) and gets dragged to hell is yours to find out. Meanwhile, sit back and enjoy the brilliance of a director whose imagination is scary.From Shakespeare's 'Measure for Measure':'. . .

Lion," Dev Patel is swell.
","'You can't go home again.' Thomas WolfeIf that's true, then Lion as a film is pure daydreaming, for Saroo (Dev Patel) as a 25 year old man in Australia has spent 20 years away from his home in India and wants to return. Not as easy as it sounds: After leaving home at 5 unwittingly on a train for days, he is eventually adopted to Australia with loving foster parents and the need to find his real mother and family.As far as daydreaming, Lion is based on a true story, so take that you naysayers. For those in love with technology, see Google Maps work its magic.This lyrically-played, beautifully shot, at times depressing melodrama is a study in love: Saroo's love shared with his adoptive mother, Sue (Nicole Kidman), is affecting, so authentic is Kidman's performance. I've never seen her act as finely as this. Too bad she is underused here. Her joy in the little boy and her deep connection to the adult is one of filmdom's finest relationships. An Oscar nod is sure to come.However, so distraught is Saroo's adult life with his dreams of youth and finding home that he leaves his hospitality job, almost destroys his love with a classmate (Rooney Mara), and distances himself from his adoptive family. Nobody ever said searching for your mother would be easy, and this film makes sure you know that. Its metaphors about two worlds reaching for each other give dramatic and interpretive heft.In an effective juxtaposition, the addled, ruinous adopted brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), contrasts the mature and overly-sensitive Saroo. His anger against Mantosh saps the film of its established melancholic pace, almost as if we needed to be jolted out of sharing the obsessive homecoming dream.Saroo must eventually decide which identity to take—Aussie or Indian.

Gone Baby Gone," Gravitas without Gigli
","Something about Dorchester, Ma., makes directors such as Gus van Sant (GoodWill Hunting), Clint Eastwood (Mystic River), Martin Scorsese (Departed), and now neophyte Ben Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) go for its working-class realism that celebrates the abrasive friendships of hard-knocks' sharing and the comfort of life-long neighborhoods. In Gone, Affleck's script recalls the lost child motif of Mystic and the betrayals of Departed, with less of the latter's intensely-felt terror and more of the former's existential angst.Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are hired to find a missing little girl, but as any aficionado of the thriller knows, there's much more to the plot than this. While the first hour plods through the increasingly boring CSI rituals of gathering evidence, the last 45 min. are reflections about the demands a conscience makes on contemporary relativistic challenges that could be settled at either end of the ethical spectrum.If you allow me the almost irrelevant example, the Iraq war could be thought of as the greatest humanitarian effort in the world's history or the greatest foreign relations blunder in American history, depending on how you view things. Affleck's film engages this kind of Platonic give and take between the ideal and the real with a denouement that leans toward the ideal without fully making its case.In other words, I liked the dialogue between police captain Morgan Freeman and private detective Affleck about the fate of the lost child, a sparring that raises the film from mediocre whodunit into a dissertation about the ethical maxim that the ends do not justify the means. Along the way, Dorchester is evoked with more realism than in Mystic River, largely through montages and cutaways of real denizens and a few local actors.But the film's adherence to clichÃ©d cop techniques such as interminable interviews with locals to build a case keeps this from being a groundbreaking effort by the new helmer. But, hey, even Eastwood used these techniques. Yet, Eastwood has gravitas and no Gigli.",Null,31,140,27 September 2007
"Monsters, Inc."," `Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.
","You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in `Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great `Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic.  I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in `Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets.  It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today's letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel `Animal Farm' for political and sociological levels of meaning.  For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature `For the Birds' -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock's memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.The short trailer for `Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.`Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.",Null,81,97,25 October 2001
The Lost City of Z," Swashbuckling adventure at home and abroad!
","'To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.' Tennyson's UlyssesPercy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnan) in the first part of the 20th century was the fulfillment of 3 out of 4 exhortations by Ulysses. His real life journeys searching for an Amazonian lost city ended famously without our knowing his and his son Jack's fate somewhere in that jungle.Writer director James Gray in the lushly-photographed Lost City of Z has caught the measured spirit of David Grann's book about the search in a fashion that does not cater to our romanticized notion of exploration as Tennyson did. In an unusual tack, he shows not a terrifying, maggot-filled hike but rather one filled with hope to find this version of Eldorado while he is hounded by thoughts of the dear family left behind for years.In fact, while you might long to see another version of Herzog's Aguirre: The Wrath of God, with a crazed conquistador floating on a raft of wild monkeys and daughter bride, here you have not a crazed adventurer but rather a level-headed British major, confident that his discovery will bring tolerance and equality for the 'Indians' and restore the honor of his family name crippled by his drunken father.Yet I'm being more certain than Gunn and Gray; never do we fully know Fawcett is crazed or obsessive. We are uncertain about his fundamental motivation. Maybe we shouldn't know, for he is a good man who has a job to do, initially surveying a river to its source, and after finding artifacts pursuing exploration as an extension of that duty. He's common like so many dreamers, so we can identify with him.The Lost City of Z is an enjoyable, uplifting, non violent exploration of not so much the jungle as the decent human spirit looking for a purpose in life that just happens to be the unknown:'But he grew old— This knight so bold— And o'er his heart a shadow— Fell as he found No spot of ground That looked like Eldorado.'

Ant-Man," It'a a minimalist Marvel.
","'Scott, I've been watching you for a while, now. You're different. Now, don't let anyone tell you that you have nothing to offer.' Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas)The little Ant-Man movie has much to offer: a likable, understated Marvel hero, a believable story of families in transition, and fewer explosions than any other blockbuster this summer or any time for that matter. In other words, it's my fav Marvel, a shrink-wrapped Iron Man with more humor than Tony Stark has altogether in his Avengers canon. Think a minimalist Guardians of the Galaxy to get an idea of the fun.Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang/Ant-Man, an ex-con with a big heart, who wants to win visitation rights with his young daughter. Rudd has the sweetness, comic timing, and athletic composure to be a pint-sized hero with a smile: 'No, I'm the Ant-Man! I know, it wasn't my idea.' Join him with classy-actor Michael Douglas as the scientist, Dr. Hank Pym, who started it all by creating the suit that could shrink Scott to bug size but with very big power (in the comics, Pym also created Ultron). Pym says, with characteristic seriousness and only a hint of sarcasm: 'This is not some cute tech like the Iron Man suit!'It's not Hulk's size or Thor's hammer giving Ant-Man the otherworldly strength—it's the suit and the armies of insects he commands that can infiltrate even the most secure system. Rudd's low-key charm makes him standout from most Avengers for his diffidence and sense of irony. Tony Stark has the sense of humor but lacks Scott's everyman subtlety. Because Ant-Man is essentially about family bonds (even Pym needs his daughter's affection and allegiance), it has a more congenial and humane feel than other spectacles in the Marvel universe.Notice how CGI can take 30 years off Michael Douglas and also make us believe we are in Lilliput where our hero, Ant-Man, rides 'Anthony,' a sizable flying insect.

21 Jump Street," The boys aren't bad.
","'You are here because you some Justin Beaver, Miley Cirus lookin' muthas.' Captain Dickson (Ice Cube)It would be easy to discount 21 Jump Street as just a reworking of The Other Guys in which mismatched, underachieving neophyte cops fight the bad guys. But I can't do it because Schmidt (Jonah Hill), the smart but homely one, and Jenko (Channing Tatum), the cute but dumb one, are credible comedians and bromantic partners. It may not be much like the original TV show of the '80's, but it has an easy-going charm sparked by the two leads.They're posing as high schoolers trying to bust a drug operation. While the set ups are stock, with the undercover cops avoiding detection by trying to be cool to join the dealers, the interaction between Schmidt and Jenko is effortlessly endearing . They may get mad at each other, but you know they would take a bullet for the other. Hill underplays his usual nerdy persona, perhaps in sync with his slimmer physique, and Channing shows some subtle comic timing absent in almost all his previous films, most notably for me in The Eagle.I must complain about the bloody ending, almost totally out of rhythm with the rest of the zany antics. Although such mayhem may be the result of drug dealing in any situation, here it seem unnecessary and shocking, making an uneasy segue to a celebration.Yet that criticism does highlight the rest of the film's success in making a real action, bromantic comedy with likable leads. I welcome this relief from the uneven Project X, whose teen party is surreal next to the more realistic one in this film.I write 'realistic' with irony on my mind because none of these proceedings is realistic; otherwise if it were like real life, it sure wouldn't be funny.",Null,0,6,18 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," It's All American.
","'General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but are won by men. Our goal is to create the greatest army in history. But every army begins with one man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldier. We are going to win this war because we have the best men. And they, personally, will escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of Hell.' Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) In Captain America: The First Avenger, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has been determined unfit for service in WWII, so he volunteers for a secret project that changes him into America's ace defender, Captain America, and the first of the Avengers, who have adorned our summers with satisfying action forever it seems.What makes this such an agreeable adventure sci fi is director Joe Johnston's ability to underplay the graphics in favor of the characterizations. While some of the artillery is molecular obliterating, mostly it's pumped up WWII munitions with the real pumping coming in the terrific war boosting scenes with song and dance, just the way the US sold war bonds to finance the real war.With Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Chester Phillips and Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, the adventure is old-fashioned comic-book good and one of the highlights of the summer. Nobody plays the hard-nose with a heart better than Jones, and Weaving's nefarious Nazi makes you almost, but not really, forget Christoph Waltz's Oscar winning Col. Hans Landa.I have always judged these movies in part on the central romance, that formulaic hookup between the hero and some form of a fawning female. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) loves scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a silly connection with a silly Portman goo-goo eyed over the godly visitor. On the other hand, Captain America's connection with army officer Peggy Carter movies gently in a dance that has the usual rough beginning but ending nicely with love and admiration.Captain America: The First Avenger belongs to all the cast, who delivered just the right beats to the overall music of playful, escapist summer.",Null,5,27,21 July 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne Again
","'That the spy will fabricate his information is a mere commonplace. But in the sphere of political and revolutionary action, relying partly on violence, the professional spy has every facility to fabricate the very facts themselves, and will spread the double evil of emulation in one direction, and of panic, hasty legislation, unreflecting hate, on the other. However, this is an imperfect world . . . .'Joseph Conrad, The Secret AgentHere's my ultimatum: Find a better spy thriller this year or agree with me (not a natural instinct for discerning readers) that Bourne Ultimatum is one cracker-jack adventure, not exceeded by even the estimable Live Free or Die Hard. Paul Greengrass solidifies his rep as a director who can helm intelligent action and keep the audience enthralled for hours.Jason Bourne for three years has been tracking himself because amnesia was a part of his training as a super sleuth for the CIA and he wants to know who the hell he is. On his path to self knowledge lie countless bodies, dispatched with an admirable efficiency, albeit fantastic at times. But the genius of this film is to make me a believer in that supremacy, so good is Damon at projecting smarts and physical superiority.Part of the fun is tracking the world with him from Turin to Tangiers to Waterloo Station, a favorite spot of mine where the Thames and the Eye converge on the passages of every traveler in London. Bourne navigates despite the CIA's best attempts to stop him; he guides a reporter through the station with cell phones, a tour de force sequence of technology aiding intelligence. It's athletic, scary, and exhilarating, as if Bourne were guiding us through the labyrinth of the very movie itself.Bourne Ultimatum touches lightly on the current challenges of government-sanctioned rendition and torture. When Damon asks an antagonist/operative to look at what they have become, assassins who don't know why they assassinate, and when assistant director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) discloses that his unit may murder at will, Congress's subpoenas can be seen waiting for Cheney and his covert crew. The film manages to strike a pose even while neocons and struggling Dems enjoy the ride.You can bet the resolution is another compressed denouement with a heavy dose of the incredible. So be it.

Rush," One of the best racing movies ever.
","'The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.' James HuntAlthough in the mid 1970's, I was about to begin a satisfying and successful phase of my academic career, I had never heard of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, two world champions of formula one racing. Ron Howard's action biography of the racers and their milieu changes my ignorance in two invigorating hours called, appropriately, Rush, starring respectively Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl.Rush is one of the best racing movies of all time and rewards my cinematic demands as few biographies have ever done. Beyond the thrilling cinematography that couples the passions of the players with the sound of the engines and colors of the racing cars, director Howard and writer Peter Morgan give their two principals witty lines and restrained emotional confrontations, much as we would expect in real life with small poetic flourishes: 'The wind you can feel is me breathing down your neck. Next time, I'll have you.' Hunt to Lauda; 'Happiness is the enemy.' Lauda to his wife.A leitmotif about the value of having enemies ('Trust me: watching you win those races, while I was fighting for my life, you were equally responsible for getting me back in the car.' Lauda to Hunt) is expertly woven into the visceral racing story. That theme binds the characters into an unsentimental Apollonian-Dionysian competition that is more graceful than bitter. Even the inevitable clashes with lovers and wives who suffer the life-threatening races are not in the least obtrusive or annoying. In other words, Howard doesn't weigh his film down with clichés, and he doesn't waste time with love interests or the usual significant-other obsessions about the dangers. What Howard does do is to give us a sense of the excitement and danger of arguably the world's most dangerous sport. And then he peppers that action with biography that makes sense but doesn't overshadow the main action.Rush feel like a summer blockbuster that was rerouted to the fall because it turned out to be more than spectacle. Some of the excitement of the drivers is reserved for the audience:'The risk of death turns people on.' James Hunt.",Null,4,6,2 October 2013
Nightcrawler," One of the best thrillers of the year and one of the best performances.
","'If it bleeds, it leads.' TV news adage There's plenty of blood to be filmed and sold to a TV station by enterprising photographers in Nightcrawlers. If they can get to the scene of the crime or accident earlier than other photojournalists, aka 'nightcrawlers,' so much the better. Driven Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) learns how to get there early and how to sell the footage to a station.Nightcrawlers is an expert thriller about footage jockeys and the ethics of manipulating news. Lou bloom is inordinately ambitious, with prestige and money driving him further and further down the amoral rabbit hole. When he arrives early at a scene and moves the bloody body for better light, it's clear he's on his way to more and better crime as he ingratiates himself with TV news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) and becomes a part of her station's leading bloody news stories.What little I have experienced on the TV news set of a local station is accurately depicted: the fast pace, quick decisions (what to leave out, what to leave in), and the integrity of the news itself. No question Lou's footage is what the station needs to rise in the ratings, no question Nina needs to decide if she can pay his price, no question the ethical boundaries are uncertain. In all cases, the OCD Lou has figured the angles enough ahead of time to win the contract and evade the law. He already has answered his partner, Rick's (Riz Ahmed), question, 'Why aren't we at the rape in Vincent Park like everyone else?' (See the opening quote). Probably not enough blood.The issue of ratings' influence hangs about this movie with decisions about buying and showing controversial footage always present at sweep times. Add the legal ramifications and it's quite a moral-ethical stew.When Lou says, 'I have to go home and do some accounting,' he is rejecting an offer from a rival firm and confirming numbers and no people are his world. Although he can be a charmer, his vacant, unblinking stare and humorless speeches on business practices, learned from the Internet, are an early sign that he can be affectless and dangerous.Gyllenhaal gives the performance of a lifetime, and Nightcrawler is one of the year's best thrillers.",Null,9,17,31 October 2014
Oblivion," Cruise is still eminently watchable even if his film isn't.
","'I can't shake the feeling, that earth, inspite of all that's happened, earth is still my home.' Jack Harper Ordinarily, I am loathe to like romance in science fiction as it seems pedestrian when set off against the shenanigans of man in the universe. The exception is Oblivion, a comfortable, clichéd sci-fi set in 2077, starring a nimble and valorous Tom Cruise as a somewhat poetic veteran pilot Jack, whose two beautiful women make reasonable demands of him; he handles the complications with finesse and a sense of the importance of love.He's a mop-up operative, fixing drones on a vacated earth that has been attacked by aliens, who have retreated but left the victors with an inhospitable, post-apocalyptic mess and some unsavory survivors. Almost everyone has gone to one of Jupiter's moons, to which Jack is not anxious to go because of his love of Earth (see quote above).Jack's a charming Han Solo in a plane that looks like a child's fantasy helicopter. His girl, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), communicates with him as he does his daily rounds. However, meeting Morgan Freeman, in his usual sage persona (as rebel leader Malcolm Beech), changes Jack forever. Beech has a bit of Obi Wan in him, enough to make Jack rethink why he's doing this work, and for whom. Meeting a woman from his past, Julia (Catherine-Zeta Jones lookalike, Olga Kuryenko), threatens his now-erased memory to return. Eventually the plot devolves into taking care of business with a kind of Death Star hovering over earth and attempting to rejuvenate the bucolic ideals of early America. Although the ending is pure American pat, the film proper is beautifully designed (Darren Guilford) and photographed (Claudio Miranda of Life of Pi fame).Oblivion is not great science fiction, just enjoyable fare for the summer. Cruise is still a top action dog, for my money, giving a stare that questions everything he encounters with a smile just a bit shy of rye. He's not comic here, but he is romantic while the story turns on love as much as finding a home. With the body of a 20 year old and an inward strength, Cruise should last as a hero well into his 70's, as apparently Harrison Ford will do as well.And so, Oblivion is derivative of Star Wars, Star Trek, Total Recall, The Matrix and a host of popular sci-fi adventures. However, enough originality and Cruise's durability mean you won't be wasting your money. Nor do you need to put up with 3-D.'If we have souls, they're made of the love we share.

Bohemian Rhapsody," One of the nest musical docudramas ever.
","'Now we're four misfits who don't belong together, we're playing for the other misfits. They're the outcasts, right at the back of the room. We're pretty sure they don't belong either. We belong to them.' Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek)
This is a 'Champion' musical biopic, a fine companion film this year to A Star is Born. The difference is more of Queen's music and less of the private anguishes of Star. Queen never before looked this regal with Freddie's gyrations and their music reminding us how much we loved the big songs, like those of ABBA, whose Mama Mia franchise made me hope also for a sequel to this stellar Queen musical.Like the song Rhapsody, this film might have instilled doubts that it could have endured the long take (6 min for the song, over 2 hours for the film). Yet, Freddie stays vigorously, infusing each scene with the energy of memorably operatic rock. When Queen invites its rock-concert audience to sing along with We Will Rock You, there's little the cinema audience can do other than raise its arms and sing.A disappointment of this estimable musical is the little time it gives to the other three Queen members, who are usually relegated to reaction shots. But, of course, the film and memories of the rock band are dominated by Freddie, who, like Mick, knew instinctively how to please an audience while he remained the epicenter of the action.The downward arc of this romantic tragedy begins when Freddie admits to his band that he has AIDS. Once that point has been reached, director Bryan Singer lets us linger on the possibilities without Freddie's informing everyone. It's not a maudlin time, but a celebration of the time Freddie haws left.When the band reconvenes, after Freddie's trying to go it alone, the Live Aid concert for Africa, 1985, proves a confirmation that, in the lineup of such greats as The Rolling Stones, Queen is every bit royalty. The re-creation of the concert is masterful.Five years later Freddie is dead.Without melancholy, and probably leaving many dark moments unaccounted for, Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration of one of the great rock bands of the 20th century, and one of its gifted musical artists, Freddie Mercury.This musical docudrama will rock you.",Null,1,2,5 November 2018
Burn After Reading," Go figure . . .
","'Every man is surrounded by a neighborhood of voluntary spies.' Jane Austen Go figure: The acting ensemble of the year and two acclaimed directors can't save a movie dud. The Coen brothers' Burn After Reading is a forced comedy about a couple of fitness center workers (played by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) who find a CIA memoir disc and attempt to extort $50,000 from the author, Osborne Cox (John Malkovich).I say 'forced' because even the best performance, Brad Pitt as knuckleheaded Hardbodies worker Chad Feldheimer, is wrenched out of an actor better suited to non comedy. Even George Clooney, who sharpened his comic timing in Three Kings, plays smarmy a bit too goofy ans sleazy for my taste.Long gone are the outrageous characters of my fav Coen comedies Raising Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy, and Fargoall of whom seemed to be underplaying compared to the attempts here.But it's Malkovich who takes the prize for the actor who brings his acidic, loud-mouthed, sneering persona into every role. Frances McDormand is nowhere near the shrewd good ol' girl in Fargo.Respite from the non subtle comes in the screwball comedic exchanges between Hardbodies employee Linda Litzke (McDormand) and Chad and a comical denouement with CIA brass scratching their heads over the absurd activities.I just wish the Coens had brought their quirky, iconoclastic attitude into this one.",Null,1,6,12 September 2008
Watchmen," Cerebral and entertaining
","Dr. Manhattan/John Osterman (Billy Crudup): 'Why would I save a world I no longer have any stake in?' It's not difficult to see why geeks all over the world love Alan Moore and David Gibbons' Watchmen graphic novel heroes if the complex, cerebral, and entertaining film of the same name is any indication. Heroes filled with angst, lust, and revenge rummage around the screen trying to make sense of their existential lives while figuring out how to save the world from nuclear holocaust. As he did in 300, director Zack Snyder makes memorable images surrounding challenging ideas.It is an alternate world of 1985 when Richard Nixon has a third term facing the awful decision to use nuclear weapons against Russia rather than allow it to bomb us first. That the ex-Mask superheros Watchmen are variously found to cause the nuclear tension while they come back to save the world is the delicious complication of this challenging film.Long it is at 161 minutes, but satisfying it is in the range of human emotions and conflicts befitting bickering gods of Greek legend and Star Trek fantasies. In fact, the godlike Dr. Manhattan is an authentic superhero, a scientist transformed by bad experiment into a superman deficient in the emotions the gods, from Browning to Roddenberry, have traditionally coveted.Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach/Walter Kovacs, providing the voice-over narrative about the return of the heroes, has a mask with floating inkblots, appropriately signaling the ambiguity of the hero and the world he is saving. But besides the satisfyingly ambiguous roles of the advanced X-Men like heroes, is a musical score equally spot on for meaning but also ironic in the extreme.For instance, after failing to rise to the occasion of intimacy with Silk Spectre II/Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), Night Owl II/Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) eventually responds by being aroused after heroic activity with her accompanied by the strains of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, both a sensual accompaniment and a send up of heroic seriousness. Additionally, Philip Glass's accompaniment to Dr. Manhattan's back story is close to perfection. The pure goal of all superhero stories is best described by Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode): 'And so began my path to conquest. Conquest not of men, but of the evils that beset them.'",Null,2,5,4 March 2009
The Italian Job," As a `re-interpretation' of the 1969 Michael Caine caper film, it stands up well with fast pace, fashion consciousness, and unique score.
","`The Italian Job' is a stylish heist film beginning in Venice with exciting photography of St. Mark's and canal boat chases. As a `re-interpretation' of the 1969 Michael Caine caper film, it stands up well with fast pace, fashion consciousness, and unique score.   Its modernization is primarily in technology: Computers can program all the stoplights in LA and graphically reproduce all the dimensions of a heist location.
Mark Wahlberg has taken Steve McQueen's place behind the 'Bullitt' wheel in a cute-as-hell mini Cooper, racing under LA streets as McQueen did above-ground in San Francisco. McQueen is a better actor; in fact, Wahlberg has a smile as his only defining emotion, but still better than his tepid recent roles in `The Truth about Charlie' and `Planet of the Apes.' (`Rock Star' is an exception, possibly because of his music experience).  Donald Sutherland's cameo as the grizzled veteran is worth the admission price, and director F. Gary Gray (`A Man Apart') shows he can pace a film with the best of them. Edward Norton would like you to forget his  traitor turn, and I find that easy to do.
Adding to the updated success is location shooting in Venice, LA, and Philadelphia by Wally Pfister, whose `Memento' cinematography is memorable. John Powell's (`Bourne Identity') musical score is modern without being intrusive. Additionally, some supporting roles are strong in concept and performance:  a computer nerd (Seth Green) claiming to be the original creator of `Napster,' a half deaf thief (too many M-80's at one time in a toilet bowl) called `Half' Ear (Mos Def), a tough crook called `Handsome Rob' (Jason Statham), and a lithe blonde (Charlize Theron) described as a 'professional vault & safe technician.'
The two major heists are carried with the watchful eye of an accountant and the spirit of `Ocean's 11.'  I laughed heartily at the outrageous but believable mechanics of removing huge safes but then remembered the equal true grace under pressure in `Rififi.' I also reflected that this is just summer (`The Hulk' is still to come), and I relaxed with my brain at rest and my sensibility tuned into just enjoying slick films which don't need to impress critics with lofty themes and remorseful protagonists.

","'Now I don't think I need to give you the speech about what would happen if you say no, how I could break your legs and kill everyone you love because you already know that, don't you.' Doc (Kevin Spacey) If you like your romantic heists with bite, such as above and as in Quentin Tarantino's films, Edgar Wright (Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy) has raised the style bar because Baby Driver is a major hoot as well as a solidly violent thriller. It's as if Tarantino took Tony Scott's True Romance and David Lynch's Wild at Heart and married them to his own Reservoir Dogs.It's all silly but so amusing as to be almost real. For those of us who love wise cracking and wise guys, Baby Driver is fully satisfactory: 'Don't feed me any more lines from 'Monsters Inc.'! It pisses me off!' Baby (Ansel Elgort) drives for heists to pay off a debt to Doc, a king pin planning robberies. Meeting a lovely waitress, childlike almost like himself, Debora (Lily James), Baby wants out of the driving business, but that's not easy. Doc has plans for his good luck charm, Baby.While things do get violent, with not much actual blood, it's the minimal-CGI driving of which Steve McQueen would fully approve and Drive's Ryan Gosling could only envy. Dick Pope's cinematography and the stunt driving magicians let you feel a part of the entertaining spins, flips, and reverses in an adrenaline rush usually reserved just for the drivers. Baby is a first-rate, formula-like driver with a stoic mien that drives even the seasoned hoods crazy.The film can rightly be called a car chase musical or a heist film cum romance. From Bellbottoms by Jon Spencer Blues Explosion to Tequila by the Button Down Brass and Brighton Rock by Queen to Nowhere to Hide by Martha and the Vandellas, the soundtrack is rockin' with dozens of oldies and goodies just right for plot and for keeping things, violent as they are, light.Baby moves to the beats of the music only he hears—with a good tune coming out of his ear plugs, he's the best driver of any heist you have ever seen.

Justice League," It's no Wonder Woman, but it has its moments.
","'People said the Age of Heroes would never come again.'Diana (Gail Godot)The super heroes of filmdom do come again, this time in Justice League, the DC equivalent of Marvel's Avengers and other comic book communal power sharing. Smartly producers are seeing that a super hero like Superman (Henry Cavill) or Batman (Ben Affleck) is better served by having more heroes to expand audience and humanize.In Justice League, Diana Prince is a welcome leader, having jumped into that spot no doubt because of her box office success in Wonder Woman early in 2017. Here she teams up with Cyborg, Flash, Batman, Aquaman, and Superman (recently resurrected) to defeat Steppenwolf (voice of Ciaran Hinds), who is bent on bringing back power and global destruction to the dark side. The team motif, so popular in pulp fiction and sci fi these days, is best expressed by Commissioner Gordon (J.K. Simmons) to Batman: 'Good to see you playing with others again.' Oh, well, nothing new here, especially with the usual out-of-date explosions and knock-abouts, both to me not worthy of advanced sci-fi but along with bullets, staples of the genre. The reliance here on fist fighting and gun shooting seems beneath the dignity of advanced civilizations such as ours. The banter is banal, and the wonder of the Wonder Woman film earlier this year places this epic in mediocre land far, far away from the Amazons.With so much run-of-the-mill CGI as a central focus, no wonder plot is thin and characterization superficial. While director Zack Snyder tries to give enough time to each character to develop, too many of them mean too little rounding out their personalities and lives. What we have is what we have—a middling story of the same stuff told with characters just waiting for their own next motion picture.

Man of Steel," Unnecessary destruction almost every minute
","'You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world.' Jonathan Clark (Kevin Costner) Man of Steel is more explosive than existential. Or in the words of a non-critic leaving the preview: 'There was an awful lot of unnecessary destruction.' My nightmare has come true—maybe the most sacred super hero story is reduced to the rubble that piles up in almost 2 ½ hours of the Superman back story, loaded with mayhem, be it with childhood accidents young Clark Kent must attend to or the bad guys from Krypton playing nasty with earth.You got it: I dislike a surfeit of destruction, and this sci-fi actioner is chock-full of it. Funny thing, though, you'd think director Zack Snyder would avoid images of Metropolis buildings falling down that remind us of 9/11. However, the hours are filled with disintegrating structures and their skeletons that are too similar to the iconic destruction of lower Manhattan a dozen years ago. Anyway, abundant destruction, not enough dialogue.The time spent on Krypton is too much with too little importance for the earth story as Superman's father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), sends baby Kal-El (Henry Cavil) to our planet. Then more unnecessary time is spent in Kansas as adoptive dad and mom (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) help him determine what kind of a human he'd like to be. 'Unnecessary' because the heart of the Superman story is his adventures as an adult, which mirror the struggles of simple folk everywhere writ much larger.More waste in the little attention paid to the rich possibilities of challenges with Clark's girlfriend (Lois Lane is played by a competent and not impressive Amy Adams). Lawrence Fishburne brings promise to the role of editor Perry White, a part woefully underused. Michael Shannon as General Zod, very bad guy from Krypton, has so few good lines that any mean looking dude could have played him. That homely bowl haircut, though, is distracting.

28 Weeks Later," Not a bad thing.
","28 Weeks Later, the sequel to 28 Days Later, gamely carries on the tradition of intelligent zombie movies. The rage virus is back, and two kids may carry the antibody in their blood. Get them the hell out of a London that in its griminess rivals the stunning cinematography and dark set design of Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men.Tough for me to advise anyone to leave the greatest town on earth, but the heroes need to go across the sea, getting there bloodier than ever. Although the new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is more interested in special effects and quick cutting than the original's Danny Boyle, he does spare the outright revulsion should we ever see what cannibalism looks like up close, personal, and slow.The dark passages and twisting camera, coupled with machine-gun rapid shots, make the movie frequently inscrutable, not a big deal to horror fans but a frustration to us commoners who think the premise has promise of showing human nature at its Darwinian worst if we can only figure out what's happening. That mysterious mise en scene keeps us from connecting with the principals as we did with Cillian Murphy's and Naomie Harris's characters in 28 Days Later.But gore is to the fore, and that's just fine with those who first screamed at zombies in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and laughed at them in Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead. What I said about 28 Days Later shows what's missing in its sequel: 'The eerie set design is appropriate without being overdone (Rod Serling would have approved its restraint), the characters are real without being overwrought (especially the women, who are usually sacrificed to too much emoting), and the subtexts about contemporary crises are clear without distracting from the science fiction genre itself.' Correlations with HIV and Iraq are not as easy as they were with the original.It's a nail biter and organ orgy, with just enough scary false starts and stupid people. I was engaged the whole time, except when an attractive film critic gave me her zombie embrace out of sheer fright. That's not a bad thing.",Null,38,80,9 May 2007
The Village," A less harrowing experience than his other films but a more intellectually satisfying one
","The very noun `village' connotes a closed community often out of time in an outer world grown increasingly forbidding.  M. Night Shyamalan's (`Sixth Sense,' `Signs') `The Village' incorporates those notions and more modern isolationism and xenophobia stemming from ultraconservative politics and `9/11' to create a less harrowing experience than his other films but a more intellectually satisfying one.A late nineteenth-century hamlet in rural America is plagued by threats from monsters in its forest to the extent that the town fortifies itself with encircling high torches and a watchtower along with animals sacrificed and tossed to the woods as supplication. The fortified Utopia has the simple architecture of a Shaker Village and speech patterns in a stilted English often associated in depictions of Puritan life. There is a similarity to Arthur Miller's `Crucible' and the attendant problems of dealing with the unknown, in that case witchcraft and in this one, vague outside forces only briefly sited looking like red-cloaked college football celebrants with Howard Hughes nails and guttural speech like theirs after being over served.Associated with the frustrating search for a perfect existence as chronicled from Thomas More to Hawthorne and now Shyamalan is the constant need to adjust for imperfection especially in the human body.  So medicine from the city is frequently the catalyst for facing the developed world; `The Village' is no different.  Rather than facing the disrupting intruder, the recluses must become intruders themselves to survive. In this film a striking parallel occurs with a `Twilight Zone' episode, in which Cliff Robertson's settler wagon train must send a member over the hill for medicine. Facing the outside world means endangering all that you have guarded from it but possibly saving your life.A sub theme of the power of love nicely parallels the isolation one. Each character seems to struggle with embracing and exposing love not without dire consequences. William Hurt is believably torn by his and the other elders' decision to live and love apart.  His blind daughter, played disarmingly by Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, expectedly sees more clearly than anyone else, and Joaquin Phoenix creates the right mood of ambivalence about the whole isolation. Only Adrian Brody as a disturbed troublemaker is underdeveloped as a character.  Yet he does point out the obvious corollary that the enemy may be within.The teens in my audience were restless for at least the first hour because the solemn tone and stilted conversation seemed as old as the village.  They were certainly not ready to forsake a good scare for lofty idealism, a good Shyamalan plot twist for an existential exploration of life's purpose for the social being.`The Village' has Shyamalan's patented twist but not as shocking as those in `Signs' and `Sixth Sense.' The writer/director here reinforces the notion that `these days isolationism is not a good policy,' as the fat Ferrari warned Rick in `Casablanca.'",Null,1,2,31 July 2004
21," No Will Hunting
","'There are two great pleasures in gambling: that of winning and that of losing.' French proverbThere has to be an easier way to finance Harvard Medical School than being beaten up by Laurence Fishburne's Cole Williams in your gig as a blackjack card counter in Las Vegas. But genius MIT senior Ben (Jim Sturgess) is recruited by charismatic math professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) to join a team of five other MIT brainiacs, who don't make the casinos happy when detectives such as Williams figure out their scam.Director Robert Luketic's 21, based on the true story of six MIT students who took Vegas for millions, should give an inside insight into this high-stakes world, but in fact the only high is the number of quick-cuts that keep us from any access to either side of the game. The disappointingly slow plot (even the Ocean's franchise is more interesting, and certainly more glamorous) plods rather than cracklesI found MIT's Will Hunting (Matt Damon) story more engaging, and he didn't even go to Vegas.Undeniably watchable as always is Kevin Spacey's Mickey, with an icy confidence compromised only by a silly denouement finding this brilliant gamester reduced to clichés about a turn of fortune that comes too quickly to a stats guy, who in real life could have seen what was coming by just remembering not numbers but the eye in the sky at casinos. Cool Danny Ocean (cool George Clooney) he is not; Lex Luthor he should channel.The glittering neon of Vegas is well represented, but the new day of computer facial profiling replacing house dicks is unfortunately underdeveloped, leaving some old-fashioned roughing rather than new-fangled software to carry the tension. The famous cliché about naughtiness staying in Vegas could apply to this tepid tease of a drama: Leave it in Las Vegas.",Null,5,18,26 March 2008
The Revenant," Leo has a shot at an Oscar. And the film, too.
","'Nature red in tooth and claw' TennysonThe 19th century's romanticism and growing naturalism inspired Tennyson to describe in these lines the dark side as Darwin would change forever our benign view of man and nature. Director/writer Alejandro Gonzalez Innarritu and writer Mark L. Smith adapt Michael Punke's novel in a naturalistic way that makes the 156 minutes seem as long as it must have taken noted explorer Hugh Glass (Leo DiCaprio) in the 1820's to recover from being buried alive in the wilderness he helped open.After being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his comrade in trapping, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who also murders Glass's son in front of him, Glass drags himself 200 miles! back to civilization to exact revenge. Although it is a survival/revenge story, with the usual formulaic occurrences, DiCaprio and Hardy succeed in making it real, tortured, and visceral in the extreme. I can try to guess how much discomfort DiCaprio went through for this Oscar-worthy performance, which lacks only the variety and nuance of speech that characterizes frequent Oscar winners. What the role demands and delivers is the almost insane will to survive and revenge.A heavy dose of naturalism (not just realism but realism with bedrock of rawness and violence) is best exemplified in the mother bear protecting her cubs by savaging Glass, a tour de force scene. The Pawnee Indians also illustrate the harsh world with one chief briefly cataloguing what the white man has taken from the tribes.Needless to say, the cinematography by Tree of Life's Emmanuel Lubezki is stunning in sharp grey to reflect the winter conditions that contrast with the snow. Rarely does the sun shine, and in figurative terms it shouldn't because this is a grim world where animal pelts are a man's riches, and a life can be lost for a simple miscalculation or an indifference bred of Nature's seeming carelessness for human life.Glass accepts, as all must, Nature's final demand: 'I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already.'",Null,9,20,8 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," A base hit, no more.
","'No game in the world is as tidy and dramatically neat as baseball, with cause and effect, crime and punishment, motive and result, so cleanly defined.' Paul Gallico The Trouble with the Curve is that there is no 'curve ball' in the script, which seems almost computerized from the baseball-cliché app. However, for those who couldn't get enough of crusty Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino, he's back for more curmudgeon as Gus, an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves who eschews sabermetrics and all such scientific analysis in favor of old fashioned gut work, especially hearing the sound of a ball hitting a glove and a ball hitting a bat. First-time director Robert Lorenz, a producer for many Eastwood films, makes sure the heroic Eastwood hero follows the formulaic plays so long a part of the Eastwood game.Difficult Gus doesn't much abide his accomplished daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), whose bid for partnership in her law office is a sign that he may have done something right, not that he would ever talk to her of his feelings about anything. She accompanies him scouting out a potential star in North Carolina as she sees how his eyesight has deteriorated and could need help.But Gus, in vintage Eastwood style, accepts no help, and so the story slips into formula with Mickey romancing a former star, Johnny (Justin Timberlake); a young Braves scout, Philip (Matthew Lillard), getting his comeuppance, and the world improbably going everyone's way at the most contrived, vapid, and neatly tied together conclusion in baseball film history. In other words original material is absent, Moneyball looks like Citizen Kane next to this froth, and both films share a similar combat between the old scouts and the upstarts with their computers. In Moneyball the metrics win out; in Trouble the gut does its job.But then, in most Eastwood movies, with him as director or just actor, the bullies are humiliated and the old guys win the match. The young women, e.g., in Million Dollar Baby and Trouble, gritty though they are, learn and win largely because they're Clint's protégés.Baseball is never like that except in the movies.",Null,7,19,21 September 2012
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg and Hanks--fry to find a better duo than that for a great film.
","'Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters.' James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks)In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the historical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and Lincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to defend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in order to show the world the American justice system is democratic. The story is 'inspired by true events' with the outline of the exchange of Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As usual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and film noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold War. He said, 'I always wanted to tell the stories that really interested me in my personal life—which are stories about things that actually happened.'Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the odds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and the individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy card; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but always righteous. The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and Hanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: 'Aren't you worried?' Rudolf Abel: 'Would it help?' As producer Kristie Macosko Krieger commented about Spielberg, 'He's got a childlike sense of wonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . ' Bridge of Spies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous hero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming with humanity.

Kevin (James McAvoy) So warns one of a couple dozen personalities played by a game and convincing McAvoy, whose 23 Dissociative-Identity-Disorder (DID) central characters people the messy Split. Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan has crafted an abduction thriller cum multiple personality disorder with his signature twisted ending, but overall not near the greatness of The Sixth Sense, Signs, or even the more recent The Visit.Three teens are abducted by Kevin et al., whose promise that a 'Beast' is coming to devour them does spook the bejesus out of them. The more canny of the three, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy from the surprisingly effective The Witch), is the heroine destined to grapple with that Beast and the personalities that wander around this bunker-like world (Remember the locale of 10 Cloverfield Lane?) The director directs way too many close-ups of her for my taste, and the usual horror tropes like jump scares aren't sufficient to mask a fragmented plot that mirrors the split personality disorders. Outside forces like the kindly shrink, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), are actually peripheral to the power of Dennis and his army of identities.Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill used a split personality motif to explain bad behavior; Hitchcock, a big influence on De Palma and Shyamalan, used most of Split's bag of tricks, especially in Psycho, long before Shyamalan knew what personality was; United States of Tara showcased for TV the DID state to some notable success. Split will not meet the 'classic' criteria they have achieved.Because payoff for Shyamalan has always been the twist ending, he doesn't so much disappoint as confuse, with unfortunate explanations that sap the challenges a smart thriller should offer.'I've never seen a case like this before.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Potheads should be happy.
","For the first part of the seventh film about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, potheads might feel a little smarter as the intrepid trio is getting older and a tad wiser themselves. For me, a cynic about any series going beyond three, I was pleased to see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Wattson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) pursuing death with a vengeance and doing some philosophical reflecting. In fact, it is as much an affirmation of life as it is obsessed with death. Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is so strong now that Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic are under his power. The trio tries to find and destroy Horcruxes, which are shards of his soul, so as to destroy him. The usual explosions, magic horses, and all sorts of wild things inhabit the landscape as they have in the past six episodes.What's slightly different here is that sex and death are major players, and not necessarily in that order. Sex to the extent that the stirrings of the three teens are a constant challenge with Ron on the losing side (at least the pubescent longings of the sixth have passed, a virtue unknown to the Twilight series). Death to the extent that they seek the Dark Lord's death and acknowledge parents' passing as well as those who die so Harry may live.Director David Yates still stretches scenes beyond what even Rowling may have envisioned, and he still fails to enliven Harry beyond his constantly benign befuddlement. But this time he has given depth to characters commensurate with their growth and intelligence. No magic there, just living.",Null,0,3,18 November 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," You'll laugh, too.

Shakespeare, Lear So you think any one of these summer comedies could be called the best of the year: Scoop, Clerks II, You, Me and Dupree, Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest. Not so when you see Little Miss Sunshine, a certifiable winner for the year with a fraction of their budgets and more wit than even the Woodman can employ.Think National Lampoon's Vacation with moments of important social conscience. The Hoover family is traveling by VW bus from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach for the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker whose 9 step program has no real effect on an essentially slacking family, including potty-mouthed, tell-it-all-like-it-is grandpa (Alan Arkin) as hilariously out of place here as he is in the world. Brother-in-law Frank has tried suicide more than once, in part because his closest academic rival may have proved to be the best living Proust scholar rather than Frank.My bus broke down as does theirs. They always do on long trips. As with the Hoovers, however, lessons can be learned and humanity tapped on such disastrous outings. Sunshine strips the pretense from the whole family, threatening to make them normal and loving, and certifying after they see the pageant, that they will never enter little sister is such an American tragedy again.I guess all American long trips are a metaphor for the growth of our country and the flowering of character. This film shows more character development than most of the films this summer combined. Dad's self-help program's mantra is 'Refuse to lose,' as apt a chant for this family as could be.

Knowing," Wasted number of minutes
","122No special meaning attached to that number, just the number of minutes I wasted watching Knowing, knowing that Nicholas Cage will usually take any job that comes along in rarely a quality film (Adaptation (2002) was the last good one, I believe). John Koestler (Cage), an astrophysicist from MIT, discovers meaning in a random list of numbers pulled from a fifty year old time capsule.It doesn't take him long to figure out the numbers predict disasters since 1959; what he never figures out is what a disaster the film is, a compendium of sci-fi clichés from creepy mute Aryans to a clueless MIT professor, who continues to put him and his motherless son in harms way through stupidity hardly becoming an intellectual.That Koestler lost his wife last year seems a staple now of the genre; that he meets an attractive single mom crucial to the solving of the mystery is another common element. That no meaningful thematic or character development issues color the bland here is painfully obvious after that grueling 122 minutes The last line of the film is, 'This is not the end.'

Coriolanus," The Bard bears up in the 20th Century.
","'If Greece has taught us that marble bleeds, Rome shows us that dust flowers.' Cecil Roberts.Shakespeare's tragedy, Coriolanus, directed by Ralph Fiennes, has been successfully translated to the screen, just as Richard III (1995) was by Richard Loncraine. Both productions shift the scene to modern times, and despite my prejudice about tinkering with the Bard, I liked both, in part because Fiennes is a fine Coriolanus and Ian McKellen a better than fine Richard.It's modern Rome, besieged by angry citizens whose leader is Gerard Butler's Aufidius, longtime enemy of Coriolanus. When the haughty, anti-commoner Coriolanus is banished from Rome, he joins up with his old enemy to turn on Rome.It seems like a perfect alliance until Coriolanus's formidable mother, Volumnia, played by Vanessa Redgrave, and his wife, VIrgilia, played by Jessica Chastain, confront him. To see the four leads on the screen, along with the reliable Brian Cox as Menenius, is to witness the best of cinema acting, although Redgrave dominates as she pleads, cajoles, and finesses her son to speak gently to the commoners and to compromise the siege.There is something static about the filming, perhaps because Fiennes sees it in its Shakespearean form and himself as a theatrical performer. 'Static' even though Fiennes relies on MTV-like quick cuts to enhance the action and perhaps mitigate the elegant prose for regular film goers.The contemporary thematic parallels with the play are obvious: the puzzle that still is the Balkans, or Iraq and Iran for that matter, with families pitted against each other, the citizenry versus the military, and power another deal away.But the play's the thing, and no matter how much gifted director and adapter play with the original, Shakespeare is always there with stunning dialogue, deep characterization, and humanity still crazy after all these years.",Null,12,24,15 January 2012
Hugo," It's all magic.
","'As if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen . . . T.S. EliotGeorges Melies for many movie buffs represents the love affair with imaginative filmmaking at its earliest. Inspired by the Lumiere brothers' short film, Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat (1897), Melies went on in the early years of the 20th century to create such flights of fancy as A Trip to the Moon (1902) with a rocket ship hitting the eye of the Man in the Moon. Martin Scorsese loves movies and their celluloid preservation, so Hugo is no surprise as a fantasy of an early '30's orphan living in the walls of a French train station restoring an automaton invented by Melies (Sir Ben Kingsley), who now owns a toy store in the station. Young Hugo (Asa Butterfiled) and his friend Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) adventure into the world of artifice and romance called movies.In the discovery of Melies' extant footage, Scorsese makes a strong case for preservation of the old combustible celluloid, a lifelong crusade of his. Yet the heart of the film is the boy's emerging love of cinema, like Scorsese's, reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso and Super 8. I think of Woody Allen's reverie about the '20's, Midnight in Paris, for the nostalgic recreation of a romantic era in the arts. For both auteurs, movies are an artistic expression and a way to meet the past.Although Scorsese uses ample CGI and 3-D, the opening alone is a marvel of swooping in on the train, its station, digital crowds, and ultimately the hidden boy, like our secret selves descending on a movie set. It reminds me of Mike Nichols' opening sequence to Working Girl, where his camera flies down like a god on and into the Staten Island ferry. In this case Scorsese uses 3-D in a way I have rarely seen—the right way. It's all magical.Melies began as a magician, and Hugo's father made a living in his shop for mechanical wonderments, both no doubt a paean to special effects. It's how modern Martin continues the fantasy by smoothly creating another world, as he did in The Age of Innocence, this time a world he knows intimately: the paradise of cinema.",2,7,21,27 November 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," `T3' does outpace the narrow genetics of `Hulk,' the impersonality of `Xmen,' and the inscrutable plot of `The Matrix.'
","Jonathan Mostow's (`U-571') `Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' effectively predicts the near-decimation of the human race by machines through their invincible weapon, computer software.The hope is that John Connor (Nick Stahl, `In the Bedroom') and his lieutenant, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes, `The Hours'), can repopulate the resistance with the survival help of Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-1000 robot, which is truly `back' from 2029 by way of a time machine.The new T-X killing machine is a superior female whom Arnie describes as faster and more intelligent than he, a moment of truth I found endearing and a tribute to the overall sophistication of the film, which also has Arnold reprising many of his famous one-liners with tongue firmly in cheek and about as dry as the Mojave Desert.It's that female robot that so intrigues me: Athletic-looking  Kristanna Loken inhabits the role like Naomi Watts on steroids, a blonde who can morph in a second, sometimes into an even more voluptuous lady to avoid a speeding ticket. She throws Arnie around like a stuffed animal, he looking pectorally perfect in advancing middle age, but more than this she figuratively establishes the evolution of women as superior to men in the future.Because of the egregious number of explosions and weapons in general, `T-3' misses the opportunity to build further on Arnie's wit, the theme of computer enslavement, and the emergence of women as an invincible productive and destructive force. It doesn't come close enough to George Meredith's observation that the 'God of this world is in the machine, not out of it.'`T3' does outpace, however, the narrow genetics of `Hulk,' the impersonality of `Xmen,' and the inscrutable plot of `The Matrix.'  It also wins the race for the best race of the year, in which a giant crane on a truck levels a building while jousting with a fire truck.I wanted more thought in this film and less action.  After all, I am inextricably welded to the challenges my computer offers me everyday, hoping someone will tame the ever-expanding gigabytic tyrant. Alas, it's not T3 who will save me but maybe my 800 Gateway number. However, the film is much more fun than a morning making that call.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
The Orphanage," A thinking person's sojourn
","'Most of what we object to as misconduct in children is a natural rebellion against the intrusion of an unimaginative adult despotism in their lives.' Floyd Dell, Were You Ever a Child? Turn of the Screw by way of Others, Lord of the Flies, Sixth Sense, and myriad suspense, horror, and science fiction films and literature: The Orphanage is a respectable Spanish contribution to the depiction of children as masters of the house, be they real or spirits.The Orphanage has crisp cinematography that accentuates the old Orphanage's lurid corners and closets wherein may hide the supernatural forms of past inhabitants and the hope of the current mistress of the house to find her son lost to the history and lure of the home.The clichés of horror fiction abound: No one, much less physician husband, believes mom that the house is haunted; the admirable score provides a measure of scary telegraphing; each nook and cranny has the potential to shock the unwary; the denouement is predictable right down to the conversion of the most wary. However, the Hitchcock-like suspense is masterfully executed, not like the slam of current slasher films. There is little blood, just enough disfigurement, and surprises such as the haunting cameo by Geraldine Chaplin, a medium heating the suspense and converting the skeptical.Like any thinking person's sojourn into the spiritual, the Orphanage doesn't quickly make a case for ghosts; rather it poses questions such as how far into a psyche should a mother go before Oedipus kicks up a royal storm, or how far a husband, or even responsible administrators should go to support an unstable-appearing wife.Nothing is new for the genre, but the look is classic, the acting above average, and the kids still hold the attention of adults, who, like the audience, know enough to respect the power of innocence unbound.",Null,10,18,7 January 2008
"I, Robot"," Continues the intriguing topic of what it means to be human
","Robots in the arts have always been intriguing. Isaac Asimov promoted them in science fiction to remind us as humans to celebrate our emotions and imperfections, usually coveted by our mechanical creations even with the prospect of death as the ultimate payment due.Director Alex Proyas' ('The Crow') 'I, Robot,' based on Asimov's story, packs every robot cliché into a year 2035 morality tale, visually satisfying (The CGI, like good robots, is at the service of the story) and regurgitating the usual robot notions: Frankenstein's monster is there with his conflicted maker; the Maria clone from 'Metropolis' with her sleek form; Robbie from 'Forbidden Planet' with his warm, human-like solicitation; Hal from '2001' with his dangerous deference only slightly hiding his intentions; and Data, 'Star Trek's' almost human techie, coming closest to the ideal.More robotic than 'I, Robot's' robots is Will Smith's ('Ali') Del Spooner, guess what, a wise-ass, rebellious cop who is the only one who intuits the danger of the robotic rumblings. He unsurprisingly enlists the help of the beautiful, coldly calculating scientist, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, 'The Recruit'), who, believe it or not, comes to believe the robots can violate their 3 basic rules of serving humans to their own annihilation if necessary. US Robotics head, Lawrence Robinson (Bruce Greenwood), is, of course, the major suspect in the incipient revolution, ostensibly because of the usual world-domination dreams.'Sunny' (Alan Trudyk, 'Dodgeball') is the new generation robot, not as overtly ambitious as his forebears and more human because of his resignation to decommissioning while exploring human emotions. Spooner, on the other hand, seems to be more of a robot, which, like some contemporary leaders, sees the enemy as a danger to be overcome rather than a work in progress to be gently ushered into peaceful co-existence. Also, the rogue robots talk about dominating humans for their own good, just as neocons offer preemption and occupation rather than debate.The last line of 'I, Robot' addresses the human urge for liberty and the necessity of searching for it. The film adds nothing new to the genre but athletic robots and robotic leads, yet it at least continues the intriguing topic of what it means to be human.

Sloan (Morgan Freeman)It's never comfortable to find out your estranged father was a great assassin, nor is it comforting to know that his ancient 'Fraternity' of assassins needs you to avenge your father's death. A little Hamlet, a bit of Matrix, and a tad of Da Vinci Code, Wanted tells of Wesley Gibson's (James McAvoy) change from a 'pussy' account manager to a world-class assassin under the guidance of Fraternity teachers Fox (Angelina Jolie ) and Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Wanted doesn't lack for imagination in its magical realism of bullets bending in flight and wounds miraculously disappearing, nor does it lack for clichés and stereotypes of the thriller genre, including car chases as good as any others in contemporary cinema. After all, that CGI stuff is what American films do best, often at the expense of crisp dialogue or deep characterization.Even the actors are their own stereotypes: Jolie's Fox (now that's truth in advertising) plays a dangerous operative who can shoot a giant firearm as if she were Lara Croft; Freeman's voice once again soothes the savages; James McAvoy does the Toby Maguire innocence just right. And although Jolie has the least dialogue, and probably the biggest salary, the shot of her backside may be the most memorable image outside the spectacular train wreck high over a gorge.As in so many action-packed, hero-driven movies today, the hunt is not just for bad guys but also for who the hero is as a person, a quest saving these summer sellouts from shameless superficiality.

Sleeper spy syndrome is at work here.The stars are running this summerâ€”DiCaprio from the law as he plies his corporate espionage craft in Inception, Tom Cruise from his own spy agency as they brand him a rogue, and Jolie as we can see from the above. Must be something in the summer air or in their careers as they move up in age, Jolie 35, DiCaprio 36, and Cruise a healthy but aging 48. And the winner: Jolie for pure fantasy heroics, Lara Croft on steroids with an audience willing to accept the most outlandish setups and screw-ups in the name of summer escapism. She and her doubles jump from truck to truck on the freeway to far outdo Cruise in his contrasting minimalist athletic excesses with moving vehicles.

The Battle of Algiers," An unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.
","In 1962 after more than 130 years of French colonial rule, Algeria became independent.  Gillo Pontecorvo's `Algiers' shows the decade leading to that liberation in a powerful story about Muslims asserting their rights through violence, hiding, and plotting in the Kasbah, a demiworld of narrow, winding, seemingly endless alleys that are the only protection the rebels have from the eyes of the French.  The re-release of the 1965 black and white film is a convincing story of a people who do not want to be occupied and will give their lives so their families can one day be free.The story centers on a couple of Muslim leaders, the charismatic Col. of the French forces, and the bombings and shootouts that at one point averaged just over 4 per day. The film's sympathy is for the Muslims, but the Colonel has moments of reflection that could be sympathetic, especially with the revelation that he was a member of the resistance in WWII and may have suffered in a concentration camp. The director shows the influence of Italian neo-realists like Roberto Rossellini (`Paisan') by shooting in documentary style on location, using non-actors (except for the Colonel), and generally avoiding an agitprop angle.But the film's sympathy in the end belongs to the occupied people.  When 3 rebel women change appearance to look French, infiltrate, and plant bombs, the irony obvious to American audiences in their current struggle is a tribute to the strength of the narration and characterization and the universal dislike of occupation and subjugation.The torture of the Muslim prisoners is the most poignant relevance to the recent scandal in Iraq.  The Colonel's justification for the practice to gain life-saving information is classic `ends-justify-the-means' logic still being used by great nations. In fact, the Pentagon reportedly had seen this film during the first days of the second Iraq War; some say they learned nothing from the film, which is an unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.",Null,85,104,13 May 2004
Disturbia," Be a guiltless voyeur again.
","You won't hear much about the influence of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 Rear Window on Disturbia possibly because anything remotely nostalgic or educational will alienate a young audience. Too bad, because S.J. Caruso does much better with Hitch than Gus Van Sant did with his 1998 remake of Psycho.Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a stay-at-home teen with an ankle bracelet monitor for clocking his Spanish teacher. Ashley (Sarah Roemer) is the new neighbor, looking good in a swimsuit at her pool. What's a housebound boy to do for three months but spy on her and his other neighbors with his binoculars? Enter Hitch's Jimmy Stewart in a wheelchair looking out into his apartment complex. Both are hypnotized by their voyeurism, both sexual and criminal, as they try to figure out if a suspicious neighbor is a murderer.However, while Hitch relies on crisp dialogue between Stewart, Thelma Ritter, and Grace Kelly, Caruso relies too much on flashy camera shots and predictable dialogue to create a classic makeover. Moreover, Hitch's sub-theme about marriage is almost as intriguing as the major topic about the active versus passive life. Disturbia is mostly about what is seen rather than suggested.But Disturbia is fun: David Morse as Turner, a suspicious neighbor, is charming and menacinghe'll never be out of work playing this character. LaBeouf is credible as an older, wiser teen still trying to make sense of a life that lost his father too soon. What happens to them all can be predicted if you know Rear Window; if you don't, predict anyway because the plot twists, scary false starts, and incredulous authorities have been played hundreds of times since Alfred Hitchcock so handily turned out his classic over 50 years ago.Be a guiltless voyeur againsee Disturbia.",Null,1,12,11 April 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," It's a platinum lining, not just silver.
","'I'm remaking myself.' Pat (Bradley Cooper)Silver Linings Playbook doesn't play by the current romantic comedy book—No scatology, nudity, f-bombing, or feminist and gay bashing. It's simply a smart playbook about the mental institution's recently-released Pat Solitano (Cooper, shedding his Hangover boy-man shtick), who may be saner than his dad, an OCD gambler (Robert De Niro), and Bradley's new friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).But that comparison is all relative because director David O. Russell (remember his funky family in Flirting with Disaster?) allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized. After some serious outbursts of anger, Pat starts training for a dance competition with Tiffany in order to make contact with and eventually impress his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee).The eventualities of the story are not half as stimulating as the plot along the way, some of the best scenes centered around the family squabbling about the Philadelphia Eagles or Pat's relationship with that 'slut,' Tiffany. When Pat confronts his parents at 4 AM about the deficiency of Hemingway's ending to A Farewell to Arms and when Russell places under another scene Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash singing Girl from the North Country, you know you're in a film that follows no particular playbook.The dynamics as fostered by these superior actors are some of the best ensemble work this year. In fact, this is so far the best of the romantic comedies in recent memory. Pat and Tiffany may be bi-polar, but they can dance the stars into your eyes. Jennifer Lawrence plays so different a character from those in Winter's Bone and Hunger Games that it may take you a scene or two to recognize her. But when she dances, you'll confirm she's one of the best young actresses in Hollywood, and this film one of the best of the year.",Null,135,213,16 November 2012
Van Helsing," This film tries to entertain too many literary and film icons.
","Even `X-Men's' heroic Hugh Jackman can't save `Van Helsing' from sinking in computer graphics and lurid costumes as it assembles the great 30's a 40's monsters like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Wolf Man from the old Universal Pictures. Like `League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' this film tries to entertain too many literary and film icons so it ends up sliding over the surface of promising characterizations for the usual American overdose of special effects.Jackman plays 19th-century Dr. Gabriel Van Helsing, who is to rid the world of these creatures, whereas he should be removing `The Mummy's' director Stephen Sommers' from any influence over dialogue for future horror flicks. When Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) says he tortures because `It's what I do,' the best line of the show is not more than an anachronistic cliché.  Some of the dialogue attempts a modern, casual irony better suited to `Die Hard' action than a hybrid of horror and comedy.However, visually `Van Helsing' is impressive: The comely young women/bats in Dracula's harem wear form-fitting body suits that demand attention, fly with acrobatic aplomb, and show dentally dynamic incisors at the right transforming moments. Wolf Man is hugely menacing, powerful and realistic with dental work every bit as impressive as the ladies'. The waist of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) is corseted as small as those of the schoolgirls in `Picnic at Hanging Rock.' As for the embarrassing accents, neither she nor Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula should consider other work asking for anything but their native speech.The film relies like many other American offerings too much on special effects; it seems every transition is loaded with action like the race with 2 six-horse coaches or Van Helsing shooting his rotary-magazine crossbow. The CGI power comes a bit, I suspect, from the dark frames, where more precise detail can be ignored and the background mattes overwhelm like dark drapes.The best example of where this film goes wrong is with Frankenstein's monster, who turns out to be likeable in the way homely Shrek is. Although in `Prometheus' Percy Shelley described `Phantasms so foul through monster-teeming Hell,' Mary Shelley created her monster with affection. Like P.B. Shelley, James Whales scared the heck out of his audience with an ugly, pathetic, uncivilized hybrid. `Van Helsing' is more Mary than Percy and monstrously far from Whales.",Null,1,2,6 May 2004
Divergent," Good old-fashioned young adult thriller
","'You're different. You don't fit into a category. They can't control you. They call it Divergent.' Tori (Maggie Q)Does Divergent diverge from the YA formula established by the Twilight series and fattened by the Hunger Games franchise? Not much. But I have to admit I was carried along by the interesting sci-fi story and solid performances of lead Shailene Woodley (Tris) and Theo James (Four). In other words, my intellect was teased by the allegory and my heart by the true romance. Divergent is just good old-fashioned young-adult storytelling that engages adults and teens at the same time.Faced with making a choice of what category of five the teen chooses to belong to for a lifetime (Erudite, Candor, Amity, Dauntless, and Abnegation) Tris chooses the protector group Dauntless, while knowing she doesn't fit any (that's why she's 'Divergent') group. Already you can see the author, Veronica Roth, has allegory in mind, viz., a caste system that freezes people forever in a category (surely a great fear of teenagers) and a social order that allows similarities to flourish but individuality not.The Katniss of Divergent, Tris (shortened from Beatrice, an allusion, perhaps, to Dante's guide into hell), is not as glamorous as Katniss (but then that's relative since Jennifer Lawrence is not a classic beauty either), nor as skilled initially, but she has a reserve and humility, as well as interior demons, that can endear her to the audiences' sense of their own flawed humanity.Like other young adult fiction, Divergent plays to teen fears and a societal concern about stifling individuality. By overcoming the former and becoming who she is meant to be for the latter, Tris embodies the ideals of a healthy democracy and individuality. And as Woodley plays her, a normal teen with normal hang-ups and some abnormal potential. Just don't buy into the airbrushed posters with her perfect bod—she's only fairly good looking and fairly flawed.If that's not enough to get you to this actioner, see Kate Winslet play a bad Erudite named Jeanine—she's quite believable and quite different from her carefully framed persona of a simpering goodie. Wait. Wait. She is expressing her individuality as a talented actress. She's divergent!'The system removes the threat of anyone exercising their independent will. Divergents threaten that system. It won't be safe until they're removed.' Jeanine (Kate Winslet)",Null,1,5,25 March 2014
The White Ribbon," Artful analysis of evil's origins
","'My God, why won't you just die?' The doctor to his mistress in White Ribbon.Director Michael Haneke seems quite comfortable with ambiguity, as I am, if you remember the uncertain identity of the clandestine videographer in Cache and now witness the strange events in a small northern German town at the cusp of the 20th century just before WWI. That ambiguity allows interpretations that range from original sin to the coming of the Nazis.Random bad luck such as a farm wife falling through rotten floor boards to a wire strung to trip a horse and its rider plagues a very ordered, even stern, small town without anyone being able to solve the mystery. The most plausible and outrageous solution is the children, but proof is non existent. Besides, as in life itself, many adults qualify. The allegorical implications of children being readied for Nazi crimes against mankind in the next half century are clear, so looking for symbolic clues among caged birds and repressed love is legitimate. You'll not see a better artful analysis currently about the origins of evil.The title itself refers to ribbons affixed to malefactors to remind them of their sins and the innocence from which they came. The similarity to Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter can't be overlooked as well as the Puritan environment that bred rebellion from authority and repetition of parents' sins. Rest assured, these townspeople are guilty each one of something. Although deservedly nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign film, it is also nominated for cinematography, perhaps its strongest technique. The simple farms, clean and straight like Amish settlements, highlighted by pristine snow, are waiting to be violated or can withstand righteous assaults enough to destroy whole civilizations. The black and white monochrome assures we know this is good and evil country.Although White Ribbon is too long by a half hour, it is a satisfying tour of a landscape filled with malice, deceit, malevolence, and a bit of romance to remind us of the evil's roots and the rebirth and irony of white-ribboned innocence.",Null,2,5,10 February 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," DreamWorks can be proud.
","The President of the United States (Stephen Colbert): 'Boys, set the terror level at code brown, 'cause I need to change my pants.' Monsters vs. Aliens is my first 3-D movienot really, but it is the first time I have felt the process worked within a film as an integral part of the artistic process. It supports the science fiction, titillates at times, but most of all gives the illusion of reality. DreamWorks can be proud of this addition to the pantheon of excellent contemporary animations (dominated by Pixar) that use its Shrek as a touchstone for memorable characters wedded to mature themes and superior techniques.Monsters vs. Aliens is also a family film in the truest sense: Elders to tots can enjoy the visual delights of 3-D outer space and observe a young bride-to-be Susan Murphy (voice of Reese Witherspoon) grow by a radiation accident into the heroic role of Ginormica, a woman literally too big for her britches. She must assert her independence from a self-centered fiancé and convince family, friends, and the world that an out-sized woman (read overachieving feminist) has a place in the male world, a superior place at that.A strength of this sweet film is its use of ironic, sometimes sardonic, language to satirize just about everyone, from the president (see the opening quotation, not great humor but entertaining) to the makers of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whose feel good '70's glow is ripe for 21st-century cynicism, to memories of such chestnuts as The Blob and The Creature from the Black Lagoon.The hip,loving mood of the film is exemplified by the alien's proclamation at invasion time, 'Humans of Earth, my quest has led me to your planet. Give it to me now! You should, in no way, take any of this personally. It's just business.'",Null,73,120,22 March 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A memorable girl
","'What is hidden in snow, comes forth in the thaw.' Swedish proverbThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is indeed a girl's movie, for it is about misogyny and the revenge women can sometimes get. In between is a standard thriller, albeit classy and European, so there's much more investigation than shooting. It's an American product, based on the Swedish film of the same name in 2009, itself based on the Stieg Larsson novels about a wildly eccentric 23 year old woman, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who has the investigative skills of Sherlock Holmes and the prowess of La Femme Nikita.Daniel Craig plays a disgraced journalist, Mikael, engaged by a powerful family to answer one of its darkest secrets and at the same time get revenge on his courtroom antagonist, who caused his disgrace. He enjoins Lisbeth to help the investigation.With women the victims in both parts of the story, the investigations have parallel themes of revenge and feminism. Lisbeth is one of the most complicated women ever on screen. Alternately kinky and remote, tough and vulnerable, she also is ultra modern navigating both technology and sex.This iteration has all the plot points of the original and an enhancement of the relationship between journalist and assistant. In the end all is tied up, with an anticlimax that could have been left behind although it is interesting to see how the criminals receive their just rewards.Overall the film is stylish and decidedly brutal (a rape scene is shocking but still watchable) with a cerebral overlay complementing the base acts that include incest and Nazis just in case rape were not enough for the audiences on both sides of the pond. That the American version could so soon after the Swedish compel viewers and stand on its own is a tribute to director David Fincher and novelist Larsson.'Evil shall with evil be expelled.'

Dreamgirls," Enjoy!
","To compete at all with Moulin Rouge or Chicago, a musical in film must be robust and unique with actors beautiful and talented. Dreamgirls is a lively staging of the famous Broadway musical about three gifted girls who make it big with the help of a sometimes ruthless manager.Could be the Supremes or the Pips, but these actresses carry plenty of their own charisma, especially the American Idol graduate, Jennifer Hudson,as Effie, who belts gospel and pop with equal measures of lustiness and soul, a combination of Ella Fitzgerald and Barbra Streisand.For the male leads, Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) is a believable manager, but Eddie Murphy steals the show as aging pop star James 'Thunder' Early, slightly less manic than the late James Brown but maybe not less ruthless. Taylor morphs James Early and the Dreamettes from R&B into pop and the wealth that attends to the wider audience appeal. Although he changes the big-boned lead from Effie to the whiter,slimmer Deena (Beyonce), and marries Deena, the successful triumvirate struggles with their wealth and loss of the robust Effie, who suffers most of all.It's all the stuff of American popular glory and tragedy, but entertaining beyond the clichés and hyped-up show stopping songs such as 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,' 'One Night Only,' 'When I First Saw You,' and 'Cadillac Car.' It's glitz and superficiality with a heavy dose of melodrama, but it is as American as that Caddy. Enjoy.",Null,2,7,20 December 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Beyond just middle-aged dating.
","Being a virgin was best for Christ's mother, but losing virginity is a right of passage for most American males. For Steve Carell's Andy Stitzer it's a nightmare he has avoided for 40 years. He's a reluctant virgin traumatized by more than one aggressive girl in his youth, but his buddies think his time has come. Thus begins a tortuous journey to love and maturity for an electronics store salesman whose idea of a good time is making a perfect omelet or rearranging his perfectly stored action figures.I thought 'Must Love Dogs' with John Cusack and Diane Lane was the best romantic comedy of the summer, and more than I hoped for. But Virgin goes beyond just middle-aged dating; it explores the value of holding out for a higher level of meaning when engaging in sex;, and it satirizes the social norms that foster promiscuity. Ultimately it settles on the right mixture represented by Carell and his business neighbor, Catherine Keener's Trish.Along the way is some insightful writing, often delivered with understated irony, by Andy and his two buddies. For instance, those who haunt video stores for offbeat memories know immediately that when Andy is counseled to be tough like David Caruso in Jade, the writers are geeky and knowing. The setup in the waxing salon, with Carell actually having his chest hair torn off and bleeding, reminds me of the outtakes of Peter Sellers as Chauncey Gardner in 'Being There,' where he keeps trying to swear but ends up blowing the scene because he finds himself amusingly out of place. Andy swears at each rip of the adhesive, each time funnier than the last.This is my first experience with Steve Carell; I hope it won't be the last. The same can be said of first time director Judd Apatow. Both are not virgins when it comes to delivering sophisticated comedy.",Null,5,14,19 August 2005
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Top of the Summer Heap.
","'One day you're going to take it too far.' Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)So far, after five Mission Impossible film adaptations of the iconic TV program, Tom Cruise has not taken it too far. In fact, Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation is arguably the best of all, given its high humor and non-stop action set pieces that never disappoint. As formulaic as it basically is, it is still high-quality filmmaking. Credit inspired writer-director Christopher McQuarrie for guaranteeing his and the franchise's future.But, make no mistake about it, Tom Cruise as an unstoppable operative of IMF is the core of the success—he is as muscular and bright, athletic and ironic, as he has ever been. That look in his eye of knowingness and wariness is the perfection of smart and tough, a true cinematic hero. But then his cohorts are not shabby either, notably Simon Pegg as computer nerd Benji, with just the right loyalty and smarts for being in the service of brilliant buddy Ethan. Benji is also a pretty effective man in the field when not behind a desk.Jeremy Renner as second in command, William Brandt, is the appropriate realist to the optimistic Hunt. Above them all, however, is the bright Rebecca Ferguson as multiple agent Ilsa Faust. Given that much of the action takes place in Casablanca, it's not hard to figure the allusion of her first name. As for Faust, well, the allusion will make sense once you see the film. She does remind me of Ingrid Bergman, and I hope the franchise continues her role.A sequence at the Vienna State Opera House that syncs the music of Turandot to the spy action is as creative and smooth as any I have ever seen in a formulaic thriller. The homage to the Hitchcock The Man Who Knew Too Much is appreciated, just switching from Royal Albert Hall to Vienna.The stunts are choreographed with Alvin-Ailey precision and grace, and the Robert Elswit's cinematography is sublime. As for first-rate editing by Eddie Hamilton, the film could not fly so high without it. As for lovemaking, there is none, a singular achievement in American cinema.Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation is at the top of the summer thriller heap.",Null,0,1,3 August 2015
Collateral," Best buddy team of the year.
","Michael Mann successfully directed 'The Insider,' 'Manhunter,' and the 'Miami Vice' TV series. Tom Cruise's work in 'Magnolia, ' 'Minority Report,' and 'Vanilla Sky' shows his interest in stretching his acting experiences. Not surprisingly, then, their 'Collateral' can be placed next to 'Manchurian Candidate' and 'Bourne Supremacy' for best of the 2004 thriller race.'Collateral' is as slick and tricky as you'd expect from director Mann, whose Hannibal Lecter 'Manhunter,' with great acting by William Petersen and Brian Cox, is a classic of the serial-killer/disturbed cop genre. In 'Collateral' Mann has a special interest in character development with Cruise playing a gray-haired hired assassin and Jamie Foxx a hapless but humane LA cabbie forcibly hired to chauffeur Cruise on a string of hits over the course of one night. Cruise is cold and barely vulnerable as the night moves on; Foxx slowly learns how to grow from the ordeal, even finding potential love from a fare prior to Cruise. Unlikely as they may seem, the two are my nominees for best buddy team of the year, far and away smarter and more amusing than Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in 'Starsky and Hutch.'Part of the insightful screenplay by Stuart Beattie ('Pirates of the Caribbean') is the interplay that lets Cruise's Vincent helpfully assess Max's (Foxx) aspirations to run a limo business when he's been at the preparation for a futile dozen years. Similarly, Max leads Vincent into a discussion of life's meaning, specifically the insignificance of human lives, a topic of some interest to a hit man. The language is taut and minimalist, just right for an evening of clandestine contract murder. When Max comments about one of the hits, 'You just met him once and you killed him like that?' Vincent replies, 'What? I should only kill people after I get to know them.' The bard also made murder a literate topic when his Hamlet said, 'For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak/With most miraculous organ.' The film is not miraculous, but it speaks engagingly.One of the victims involves the two leads in a jazz club, where Vincent shows his considerable knowledge of the music and heartlessness for his victim. The sequence underscores Vincent's attraction to improvisation, which a night of mishaps brings into relief. Nice motif.Just as Sophia Coppola made Tokyo seem like a glittering rest home in 'Lost in Translation,' Mann transforms the noirish L.A. into a neon nirvana with aerial shots that soften the ragged, undistinguished architecture. The city never looked this good at night from a helicopter.No collateral damage to your brain to see this modern film noir.",Null,78,117,5 August 2004
Dunkirk," An elegantly-made war story for the whole family.
","'Wars are not won by evacuations.' Winston Churchill By that reasoning, no epic film should be made of the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk beach in May 1940. But this is at least the second rendering, giving wunderkind writer/director Christopher Nolan a chance to create depth for the evacuation of 330,000 troops during a curious lull in the German advance. Nolan has personalized the war even better than Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.Perhaps the Germans thought a few of their Luftwaffe could just pick the troops off 'like fish in a barrel,' thus having no need for Panzers or Nazi hordes. Well, they were wrong because about 800 private boats joined in the rescue, making the common man the hero in an otherwise soldier-dominated WWII. I would have liked to hear some of the German side (I can't remember when 'German' was even mentioned). Yet, Nolan prefers to leave the enemy unknown and therefore making it existentially more horrifying.As we've learned from Nolan's cinematic gymnastics, he can take time and switch it around as well as his virtuoso camera. He takes several points of view including three evacuating soldiers and the captain of a small vessel, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance). In the latter, Nolan is especially effective at revealing the characters of Dawson's son and best friend and the rescued, shell-shocked soldier (Cillian Murphy) in the confines of the small boat. As for the volunteer RAF pilot, Ferrier (Tom Hardy), his cockpit contains all the action of an IMAX geographical documentary and textbook treatment of heroism and claustrophobia.Where Nolan does not impress is his choice to restrict context so that young persons may not even have an idea this is WWII unless they carefully read the opening titles. By minimizing the dramatic action, Nolan also creates an un-epic story by restricting the context. A more satisfactory drama would be a distributed exposition through dialogue with commanders and politicians as well as the grunts.The romantic Spitfire dog fights with Farrier, a skilled pilot, are just that—imaginative battle scenes that help give some epic moments. However, the sweep I would have liked came in Churchill's response to the evacuation: 'We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.'",Null,2,13,19 July 2017
The Machinist," The payoff is not half a good as the promise the premise makes
","'The Machinist is one of those classic stories in which a man goes out on a quest to solve a troubling mystery that ultimately leads right back to himself,' says director Brad Anderson. Mix Memento and Insomnia with The Tenant and The American Friend and you will have some notion of a dark brew of a film that has more calories than nutrition, whose payoff is not half a good as the promise the premise makes.Trevor (Christian Bale) is a gaunt (Bale lost 60 pounds, down to 121), sleepless machinist whose life is unraveling even faster after his inadvertent responsibility for an industrial accident. Because he hasn't slept in a year and his refrigerator oozes blood, it's fairly certain his mind is on its own trip. As the story progresses, he becomes more disoriented while the film slips from extreme psychodrama to middling thriller and then relatively nothing in the end.Bale's publicity for losing the pounds (the women in the film tell him, ''If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist'') can be compared to De Nero's gain For Raging Bull and CharlizeTheron's makeover for Monster, but in Bale's case not a positive since his role is not as rich as the other two's.The women in the story have been given the memorable roles: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the hooker girlfriend, Stevie, has perfected the heart of gold thing; Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) a late-night waitress, is a naturally sympathetic beauty who takes a shine to him: 'You're lonely,' she tells Trevor. 'When you work graveyard shift as long as I have, you get to know the type.' We do get to know his type of psychotic from films, but only his demons (There's a fun house named Route 666!) have any real interest. He remains for me only a malnourished neurotic with guilt to satisfy the most demanding Catholic bishop.'If you were any thinner,' Stevie tells him, 'you wouldn't exist.'

The Intouchables," Best Bromance in Years
","'I don't empty a stranger's butt.' Driss (Omar Sy)But he will, and you'll not see a comedy this year on either side of the pond than The Intouchables. Or a better treatment of disability, without pity and filled with humanity. Or a better buddy story than this one about quadriplegic Phillipe (Francois Cluzet) and his aide, Driss (Omar Sy).It's a bromance without sex, a hands-across-the-social-divide that avoids clichés but still gives anticipated humorous setups a new vigor.Expecting tears and pity, I found laughter and love as Driss, a poor black man with a very big heart and personality, is hired by wealthy entrepreneur Phillipe to tend him. Although the eventual reinvigoration of daredevil Phillipe under the exuberant if rough Driss is to be expected with this formula, the wholesome affection and lack of pity are infectious.Intouchables has numerous moments of hilarity and humanity such as when the two men speed down the highway almost hoping for police who will fulfill Driss's prediction that the two end up with an escort. Both men are speed freaks; both men are happy to indulge that passion.Another mirthful moment is Driss's reaction to his first opera. Opera lovers will especially like his unaffected amazement and amusement that this is how the rich spend their time. Sy is so good as Driss that even I would enjoy his spontaneous disruption of a serious operatic production.Buried in the joyful surface is the subject of class differences. Driss comes from living with several cousins in a small apartment, may have been a druggie and a dealer, and avoids work. Phillipe is a wealthy entrepreneur who went too high on a para sail to fulfill his danger lust. Beyond a small fee Phillipe wrangles from a friend for Driss's painting, Driss gets no other improvement in his living situation and Phillipe deteriorates while he makes a tough decision about Driss.It's not difficult to see why the film has been seen by over 300 million people so far and just begun to flourish in the US.",Null,1,2,15 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," `There's magic in the web of it.'
","Like most human beings, 13-year-old Harry Potter is becoming plain interesting as he gets older.  The newest installment, `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' is a testimony to testosterone and tribulation as Harry, Hermione, and Ron meet the threat of mass murderer Sirus Black, who, upon escaping Azkaban Prison, seriously wants to find Harry.  Even the hundreds of Dementors sent to protect Hogwarts from Black are more trouble than they are worth.What makes Harry and buds more interesting than ever is that they care more deeply about each other and take more time to figure out their strategies, the way intelligent adults do.  The use of time travel to set things right is not just a plot device but more a way of showing the importance of each decision along the way of life, a kind of existential anguish for teens, who even in normal times have enough trouble defining themselves by the choices they make. The wickedly intelligent Hermione emerges as more than a just a smart-ass girl in a male dominated school: She's pivotal in focusing Harry on the task at hand and even punches out a nasty boy.  Romance has not even been hinted at; friendship, loyalty, and love of the purest kind are foremost for these adventurers.  Gone is Director Chris Columbus's phallic imagery and quick cuts for `Chamber of Secrets'; in is Director Alfonso Cuarón's (`Y tu Mama Tambien') more delicate pubescent parable, like the need to know oneself and one's parents.The special effects are as smoothly integrated as ever-the first sequence of a magic triple-decker bus carrying and careening Harry through London to `The Leaky Cauldron' is funny and harrowing, like the rest of the story. The twisted, animated tree continues to hold multiple secrets while it flings leaves and people at will.  But in the end, it's the people like Dumbledore and the Dark Arts teacher who provide the excitement for a young man now relying more on his wits than on magic to get him through. 
At the beginning of `Prisoner of Azkaban,' when Harry `blows up' his abusive aunt, he knows the action is extreme and maybe not exactly what he wanted, but his emerging adult nature sees the justice due (`She got what she deserved'), and he won't undo it. Welcome to responsibility for your actions, Harry. Adult life may be filled with terrifying enemies-you just have to deal with them as fairly and smartly as possible.

Ratatouille," Out the window . . .
","Food, family, creativity, criticism, racism, romance: If these themes satisfy your critical standards for a superior film, then Ratatouille should qualify as one of your favorite films of the year.Pixar and director Brad Bird, who defined family entertainment with The Incredibles, have another human comedy animation hit on their hands, and the foodies have to love it. Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt), a rat in a French restaurant, helps a hapless lad named Linguini become the five-star restaurant's star chef.The rat is a rodent realistically realized, homely by contrast with those more pleasant looking in Flushed Away. The human faces of the non-rats are by far the best renditions of reality I have seen in hyper-humanized computer graphics. The restaurant kitchen is so real I wanted to cut onions and crush garlic. But the piece de resistance is Anton Ego, the food critic, as trenchant a criticism of us self-centered, aloof critics as will ever appear on screen.The voice of Peter O'Toole makes his demeanor even more insipid and scary, his words heavy with moralizing: 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.' I was humbled and exalted at the same time. Art for art's sake, I say.Bertolt Brecht said, 'Food first, then morality.' Well, throw out the moralizing platitudes and eat. Food is the music of Ratatouille, nourishment for all the adults of the family and a primer on kitchens for kids who think good food comes out of a window and through the car window.",Null,2,3,4 July 2007
Bad Teacher," An Average Grade
","Bad teacher is not a bad movie; it's just like most teachers we've known—average—just surviving. And so, Cameron Diaz's Elizabeth Halsey has one goal: to find a man to take care of her, a difficult task in a middle school where the richest teacher turns out to be too weird to take seriously. The gym teacher: too poor.On the way to her survival, she takes drugs, seduces, steals, and cheats—just generally a bad teacher who nonetheless gets asked back. Not a totally unusual situation for those of us who have been around education for a while and seen a rogue teacher or two or three. Or those of us who enjoyed Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa, in which his 'bad' becomes the litmus test. Bad Teacher is a weak cousin for its lack of bite and Billy Bob's charming maliciousness.What's interesting about Elizabeth is that she's not very likable; she's just a hard case doing her wicked best. In fact, she has enough moxie to make her more interesting than just about any other colleague, administrators included. The antics she pulls like smoking pot in her car or giving a boy student her bra are indefensible and would lead to most teachers' dismissal, but for the purposes of fiction and comedy, she gets a kind of audience tenure.Then, too, if I had a teacher who looked like that, I might have learned something, anything, just to keep her around. What we finally learn is that looks count and good guys finish last. Lessons learned.",Null,5,11,24 June 2011
Now You See Me," A bit of summer magic
","'First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room.' J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) In the case of the magical little entertainment called Now You See Me, you don't have to be the smartest person in the audience to be charmed by the illogical 'magic' of the tricks or the script. In a takeoff of traditional heist films and homage to recent films like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and The Prestige, with a smattering of smart, sometimes humorous chatter, this film moves at rapid pace (French director Louis Leterrier knows how from his Transporter films) with a lack of seriousness about the tricks, which are mostly explained as the film moves on.Those revelations will bother purists who don't want to know the secrets or critics who demand a reasonable arc for the story. Like the magic itself, the film eventually captures the imagination enough to suspend disbelief and just go with the fun.The 'four horsemen' (Atlas, played by Eisenberg; Merritt by Woody Harrelson; Henley by Isla Fisher; and Jack by Dave Franco) create three successive magic shows, one in Las Vegas, a second in New Orleans, and the third in New York. The stakes rise incrementally as they appear to be playing Robin Hood to their large, American-Idol type audiences by showering them with money from their magical heists. The FBI with Agent Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) is in hot but bungling pursuit.As in most thrillers, there are minor twists, and the final one that stretches credulity, or that some will see coming, along with a hopper full of smaller ones even naïve I could see from far off. Besides, like the Oceans films' heists, it's not about the heist or the magic. It's about the slick magicians, their easy banter, and comeuppance for the real baddies.Outrageous set pieces like the car race will disconcert those looking for a tightly-told narrative. The magic is as always questionable because film deals in magic with practically every frame. However, the cast is delightfully comic, the direction speedy and tricky, and the entire film wants you in on the magic. For a summer film, that's a magic formula.",Null,4,6,31 May 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Terrific blockbusting beginning of summer
","'So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?' Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)It's not set if you can, like Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), go 50 years back into 1973 and stop the creation of the Sentinels, Terminator- like robot warriors created by scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), whose robots always defeat the mutants: 'From the beginning, the Sentinels were targeting the X-Men. Then they began targeting everyone.' (Wolverine)So the plot of the exciting X-Men: Days of Future Past begins. The use of mutants in the Vietnam War, and the war itself, serve as a conflict backdrop to show the path to annihilation begun even without the help of Sentinels. This iteration of a Marvel Comics hero collective is more complex and philosophical than its predecessors with new characters (mostly young versions of the X-men and women) that lend variety and interest and a measure of actor charisma. Besides the usual sturm and drang of robot arms like Gatling guns with eyes like beacons, this film has heart and humor as mutants and their leaders, Professor Xavier and his nemesis- now-bud, Magneto (Ian Mckellen), convene to send Logan back to convince their younger selves (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender) to save surviving humans and sometimes to deal with misunderstood loves and friendships.When director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg open with a moving shot of downtrodden mutants and sympathizers marching in unison, Fritz Lang's silent-movie Metropolis immediately comes to mind, and it evokes the theme of the oppressed waiting to rise up against the ruling class. Holocaust-like images of mutants and their sympathizers herded for internment camps chillingly reveal a doomed New York City.The mutants are, after all, different, and in current conservative thinking, enemies of the good American life, lily white that is. As the various outliers, including the X-Men, fight for equality and against suppression, Hollywood again does a credible job of mixing imaginative action with contemporary lives of the disadvantaged.Our heroes struggling with a vendetta-prone Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) adds interest to the usual survival motifs. She kicks butt with the best of them while she carries through her plan that actually dooms humans and mutants even more.The cast is terrific, even if the story goes on too long, as the film moves thrillingly from a sober beginning: 'Mutants, we now find ourselves on the edge of extinction....' Professor Xavier",Null,1,4,24 May 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," It's charming and fantastic but no Potter.
","'You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander. Just like your suitcase, I think there's more to you than meets the eye. Kicked out of Hogwarts for endangering human life with a beast, yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion. I wonder... what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you, Mr. Scamander?' Percival Graves (Colin Farrell)Graves' (The chief of security for the wizard world) comment in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them suggests the homoerotic subtext of Harry Potter and sums up the fantastic elements of this Harry Potter prequel (70 years): Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), magizoologist and shy scientist, carries a suitcase of strange animals that also serves as a portal escape hatch. His job is to protect these little ones as he says from 'the most vicious creatures on the planet, humans.' In 1926 prohibition NYC, he searches for lost beasties and new species and encounters the covert magician population and various human beasts as well. His brown luggage bag is filled with these little creatures, including an adorable green twig, Bowtruckle. Yet, the most lovable, Niffler (a mole with a duck's bill), has escaped on search for shiny objects to fill his kangaroo-like pouch.Let's settle this for me right now: veteran Potter director David Yates' Fantastic Beasts is no Harry Potter—it lacks the depth of characterization and the intricacy of the Hogwarts world. It still, however, has the zany fun with exotic wizards and varied No-Majs (American Muggles) like the sweet, bungling baker, Jacob (Dan Fogler), who bring us back to J.K. Rowling's Potter-like world. Actually, I find eccentric and crazy characters boring after a while; I nodded off a slight bit, especially when Eddie Redmayne's British accent is garbled or when just too many lightning wands, explosions, and strange animals overpower the narrative. Redmayne's Newt is also too cute with his patented bashfulness, stammer, head held down, and hardly talking.I am not sure young kids will be able to keep up with the plot, so have them read the titular text book beforehand so they don't fall asleep. 'I don't think I'm dreaming and I ain't got the brains to make this up,' says Jacob. Keep your brains awake for this twisty, Potter prequel and you will be rewarded with beaucoup beasts and a few of the human kind.",Null,8,18,17 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," It's a scary one, but no surprise because it has a nun doing the heavy lifting.
","'This is as close to hell as I ever want to get.' Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) When a thriller-horror story is also a love story, I know I'm in the land of the Catholic Church, nuns, Christ, sin, and redemption. As for the love part of Conjuring 2, well, Lorraine and Ed Warren (Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) are famous paranormal investigators/demonologists (in real life, too) who happen to be married with a love that helps them through another demonic possession story.After the real Amityville Horror and after The Conjuring, they are drawn again to similar shenanigans in North London. Now, even after the long break, they are back helping an Enfield family in demonic distress. The scene is not your usual rickety old Victorian mansion but rather a rickety old council flat. Together with director James Wan's expert tracking shots, this film knows just how to scare the hell out of the audience.This case is about holding on to the one you loveâ€”the single-mom Peggy Hogson (Francis O'Connor) family hangs on to each other after dad has abandoned them while they are disturbed by the ghost of a 'crooked' old man who wants them to leave his home. When all else fails the family, love brings them through, and in a sense so too does the old man's love of his family keep him in this world, even though he died years ago.As for the Catholic/Christian overlay, the demon is dressed like a Goth nun, and a priest is consulted because the Church is renowned for its ability to exorcise (see The Exorcist from 43 years ago). As a former fallen-down Catholic boy, I can attest to the power of the nuns to direct our consciences, indeed our very inner spirits, away from sin, especially of the flesh. The downside is that we can fiercely fear the devil wearing a habit. In the end, God or his son on a little crucifix around Ed's neck will save the faithful.You'd think in the Thatcher era, a demon in her outfit would be enough to scare a poor British family, but the Catholic Church works a better scare in habits because of its ambivalent role in many lives, savior and Satan",Null,0,2,10 June 2016
Jackie," Great historical drama, Great performance.
","'We're just the beautiful people.' Robert Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard)Although the Kennedys were indeed that, Bobby has caught the spirit of director Pablo Larrain and writer Noah Oppenheim's close-to-perfect biodrama of Jacqueline Kennedy in Jackie, set during the week after her husband's assassination. This evocation of a relatively-recent catastrophe for the American people catches the irony of 'beautiful people' caught in the cross hairs of a careless and malevolent populace that rebels against too much beauty in the hands of the few.So finely tuned is this meticulous history that while she smokes during a reporter's (Billy Crudup) interview, she tells him, 'I don't smoke.' The smoke and mirrors of 'Camelot' are carefully tended to by the former first lady, maybe the first first lady to understand the power of image and the portal, television, for making that legacy immortal.Jackie is a serious exploration of a widow's grief and her understanding of her role in history, despite any misgivings she has about myths that were already forming about her husband and that she was enhancing by playing a regal role in front of millions, a girl who doesn't like crowds. Mrs. Kennedy presented her world to the world through an early TV trek through the changes she had made in the White House décor. Although her husband disliked the expenditure, she knew the show would be a way of establishing the kingdom she would tend even after his death.To see Natalie Portman become Jackie with the strange accent and debutante's poise is to see an understated tour de force of acting, worthy of the role for which she has won an Oscar nomination. She remains poised, even right after the murder, not with her seeming self-serving but rather intimations of the immortality she can foster in front of the world.The film, surprisingly candid with the principals' discussion of Kennedy's meager contributions during his two years' tenure, shows how gradually a woman of exceptional intelligence and beauty can become an historical treasure as she assures her husband of the same legacy.",Null,3,6,26 January 2017
Tropic Thunder," A Summer Breeze
","Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.): 'I know who I am! I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude!' Finally this summer, a chance to belly laugh at the super-hero syndrome. Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder satirizes just about every self-absorbed actor who has ever played a hero, including Robert Downey, Jr., this summer's Iron Man, playing a five Oscar winner dying his face to look like a black man and acting all the clichés. His comment above synthesizes this film's irreverent attitude toward an entire industry of phonies and narcissists.While making the war picture to end all war pictures, a movie production is lost in the jungle, only to find themselves in real combat with narco-terrorists. The crew includes some over-the-hill heroes such as Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), a Sylvester Stallone knockoff, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), a parody of his fat/farting self, and Lazarus. At home, Tom Cruise does an impressive take on a balding, bloated financier, who could be a type of Sumner Redstone, Cruise's nemesis in real life. Matthew McConaughey as Rick Peck, Speedman's faithful agent, also plays the laughs and satire just right.The current flack over the film's treatment of mentally challenged people is not without merit'You never go full retard'but loses thrust when you consider most of the movie makes fun of most everybody. Criticism could be leveled at performances that garble words, such as Downey's when he tries to mimic stereotypical Black dialogue patterns. Too much of the film's dialogue is lost in the frenzy of blasting and blathering.Last year's Wild Hogs came at the right time in the summer; Stiller's titillating Tropic Thunder is a summer breeze of laughs, base humor, and biting satire of an industry that can make money making fun of itself.",Null,3,8,13 August 2008

Inside Out," Pixar genius
","'Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.' Samuel Ullman While the emotions of a pre-adolescent girl, Riley (voice of Kaitlyn Dias), in Inside Out are depicted in a Star-Trek like control room as real characters, Joy (Amy Poehler) is the Captain Kirk, the major influence in Riley's life so far and at the helm with other players Fear, Sadness, Disgust, and a plethora of memory pods. Riley's had a happy Minnesota life so far with ice hockey and hiking and a much simpler life than now faces her in the family's move to San Francisco.The depiction of these raucous emotions is sheer Pixar genius, a human menagerie of inner players, making sense of the conflicting feelings of a young person, and all of us for that matter. The visuals are stunning, as colorful as has been seen in any other animation, and the big-eyed 'toon characters have distinct personalities developed in a short time.Besides the anthropomorphic emoticons, I am most impressed by the emphasis on memory in fashioning a life. My fear is losing that great gift, for memories form the core of satisfaction with my life, a hedge against mortality if you will. Inside Out emphasizes the primacy of those memories while it also frames the inside fight around the necessity for the conflicting emotions, even sadness as a major player in mental health.Well, it is Pixar after all with its brilliant combination of fun and intelligence, a work of art that indulges the physical and cerebral. All this in an animation—who would have thought except that Saturday cartoons at my local theater helped me shape a loving attitude toward cinema and a career in film criticism?

","'We were driving through Colorado, we had the radio on, and eight of the Top 10 songs were Beatles songs...'I Wanna Hold Your Hand,' all those early ones. They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid... I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.'-Bob DylanIf the works of Shakespeare were suddenly erased from the world's memory, culture would suffer an unthinkable loss. In Danny Boyle's witty and entertaining Yesterday, the works of the Beatles have been lost in a freak 12 sec global electrical outage. Except for Jack (Hamish Patel), who remembers the music and proceeds to reintroduce it as his own.Boyle and writer Richard Curtis, who seem to know a thing or two about music and struggle, have a winner of a conceit in the world discovering arguably the greatest composers of pop music in history. Patel interprets the songs beautifully and simply with a stripped-down guitar that enhances the lyrics and melodies.We have been graced this year with two outstanding musical biopics, Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman (although the latter is surely more fantasy than bio), and Yesterday is a fitting companion piece to those stellar movies. The Beatles come alive through the songs, interpreted with low-key power by Patel.Yesterday disappointed with its reliance on the old trope of boyhood friend Ellie (Lily James), then manager, having unrequited love for Jack. You know how that will end, taking considerable surprise away from an otherwise intriguing premise.Then the matter of the ethics of plagiarizing; not until the end is Jack faced with the moral dilemma when so much effective drama could have been experienced much before then. Anyhow, hearing the simplified Beatles should bring tears to your eyes (It did to mine) with a deep appreciation of transcendent pop music.Yesterday is about today and forever.",Null,6,16,1 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," One of the best superhero blockbusters ever.
","'It's not about how much we lost. It's about how much we have left. We're the Avengers. We gotta finish this.' Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.)Don't believe for a minute that Marvel's Comic Universe is finished after Avengers: Endgame. It may be curtains for archenemy Thanos (Josh Brolin), but a multibillion-dollar MCU franchise has much yet to accomplish. In Endgame, playing with time like a time machine allows the heroes a chance to reverse the 'inevitable' work of their nemesis to save the world.The more important time motif here is the three hours of viewing, from which no time machine can spare us. Yet, the genius of the directors Russo and their writers is to make the time go in warp speed, filling the screen with engaging characters and their actors, witty lines not forcing sarcasm but dishing soft irony. The visuals are equally almost underplayed so that it's an organic whole with no element, even music, dominating.
What does dominate is the abiding humanity where love and hate, empire and home, and collaboration not individualism are evidenced in fleshed-out characters and universal themes carefully but never overpoweringly used. The motif of people working as a team for the communal good underlies heroic actions while searching for home and family is the motivating sympathy binding almost all the major characters.The honor roll includes Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), and Captain America (Chris Evans). And too many more to list, the point being these actors have become the heroes; kudos to successful casting directors.Although I must allow the usual tropes to bind us in sci-fi sympathy, I will always complain that the final act has too many explosions and fist fights (really, with the super tech available to these star travelers, why must the ultimate decider be old-fashioned brute force?). Despite that complaint, I find the movie thrillingly entertaining, a great example for the uninitiated into the genre. I must say there are fewer explosions in the first two acts than usual. Hooray.For those of us who have seen much sci-fi, Avengers: Endgame has just about all the best qualities we have seen and loved.

Quantum of Solace," Not the balm . . .
","'Till that a capable and wide revenge/Swallow them up.' OthelloRevenge suits James Bond as well as anyone, largely because he's uniquely capable of carrying it through to its final solution, be it blood or blarney. Quantum of Solace spends its time racing and blasting to the exclusion of rich verbal moments that Daniel Craig is capable of delivering with the best of Brit actors. But here his lines are minimal, the effects standard with no gadgets, and the girls not as cheaply attractive as golden ones of the past.Craig as Bond is impressivelaconic, physically fit, cocky, and emotionally invulnerable except for his loss of his love, Vesper (Eva Green), from Casino Royale. During the moments he duels with his boss, M (Judy Dench), I wanted to stay there for the whole film, dynamite, roaring cars, and fires be damned. The acting chops between those two are formidable, cheapening the leer of villain Dominic Greene too gently played by Mathieu Amalric (Munich), and the flat affect of his leading actress Olga Kurylenko as Camille. Oh, yes, when Quantum of Solace is not about revenge, it is all about fighting for the riches of the desert, and not the ones you usually think of. The cinematography is top-rate if not frenetic beyond even American taste, and the chases on land and sea and air are all of the same cloth: Bond resolves them with the same deft turn of the wheel that leads his pursuers to a wall of sorts each time. Quantum has no gadgets, few quips, and unremarkable women; in other words it veers from the canon of light-hearted fantasies to hard-core violence and angst. As we approach the second Depression within some memories, it would be good for the producing Broccoli family to remember how the franchise has helped us forget national and global calamities by employing less psychology and more irony. This revenge business is not the balm to bring us back:M: I thought I could trust you. You said you weren't motivated by revenge. James Bond: I am motivated by my duty. M: I think you're so blinded by inconsolable rage that you don't care who you hurt. When you can't tell your friends from your enemies, it's time to go. James Bond: You don't have to worry about me.",Null,1,3,14 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," One of the best of the year.
","A time when drug deals come with multiple murders and amoral operatives is no time for aging West Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) to stay on the job, especially since Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is determined to retrieve the dollars from amateur but crafty Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin). No Country for Old Men, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel by the Coen brothers, is a classic explanation of a title, where the plot is perfectly in synch with the titular expectations. In fact, this film is one of the best modern westerns ever and even at this late time of the year, closing in on Oscar, one of the best of the year.Because the Coens are notorious for ingeniously wringing out humor in dark films (Think the washed out Fargo, the pregnant cop, the Minnesota accents), no one will be disappointed at the laughs emerging from the clipped, minimalist speech of Texans who wouldn't acknowledge Mr. Death if he were handing them a calling card. For example, when Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) is asked how dangerous Anton is, he replies, 'Compared to what? The bubonic plague?' The Coens catch the slow, indifferent drawls and irritation at strangers who don't get it. But in most cases, Anton Chigurh is in no mood to indulge these rubes and disposes of them as one might shoo flies from a hot border cafe. (Sometimes he engages his victims in a simple existential conversation concerning fate and personal responsibility.)The pace is slow enough for Jones to do his best acting ever, with Brolin a stunning Nick Nolte imitation. But the slow, assured menace of Bardem dominates No Country, like the arid, deathly plains of New Mexico cinematographer Roger Deakins nails perfectly as metaphor. Add this modern Western to this year's excellent westerns 3:10 to Yuma and Assassination of Jesse James, and you have as satisfactory a genre year as ever since Unforgiven. Much will be made of the Hitchcockean pacing and inscrutable ending. Granted, but these facets are just a signal that the Coens are back borrowing and puzzling as never before with a film that stands proudly beside Arizona and Fargo.",Null,4,14,8 November 2007
District 9," An original
","To delight this critic with sci-fi, you need a heavy dose of allegory, jaw breaking production values, developing characters, ingenious plot, and eye-easing cinematography. The Peter Jackson produced District 9 pretty much has all these except for the last. If it weren't for the disorienting, jittery, hand-held cameras, the film would be an almost perfect modern sci fi. And I hold a respect for the genre from Metropolis through Forbidden Planet down to 28 Days Later. So this film is within the district.Aliens have landed in Johannesburg, South Africa. For twenty years they have been held in compound District 9, but the natives are restless to get the ugly 'prawns' out of their 'hood. Such a plan to move over a million aliens to a holding camp is given to unlikely leader Wikus (Sharlto Copley), whose challenges as the lead organizer are almost insurmountable. Just think of occupying Iraq or apartheid, and you'll get the idea.Wikus becomes almost the entire focus of the film, and in that sense he embodies all of those residents who fear outsiders, but who discover deep wells of understanding inside themselves as to who the real enemies are. In Wikus's case, alien Chris Johnson becomes a 'Christ' in the allegorical tradition, but just barely. Actually the parallel themes to our time are ample besides that biblical chestnut.That Wikus develops as a character is a saving grace of the film because the alien-virus-contracting hero struggles with the ambitious Jo'Burgers such as his father-in-law who want to harvest his organs to gain the power the aliens have but no one else can use because of their special DNA. Imaginative District 9 is; bloodless and visually stable it is not.While District 9 has obvious reference to this summer's blockbusting Transformers in its alien attack machine, it is smarter and scarier. See it, but don't eat through it—it's gory. Although directed by Neill Blomkamp from his short story and film, Peter Jackson's sweeping vision of cinema as a visceral extension of the audience's dreams dominates. And that's good.",Null,6,17,10 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," One of the best this century.
","'You want to be like me, or you want to be me?' Jesse James to Robert Ford The very long arc of Jesse James's mythic persona has yet to descend, and this 2 hour 40 minute version of his demise, lengthily called The Assassination of Jesse James by that Coward Robert Ford, seems as slow until you remember that verisimilitude takes timethe small details of a life lived very large, represented in finite time on a finite screen. So I slipped into non-action mode, a singularly un-American posture, and enjoyed the little details of this notorious bandit's life writ large on the screen by a mighty contemporary myth producing and playing the titular role, Brad Pitt.The air is authenticity, an unhurried excursion through the faces and fates of the low lives the James brothers hired for their last train heist in 1881 in the titles sequence and then the quotidian incidents in James's life with Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) before he kills James. There are small moments to remind of McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Days of Heaven, but few to replicate the energy of the recent 3:10 to Yuma.However, Assassination has its place, like the equally long Dances with Wolves, in creating an authentic atmosphere while still perpetuating the romance of the West that figuratively speaks to our collective desire for individualism, peppered with the exhilaration of Westward movement and the realities of violence and exploitation. (But if that last statement reads pompous to you and you're turning to Long Riders for the twentieth time, then see Assassination just for political assassin James Carville's cameo as a pompous governor.) When Jesse James berates Ford with the statement, 'You want to be like me or you want to be me?' he is commenting on the contemporary cult of celebrity as it plays out in the film. When Frank James (Sam Shepard) advises Ford about his ability to be an outlaw, 'You don't have the ingredients, Son,' he is implying the hardscrabble life Jesse really had, memorably portrayed in one of the best westerns this century.",Null,3,6,16 October 2007
Toy Story 4," I hope this franchise never ends. Brilliant!
","'I was made to help a child, I don't remember it being this hard.' Woody (Tom Hanks voice)Joy, sorrow, laughter, tears, love, and loyalty-those words may describe Casablanca, but right now I'm thinking Toy Story 4. Who would have thought an animation could compete with that classic romance? Who would have thought one animated frame could show more humanity than those in all the summer blockbusters? Who would have thought after the triumph of 3 that 4 would be just as good?Pixar and director John Cooley (a Pixar operative with his directorial debut), together with writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom, have crafted yet another brilliant story of little people overcoming the crush of cretinous big people to save their pleasant roles as support for kids and strengthen their bonds as buddies. No better example than cowboy Woody and astronaut Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), whose initial Toy Story 1 dislike for each other has grown to a lively mature friendship three iterations later.Woody's growth is the heart of an uproarious adventure with the lovely Bo Peep (Annie Potts), who is the best strong female to occupy the screen in a long time. The two are sweet on each other but subsume that affection to the tasks of saving kids and toys from disconnection.Moreover, they have to deal with a new character, Forky (Tony Hale), a beautiful piece of trash with pipe-stem arms and disproportionate eyes, who forces friendship decisions and affections that help determine the maturity of lead characters. In addition, the carnival setting with a carousel and second-hand antique shop among other props helps to mix the joy of toydom and the danger of a rambunctious world without rules.And so it goes, turning not so much this time on finding home as finding love. Every family member should fully appreciate the humanity of that arc and listen to its abundant life lessons..You know Avenger's: Endgame is a change agent for a successful franchise.

Twilight," Enjoyably overcooked
","Isabella Swan: (to Edward) 'I know what you are. You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale white, and ice cold.'And a vampire. That piece of information is not a spoiler because almost every teenage girl knows the impossibly popular Twilight novel series by Stephanie Meyer is about 17-year-old Isabella Swan's love for 17-year-old Edward Cullen, a very handsome vampire. Oh, the longing. I forgot the teenage angst that feeds off a benign, unfulfilled lust for the opposite sex, whom the nuns made us fear as if girls were vampires. Twilight does as well as any film could in figuratively embodying the Romeo-and-Juliet-like difficulties of connecting temporarily, for a lifetime, or for eternity as is the case of the heroes in this enjoyable if emotionally overcooked romance.Somewhere in the delightful plot possibilities of a Washington state town called Forks, near Port Angeles, is an interesting family of mild-mannered vampires with some intriguing story possibilities, even some laughs. After all, the figurative living dead have always peopled our offices and audiences, so why not the real thing? It's only when director Catherine Hardwicke lingers over the hero and heroine with their painful stares of desire that you may wish for some stock vampire stuff to relieve the tedium. In fact, I am beginning to long myself for the hammy other Bella, Lugosi that is, as Dracula (1931), or Max Schreck's visually- haunting Nosferatu (1929), to satisfy my yearning for outright scary bloodsucking. The movement to defang, so to speak, some of our most enduring genres (James Bond, Spiderman, and Batman come to mind in the superhero category) by getting deeper into brooding, realistic characterization is taking away the conventional titillations such as fangs and frilly femmes in vampire movies and gadgets and sleazy ladies in the Bond franchise.In other words, sometimes I like cheesy, and Twilight is not that enough. What it does well is take a cloudy, forbidding Washington and make it romantic through the magic of aerial photography and true romance, albeit it of the adolescent type. The film advances the accepted interpretation of vampirism as unbridled lust and civilizes it to where desire can be seen as just another controllable emotion, not a life-threatening obsession. Hardwicke successfully navigates teens' brooding emotions.'One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach. All the damn vampires.' Last line of The Lost Boys.",Null,3,10,21 November 2008
Blue Crush," It relies less than I anticipated on the physical attributes of the young women and much more on the challenges of becoming good at something other than `looking good.'
","Could teen flick `Blue Crush' actually crush `Divine Secrets of the YA YA Sisterhood' by saying more about the need of young women to strike out on their own? Yes, a surfing movie with some weight easily glides over the lame `Ya Ya.'John Stockwell, who directed the estimable `crazy/beautiful' last summer with Kirsten Dunst, once again shows a teenage girl as a developing adult when she could have been just an attractive blonde with only guys on her mind. Of course, both of his films have hunks, in this case an NFL quarterback, and, yes, the leads fall for them, but Stockwell never forgets the girls' basic goodness and their ability to work out their problems and dreams as many of our worthy daughters have had to do in their real lives.The surfing sequences are impressive photographic gymnastics-you do feel you are piping with her as she glides inside the tube of a giant wave, although much of the time it is obviously not lead actress Kate Bosworth (the athletic equestrian from `The Horse Whisperer') negotiating that breaker. The reality of young girls working as housemaids to support their sport, including cleaning up vomit and condoms in rooms occupied by indelicate and wealthy men, is an authentic part of not just another Gidget doing beach-blanket bingo.While this film has not much of the gritty adolescent angst of Stockwell's `crazy/beautiful,' it relies less than I anticipated on the physical attributes of the young women and much more on the challenges of becoming good at something other than `looking good.'",Null,0,0,14 August 2002
To Rome With Love," Paris is better.
","'If you stop a hundred Romans, they'll tell you: I could give you a million stories.' Woody Allen's production notes Rome has always been more hectic and less romantic than Paris to me but with equally competing foods and women. Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is more romantic and humorous than To Rome with Love. The latter is flat by comparison, a picture post card of four vignettes rather than a short story with heft. After all, he opens it with Volare, hardly his usually sophisticated jazz and much too pop for a mature director/writer.Although I loved seeing Woody as a retired, avant-garde producer of operas, grousing in his usual way about the world's annoyances such as airline discomfort, the rest of the story, which involves instances of Seventh Commandment violations along with the illusions of celebrity, is generally dull and will be unprofitable for the Woodman: 'You're famous for being famous' is one person's answer to why the negligible Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) is besieged by reporters. It's Woody's weak interpretation of a major theme. Oh, well.With a writing Oscar for Midnight, Woody should have had better dialogue. Not to be. Yet even setups like the mortician who can sing glorious opera only when he is in the shower lead Woody to opera scenes that bore after the first splash of shower (the allusion to Woody's own successful staging of Puccini's Gianni Schicchi makes this sequence even more painful by contrast).A minor delight is Alec Baldwin as John, an architect, who acts as a Greek chorus for a young Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) about to compromise his relationship with Sally (Greta Gerwig) for her friend, Monica (Ellen Page). John's ironic admonitions about Jack's foolishness (heard and seen at times by only Jack—think Bogart in Play It Again, Sam) are spot-on, e.g., calling Monica 'a self-absorbed pseudo-intellectual.' Not enough Baldwin, however, to save the film.After all the infidelity the Eternal City induces on visitors and locals alike, the film becomes just postcards of famous places like the Trevi Fountain and The Spanish Steps, places that become a cliché like this film.",Null,1,11,28 June 2012
Bridesmaids," A leap forward
","'Bridesmaids are like matrimonial interns.' Conversations with other Women (2005)Is Bridesmaids a Hangover for chicks? In a small way, yes, but Bridesmaids is better, even in the scatological scene where a dress fitting turns into a hilarious disaster as the girls head for the nearest head. I remember a cruder attempt at fundament fun in Hangover.It's all about best friends Annie (Kristen Whig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph) preparing for Lillian's wedding with Annie as a maid of honor who is clueless about arranging a wedding. The conflict arises when another maiden challenges her for best-friend status and maid of honor honors.Bridesmaids has its share of stereotypes: cute but amorously lost Annie (Kristin Wiig), plain but lovable affianced Lillian (Maya Rudolph), fat and randy Megan (Melissa McCarthy), perfectly pretty, wealthy snob Helen (Rose Byrne), et al. Yet amidst these types we've seen before is a story of loss and redemption not so heavily attended to in other Judd-Apatow produced romcoms.Director Paul Feig lets the pathos in when the comedy needs a rest, and writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo infuse the dialogue with an unusual intelligence. Unfortunately the off-beat wit ends as the film sags midway with Annie's emotional and amorous problems struggling with jealousy over Helen's high-end bridal arrangements and combat with selfish lover Ted (Jon Hamm) and blue collar cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd).The film revives when the requisite going-to-Vegas breakout happens even before the girls get there—on the plane in some set pieces about drugs and booze and flight attendants that sure beat Snakes on a Plane and Airport for a smart mix of slapstick and satire.Bridesmaids is a leap forward for intelligent comedy where characters overcome stereotypes to be memorable and insightful about the challenges 30-something women face in a society where their voices are more frequently heard above the din of dim-witted boy men. But the best was at the beginning when the girls are overcome with bad food that poisons their dress fitting and provides the best potty shenanigans ever, spilling over, so to speak, into sink and street.",Null,3,7,12 May 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," It's fun, but you can bet your Bilbo it's long.
","Director Peter Jackson has few equals when it comes to special effects, especially the digital kind. This adapted prequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is rampant with the effects as Bilbo Bagins (Martin Freeman), the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and a motley crew of thirteen dwarfs (not as cute by far as Snow White's), under the leadership of Thorin (Richard Armitrage), go searching for the lost dwarf kingdom of Eredor to reclaim it from the dragon Smaug. It's an arguably long opening sequence, where Gandalf tries to enlist the happy Bilbo to become a 'burglar' to win back the Lonely Mountain, to bring the dwarfs home. In this regard Tolkien and Jackson embrace the theme common to many kiddie lit tomes: 'There's no place like home.' The set pieces are almost always about fighting, be it stone monsters as large as mountains or wolves the size of elephants. Although I didn't get to see the much heralded 48 frames-per-second digital cinematography (as opposed to the usual 24), I did have 3-D, used to good effect as much detritus is thrown against the screen. It's all of one piece, cliff hanging heroes saved by the wit and magic of Gandalf or the heart of Bagins. The appearance of Gollum (Andy Serkis) with the ring that changes things forever merits attention as he and Bilbo match wits over riddles. But then again, Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), the visionary elf queen, provides needed visual relief from the ugly trolls and dwarfs. The Lord of the Rings trilogy deserved to be just that, three installments needed to tell the story. For this Hobbit tale, I expect one go at it would be enough. But not for the voracious Peter Jackson, who has much more New Zealand to traverse before he rests his camera. The Hobbit is long but fun, not great but entertaining.",Null,6,22,12 December 2012
Before Sunset," The urgency is real and surprisingly dramatic.
","`But at my back I always hear/ Time's winged chariot hurrying near.'Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy) in Paris 9 years after a one-night stand.  His book tour is over; he has only an hour before he goes to the airport, an hour before the sunset of their relationship.  As director Richard Linklater (`Before Sunrise') tracks them through Paris streets renewing their passion, we are constantly aware Jesse must return to the airport.  Marvel's `winged chariot' is ever present in `Before Sunset.'The tension and the love are balanced in the screenplay by writer/director Linklater with Hawke and Delpy's collaboration. The real drama is in the talk, whether it be about reincarnation, cable TV, or sex.  The effortlessly natural conversation comes from the three's organic development of the material and the truth of the situation: These two loved each other for a brief moment and are capable of loving again even though he is married with a child and she has become cynical about love.  Hawke plays Jesse as nervous but romantically inclined (His book is about their affair).  He shows discomfort at the beginning of their renewal just as any person would.  Delpy plays her caution behind her chatterbox surface until the real feelings emerge above that surface.  All the while the sun is ticking their time away.Because the film is close to real time, the urgency is real and surprisingly dramatic. When Jesse tries to describe his frustrating marriage, he says, `I feel like I'm running a small nursery with someone I used to date.' That's also good writing.'Baby, you are gonna miss that plane,' Celine says. Fade to credits.Make sure you rent `Before Sunrise' and also hope Jesse misses the plane so that, in the spirit of Michael Apted's 7-up series, we can see how it all plays out in another 9 years when they reach their 40's.",Null,0,0,9 July 2004
Non-Stop," Back off an international flight for a while--this is good thriller stuff.
","Bill Marks (Liam Neeson): 'I hate flying. The lines. The crowds. The delays . . . . ' Jen Summers (Julianne Moore): 'I always kinda liked it. Six hours. One seat. Nobody can get to you.'So you ask me to recommend a film after the Oscars and before the better summer fare. Ordinarily I'd tell you to wait until then because this time of year traditionally offers mediocre or worse movies. Now I can recommend an enjoyable experience with all the thriller tropes in good form and a hero to be admired: Non-Stop with Liam Neeson. Contrary to the above quote from Jen, somebody 'gets' everyone associated with this flight.Neeson's Bill Marks is an alcoholic air marshal who doesn't like to fly and gets caught in an electronic terror aboard a transatlantic flight to London. He's trying to find out who aboard is sending texts calling for a passenger death every 20 minutes until the airline puts $150 Million into a safe account. Marks is himself a suspect (the off-shore account is in his name!), and he has to kill to remain in the game.Wait, waitâ€”it gets more fantastical, from a number of suspects the director, Jaume Collet-Serra, has planted in various frames, as any respectable thriller would, to the big red LED lights ticking off explosion time. But what makes it all believable is the unbelievably adept acting of Neeson, who looks heroic with his solid tall frame and crooked nose.Non-Stop does not stop giving the audience faces to put behind the terror, and Neeson turns out to be as resourceful as Denzel Washington's drunken pilot in 'Flight.' The director also deftly careen's through the cabin with Bill to relieve the imprisoning small space feel all planes give, even in movies.Working previously with Neeson, the director knows how to coax the credible out of him, keeping his uncharacteristic smiling for a final scene and not too much of it. Well, who can blame Marks, when troubled but helpful passenger Julianne Moore is the object of that good feeling? Like all air trips, Non-Stop has its dull moments yet enough action to help moviegoers through the movie dead zone to better flights in May.By the way, don't see this film if you fly regularly to London.",Null,0,4,1 March 2014
The Pianist," I haven't recently seen a better depiction of the fatally flawed resistance against Germans.
","Jerzy Kosinski wrote of a boy escaping all over Europe from Nazi oppressors in his classic `Painted Bird,' an alleged autobiography influenced by Roman Polanski's flight as a boy.  Polanski's `The Pianist,' based on a true story in the Warsaw ghetto in 1939, is also said to be autobiographical if you substitute `film director' for the `pianist.'  Kosinski's dramatic situations, memorable right down to the lantern he carries everywhere, are tense and frenetic, even though he is frequently hiding.  Polanski's Polish Jew Szpilman, a concert pianist, just hides, leaving only the powerful first third for the drama and character delineation-the rest is hiding and grubbing for food.  Polanski's flight in Krakow and Warsaw helped Kosinski tell his story; Szpilman's autobiography helped Polanski tell `The Pianist' story.In the first part of the film, Polanski expertly shows us the family of the pianist in a state of quiet decline and denial while the Germans overtake Warsaw and move Jews to the ghetto and eventually `work' camps.  Szpilman's brother is fiery and irresponsible but devoted to overthrowing the Nazis. By contrast, Szpilman passively allows others to save him, usually due to his acclaim as a classical pianist.  That he plays Chopin beautifully attests to why he should be revered and maybe saved.  Yet, Polanski may inadvertently show him to be self-centered when he lets others take great risks to save him, when he watches from his safe window fellow Jews of the resistance being slaughtered, and when he does not fully join the resistance.  Or Polanski may be expressing the anguish and self-loathing of one whose mother did not survive the gas chamber.Except for `Charlotte Gray,' I haven't recently seen a better depiction of the fatally flawed resistance against Germans than in this film.  Polanski has done a credible job showing there was resistance at great peril and price.  He also creates a bombed-out, ruined Warsaw that looks real enough to make the audience catch their breath.Polanski also includes a Platonic admiration between Szpilman and the lovely wife of a friend and supporter-here Polanski is at his `Chinatown' best showing the heartache and natural shocks fortune visits on lovers in war (Think also of Rick and Ilsa in `Casablanca').  By the end, Szpilman is looking more like Tom Hanks in `Cast Away' than Arthur Rubenstein.  The hero is back where he started; I hope the world has progressed beyond that.",Null,1,3,10 January 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Remarkably Graceful!
","'He certainly maintained the illusion with remarkable grace.' about M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).I marvel at how successfully Wes Anderson evokes an era in between wars, the early 1930's of Central and Eastern Europe, in a mythical country, Zubrowka, with a whimsical nostalgia tempered by impending doom for that country and the world as it approaches the Nazis and WWII. Anderson's brilliantly ironic The Grand Budapest Hotel is both light and grave, an admixture of longing for a time that maybe never was or had vanished long before its characters lost it.M. Gustave (Fiennes), the uber concierge of the titular hotel, is the martinet who runs the famous retreat yet the libertine who beds elderly ladies for fun and eventual profit. The will of a certain dowager, Madame D (Tilda Swinton), with whom he has been sleeping, serves as the catalyst for shenanigans by family and friends as they angle for her inheritance and figuratively the evanescent world of moldy decadence.All the while, moody music perfectly composed by Alexandre Desplat evokes the loss of a time but the promise of a new world. The crayon and pastel colors of diorama-like models are more the fantasies of active imaginations than reality. In other words, Wes Anderson, inspired by Austrian Stefan Zwewig's wry autobiography, The World of Yesterday, has it both ways: a love of times past and a vision of the future, seeded by characters that seem aware of the joys and losses accompanying the contract to live. Although this opulent, decadent menagerie of time may never have existed, Anderson evokes a memory of it not that different from what we remember, for instance, from our youths—my memories are of the halcyon years immediately following WWII. My memories are grand if not real. Anderson remembers like his main character, with illusory grace.The Grand Budapest Hotel is worth a visit, but you can't stay and never could have anyway.",Null,1,9,19 March 2014
The Favourite," Witty and raucous, even the jaded will be delighted.
","As a period, drama about baroque palace intrigue, The Favourite, concerning early18th century's British Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) and her courtiers, is a pleasant companion piece to the intrigue-laden Dangerous Liaisons. Only this time the Queen has her eye on her two close female attendants, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), who has been with the queen since childhood, and Abigail (Emma Stone), a former lady arriving at the manor to be a lowly attendant. The principal location, the Jacobean Hatfield House estate in Hertfordshire, is a regal playground for shenanigans fit for pets in cages, like bunny rabbits.Part of the perfection of this killer comedy is the set design with tapestries and furniture as ornate and beautiful as you'd expect in a fine museum. The palace is about as gorgeous as Blenheim, and the costumes are as plush as the draperies. In short, the mise en scene is to die for baroque. This attention to detail is what can be expected of director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Lobster were memorably rich while spare at the same time. In Favourite the occasional use of a disorienting wide lens to survey the house and landscape while furiously moving is worthy of Orson Welles at this wildest.However, it's always about the people, and this house of liaisons and deceptions is two hours of putdowns and poison; not a moment is dull. Abagail's co-opting the Queen's affection from Lady Sarah provides the spark for the fire between the two ambitious young ladies. Without being too obvious, the film speaks powerfully about the need for women then and now to employ serious wit to get around the male-dominated world. The battle has further significance because the Queen needs all the help she can get, and these ladies are ready and willing. Along for the contest are factions of British politics, vying for the Queen's attention to a real-world battle with the French.As the credits roll, some of the film's eccentricity becomes evident: 'Nude Pomegranate Tory' and 'Fastest Duck in the City' remind how silly and yet shocking it can be. Notwithstanding the chapter headings like 'The Mud Stinks,' from Handel through Vivaldi to modernist Anna Meredith, the music counterpoints the raucous doings, which are accompanied by biting, crisp dialogue.Through it all the determining factor is the off-balance Queen, whose whimsy could bring down a kingdom. The comparison can be made to contemporary times, where a chaotic White House begs for overthrow or at least complete dysfunction. History repeats, and if it must, we'd do well to look back a few centuries when palace intrigue appears highly amusing but through a camera lens, frightening.",Null,2,7,12 December 2018
Seabiscuit," See `Seabiscuit' if you want to see the best American movie this summer.
","Jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) quotes Shakespeare to describe his 1938 `Horse of the Year': `Though she be but little, she is fierce.' Such is also the quality of a relatively `little' film, released in mid summer after larger disappointing films like `Hulk'. See `Seabiscuit' if you want to see the best American movie this summer. This is what American filmmakers do well-a rouser with messages, bigscreen chases, sentimentality for the little guy, depression-era caring. `Seabiscuit is `Rocky' for horses. Director Gary Ross (`Pleasantville') has written and directed a classic American film with stars Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper, and William H. Macy, all of whom contribute enough character and charm to overwhelm all other Hollywood films this summer and any shortcomings of this film itself. Chris Cooper (`Adaptation') is so believable as a horse whisperer that he may win another Oscar. When he says, `You don't throw a whole life away just because it's banged up a little,' the thought resonates for almost everyone in the film, a tribute to unity of theme and expression of actor. The true story of Seabiscuit's triumphs reflects the spirit of the 20th-century depression, when people salvaged their lives and a government cared to help them (compassionate conservatism defined!). Though Bridges' auto tycoon and horse owner never really suffers the losses of the masses, he seems to represent President Roosevelt's beneficent stewardship by resisting layoffs in his factories and encouraging everyone to look to a brighter future. The death of his son, however, symbolizes his share in everyone's losses. Today I also saw my favorite French film of the summer, `Swimming Pool,' which lingers on the beautiful mind and body of a middle-aged woman (Charlotte Rampling) as it explores her as writer-that's what the French do well, subtle and sexy. America and France have bright futures separate and together, in film and the world. Viva la difference!",Null,0,0,24 July 2003

","'You guys don't exist, we don't exist and actually, if you're caught, we'll call you terrorists.' Secretary (Tom Wilkinson)Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is about as exciting as a franchise thriller could be, and with Tom Cruise and crew, it's guaranteed to be fun and glamorous. And it is.Because he is held responsible for a Kremlin bombing, Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) team must go it on their own to clear their name by stopping a missile from landing on earth. It's going to be launched by a world-class crackpot, so it isn't going to be easy although traveling to Dubai and Mumbai has a certain charm if your life isn't constantly in danger.The thrilling part of this best MI adventure yet is the technology and stunts, as it has always been. Add to that potent mix the total immersion of IMAX, and you will feel a part of the team while your scan some of the world's best looking cities appearing bigger than life.Computers, eye scanning devices, an ingenious cloaking device (wait till you see them use this outrageously creative screen), and disguises are only part of the paraphernalia used to get them inside The Kremlin. Watching Hunt scale the tallest building in the world in Dubai is just as delicious, especially because Cruise is reputed to do his own stunts. By the way, he keeps from becoming too self impressed at almost every turn with his ironic grin and recurring playfulness.Along to do the heavy emotional lifting is Jeremy Renner as Brandt, a team member with a questionable past that gives Renner a chance to show off his Oscar-nominated acting chops (from Hurt Locker).

What the hell are you doing carrying my child? I mean, why didn't you just get rid of it when you had the chance? Because listen to me, listen to me, I got news for you - I wish to God that you had!' Nothing 'revolutionary' about Revolutionary Road, a period piece about a '50's couple in decline after moving to the burbs. I can confirm the creatively deadening effect of moving from city to country, even at a time when the American Dream included lawns, garages, flower beds, and conventional neighbors. Director Sam Mendes gets it mostly right.Leo DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet's April Wheeler dream the dream and act on it in 1955, he with a business sales job and she staying home with the two kids. Her epiphany that they should move to Paris eventually persuades him they are living a 'hopeless' and 'empty' suburban idyll. All this is the usual slam of the vapid 50's, yet Mendes brings his especially trenchant appreciation of America to the screen as he did in American Beauty, only here it is more realistic and less romantic.Mendes had the memorable red roses image in American beauty; he does it again with shots of Frank in his fedora going to work with all the other drones in fedoras. Mendes is helped by fine performances from his leads, whose universe has expanded considerably since they were on the deck of the Titanic.Most of all is the poignancy of today's mortgage crisis, in which the seeds are sown through the discontent of a couple considering themselves not unlike the others but falling into the wishes that lead to frustration and loss.

28 Days Later...," The best horror/zombie film since George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead, and maybe better.
","`28 Days Later,' by British director Danny Boyle (`Trainspotting'), is the best horror/zombie film since George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead, and maybe better.  The eerie set design is appropriate without being overdone (Rod Serling would have approved its restraint), the characters are real without being overwrought (especially the women, who are usually sacrificed to too much emoting), and the subtexts about contemporary crises are clear without distracting from the science fiction genre itself.Experimental monkeys have transmitted a `rage virus' in England so that the population is largely decimated and the island quarantined by the rest of the world. Left in a Blade Runner/Mad Max post-apocalyptic country are a few unaffected survivors and some very badly infected `raging' zombies, reflecting Shakespeare's comment that the `strain of man's bred out into baboon and monkey.' Jim (Cillian Murphy) and Selena (Naomie Harris) are 2 survivors who hook up with a family to find an army outpost near Manchester (Remember a similar setup in Romero's `Dead') for protection. Not only does the film intelligently confront the old `man's -inhumanity-to-man' and `survival-of the fittest' themes, but it also glosses the meaning of life and the need for community. That Jim and Selena are different races adds to the universal quality of the film.Does it include the formulaic elements of the horror genre? Yes, but with restraint: it has low-key lighting, quick cuts, and stupid moves without drawing attention to them.  The cuts give you the sense of danger and horror without forcing you to dwell on hokey or horrible effects. John Murphy's score intelligently and creatively supports and contrasts meaning and mood.The spreading contagion, quickly transmitted by blood or saliva, is much like AIDS in Africa (the prominent zombie of the film is black), and the military response reminds of the worst conditions of the war in Iraq or anytime where anarchy is allowed to grow. When Jim asks, `What's the government doing about it?' the reply is `There is no government.'  Jim sums up the naïve populace response when he says, `What do you mean? There's always a government!'No film this year has so entertained my grandson, Cody, and me with such humanism and suspense as `28 Days Later.'

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Rich Rise
","Summer 2011 winds down with an effective prequel to a storied franchise. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an enjoyable addition to the Planet of the Apes canon, which began in 1968. This version is so placed as to be an 'alternate history' because it is set in modern time, a big difference from when Charlton Heston rocketed to the place.It's the humanity that makes the sci-fi difference, as it did in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: not just animals or creations aping, if you will, humans, but also humans showing the gamut of good and evil, sometimes in the extreme. The humanity of the apes is well-defined in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the humans not so much. However, the pride and bigotry are the same as the Greeks spied thousands of years ago.James Franco's scientist, Will Rodman, has developed a serum to make apes smarter, and it also seems to cure Alzheimer's disease. As we watch his chimp, Caesar (Andy Serkis and special effects—remember him as Kong and Gollum?), develop intelligence, we also are beneficiaries of superb motion-capture effects at work. It would be difficult to improve the lifelike features of the chimps, whose eyes are the proverbial windows to their natures.The film has its clichéd moments when the serum and the chimps get out of control, but the struggle with the San Francisco PD on the Golden Gate, while not a new concept, has some genuine fine photography and gymnastics, a highlight of a film disappointing in scenes involving just humans. Those graphics make it all seem possible while the broader thematic interpretation of playing god is never lost among the stunning visuals.It's not innovative, but it is at the end of summer, a time to relax with science fiction that doesn't insult.",Null,0,1,15 August 2011
City of God," Scorsese on steroids!!
","Scorsese on steroids: Fernando Meirelles' 'City of God' is more like 'Goodfellas' than 'Gangs of New York, ' but the gritty urban swaggering, gratuitous violence, and lost innocence are there. Rio is New York with favelas even poorer than Harlem's at its worst. Yet the energy and romance of young people of all ages digging out of poverty through crime is there as it was so long ago in Buenel's 'Los Alvidados.' Latinos just do better than gringos in making poverty and crime a story worth something.From the very first sequence, where narrator Rocket stands like DiCaprio in front of the gang and slowly morphs into his younger self to tell the story from the beginning, Meirelles establishes the art and romance of Rocket's story. It will go from lonely child to wary photographer amidst a carnage of city crime unmatched recently except for 'Amores Perros.' The character development of gang leaders is remarkable, given their number and complexity, and cinematographer Cesar Charlones' almost-MTV quick cuts give a vitality necessary to depict the murder and mayhem of the poor but strong.Benny, L'il Ze, and Knockout Ned are but a few of the colorful and fated leaders to people this sprawling cautionary tale. Unlike their counterparts in 'Gangs of New York,' they are fully defined and developed, sympathetic and fated, no small feat for a director unknown to film-going New Yorkers.The new president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, commented that this film showed a need for change now.

","Although America's love affair with the auto is currently threatening the country's economic and environmental stability, the creators of Toy Story take us to an imaginative world in which there are no humans to upset balances, just cars grooving to the sounds of competition, love, and family values.John Lasseter and Pixar's Cars is an enthusiastic animation about cars that act like humans on a highway, Route 66, that once embodied the American dream of the open road and limitless opportunities as we wended west in search of adventure and sunnier homesteads. The photorealistic cinematography alone is worth seeing, especially the buttes and plains that compete with the real Monument Valley and Grand Canyon for majesty.But the heart of the film rests on heart, the need to find and nurture someone special, the need to love competitors and maybe sacrifice even for them, the need to respect the elderly, and the need to preserve the past embodied in the solid values of small town and big heart. This is all red-state red meat, and Hollywood may be pandering to its own neocon critics, yet the tone and themes seem just right for any of us who have had the luxury of small town community love. This film's Radiator Springs, long forgotten with the construction of interstate route 40, contains the enduring seeds of friendship and caring that the hipper LA, where Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is bound to compete for the Piston Cup Championship, has long forsaken.Not forgotten but just hibernating is old Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), who has a few races under his hood and much to say about life to Lightning. So effective is Newman's voice, with its evocation of all the hot-shot characters Newman has played, that Hudson becomes a sage, elderly Butch Cassidy, car no more. As well does the film become much more than a brilliant animation: It delivers sentiment closer to us lovers of autos than toys or bugs or closet bugaboos could ever. We just love our cars.",Null,1,3,6 June 2006
Avengers: Infinity War," Yeah, every bit as good as critics say and more.
","Because my index for great epic adventure is dictated by Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the Marvel heroic tales like Avengers: Infinity War supply my modern need to experience excellence but fall short of Homer's weighty themes and complex characters. However, with super-human visuals, contemporary heroic films do a credible job of taking the place of my imagination. Not that that substitution is preferable to Homer's working my mind to create Cyclops and Sirens and assorted baddies as well as the original modern smart hero, Odysseus.The Avengers and their buddies must come together to fight the mighty Thanos (Josh Brolin), whose goal as he decimates half the universe's population is to possess all six infinity stones. Because Vision (Paul Bettany) has the last one, you have an idea what the ending choreography will look like. Yes, there will be the usual explosions and guns, which still strike me as incredulously outdated even though super-hero films abound with the munitions. I see in Infinity fewer explosions and fistfights than I have previously witnessed, a source of my abiding criticism of this genre. The Russo brothers directors have judiciously larded the film with these tropes while leaving plenty of room for wisecracks, a joy for me.Nobody does them better than Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), with his better-than-thou intelligence and impeccably caustic wit: 'I swore off dairy, then Ben and Jerry's named a flavor after me.'Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) has some good ones as well: 'Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except it sucks. So let me do the plan, and that way, it might be really good.' I like the witty repartee much more than the explosions.With as many major warriors as could be possible on one screen, Infinity rarely develops character as we should expect in any drama, Greek or otherwise. Yet, the writers and directors can then guarantee the action to be constant and no one fall asleep, except those hard-core comic-book fans that wait for the scene after the end credits. The final conflict guarantees a financially-rich opening for part two, which will have to move some to match the record-breaking first weekend take for Infinity. Homer would be happy enough with the new epics but much happier that his adventurers are guaranteed infinity or at least immortality.",Null,1,4,30 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," You MUST see this. It's 241 min of romance tempered by tough nostalgia.
","Twenty-five years after Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino is still getting our attention. Today in Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood he takes a calmer, less sardonic view of the passage of cultural time from The Graduate, Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy, and other great '60's classics and the future '70's greats like Taxi Driver, Star Wars, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The Hollywood mojo was impressive in those decades, and he loves it all.By focusing on almost has-been TV star Rick (Leo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt), writer/director Tarantino can be wistful about a Hollywood that has reached its peak in the 60's and hard-nosed about the wars like Vietnam and murders like Manson's to temper the almost giddy love of movies divorced from reality. Never is he sappy or sarcastic, just mindful throughout of the passage of time and innocence.In the 2 hrs 41 min, however, he doesn't cut scenes when he should such as the re-creation of old TV show segments just too long and dull to be anything but slow. However, when the two stars are together the magic of old Hollywood is present, even if they can't compete with Newman and Redford.Never one to rely just on meticulous re-creation of an era (his details are marvelous), Tarantino plays with the lost innocence motif, even with war raging on TV and producers assassinating the careers of stars. Still, this is a milder, gentler Tarantino, unlike Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, for instance. As a loving take on violence and loss, he allows himself to honor the movies, from when he was a nerdy, video geek to a formidable auteur.See this romantic rendition of the sixties by arguably one of the best artists in the world. At the least it's entertaining, at the best it blends our benign nostalgia with the evanescence of fame, beauty, and peace.",Null,9,19,29 July 2019
Django Unchained," Unparalled Tarantino
","'Django. The D is silent.' Django (Jamie Foxx), when asked his name.Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds are two of my favorite movies in his canon. Make Django Unchained a third member of that list, for it is a delightful satire of spaghetti westerns and westerns in general with a generous dose of righteous civil rights.Tarantino's mock heroic sensibility has never been better, his anachronisms more appropriate, and his overall sense of humor so refined as to make me feel Mel Brooks and Steve Martin had collaborated on his upbringing. At the same time that Tarantino is showing off his comedic shops, he's also telling an exciting adventure of the titular hero as freed slave, underplayed just right by Jamie Foxx.Django joins with bounty hunter and verbal gymnast Dr. King Schultz (the not-quite scene munching Christoph Waltz), to kill wanted bad boys until Django and Schultz can free Django's wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington), and kill her captors. Her owner, however, is Calvin Candie, a dandy plantation mogul, played with such relish by Leonardo DiCaprio that he may pick up a best supporting Oscar if not for other worthy candidates such as Tommy Lee Jones in Lincoln.But then there's another candidateâ€”Samuel L. Jackson as the savvy, sly head of household slaves. For those who remember his bad-ass roles and especially his turn with John Travolta in Tarantino's iconic Pulp Fiction, Jackson almost steals the show.No matter who steals what in this new Tarantino, know that it will be a classic for good reason, chained forever to the works of a great director who takes chances and succeeds in practically every frame.'How do you like the bounty-hunting business?'

Get Out," Want humor and horror? You got it!
","Jordan Peele has a future as a writer -director. So expertly does he navigate genres in Get Out that I'm struggling to come up with one descriptor; rather I want to put them all in a stew and hyphenate: horror-comedy-social commentary-psychological thriller.Young black man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), goes for weekend with white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) to her parents' home way out in the woods. The scary tropes are all there including strange servants and wacky psychologist mom (Katherine Keener), all overseen by equally off-center neurosurgeon dad.If you mash up Guess Who's Coming to dinner with Stepford Wives and add a dash of Freddy for scary laughs, then you'll understand my enthusiasm for this first effort by an entertainer now firmly right behind Damien Chazelle for young, promising filmmakers. Enjoy brains tossed in a trash bucket and wildly-inappropriate social comments (comments that at the same time as the humor allow Peele to draw on the absurdities of contemporary correctness and social engineering). No social hot button about the place of minorities is not pushed, albeit superficially, but in depth for a horror film.Now I know why I was so disappointed in the recent Split directed by M. Night Shyamalan: His horror flick was aiming for the expected twist without finesse and understatement. Get Out is assuredly aiming at the incendiary interracial flash point while it attends to issues of conformity and mind control in contemporary society.This film, however, never loses its sense of humor when it regularly lards the narrative with cell phone conversations between Chris and his shlubby buddy, Rod (LilRel Howlery). It's hilarious use of ethnic humor to advance the plot and provide comic relief from the considerably-scary goings-on. I haven't laughed as heartily as this in a long time.As amused as I was with Peele's virtuosity, I was perplexed that such a fine genre buffet as this should be released at dumping-ground movie-release time. Surprisingly as well, I have not been as vicariously scared in a long time, perhaps because, stripped of its horror and humor, Get Out is also about us all with our private prejudices fueled by our need to control others when we can't control ourselves.Enjoy this rich amalgam of light-hearted hokum and genre mixing--or enjoy excellent filmmaking.",Null,9,20,27 February 2017
Drive," Modern Noir
","'If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place. I give you a five-minute window, anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours no matter what. I don't sit in while you're running it down; I don't carry a gun... I drive.' Driver (Ryan Gosling) I can't believe it! Driver is a suitable companion to The Debt and Point Blank, two outstanding thrillers of summer 2011. Maybe it's because I just co-hosted a Western film series with heavy doses of Eastwood. While this film features a lone hero, Driver (Ryan Gosling), in the taciturn mode of Westerns and Scorsese urban tales, it also is a study of small time hoodlums trying to get along. Drive is a blend of action and psychology as we try to figure out how this Hollywood stuntman drives for crimes, survives, and quietly loves his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son, Benecio (Kaden Leos). Protecting those two is the clue to seeing the other side of his robotic mien, the entrée into his humanity. Alas, that care is the source of losing his independence and safety. With the likes of criminal kingpin Bernie Rose (a surprisingly effective Albert Brooks) hanging about, no one, not even our ultra-competent hero, is safe.Director Nicholas Winding Refn has jumped to the head of the line for cinematography that matters (see the reflective shots), elevating what may be a classic thriller into a study of marrying sight to meaning. Wait! Wait! The original music by Cliff Martinez has vocals so well wedded to meaning as to make even me, a screenplay-loving critic, take notice. When I began seeing Robert De Niro as I watched Driver's lonely odyssey, and when I thought of Steve McQueen driving the hills of San Francisco as Driver careened through L.A.'s mean streets, I knew I was in the presence of a modern noir with the trappings of a classic.",Null,9,26,8 September 2011
Insidious," Would have been better as a comedy.
","Astral projection (out of body experience) is the real heart of the paint-by-numbers horror sideshow Insidious. A family keeps moving from haunted houses until it realizes the demon is in their child, not the houses, and the other demons want him. Saw's James Wan directs this sometimes amusing hodgepodge without Saw's bloody business or a modicum of innovation. At least it has the guts to avoid overdoing the CGI.The demons, who seek the body of young Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) because he astral projects and leaves it frequently, are the motliest crew I have ever seen, from desiccated brides to downright devils with tails, a posse of poltergeist fiends not quite as alarming as they might be in Dawn of the Dead or Shaun of the Dead, for that matter.The haunted house evokes images of The Haunting, and just as cheesy as that film is this one. Even The Exorcist's darkly painted violence is here with a priest in tow. Insidious never comes close to the fear I felt in The Descent or the interesting layering of characters in 28 Days Later, but it has its scary moments and even humor.Yes, the nerdy fixers are funny, the technicians that is, who use a variety of outdated machines to film and capture the dead seeking the bodies of the living.Insidious would have worked as a comedy.",5,11,35,31 March 2011
The Theory of Everything," It has everything.
","'I have a slight problem with the whole celestial-dictator premise.' Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) The Theory of Everything has everything a Hollywood melodrama requires: attractive people fighting big odds and loving happily ever after. Except that this is the story of the rock star of cosmologists, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), stricken in his twenties with motor neuron disease, related to ALS and Lou Gehrig, and predicted to claim his life within 3 years.Only it doesn't, and this heroic, brilliant professor spends his life thinking and writing, most notably his best-selling book, A Brief History of Time. Because this screenplay is an adaptation of his wife, Jane's (Felicity Jones) memoir, Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, the film is largely about their romance, which is nicely done, and their three children (a bit of a drag), and a brief episode or two of his actually lecturing about his theories of black holes, time, and the super question about the existence of God, whom Stephen makes a part of his argument..But if it has to be an emphasis on the challenges of their marriage and divorce, writer/director James Marsh has done well keeping the maudlin at bay and showing a sincere love between the principals. Eddie Redmayne should be nominated for an Oscar—he gets all the Hawking tics down remarkably well, going beyond Daniel Day-Lewis's virtuoso performance in My Left Foot.Add to all this-- good movie-making: D.P. Benoit Delhomme drapes the frame in soothing rich color, enhancing my exalted notion of all things British. The Theory of Everything is a classic romantic biopic, satisfying like shepherds' pie on a cold winter's day.",Null,3,7,20 November 2014
Frozen," Pure Disney with 21st Century Points
","'Hi, everyone. I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!' (voice of Josh Gad)That self-introduction by a cute snowman will give you an idea of how contemporary and friendly the newest Disney animation is. When my granddaughter declared Frozen was the best movie she ever saw, I determined to see it because any recommendation from a 12-year old must be heeded. Although Frozen turned out to be not a tear-jerking Casablanca, it is one of Disney's best musical animations and high-grade nectar for pre- teens. Smartly pushing the theme of love, it covers all the fairy-tale bases from challenged princesses, multiple suitors, lovable animals, and enough magic to make a kingdom.Elsa (Idina Menzel voice) is the heir apparent to the kingdom but has a wicked curse that freezes things and isolates her because of it. Determined to get her sister back and break the curse, Anna (Kristen Bell), along with working-class hunk Kristoff (Jonatham Groff), seeks out her sister in her remote ice palace. Although you pretty much know what will happen, directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee with Lee's screenplay never descend to the maudlin or cheap romance. Love is the object to melt the world, and it doesn't come easily.Making the old Hans Christian Anderson story contemporary is as easy as having Kristoff exclaim when his sled burns, 'Ahh, and I just got it paid off!' The preparation for teenage and adult responsibilities is laced with comments like Kristoff's to Anna: 'Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?' The combination of romance and reality is effective, no more so than with the big, Broadway-like songs perfectly matched to the theme.The challenges are many, not quite as physical as often happens, to make the defeat of evil, not quite as evil as usual either, rightly earned. Despite the possible interpretations such as a need for inclusion and the solitude of being different (gay?), Frozen should warm the whole family with its humor and adventure. But be careful with your pre-teen girls: This movie empowers young women to make their own life and fight their own battles. I hope that translates to your house peacefully.",Null,0,2,8 January 2014

Speaking of hot, the core of the earth is boiling over from too much sun, spots that is, and John Cusack, in a role usually reserved for Nick Cage's bank account, plays a writer fated to save the world from earthquakes, tsunamis, and Woody Harrelson.

The chaos is not just from the number of set pieces and abundance of baddies but also from loose narrative where transitions seem random or barely connected.Saddest of all is to see one-time Oscar winner Cage once more sell his name to a product not worthy of him.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Right behind Da Vinci Code for highly entertaining, light summer fare.
","By the government's finding the cure for the mutant strain in X-Men: The Last Stand, the death knell has rung for the tripartite series inspired by the comic book series. What more can I say? Society might be considered better if, for instance, there were no 'mutant' gays or power hungry politicians, or at least that's what some would say about the mixed blessing. Thus there is no future for this franchise, or not? Director Bryan Singer, going to Superman Returns for later this summer, gave the final franchise installment to Bret Ratner, whose action sequences are first-rate but whose subtlety is less sure. Set in the near future, X-Men III brings the mutants together, from the benign Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the nefarious Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) to the edgy Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and atmospherically beautiful Storm (Halle Barry) to decide if a cure is a good or bad thing. Having fire or ice come out of your hands isn't bad, but when you are so powerful that you kill your boyfriend with a touch, reconsideration of the benefits is badly needed.The newer X-Men comic books reflect Joss Whedon's genius by relying heavily on the allegorical elements that make alternative life styles and George Bush come to mind without much work. As successful as the multiple-approaches are for literary sleuths like me, they are not dealt with deeply enough because the American obsession with graphics almost always trumps the themes. In this case, some interaction between mutants and the general populace on a daily basis might have created a better sense of the complicated, ambivalent conundrum facing those who give and take the cure.But this is summer, and X-Men: The Last Stand stands tall with MI-3 and right behind Da Vinci Code for highly entertaining, light fare that occasionally rips itself from special effects to entertain philosophies European cinema takes for granted.But do be uncharacteristically American and sit through the very last shot and the credits to see if the future of X-Men can be finally predicted, The Last Stand notwithstanding.",Null,1,11,23 May 2006
The Lives of Others," The globe's best . . .
","'Who knows the secrets of the human heart?' Col in The Crying Game WhenI saw 2006's Oscar winning Departed, I was satisfied it could be the best picture of the year; then I saw Pan's Labyrinth and thought it imaginatively superior; then I saw Lives of Others, the Oscar choice for best foreign film, and I knew it was the globe's best film of the year, no argument.Lives of Others is what all movie making should strive to be: interesting characters, thrilling plot, superb acting, and thematic weight. It's set in East Berlin, 1984, five years before the Wall's fall and Gorbachev's 'glasnost' and still felling the tremors of Nazism, in this case the Stasi, a government agency similar to the SS. Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a Stasi teacher and coldly efficient information gatherer, surreptitiously watches playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) to get compromising details that would damn Dreyman and open the romantic way for the culture minister, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme). Oddly for an artist, Dreyman is loyal to socialism, so it is through Sieland that the information must come.The dramatic hub of this absorbing intrigue is the growing affection Wiesler gains for the actress and coincidentally the underground freedom movement, mostly as it is represented by artists and their friends. While his efficiency is amply evident in his cool detachment, similar to that of Rafe Fiennes in Schindler's List and Serg Lopez in Pan's Labyrinth, his humanity seeps out at the edges as he becomes vicariously involved in the artists' lives. First-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck misses not a beat in slowly revealing the hearts of all his principals while he creates a plot remarkably interesting for a character-driven piece.Few films could mine the rich conflict between the totalitarian state and artists who yearn for freedom of expression, between the loyalties of friends and lovers and the crushing exigency of survival. Lives of Others shows how difficult it is to watch others' lives unfold and not be drawn to their passion. It's rough out there: No other film of 2006 showed that cliché better. Here's looking at you, best film of the year.",Null,36,45,7 March 2007
Hellboy," An existential comic book made into a movie!
","Hell hath no fury like an `X-Files' type of film faithfully adapting a revered comic book with the darkly existential theme of  `choices.' Director Guillermo del Toro's `Hellboy' playfully brings to life the story of a demon from hell conjured by WWII Nazis occultists under the supervision of the legendary Rasputin and freed by US troops to fight ghosts and monsters for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.
Mike Mignola created the hero after characters he loved in the works of Clark Ashton Smith and H.P. Lovecraft (among others) with a geeky devotion that includes quirky characters and pow-crash violence in the spirit of Jack Kirby's classics. The screenplay by del Toro is based largely on the first trade paperback collection of `Seed of Destruction' and its subsequent `Wake of the Devil' and `Right Hand of Doom.'I love the ironic world-weariness Ron Perlman brings to the titular hero his frustrating pursuit of pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  In between are the usual monstrous battles, wacky professor, and historical villain-just about every comic book cliché wrapped up in an energetic, visually rich experience. Covering the whole experience is a theme about choices: A man proves who he is not by heredity or chance but by the choices he makes.  An existential comic book made into a movie!How good is it?

Room," Oscar worthy.
","'For love all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room an everywhere.' John DonneThink of a relationship more powerful than a mother and child, and you'll be wrong. Room, directed without glamour but with tenderness—many close-ups—by Lenny Abrahamson and written lovingly from her book by Emma Donoghue, is the essence of such a relationship: a young woman, Joy (Brie Larson), imprisoned by a wacko for 7 years and bearing a child, Jack(Jacob Tremblay) who stays with her for 5 before they escape.The first half of the film ever so gently shows the creative power of a mother, who does not let her cloistered son want for ideas and perspective about the world they see on TV and through her eyes. Although Larson's performance is low key and she does nothing spectacular, the reason Jack is so well developed without meeting the world is because of her composed love.The second half delivers us from the almost idyllic 'room' to the outside world, where Jack faces a reality almost blindingly real, filled with germs and a grandfather, Robert (William H. Macy), who can't talk to him because of Jack's paternity. Yet there is grandma (Joan Allen), who loves Jack and to whom Jack can say one of his first endearments beyond his mother. The power of this film is its unwillingness to accelerate his acclimation; rather like ripening fruit, that growth takes its own time.Tremblay is a discovery of an exceptional actor—we should see him again soon and for his lifetime. Larson is already an accomplished actress who brings subtle intelligence to difficult roles (see her in Short Term 12). Besides the other very fine actors is the outstanding Joan Allen as Grandma Nancy-just think about the layers of reaction she must have with a daughter returning from a kidnapping and a grandson who needs the gentlest nurturing.The cast does what is needed to bring off one of the best films of the year and Oscar nominations aplenty.",Null,2,10,21 November 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A pleasant romance for the holidays.
","'Life is about courage and going into the unknown.' Cheryl (Kristen Wiig)Forget Bridesmaids and Hangovers, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a comic romance for everyone that eschews raunchiness for real life challenges a dweeb named Walter (Ben Stiller) faces daily. He is everyman, a dreamer who gently supplants his daily dreaming with real life romance.The first part of the film loosely adapts James Thurber's short story in which the now famous introvert dreams of various heroic adventures, mostly as he tries to impress his co-worker Cheryl. The latter part of the film concerns his real adventures tracking down a famous but reclusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Director Stiller plays it low key while he gently shapes the passive hero into an active one. The director calmly moves into a reality more exciting than Mitty's dreams. The multifaceted film, however, loads on the schmaltz and one- dimensional characters while it also touches on the curse of downsizing, using the demise of Life magazine as a setting for the loss of jobs, which Walter experiences. Yet, Mitty is lovable enough for the audience to hope this formerly introverted dork can save himself from unemployment and loneliness. The entire family can enjoy a spirited albeit superficial comedy without scatological or romantic excess. And the lesson about living the dream comes gently and believably.

Across the Universe," A perfect blend
","'Who can protest and does not, is an accomplice in the act.' The TalmudToo long I have been waiting for an heir to the creative energy of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, but I found it in Julie Taymor's Across the Universe. Both use already established music to fit the book of classic stories about love and loss. Taymor's equals the visual virtuosity but doesn't have the emotional range of Luhrmann's. However, it uses more effectively the music to further the story, in this case the Beatles' canon to reflect the story of '60's era lyrical love and violent protest. It is simply a perfect blend of an era with its music.The '60's and the Beatles are inseparable as the group sang sweet songs of love that also protested adult suppression and the slaughter of thousands in an unjustifiable war in Vietnam. Jude (as in Hey) (Jim Sturgess) is a bloke from Liverpool looking for his natural father in maintenance at Princeton. Better than his limited dad, he finds Lucy (as in diamonds) (Evan Rachel Wood), falls in love, and at one point loses her to the war protest movement, inspiring one of the most imaginative sequences with Strawberry Fields Forever and bleeding berries. Not every song works this well, but at the least they feel organic to the story, much like the songs in the recent eccentric, endearing musical Once. The songs in Across the Universe are variously integrated into the story and introduced softly and naturally. From 'Let it Be' as a lament for fallen soldiers in Nam and citizens in the '67 Detroit riots to simply gorgeous nudes slithering and smooching underwater to 'Because,' it all works.Having spent some time in mid-twentieth century America, I can attest to this film's fidelity to the spirits of revolt and love. The contrast with today is that while love retains iconic status in the culture, the spirit of protest, so worthy of the current illegitimate war in Iraq, is not visible except in the hands of Maureen Dowd and Jon Stewart. The idealists who dominate this vigorous and occasionally languorous musical don't seem to go out much anymore.",Null,13,28,15 September 2007
The Lion King," Photorealism is perfection, a comedy team riffs hilariously, and the rest is just as it was in 1994.
","Life is tough for animals in the African savannah because after all Darwin's survival of the fittest fits best there. Eat or be eaten. Surprisingly the benign Disney empire covers its 1994 The Lion King, a brilliant but not so sweet story of the rise of a young lion, Simba (voice of JD McCrary), eventually to succeed his aging father, Mufasa (James Earl Jones).Director Jon Favreau guides the animation through the most realistic depiction that could be hoped for, more photorealistic than his 2016 The Jungle Book. Although it seems every shot from the original is carefully reprised here, each eye movement, each facial tic is as if it were a photo made just bigger. Above that realism is the real key to The Lion King's success, the humanity that exudes each utterance and each challenge.It's ironic because this is animation with animals who can't disguise their human qualities of love, hate, compassion, forgiveness, and most of all attachment to home and its protection. Simba must find his way back home to protect it-it's that simple, but the veiled Hamlet motif hints of family dysfunction, regicide, and the terrible toll of revenge.Although lamentably Disney doesn't update the story to align with contemporary and actual lion lore that lionesses are the major influences from nurturing and social engineering to getting food. It is a remake that reflects the patriarchal and masculine tradition of dominance that has ruled Western culture for millennia. Really though, look at how ready Nala (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Sarabi (Alfre Woodard) are to share the combat load. Maybe in a makeover someday.Then, they did change 'Hakuna Mutata' from the early meaning of 'No worries,' to a more modern 'Who Cares.' Not the Disney I know but much more real. For new material, listen to Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner riff on warthog Pumba and meerkat Timon. They are a hilarious comedy team ushering in the very modern 'What me worry'?Anyway, a child returns home to love and conflict-so human and so Disney. Then Pixar does well in the family motif, too.

The Incredibles," Powerful like its titular family!
","When my four-year-old granddaughter Addison repeated a line from 'The Incredibles' about the harrowing adventure being the best vacation ever, I knew I had seen a true animation winner. Talk about 'family values,' and no, I have not turned neocon. The best animation of the year is 'The Incredibles,' a Pixar Studios ('Finding Nemo') adventure about a family of superheroes that stays together by doing what they do best, making life miserable for bad guys. Although 'Spy Kids' did a credible job of suggesting family unity to be the sanity solution to a fragmenting world, 'The Incredibles' soars beyond that film to teach lessons pleasantly, unobtrusively, but powerfully, like its titular family.Writer/director Brad Bird ('Iron Giant') has laced humor, both visual and cerebral, with kinetic adventure to please kids who like to see fast vehicles and naughty pranks give into sentimental codas about love and cooperation. As for the adults, when was the last time you enjoyed an intelligent treatment of the middle-age crisis more than 'About Schmidt' with Jack Nicholson? The nicely layered 'Incredibles' tale attacks modernist notions about socializing children into underachieving in order to reach a silly equilibrium as it at the same time exalts the emerging persona's of individual family members embracing their unique strengths.Along the way is the torment of a middle-aged, overweight Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr endangering his marriage by moonlighting his heroics after the family had agreed to retire from the business, and Mrs. Parr (formerly 'Plastigirl') regretting her ample rear end. The film exemplifies Dickens's notion that 'accidents will occur in the best regulated families.' Although the denouement goes as expected, the thrills, humor, and goodness transcend anything the current culture police try to force on the American public.Andre Maurois in 'The Art of Living' expressed well the 'Incredibles' subtext that defies uniformity: 'The leveling influence of mediocrity and the denial of the supreme importance of the mind's development account for many revolts against family life.'",Null,0,1,15 November 2004
The Mist," A refreshing blast.
","Stephen King can be downright scary but with a social sensibilityCarrie and 1408 come immediately to mind. So The Mist is a refreshing blast of King at his best, mixing horror with commentary on absurd, complex, and doomed humanity. The film depicts in Maine a fog rolling in with creatures that eat humans alive and generally cause panic and mayhem of the War of the Worlds and Body Snatchers type.Artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane in good Dennis-Quaid form) is the designated hero for the people trapped in a grocery store while various mist monsters terrorize them. But the over-sized squid and spiders are only director Frank Darabont's visual way of exploring the ambivalence of humans in extreme circumstances.Although he film wrestles with too many major challenges to humans in extremis, thanks goodness it tries and sometimes succeeds with solid results. For instance, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) pulls a Jim Jones with apocalyptic warning tactics that mobilize most of the people in the market against the small band of good guys. Her rant is mostly about conversing with God, who tells her that they are being punished for their heathen natures, much as Pat Robertson blamed the unwashed for 9/11. The question for the good guys is whether or not to eliminate her, an act antithetical to goodness except in extreme survival mode. The larger issue is the influence of the real right and neocons like Dick Cheney, who have made a life of scaring the bejesus out of the common folk.King provides other contemporary socio/political topics such as the ambivalent role of the military, at once responsible for the mutants and at another time savior for the suffering people. Throw in the mix the horrors of euthanasia and class conflict, and you have way too much to deal with in a short horror flick. To its credit, the film uses only minimal CGI to create a 50's kind of intellectual horror, where the people inside the grocery store become more like the monsters without as their primal instinct to survive kicks in.I'm going to Maine next week; I think I'll just sit out the usual fog during unusually balmy fall days. Hey, maybe this overripe allegory is also about global warming!",Null,1,4,27 November 2007
Stardust," You get it both ways.
","In Stardust, you get it both ways: Michele Pfeiffer as a several hundred years old witch and Michele Pfeiffer as a stunningly-youthful 49 years or so of her real face but still a witch. This fantasy-fiction adaptation has a similar bipolarity: The romance of Tristan (Charlie Cox) and Yvaine (Claire Danes) in a strangely magical kingdom just beyond the town Wall's wall is part naïve Princess Bride, part degenerate Pirates of the Caribbean, and a modicum of Lady in the Water.(Tristan has made a promise to his love that he'll catch a falling star by venturing over the wall into the kingdom.) Mind you, I enjoyed the childlike part and the raunchy in equal measure with a unicorn and a man turned mouse on one side and a pirate in drag on the other (Robert De Niro as Shakespeare). I'm just not sure who besides me as man/boy will be attracted to this layered fairy tale. The computer graphics are not the most stunning of the year (a positive condition for those of us surfeited with CGI)), the flying ship hardly realistic, but Michele Pfeiffer's aging body does show some sophisticated effects.Supporting the bipolar air of Stardust is Claire Danes in the titular role (Yvaine is a star landing on earth in the form of an attractive young woman). Danes is an off beauty with a unique smile allowing her to emphasize the ironic with some sardonic turns. Danes just seems too intelligent and is too old (She is the most mature looking and acting 28 year old in Hollywood) to be playing against immature 25 year old Charlie Fox.Yet all the inconsistencies work because the film is essentially intelligent and relatively unadorned. It is interested in the choices young people make (Tristan's initial pursuit of a selfish girlfriend is not suited to him; Shakespeare is bluff and tortured about his cross dressing).So let the pixie dust or stardust or whatever shine on you and enjoy a shower of impressions not always logical but usually delightful. Things are not always as they appear.",Null,7,13,7 August 2007
I Am Legend," Not legendary, but it Will do . ..
","I Am Legend is not 28 Days Later (my nominee for best horror/thriller of all time), but it is good for the post-apocalypse zombie/mutant genre. Sci-fi great Richard Matheson started it all with his novel in 1954; there have been numerous film versions, such as Charlton Heston's Omega Man, that have not been memorable; and this iteration is artistically less than 28 Days but still fun.In other words, the last man standing is a durable conceit, good enough to titillate and deep enough to spark existential thoughts about the meaning of life and an individual's place in a seemingly random universe where one person making a difference is still a feckless cliché.New York City is quarantined for a virus that has either wiped out most of the population or turned them into zombies. A scientist's (uncredited Emma Thompson) cancer cure is the cause of the subsequent plague. Will Smith plays the heroic doctor whose research may defeat the virus, but meanwhile don't go out after sunset, as all George Romero fans know only too well.The shots of vacant New York are arresting (What else to expect from King Kong cinematographer Andrew Lesnie?) especially for those of us used to the difficulty of finding a cab at 5 PM. Will Smith is credible if not just a little too buff (Guess what? a gratuitous shot of him exercising shirtless!) but not too sentimental over the loss of his family to the virus. The notion that Vermont may be the home to survivors, should there be any, is an amusement to this critic, who fled its unsurvivable winters.The formula is in tact, the edge of your seat just right for viewing, and those of us lost in reverie over Twilight Zone are revived. Smith, like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, proves capable of carrying off a film almost solo. Not lost to the star-power of Smith is the sub-textual staple of the zombie/mutant genre that aids is a global threat or ideological extremism makes us all the living dead.",Null,26,56,12 December 2007
A Quiet Place," It will scare you.
","'Who are we if we can't protect them?' Evelyn (Emily Blunt)As a thriller/horror film, A Quiet Place has its allegorical implications, in this case the parental imperative to protect children. Blind monsters plague the Abbott family, who dare not make a sound because those bad boys have acute hearing, with outsized ears to prove it, in their quest for food, human or otherwise. In this above average nail-biter, writer/director John Krasinski is a deft suspense purveyor, ratcheting it up as the family gets closer to greeting the monsters in person. In adherence to the formula, the suspense builds from establishing the problem that the monsters have put the family in defensive mode, to the inevitable standoff.Blunt and Krasinski (playing husband, Lee) are effective as a loving but challenged couple with two children and one on the way. Because the stars are married in real life, a close bond on film may be the reason they are so good in their roles. Because this is a horror film, our sympathy for the besieged fodder is enhanced by their real marriage.The irony that complete quiet is the bane of the monsters is appropriate for millennials, who would wither if their smart phones were not noisily distracting them every hour of the day.",Null,8,16,6 April 2018
Kick-Ass," It kicks comic-book butt.
","'Tool up, honey bunny. It's time to get bad guys.' Damon MacreadyKick Ass kicks the hell out of the serious comic-book hero films like Spiderman because it makes fun of the genre while it has fun indulging in the excesses of both comics and their film adaptations. Dave Lizewski/KickAss (Aaron Johnson) represents every healthy male who has ever dreamed of being a super-hero (and I'm one of that legion). Dave actually makes a costume and goes out to do good, failing at each encounter with evil because, well, he's never been trained in super-hero actions, and he's a klutz. The real thing is played with gusto and uncharacteristic sweetness by Nicholas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy, but the heroine, Mindy Macready/Hit Girl, is played with gusto and tongue firmly in her 12-year old cheek by Chloe Moretz, who dons a hero costume and literally kicks ass. Moretz is memorable as the young sage, Rachel, in 500 Days of Summer, and Cage, well, he hasn't been this good since Leaving Las Vegas.While it's not always easy to tell at any one moment whether Kick-Ass is a full-blown Batman satire or a teen comedy about dorks redux, it is enjoyable for its lighthearted depiction of sanitized violence, corny adolescent romance, and eccentric dad/daughter dealings.Besides the fine lead performances and impeccable pacing by director Matthew Vaughan, the cinematography, a rich color blend and crispness, delivers the visual fun of comics with the high-key clarity of a teen musical. While Kick-Ass is far away from the fan boy fantasy of Sin City, arguably the best comic book adaptation in the last decade, don't let the bullets and badinage keep our teens from enjoying a bit of pop-cult satire as easy to digest as White Castles on late date night—it's sinfully good.",Null,5,17,11 April 2010
Unknown," A nice little thriller
","'Mr. Hopkins, after all, was an axiom of the Merchant-Ivory glory days, in addition to embodying Hannibal Lecter and Richard Nixon. Mr. Neeson, for his part, having played the American sexologist Alfred Kinsey and the Irish revolutionary Michael Collins and given voice to Aslan, the Messianic lion of Narnia, sits squarely at the top of his profession. What are actors of such prestige and pedigree doing in pictures like these?' A.O. Scott, NYT, 'When good actor meets bad movie' Neeson can be forgiven for Unknown, a taut thriller with twists good enough to surprise and characterization believable enough to overcome plot holes endemic to all high-octane thrillers. Granted he's again looking for a lost family member, as he did with his daughter in Taken and this time his wife, Elizabeth (January Jones), but he is such a good actor of such strength that we believe him implicitly even when his sanity and truthfulness can be legitimately questioned. As Scott says in the above New York Times commentary, these great actors participate in at-best 'B' movies at this time of year because they can, and they bring a gravity of commitment that supersedes weak material.Presenting at a Berlin biotech conference, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) is separated from his wife only to discover himself in a situation where he loses his identity and she denies him. Director Jaume Collet-Serra slowly distributes the information before we begin to understand the loss of identity and wife. With its Harrison Ford-Fugitive feel about the chases, at no early point was I sure what the biotech conference had to do with the assassination of an oil prince or Harris's role in the plot.The theme of lost identity is neatly woven into the suspense. It may be I identify with the fear as a traveler who guards his passport with his life, but the film plays on the current techno-terror of identity theft be it at an airport or over the Internet. In any case, Neeson is believable as a man driven almost to madness by the thought that someone has taken his life along with his wife.The introduction of a young cab driver, Gina (Diane Kruger), who saves Harris's life, adds adventure that doesn't detract from the believability. An inspiration of casting is Bruno Ganz as Ernst Jurgen, a private investigator with a checkered past but a lifelong interest in the details that make a difference. Ganz, a German actor of substance for decades, brings energy to his role that leaps over others for powerful screen presence, albeit with almost over-the-top glee.At this dead time of year, when Oscar winners dominate, this little thriller is welcome even if its theme scares the heck out of me.",Null,1,3,22 February 2011

But thankfully good hearts like his father in the quote above, know how rare and salutary love is even if it is same sex.This Oscar-nominated small film deserves its acclaim, from writer James Ivory, who knows a thing or two about rich locales in Italy, to 
Sufjan Stevens' classy score, Call Me is Masterpiece Theater reworked for our time. Just add it to Brokeback Mountain and Moonlight for three peerless, artful depictions of queer love.The languid pace that allows the revolutionary love to grow like ripening fruit is just right for those of us who long for the magical, bucolic Lombardy region at summer with lunches that last delightfully forever.Come to think of, there is little conflict except for the girls who must forsake these handsome men not even knowing they are at the least bisexual but heading to homosexuality at a rapid pace. Call Me By Your Name is a romance as much about adolescent coming of age as it is about the vagaries of love in any form or any age.If you long for the sweet Merchant-Ivory motif set against a seductive Italian hill town, this work of art will inspire you to love again.'He was good, and you were both lucky to have found each other, because... you too are good.'

Gran Torino," Neighborhood war is hell.
","Thug: 'What you lookin' at old man?' Walt Kowalski: 'Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me.'Gran Torino is a grand, enjoyable mess as it veers through racism and revenge with a subtext of satire to confuse the best critic. Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bigoted, Archie Bunker-like Korean War vet and ex-auto worker in Michigan with so much hatred for Asians and in particular the Hmong family next door that he can't talk to them without spewing invective-laden epithets to their faces such as 'gooks' and 'slopes.' He loves his dog and his vintage 1972 Ford Gran Torino, a symbol of his own durable but anachronistic character.When you mix those slurs with Eastwood's Dirty-Harry persona, you can't help but smile at the macho-heavy lines such as at the beginning of this review. And most other Walt lines as well as his growl at anything different, an exaggeration of Eastwood's patented groan attending a swift measure of justice. Given the seriousness of the subject--America adjusting to the shift in its population to Asian, Indian, and Latino, among others--it is challenging that many of Walt's prejudicial lines could be meant as satire with their coded meanings about immigrants' assimilation into a society that still has reservations. Because of the baggage Eastwood brings from manly characters in Dirty Harry to Million Dollar Baby, it is a difficult not to enjoy the nostalgia of his dialogue here, if not laugh out loud in amusement.While Eastwood may get a nod for an Oscar (He won't beat Sean Penn, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, or Frank Langella), many of the other actors are too amateurish not to distract from the weight of an otherwise good film. The cross-generational, cross-cultural relationship between Walt and two of his neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang) and Susan (Ahney Her), relies on the slow change in his prejudices, but such subtlety requires more acting experience than these two neophytes have. And those ethnic thugs: Their wooden bravado is a distraction. But then I thought Christopher Carley as the parish priest, Father Janovich, was also an amateur, and he already has a filmography worthy of a 30 year old actor. So what do I know anyway? Eastwood directed them; he must take the credit.",Null,0,5,23 December 2008
Hero," Cinematography that can easily take over the plot.
","Now and then it's good for both Eastern and Western cultures to redefine the concept of `hero.' Brad Pitt's recent success as Achilles (`Troy') reconfirmed the heroic warrior's physical excellence and foolhardy courage as a hallmark of Hollywood's version. From the East, Jet Li's (`Cradle 2 the Grave') `Nameless' in `Hero' takes a different turn: Although every bit as physical as Pitt's Achilles, he is even more the cunning Ulysses, the hero with brains and a heart with an insightful vision of his country's future and a humble realization about his place.Writer/director Yimou Zhang (`Raise the Red Lantern') tells of China before its first emperor, when the seven kingdoms fought for supremacy and Qin of the northern province was the most powerful ruler and most vulnerable to assassination. `Nameless' is asked to come to the court to tell how he vanquished Qin's three superior warrior enemies. In the course of the narration, Qin is revealed as an inspired leader who uses war for the purpose of eventually uniting all China.Nameless is also revealed as a new kind of hero, one who relies on an intricate design for his plot. Along the way he proves to have a heart as well as a brain. On another allegorical level, the role of the United States as a unifier of the globe, although not initially perceived as benign, through its initiatives in Afghanistan and Iraq makes sense as a parallel to the misunderstood Qin.  Indeed President Bush shares the vision of Qin without perhaps the exceptional intellect of the Asian.Although the film's action at times looks like the digitized and ballet-like `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' it is more like `Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter Spring' with cinematography that can easily take over the plot to become the major character of the drama. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle (`In the Mood for Love') has blindingly vivid colors and desert landscapes looking sometimes like the Sahara and other times Monument Valley. The three different versions of the story Nameless tells in the `Rashomon' tradition are dominated by their own color (red, white, or blue) to reflect different ways of seeing the same event. Doyle confirms: `Every story is colored by personal perceptions.'The definition of hero changes depending on the culture and the times. The dynamic heroes of `The Hero' do not fit Emerson's prediction that `every hero becomes a bore at last.' Perhaps in the sequel.",Null,1,2,22 August 2004
Shrek the Third," The best possible animation production
","A neutered donkey is just a braying ass as far as I'm concerned, and in Shrek the Third Eddie Murphy's once fast talking, acidic, contrary sidekick Donkey becomes just another concerned friend of Shrek. Therein lies my primary criticism of an otherwise crowd-pleasing tale of the Ogre (Mike Myers) and his wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz), tiring of taking care of the Far, Far Away kingdom while the frog king (John Cleese), Fiona's father, is ailing. Upon his death they search for the next-in-line heir to take the burden off the Shreks ('I am an ogre. I'm not cut out for this,' Shrek tells his wife).This amusing fairy tale with major characters from great tales such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Snow White, and Captain Hook, among others, has a smart theme about being yourself despite negative attitude from others. It is carried through most of the film, starting with people's initial revulsion at seeing Shrek and not seeing his humanity to Arthur becoming king despite the 'loser' appellation given by his high school peers. The parody of a Beverly Hills high school in which girls use 'like' in every sentence with high pitched, 'Oh-my-God' voices is funny material. The opening vaudeville show, medieval style, is ingenious as is the raucous sequence in which the Shrek and Fiona struggle with their royal costumes. Of course, DreamWorks has incorporated the best possible animation production, right down to silky hair bouncing perfectly.Despite the sweeter characters in Shrek the Third and the streamlined, focused plot, I miss the torrent of pop-cult references in the first and second editions. I'm still threatening to go back to savor all the references, the ones I heard and the many I missed.But I have too many new films to see, the older ones drifting far, far away.",Null,14,35,16 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," A Drug
","'War is a drug.' Reporter Chris Hedges 'Up close and personal' describes director Kathryn Bigelow's numerous hand-held cameras, pervasive close-ups, and small number of actors in her powerful Hurt Locker. It's Baghdad, 2004; we follow non linear incidents involving a three-man bomb-detonating unit. The protagonist, Staff Sergeant William James, is aptly named if you consider the pragmatic philosophy of the great American thinker and this soldier's fearless de-fusion of IUD's. It's as If the philosopher said that war exists, and explosive devices are its lifeblood, so get over fear and fight.Along the way, soldier James also thinks of his wife and son and a young boy given up bloodily to the Iraqi insurgency. One soldier describes James as 'not very good with people, but a good warrior,' summarizing a complicated man seemingly fearless facing the enemy. The buzz on Bigelow and writer Mark Boal is that the film is apolitical, yet no visceral story about war, such as Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down, can separate itself from the idea that 'war is hell' or as I opened this review, a drug. For James, it is a hell of his choosing and an addiction that doesn't separate him from his feelings for his fellow soldiers, his family, or even his unwitting enemy symbolized by the man who begs James to take off the suicide bombs locked on him so that he can live for his four children.Bigelow's shots of the desert are dry, dusty, and vast. In one prolonged standoff with enemy in an abandoned house hundreds of feet away, she slowly traces points of view and bullet trajectories, as if all were performing a ballet with death. The individual deaths, undramatically executed by faceless snipers, are more harrowing than hordes dispatched at one time.This war is no fun. But it is a way of life for James, as it was for so many warriors who voluntarily returned to battle. Go figure.",Null,0,2,5 August 2009
No Man's Land," The struggle in the former Yugoslavia in 1993 never looked clearer or more devastating than in this little morality play of a movie.
","The struggle in the former Yugoslavia in 1993 never looked clearer or more devastating than in this little morality play of a movie called `No Man's Land.' Serbs and Croats find themselves caught in a dilemma-a soldier lies on a bouncing bomb; when he moves, it will explode. In comes the UN to attempt to rescue everyone, spouting inanities about the peace process when peace is an absurdity put in relief by the current puzzle.
The press is mercilessly savaged for being as self-serving as the warring factions. When the reporter asks, while the camera whirs away, how one of the 3 soldiers in the booby-trapped trench feels, he gives her a raised digit.  It's a mild rebuke considering she just exclaimed about the absurdity of war.Cinematography and set design are subdued. For a film, it is surprisingly stagy, yet that effect heightens the real war of ideas like who started it all and who cares about just one man. The doomed soldier holds a family photo unaware that to do so in the movies is to invite danger. It's funny and harrowing at the same time. `No Man's Land' is closer to `Three Kings' than it is to `Waiting for Godot' because its humor is purposely gallows-like and less existential. Yet when the camera pulls away at the end, you can be sure you have just watched the best film of the absurd for the 21st century.  `Behind Enemy Lines' or even `M*A*S*H pale next to this Cannes winner for best screenplay.",Null,0,2,7 February 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," This is one of the best films, despite its slow first hour, to study responsibility, authority, and heroism.
","Some colleges include courses, even majors, in leadership. The film `K-19: The Widowmaker' should be required viewing, as `Patton' often is, for an example of conflicted command. This is a true story of Russia's first nuclear ballistic submarine, malfunctioning in its nuclear reactor on its maiden voyage in the North Atlantic in 1961.Harrison Ford plays a cold-war Soviet U boat captain devoted to the motherland and communism.  Liam Neeson is his executive officer, devoted to the goodwill and survival of his men. The conflict is predictable; what is not easy to discern, however, is who is right or wrong.  Given that the nuclear element of the boat eventually places everyone in harm's way, it is difficult for the captain or the audience to see clearly whether or not to save the men from radiation poisoning or the world from a hydrogen-like explosion.Spiderman learned that with great power comes great responsibility. `K-19,' admirable in showing that responsibility, features a mature Harrison Ford, partly villain and partly hero in a challenging mix. No confusion, however, over his awkward Russian accent.Director Kathryn Bigelow (`Weight of Water') makes the claustrophobia palpable but bearable with a fluid and rapid camera allowing you to breathe while death stalks the ship.

X-Men: Apocalypse," The worst of the series.
","'I've been called many things over many lifetimes: Ra, Krishna, and Yahweh. I was there to spark and fan the flame of man's awakening, to spin the wheel of civilization.'Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac)Yep, we're in trouble as you can tell from that quote. Sounds almost like a power-deluded presidential candidate. I would call X-Men: Apocalypse 'absurd,' but even that dramatic genre has an element of believability, such as waiting for a god that never shows. Waiting for Apocalypse produces only a doomed demi-god from very ancient Egypt, visiting the 1980's and taking over the world. Besides the usual Hollywood fire and brimstone, this hot mess has no redeeming conceit, such as a race of mothers nursing humanity to evil. I can't tell you the special circumstance other than weeping over Apocalypse because the great actor underneath is so hidden he could be a reality TV host firing everyone who doesn't agree with him.Except for Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique in a very skin-tight costume, even the CGI is ugly, disguised under tons of smashing rocks, rocks all over, nowhere near aesthetically inspiring. The crew of X-Men is pretty much dealing with two men, the aforementioned Apocalypse and the estranged Magneto (Michael Fassbender). As in the case of James McAvoy as Xavier and Fassbender, these two superb actors pale next to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, possibly because those Shakespearean Brits brought so much gravity from so many years of living. No fault of the younger actors, who are given scant smart dialogue that abounded, for instance, in the anti-heroic Deadpool.Other marvels such as The Avengers do quite well in the character and wisecracking categories; the X men are humorless except for some attempts from younger heroes like Nightcrawler (Kodi Smitt-McPhee) and Quicksilver (Evan Peters), e.g., 'No matter how fast I run, I always seem to be too late.' A bright note is the thematic capstone declaring the key to human success, companionship:'It's over, Charles. You are beaten.' (Apocalypse) 'You'll never win.' (Xavier) 'Why not?'

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Fear being caught in a web of boredom.
","Aunt May (Sally Field): 'I once told you that secrets have a cost. The truth does too.'The truth in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is it might cost you over $10 to be bored for 142 minutes. Spidey/Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is fighting the romantic demons once again while powerful enemies are reduced to the status of playground bullies by comparison to the film's minutes. The reboot has moments of humor (Peter Parker: You want me to come down there so you can kill me? Aleksei Sytsevich: Yeah! Peter Parker: OK, I'll be right there.) but just too few. In fact, I may not review another super-hero film this summer just to avoid wasting more hours on these clichéd adventure-fantasies. Marc Webb goes nose to nose with Sam Raimi's earlier trilogy and comes off second place (notwithstanding Raimi's soporific 2007 Spider-Man 3). Although Peter's on again-off again love of Gwen (Emma Stone) is as repetitious as the rest of the film, the moment he allows her to contribute her intelligence to the downfall of Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), the film becomes charged with honest characterization—she is after all going to Oxford—whereby the old stereotype of the helpless maiden is short-circuited for a moment, but only a moment. Most of the other time she is in need of rescue or trying to break up their relationship, both motifs overwrought and tedious. By the way, Electro is a promising villain, pumped up with energy that can debilitate a city and a character from humble roots, who could have provided fascinating complexity but who ends up just getting too charged up. The special effects for Electro brimming with volts and Spidey spinning through Gotham are as to be expected, state of the art. But a good story is more than CGI—it should engage the minds of bright people gone bad, such as the heir to Oscorp, Harry (Dane DeHaan), who is the new head of the sinister corporation Peter's father worked for in genetic engineering gone wrong and where Max picked up his energy.Harry has his moments, but like Electro, he can't trump the time director Mark Webb and his writers give to the simple-minded star- crossed romance. Webb is far away from the lovely little story of troubled romance he directed in (500) Days of Summer. Maybe when DeHaan fleshes out the Green Goblin, and maybe Gwen returns, then I will be renewed, overcharged as this iteration is with mediocre romance.Peter Parker: There really is no place like home.",Null,10,22,4 May 2014
Ex Machina," They just want to be like us. Go figure.
","'I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.' Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson)Ex Machina is a thoughtful science fiction about Artificial Intelligence, whereby, to no fan's surprise, the current female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander), has human qualities that cause trouble for inventor, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), and visitor, young Caleb. If you know anything about these stories, you could write the screenplay, but you'd need these actors to make it the impressive sci-fi it is. Poets and philosophers have been intrigued by just this story about AI gone astray after interacting with humans. The Frankenstein motif is alive and dangerous, and the spirit of Spike Jonze's Her, with the seductive operating system, is very much a part of Ava's approach to Caleb. The destructive force of Nathan's creation is more subtle than in Dr. Frankenstein's creation, but menacing nevertheless: 'Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?' Ava to NathanBrainy Nathan has a compound somewhere in an Alaskan refuge as modern as could be with ID cards and glass walls and doors to give the impression of peace and transparency. Caleb is chosen to help Nathan use the Turing Test to judge the quality of the AI-human experience.As in real life, nothing is as it appears because neither Nathan nor Ava can refrain from lying. Yet, even Caleb is drawn into lies as he gets closer, even romantically, yikes! to Ava. Once again for science fiction, as soon as the robot gets to enjoy being like a human, trouble ensues. However, even if this film seems like a retread, say, of Never Let Me Go, very few filmmakers could match the ultra modern, yet still sexy, set design. And Isaac's character is so mercurial, at once comforting then tyrannical, that the film could be remembered if only for his star turn as the mad but charming scientist.After all, Ex Machina is as much about a scientist playing God as it is about the bridge between robot and man. Each topic could, and has been, treated on its own. Here it is an exciting return to modern man as god and monster:'I am God.' Nathan",Null,20,35,16 April 2015
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Baying at the moon, big time.
","'I love you. You're my only reason to stay alive.' Edward Cullen How many times can 'I can't live without you' or its variant be said in a movie? Too many when it's New Moon, the new teen tease of the Twilight Saga. I get the idea that teens long for each other much more than adults do, making teens the horniest animals on the planet. Wait. Wait. 'Animals': That's the big motif because were-wolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) substitutes for vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson), who is on vacation from Bella (Kristen Stewart). It's just another sexual frustration for her. This girl might stand a better chance in a nunnery.The slow teen romance has some of the worst dialogue this year. Bella says, for instance, 'The absence of him is everywhere I look. It is like a big hole has been punched through my chest.' While she says this, she gives her endlessly distracted look, the one that says how difficult life is for a teen with two wild hunks pursuing her.When the teens are not mooning in the second half, there is some satisfactory action as Jacob and his shirtless boys turn into very big wolves. In fact, so many shirtless boys and no scantily-clad girls leave me to suspect a homo erotic sub theme. Do girls really want to date gay men?Would that there were a lusty gay leitmotif, for then it would have saved me from a film whose first half is so slow I began thinking about The Fourth Kind, the most boring film of the year so far.

The Illusionist," Magic Sleights
","'And that distill'd by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion . . . .' Hecate in MacbethRomantic Vienna circa 1900, Crown Prince Leopold is too smart his lover says and Eisenheim the Illusionist may be even smarter. Director Neil Burger creates an entertaining and rich tapestry of sets and costumes to enhance the heavily woven plot that pits star-crossed lovers from different classes and thrusts the chief of police squarely between the crown and the magic. Phillip Glass's minimalist music is an effective counterpoint to the intricate décor.When Eisenheim (Edward Norton) entertains the prince (Rufus Sewall), not only is the first half of the film mesmerizing (literally and figuratively), but it is also charged with challenges as the prince wants to know Eisenheim's secrets, the biggest of all being Eisenheim's childhood friendship with Sophie (Jessica Biel), a renewed relationship with potential for much more.Once the film establishes the combatants, the chief (Paul Giamatti) is a referee with a growing conscience. Giamatti once again inhabits a role with bulging, darting eyes that say much more than dialog ever could. At any rate, the last half of the film devolves into intrigue telegraphed by the director, at odds with the whole theme of illusion. In effect, we know too much to keep a sense of wonder established by the early stage performances of impressive magic tricks.Lost to us as well is the innocence that made us believe all we see in film, the greatest illusionist of all time. But then, love is for some an illusion, for others a reality too hard to bear. The Illusionist shows us both sides, and we're never certain where the truth lies. But it all is fun.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The test of time.
","'My name is Benjamin Button, and I was born under unusual circumstances. While, everyone else was agin', I was getting' younger... all alone.' Living and loving: two ingredients that never grow old. Director David Fincher and writer Eric Roth in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have taken F. Scott Fitzgerald's fabulous short story and those ingredients to cook one of the best films of the year. Benjamin (Brad Pitt) is born at the end of World War I in New Orleans an old man baby and ages in reverse, a course that emphasizes the ephemeral nature of life and the importance of enduring love.Besides the cautious avoidance of sentimentality and the deft use of a narrative framing device with a daughter, Caroline (Julia Ormond), reading from a diary to her dying mother, Daisy (Cate Blanchett), about the life of Benjamin Button, this film carefully deconstructs Benjamin's lifelong devotion to Daisy as they both face their aging in opposite directions. Pitt's reserve throughout serves as a helpful defense against the arrows of misfortune bound to happen to someone in his unusual circumstance. At the same time the coolness mitigates against emotional payoff scenes with the separations inevitable for someone growing younger while those about him age and die.Quite the contrary is Blanchett's full-throttle rendition of a woman in an impossible love. Her expressive modern dancing serves as metaphor for the silent, lovely emotion that brings her daily dread of future sorrow. The dancing as motif celebrates the physical balance of their love and the nasty reality of fate waiting to cripple their love.The aging-in-reverse conceit is effective because it is really not different from the normal one we live in for our short lives. We all separate at the given time, mostly with regret that we did not have more time with the ones we love, who themselves must confront the ultimate separations of their lives. As Benjamin is fond of saying, 'Nothing lasts.''To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born and a time to die . . . .'

Wimbledon," Tennis 'love' with no points when the film is finally judged
","When the opening titles are more inventive than the film, disappointment is palpable: Director Richard Loncraine ('Richard III') can excel in the competitive titles niche, but he can't sustain the creativity for the rest of 'Wimbledon' itself. Wait, that sounds like a loser in a tennis match. And so it goes.The love affair between Wimbledon wanabees Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst 'Spider Man 2') and Peter Colt (Paul Bettany, 'Master and Commander') is as lame as some of the competitors who fatefully twist ankles and wrists giving berths to lucky rivals. That the cute meeting and subsequent passion of the protagonists should deeply affect their performances is the ludicrous subtext of a film that otherwise tries hard to give a sense of what being a tennis combatant means. When Lizzie says that 'a little fooling around can be good for your game,' we know this is a stretch for Dunst's sometimes-proper roles and a setup for failure on the court the next morning. No surprises.The interior monologue of the player as he goes for the ball, the locker room and press conferences, the complicated friendships and rivalries are interesting and insightful. Cinematographer Darius Honda provides unusual insider visuals, and while the digital images of balls in flight are both contrived and intriguing, there is art in slowing down for reflection on a game that spins when the ball is served. The presence of Chris Evert and John McEnroe for commentary adds another touch of reality during the matches. Yet, it is love on which this film spins. As William Allingham said, 'Scarcely a tear to shed/Hardly a word to say/The end of a Summer's day/Sweet love is dead.' For the romance in 'Wimbledon,' it is tennis 'love' with no points when the film is finally judged.",Null,3,5,16 September 2004
Hidden Figures," It's much more than brainy women!
","'Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line. Every time.' Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) The pre-launch action prior to the late John Glenn's epic orbit in 1962 is uniquely lensed through the points of view of three black women who, as math-based NASA computers, were instrumental in the success of the project. Hidden Figures goes beyond the romance of the history to touch on multiple cultural challenges with soft, fuzziness and smarts.On one level, this biopic hammers home the stupidity of segregation especially when it requires math genius Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) to spend 40 minutes to go to the 'colored' toilet. Well, launch honcho Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) takes care of that problem by tearing down the sign and with it the prejudice under attack in the Civil Rights Movement.Costner embodies the rational but humane spirit of NASA, which, like him, needs to get the job done regardless of social inequities, as leaders like him reach beyond computation to bigger issues like beating the Russians in the space race. His cool but caring and global instincts mirror President Kennedy's drive to succeed regardless of the civil rights turmoil.On a second level, Hidden Figures tackles the second-class citizenship of women, who despite capabilities as powerful as those of men, are excluded from meetings that would put them in charge of the rapidly-changing computations especially about the tricky re-entry going from parabolic to elliptical or the other way in a dance with death. I'm being unfairly flip because the heart of this drama is not math but the right of all humans to be equal.The premise of the film with brilliant ladies marginalized until they direct their individual fates is an apt metaphor for oppressed and undervalued people.On a third level, this entertaining drama deals with the colossal emergence of computers, in this case giant mainframe IBMS, which threaten not only our Russian competitors but also the jobs of our brilliant ladies. Have no fear, for Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) comes to the rescue as supervisor par excellence.Hidden Figures could be criticized for its lenient treatment of wrongdoers and its benign depiction of the heroines, but I prefer to think like Costner's character that we should go beyond the 'figures' to the bigger gestalt of universal equality. In this warm history, even the Russians come off well enough as experts who beat us into orbit (Yuri Gagarin).Yet, we beat them to the moon! That striving without cultural barriers is the anchor of this romantic adventure, just as riveting as any superhero blockbuster, a genre that has gone way beyond prejudice long ago and far, far away.",Null,9,29,7 January 2017
1917," Beautifully photographed, a fine companion to Paths of Glory.
","'Poor fellows shot dead are lying in all directions. Trenches, bits of equipment, clothing (probably blood-stained), ammunition, tools, caps, etc., etc., everywhere. Everywhere the same hard, grim, pitiless sign of battle and war. I have had a belly full of it.'
<ul><li>Captain James Patterson</li></ul>An Oscar spoiler? 1917 won the top Golden Globe award, and no one can complain about that, regardless of how that quirky Foreign Press decides. At the least it is one of the most moving films of the last decade; at the best its cinematography bests newly- classics like The Irishman and Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood.WWI already has its iconic trench warfare epic in Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory. 1917 equals the visual horror and claustrophobia, the animal-like scramble to survive, and it adds another personal dimension as writer-director and writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns focus on two soldiers (Dean-Charles Chapman as Lance Corporal Blake and George Mackey as Lance Corporal Schofield) commissioned to travel with a general's letter to save 1600 men doomed to be massacred by retreating Germans, who have faked retreat.The remarkably continuous shot has iconic Roger Deakins' camera snake through the trenches and into the danger of land travel and gives the sense of our accompanying, and none of the sights is pretty. The body-strewn landscape is somewhat sanitized here, but that could be because of the fabulous messenger conceit.
Although dialogue is sparse, the visceral energy of the mise en scene is incomparable. The tension is more than fear of death. It is fear that the young soldiers will not get to their comrades in time to stop them from advancing to an ambush.Although a couple of incidents along the away feel contrived to bring the drama to a more traditional level, the overall brilliance is cinema verité-a gut level dread that mirrors the horror felt by the two couriers. Their devotion to each other echoes the dedication of the armies to end the war to end all wars.You may cry at the reality of real war or at the decision to make this best movie of the year, but you will not be sorry to see one of the best film experiences of 2019.",Null,0,1,11 January 2020
Lincoln," The political process tangles with 'Honest' Abe.
","'He contained multitudes.' Walt WhitmanA story about Abraham Lincoln's 13th Amendment fight could be a snoozer in the hands of anyone else except director Steven Spielberg and actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Together they bring alive the passage of one of the nineteenth century's greatest pieces of legislation, freeing slaves for all time.While the Civil War was coming to a close after 4 bloody years in 1865, Lincoln politicked for the amendment's passage, knowing full well that if peace were obtained, the impetus for the amendment would vanish. So politics and war are inextricably tied together, and arguably the most noble American president bartered and lied his way to passage. Spielberg makes clear that sequestering the South's negotiating team until passage was crucial, if not impeachable. The drama as votes are bought or cajoled is an apt companion to the catastrophic war that cost over a half million lives. Less rewarding as drama is Lincoln's relationship with his wife, Mary (Sally Field), whose depression over the loss of her first child stalks here her lifetime and makes for some less than sweet moments on screen.But this film belongs to Lincoln, who, as memorably portrayed by Day-Lewis, is a leader of strong will peppered by a sense of humor and a relentless penchant for tales: The story of George Washington's portrait in a British water closet is a hoot. Tommy Lee Jones' Thaddeus Stevens is essential Jones: gruff, blunt, ugly, and charismatic with a dollop of kindness no better exemplified than in his final scene in his bedroom.Although this is occasionally a heavy-handed history lesson, it is my preferred way to learn. I know now what the 13th Amendment is, and I am aware in our own time of the severity of politics-- that great leaders must also be great politicians, with all the pejorative connotations our recent presidential election can conjure. Steven Spielberg brilliantly shows us that the process can be for the people and by the people and may not perish.",Null,19,34,15 November 2012
Sing Street," Delightful Musical with laughs and heart.
","'Maybe you're living in my world. I'm not living in yours. You're just material for my songs.' Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) By all measures Sing Street is just another teen-band birth in the style of the second British invasion. Difficult love, broken homes, and rebellion are plentiful. However it's not just another cliché because the sentiment is real and the tone light to make a thoroughly enjoyable musical from the pen of writer-director John Carney. His Once set the standard for reasonable romance coming from the street into our hearts.In 1985, fifteen-year old Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) switches to a Christian Brothers school because his current Jesuit school is too expensive. The ensuing chaos comes out of his posh look and a disciplinarian Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley), who bans Cosmo's brown shoes (all students are supposed to wear black). The universal truth, however, is that music will transform Cosmo's band, formed to catch fetching, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), by inviting her to act in a video for a band he has yet to form.The feckless parents and the usual bully who changes to good guy make appearances, as do the dorky but lovable band members, a motley crew to be sure. Their diversity, from diminutive dweeb to cool black keyboardist, Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), is enchanting; the creation of songs is gently witnessed, not always an element of any musical history, fact or fiction.Arguably the most endearing relationship of Cosmo's life is with his brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who could be Seth Rogan's brother. Brendan is a free spirit who has lost his chance to make it in music but has endless patience with his young brother in providing him the wisdom and means to break loose. His sincere love for his brother is a touchingly true part of an otherwise romantic dream.Mostly the musical emphasizes the mandate for talent to will its way to success, despite the counter-circumstances that keep him home and quiet his talent. London is, as usual, the promised land, even for kids from Dublin, and several times in this romance eyes look across the sea to that great island with its transforming city.Sing Street is a formula and a most enjoyable one. Filmmaker Carney will bring a tear to your eye as the young'uns break from the imprisoning world of broken homes and repressive schools to play the music of freedom.Often cited in Sing Street, 'finding happiness in sadness,' is a mantra worthy of this musical. I'm not arguing with that cliché because I had too much fun watching it play out.",Null,2,3,9 May 2016
Million Dollar Baby," A film about boxing is not really about it at all.
","A film about boxing is not really about it at all. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is more about a father Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) dealing with an estranged daughter and about the same crusty trainer facing an aggressive young female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). The intersection of Frankie's personal and professional lives is deftly drawn in the parallel plots.Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman) narrates, as Freeman does so well in Shawshank Redemption, about Frankie's boxing gym, where Freeman, a former boxer and best friend of Frankie, works and lives. Freeman has the right melancholic but authoritarian voice, the kind Michael Caine uses so well in Cider House Rules that relays acceptance of fate with a generous supply of humanity. Frank quietly endures boxers leaving him for a better chance, old age, and the importuning of young boxers who wants a chance at success. Along with Maggie comes a trailer-park family that tests Frankie's essentially peaceful nature, one nurtured by reading Gaelic.Director Eastwood's style is minimalist, essentially a three-person drama set in spare locales like the clean and uncluttered gymnasium. Although not black and white, the color film plays down color to give it a '40's film noir feeling. Cinematographer Tom Stern (chief lighting technician for Road to Perdition) uses dark and light shadows like a 16th century portrait painter. At times I thought I was watching Hopper's diner come alive with these marginal but never dull characters.While the dialogue is rarely poetic, it is muscular in its spareness, just enough to get the point across. With weathered faces like Eastwood's and taut beauty like Swank's, not much more is needed but a close-up camera and editing to reduce the fat to that muscle. When Maggie from southwest Missouri describes the life she left, the language is tough poetry: 'I might as well go back home and buy a used trailer and get a deep fryer and some Oreos.' I was drawn into the drama far more than any other film of 2004, because the story was common but powerful and the Oscar-worthy performers reached the right notes, and not a note more.

Garden State," Enjoyable and Manipulative
","Like the parkway of the same name in New Jersey, `Garden State' is not as pretty as it sounds, not as much fun as a semi-stoner film could be, but it gets you to where director/writer/star Zach Braff (TV's `Scrubbs') wants you to be-in a funky state of awareness that our purpose in life is to accept who we are and love when possible.  Andrew Largeman (Braff), like his obvious counterpart Benjamin from `The Graduate,' is lost in L.A. as a would-be-actor (He did play a retarded quarterback for a cable-TV movie) and waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant. As in Benjamin's case, most people are willing to give him advice, mostly about his limitations, but his considerable medication demands, from his psychiatrist father, kept him from focusing and being aggressive. Returning to the Garden State for his mother's funeral, Andrew meets his former life in the form of slacker high-school buddies and a father accusing him of crippling his mother.  Until he meets Sam (Natalie Portman, `Cold Mountain') nothing here makes sense either.  Then she releases, as Elaine did for Benjamin, feelings and insights foreign to him before this.  Sam is a free spirit with an out-there family, all of this just a bit too contrived to be authentic quirky, but amusingly quirky it is.  When Andrew, Sam, and gravedigger friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard, `Shattered Glass') visit an ark at the bottom of a quarry or deal with a rich buddy who invented `silent Velcro,' I was reminded of Harold visiting Maude's railroad car in `Harold and Maude,' another cult oldie aimed at renewing our love of life's oddities and life itself.Director Braff laces the film with references to death such as the burial of Sam's gerbil, and, of course his mother but manages to keep the tone light, for example, when Andrew and friends smoke weed and play spin the bottle. That admixture makes `Garden State' enjoyable and manipulative at the same time.  Hearing Simon and Garfunkel on the soundtrack confirmed my suspicion that Andrew would ultimately rebel, if not just from himself. Like Benjamin, he would like his life to be `different.'  Braff successfully underlines the difference, which promises an interesting future for his protagonist. Benjamin does not hold the same promise.  As Wordsworth said, ` Like,--but oh how different.'",Null,0,1,13 August 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Classic journalism noir
","Edward. R Murrow represents the epitome of the crusading and self-sacrificing newsman, who risked his career in the 1950's to bring down the most infamous senator of the last century, Joseph McCarthy, the junior senator from Wisconsin and the chair of the Senate Subcommitee on Investigation. McCarthy's witch hunt for 'Reds' created cowards by the score and a few heroes, Murrow one of them.Most journalism and media types hold Murrow in the highest regard, so director George Clooney's left-leaning, hero-worshiping film is not surprisingly pro Murrow and CBS. Clooney directs a monochromatic, silvery mise en scene with subtle care, using the camera to record shifts in responses through close-ups and the black and white to emphasize the era and the clash between good and evil. Hmmm, Orson Welles used similar techniques and won him immortality; there may not be in Good Night those clashing scenes in Citizen Kane that gave it such energy, but there are reflective moments showing Murrow aware of the danger in confronting a US senator, changing his glance only slightly to show emotion that would have writ large on hammier actors.Clooney as Murrow's producer, Fred Friendly, underplays a role that he could have easily taken over the top, and Frank Langella as William Paley, the president of CBS, is torn by the exigency of keeping a productive station and the idealism of bringing down a red-baiting senator. Langella effectively shows Paley not so much an idealist but rather a pragmatist who wants to support his rebellious crew but must take into consideration the survival of the station. David Strathairn's stoic Murrow is both a fine imitation and an interpretation on its own, making him a sure shot at an Oscar nomination.In a way, Good Night is a companion to The Insider, another account of CBS on the dilemma horns as Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt (also present in the current film) go after big tobacco and threaten the survival of the station. Good Night can also be seen as an allegory about repressive government capable of creating crisis when there is none and intimidating anyone not supporting their ruse. The setup for the war in Iraq quickly comes to mind as well as President Bush's 'You're either with us or against us' ultimatum.Allegory or not, Clooney has framed a classic journalism noir film in which the heroes are real and the bad guys scary. Television journalism was the big winner, for it became with Murrow a part of the checks and balances so necessary in a democracy. The heroics serve to highlight the atmosphere of fear today where such heroes are hard to find.'We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty' is a mantra for our times, echoing down the 50 years since Ed Murrow dared to proclaim it. That's heroic in any age.",Null,4,10,12 October 2005
Mulholland Drive," Take this Lynch puzzle lightly; enjoy the dream.
","Because I have a daughter and son who work in and write about Hollywood, I can say with authority that it is a workplace of monumental nightmares, now aptly represented in surreal trappings by David Lynch in `Mulholland Drive.' That is, while most of the film seems to be a dream, it is a trenchant satire of Hollywood's ability to create multiple personalities and neuroses in its stars and yet retain one enduring stereotype-the elderly, patriarchal studio head.This is a film noir wrapped in a personal vision by a leading director of the strange-if you don't believe me, revisit `Blue Velvet' and `Twin Peaks.' What is marvelous is that Lynch eviscerates Hollywood pretension while feeding its insatiable appetite for existential suicide and sex.  The lesbian love scene between the 2 female leads, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, is as sensual and provocative as I've ever seen, not that I've seen that many even in seedy hotels on lonely nights.Take this Lynch puzzle lightly; enjoy the dream.

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The power is in the details.
","There were many ways of not burdening one's conscience, of shunning responsibility, looking away, keeping mum. When the unspeakable truth of the Holocaust then became known at the end of the war, all too many of us claimed that they had not known anything about it or even suspected anything.Richard von Weizsäcker, President of West GermanyI never thought I would see the fictional equivalent of Alain Resnais' Night and Fog, the harrowing documentary that juxtaposes a current pastoral crematory site with original footage. But I've seen The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, a seemingly benign story of a German boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield), living with commandant dad (David Thewlis), clueless mom (Vera Farmiga), and emerging Nazi teenage sister (Amber Beattie) adjacent to an Auschwitz-type concentration camp, which the eight-year old initially sees as a farm. The story is powerful because it is a fiction and therefore open to interpretation and representation. As Steven Spielberg made memorable images in Schindler's List, notably the girl in red, so too does Mark Herman dot his visual narrative with images of imprisonment (latticed stairway, for instance) and flight (the boys play at being airplanes). But the most powerful images are in the face of a mother (Vera Farmiga), who slowly realizes what her husband oversees in the camp, and the eyes of the way-too-wise Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), Bruno's eight-year-old friend over the fence. The film's power is in the details such as the contrast between the well-cared for commandant's home and the starkness of the camp seen through Bruno's high windows, between the stolid loyalty of dad to the purification scheme of Hitler and the disaffection of mom coupled with Bruno's growing skepticism about the campaign against the Jews. At no point did I feel I was being preached to, but at every point I was aware of the enormous guilt the German people would eventually feel upon liberation.Because The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a fiction, it might be easy to discount its power as it stands next to Night and Fog. Nevertheless, the representational aspect of taking a microcosmic situation and applying it to the greater understanding works here. The growing awareness of the boy is parallel to Roosevelt's; the subtle ambivalence of dad as he realizes what his command will cost him personally and professionally is emblematic of any Nazi officer with a conscience. But most of all the mother's accelerating understanding of the Holocaust as she sees it in her husband is unforgettable, in no small measure thanks to Vera Farmiga's performance. However, the denouement is 'unforgettable.' I have rarely if ever seen an audience sit quietly while credits ran with just a dark background and no hint that more information would ensue. The denouement is so vivid it made me see anew the horror that was the Holocaust. Just silence on and in front of the screen. 'It makes worries like what you wear today seem stupid.'

Peter Quill (Chris Pratt)Quill, the thief among the 'Guardians' pretty much sums up the rag- tag heroes of the summer's entertaining sci-fi spoof—even if you don't take my word, believe that with several hundred million dollars of tickets, the box office champ is funny. With its tongue firmly placed in its cheek, Guardians of the Galaxy is an amusing, lighthearted take on just about any space opera you have seen, Star Wars being the touchstone for characters and laughs.It's the same-as-always wacky mission for these societal rejects— save the galaxy and they save their reputations and themselves from jail time.

The plot is so convoluted you'd need some of the computer power behind the graphics to make sense of it. But coherence is not the point— this is a summer fantasy better than most because it doesn't take itself seriously. The smart dialogue may be best expressed in this exchange:Gamora: 'And Quill...

Evil Dead," As good a scare fest as you'll see today.
","'Am I sure? Of course not! It's not a science book!' Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) If first-rate gore is your desire, look no further than the remake of Evil Dead. If you are a purist about this horror genre, having waited through the many satires since Romero's Night of the Living Dead, including Sam Raimi's campy 1981 Evil Dead and the more recent Cabin in the Woods, then stop right here. Director Fede Alvarez does it right and straight.Why not! Even to remake Evil Dead as Raimi fashioned it is foolishly to court comparison with a cult classic, a successful story of teens imprudently hanging out in a haunted cabin. In Alvarez's iteration, the zombies are lifelike and the dismemberments realistic, each with its own rationale, just as the reason this time for staying in the cabin makes some sense.Having found an ancient Book of the Dead, Eric gives the above statement, a free pass to gross us out even if the gore makes no sense or the strategies to thwart a resident evil are weak or too random to be effective. But make no mistake about the presence of shotgun and chainsaw, tropes from earlier scare fests, they are featured and used, along with very effective nail gun and ubiquitous gasoline. The special effects to make you cringe are well done, and the psychological-thematic underpinnings pretty impressive.After all, brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) did abandon sister Mia (Jane Levy) and their mother long ago, so it seems some kind of retribution is in order. Additionally, because the women in the film make more mayhem than the men, as in the current American Idol contest, misanthropy trumps misogyny perhaps to comment on the current state of feminism.'No!

8 Mile," The exhilaration of seeing and hearing young people fight with `vocabulary' rather than guns.
","Eminem is a `wonder-boy' product of the whitebread underclass of outraged, disenfranchised youths  from a bleak Detroit in ` 8 Mile.' Curtis Hanson directed `Wonder Boys' with the same sense of caring about youths emerging for better or worse into their adulthood. But the star of this film is Eminem, and although it is a fictional story about Jimmy Smith, Jr. (called `Rabbit'), it is a loose adaptation of Eminem's rise from the ghetto of Detroit, on the dividing line of the 8-mile strip separating blacks from whites.The comparison with `Rocky' is inevitable and not wholly inappropriate. In sports and rap, blacks have proven formidable.  When a white like Rocky or Eminem can emerge as a powerful force in either field, the world has to notice, and films have to record and adapt.  Eminem's astounding ability to rhyme and chant obliterates all color barriers.For a white guy like myself, the joy of `8 Mile' has nothing to do with turning up my nose at the brothers with my own white hope; rather it is the exhilaration of seeing and hearing young people fight with `vocabulary' rather than guns.  Rhyme and reason rule. The art form is important as it comments both on culture and creativity. Director Hanson said, 'I saw here an opportunity to make a serious movie about the emotional struggles of contemporary adolescents in this country. This captures the angst, insecurity, frustration and anger, search for direction and identity.'  That statement emphasizes the teenage universal search rather than the obvious power of hip-hop, to Hanson's credit. The producer, Brian Grazer, also made  `A Beautiful Mind,' another exploration of genius that transcended math in favor of the search by a gifted human being for a place to be himself.This fictional biography doesn't claim to be a definitive revelation of the difficult rise of Eminem.  It does show the inner struggle of Rabbit to break from the comfort of having a job in an auto factory, similar to Bjork's bleak plant in `Dancer in the Dark,' or striking out into creative territory dominated by blacks but promising release from the trailer park where his mother (Kim Basinger) is imprisoned. Lost in this somewhat sanitized adaptation is the angry homophobia and misogyny so characteristic of Eminem in real life.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," An echo of Shakespeare's supreme ability to focus on a single theme
","Quentin Tarantino's joy in filmmaking has been apparent from `Pulp Fiction.' Now it shines in colors, ballet, beauty, and focus as never before in `Kill Bill.' Uma Thurman embodies for him the ideals of grace and intelligence, vigor and violence, as she vengefully pursues murderers of her child and almost of herself, 4 years after being left for dead but awakening from a coma in a very bad mood.In an echo of Shakespeare's supreme ability to focus on a single theme while creating layers of sub plots and themes, as for instance in `Hamlet,' Tarantino has crafted a cornucopia of cinematic styles and genres aiming at one target: the broken line of revenge. Othello describes its path: `Till that a capable and wide revenge/ Swallow them up.'From the titles, the director shows a willingness to play with song and genre: Bad Bill is about to shoot his wounded colleague in the head while the director plays Nancy Sinatra's `Bang Bang,' as macabre and appropriate a choice as I could think of; second only to that is the whistle tune Darryl Hannah is almost dancing to-- Bernard Herrmann's `Twisted-Nerve' theme. And the violence of this title sequence reminds me of the assassinations in the director's other famously violent flick, `Reservoir Dogs.'Everyone by now knows the director is honoring the Chinese grindhouse kung-fu films of the `70's and the exciting Japanese anime films.  One of the revenge ballets is in anime style, a powerful evocation of a child's outrage at the murder of her father done in the style that transcends cartoon to accentuate the meaning in an almost surreal world. Anime was made for Tarantino.Although it is tempting to compare `Kill Bill' with `Crouching Tiger' for its martial choreography and the presence of Lucy Lieu as a villain, Tarantino goes way beyond `Tiger's' lovely violence into a nasty but beautiful world of courage and carelessness, camp and cunning.  `Kill Bill' is simply smarter than `Tiger' because it focuses on the textures of revenge, enlisting our sympathy for Uma the assassination machine while explicating the inevitability of the revenge drive.Does `Matrix' apply here? No, because Matrix confounds with an artificial complexity. `Kill Bill' never loses sight of its theme; it just pleases the audiences with the multiple cinematic ways to express it. At the beginning of a fight sequence, Lieu says to enemy Thurman, `You didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you?' To which Thurman replies, `You know, for a second there, yeah, I kinda did.' It is easy to like this movie.",Null,0,0,9 October 2003
Jurassic World," Great monsters. Great action. Great summer fun.
","'Something is wrong. They're communicating.' Barry (Omar Sy) In any other context, communication is the cornerstone of prosperity and progress, for humans anyway. But when the dinosaurs in Jurassic World are accused of communicating, it is a formula for mayhem. Control is the operative metaphor in that world, and as we're reminded more than once, complete control doesn't exist, most of all when you're playing in Mother Nature's backyard.And so another summer comes with blockbusters pandering to our primal fears of death, for surely this fourth iteration of Jurassic Park (22 years—a millennium of evolution in Hollywood terms) is a child of the others, about survival for humans and animals. The real enemy is not even our brutal inclinations but rather the corporate expansionism that promotes aggression leading to mayhem. As scientist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who has lost his humanity, says to a corporate financier (Irrfan Khan), 'You wanted scarier.' The actual word in his memo,we are reminded, was 'cooler.' Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) says, 'Every time we unveiled a new attraction, attendance has spiked.' Ain't that the truth for these summer scare-a-thons as well? Claire, a career park manager, in her perpetual high heels and self-absorbed ambition embodies the dangers of insensitivity driven by selfishness.Jurassic World makes fun of itself promoting even more exotic summer fare that begins with creating a fiercer tyrannosaurus to meet the excessive expectations of a growingly literate summer audience. 'Bigger, louder, more teeth' is the corporate mandate.Even with the multiple incidences of obvious green-screen shots and hokey setups, Jurassic World remains steadfastly respectful of Steven Spielberg's—he's exec producer here—plan since Jaws: Let the monster bond the families, who together face the ultimate fate and are better for the scare. The attack of the pterodactyls on the visitors reminds us how much Spielberg adores movies like Hitchcock's Birds.The less we see of the creatures, the more suspense we get. While we see more of raptors and rexes than Spielberg's minimalism allowed decades ago, director Colin Trevorrow keeps the emphasis on the evolution of the familial and social bonding rather than raw rapaciousness.'I can't wait to tell my mom about this!' Gray (Ty Simpkins). The boy's exclamation at seeing an enhanced T-Rex pretty much sums up my feelings about this garden variety summer blockbuster. Regardless how many CGI monsters we see, bringing back Steven Spielberg's nightmares, be they Jaws or Jurassic, appeals to the wonder of kids and the kid buried in our jaded adult hearts. Survival is still the name of the ancient game.'What do you want?' Claire asks donors-to-be. To the response, 'We want to be thrilled,' she says, 'Don't we all.' We get it delightfully in Jurassic World, summer, 2015, a long 65 million years after the dinos but alive on our screens.",Null,5,15,15 June 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Depp does delightful disdain.
","'Everything here is eatable. I'm eatable, but that, my children, is called cannibalism and it is frowned upon in most societies.' So says Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka in the new Tim Burton film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That statement is an emblem for a dark and ambivalent version of the Roald Dahl novel, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and its original film version (1971) starring Gene Wilder as Wonka. Is the film funny or cynical, eccentric or malevolent? Both probably. I'm still thinking about the answer because, while Wilder certainly showed genial and grim sides of Wonka, his sides were clear and amusing. Depp is mostly grim.Part putative pedophile Michael Jackson, shameless shock rocker Marilyn Manson, and redoubtable recluse Howard Hughes, Depp's Willy seems caught in combat with all three and no clear personality the winner. Director Burton, of course, savors the misanthropic side of Willy with nary a sympathetic character except little Charlie and his Dickensian poor but virtuous family. Depp does delightful disdain of the children, who are mostly, with the exception of Charlie, stereotypes of fat, overindulged, malicious, and fawning spoiled brats.Burton catches the current fascination with the dark childhoods of leading characters, such as Christopher Nolan's lonely Batman. The film seems to be saved from Burton's uncertain tone by the ending, which reaffirms family life, even for Willy, who can barely utter the words family or parents through most of the film. Burton emphasizes, then, the clichéd solution to misery and poverty and avoids, in deference to the novel, what might have been a promising premise, namely that not all children are redeemable and not all families can count on love to get them through tough times.Willy warns the visiting families not to touch the squirrels' nuts, another signal of the nutty film's ambivalent tone and point of view. I just wish Depp had portrayed Willy with a clearer understanding of the wit and wiliness of Wonka.",Null,1,10,15 July 2005
The Adjustment Bureau," More romance than sci-fi
","'There's much to be said for challenging fate instead of ducking behind it.' Diana TrillingFate, determinism, chance, existential choice, and love-- all need adjustment, and the sci-fi The Adjustment Bureau is right for you if you love those abstractions and miss Twilight Zone and X Files. Matt Damon gives a strong under-acted performance as a New York senatorial candidate dogged by the Adjustment Bureau under the direction of a 'chairman' who writes the life plan for specially targeted humans. His minions adjust as is necessary to the god-like's plans with as few 'ripples' as possible.Based on Philip K. Dick's short story, The Adjustment Team, it's an imaginative screenplay that takes itself not too seriously but risks being underdeveloped. What distinguishes Damon's David and his dancer-love Elise (Emily Blunt) is their determination to fulfill their serious love despite the Bureau's plans contrary to the consummation. The on-screen chemistry between Blunt and Damon is so pleasing that I am tempted to call this film a romance rather than a sci-fi thriller. Actually, what makes me so favorable is the nicely-acted romance, which asks questions about whether to choose love or public service, love or professional success. For the existentialist, these are vexing alternatives squarely in the realm of personal choice, not a bureau's design.Therein rests the philosophical core of the film: Can mankind be trusted with free will given how badly they have screwed up over the last 2000 years or so? The Bureau's notable success at intervention during the 16th through 19th centuries promises that it needs to make itself felt again, especially as the path of a future USA president must be controlled.Although I am tempted to cite the absurdities of the plot and the philosophical inconsistencies, I will refrain in favor of a pleasantly provocative tale that tries more than most other films at this time to engage our minds. The parallel to Inception is not far-fetched; the manipulation is just different. But in the end the humans must take control of their fates, and in both films they do.\Although it's not Blade Runner or Minority Report (both Dick stories), I applaud a film that dares to remind us of our determination to forge productive lives. Egyptians today are living proof of the power of free will.'If I'm not supposed to be with her, why do I feel like this?'

World Trade Center," Stone Cold
","Stone cold, that's what I call the new Oliver Stone film, World Trade Center. Taking the story of two Port Authority Police who survived, Stone manages to make the singular event of the last decade a boring made-for-TV story of two cops buried and waiting rescue, by the Marines no less. There are marks of an auteur to be sure such as the set design, just as authentic looking as when I visited ground zero after the attack. But the mark of the real Stone, one that carries the heft of his personal opinion about an event (Platoon) or his off-center look at history (JFK), is absent.Let's face it: Two cops, John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), buried beneath rubble with small talk to keep themselves alive is neither great drama nor riveting suspense when you know ahead of time they are 2 of the 20 to be saved and their dialog doesn't come close to the bite of WWII film foxhole repartee. Cutting as often as he can to the dull families in New Jersey waiting for word about their lost loved ones, Stone still fails to make even this horrific event interesting. As a matter of fact, he fails to put the event into its larger context of a world crisis that changes the way we live forever. It's a challenge to do so if you choose only a small part of the event, but a great director should be able to as Stone did, for instance, with Wall Street, where the shenanigans of one broker clearly represented a corrupt generation of self-centered consumers.It's as if Oliver Stone promised Hollywood after his disastrous Alexander (which I liked) that he'd be a good boy and not editorialize about 9/11. Heck, point of view is Stone: Remember the conspiracy theory of JFK? Google 'Loose Change' to get an introduction to 9/11 conspiracy theory and wonder why Oliver Stone couldn't have gone there rather than the straight way. Or at least part of the way.'While you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take. If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber, and beware: Awake, awake!'

Cold War," Powerful drama beautifully photographed. It's tough out there in the Cold War.
","'He mistook me for my mother and a knife showed him the difference.' Zula (Joanna Kulig)The heroine's tough words express the need for defiance in Cold War Poland. Cold War is a powerful film of dark and light, a love story set in Soviet dominated Poland, post WWII, that evokes the disjointed and desperate Poles trying to preserve their folk culture. Ironically, the Soviets watch over the songs that adjust to Soviet tastes and are obedient to its direction. In other words, the central love affair between very young Zula (Joanna Kulig) and older Wiktor Tomasz Kot) is punctuated by dislocation to Paris, return to Poland, and eventual tragedy.Despite the disorienting nature of one country taken by another, the music, authentic or not, captures the Polish rural roots while it looks to tomorrow with rock 'n roll. The lovers are torn between the motherland and modernity, doomed to physically and figuratively wander to find a home and an enduring love.The beauty of writer/director Pawel Pawlikowski's romantic drama is the couple's attempt to keep connected, for they are passionately in love. Along the way their music (she sings, he plays and conducts) and Poland's make a flawed attempt at preserving traditions and their loves. The crisp black and white is a perfect vehicle to exemplify the ambiguity of the political situation and the stark reality of the lovers' struggle to vanquish the forces aligned against their fulfillment.",Null,3,6,20 December 2018
Black Hawk Down," Besides the first 20 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan,' there may be no better film to show the reality of modern combat.
","The United States Army should use `Black Hawk Down' as a training film. After 20 minutes' viewing, a recruit would have a very good idea that being caught in a warlord-controlled Somalia town is indeed a life-threatening, bloody business. Besides the first 20 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan,' there may be no better film to show the reality of modern combat (read ducking rocket-propelled grenades-forget the old hand-to-hand stuff). Director Ridley Scott, who made his name in `Blade Runner' and `Gladiator' among other action films, should get an Oscar nomination. So should Hans Zimmer for his battle-complementary score and Slawomir Idziak, once Krzysztof Kieslowski's cinematographer, for his graceful aerial shots and broken-city images.If you know going in to `Black Hawk Down' that the US elite Delta Force lost the battle in Mogadishu that day in 1993, then watching the 2 Â½ hours is worthless after that first 20 minutes because it is all bullets and gore, no doubt realistic, but who needs it except military buffs? 
Characterization?  Forget it! Josh Hartnett as a heroic staff sergeant here had much more to do in another Jerry Bruckheimer production, the disappointing `Pearl Harbor.' He peers around broken buildings, encourages his buddies, and holds an artery for most of the film. He does, however, speak one of the only important lines when he says of the `skinnies'(the name for the starving enemy), 'Look, there are two things we can do. We can help these people or we can watch them die on CNN.' That is as close as the film comes to explaining the US presence.Sam Shepard as the beleaguered general is weathered and laconic, always watchable, but going into no new territory for the Hollywood war room officer watching on monitors as his men die in a puzzle he can't solve. Gene Hackman has been training regularly for this role.The most famous image of that fateful Mogadishu failure doesn't appear in the film: a half-naked master sergeant being dragged through the streets. Ridley Scott seems to avoid tough ironies like that, which might just help explain the US fighting to save a people who seem to hate it anyway.  Hmmm, Vietnam and Afghanistan come to my mind.  No need to worry about tackling that thorny question.  Let's get back to the Humvee-there are more rockets coming our way.",Null,0,0,12 January 2002
Prisoners," A good crime story, just not Mystic River.
","'Be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best.' Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) So you think someone can replicate the sinister Silence of the Lambs and the melodramatic Mystic River; well no one can because they are grand thrillers, fraught with suspense and depravity and peppered with audience desire for revenge.Prisoners is not pop-culturally as memorable as those chestnuts, but it is thrilling and complex like the crimes themselves. There's macabre fun if you don't demand all the holes be filled. Relax and see a good if not great crime story.Revenge in thrillers, from Death Wish to Zero Dark Thirty, ignites American audiences, perhaps from the uncertainty that they can handle all the bad guys around the world. Whatever, Prisoners gives nothing new except sterling performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (both should have Oscar nominations) and noirish cinematography from the grandmaster, Roger Deakins.Conyers, Pennsylvania's, Keller Dover and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) search for their abducted daughters, while police detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) does the footwork necessary to find them while the fathers vilify him for going too slowly. In that tension rests the film's best thematic gravity: How far will you go to find the abductor of your child? Writer Aaron Guzikowski's literary ambitions about theme are on the side of heavy handed (the symbology of the opening hunting scene and Loki's constantly blinking eyesâ€”not seeing clearly, anyone?â€” are overripe).However, the dialogue is crisp and the scene shifts are expertly timed to keep us from asking too many logistical questions.The plot twists are not as bad as some might think, and the moral ambiguity where the ends justify the means is as much about the limitations of the judicial system as it is about unadorned vengeance: The audience is torn as they consider the morality of the fathers' actions.

Silence," Scorsese will test your cinematic faith.
","'The moment you set foot in that country, you step into high danger.' Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciaran Hinds) Martin Scorsese is in constant motion about faith, with his newest film, a serious upgrade on the subjects from Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ. He explores the suffering of Jesuit father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) in 17th century Japan.It's pretty simple: The Japanese, devout Buddhists, are expunging Christians, with emphasis on Jesuit priests. Only two of those left, one Father Rod, the other Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). The latter has caved (apostatized); Rod is hanging on. Garfield is not the best choice for a dynamic hero given that Scorsese has previously used, for instance, Robert De Niro. We're hanging for almost three hours of Mel-Gibson-like torture to get remaining Christians to be apostates. Until Father Ferara re-enters to confront Fr. Rod, nothing interesting intellectually happens; it's pretty much how much you can endure watching people seared in hot water, beheaded, and whatever.Where Scorsese scores mostly is the confrontation between physical and spiritual survival. At some point, it's easy to understand how anyone of faith could disavow it given the power of torture and the uncertainty of care on the part of Jesus.If Scorsese is also commenting on the current state of water boarding, because there is a mash up of crucifixion and drowning, then he succeeds in making the argument that torture is effective. But believe me, this film tackles the effects of pain and not the nuances of faith or why anyone would sacrifice lives for a dream of heaven unsubstantiated by scientific truths.Secondarily, Silence is not silent on the clash between cultures, which pits a deeply ingrained religion against an invading one. Japan is likened to a swamp that cannot support roots, i.e., a foreign religion like Catholicism. As it turns out in old Japan, it can't.As for the rest of us, no one of faith can escape the lingering doubts: 'I pray but I am lost. Am I just praying to silence?'

Logan," The greatest adventure of all.
","'Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.' Logan (Hugh Jackman)God is allowing us to enjoy the last in the X-Men /Wolverine cycle with Hugh Jackman having endured 17 years of pumping up to give adolescent males a reason to get up for the demands of an unforgiving world. However, this film, Logan, is not all blood and guts—it presents an aging hero coming to terms with the natural degeneration of his greatness and his legacy.It's really all about how these mutants, who clearly represent the fringes of society with odd residents marginalized by the homogeneity of the world. Inevitability hangs over this substantial hero saga, especially an iteration that suggests what even super heroes long for— immortality through lineage or enduring philosophy. As the founder of the mutant school, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), tells it to Wolverine: 'This is what life looks like: people love each other. You should take a moment . . . .' The film is suffused with a sense of the importance of family, not just Logan and his daughter, Laura (Dafne Keen), but also the new generation of mutants who must band together to survive.The heroism turns on love rather than technology. The love is familial, in this case Logan discovering his daughter then sacrificing his safety to escort her to Eden, a place with other child mutants, who must hide from the dark forces bent on using them as soldiers. Although such bonding is the stuff of cliché, this film makes the growing love and sacrifice believable.In the end, the search has been to discover what it's like to live and love normally. Albeit briefly. Amidst the sturm and drang of violent, bloody super hero films, and this one has as much violence as any other, the discovery of homely love is the greatest adventure of all.",Null,1,4,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," It's like an overstuffed turkey but a tasty one!
","'Eugene O'Neill long.' Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) about an active Avengers' dayThe bad news is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is not only long (141 min.) but also overstuffed like thanksgiving turkey that keeps giving until you can't take it anymore. Yet, the film is filling, that is, filled with explosive set pieces and characters aplenty. If any summer hero movie could have been split in two or three, this one could.The good news is that it is fun, as always. Writer-director Joss Whedon has peppered the dialogue with smarts, like the above quote (I just sat through an O'Neill play, so I get it) and when Stark describes their challenge: 'This is going to be like finding a needle in the world's biggest haystack... fortunately, I brought a magnet!' It's not that quips have been absent from other Marvel hero flicks, it's just that this iteration is filled with them. Unfortunately they are sometimes lost among the loud ubiquitous explosions.I understand the need to appeal to young males and therefore to load the sci-fi thriller with testosterone, but this much is a loss for the more humanistic elements such as the intriguing love affair between the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Consider also the fascinating youngsters, twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who have powers capable of subduing the Avengers. So much story waiting in so many characters yet so much fighting.Having just enjoyed Ex Machina, about artificial intelligence, I was pleased that beyond the special effects in Avengers lies a treatise on the dangers of man playing God, a lesson we have not learned from Frankenstein to 2001 to this film. Yet, something is there to be enjoyed when we can be cautioned about our pride through art.So enjoy the first blockbuster of the summer.

Big Fish," You may be ready to understand your parents better than you thought possible.
","A fable about a fabulist told by a fabled director.  Tim Burton's `Big Fish' is an imaginative rendering of children's universal longing to know their parents fully before the final separation.   Equally as important to anyone who tells stories, like creative parents, writers, and directors, is the film's depiction of the complex relationship between the storyteller and the audience. Burton carries both themes in his characteristically flamboyant (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Batman') style that includes fairytales and outright magic realism. `The Wizard of Oz,' `Fisher King,' and `Princess Bride' come immediately to mind of other American films that have succeeded in a genre perfected by Latin artists.Storyteller Edward (Albert Finney) is on his deathbed.  His son, Will (Billy Crudup), who long ago discarded his dad's fabulous stories and his dad, now tries to understand who his dad is underneath those lies by questioning dad and searching family history for clues.  The magical scenes of dad's meeting a giant and tree monsters in a forest, and conjoined singers at a Red Army talent show, experiencing an unreal but perfect town called Specter, and getting involved with a bizarre circus are successfully rendered by a director whose dark but lyrical side is well documented (`Nightmare Before Christmas, ` `Sleepy Hollow'). The question about the truth of the stories becomes academic because son must meet dad on his fabulous terms or forever hold his peace.As Ewan McGregor (the young Edward) did in `Moulin Rouge,' he can walk between innocence and experience as well as any actor today.  Albert Finney's Southern accent from his British mouth is flawless, just like his uncompromising take on a father whose tall tales demand respect for the wisdom they offer and the truth that may lurk underneath them. On the level that requires a dÃ©tente between father and son, Burton marvelously takes no sides: When father asks son who he wants him to be, the melancholic truths that father may have hidden behind his stories all his life are balanced by the need for a son to accept a father on his terms, not the son's.Burton is far less clear on the matter of the storyteller's relationship to the audience.  It seems that if the listener suspends disbelief, the story will enrich the present and future with meanings heretofore hidden by the dull demands of the quotidian. A story about an elusive `big fish' becomes more than a child's fish tale; it reveals truths about ambition and cunning and generosity, with a subtle comment on the sanctity of marriage (a marriage ring is prominent, not far from the figurative subtext of  `Lord of the Rings').Even Burton's choice of actors underscores the conjunction of real and unreal: the actors in the different eras of the family's life look remarkably like their young or old characters, an uncanny touch to test our skepticism about all the tales. What's real and what is not matters little when you confront a parent you have never understood or a story you are struggling to tell.  Homer's Odysseus travels to the world of giants and sea creatures as well in what turns out to be a journey into understanding himself as adventurer, storyteller, and husband.  Burton is brilliant, maybe not Homer, but for the 21st century, he is the pre-eminently fabulous storyteller.  The film's weakness of never letting us know why dad tells these endless stories can be borne only if you enjoy the tale and the journey; you may then be ready to understand your parents better than you thought possible.As Will puts it,  'In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth.'

Hotel Mumbai," Real and terrible: A modern parable of international mayhem.
","'The guest is God,' motto of the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai.Based on a series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, Hotel Mumbai captures the siege of a city besieged by gunmen doing an efficient job of killing at least 100 people and shutting down a modern metropolis. The focus is on the fabulous Taj Mahal Hotel, a fitting symbol of modern depravity for these four Pakistani Muslims bent on doing Allah's vengeance.Director Anthony Maras, along with other writer John Collee, give s personality to a few of the staff and guests: head chef Hemant Oberoi (Annpam Kher) is courage personified as he guides guests out of the mayhem; head waiter Arjun (Dev Patel) has the smarts and valor to do the same; rich American guest David (Armie Hammer) is fearless defending his family. Throughout, class distinctions between guests and staff are preserved, lending another level of accuracy.Beyond these notable participants are the other usual stereotypes such as the shady but redeemable Russian, the conscience-stricken terrorist, and the scared sister protecting David's baby. However, the use of real news footage on TVs keeps us grounded in the reality.While these formulaic victims are unavoidable in any disaster film, the filmmakers create tension by cutting between the terrorists randomly and coldly dispatching anyone in sight and the besieged hotel denizens. When David's baby cries in a closet, we fear the terrorists will hear. That's real tension, real terror.It's hard not to place ourselves in that situation and not empathize with the helpless victims and wonder what courage we would show.
Although the women too often cry and many men are cowardly, no way can you leave the theater and not be a little more aware of the vicissitudes of travel abroad and the marvel at your courageous fellow human beings.Here's a successful, scary thriller and cautionary tale: Danger is out there, no matter where you go.",Null,71,209,4 April 2019
The Dark Knight," Little to do with Ledger . . .
","'Evil is the nature of mankind.' Hawthorne's 'Young Goodman Brown' I have a strong urge to downgrade Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight to a B for BEING too long, for BEARING too many anti-climaxes, BUT it also happens to BE the best super-hero movie of the summer and one of the BEST comic book adaptations ever. This praise has little to do with Heath Ledger's memorable turn as The Joker, so good it will instantaneously make you forget Jack Nicholson's famous rendition.What really qualifies Dark Knight is the titular fulfillment: Not only does Christian Bale's Batman become dark, almost every major character goes through a dark night of the soul, except the ruleless Joker, for whom evil is a playful way of living out his days. The characters are challenged by the evil and goodness of humanity and of themselves. Like many of us, being good for these characters ironically involves personal vanity and a vulnerability to love.So ingenious is the script that at any one point, multiple good guys could be bad with the flip of a coin. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a case in point: He becomes the new Gotham hero by rounding up the usual mob suspects; he becomes a problematic warrior in the real struggle of the soul, whereby he must reconcile his inherently virtuous soul with the requisite means of fighting evil, a moral trap the Joker plays well.Dark Knight easily buddies up with Iron Man's ambiguity this summer as it pokes the audience with quandaries about the endless and tiring clash with evil (read 9/11 and the Iraq War) and the means to revenge or end the mayhem (read Neocon strategies). However if you don't wish to indulge these allegorical fancies, just enjoy cinematographer Wally Pfister's transformation of Chicago into a fantasy land almost better than a comic book's art.But the film doesn't leave the people of Gotham and presumably the audience out of the mix either, for they all must make choices from as banal as blowing up a boat to as profound as tracking down their saviors, The agent of evil, the Joker, makes believable the racking decisions he maneuvers for private citizens and public officials. In the end, they are in control of their moral choicesÂ—the joke's on them.As Joker says, 'What doesn't kill you makes you stranger.'",Null,4,9,17 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," A Shakespeare play . . .
","If not the greatest game ever played, certainly the 1913 US Open, where 20-year-old amateur Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) defeated reigning champion Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane), would have to rank in the top five. Rare it is for any amateur to win a professional tournament; for an American to take it from the defending Brit champion and another top Brit was unthinkable at the turn of the last century.Director Bill Paxton has learned a thing or two from sentimentalist Gary Ross, whose Seabiscuit (2003) is for me the most recent touchstone for all underdog, American-overcoming-odds films. Paxton doesn't miss a chance to show how difficult breaking social barriers was in both Britain and America in 1913. Only by socially powerful interventions can Ouimet play the courses on which he caddies, much less compete as a poor man and amateur in tournaments such as the US Open. But the music and sympathetic close-ups assure us that he will make it as a golfer if not as a socially equal club member.Even more sentimental is Ouimet's difficulty in dating the daughter of a prominent family and convincing his laborer father that golf is a worthy endeavor. Paxton plays all the elements too heavily at the risk of courting cliché and losing 'true story' status. Yet the pint-sized caddy Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter) with the quick aphorisms about playing and winning is an effective way of delivering humor and humanity without the sentimentality.Paxton's best effort is using special effects to help us feel the challenges of the game. Often we follow the ball as if we were riding it, careering behind it, or seeing its point of view. Sometimes a graceful swing sends the ball into the audience (Is Paxton thinking 3-D?). A few times British champion Harry Vardon surveys the crowds before his swing and thereby effaces them to gain a singularly pure view of his shot. Wimbledon (2004) also used similar effects plus voice-over of the athlete's thoughts, but that was a far less effective film.Unfortunately Paxton also has Harry seeing for too many times four dark-clad elders who had moved his family from Jersey to build a golf course. Just as annoying is cutting to Ouimet's disgruntled father as a distraction.The Greatest Game Ever Played tries, and often succeeds, in fulfilling Harold Segall's romantic description of the game: 'Golf is not just exercise; it is an adventure, a romance . . . a Shakespeare play in which disaster and comedy are intertwined (and) you have to live with the consequences of each action.'",Null,7,26,22 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Lessons learned.
","'What makes Harry and buds more interesting than ever is that they care more deeply about each other and take more time to figure out their strategies, the way intelligent adults do.' So I said about the third Harry Potter installment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I can't say that for the fifth, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which uses much elementary wizardry and too little caring, except for Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) ambivalent kiss with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), in honor of diversity, I suppose.The tone is downbeat as Harry tries to prepare the skeptics for the return of his arch enemy, Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). It may be that Harry is becoming more isolated because of his fame (newspapers pronounce him 'Harry Plotter'), distancing himself from his friends partly to shield them from collateral harm and partly from adolescent moodiness.There is little fun of the kind the Quidditch match, missing here, always provided. Harry is even opposite and distant from Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) as he is consumed by his thoughts about the return of his enemy. Happily some joy comes in a makeshift classroom, where Harry experiences the gift of inspiring teaching, his own teaching, that is.Harry's teaching antithesis is new villainess Dolores Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), whose style is to dictate theory without experience, to demand learning without reason, and to eschew practical magic in general. Her pink outfit is almost a joy in such a grey world and a nicely ironic juxtaposition to her distinctly unfeminine behavior. The splash of color is memorable and dramatically spot on.Some universals apply such as the value of going it on your own and learning well.

Into the Wild," A bit like us
","OK, I love to travel to places I don't know to connect with life's companion thrill, Nature (people being the major gift of existence). So I'm probably going to like Sean Penn's Into the Wild, which introduces us to a real-life peripatetic hero, Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsh), not an egomaniac like Werner Herzog's Timothy Treadwell, but just a brainy, 60's type hippy in love with Thoreau and decidedly not enamored of suburban life. We travel with him to his starvation death in a 'magic bus' in Alaska, all the time aware that even this Emery grad may not know why he forsakes everyone for a death march into Alaska.The strength of the film is the way Penn can indulge impressionistic inclinations by cutting frequently to small mise en scene details that represent rather than move the story. A bee pollinating a flower is a representation of Nature's endurance, a pair of rubber boots emblematic of the inelegant survival measures required to last in the northern wilderness.The weakness is those very details, gratuitous addenda indulging the director's need for recognition among the artistic elite. For me they remain the impressions of a trip well taken, where the destination is not primary and the images and people along the way everything. Hal Holbrook's Ron Franz, a lonely old man befriending Chris, speaks of the need for family just as we do in our hearts, aware of how Chris has jettisoned his flawed parents and loving sister for an idealistic exit from this world in which some of his final written words are about being 'lonely.' Jon Krakauer's best seller is served well here for those of us who long to see the landscapes his docudrama novel recreates from the hero's scribbling and his family's reminiscences, especially his sister, Carine's (Jena Malone). In the end, it's just Chris, and Penn, and us wondering if separation from society is a good thing. Penn avoids the answer and Chris's deepest motivations; he does provide a slow-moving, satisfying ramble with an engaging, self-destructive adventurer, who turns out to be a bit like us.",Null,1,2,3 October 2007
Blood Diamond," Some Indiana Jones, some Heart of Darkness
","'To tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe.' Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness In West Africa's Sierra Leone, 1999, anarchy ruled, best symbolized by civil war and diamond lust. Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond touches all the incendiary bases: towns pillaged for young boys to be recruited for rebel armies, big diamond firms manipulating the market to keep the price of diamonds high, foreign concerns such as the US walking narrowly between outrage at civil rights violations and interest in the country's vast resources such as oil, rubber, and, of course, minerals.As in this year's other cautionary slice of African history, The Last King of Scotland (about Idi Amin), Blood Diamond's Africa is ripe for maniacal dictators and white exploiters, be they international or South African. Zwick captures the ironic beauty through visually stunning landscapes juxtaposed with close up shots of poverty and mayhem, not all related to diamonds, but all certainly connected to natural riches incapable of being protected by an impoverished, illiterate citizenry.Leonardo DiCaprio's David Archer, from Zimbabwe (Rhodesia as he still calls it), deals in diamonds, a savvy young entrepreneur dedicated to gaining a 100 carat 'pink' diamond discovered by native laborer Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). Vandy needs to barter the discovery for the return of his enslaved family and a chunk of money. Archer's adventure dominates the film to the detriment of closer looks at devastating issues such as child soldiers, of which there are an estimated 200,000. Vandy's son is one of those, so Archer becomes involved by virtue of the diamond and his own emerging altruistic inclinations.Archer's budding love for Jennifer Connelly's journalist Maddy Bowen reminds me of Rick and Ilsa from Casablancalove requiring sacrifices during war, issues bigger than the two of them, blah, blah. So Blood Diamond turns on love after all, both for a land and a people. If Zwick had stayed longer with the big issues such as politics and corporate corruption, his film would have achieved an Out-of-Africa mystique. He does, however, elicit a memorable performance from DiCaprio and wakes us to the politics of diamonds. After all, romantic Americans demand 2/3 of the African diamonds, rarely asking if they are buying 'conflict-free' gems.The sometimes Indiana Jones-like Blood Diamond gives little hope there is such a commodity.",Null,7,15,3 December 2006
Elysium," It's not 2001, but it is August. Let's be thankful for a small gift.
","Elysium is a Kubrick/Clarke-like 2001 spoked wheel hovering and tormenting the L.A. underclass still suffering in the environmentally-challenged earth of 2054. Writer-director Neill Blompkamp has another gritty, chaotic future like his acclaimed District 9, only this time he hews closer to traditional sci-fi with bald political parallels to 2013 and pervasive fighting to the exclusion of the more cerebral possibilities of the intriguing premise. Put simply, the have's are flying high while the have not's are miserable in an underworld recalling the workers in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.'Cerebral' is how I would characterize Kubrick's sci-fi; 'visceral' is what I see in Blomkamp's. Like our dreams of paradise, that place must be better. In Elysium it is manifestly so: The rich have set up a gated community in the sky where all their needs are taken care of, especially medical because they can be cured immediately by their individual health-care machines and virtually live forever—not available on earth. The didactic implications of stern immigration laws on Elysium coupled with a lack of universal health care on earth provides Elysium with enough allegorical ammunition to keep three of these movies going. Alas, violence dominates as it usually does in contemporary sci-fi.Those allegorical implications are almost heavy-handed: Earth is over-populated, minorities are now the majority, and the rich have become so rich they can abandon earth and live isolated from the woes of working people and an over-burdened planet. Enter hero Max (post-apocalyptic Mad Max?), played by the durable and always intelligent Matt Damon, a good-hearted ex-thief on the right path, who needs to get to Elysium to stop his imminent death from radiation. Saddled with a desire to help the ailing daughter of a life-long friend, Frey (Alice Braga), Max has a reason to subvert the ruling class on Elysium and enfranchise him and the rest of the abandoned earth.The premise is 2001-worthy, but the execution is dominated by the old chase motif with accompanying fisticuffs that last forever. Why not, like 2001, have a few fighting apes and then an ominous monolith or two? Suspense and satisfaction don't need to rely on violence. Nor does Jodie Foster as defense secretary Delacourt need to rely on a French accent so flawed as to be distracting from her thespian excellence (remember agent Starling?)While hand-to-hand combat still seems absurd in a world where a scanning machine can cure you of what ails, even death, Blomkamp falls in to the modern CGI obsessions related to combat rather than wit. Still, this is August, and an intelligent actioner with figurative possibilities is a minor gift. I'll take it and dream of an Elysium where Oscar-worthy films appear each month, not just in December.",Null,2,4,10 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Mad as a Hatter
","'There is a place. Like no place on Earth. A land full of wonder, mystery, and danger! Some say to survive it: You need to be as mad as a hatter.' The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) More than appreciating Tim Burton's visually stunning sequel to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, I couldn't stop thinking how perfectly Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter: The infamous character is clearly disturbed but a good heart dedicated to stopping the bad heart, big-headed Red Queen, played with relish by Helena Bonham Carter. Depp is one actor who could do six impossible things before breakfast.As arguably the most versatile actor in film, Depp almost always is superior (except as Dillinger, where he underplayed the flamboyant gangster), so my thoughts run to how an actor is the embodiment of a film, in this case the eccentric Hatter as the center of imagination and iconoclasm, just what Carroll ordered for his anti-establishment cartoon lampooning Victorian society and ushering in the age of individualism.The tea party is still there with the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse) and Dormouse (Babs Windsor), but it's less whimsical and more morbid than in Carroll. Alice in Wonderland loses the original's innocence as the film moves to the unoriginal conclusion with its dragon Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee) no different from scores of other dragons in other fantasies. Even Alice's (Mia Wasikowski) heroics are derivative. As always Alan Rickman's voice has the ability to mesmerize, this time as the slow but effective blue caterpillar Absolem.Burton has put all his weird makeup and love of bizarre characters into this film, which more than any of his other fantasies such as Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride echoes the epic struggles of good and evil in most kiddie, young adult, and cheesy romances over the ages.",Null,1,4,6 March 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," Hopkins worth every million he makes
","'I might be a bit deaf, but I'm not stupid.' Burt Munro Most seniors Bert Munro's age are worried if the government will revoke their drivers' licenses. Burt Munro's biggest concern was how to get himself and his 1920 Indian Motorcycle from New Zealand to Utah's salt flats for the world land speed competition. That he gets there in 1967 and sets a record yet to be broken, over 200 mile per hour, is a fact most viewers know before the film starts, thanks to The World's Fastest Indian publicity at the recent Super Bowl and general knowledge about the 'best's' in history with this one a least known entry.Director Roger Donaldson's challenge, then, is to make Burt's character believable, lovable, and vulnerable to achieve a dramatic effect strong enough to overcome the lost surprise hook so necessary for most adventure stories. So he hires A-list actor Sir Anthony Hopkins, who is worth every million he makes by making us love his absent-minded, strong-willed racer with an accent seemingly perfect for a character not from London but from down under. Only David Lynch's 'Straight Story' could compete for pulling a winner film out of an old man's random encounters on a slow-moving road trip.Hopkins eschews flourishes of emotion and language to draw the audience into Burt's world of home-made pistons, pissing in the garden, and old-fogy lovemaking cradled in homespun aphorisms and clichés to be enjoyed from an historical overachiever who has lived more fully than almost anyone else he meets. Hopkins plays Burt loopy but brilliant and old but ambitious. Damned if Hopkins doesn't make an essentially slow picaresque seem just as fast as the record looming over Bonneville Salt Flats.The film's disadvantage is that this down home wisdom and semi-eccentric behavior sometimes seem contrived and at other times a little banal. Lucky for everyone Hopkins' blue eyes are never dull nor is his instinct to make Munro interesting even if he were not. Overall the film is successful in showing that breaking the rules should be on everyone's to-do list, especially if adventure appears an appropriate antidote to the weight of time, whose daily dose of reality seems to neuter most of the aging population.'Be wise with speed; A fool at forty is a fool indeed.'

Avatar," Worth every penny
","'I am as free as Nature first made man, Ere the base laws of servitude began, When wild in woods the noble savage ran.' John DrydenFifteen years and half a billion dollars later, writer/director James Cameron once again has invested wisely (if you thought Titanic was just good luck--not). A couple of weeks out and it already has sold a billion dollars world-wide. It is worth every penny and every moment the writer/director has given to the project.Sometime in the future, paraplegic Marine veteran Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) goes to the planet Pandora to be involved in an integration initiative with the indigenous crowd and get his legs repaired as reward. Such imperialism means these invaders never heard the Star Trek prime non-integration directive or saw the recent Battle for Terra.The native Na'Vi are not happy to be invaded, and the earthlings are pressing hard to move them elsewhere to get at the valuable resources under their home. If this all sounds like our Wild West crossed with Vietnam, on an allegorical level it is. The US's wars of the 19th and 20th centuries are well represented, and the allusions to Apocalypse Now, including the Robert Duval Major Kilgore village strafing sequence, are obvious but welcome as I remembered how effectively Frances Ford Coppola captured the absurdity of war.The natives are noble savages, less Rousseau ('Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains') and more Maori while physically lean and lithe. Native histories, legends, and myths are present, from the Garden of Eden to Wounded Knee and any mono myth in between where the young are the warriors who must travel and learn about other cultures to preserve their own.The forest is a venue for religion, a pantheism that links the natives socially and spiritually. The contrast between the benign forces of Mother Nature and the technological indifference of the occupiers is not subtle. Although I can't give you the technical explanation of Cameron's graphics innovations, I can say they eclipse any blockbuster CGI I have seen so far. Soaring reptiles and magical horses carrying heroes to their fate and forest behemoths in the service of the natives are but a few of the delights in Cameron's first reel of his unreality.As the clichéd story of bitter invasion takes over, more predictable action takes over, but the characters are so attractive and the story so metaphorically accurate, the film adjusts between geeks and those who just like a rousing good story.'You are not in Kansas anymore.

Selma," Stirring tribute to The Civil Rights Movement and MLK.
","'We must March! We Must Stand up!' Dr. King Although I was very much alive in 1965 during the march on Selma and equally so for the march from there to Montgomery, the docudrama Selma has brought them to life with a clarity I didn't have at that time. This film presents almost without prejudice the actions of Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo), Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth), and President Lyndon Baines Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) in the march for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, freeing people of color to determine their fates through enfranchisement.Director Ava DuVernay's Selma dramatizes the culture-changes through Dr. King's perspective as we listen to his lyrically-phrased speeches (modified for copyright purposes, I understand) and carefully articulated private conversations (how could anyone improve on 'the dark corners of the halls of power')? Although much of his private speech has the unreal ring of grandstanding, notwithstanding his great gift of oratory, the film portrays a leader at the peak of his creative and leadership gifts, with a hint of fatalism that plays subtly with our historical knowledge of his assassination. He has just won the Nobel Peace Prize but is far away from peace.This docudrama also touches on the challenges for his marriage to Coretta Scott King, mostly referring to the demands that were compromising his status, not just through the FBI's attempts to undermine it but also his well-known affairs, barely referenced here. Although I care not a bit about his personal life, his success as the premiere civil rights leader was made vulnerable by his indiscretions and should have been addressed, just as any current biography of JFK should address his infidelities.The lead performances, starting with David Oyelowo as MLK, are first rate. The film takes a slow, deliberate, and wholly informative journey through King's civil rights days, thereby making a most accessible docudrama out of a most insane time.",Null,1,5,10 January 2015
La La Land," Arguably the best film of 2016
","'This is the dream! It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting! 'Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) Sebastian, a jazz pianist with ambitions to start his own club in LA, pretty much sums up the thematic heft of La La Land, a contemporary musical that evokes the golden age of Hollywood. Together with Mia (Emma Stone), who aspires to be an actress and playwright, the two embody the dreams of young people then and now, crystallized in Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with Gene Kelly thrown in for good measure.The opening musical number sets the joyous mood by breaking into song and dance during one of the monumental LA traffic delays on 405. It's choreographed with eye opening color and mirth, an appropriate antidote to LA's notorious torture chamber. However, all is not sunny Hollywood, for the dramatic arc takes us through the difficult times this radiant couple must endure while pursuing love in a loveless land.This joy and sorrow is directed by Whiplash's brilliant director-writer, Damien Chazelle, whose devotion to the spirit of '40's and '50's Hollywood dream factory is matched by his willingness to portray its vicissitudes and not end just the way you would have expected. The integrity of this film lies in his showing the power of ambition and the unwavering sacrifice to fulfill it.Besides Chazelle, the success of this winner lies at the feet of Stone and Gosling, whose song and dance are not perfect, all the better, but so romantic that it is hard to believe they are not professional musical actors, and maybe more to the point, not romantically involved. Yes, their chemistry is that good.La La Land has already received wide acclaim, and rightfully so. It refreshes the musical genre of old Hollywood, and it reminds us 'we are such stuff as dreams are made on.'",Null,2,7,22 December 2016
Super 8," Right at home
","Audiences will feel right at home in director J.J. Abrams' and producer Steven Spielberg's Super 8, an homage to Abrams' Cloverfield with its found footage motif and to many of Spielberg's child-like, home-driven imaginative films such as E.T.Summer action doesn't get much better as adolescents like Elle Fanning struggle against the army, aliens, and parents who just don't get it. The cinematography is Abrams worthy, action dominant but with the camera frequently at a distance that allows full appreciation, rather than claustrophobia. The team of adolescent buddies filming a zombie movie can't be anything but Spielberg as an enterprising young filmmaker.That team witnesses and films a horrific train accident that is not your garden variety disaster: it carries inside it strange Rubik's Cube objects and the hint of alien life that gives life to what could have been a standard teen alienation-from-parents story.As in several of Spielberg's film, getting home, be it kids reconciling with parents or aliens trying to leave, is the central motif along with the splendor of fighting the teen age monsters within and growing up amid disaster. In Super 8, the teens' comic relief is regular and sophisticated, the interaction with parents and other authority figures just mature enough to keep respect flowing both ways.Summer is reaching its peak, the skies are full of stars, and motion pictures will offer relief from the heat as well as, in the case of Super 8, a fun action film that will make you remember other sci-fi but acknowledge that the Abrams/Spielberg team does it all better than anyone else could do.",Null,0,0,20 June 2011
The Last Samurai," `The Last Samurai' is formulaic epic.
","`The Last Samurai' is formulaic epic: exotic location, historical shift in culture (Japan on the brink of modernism), a singular hero tested to the max, and warfare on a grand scale. Add grand cinematography with over 21/2 hours of screen time, and you have a Hollywood epic.What you do not have is a credible performance by Tom Cruise in the titular role. He's athletic enough to play a soldier of fortune but not mature enough to play a Civil-War-weary Captain facing combat with what may be the last natural fighting machine in Japan, the Samurai.  I break no rules of critical propriety to tell you that after being captured by the Samurai, Cruise assimilates, much as Kevin Costner's Lt. Dunbar did in `Dances with Wolves,' facing the dilemma of fighting his own country to defend his new family.John Toll's (`Vanilla Sky') cinematography of New Zealand and Japan is sumptuous; the Japanese Samurai clan is as dignified as Chow Yun Fat's in `Crouching Tiger'; and the mainstream Japanese and post-war American profiteers and soldiers, enlisted by the Japanese to squelch the Samurai, are as stereotyped as you could expect from Hollywood.  There is enough sword fighting to make you long for the wide-open spaces of `Tora! Tora! Tora!' enough silly glances between Cruise and a Japanese widow to make you long for the mirth in `Teahouse of the August Moon,' and enough trite dialogue to make you long for the wit of `Bridge on the River Kwai.'
Director Edward Zwick (`Glory') may have been influenced by Kurosawa's `Seven Samurai' but still follows technical and thematic clichés while producer Cruise makes a middling top-gun shogun. Too bad because the contemporary parallels about messing on a global scale with other countries and integrating on a personal one hold promise worthy of a true epic.",Null,0,0,4 December 2003

Snowden," It's real, and its exciting, and it's Oliver Stone.
","'The modern battlefield is everywhere.' Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans) The most celebrated whistle blower in history, Ed Snowden, is played as an introverted egghead by the accomplished actor, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, directed in Snowden by the accomplished Oliver Stone. Less subjective than Stone's JFK, this fascinating docudrama seems spot on, especially if a viewer has seen the well-done documentary on the same subject, Citizenfour (2014).In this dramatic rendition of the events leading to Snowden's being accused of espionage by the US for revealing the bulk surveillance of American citizens by the NSA, Snowden is resolute exposing the violation of the Fourth Amendment while he acknowledges the cost to him and his loved ones. Except for an over-the-top, slightly sinister CIA instructor, Corbin O'Brian, characters are realistic and under played, not always characteristic of an Oliver Stone film.Although Edward Snowden has the low-key personality of Sully Sullenberger of the United Airlines Hudson River landing, like Clint Eastwood's docudrama Sully, there is something strong and heroic in what they do, both ending up saving life and liberty for American citizens. As with Sully's wife, Snowden has the requisite suffering lover, in this case Lindsay (Shailine Woodley), but this time the footage spent with the lover makes sense to show Snowden's humanity and the difficult choice he must make.After all, a posh job in Hawaii and a beautiful lover would make any man pause before he upended his life to preserve the personal freedom of his fellow Americans. Bur Stone gently lets the audience identify with the heroics and makes a 2 ¼ hour film seem both short if you like the intrigue and long if you don't like the love scenes. It could be argued that the film is too long, but given that limitation, it works like an exciting spy story whose ending we know but whose innards we happily experience for the first time.Unlike Stone's previous head bangers, Snowden gently lets you decide if Edward Snowden is patriot or traitor.",Null,2,9,21 September 2016
Woman in Gold," Part thriller and part travelogue--it's worth the trip.
","'Because people forget, you see. And then, of course, there's justice.' Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) Keeping true to the memory of Holocaust victims and seeking the rightful return of art stolen are the driving forces of the pleasant Woman in Gold. The titular Klimt painting, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, formerly hanging in the Austrian State Gallery in Vienna, is the object of Maria Altmann's (Mirren) legal case against Austria based on her family's ownership and the Nazi's theft. The film is part low-key thriller and part modest travelogue (Vienna is now firmly on my bucket list), a smarter version of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel franchise, if you will.As in the recent biopic, Mr. Turner, about the great British landscape artist, this film also gets its energy from a painter's world-class vibe. Whereas the Turner biopic, as interpreted brilliantly by Mike Leigh, gives insight into the painter, Woman in Gold is more interested in the legal work that leads to a visit to the Supreme Court and back to Austria.Director Simon Curtis relies frequently on emotional music and the cool Maria to give a sense of the grand painting frequently referred to as 'the Mona Lisa of Austria.' A few expressive lines such as the opener to this essay are far too few given that a world-class painting should inspire many impressions and impassioned descriptions and interpretations. Maria sees mainly her Aunt while the world can see an entire era and country in her Aunt's necklace alone: 'People see a masterpiece by one of Austria's finest artists,' Maria says of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, 'but I see my aunt.' Granted the true-life story as it tumbles from the painting is interesting enough, but the figurative possibilities are never explored. Yet the rewards are still there including Mirren's classy, relatively restrained performance and Ryan Reynolds' nerdy attorney, Randol Schoenberg (Grandson of Arnold). Together they present a formidable team opposing high-priced attorneys and an Austrian museum. Hooray for justice.'I have to do what I can to keep these memories alive.' Maria",Null,0,2,13 April 2015

The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A moving evocation of the terror of occupation
","'I hope this Ireland we're fighting for is worth it.' A country fighting to the death to reject the occupation by a stronger one. Iraq? Brothers turn on each other as they take sides in a bloody, irrational war? The Civil War? Neither. It is County Cork, Ireland, in the early 1920's, depicted in The Wind That Shakes the Barley, as good a primer as you will ever see on the struggle against the occupation of Great Britain that over 80 years later remains a bitter reality for Northern Ireland.Although Neil Jordan's Crying Game (1992) treats the conflict figuratively and delicately in an unconventional love story, Ken Loach's Wind deals directly with the brutality and loss, the daily humiliations and murders the Northern Irish endured before and after the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 at the hands of an amoral occupier.The photography is emerald gorgeous and low key to accentuate the ambivalence in the country and its households. Loach told Cannes, 'If you were alive at that time, it must have been an agonizing choice. There were no good people or bad people; all responses to the situation have a logic  that's the terrible dilemma.' The weakness of the film is its dogged one-sidednessIrish good, Brits bad. Similarly could the US be depicted in Iraq if the story were told only through the eyes of the Iraqis. Although Wind is based on a true story, it makes no attempt to understand or explain the occupiers. British press has loudly criticized Loach for depicting a time they have yet to sort out. Some compare him to Hitler's favorite biographer and Third Reich enabler, brilliant documentarian Leni Riefenstahl.As lead Irish character Damien (Cillian Murphy) says, 'I tried not to get into this war, and did, now I try to get out, and can't.' So too in Crying Game does the lead IRA character say to the photo of a dead British soldier, 'You should have stayed home.' As Joseph Conrad said of Congo occupation by many countries and villains, they were there 'with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe.' The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a moving evocation of the terror of occupation seen from the point of view of the occupied. But then some of the occupiers didn't seem to relish the mess either. We don't seem to have the stomach for it either.",Null,2,6,19 May 2007
Limitless," Realistic addiction
","Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) has writer's block until his problem is solved with at little pill that enables all of his brain to work, not just the usual 20%. Such is the premise of mediocre sci-fi thriller Limitless, whose title pretty much describes what someone can do under the influence.And Eddie does just that, most notably making millions in the Stock Market and attracting mob types who would like in on the game.Because we know our still Puritan culture will not let Eddie get away with this sin, we see him early on ready to commit suicide and then flashing back by his narration to the beginning of his addiction. This flashback device always disturbs me because I like an element of surprise in any story that's not a documentary. Frequently it's just a short way of telling the story.Lindy (Abbie Cornish) is the Grace Kelly blonde in and out of his life, and a thankless role at that. Robert De Niro as financier Carl Van Loon doesn't fare much better as he's given a stock good-bad business man role to be punctuated by his now well-known grimace, which works in both tragedy and comedy.The recent spate of sci-fi thrillers like Adjustment Bureau, Source Code, and Battle: Los Angeles are companion pieces to Limitless, all of which try to show how vulnerable we are to the forces that seduce us into evil. Limitless is just more realistic in its exposition of the dependency drugs can create. Eddie is hopelessly addicted although by the end of the film I'm not sure Nemesis has been properly served.Limitless is a cautionary tale about those who try to achieve with enhancements other than hard work and nurtured talent. In any case, a didactic thriller is welcome at this dead-zone time of year for movies.'While drugs do offer a relief from anxiety, their more important task is to offer the illusion of healing the split between the will and its refractory object. The resulting feeling of wholeness—no matter how willful the drugged state may appear to an outsider—there seems to be briefly and subjectively, a responsible and vigorous will.

Don't Breathe," Downright scary and inventive.
","Almost 50 years ago I was thrilled by Wait Until Dark, a horror film in which a usually demure Audrey Hepburn, playing a recently divorced blind woman, turns the tables on three thugs who invade her home. Today in Don't Breathe the tables are turned a different way: a blind man (Stephen Lang) gives as good as he gets while three young thieves try to rob his home. As for home invasion, Straw Dogs, with no blind motif, left me hoping for more of it all.Set in decaying Detroit, the thieves, Rocky (Jane Levy); Alex (Dylan Minnette); and Money (Daniel Zovatto) are themselves rotten robbers, hitting homes for which Rocky's dad's security business unwittingly supplies the keys. In this blighted neighborhood the blind man is the last holdout, although he's well equipped for trouble with his Vietnam experience, a vicious Rottweiler, and $300,000 to protect.Although nothing scary is outside the purview of the standard horror film, director Fede Alvarez and DP Pedreo Luque take the steadicam to new heights of ingenuity by tracking through the claustrophobic corridors and air ducts along with wounded thieves and the rabid dog. The bird's eye shots outside the house, rather than giving hope for relief, serve well to isolate the proceedings with nary a hope for relief for anyone in the house. The jump scares are standard horror, but somehow they feel new or at least unexpected.Most everyone in Don't Breathe gets a comeuppance, some more deserving than others. A sense of justice pervades the proceedings just like the appropriateness of the decay motif. However I want to spin the themes, even ones that comment obliquely about the war in Vietnam and urban blight, what is most important for the horror genre are scares.You may not breathe during the many scary set pieces, and as you consider their allegorical implications, you'll be glad you had the bejesus scared out of you because that's why you're there.",Null,5,13,25 August 2016
Departures," A different kind of journey.
","'Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me . . .' Emily Dickinson.Departures is the best encoffineer film I have ever seen. But then this is the only one I've ever seen. Although it is the best international film I have seen this year, it doesn't count because it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film last year (2008). Regardless, Departures will be one of the best films you will see any year. Diego (Mashiro Motoki) has lost his job as a cellist with a dissolved symphony orchestra in Tokyo and must return to his home in the suburbs to find a job to support his upbeat wife, Mika (Ryoko Hirouse). He finds one as a 'Nokanshi' or encoffineer, a professional who prepares the body for its departure into the next life. For the Japanese, this is an unspeakable job, but eventually, under the expert care of his savvy boss, Mr. Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki), Diego achieves a level of artistry he never quite reached as a cellist.Director Yojiro Takita composes his shots as if he too were an encoffineer lovingly preparing his lyrical film. Like this review, Takita begins comically, showing Diego preparing an unusual body with passionate responses from family. Yet as the film progresses and Diego struggles with the prejudice against his profession and his growing affection for it, the humor gives way to the seriousness of the subject and an implicit argument about art, individual fulfillment, and the complex relationship between the living and the dead.Anyone who finds the thought of touching a corpse revolting, much less witnessing encoffineering, should see this film to see how lovingly a dear one can be prepared and how important the ceremony can be to the family's and friends' satisfaction that the body is ready for whatever journey comprises the next stage of 'life.'I might even call this a romance as I think of Diego and his wife, and Diego as loving gatekeeper to the families and their beloveds. If you see it, you'll know why it won an Oscar and why encoffineering may be the most important departure any life-traveling family could take.",Null,0,1,7 September 2009
The Descent," No equal
","''Hey, there's something down here.'' There is no equal is to this horror film within the last few years. It's better than the terror of 2005's WolfCreek, and while not having the epic quality of 2003's 28 Days Later,it scares you with class and restraint a bit like Open Water but inside the earth. It is a distaff Deliverance (1972), every bit as macho, every bit as scary in its suggestion of human and inhuman depravity.Six British ladies go spelunking in our Appalachians. Besides the discovery that these caves have never been charted is the terrible recognition that they are not alone two miles into the adventure. As if getting lost and stuck were not horrible, the girls face a humanoid clan that finds flesh a happy meal for what must be limited cuisine at the center of the earth.Although the crew faces some pretty disastrous events before seeing the light, director Neil Marshall never allows them to degenerate into the usually ranting females of other slasher films. These are competent women (one is a med student) whom we saw in the title sequence negotiating at least a class 6 rafting river. Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) lost a daughter and husband in an auto accident after that rafting trip and faces her late husband's affair with Juno (Natalie Mendoza), so writer Marshall has built in emotional tension to complement the physical horror.The camera work is agile and the lighting realistic enough to allow the head lamps and flares to do their job yet not deprive us of creepy monster images and scary false turns. The gore is about as vivid as any I have seen recently in the slasher mode, and the monsters, while not as horrific as Alien's, are memorable for their reasonably thought-out physiognomy with useless eyes and bat-like instincts. Where these monsters came from is perhaps a story for another time, for this cave-in is story enough.",Null,0,1,4 August 2006
Jack Reacher," Cruise controls.
","'There's this guy. He's a kind of cop, at least he used to be. He doesn't care about proof, he doesn't care about the law, he only cares about what's right. He knows what I did. You can't protect me. No one can.' James Barr (Joseph Sikora) That 'kind of a cop' is Tom Cruise smartly controlling the titular Jack Reacher as he does almost every other character he has ever played. My son says he is one of the best actors of his generation, and while you may argue about that, you 'd have to say his acting chops were amply shown in Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire, and he is certainly one of the best stars of action thrillers in our time. The intelligence he displays along with the discipline of his movement makes him a hero to be applauded. After the assassination of five pedestrians by a sniper, Jack Reacher, a multitalentedexwarrior, emerges to do the heavy detective work deconstructing a gnarled plot that involves a lovely attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosemund Pike), and her DA dad, played by the always cool Richard Jenkins. She has the best line of the film when she asks Reacher/Cruise, 'Could you put on your shirt, please?' In the old-fashioned thriller paradigm, which I favor, nothing is as it seems, and writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has the right repartee to remind us of great film noir with a touch of screwball comedy. Consider the brilliance of hiring Robert Duvall to play a crusty gun dealer who figures prominently in the rowdy denouement, and also having the eccentric director Werner Herzog play a very bad guy. You'll know what I mean about 'brilliance' when you see them steal every one of their scenes. As predictable as this plot is, you are kept interested by the verbal virtuosity and the frenetic pace. Add to that formula subtle editing (Mark Stitt) and crisp cinematography (Caleb Deschanel) evoking the old black and white noir, and you have the best thriller of the season. 'You think I'm a hero? I am not a hero. And if you're smart, that scares you. Because I have nothing to lose.' Jack Reacher",Null,0,3,26 December 2012
"McFarland, USA"," A Good Family FIlm
","McFarland, USA, is Disney, USA, with a PG rating, nary a bad word, and very happy people, especially the Mexican families. Also, everyone is good looking and caring. But, you know, I like a true, uncomplicated, old- fashioned, small town story about a little team that can.In this case McFarland, CA, a densely- Mexican populated southern Cal town, gets a new coach, Jim White (Kevin Costner), who has lost his job for losing his temper (the locker room scene makes it clear he was not totally wrong in his anger). Moving his family to this poor town is not the least of his challenges: His family dislikes the move, and he needs to learn about a culture different from his white-bread background.As the newbies assimilate into this unusually happy and ultra-clean town (it is Disney after all), Jim White (now called 'Blanco') discovers their hidden athletic talent while he learns more about their open culture. They march to the State Cross-Country finals through old-fashioned hard work and an encouraging speech now and then from the coach.Along the way, director Niki Caro and Christopher Cleveland and his writing crew show the hard work Mexican kids do by getting up to work the fields, go to school, and end the day with more work in the fields. To Disney's credit, this challenge seems real, a sign of families working together for a better life. Still clean and happy.",Null,4,19,25 February 2015
Les Misérables," It's a joy.
","Jean Valjean: 'I stole a loaf of bread. My sister's child was close to death, and we were starving.' Javert: 'And you will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law!' Just as I stood at the end of the stage production of Les Miserables, I stood in my home after watching a screener copy. I was, however, concerned that I would have nothing 'critical' to say about director Tom Hooper's lush film version, filled with first-rate actors believable crowds, and singing befitting non-opera types in a people's opera. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), mayor of Paris in the first part of the 19th century, promises dying prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) to take care of her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). He has been eluding the tireless policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe), after breaking parole for the crime of stealing a loaf of bread, for which he served 19 years. It's not so much the melodrama that grabs me as the inspired music that has discernibly distinct and luscious melodies and a book that straightforwardly tells story and reveals character. Jackman, Hathaway, and Crowe are competent singers, and the better for not being opera stars, who would have compromised the Everyman feel of the musical. For an almost three hour show, Hooper and writer Claude-Michel Schonberg keep the action moving from Javert and Valjean in a battle of wits and the youths fomenting a revolution right outside the windows. For comic relief, Sacha Baron Cohen as Thénardier and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Thénardier run a comical whore house and do quite well as pickpockets. At times, their antics are so opposite the grand action outside as to be almost irritating. Les Mis was a thrill on stage; it is a joy on screen as the 19th century comes alive with the poor struggling against the rich and the noble, poor or rich, miserable.",Null,8,14,18 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A charming launch of summer blockbusters
","'Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life, is right there beside you all along.' Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) Although a clichÃ© like that shouldn't be allowed on any screen or stage, in the hands of filmmakers responsible for the amusing and sometimes serious Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it makes a sweet leitmotif that serves the large family-searching theme.Yes, this comic sci-fi is not Shakespeare or Sophocles, but it does allow classic motifs to be enclosed in wise-cracking and explosions as the Guardians return from a rousing first volume to keep the noise high along with the humanity of earth '70'sâ€”the opening sequence featuring the pop tune Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) ushers in a sound track full of blasts from that turbulent time.Central to the serious side, Peter is faced with the father he never met, appropriately named Ego, played ever so craftily and cavalierly by the durable Kurt Russell. You say you've already gone through daddy issues in summer movies, and you'd be right. However only the 1977 Star Wars with Luke, Han, and Darth is a bit ahead of the light and dark in this version.After all, James Earl Jones is all voice while Kurt Russell is all boy- man: complicated, evil, and lovable at the same time. When Peter and he face off, I actually felt the tension every man-child in the audience remembers about his dad. In true Greek tragic form, the sisters are not left out either: Gamora (Zoe Saldana) struggles with her bad-girl sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan). No, it's not classical drama, but it is at least a worthy sequel to a version of the first Guardians at which even Aristophanes would chuckle.Praise goes to director/writer James Gunn. Who spreads the love among the characters, most of whom are searching for identity or a respected reputation among a family of crew members prone to insult each other as social sport.Captain Peter does double emotional duty between his father and his unspoken love, Gamora. Fortunately Pratt, Having played the mediocre hero of the latest Jurassic Park, is low key enough an actor to do no serious damage to the demands of heavy-duty plotting, and Russell, well, is a pro at mixing the ridiculous with the sublime.But, hey, this is the beginning of summer blockbusters, where classical dramatic tropes are not usually on the menu. What is so delectable, however, is the constant rattle of ironic lines like, 'You killed my mom! And squished my Walkman!' (Peter) That's the sound of summer fun.",Null,3,7,3 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," It may turn out to be the best movie this summer.
","'The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost' secularly head for the coast as I remember American Pie reporting. The Sisters of Saint Joseph had a decidedly different take for this Catholic boy, one that brooked no argument against the divinity of the Son, Jesus Christ.So with what glee have I read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code and seen the faithful film version directed by Ron Howard. Anyone who would dare compromise the nun's version to posit Jesus marrying Mary Magdalene is an instant hero for this critically thinking, subsequently Jesuit-trained professor and film critic, whose skepticism the well-wimpled ones punished mercilessly and regularly.The film, with Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who helps unravel a centuries-old mystery about the Holy Grail and the uncelibate Christ, is a lengthy debate about the truth of the myth and the places of Opus Dei and the Knights Templar in the history of the church's violent past. Regardless of where you stand on the possibility that Christ was not divine, this film makes you interested in the debate and immediately suspicious of the Catholic Church's goodness.But that skepticism is healthy in many ways, not dangerous at all to the doctrinaire leadership in real life, yet in this film the conservative church groups fear it enough to murder in the name of the Lord. So the laity joins the priests in beating the devil at his own game. Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ dwells overly long on the physical suffering of Christ; Howard and Brown dwell too much on the thrills if the chase. As Jimmy Durante quipped, 'Everybody wants to get into the act.' The film is so faithful to the novel that the slowest part of the film, the chase after the intellectual exposition of the theory by the mesmerizing Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabling, is just as weak and it is in the novel.The Da Vinci Code may turn out to be the best movie this summer: It's faithful to the novel, intelligent in exposition, and an easy 2 1/2 hrs of intrigue. The faithful translation of Brown's provocative theories alone should please the highbrows; the thriller component should satisfy the summer sunbathers.",Null,5,14,19 May 2006
Thor," Summer is coming in.
","Thor is a powerful entry into summer comic book fantasy as director Kenneth Branagh infuses enough humanity into the CGI inter-dimensional portal travel to make a reasonable story of love and coming of age to offset the large number of combat scenes replete with exotic explosions. Having been banished to earth from the Utopian Asgard, Thor must mature from the hothead warrior to wise leader in order to win back his father's respect and qualify to replace him as king. Back home are the usual suspects of corrupt brother and the Ice Giants from the planet Jotunheim.Chris Hemsworth is a suitable Thor: handsome, muscular, otherworldly, and most importantly humorously ironic. Natalie Portman, on the other hand, has a thankless role as the infatuated astrophysicist, who can barely breathe while in his godly presence so taken she is in about 2 short days with his majesty. Happily Sir Anthony Hopkins underplays his role as Thor's king/father to give the right tone of paternal tough love. No one else in the science fiction role call can stand out because they are all merely players to the more important leaders.It's a good introduction to summer escape.",Null,0,2,6 May 2011
The Shape of Water," It's fantastic, lyrical, beautiful, and lyrical. It might get the Oscar, so SEE IT.
","'This may very well be *the* most sensitive asset ever to be housed in this facility.' Fleming (David Hewlitt)If you consider writer Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (2006), you might call him a visual genius, a poet who transcribes myth into reality. Now in his beautifully-written/directed The Shape of Water, when Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love, it's with a fish, actually a large amphibian that can love her back, and the result is sweet.That is until the government of early-sixties figures Amphibian Man a political liability and the lovers become fugitives. Undoubtedly inspired by The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), The Shape of Water is a lovely fantasy fable set in the Cold War, where a simple janitress, who is mute and an outsider like her Amphibian, struggles along with him to be accepted for the love she chooses.I'm misleading you; the exciting struggle is mostly against the narrow-minded forces of convention and authority, which see the fish as a threat to national security, but just as much inscrutable and dangerous because of being misunderstood. In that xenophobia lies the similarity to today's political climate which threatens our history of tolerance because of ignorance. Just as odd-looking foreigners threaten our way of life, so too does Amphibian Man, whose value as a specimen to be studied is compromised by foreign agents who do not wish us to benefit from research.Strickland (Michael Shannon) is the weak authorities' security guy, who doggedly pursues Amphibian out of duty as much as ideology. His glee using an early version of a stun gun on the fish is a reminder of the rabid torture sanctioned by modern 'safety' obsession.Although I have made this film out to be a sci-fi political thriller, it is even more of a love story along the lines of a thinking-person's Beauty and the Beast, far more modern and human, possibly closer to Frankenstein, whose monster in the Mary Shelly novel is almost lovable in his ignorance and yearnings. When Strickland seeks out to destroy the Amphibian and his love, he states the mantra of ill-considered radicals everywhere, even in politics: 'I deliver.' He could be Potus fulfilling a campaign promise or just plain evil. In either case, Beauty is always vulnerable and Beast, well, not meant for this 'civilized' world.",Null,21,42,14 December 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," I am happy the Wachowski brothers think enough of us to challenge our Philosophy 101 memories.
","When the action gets tough, the $400 shades adorn the heroes of `Matrix Reloaded.' It may be the Wachowski brothers (directors) telling us that everyone is in the dark about the true meaning of this second installment of the Matrix trilogy. I guess we can all agree that philosophical debates abound about choice and causality, the redemptive power of love, and traditional machines versus computer technology.  Not much time is given to any of those topics in order to jam in as many martial arts scenes and wild chases as possible.I appreciate the care the film takes entertaining us while stretching our cultural awareness with its many allusions, but I just don't get it all, and it frustrates me because I don't think depth of ideas is strength here. Hero Neo (Keanu Reeves) sometimes is Christ, meant to save the human survivors in the core of the earth; other times he is Superman (Is there something about `Reeve' that inspires actors with the same name to play that part?) saving his own hide from the multiplying Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving). Although the Heidegger, Bible, Buddha, Hesse ideas are annoying when intoned by the likes of pompous Larry Fishburne as Morpheus, I am yet happy the brothers think enough of us to challenge our Philosophy 101 memories.I can better appreciate the mythological attributions of Morpheus, Persephone, Oracle, Trinity, and Niobe. Yet in the end, I just want a good story to supersede these pretenses, and `Matrix Reloaded' doesn't seem to take me beyond the first story because I still know Neo will have a tough time saving the world.However, I also appreciate the great set pieces, for example when Neo fights the multiplying Smiths with the clear influence of `Crouching Tiger's' action director Yuen Wo Ping. It looks as if Reeves does some of the stunts-I tip my hat for once to a not particularly gifted actor. His trip to the Engineering Room is a nostalgic trip to the underworld of `Metropolis,' as giant pistons show machines' amazing strength and vulnerability. The fourteen-minute car/motorcycle/truck chase may be the most interesting segment of the whole film.The film ends with the note `To Be Concluded' (in November) and a hint that Matrix's `Architect' (Helmut Bakaltis) will return to face off with Neo, whose thoughts he claims to revise. I look forward to piecing this all together at that time.",Null,0,0,1 June 2003
The Disaster Artist," First see the Room, then Franco's brilliant docudrama about its making.
","'The Citizen Kane of bad movies' In front of the camera and behind it as director of The Disaster Artist, James Franco deserves the artistic praise his subject, Tommy Wiseau, would never receive. Wiseau produced, directed, wrote and starred in The Room, arguably the worst movie ever made.Because it's natural to be curious about the dedication and lack of talent it would take to make such a cult classic (packed at midnight in many art houses around the country), Franco has given his measure of dedication and talent to produce a first-rate biopic that sugarcoats not at all the zany set and principals producing such a risible work.Although Franco's imitation of Wiseau is sometimes too slavish, generally he catches his charmingly witless energy in the search of becoming a filmmaker. With the help of his best friend, Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), Franco and his brother make the making of The Room believable and affecting.Because, you see, although Tommy has no talent for artistic expression, he has a drive to be successful that transcends his limitations. Indeed, pursuing a dream, even while lacking the resources, is an end great in itself. Tommy is helped, coincidentally, by a mysterious fortune no one can ever trace. Yet, he uses it to fulfill his dream of being a filmmaker who creates a classic, albeit one that may be the worst ever made.He can be legitimately called the modern Ed Wood, a producer of schlock like Plan 9 from Outer Space, the reigning clunker until The Room arrived.'Why is he having sex with her bellybutton?

Mystic River," Eastwood has a classic here.
","I've worked in South Boston, the setting for Clint Eastwood's moody `Mystic River.'  His creation is tidier than I remember, yet he infuses that working-class world with an undercurrent of violence and revenge that I remember more on the surface and at least avoidable.  In this film, the sins of parents and the wrongs of childhood follow relentlessly into adulthood. Eastwood has a classic here, a piece of tragic Americana more real and stunningly poignant than `American Beauty' in its expressionism and `Deer Hunter' in its realism.Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins were all forever changed when as kids Robbins was abducted and abused for several days.  Decades later Penn's daughter is murdered and the abused Robbins emerges as a suspect. The plot details are filled with twists enough to keep interest but stretch believability for the purists not interested in slavish adherence to the novel.  Although those purists might have liked a different conclusion, and this weakness could keep `Mystic River' from immortality, they will have a hard time denying that this ensemble is the best acting this year or almost any other for that matter. Penn's determination to revenge leaves Uma Thurman from `Kill Bill' still kicking up her heels far behind him in acting chops.Sean Penn's vindictive father steps back from overacting, opting rather for the crooked lip or darting eye to telegraph his certainty that he will punish his daughter's murderer. When he says,  ''We bury our sins, and wash them clean,'' you feel he may be able to make that maxim so.  Kevin Bacon's state trooper detective is as taut as this body, unfortunately having to put up with the script silliness of his ex-wife's mute calls at unpredictable hours, Eastwood and novelist Dennis Lehane's attempt to parallel in a subplot the loss inherent in the major action. Tim Robbins' deteriorating character is a brilliant piece of understatement, which relies on baggy vacant eyes to show the hurt and anger still crying from his youth.Although Eastwood may have a more enduring classic in `Unforgiven,'  `Mystic River' is far superior to his recent `Blood Work' and Midnight in the Garden of good and Evil.' If for nothing else it will remind you how much your childhood is still in your life and how much unparalleled acting can transform a mediocre plot into the almost sublime.",Null,0,0,18 October 2003

","CONTAINS SPOILER ''I don't want to scare readers away,'' says Ron Howard, ''but the mind is almost a character in this movie.''  And he's right.  The mind of Nobel laureate John Nash is the core of this biography.  From his early days at Princeton, where he tasted intellectual defeat early, to his triumph in Stockholm, Nash, as played beautifully by Russell Crowe, goes through intense combat with his psychological demons, including an apparent slip into schizophrenia.`A Beautiful Mind' is the best exposition of the mind's ability to gyrate to a different tune since `Memento.' While the protagonist of the latter can't remember from one minute to the next, Nash is dangerously aware of every fantasy his mind can offer, including images of a flamboyant roommate, government operatives who may or may not exist, and a little girl who never grows old.The tyranny of his mind's fantasies is not solvable by any mathematical equation.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Forget the Freud-this Potter is better than the first and first-rate fantasy.
","When Prof. Dumbledore tells Harry Potter it's not ability that counts but the choices we make, I knew this series had to be more than magical cliffhangers strung together by 3 cute British private school chums.  Then magically appeared other themes to me: the importance of loyalty and family, the wages of evil, disdain of class and hierarchies, and respect for worthy elders, among others.But Chris Columbus's direction of `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' the sequel to `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' still bothers me, as if he figured only MTV quick transitions could please a young audience, with requisite action and constantly ratcheting up special effects and monsters.
Yet credit Columbus for featuring Kenneth Branagh as the foppish celebrity academician, Gilderoy Lockhart, whose lack of in-depth knowledge about his field of expertise, defense against dark arts, is a painful experience for the school chums. Branagh, long disliked in the UK, as Orson Welles was in the US, for bold and brash productions and cocky attitude, parodies himself, making me wish he'd do more films and reconcile with Emma Thompson!Comforting me in my discomfort over this episodic and slavish-to-the-original adaptation is my sense that author Rowling may have slipped the biggest phallic symbol in film history into the Secret Chamber.  Pre-teenage Harry may not be aware he has overcome the monster of puberty, but Rowling and Columbus have a very large serpent slither through tunnels that can only prefigure the maze Harry will encounter when he and Hermione finally get it on. If you don't think she will offer a challenge of monstrous proportions, then you need to return to `Monsters, Inc.' for less Freudian fare.Dumbledore's phoenix rises from its ashes, as expected; the Harry Potter series will rise also, many times over, until the current youthful generation slithers into senility amused by the warning Harry Potter films gave long ago-beware one-eyed monsters.

The Departed," Never will be 'departed' from the pantheon of premiere American directors.
","'The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated.' Shakespeare, The Winter's taleIt's not Taxi Driver or even Goodfellas, but Martin Scorsese's Departed is one of the year's best films and one of his best, after his 2 or 3 indisputable classics such as Raging Bull. The director has assembled a first-rate cast, who, right down to Jack Nicholson as mobster kingpin Frank Costello, are having a great time nudging each other's performances toward excellence through collaboration.Remade from a 2002 Hong Kong smash called Infernal Affairs, The Departed tells of moles within the Boston State Police Department and the South Boston Irish-American mob. When the director opens the film with Costello's brief narration and the Stones' Gimme Shelter for background music, we're in for a whole lot of no shelter for anyone and uncommon acting for everyone. The set up is just complex enough to act as a metaphor for the nasty workings of the United Nations, Iraqi Assembly, and US Congress. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) willingly serves as a mole in the South Boston Irish-American mob for the State Police, while Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) does the same in the State Police for the mob.Amongst the intertwining machinations of cell phones and lies is a triangle with those two operatives and a psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), as well played by the three as could be hoped for in such a trumped-up situation that provides little sexual payoff for audience voyeurs and many scratched heads for those who enjoy well-structured plots. This triangle is the only disappointment in a film layered expertly to show how intertwined crime and punishment can be in a world last laid bare by Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Mystic River (2003).Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and production designer Kristie Zea are winning collaborators with the director for a look that is authentic (I worked in South Boston for 3 years), crisp, and dark. But in the end the film belongs to the actors, chief among them DiCaprio as a young Scorsese acolyte showing the master's handiwork after 3 films with him. And Matt Damon has never been better in his hometown, as has fellow South Bostonian Mark Wahlberg in his role as a detective with a barbed tongue and equally sharp intuition.Welcome back, Martin S.

Shakespeare, The TempestGlory Road, the new film about Texas Western's astounding NCAA basketball championship in 1966 with the first all black starting lineup goes beyond the usual 'Coach Carter' nail biter about ghetto kids overcoming odds. It underscores the meanness of the culture, embodied in the benign prejudice of U of Kentucky's legendary Adolph Rupp (Jon Voight), who states in the film that five black starters couldnot beat five whites.Well, they did and Josh Lucas as Coach Don Haskins, who had previously coached only girls' high school ball, showed that determination, beyond experience, just like the players themselves, was the key ingredient in a great team. As Lucas portrays him, he is a good man with a vision, who has to overcome the ill will of his own campus toward fielding a predominantly black team as well as the poverty of a program without even recruiting money.Glory Road has no memorable lines; in fact, nothing the coach says here could have been reason for the success of the team, perhaps a deficiency in a work of art that tries to relay the truth of the excellence leading a little team to national championship. What the film does do better than most is show the cultural context as it affects the team and its individual members. Neither strident nor superficial, the film seems an honest and exciting 'inspired-by-real-events' effort to depict an era filled with heroes.The film joins other sports films depicting an unremarkable team's rise to greatness such as Remember the Titans, Miracle, and, of course, Hoosiers.

American Made," Cruise is a hot shot pilot and actor. Be entertained!
","Tom Cruise does the breezy hero better than most other actors working today. In a wholly entertaining American Made, he jauntily plays Bobby Seal, the hotshot TWA pilot who ran drugs for South American cartels and the CIA, became wealthy, and lost it all. Yet, he can be historically associated to the operation known as the Iran-Contra Affair, and in that his legacy can be certain.American Made is Seal's story, a frenetic film about a mercurial pilot, whose love of his family competes with his love of fast planes and money. Although the film may make the uncertain life playing between the government and the cartels seem romantic, the guns both running and shooting are all too real to be seductive for your normal theatergoer.Director Doug Lyman, having directed The Bourne Identity and Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, knows a thing or two about fast pace, intrigue, and the limits of idealism. Here he takes a slower pace to allow Cruise to smile and play the almost clueless jockey who is seduced into high stakes because of money, but more importantly, flying. Offered a new, spiffy, fast plane to carrying around the drugs, and this seemingly good boy goes bad.Music from the late 70's and early 80's such as Hooked on Classics and A Fifth of Beethoven keep American Made rooted in the past as we try to forget Cruise is a man of our times. Intercutting with notables like President and Mrs. Reagan brings home how near Seal was to the heart of things politic.As he explains in voice over associated with tapes he made recounting his adventures, 'I'm the gringo that always delivers.' The same could be said of Cruise, whose youthful swashbuckling has taken him from Top Gun fame to present day success.To add to the crazy heroic treatment of this character, Cruise himself flies the planes, and in one sequence puts the plane on auto to drop bags from a trap door.

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is vintage Michael Bay (remember Armageddon and Pearl Harbor) with explosions every other second, dialogue lost under the noise, and a plot so derivative you'll wonder why you're in a showing of King Kong Meets Indiana Jones.No matter, the audience loves the audacious pyrotechnics, vacuous plot, and Megan Fox in short shorts on top of a motorcycle—perfect for summer. Though not intricate, the plot is varied from Sam (Shia LeBeouf) going to college leaving behind the foxy Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Autobots landing out of a job protecting earth, and the rising of the fallen. Not one thread is deftly or deeply handled, but surprisingly in between the explosions are nuggets of humor if not lost to the noise. For example, on the college campus Sam's parents quip: Judy Witwicky: Look at this place! I feel smarter already! Can you smell that? Ron Witwicky: Yeah, it's the smell of $40,000 a year...Well, it's not great humor, but the moments of chuckles put it leagues ahead of this summer's Terminator Salvation for human interest if not depth of characterization. In addition, fleeting reference to swine flu and Obama remind us that even such a superficial sci-fi as this has hopes of greater meaning than just action. If you feel good about cars morphing into monsters, you may be the critic to see this film as an allegory about the monster car industry eating up bailout money or girl friends looking like Megan Fox dutifully waiting for college-bound nerds like Shia LaBeouf. The possibilities are endless, as are Transformer flicks, I suspect.Bay is Bay, a director who understands the taste of an action-lusting summer audience.Hey, it's summer. Lighten up and enjoy.",Null,1,4,23 June 2009
The Witch," This witch beats the Blair.
","'Evil is the nature of mankind.' Hawthorne's Young Goodman BrownHawthorne would be comfortable writing in the world of Robert Eggers' The Witch, depicting 1630 Puritans and the repression fostering that witch hunting world. (Need I mention Hester Prynne?) Sins have been committed, no doubt, and retribution seems to be the order of the day, but as in any solid horror flick like this, the evil forces are not clear, hiding as they do behind forests, quick cuts, and darkness.William (Ralph Ineson) and his family are banned by the elders for his pride, never fully explained but seemingly stemming from his willfully breaking of the communal laws or his severe interpretation of religious law. Once outside the safety of the community's walls, the family is subjected to various horrors beginning with the snatching of the newborn child.What witch snatched him, and it's never in doubt that witches are responsible, is briefly conceded to the shot of a voluptuous, ravenous female seducing teen son, Caleb (Harvey Schrimshaw). Beyond that truth lies a host of allegorical possibilities including Brown's sweeping indictment of humanity (see intro quote) with thoughts no doubt going to Adam and Eve.More possibilities lie in the teenage lust Caleb has for his beautiful teen sister, Thomason (Anya Taylor-Joy) and his brother and sister's collusion with the black goat, a sure stand in for the demon. Along with Dad's sinful pride, these sins seem waiting retribution and what better situation than this self-righteous family situated on the edge of a Hawthornean forest peopled by witches.Beyond the explication of punishment and myth, The Witch is just darn good horror filmmaking: The mise en scene has multiple little objects to carry bleak-house metaphor well, the cinematography emphasizes the dark landscape and hidden horrors, and the characters are grimly poetic enough to be holding pitchforks in front of a Gothic farmhouse.Having been a Catholic altar boy and schooled by nuns, I can vouch for the film's accurate and titillating setups for sin and guilt. This is a horror film bound to please horror geeks and novices and the rest of us sinners in between.",Null,12,31,18 February 2016
Jersey Boys," It's music to my ears!
","'Four guys under a street lamp, when it was all still ahead of us, the first time we made that sound — our sound.' Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young)It's next to impossible to compare director Clint Eastwood's entertaining Jersey Boys with the popular juke-box stage hit without feeling that the live production is superior. It could be using some of the stage cast, including the excellent John Lloyd Young as Frankie, highlights the electricity of physical presence over the celluloid mimicry. Or maybe because it seemed like a fuller musical on stage, with complete songs and less family squabbling. Or maybe because Christopher Walken's mobster, Gyp DeCarlo, is underplayed.But more to the point, this film is a story of rags to riches with the speed bumps large and disorientations many despite the transcendence of the music (Sherry Baby and Walk Like a Man are only two of the memorable hits by this unusually gifted group). Eastwood spends considerable opening capital on the home life of the Jersey boys with the overdone Sopranos accent and run-ins with local cops to the exclusion of the actual development of their famous songs.With the emergence of the Four Seasons, the musical becomes vibrant. Eastwood deftly weaves the songs into the narrative without bringing attention to just the songs. Somehow after the death of Valli's beloved but troubled daughter, My Eyes Adored You fits the distancing that fame brought to the relationship and the sadness of the loss. As Frankie moves into performances without his original group in order to pay off mob debt for his partner, Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza), the songs still evidence the greatness of the falsetto and the humanity of the singer.Eastwood builds the sentiment into the narrative arc, beginning roughly in the hood and ending sweetly at the Hall of Fame, where the reunion reminds us of their unique charm even though they are old but not out of tune. Jersey Boys may not be the fullest musical imaginable with its middlin' family life sequences, but when it breaks into song with tunes accurately fitting the times, the film becomes a testimony to Clint Eastwood's ability in any genre and the glorious sound of real humans trying to balance audience, mob, and songs. Maybe it's in the New Jersey water—someone ought to bottle it; otherwise never again will we enjoy the high-pitched romance of local boys making great music. A musical about that rarity has its challenge built into a narrative that must compete with the almost supernatural expression of music:'After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.'

Zero Dark Thirty," A great thriller and a thrilling history.
","'I'm gonna smoke everybody involved in this op, and then I'm going to kill bin Laden.' Maya (Jessica Chestain) It's challenging to think of a more wanted fugitive any time in history than Osama bin Laden. It's just as hard to think of a better thriller than Zero Dark Thirty (meaning military time, 12:30 a.m. when bin Laden was killed), Katherine Bigelow's docudrama about the decade-long search headed by the lone female CIA operative, Maya (Chastain). She tries desperately to convince the boys that she can find bin Laden by following his personal Al Qaida courier.The cool with which she amasses agent reports and fleshes out her hunch is as fascinating as the final segment where, in cinematic yet real detail, a chopper goes down but so does bin Laden. Yet her cool keeps us from knowing her in any depth, a drawback for me, who prefers fleshed out characters even in a docudrama. Then, we don't know much about anyone else in the film either.We do witness in the first third of the film some torture techniques scary to behold, including the use of water. And while it is argued that no substantial information was gleaned from these situations, Zero is, after all, a re-imagining, and the torture is instructive about warfare, regardless of where your politics come in.The last thirty minutes fulfill all expectations: Bigelow expertly shows, it would seem in real time, the Navy SEALs infiltrating the Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound. Killing women along the way to get to bin Laden is the collateral damage no one wants but must endure. Realism prevails.Certainly, the gets-you-to-talk factor is strong--strong for me especially with the distaff topic, the singularity of the female among a dominant male culture. In an inspired move, Bigelow and Boal (they won the Oscar for Hurt Locker) do not lard the film with male chauvinism; in fact I found only one reference to her not taking a lover in her assignments.Osama bin Laden is the only game Maya has played and the only one I wanted to see. I got what I wanted.",Null,8,15,13 January 2013
Crazy Heart," Bridges at his best.
","'Petition me no petitions, sir, to-day; Let other hours be set apart for business. To-day it is our pleasure to be drunk . . .' Henry Fielding, Tom Thumb, The GreatWhen a memorable performance transcends a mediocre plot, the result is a memorable role flanked by a forgettable film. Such is the case of Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, a sodden wreck of a country singer still making a living playing at bars and bowling alleys in Crazy Heart, an apt title.Not Garth Brooks or Willie Nelson, but well-known enough to be offered free booze and free ladies, 57 year old Bad is like his 30 year old pickup truck, still serviceable but ready to bust at any moment. Bridges is a believable singer/drunk, not overdoing either but pathetic enough for you to want to strangle some sense into him while he still can perform. And write songs—if he can get to them, especially at the encouragement of Tommy Sweet (a convincing, real life bad boy Colin Farrell), young country singer now flourishing partly because of Bad's good mentoring. The descent into cliché is quick as Santa Fe reporter Jane (Maggie Gyllenhaal) falls for him during an interview for her paper. She has a four-year old child—well, you can guess the rest of the film through romance and rehab but maybe not denouement. The addition of one of the producers of the film, Robert Duvall, as Bad's friend and club owner Wayne, is a welcome allusion to Duvall's Oscar performance as country singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies. Add T Bone Burnett as a song writer and producer of the film and you have a promising pedigree. Unfortunately director/writer Scott Cooper may not have caught the fire of the original novel by Thomas Cobb.I will nominate Bridges as one of the best actors of the year. That's the best I can offer you besides the New Mexico landscape and cloud dotted blue sky.

War of the Worlds," A rip-roaringly terrifying invasion tale.
","'When adverse foreigners affright my towns With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!' Shakespeare's King JohnStephen Spielberg phoned home from The Terminal, connected with his inner genius once more, and gives us an excellent remake of War of the Worlds touched with his signature obsession about family and graced with special effects that simulate the terror of invasion, as only the Iraquis and Afghans could understand.Making sure we know the bad guys are really bad (The 1953 version made the invaders a bit too cute), Spielberg wastes little time showing the tripodites destroying everything in sight with dock-worker dad Tom Cruise careering through debris like an Olympic runner, 10-year-old daughter Dakota Fanning in tow, crying too much for my taste.Parallels to America's current vulnerabilities are as abundant as they were in the cold war '50's, yet both red and blue states can claim Spielberg's support, either for listening carefully to Donald Rumsfeld's apocalyptic warnings or Ted Kennedy's rueful lamentations. Both sides can be afraid of the towering three-spindly-legged machines, like George Lucas's lumbering monsters turned into walking squid, spitting rays that just about obliterate anything. When an appendage slithers through the farmhouse where Dad and daughter hide with a whacked-out Tim Robbins (Not again! Remember him in Mystic River?), its cobra-like surveillance is even more terrifying than the giant machines. The sequence is far too long until the invaders invade the tightly framed space, at which point Spielberg is the equal of any other director who successfully exploits our claustrophobic fears.I need to spoil a bit by saying we make it through, but not because we are smarter than the invaders. What Wells, Welles, Haskin, and Spielberg, and recently George Romero in Land of the Dead, emphasize is our need to understand invasion can be deadly for all sides. In that case, the blue states triumph.No matter, this is a rip-roaringly terrifying invasion tale, told by a master filmmaker, who seems to invade every genre with child-like wonder.",Null,13,28,28 June 2005
Mudbound," Outstanding: a Grapes-of-Wrath echo with a modern sensibility.
","'Over there, I was a liberator. People lined up in the streets waiting for us. Throwing flowers and cheering. And here, I'm just another nigger pushing a plow.' Ronsel (Jason Mitchell)In the memorable Mudbound, WWII serves as background for the war going on at home, where whites still beat up on blacks like Nazis on prisoners. Two unlikely friends, Jami (Garret Hedlund) and Ronsel ,white and black, go over the pond to war, come back as heroes, but fight again against the white scourge of the KKK and hidebound Mississippi prejudice.Meanwhile, although the land is brown and the crops a challenge (The Grapes of Wrath hovers over the entire film), the black folk can sing about a better time while they fight for survival in the white man's world. Writer/director, Dee Rees, along with writer Virgil Williams, makes the blacks dignified not in a condescending way but one which allows them to act with humanity more encompassing and compassionate than the more clichéd characterizations of African Americans in recent years.A darkly photographed film, Mudbound keeps the titular color throughout, brown and subdued, just as Laura (Carey Mulligan) said in the always lyrical voiceover, 'I dreamed in brown.' A few characters give poetic impressions as an antidote to the harsh lives playing out in front of the camera.No less lyrical is the Searchers-like love between brother in law Jami and Laura. Although it's love from a distance because Jami lives in his brother Henry's (Jason Clarke) house, the two are isolated from each other like the whites and the blacks, with no encouragement even from their hearts to cross into love. This little world is just as confounded as the big one.As frequently happens in dramas about warring factions, a break occurs where the sides can meet even in the smallest way. While the film has been a downbeat testimony to race relations still explosive after the war, it also poses a hope in the end, where the big war nemesis, love, conquers, as it always will.Mudbound is a powerful evocation of the poisonous nature of slavery and racism and a testimonial to the intrepid salvation of love.",Null,1,3,20 December 2017
Love Actually," It is Grant's prime minister who finally proves to the world that `love is all around.'
","Hugh Grant can charmingly double take in any situation and make you believe he is an unwitting and innocent victim of unbearable cultural demands. In first-time director Richard Curtis's `Love Actually,' Grant is a naïve British Prime minister, a combination of Tony Blair and Jimmy Carter, with lust in his boyish heart but a value system in tact and ready to defy his urges and the president of the US, played by a randy Bill Bob Thornton, a combination of Bill Clinton and `W' Bush.This delightfully fluffy Christmas story about the pervasiveness of love in a cynical age cuts among several separate stories of people looking for love, among them a middle-aged Emma Thompson dealing with an errant husband, a loving Laura Linney in unrequited love with a co-worker hunk, and Grant attracted to a servant in his new digs at 10 Downing St.The funniest segment is Bill Nighy as aging rocker Billy Mack, pulling out all the stops for his cynical Christmas take on a national scale.But it is Grant's prime minister who finally proves to the world that `love is all around.'",Null,0,1,10 November 2003
12 Years a Slave," One of the best films of 2013
","'The aim of art, the aim of a life can only be to increase the sum of freedom and responsibility to be found in every man and in the world.' Albert CamusNo other film about slavery need be seen once you have witnessed the unforgettable 12 Years a Slave, directed by Steve McQueen with horror and grace. This adaptation, based on Solomon Northrup's Twelve Years a Slave, seems to perfectly translate the suffering and eventual triumph of African Americans in the antebellum South. Chiwetel Ejiofor as kidnapped and enslaved freeman Northrup should be Oscar nominated as well as the film and other supporting actors.As Northrup endures a thousand indignities and brutal torture in his twelve years of being kidnapped, director McQueen, with the invaluable support of lenser Sean Bobbitt's lush landscapes and writer John Ridley's ear for the telling comment, never takes the torture over the top, as Mel Gibson did in The Passion of the Christ. Northrup dangling at the end of a noose for hours with only his toes between him and eternity is more harrowing than anything Gibson dreamed up. That Solomon hanging sequence can be matched only by slave Patsey's (an impressive Lupita Nyong'o) whipping in an extended scene of at least 10 unbroken minutes.Although each set piece may have an overt message, e.g., Brad Pitt's Bass has a scene with Solomon that illuminates an enlightened Northerner's stand against slavery, the film concentrates on the personalities as well as the issues. As interesting as Solomon is representing a race wronged, Epps (Michael Fassbender), the cruel estate and slave owner, well embodies the flawed principle of ownership that drove the South's economy and its emerging loss of the slavery franchise. While Epps' misanthropy is evident, less obvious but just as vicious is his wife's (Sarah Paulson), whose Mandingo-like jealousy of her husband over his attention to slave Patsey impels her to seek an unseemly revenge on the young woman.In contrast to Bass's humanity, this couple takes the honors for horror duo of the year in one of the best films of 2013.'I don't want to survive.'

There Will Be Blood," In 2007 I have one certainty . . .
","'I hate most people. I want to earn enough money so I can get away from everyone.' Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) in There Will Be Blood.In 2007 I have one certainty: No one, but no one, can out act Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, plays a sociopath of such charisma that he evokes the ambivalence most audiences feel about Charles Foster Kane. From silver mining in 1898 to oil riches in the first quarter of the next century, Daniel tirelessly amasses fortune and loses loved ones, predictable for someone who sees people, even his own son, as a means to money, nothing else (see above quote).Director Paul Thomas Andersen's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's Oil is too long by at least a half hour, during which even the estimable Day-Lewis gets old. But it is a biography of a great entrepreneur, as much an emblem of the wildly speculative country as it is of the independent, albeit ruthless, spirit of so many of America's self-made men of the early 20th century. In a way, I suppose, There Will Be Blood owes much of its spirit to Citizen Kane in its meticulous depiction of the rise and fall of a great man as well as shots of the lonely man in his castle later on in life.And speaking of the film's shameless borrowing from movies, observe the uncanny imitation Day-Lewis does of John Huston's Noah Cross, from his peculiar voice to his careless treatment of those closest to him. Day-Lewis remains unique in his depiction of Plainview, yet his channeling of Huston is a joyful evocation of another artist and a remarkable film, Chinatown. Add to that allusion the similarity to father Walter Huston and the Treasure of the Sierra Madre and you can see how Andersen is an auteur to be reckoned with.In a year when this film will be contending with No Country for Old Men for best picture, it is interesting to note that both were shot in Marfa, Texas, where Giant was also filmed. The connection among them, the lust for wealth through oil or drugs, underscores how both commodities have served well dramatists' need to show the wages of sin (there is a strong fundamentalist sub theme in Andersen's film), for which there will be blood.",Null,6,18,14 December 2007
Joker," Oscar potential for actor and movie.
","'I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy.' Arthur Fleck aka Joker (Joaquin Phoenix)
'Joker' has many faces, the two most prominent are tragedy and comedy. The tragedy is played amid murders and childhood abuse. The comedy comes intermittently, mostly as an accompaniment to the tragedy. Both modes amply identify Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, as a misfit and psycho, for whom only murder can make him feel alive.With the exception of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, no better psychological study has come by than with Joaquin Phoenix as the troubled enemy of Batman. He may win the best-acting Oscar unless a more riveting anti-hero emerges before the end of the year.Besides Taxi Driver, another Scorsese influence shows Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a talk show host, who befriends Joker, a failed stand-up comedian. As in The King of Comedy, where De Niro's Rupert Pupkin pursues comedian Jerry Lewis, Joker 'befriends' De Niro as talk-show host. Both films are aces at showing a character on the fringe of society, in Joker's case a nut job from neglect as an orphan, who kills Bruce Wayne's parents and his own mother.To see Arthur, evolve into Joker is to watch a master actor take a nerdy a-social kid to a serial killer, a fitting antagonist for Bruce Wayne, who saw Arthur murder his parents.Beyond the physical mutation of losing a Christian Bale-like fifty pounds, Phoenix consistently uses tics and laughs to emphasize how out of the center he is. The laughing condition, occurring randomly, is an apt metaphor for his inability to tell a joke or to fit normally in society. 'I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,' Arthur whispers. It's hard to imagine he could ever feel well given he takes five different medications.As Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger showed, the joker character holds multitudes within his persona, enough for more than two hours of any film. Todd Philips directs an origin story about a psychopathic murderer who devolves along with the society he hates:

Edge of Tomorrow," Cruise controls.
","'What I am about to tell you sounds crazy. But you have to listen to me. Your very lives depend on it. You see, this isn't the first time.' Lt. Col. Bill Cage (Tom Cruise)Although Edge of Tomorrow could have felt like Source Code on steroids or living Groundhog Day over and over, it doesn't. Thanks to The Usual Suspect's writer, Christopher McQuarrie, and his colleagues, this sci-fi engages your mind with scenarios that repeat but don't get old because the film doesn't either, despite the fact that the repetitive cycling through past and present has been worked over in film ad nauseum.Cage (Tom Cruise) is a soldier in a battle against Mimics, spider- octopus-like creatures doing a successful job taking over earth. That Cage begins as a reluctant combatant is a chance for the usually heroic Cruise to play against type. As much as we dislike Cage, he retains his sense of humor and the trademark Cruise self deprecation. In other words, Cruise is the linchpin of the film's success.Yet, Emily Blunt as Rita, the global soldier-hero, commands attention next to Cruise because she's a delicate actress who steps up to a warrior role and gives some of Cruise's sense of humor companionship. More than that nuance is the low-key romance between the two warriors, a joyful all- business attitude strong and sexy in its minimalism.While the plot requires some attention, and I consider that a plus, the demons are hardly unique, and their mother source hidden on earth is nothing new in fighting screen aliens either. What saves the repetitive trope is the sardonic script and superior acting, not forgetting that the estimable Brendan Gleeson plays the stodgy general who makes sure Major Cage is Private Cage. In addition, James Herbert's (Sherlock Holmes) editing from past to present is smooth and flawless.For those of you who would like to see Cruise die multiple times, this is the film for you. For those of us who have enjoyed his knowing swagger and youthful energy, he is, in his early 50's, a film star who can.",Null,1,3,3 June 2014
Downfall," Eminently worth seeing.
","Enough has been written about Adolph Hitler, but not enough for the screen. There need be no more after you see 'The Downfall' grimly presenting the Fuhrer's last days of his life in 1945 in his bunker. Bruno Ganz is the definitive Hitler: morose, fitful, tender, murderous, and demented. Ganz not only looks like Hitler, but he also inhabits his character with passion and possibly an understanding of his premiere place in the halls of historical hooligans. (The chance that Ganz does too close an interpretation is possible for the purists.) Ganz is able at the same time to flesh out some charm and warmth without a measure of sympathy for a certifiable despot. The scene where her hires his secretary (the only one not in the bunker area), Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), has a tenderness uncharacteristic of the public tyrant. This screenplay depends partly on that secretary's memoirs.Screenwriter Bernd Eichinger provides the dialog that reveals the madness; for example: 'If the war is lost, it is immaterial if the German people survive. I will shed not one tear for them.' Eichinger adds insights about the willingness of the German people to be led by Hitler, who worked their racism and Xenophobia into a scheme of world domination only to have the world unify against them.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel guides a stunningly believable scene showing the horrible obedience to Hitler that allowed the Goebbels parents to poison their children rather than live in a 'world without National Socialism.' Magda Goebbels goes beyond Medea when she transforms her six children into corpses with a deft movement too macabre to be described in words. The softness of the children and the cool of Magda's tormented act are more than the luck of good acting; they depend on a perfect mise en scene only a director can create.Escaping Hitler but not banality, Heinrich Himmler wonders, 'When I meet Churchill, should I give the Nazi salute, or shake his hand?' Equally clueless but not without insight about the madman's character is Eva Braun, Hitler's new wife, when she says to his secretary, 'He only talks about dogs and vegetarian meals. He doesn't want anyone to see deep inside of him.' Nominated for best foreign language film of 2004 The Downfall takes us deep inside the bunker and partially into the depth of Hitler. It's not pretty there, but it is eminently worth seeing.",9,2,4,7 April 2005
Whiplash," One of the best films of the year.
","'There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.' Fletcher (J.K. Simmons)Fletcher and his uncompromising, ninja teaching methods do not include praise for pupils in Whiplash, or in any Marine squad facing a stolid drill instructor. This intense drama about a young drummer, Andrew (Miles Teller), who attends a Julliard-like music school, has the advantage of hyperbole—an abusive coach who coaxes performance beyond expectations by verbally and physically pushing his studio band to reach the best they can do.Because Teller was already a drummer before he took this part, the many shots of him drumming at a furious pace as he pursues Buddy Rich's ghost have a real feel, the bloody hands remotely suggesting a Christ-like devotion to perfection. The sacrifices demanded by Fletcher rise above the trite into a moving commentary on the challenges necessary to become great, not just in music but in life itself.When the driven Andrew must cut loose his girlfriend because he sees she'll distract him from his goal of becoming the best drummer, it is apparent that bloody hands and wounded hearts will be the constant companions in the pursuit of greatness.Writer/director Damien Chazelle and DP Charone Meir cut frequently to Andrew's blazing, bloody drummer hands to show the painful grandeur of excellence. We are only too aware that few humans are capable of such extreme passion.The core of Whiplash is the conflict between gentle nurturing (a popular learning philosophy over the last few decades) and the coaching that brooks no weakness, never admits greatness, and sometimes produces a Charlie Parker. Or Max Roach. Or Buddy Rich the apparent inspiration of Andrew's ambition. The film is dominated by Fletcher's take-no-prisoners method whereby he pushes to get performances beyond expectations.Both Simmons as the musical DI and Teller as the ambitious young musician should get Oscar nominations. Whiplash is just that: a head-turning experience.'I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success.' Andrew",Null,1,5,16 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Entertaining, over-the-top romp.
","'My name is Jordan Belfort. The year I turned 26, I made 49 million dollars which really p----d me off because it was three shy of a million a week.'For the first third of Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, I was watching the best film of the year: Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) was on the rise in the stock trading world, he brimming with enthusiasm and cunning and coached by devilish Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), a fast talking broker coach with an eye on personal profit that he makes seem almost ethical. The movie is an entertaining, over-the-top romp around the excesses of Wall Street and one of Martin Scorsese's best films.In this not quite all true story of Belfort, DiCaprio reminds me of his exuberant Frank Abignale in Catch Me if You Can, and McConaughey, well, has the third plum role for himself this year, this one the most entertaining without the gravitas of Dallas Buyers Club. Even Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's pudgy acolyte (some would say Joe Pesci to Leo's De Niro), is memorable in a role that will remind you of his turn in Moneyball but with much more attitude. Sales is the name of the game, and even the least educated has a chance given Belfort's genial coaching.Scorsese directs acting and cuts scenes expertly with the enthusiasm of a young filmmaker but the class of a lifetime of excellence. This foray into sustained comic tone is a first for the acclaimed director as far as I can remember. He does it so well that I was laughing most of the way through the film—me a tough guy on comedy.Granted, the excessive bacchanalia, which uncut earned this film an NC- 17, and the one minute shy of 3 hours, were unnecessary, a flaw in an otherwise spot-on mix of Margin Call and Stone's Wall Street. Although many of us lost too much money because of unscrupulous stockbrokers like Belfort, that world sure looks like fun under the hand of a world-class director.",Null,2,9,26 December 2013
It Chapter Two," Almost 3 hours of horror and allegory: challenging and entertaining.
","'For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you... I've missed you!' Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard)It Chapter Two, set in quaint and vulnerable Derry, Maine, is one crowded horror film. And that's saying something as it is the sequel to the already revered It by Stephen King. It has enough horror tropes such as jump scares, surprises, and toothy, reptilian monsters to keep the almost three hours humming.However, enough is enough. After twenty-seven years from their introduction to the scary Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club must return to face the horrific clown, and they hope, destroy It. Fortunately screenwriter Gary Dauberman and director Andy Muschietti include enough allegorical heft to keep this horror rampage from being just a visually hot mess.That the club must individually shed its fears and weaknesses to defeat the clown is both a strength and a weakness: strong because allegorically we all have to do this purging to be mentally healthy, and weak because isolating the club members weakens understanding of their development relative to each other and their consuming past. In other words, they are better at self-reflection facing each other, and therefore their past, than going it alone.Only too obvious is the film's attempt to show how some memories, not always favored ones, linger for decades, powerful enough to draw the initial gang back to end the reign of the ghoulish clown. At various times a magnificent seven of them crowd the screen with their long-suffering hang ups such as cowardice and guilt, all in need of purgation.King's Carrie and Pet Sematary, two of my favs, are careful to keep the protagonists to a minimum whereas It Chapter Two weighs It down with minimal but provocative leitmotifs, e.g., Beverly's (Jessica Chastain) abusive father or Bill's (James McAvoy) relationship with his deceased brother. Any one of these concepts could be fleshed out at the expense of more trifling ones.As in many action films, even with super heroes, the now commonplace theme of being who you are with courage gets overused as it does here. Compounding the sense of having seen it before are numerous monstrous visions, with sharp teeth and tentacled arms and legs for just a few of the stock monsters. Granted these are all manifestations of Pennywise's ability to shape shift and the writers to locate character flaws in the characters.It Chapter Two may suffer from trying too much, but, hey, that's better than not at all. For Steven King devotees, this is nectar; for the rest, this is a long fun-house ride with allegory supplying the fuel. Of course, IT reminds that keeping and nurturing friendships is the surest way to send out the clowns.",Null,1,3,8 September 2019

The message is also that similar themes abound this year as filmmakers are in concert about the issues most important to a populace reacting uncharacteristically in a recession and war year by preferring more serious films at a time when escapism would have been though to be the operative guide.Set throughout the major decades of the twentieth century, The Reader tells of 15-year old Michael Berg (David Kross) having a three-month affair with the older Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and viewing his life as an attorney who meets up with her again. Although the older woman-younger man motif works well when it moves apace, most often it lingers like long takes from the adolescent idyll, Twilight. The difference is, of course, rewarding nudity and physical and emotional connection not given to that vampire lightweight.When Reader gets to the trial, it picks up considerably from its languid pace although never reaching the potential of drama and insight such a setup should offer the playwright, David Hare. Bruno Ganz as the law professor is a welcome part of the denouement.It's Winslet's movie throughout, and she retains a stoic innocence consistent with her character. Ralph Fiennes as the older Michael never impresses me because, with the exception of his brutal turn in Schindler's List, Fiennes frequently plays variations of the most soulful-eyed depressive on the planet. He's very good at the role. As the title implies, reading is a motif that ties the major sections and characters together nicely. It is as good as you will see about the romantic aura of literature from Homer to Rilke and many writers in between.'Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations . . . . Friar Francis, Much Ado About Nothing.'",Null,9,19,21 December 2008
The Wrestler," Sure it's fake, but . . .
","'What wrestling is above all meant to portray is a purely moral concept: that of justice. The idea of 'paying' is essential to wrestling, and the crowd's 'Give it to him' means above all else 'Make him pay.'' Roland Barthes, The World of WrestlingYou bet it's fake, professional wrestling, that is. But there's nothing false about Darren Aronofsky's Wrestler, a small, impressive, occasionally pretentious film about a large man, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke), who suffers in the ring and out. (That blood from razor cuts, barbed wire, and broken glass look so painful!) Like Rocky, Ram is middle-aged and 20 years past his prime fight with The Ayatollah, whom he plans now to rematch. The other rematch with his estranged lesbian daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), does not go well though Rourke is believable as an old war horse mending his ways as well as his cuts.When he courts Stephanie by taking her back to a decrepit amusement pier they used to frequent, the sweetness of his gesture and her willingness to welcome him back after years of neglect are as convincing as any other love scene of 2008. Aronofsky seems not to care that he's beating us up with the symbolic connection of the old park and Ram.Aronofsky is no stranger to outlying souls, such as his mathematician in Pi, but Ram gets him closer to regular people who make sacrifices for their craft: losing matches, youth, and loves. In another obvious motif, Ram tries to rematch with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), herself an aging performer, a stripper, who stays connected to her son and tries to make a better life. When Cassidy spouts a line from The Passion of the Christ, Aronofsky and writer Robert D. Siegel again flirt with the outrageous allusion, this time to Christ's suffering, but somehow it all works because these are authentic characters working their way through tough times themselves without pretensions.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: 'In this life you can lose everything you love, everything that loves you. A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again, the only one that's gonna tell me when I'm through doing my thing, is you people here.'",Null,0,1,30 December 2008
Dark Shadows," Is it time to bury Burton/Depp?
","Camp piled on camp would be over the top for the best cinema satirists except maybe David Lynch and the durable Tim Burton. The latter has taken on the campy '70's TV program, Dark Shadows, enlisted his usual suspects, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, and made a comedy that holds up for laughs and wit, the latter being the province of the gifted Depp.Depp's Barnabas Collins returning to Maine after sleeping for over 200 years, finds his dysfunctional family, well, still dysfunctional. His saving their fortune and indulging his enduring playboy inclinations, puts him fang to fang again with witch Angelique, played deliciously over the top by blonde barracuda, Eva Green.Lurking in these shadows is Depp, who plays Collins with such uncharacteristic restraint that he captures his seductiveness and his menace in every turn of his smacking lips.Burton and Depp have been together eight times starting in 1990 with Edward Scissorhands. Given the lack of financial success in Dark Shadows, it may be time to bury the relationship and resurrect it at a time when, like Collins, they can feed a nostalgic craze for them rather than noticeable box office yawns.",Null,3,6,17 May 2012
Hancock," Not your garden variety super hero.
","Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman): People don't like you, Hancock. Hancock (Will Smith): Do I look like I care what people think?'Put your John Hancock on this.' How many times has someone used the signature figure of speech this way? Peter Berg's Hancock is also the real deal, a signature comic sci fi, super hero summer blockbuster unlike any other except Iron Man. Even Iron Man doesn't go far enough exploring the downside of heroism with the weaknesses of being human interfering with an ordered heroic world.Will Smith as Hancock turns in a much more nuanced performance than his I am Legend loner because here he must turn around a public that sees Hancock as an 'asshole' hero who saves people but destroys property and endangers civilians as a result of his drinking and a bruised amnesiac brain that can't remember his early life. As Hancock he must confront human beings today, not barren post apocalypse as in Legend. He rehabilitates his public profile, sobers up, and contends with his attraction to his 'publicist' Raymond's (Jason Bateman) wife, Mary (Charlize Theron).In other words, Hancock is not your garden variety super hero although he can fly and destroy with the best of them. He is conflicted about his weaknesses, his feelings toward Mary, and his forgotten past as a hero who may span thousands of human history years. In addition, the allegorical implications about The USA as flawed heroic nation imposing its will on small countries such as Vietnam and Iraq seems to lie underneath this commentary on pop-cult heroism. Even if you don't buy that aesthetic, consider the Star Trek theme of the gods envying humans even with all their emotional messes.Hancock weakens when it plays for laughs the heavy-duty existential attitudes of personal responsibility and at the same time looks for philosophical ballast. Star Trek did a better job of contrasting the lonely perfection of the gods' world with the robust, loving, but terminal world of humans. Hancock does a credible job showing how immortality without love is bound to lose to the glorious imperfection of mortality.'Oh, He hath made things worthier than Himself, And envieth that, so helped, such things do more Than He who made them!'

12 Strong," Thor wins, of course. But not the movie so much or The US in Afghanistan.
","Yes, Thor wins the battle but has lost the war ever since. Chris Hemsworth plays a stalwart, heroic Captain Mitch Nelson in the docudramaed engagement by Special Forces in Afghanistan after 9/11. On horseback, much less. The movie is called 12 Strong and 12 American soldiers did succeed in beating back an Al Qaeda warlord. Not one American soldier was lost.This feat, through a pass that would be considered Thermopylae at any time, was successful because of the cooperation of Afghan warlord General Dostum (David Negahbon), a joint venture that surely must have set the model for our endless and fruitless attempts to bring justice to that rogue country. No country has achieved success in over 2000 years, a testimony to the difficult warfare well described in this film.
Beyond the rocks and hills are no memorable lines (ironic because the writers penned superb Silence of the Lambs and The Town) and no twists of fate. 12 Strong just trudges forward to a mountain pass that promises death except for the dashing captain's Lawrence-like rush to save the day. In other words, this is another B war movie with not even 1940's stirring wisecracks or satisfactory twists. I should note that hints of writing greatness occur when the captain and the warlord engage each other in philosophical repartee. Too little.The obligatory goodbyes to family and children are there at the beginning and at the hellos in the conclusion. This formulaic stuff does not a great film make.That's all folks except the waste of Michael Shannon as Chief Warrant Officer Hal Spencer. While Hemsworth can never seriously be wasted because of his heroic mien and film provenance, Shannon is too good an actor to be given such a lean role.If you want to make some sense of the Byzantine world of Mud-eastern battle, then see 12 Strong. If you want solid filmmaking, re-see Saving Private Ryan.",Null,29,67,18 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Enjoy being scared with your friends, and see quality cinema at the same time
","'. . . The land where God did not finish creation . . . the place where myth and science meet.' Bill Randa (John Goodman)In Kong: Skull Island, the real science is the creation by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and writers of a believable myth, gigantism run amok with a hundred-foot gorilla and other nasty, very large pre-historic monsters. By paying homage to 1933 filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedack's Kong, this film shows myths can be reworked to maintain their original power while complementing the proceedings with new angles of vision.Although Skull Island is a place of death as monsters battle for control, it still houses benign natives and visiting guests like tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). The dark side is Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), who not only represents the tunnel vision of present-day militarism but also the myth of the sexually powerful black man, a cultural companion to the imposing Kong.However, this Kong has grown in sensitivity over 84 years: He protects the island's good denizens from the devils below and he respects the new blonde Fay Wray, Mason Weaver: 'People here used to live in fear, from everything. Then something strange happened: some of the monsters here started protecting them from the other monsters trying to kill them.' Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly). This is a Kong to love more than fear. Gone is the threatening sexuality of the early Kong with his probing fingers; here is a monster more like a schoolboy seeing a beautiful teacher and protecting her.Notable are this film's allusions to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (Conrad as last name of this hero and Marlow, Heart's narrator, and the last name of this WW II leftover Hank, played by Reilly with a wry detachment, a welcome antidote to almost everyone else's grave demeanor). The multiple shots of an over-sized sun and makeshift patrol boat leave no doubt of this film's debt to Apocalypse Now.Kong: Skull Island is a modern fable about our collaboration with nature and the menace of the military-industrial complex (consider the current budget proposal's lavish military spending). Beyond that, it's darn good story telling accompanied by state-of-the-art graphics to make the experience a marvel rather than a menace.'Kong's a pretty good king. Keeps to himself, mostly. But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs, unless you're picking a fight.' Marlow",Null,1,5,19 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Otherworldly
","Star Wars: Episode III--Revenge of the Sith Grade: A Director: George Lucas Screenplay: Lucas Cast: Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge), Natalie Portman (Closer), Hayden Christensen (Shattered Glass) Rating: PG John DeSando, WCBE's 'It's Movie Time'The Force in contemporary popular film criticism comes from the New York Times, so when critic A.O. Scott weighs in on George Lucas's Star Wars: Episode III--Revenge of the Sith, I listen: 'This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right (and my inner 11-year-old shudders as I type this): it's better than 'Star Wars.' 'With so many reviews echoing Scott, I will not repeat my similar praise but alter it slightly by saying that Sith is second for me to the original now called Episode IVA New Hope, which has a clarity, innocence, and spirit so reflective of my family and the time when we saw it I cannot allow any other episode to eclipse it. Sith may be superior, but my memory preserves the primacy of the first Star Wars. More interesting than my nostalgia is the allegorical commentary even Lucas admits is underneath Sith. When Darth Vader tells Obi-Wan, 'If you're not with me, you're my enemy,' no conscious adult can miss the echo of George Bush's similar challenge. Obi-Wan's response is a liberal's rejoinder to the 21st-century neocon's streamlined mantras: 'Only a Sith thinks in absolutes.' Lucas himself, while admitting that he started this line of thinking about Nixon and Vietnam with the notion that 'the senate could give itself over, could surrender to a dictator,' said recently, 'I hope that situation never arises in our country. Maybe the film will awaken people to this danger.'What makes Sith superior to all other sci-fi films, even others in its own canon, is the CGI that is itself otherworldly: The battle scenes are full of interstellar acrobatics with the usual ironic humor and the light saber fights so evocative of old-fashioned Errol Flynn/ Han Solo swashbuckling that the film carries itself to greatness on the tails of technology.",Null,0,1,22 May 2005
Ray," 'Ray' is a film for all the people.
","'De-Lovely' earlier this year was the lovely biopic of the year for me until I saw 'Ray.' Much as I love the tunes of Cole Porter, the genial crossover songs of Ray Charles could not have been better integrated into a biography than Director Taylor Hackford ('Proof of Life') does along with Charles' collaboration. Although the bio takes us only to 1966, when he overcame his heroin addiction, 'The Genius' has been established, the complex artist partially revealed, and the rest of his life until his death in 2004 telescoped into a weak epilogue to an otherwise strong film.The scenes in recording studios and nightclubs help satisfy my endless yearning to experience how artists create their works. For instance, when Charles' wife learns of his heroin addiction and threatens to leave him, he is inspired to write 'Hit the Road Jack.' The genius's struggle to get control of his growing empire by overcoming the larcenous machinations of agents and friends is a revealing subtext on the challenges a blind, romantic artist must face in the unfriendly business of music.The recurring flashback scenes to a childhood tragedy (Hackford's and Charles' attempt to explain his drug addiction) are after a while downright irritating, and finally, gratuitous, if you think about how the film could have cut down from its formidable 153 minutes.Jamie Foxx will deservedly be nominated for the titular role. Most actors could imitate Charles' ticks and jerks, but Foxx breathes Charles' dreams and demons and projects them, addiction to womanizing represented as well as heroin. Don't worry that no man could parrot Charles voice, for Foxx lip-synchs almost perfectly. I look forward to see if Kevin Spacey in 'Beyond the Sea' actually covering Bobby Darin's songs can top Foxx's spot-on versions. Walt Whitman wrote of Americans, 'Each singing what belongs to him or her.' Ray Charles sang a unique fusion of R&B, Gospel, and Rock like an immortal American poet for all the people. 'Ray' is a film for all the people.",Null,1,3,27 October 2004
Inception," Imaginative espionage
","'You're asking me for Inception. I hope you do understand the gravity of that request.' Cobb Grave it is: Inception is a dream within a dream and maybe more layers than that as Memento's Christopher Nolan plays this time not just with time but with the confluence of appearance and reality in a Freudian world of dream manipulation and regret. Is it also about the movie-watching experience—probably.Did I just make any sense? Probably not because I am still working out the many layers of this most challenging summer sci-fi thriller in which Com Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is hired to manipulate a corporate head's subconscious through dreams to plant an idea, not Cobb's usual extraction of corporate secrets but this time inception. It's espionage at its most imaginative and confounding but fun in the action and the struggle to keep up with what is going on.If this sounds all like The Matrix (1999), well, it is difficult to piece together the different realities like that film, and like Dreamscape (1984) it depicts dream manipulation. But it is a memorable film all its own as Cobb struggles in a dream world with his late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) that impinges on the world he and Ariadne (Ellen Page) construct like architects.You got it: Mal means bad, and Ariadne is the Greek mythical guide through a maze. Nolan is more obviously figurative here than even in his Dark Knight, which was moody and cerebral enough for an American comic book hero, Batman.Nolan continues to know how to please an audience visually—the action sequences on a variety of terrains devised by Ariadne's imagination are as visceral as the dreams are cerebral. But like Memento, Nolan is interested in shaking up our control of the order of things: The most disturbing idea of the film for me was the question of what's real and what's appearance, when is death not death, and in what order do dreams and death come in reality.Although I still don't know, I'll return to Inception to find out and certainly clear out the summer cobwebs, or should that be Cobbwebs?",Null,1,7,19 July 2010
Defiance," A powerful reminder
","Jews have had a difficult time countering the opinion that they did not resist the Nazis enough, even in the face of Casablanca's hero, Victor Laslow, and the heroics of Escape from Sobibor, a challenge of conscience as all German guards had to be killed in order for 600 Jews to escape. Defiance needs to be added to the list of powerful reminders that Jews defied the Nazis in numbers and spirit.Daniel Craig, effacing any overt images of James Bond, plays Tuvia Bielski, leader of a rag-tag group of survivors in the Belarussian forest for years, and two other brothers (Liv Schreiber and Jamie Bell), who revenge the slaughter of their family and help hapless Jews by building a village. Although the encounters with the Germans tend to have the unreal simplicity of electronic games, the danger of living in the almost idealized forest is palpable, and the imminence of death is constant. An outbreak of typhus reminds us that this is no arbor romance out of Shakespeare. At times it seems director/writer Edward Zwick tries to make a thriller out of a true story, thereby doing almost an injustice to the horror of the history. My own taste now, after seeing two other Holocaust stories this fallBoy in the Striped Pajamas and The Readerleads me to like best the simple fiction of Pyjamas, which figuratively embodies all the contradictions of heroism and cowardice in a small family of Germans no less. None can compare with Night and Fog, Alain Resnais' unremitting visual reminiscence of the horror juxtaposed with contemporary shots of historic bucolic death camps.Defiance effectively relates the tumult and degradation of running from an enemy while entertaining with an almost Hollywood vision of a magical forest and enchanting visitors.",Null,4,10,10 January 2009
Lord of War," A necessary evil.
","Nicholas Cage's Yuri Orlav is the embodiment of the situationally ethical arms dealer who justifies his profession with such specious arguments as supplying arms to countries for their 'defense' or because someone will take his place if he leaves--unsatisfactory justifications for families of slaughtered African refugees and bloody poor excuses for the US government.Director Andrew Nicol takes too long in Lord of War to establish the flawed Yuri through a series of expected scenarios leading him into the rarefied position as top gunrunner in the world, with powerful and dangerous leaders willing to give him money and protection in exchange for arms. Only after Ukrainian Yuri has become comfortable with his moral ambiguity and his family remains ignorant of his trade does the director/writer introduce the tensions between Yuri's better angel and greedy devil. This conflict is also couched in the most general and clichéd ways to the extent that his flawed reasoning remains intact (his brother, Vitali, played by Jared Leto, provides the alter ego of slacking but morally outraged pretty boy) but is counterweighted by his concern for his wife and child. His relationship with a brutal Liberian general pits Yuri's ethical life against his family life.Yuri's voice-over narration takes a few shortcuts to his character while exposing the essentially conflicted nature of a trade where he is so good at what he does that he is reluctant to leave. 'I am a necessary evil' is the closest he comes to recognizing his corruption. Nicol layers enough wisecracking comments from Yuri to help mitigate the overwhelming sense of Yuri's moral decline.The contribution of this character to modern fictional reality is that politicians and business people are faced with the same dilemma of wishing an end to the conflict in Iraq for reasons of honor but hoping for continuation for pragmatic reasons such as profit (as usual Halliburton and Cheney come to mind). When the closing credits remind us that the US and Russia are among the top arms dealers in the world, Nicol's allegorical subtext rises like fat to the surface. Too late to make it a great action film; too didactic to make it great art.As for the endurance of evil, Hawthorne also had the insight in 'Young Goodman Brown': 'Evil is the nature of Mankind.'",Null,14,57,12 September 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Physical and Manic
","Dr. John Watson: Holmes, does your depravity know no bounds? Sherlock Holmes: No.The Da Vinci Code meets The Wild, Wild West by way of Jackie Chan and The Fight Club—Robert Downey, Jr. captures the manic, addictive nature of Sherlock Holmes without the sober intellectuality of Basil Rathbone, the Holmes against which all others are measured. Director Guy Ritchie sets a feverish pace for the Victorian detective story, allowing Downey to overindulge his acting tics and considerable athletic ability to create a modern emblem of the deductive thinker, imitating the more physical evidencing of CSI rather than the traditionally contemplative crime fighter of Conan Doyle's Holmes.The intellectual side seems to come from the 20th-century attitude indulging of Holmes and Dr. Watson (Jude Law), himself an accomplished fighter and worrier. Their banter even when they are fighting a French giant (imagine that! shades of James Bond) is more Butch Cassidy than Sherlock Holmes.As in the Da Vinci Code, the villain is associated with a secret powerful organization, like the Masons, that plans a serious overthrow of government and world domination. Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is the pre-Moriarity evil brain, who seemingly has come back from the dead to further his nefarious plot.Holmes, like Dan Brown's Robert Langdon, is the brains outside the police solving Blackwood's crimes because Inspector Lestrade and his cops are clueless. Not that we don't get the usual Holmesian lectures about the simple clues we and Lestrade missed; it's just that Downey delivers them rapid fire as if he couldn't wait to get to the next athletic activity. Rathbone could deliver them like sipping a fine wine.The strength of the film is in the physicality, from meticulously designed London settings to incessant and overly long fisticuffs. The bare knuckling allows Downey to be shirtless, a plus for older folks who thought such a physique the province of men half his age.The presence of gifted criminal Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is a welcome touch as she sparks the kind of analysis Holmes needs most—of himself. Ritchie has picked this little part of the Holmes legend wisely but fails to expand it in a classic opportunity lost to the relentless action.This Sherlock Holmes is a 20th century quick-cut sleuth in 19th century waistcoat. I have plenty of memories of that hyperactive 20th; I just wanted to smoke a pipe in the 19th with a reserved Holmes and listen to the deductions of his exploits.I'll wait for the Rathbone reruns.Dr. John Watson: (to Holmes drinking a liquid) 'You do know what you are drinking is meant for eye surgery?'",Null,14,30,24 December 2009
The Secret Life of Pets," Hilarious with acerbic Despicable-Me touches.
","'All of us have suffered at the hand of humans. They say they loves us, then they throw us out.' Snowball (Kevin Hart voice) Snowball has a jaundiced view of the world, being a cute white rabbit without a home, a street urchin in a most enjoyable animation, The Secret Life of Pets. That he's out to get humans is a given, but his new friends, Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C.K.) and big mongrel Duke (Eric Stonestreet), come from a more privileged environment but are unleashed to the world when their human leaves for work.The frequently hilarious and bizarre world of home and homeless pets and the tough animals they conflict and consort with is, of course, a figurative way of looking at how we humans treat those different from us (dogs, cats, for example). Add the dynamic of how we treat our pets, and this romp becomes Animal Farm and Toy Story, with enough slapstick to keep it light but also a happy minimum of preaching the importance of charity and friendship.Max and Duke duke it out until they find they actually work as a team quite well, an ongoing lesson to see the strengths in others rather than their faults. Even the meanest street animal, living in the sewer, has enough wit and love to earn our respect regardless of how unrefined they are.When Snowball, as tough and lovable as a rabbit can be, turns on its verbal street machine gun, step aside because he's funny in ways that cross the social divide. Add to these delights a white Pomeranian who watches soaps and a sausage dog rubbing his back with a blender and you can see why I chuckled through most of the animation.Secret Life is also about the difference between the haves and have not's with plenty of good will to equalize that difference. But most of all, from the Despicable Me and Minions team, Illumination Entertainment, enough cynical observations to fill a Don-Rickles joke book and just enough heart to appeal to optimists. As sea monkeys say, 'It's not our fault if we don't look like the ads.' Yes, you've seen toys in Toy Story on their own when humans are absent, and in a sense this is the same story, including buddies who help each other out (remember Woody and Buzz). The difference in Secret Life is the witty, sometimes sardonic dialogue: for example, remarks that everyone is moving to Brooklyn, Snowball quips, 'I'm not talking about hipster real estate trends.' The other difference is that so much is going on here the emotional rewards of Toy Story are not as prevalent.But, hey, it's summer and this is one enjoyable animation.",Null,4,9,8 July 2016
WALL·E," The most . . .
","'With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt.' Shakespeare's Romeo and JulietForget making love (I can't). The new erogenous zone is the hand, specifically holding hands as featured in the new Pixar animation, Wall*E. A futuristic love story between the titular trash collecting robot (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), doing his thing for hundreds of fruitless years, and a beautiful search robot, Eve (appropriately named), who discovers he has collected the answer humans floating in space have hoped for, evidence that they can return to their garbage suffocated planet.Like all love affairs, it's difficult to figure out their attraction, but love it is, and it propels this little gem of a film right into the endearing space of Nemo, Toy Story, and my favRatatouille. Pixar and writer/director Andrew Stanton have the gift of displaying humanity in its flaws and its glories while chastising its destructive side, in this case the neglected environment. While the love story, hand holding and all, is worth the admission, the satire of an indolent, wasteful population accurately disturbs as our population continues to get fatter and more environmentally careless, to the point where we vacate the premises.The animators have drawn heavily and artfully from Star Wars, 2001, Hello Dolly, Seurat, and E.T., among others, but most of all the wizards have revived the simple love storyit shouldn't take animation, science fiction, and post- apocalyptic stories to do so, but heck, I've been looking for love since my second failed marriage a long time ago. Who would have thought? Handholding! Now that's simple and provocative, environmentally safe, and my 3rd grade nun's criticism of me (holding a little girl's hand: 'You dirty thing').

The Good Shepherd," 'Cold is as cold does.'
","'There were enemies without to destroy him, And spies and self-seekers within . . . .' Eliot, The RockThe cold war fed the imaginations of many worthy novelists such as Graham Greene and John le Carre, leaving us with the impression of spies who gave up most of their personal life in clandestine service to country. In Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), working on the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, flashes back to 1939, when as a child he witnessed his father's suicide and began a life of emotional withdrawal, a valuable attitude for his role in the emerging CIA but an inevitable loss to his emotional life, especially with family.Director De Niro knows quite a bit about intrigue given the dark figures he has played as one of America's leading actors. His lighting is consistently low key, as if a secret world lies behind every tenebrous shot. His frame is frequently static and spare, as if the void will be filled by inexplicable pain. He knows atmosphere and he knows lonely, isolated characters, as if Travis Bickle were being channeled into Edward Wilson.Maybe too isolated. Damon plays Wilson so minimalist that knowing the interior of his character is impossible. He is as stoic as Will Ferrell in Stranger than Fiction but without any humor. Ferrell failed to move me, and similarly Damon makes me feel cheated about being able to identify in some way with Wilson. But then, cold is a cold does. As for Angelina Jolie's Margaret, Wilson's wife, she is supposed to remain an enigma because her husband has marginalized her in his life so we have no chance to hear her lonely heart.De Niro captures the nether world of espionage, beginning with Wilson's induction into the Skull and Bones Society at Yale (W is an alumnus, not the best endorsement for the group's integrity), infamous for its secrecy and nurturer of national leaders, and ending with the Bay of Pigs loss and the challenge to his family unity.",Null,9,19,21 December 2006
Finding Dory," Could be an Oscar nomination for best picture.
","'I suffer from short-term memory loss.' Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres)Just to intimidate you and me, the statistics show that Finding Dory is the largest grossing animation in film history, currently at about half a billion dollars and moving up. Yes, more than its companion, Finding Nemo. However I make more demands on the film with that kind of pedigree, and this one exceeds my demands as few other animations have.Dory is the cutest fish you've ever seen, a blue tang with a disability. The genius of this warm, family comedy is that her short-term memory is a source of affection for her family and friends and the audience. She struggles to remember from moment to moment, most prominently after she has lost contact with her family.The film becomes her odyssey to find her family and, in existential terms, herself. The companions who accompany her are eccentric and lovable, most notably Hank (Ed O'Neill), whose gruff octopus exterior masks a heart as big as the ocean.Overcoming Dory's disability and re-connecting with her family are the prominent motifs, not that the latter is at all foreign to the Pixar empire. It's just that Dory's lack of self awareness and genuine love of her fellow fish predict she will be a winner no matter where she lands.'What would Dory Do?' is a refrain that tells us we have a self-directed heroine here who has a reasoning ability better than her mortal man's. Everyone is smarter for asking that question, regardless of the death-dominated consequences.I don't usually dwell on the technicals, but this film has art work to make even kelp beautiful. The undulating vegetation and synchronized fish schools are marvelous to behold.In the end, this is a film not to be missed if you want to keep up with the best of cinema.

Arrival," Better than Contact, almost as good as Close Encounters
","'Now that's a proper introduction.' Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) Alien visitation can be pretty much as you envision it because no one has a clue what aliens would look like or how they would communicate. The latter is the special focus of Arrival, a very modern mash up of Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Contact, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and countless other sci-fi's that attempt to show the biggest challenge to be understanding the visitors before the military makes a mess.Louise is a linguist engaged by the US to translate the whale-like sounds of heptapods, who have seven elephant trunk-like legs and squirt ink in Rorschach circles that form the language she must translate before the military gets trigger happy. Beside the emphasis on good communication skills, Arrival effectively touches on the need for cooperation to face a potential threat from outer space.It becomes clear that before we deal with other worlds, we need to understand each other in this one. Starting with oneself as Louise must do, and her physicist partner in the project, Ian (Jeremy Renner), understanding the foreign language becomes more an art and less a science.Director Dennis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer expertly guide us through the competing forces during the uncertainty of the invasion without the usual screaming and yelling of mass hysteria or many other tropes of the sci-fi genre. The 12 space ships around the world are more like the apostles on an almost inscrutable mission, carried by ships that look like contact lenses, all the better for us to see ourselves, I suppose.To say much more would be to reveal plot, not a good thing in a film that luxuriates in ambiguity. Sufficient to say that Arrival is an entertaining and intelligent voyage into our minds as it provokes us to consider the power of memory shaping how we deal with reality now and the power of communication to bridge the gap of misunderstanding . Some day world peace may depend on those skills.",Null,1,10,17 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," In virus times, we need this hope.
","'Prison is no fairy tale world.' Red Redding (Morgan Freeman)This quote is partly true in the context of the super-popular melodrama (based on a Stephen King short story), The Shawshank Redemption. As the opening 1947 scenes in Shawshank Prison in author King's Maine (actually filmed in Mansfield, Ohio), the hero, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is raped multiple times by the 'Sisters.' That's to be expected from what prison lore offers over the years in movies and reality.After Andy gets through these humiliations, and Morgan Freeman intones writer-director Frank Darabont fine script about life inside and out, the story turns almost into a fairy tale: Former bank vice president Andy brings his business skills to high and low: warden, guards, and prisoners. Additionally, he and Red make like a buddy film out of the boredom of everyday prison life.The intersection of being sent to the hole for months and working the system to almost a vacation world creates an incarceration nostalgia that seems too Hollywood fantastic to be real. Andy's acquisition through Red of a rock hammer and a poster of Rita Hayworth not only expresses his love of geology and pop culture, it also reveals the salutary effect of the arts in lonely times.When Andy plays an Italian opera over the loudspeaker, Red's narration describes the music like a beautiful bird. It's paradise for a brief moment.Hope is the operative theme, hope that Andy and Red will someday be free to enjoy the Mexican Pacific Ocean:
'They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.' AndyAs entertainment in a time when we have been imprisoned by a pandemic, Shawshank Redemption is a welcome antidote.

Rango," Smart Satire
","'Stay in school, eat your veggies, and burn all the books that ain't Shakespeare.' Rango So this is where smart satire is hiding: in a low-key animation released at the worst time of year for movies (between January and May). It's Rango, with the gifted voice of Johnny Depp in the titular role and veterans such as Ned Beatty voicing the villain.The inspiration for this witty oater is the water plot of Chinatown buttressed by such chestnuts as High Noon and spaghetti Westerns, most notably the ones with the Man with No Name. Depp's Jake is a hapless drifter whom fate sends to a very dry Western town, Dirt, to help the people find water that has mysteriously vanished. Be it Los Angeles or Dirt, it's probable that a no-good businessman like Noah Cross in Chinatown (John Huston) or in this case, the mayor (Ned Beatty) has taken it for himself to get deeds to land that people will eventually give up for lack of water.The allusions and dialogue from those westerns and Chinatown come faster than even the best film geek could digest in one sitting. Adding the Apocalypse Now Valkyries scene gives richness outside the Western motif. The faces of the various animals, a chameleon for Rango (Depp), turtle for mayor, and snake for town tough guy, Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), are just a few of the many richly detailed characters. In a way, the Pixar influence is all over the film with the attention to individual characters and plot points that reveal those characters rather than serve ingenious animations.My favorite is the Eastwood homage in the No Name role, a laconic, weathered old guy riding a golf cart, not a horse. At the point that Rango sees a city over the hill, as in the Cliff Robertson Twilight Zone story of the wagon train seeing a gas station, director Gore Verbinski and crew have fused more than one great film to a great TV series, and the irreverent reverence is complete.Take the whole family to this fun movie. It's the old-timers like me, though, who grew up on Westerns, who are going to smile the most.",Null,1,2,16 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," It has everything to entertain and challenge.
","'Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige.' Mike (Edward Norton)Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is important to see if only for Michael Keaton in the titular role, a has-been movie hero (Birdman) hoping to make a comeback as director, writer, and actor in his Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. Keaton will be nominated for an Oscar; he's that good.The film is also a witty commentary on celebrity (as the above quote attests), its tragic consequences when success does not follow success. In addition, collegial relationships are explored during the high-strung rehearsal of gifted actors at the St. James Theater on Broadway, challenging each other in professional and personal ways. No fellow actor is tougher or brighter than Edward Norton as Mike, whose thespian gifts are generously displayed but who is sexually impotent off stage. When he works on stage with Keaton and Naomi Watts, the acting is better ensemble work than in any other film I can think of this year.Besides the stunning acting, the camera and editing are to be experienced: the careering camera visits dressing rooms, hallways, and stage without skipping a beat--the director is extending takes and cutting minimally, letting the camera do the work while scenes follow scenes seamlessly. The effect is the high-energy of creative people bursting the confines of narrow backstage to emerge in the seemingly endless space of the stage, an expanse waiting for the egos and talents to fill it.It's all about acting, and it is not always pretty: 'I wish I had more self-respect.' Lesley (Naomi Watts) 'You're an actress.' Laura (Andrea Riseborough)However, it's Keaton's acting that dominates: edgy and impatient, on the lookout for the right nuance, diffident and dreaming--he's an artistic mess. Along with some gritty realism comes a modicum of magic realism such as telekinesis and flying, both not so weird given the creative energy that seems to come out of the walls.",Null,10,20,30 October 2014
The Big Short," Fun and Informative and ultimately depressing.
","'Synthetic collateralized debt obligation . . .'A docudrama about the bank-mortgage failures of 2008 has the potential for being BORING. Not so with Margin Call, which dealt with discovering the bank failures in a pleasingly clear exposition that kept the drama high and the technical explanations simple. With the same writer along for the ride, The Big Short is not quite as digestible about sub-prime mortgage shorting (see above phrase) but clear enough to see some very smart people betting against the mortgages, profiting if they fail.But that means hoping our fellow Americans will bail out the banks, which they did through massive government infusion of money. Mark Baum (Steve Carrel) is the conscience in a film full of amoral opportunists, most of whom were just living the American dream by siphoning fees from outrageously easy loans. Yet even Mark is not perfect.Christian Bale as Mike once again shows he is in the top tier of film actors along with Daniel Day Lewis and Tom Hardy. Mike is the one who first spies the sub-prime pattern of weak loans to workers who can't eventually keep up with payments or whose houses have put them 'underwater.' His sleuthing and profiting represent the ethical dilemma the film so well and regularly showcases: Does anyone care for the little guy while you are cashing in.What The Big Short has in spades, however, is humor, e.g., 'Tell me the difference between stupid and illegal and I'll have my wife's brother arrested.' Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) The technical terms mixing with street language are frequently parsed by characters or text that makes sense. Many clear lessons are delivered by pop-cult notables like Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdon, whose command of the spoken word helps relax the film's more arcane moments. Super cast, even producer Brad Pitt has a pivotal role as a retired trader. The smart dialogue, effective close ups, and made-to-order topicality offer The Big Short as a movie to see while we move into Oscar's season.",Null,2,6,23 December 2015
Prometheus," It brings some fire to the summer.
","If you're looking for a summer treat and you thought the Avengers is all the good sci-fi available, then look no further, for Prometheus is a satisfying rouser not better than Avatar or the original Alien, but an unpretentious pulp delight.Giants from the stars painted in Earth caves (see Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods for a '70's take on the influence of terrestrial visitors) inspired the journey the Prometheus is taking to 'meet our maker.' It takes a couple of years to get there with the help of a Hal-like robot, David (Michael Fassbender).Director Ridley Scott is the Alien helmer, whose image of severe indigestion resulting in a grotesque C-section of a xenomorph is forever enshrined in the memories of even the most temporary geek. In this version, it's probable that the late 21st century spaceship seeking out our makers is a prequel to the alien franchise, but no matter. While few lasting images occur since most of the creatures are derivative, the sets and CGi are splendid.No wonder because H.R. Giger's designs and effects that won a 1979 Oscar are newly minted for Prometheus. Although large-headed insect-like attackers and cobra-like menaces are here again, they are wrapped around by a good, not great, story that at the very least stimulates argument about evolution, the role of science, and the origins and fate of mankind. In addition, the crew is largely scrappy, scruffy mercenaries who can provide a light moment but who generally serve as fodder for the monsters.The crew goes easily to their eternal reward because they are so thinly drawn as to elicit no sympathy from us. However, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is drawn fully as she agonizes over her love, Dr. Charlie Holloway, a hot-headed colleague contrasting the level-headed and intrepid Elizabeth. Rapace is no Sigourney Weaver, whose turn in Alien gave her a permanent place in the heroic sci-fi actress pantheon. Yet Rapace has the intelligent, survival-prepared persona who serves as our representative aboard that calamitous vessel.Charlize Theron, playing the self-centered Meredith Vickers, who represents the company that funds the trip, is a half-villain with much more restraint than her bad-girl dark queen in Snow White and the Huntsman. That was over-the-top acting unfit for an Oscar winner. Here she's relatively calm while still playing bad.In all, Prometheus doesn't bring a whole lot of literary fire to the summer, but it is entertaining. Just don't expect to have a coherent discussion of the big philosophical questions; however, you do get a bunch of reveals that will titillate.Including one that promises a sequel. See you next summer.",Null,1,2,8 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Yes, she's Wonderful!
","'It is our sacred duty to defend the world. And it is what I am going to do.' Diana (Gal Gadot)That's a simple manifesto spoken by Amazonian princess Diana, aka to us Wonder Woman. Here's a DC Comics hero to go nose to nose with the big boys from Marvel, at least on a par with the best of them. You go, Girl.From Diana's island paradise, Themyscria, to the WWI front lines, she remains steadfast in her goal to rid the world of war, starting with the one to end all wars. That she cannot end any of our wild wars, even as a demigod, is a lesson she learns.That simplicity is also naivety, but innocence is part of her charm leading to a satisfactory second act where the comedy is affecting in a heroine-out-of water motif in London. The love affair between her and spy Steve (Chris Pine) may be the best this summer because like her, it has innocence and idealism all in one. Although Pine's role may seem to be better written, the actors have an unmistakable chemistry. Do the characters make love? See for yourself, and let me know if you like the answer.The scenes of the origin at the island have a freshness I haven't seen this summer. Amazonian women fly like Cirque-du-Soleil acrobats to dispatch German soldiers; Queen Hippolyta (Connie Neilsen) and her sister, Antiope (Robin Wright), are as believable warriors as Thor and Wolverine, and certainly just as pretty. The idea of an island of competent women does more for feminism than all the high-blown speeches of sociologists, and without the rant.How Diana and Steve help the war to its armistice is part of the film's fun to figure out. The film does not have the rampant sardonic humor of the mature Marvel series (although the mercenary soldiers are amusing), and it relies too much in the third act on those old superhero staples, electricity and excessive mayhem. Yet it does have a heroine more interesting than many of the males who have dominated the genre. Wait, wait! Could a reason for its success be that it's directed by a competent Patty Jenkins? Female hero, female director. That's a Marvelous combination!",Null,5,14,1 June 2017
Despicable Me," Gru will win you.
","Gru: We are going to pull off the TRUE crime of the century... we are going to steal the MOON! Although Despicable Me winks at behemoth Pixar with a little robot like the Pixar desk lamp before the titles, Despicable Me does one better in the cynical category.A villain of major contradictions and the cutest orphans since Annie help create a world of kid fantasy that still tries to deal with crazy parents and malign technology. It does so, not in Pixar's full color wonderland, but rather in a dim dream like state where the villain Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is vulnerable in a laboratory of worthless weapons with an assistant, Dr Nefario (Russell Brand), like Bond's Q, but with worse hearing (he responds to making a dart gun by crafting one that begins with an 'f').But the real gift of this little animation gem is homely Gru, the world's best villain but financially least productive. His plan to steal the moon is about the cleverest comment on how much we have stolen, innocence among the treasures; the moon is all we have left to lose. But there is also something else to be stolen—Gru's heart—and that's easily filched by Agnes, Margo, and Edith, orphans selling the equivalent of girl scout cookies but sub textually a heart for a villain who doesn't know yet it's a loving parent's.You'll have to see how he steals the moon and the girls' affection because these improbable actions come straight from a child's sense of how the universe is really run. As in the sequences of Gru reading bad kiddy lit to the girls, the screenplay could have been an insult to child intelligence—it's not.It's so good that so far two of the best films of the summer and maybe the year have been 3-D animations from Pixar and Universal, its first and I hope not its last.",Null,2,5,9 July 2010
1408," So much for maid service.
","'Hotel from hell,' 'roach motel,' 'flea bag' and on and on to describe an accommodation that didn't meet our minimum requirements for a good night's sleep. Mikael Hafstrom's 1408 fits all descriptors and some movies as well such as Psycho, Hostel, Vacancy, and Bug. The titular number refers to the room no one is allowed to use at NYC's Dolphin Hotel (perhaps based on an infamous room at San Diego's Hotel del Coronado). As the manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), warns, 'It's an f'n evil room.' It's Stephen King territory all right: Famous debunking-ghost-stories writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack, having inn problems as he did in Identity) visits the room, after hammering the management to let him in, to write about it as another in a line of fictional horror homes. As with The Shining, disbelievers should become believers, in this case within an hourno one has ever lasted more, including the over 50 deaths since the early 20th century.But clichéd horrors like bleeding walls and uncontrollable hot water faucets are just part of the complex world of this genre. Enslin's loss of a daughter preys on his memory and becomes real in the miasma of the chamber, where what's real and imagined are never clearly defined, resting on the genre staple of the mad mind mirroring the mad hell outside. In effect the story certifies ghosts if you minimally accept the presence of departed loved ones in our minds.After a haunting exposition with some deafening silence and a spirited argument between Enslin and Olin worth seeing, the plot devolves into clichés about madness made visible through genre staples. The twists at the end aren't up to the similarly eerie Sixth Sense, but Cusack and Jackson are worth watching.Like the 13th floor, room 1408 should be the one to avoid if you have a choice. The movie 1408 is not as scary as you hoped, but it sure is a mess. So much for maid service.",Null,15,48,19 June 2007
Straight Outta Compton," Informative and entertaining biopic about one of music's greatest moments.
","'I can make you legit.' Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti)So he does make the gangsta rappers legit and wealthy and famous. Straight Outta Compton is a chronology of the hip-hop movement from unknown songs about LAPD oppression of black youths to big-business music, whose money makes for distorted friendships and cut-throat tactics. N.A.W. (Niggaz with Attitude) grew universally popular, similar to the Beatles, so fast as to be almost unbelievable.It's all in the lyrics. For some of us not versed in the vernacular and history of rap, this biopic is helpful putting the history together. Less helpful than that is the film's depiction of how the powerful lines were formed. Only a few shots of Ice Cube's (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) notebooks give you an idea of the process. The irony of Cube's creating his famous anthem, F--k Tha Police, after several abusive run-ins with LAPD, does help me see origins.But then, I am always disappointed that these musical biopics don't give enough insight into the creative process of its artists. Maybe that's an impossible task.However, I should say the sequence involving Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) coaxing out a performance from Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) of his groundbreaking hit, 'boyz n the hood,' is instructive and humorous. As bad a boy as Dre might have been, his stewardship of the rappers is clearly fundamental to their success. I would have liked more imagining of these crucial creative moments.Not to say, however, the film slights the influence of such moguls as Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor), who built the success of Death Row on the backs of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dog, too many times with violence a main ingredient.The film, to its detriment, downplays the importance of their crime glorification and misogynist themes (tossing a naked woman into the hallway and locking the door behind her!). The absence of the competition such as De La Soul, Public Enemy, and Eminem is lamentable. Then, what could be expected from two of the film's producers, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre?

The Woman in Black," Too old . . .
","I can't get excited about the film version of Woman in Black any more than I could the hoary stage play now second only to Mousetrap for West End longevity. The haunted house conceit with all its creeks, cracks, and cranky toys is too old itself to creep me out. That the film revives the old Hammer film company is the best revision of all.Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe), a young 19th century attorney, is given a last chance with the firm by going to an old Victorian mansion at the end of a vulnerable causeway to settle the estate. Leaving behind his motherless boy, Joseph (Misha Handley), an early part of the abandoned-child ghost motif to come, Arthur and we endure the loud bangs in the house when each door opens, the fuzzy ghost of the mother who long ago lost her child at the mansion, and a thousand other bumps in the night to make even the rude mechanical restlessly sitting next to me say, 'This is getting dumber by the minute.' It's not always dumb if you sense in the adaptation of Susan Hill's classic novel a theme expressed best by James Joyce as the 'melancholy unity between the living and the dead.' The film pivots on the attempt of parents to connect with long gone or lost children, who return in either vision or reality, depending on your opinion of the occult. In that way the film is saved from being a repetitive vehicle for scary-movie tropes. I even found a visual reference in the long hall of sconces to Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. Thank goodness for cinema history in needy places.Kave Quinn's production design, right down to the folk art toys, is noteworthy as is Tim Maurice-Jones's cinematography, be it bird's-eye shots of the mansion or dimly-lit corridors. In a better horror story, both artists would be better feted.If you are anything of a realist, you'll probably chuckle at the ending, a lame attempt to reflect Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's belief in spiritualism. Like the film before it, the ending is less creepy than it is comical. Part of that comes from Daniel Radcliffe's less than smooth delivery and the laughable horror elements that will grace this genre forever.Join the dead in one happy party hosted by Hammer Films.",Null,12,30,2 February 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," Even nuns would approve this lukewarm potboiler.
","'My inner goddess is dancing the merengue.' Anastasia Grey from the novel, Fifty Shades of Grey You're approaching this filmed version of the wildly successful sex novel Fifty Shades of Grey in the right way if you think that quote is sophomoric, typical of a naïve English major stepping out into life. It is a silly statement, and the heroine of the film, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), is less naïve than she is a thrill seeker.Fifty Shades of Grey is a torture of unfulfilled curiosity about S-M, for the heat is low on the chili pepper. Although Steele's exposed breasts supposedly lead to greater erotica, they rather are the limits of exposure and the wrong signs of sensuality, which should emanate anyway from words, not just flesh.The purveyor of the sexual fantasy, the dominant Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), is a sadly repressed, secret misogynist, whose introduction of Ana to the pleasures of his red room (handcuffs, whips, et al.—the usual but just more finely turned out) turns out to be an exploration of low-level power plays rather than a turn on. In fact, her role as submissive eventually turning dominant is never fully explored here, just hinted at, but enough of the hints, please: She's a power bottom; I can feel it even if I can't see it.Mr. Dornan may be the problem, or perhaps director Sam Taylor-Johnson is, because the actor is a much better model than actor. At the least, he needs to have depths that can be explored, but here he seems cyber-like stoic. When he says, 'I don't do romance. My tastes are very singular. You wouldn't understand,' the hidden promise that he is complicated and ultimately lovable never reaches the audience.In other words, although it takes quite a bit of bad sex to bore me, this antiseptic delivery of pleasure is just that, or just what you would have expected from boring Bella Swann of The Twilight tortures (Anastasia being based on Bella, I am told). Bella was boring, Ana is boring, and this film is boring. Yet in the cold light of analysis, Johnson is the best part of the film, a not particularly beautiful woman, all the better for us to identify with, and a semi-naif adventuring out without a map.To witness Ana panting from the first time she sees him in his perfectly tailored suit covering a perfectly sculpted body is to question immediately what kind of a Romantic she really is (or maybe I'm carrying my love for 19th-century sensibilities too far into the 21st). Again it could be the director calling for some over-the-top acting.Hundreds of years ago, Geoffrey Chaucer included a story in his Canterbury tales that explained what women really want—mastery over men. Now that's telling it like it is, and I suspect this tale, which goes into three novels, will end up the same way. The film is only a disappointing beginning.But getting anywhere meaningful through flabby porn is too slow and stupid, even for a broken-down Catholic boy in whom the S-M-leaning nuns instilled a life-long interest in passionate sex only to discover it's not in films that promise to bare it all but rather hidden deep in the Cinderella story.Mother Mary, help us all in this dead-zone time of year, where good movies are much scarcer than good sex.",Null,11,25,12 February 2015
The Wolverine," One of the best this summer
","'Eternity can be a curse . . . a man can run out of things to live for.' Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) Mythology and poetry are rife with stories about gods who envy men, their emotions and even their deaths. The Wolverine admirably mixes this motif with some very fancy camera and foot work in one of the best sci-fi hero films of the summer.Points should be given to director James Mangold and his writers for relocating the long-nailed hero, Logan (Hugh Jackman), to Japan, where samurai stories glorify lonely heroes with super battle powers. The contrast between his states-side forest home, where he strolls alongside a big bear that pees at will, and the glittering Tokyo with its perfectly appointed, exotic interiors, stresses the ambivalent world of a hero who wants to retire but is drawn back into civilization by his mission to be a soldier seeking justice.Because it's an action film, The Wolverine is practically required by law to have memorable set pieces, Mangold doesn't disappoint. The mano a mano fight atop a 200 MPH bullet train is as good as any Bond battle. While the struggle with a giant Iron-Man/Transformers type mechanical enemy (why don't they see how awkward these metal monsters are?) is also a traditional contemporary sci-fi trope, Logan has drawn us so much into this sympathy that there's an extra anxiety in the suspense.Unusual for a summer super hero film, Logan is surrounded by strong, intelligent women such as his tough 'body guard,' Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who has a wildly scarlet wig; and femme fatale Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova and an appropriate stand-in for Uma Thurman), whose serpentine tongue should make most sane men slither away. Come to think of it, she does characterize herself rather humorously: 'A chemist, a nihilist, a capitalist . . . a viper.' Actually I miss the constant joking of a Bond film—there just isn't enough wisecracking as when Logan fights Viper and says, 'I can do this all day, you twisted mutant bitch!' As effective as these mutants are, when Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen arrive on the scene, I am exultant. Nothing like seasoned actors exuding wisdom to make a critic cry in happiness. I'm satisfied to have a thoughtful and fun actioner toward the end of summer while feeling comfortable that Logan will return: 'A lot of people have tried to kill me... and I'm still here.'",Null,5,12,28 July 2013
Win Win," A Winner
","I enjoy Royal Tenenbaums, Juno, and Little Miss Sunshine because they're about eccentric, witty people whose foibles are made less than tragic, their dialogue hypnotizes, and their personas seduce. Then comes Win Win, not as ingenious or innovative as those films but a winner in its own right because it embellishes little while it stays real and lovingly humane.A little like my family and other interesting neighbors, Win Win has love to spare. Mike (Paul Giamatti) has a failing law practice, moonlights as a high school wrestling coach, and now becomes custodian of elderly Leo Poplar (Burt Young) because Mike needs the $1500 a month. Soon complication arrives with bleached blond Kyle (Alex Schaffer), Leo's grandson, who wants to live with Leo.Mike is thus faced with more complications than he bargained for in the caretaker role, yet a bit of light shines through as he deals with the taciturn Kyle, who happens to be an excellent wrestler. Mike's relationship with his wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan), is rich with respect between both and patience on her part as she helps Mike through his ethical challenge and his guidance of Kyle.Nothing comes easy in this dramedy, as it doesn't for most of us, but the beauty of this film is that it slowly works out all the kinks of life in a slowly distributed narrative with triumphs and setbacks that seem to come naturally. Because the central characters are loving and largely benign, the film has an easy, unforced quality.Terry (Bobby Cannavale) is especially likable as Mike's old wrestling buddy, recently split from his wife, and full of energy to channel as assistant coach helping with their new wrestling star. Cannavale brings an easy charm to the film; he's an enjoyable foil for the schlubby, depressive Giammatti.Although a few swear words, mostly 'f bombs,' are dotted in the dialogue, it is essentially a family where the characters live to love.",Null,25,34,7 April 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," It rises above the rest.
","If you've had enough of Batmen because of the likes of Val Kilmer and George Clooney, then you haven't enjoyed Christian Bale in director Christopher Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and now the superior Dark Knight Rises. Bale brings the anguish and triumph of a real human being who suffers and overcomes his sorrows to fight the forces of evil—the American way.While that way is too often by way of violence in movies, this iteration, where Bruce Wayne returns from self-exile to fight the fearful Bane (Tom Hardy), is more often punctuated by intelligence (in weapon designs and mostly in strategy). In fact, the violence is frequently mundane fist fighting, almost as if to emphasize guile over missile. Sadly, the two battles between Batman and Bane are so dull that I longed for CGI to elevate the sophistication. Body blows hardly satisfy in this high-tech world.Characteristic of Nolan, the bad guys are memorable and formidable: Bane has a mask to remind us of Darth Vader with his power and darkness, actually coming from a pit of darkness as if from some Poe-like tale of terror; Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is witty, slippery, and mercurial while sporting a figure Hathaway must have worked hard to fashion; and the surprise villain, well, is more vicious than the others because of the ultimate disguise (not to be disclosed here for fear of my being thrown into the naughty-critic pit).Then there's Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne's faithful servant, whose soul is almost as tortured as Wayne's. Caine is called on to shed a few tears, which are more believable than all the CGI machines. I wouldn't be surprised if Caine gains an Oscar nomination for supporting role (he won two Oscars already). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's cop, John Blake, he is subtly effective in gaining our sympathy so that he is guaranteed to return in the next Batman production.I am unusually effusive about the acting because it is so good, but I should not forget that themes are always prominent in this series. Global financial failure, loyalties, and warfare; and, of course, the ambiguity of human beings, symbolized by masks, keep this comic-book thriller from sinking in its own weight of explosions and bombast.The Amazing Spider-Man impressed me a few weeks ago because it caught squarely the young person's challenges of self-centered arrogance and growing maturity thorough responsibility. Now The Dark Knight Rises shows the inner struggles of an adult hero racked with doubt, more inclined to forsake responsibility than to save humanity. As for the Avengers, it now looks like a showcase for costumes at a Comic-Con convention.Nolan and Bale have caught the angst of adults everywhere who, when confronted with financial ruin or the need to defend their turf from alien forces, may bail out rather than face down the evils. Despite the questionably-long 164 minutes, the artists of this film have kept every minute interesting, fast-paced, and highly useful to develop a pride of heroes who should keep us entertained for at least next decade.",Null,13,27,20 July 2012

His subsequent incarceration in a cave, culminating in creating the iron outfit not only sets up the rest of his days as super hero but also profoundly changes the way he looks at armament as deterrent.As Stark is played by the mercurial Downey, the sardonic attitude is only a verbal spar away.

The poet (Javier Bardem)) and his wife (Jennifer Lawrence) occupy a mansion that could serve well any such Gothic setting from Frankenstein to Psycho except that it is being rebuilt from a ruinous fire, a phoenix rebirth helped by the construction skills of the wife and the spirit of her youth.Her being pregnant helps the allegory of the artist's creating and complements their apparent devotion to each other in the creation process. The film seems also to be commenting on the dangers of the January-May marriage. He can't write or make love in this sterile time of his career and marriage.Not to worry, for they receive visitors, starting with an ill doctor (Ed Harris) and his stone-cold wife, Woman, who begin to upend the couple's life with fan adoration and frank comments about their marriage. A splendid home-invasion thriller this turns out to be as their loony family and countless fans appear. Aranofsky's Grand- Guignol ending is over the top but effective translating a fearful anxiety the couple has over home invasion.What happens is a mash up of Rosemary's Baby, Black Swan, and Carrie with any other invasion film that becomes more than home busting. Indeed, this tense black comedy is largely a commentary on the challenges of art and partly about troubled marriage. The narcissism of creation and the obsession of the writer to be loved are important motifs of the film as it graphically paints the fall of the house of art.Some audience might grow tired of the Lawrence close ups, which draw us in but also cause us the pain of identifying with her, caring about her more than the artist can. Yet, caring is what art does, close or from afar, writing or filmmaking.",Null,3,9,18 September 2017
Creed II," A thrilling sequel not just about boxing.
","'It may not seem like it now, but... this is more than just a fight.' Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan)Creed II is indeed more than just about boxing. As in the previous seven Rocky-related films, it's all about the people and not just winning or losing matches, be they championships or not. Initially Creed II is about Adonis, son of the ill-fated Apollo Creed, having a child with singer Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and challenges about the baby's potential hearing handicap possibly inherited from mom.That's the fight in the first part, not terribly exciting and tedious at times. When the film moves on to the re-match fight between Creed and Viktor Drago (mountainous Florian Munteanu), the film crackles with anticipation as Creed must defend his world title against an antagonist who covets the approval of his country and his family after his father, Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) lost to Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) three decades ago.Although Creed II could be taken as a tract about letting the past go, it is far more about having faith in oneself and putting family first. Lightly-experienced director Stephen Caple shows himself quite capable of filming fight sequences with ballet and emotional qualities not seen in rougher depictions such as in Raging Bull.Co-writer Stallone, as he has done with previous Rocky stories, is adept at wringing sentimentality and wisdom out of the dialogue. Ivan laments to Rocky what his defeat cost him in Russia: 'Because of you... I lose everything. My country. Respect. You ever see stray dogs in the Ukraine? They go for days without food. People spit on them, they are nothing. No home. Only will to survive... to fight.' Stallone thus invests his antagonist with sympathy while he provides the reason for Ivan's fierce desire to win.As the most recent iteration of the Rocky myth, Creed II is serviceable and at times poignant. The glue for this modest greatness is Sylvester Stallone, a writer of note and a one-note actor who nonetheless imbues the champ and his progeny with grit and hope.",Null,0,2,27 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It's messy and long, but you'll not be bored.
","'Black and blue. Fight night. The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world. God versus man. Day versus night! Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham!' Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg)Lex Luthor's description of the battle in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is just about right: Way too much is expected thematically when director Zach Snyder and buddies lard this super-hero opera with special effects and colorful characters too many to do any one of them justice. The best of Lex's phrases is 'God versus Man' because more than once do writers Chris Terrio and David Goyer interject ideas about the notions of infallibility and accountability for whatever god we worship, mostly represented by Superman.Maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe this super clash is really about the villain, best represented by Lex. In that case, the story is a hot mess of colliding motives, paramount of which is the boyish fun of making things go wrong, much like an adolescent version of Iago, who ruined Othello because he could (or like Bill Clinton who played like a boy in the infamous White House tryst because he 'could.') At any rate, I prefer a Zod (Michael Shannon), whose sole purpose was to protect Krypton.However, B v S has some nice moments, mostly when Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is around, as when the titular heroes ask each other if she was with him. When she tells Bruce Wayne, 'I don't think you've ever known a woman like me,' I was convinced she was right, and I could look forward to her own Justice League segment to come.Those quips remind me of the singular DC Comics characteristic that disappoints me—no sustained sense of humor. While Lex Luthor is assuredly meant to supply it, Jess Eisenberg delivers his lines like a petulant boy pushing impotent jokes (think of Gene Hackman's classic sneer and irony dripping lines). Even when Eisenberg says, 'The Red Capes are coming! The Red Capes are coming!' it's so lightly tossed off amid much louder noise that its wit is lost. In other words, I'm a Deadpool critic, lusting after the acidic asides that capture the fantasy of this whole comic-book hero concept. When Lex says, 'Boys! Mmm! Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha! I love it! I love bringing people together! How are we?' I am reminded about how much I love the asides that smartly capture theme. I'm hoping DC will lighten up like Marvel for the next 10 installments through 2017—I may be inflating the number, but I'm into hyperbole as much as the next fan boy.'You know, it's true what they say about little boys: born with no natural inclination to share.'

Toy Story 3," Not a cheap plaything.

Toy Story 3 has all the stunning visuals of its ground-breaking first story 15 years ago, but now it seems dedicated to developing character and crafting first-rate dialogue (see above), and I'm saying that without considering the deft use of 3-D, which doesn't distract yet seems to lend richness, like its characters.Toy Story 3 boasts the returning voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as Woody and Buzz, who, with other famous toys like Jessie, the Potato Heads, Rex, Ken, and Barbie, are abandoned to day care while Andy goes to college. Empty nesters will identify with the sense of loss for the toys, constant partners of Andy.

Signs," This is a likeable film suitable for everyone at the end of a hot summer-as soon as we can get those corn crops in the sooner we can forget the lessons etched in their signs.
","Signs,' directed by M. Night Shyamalan of `The Sixth Sense' and starring Mel Gibson, echoes `War of the Worlds,' `Field of Dreams,' and numerous `B' Sci-Fi's whose message about fate and faith is more important even than scaring the bejesus out of us.The film emphasizes Gibson's character's loss of faith and rejection of his role as a priest after his wife's tragic death. The titular `signs' are formations in the cornfields apparently made by aliens as coordinates for an invasion. Those familiar with Erik von Daniken's `Chariots of the Gods' will be in familiar territory; those who liked the mystical crop field of `Field of Dreams' will recognize its father-and-son reconciliation theme and its declaration that faith is a commodity in short supply.Mel Gibson underplays effectively while Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin support with intensely-felt connections to their brother and father respectively. The first half of the film is suspenseful distributed exposition slowly leading to clarity about what the aliens are doing and what adjustments Gibson's character must make to deal with them and his family. The film s conclusion reverts to some standard sci-fi hokum meant to resolve an otherwise impossible situation for a writer.`Signs' is a cautionary tale about believing in powers greater than ourselves whose signs are all around us; it also asks us to understand the cooperative nature of survival, the bonds of humanity that transcend cynicism and doubt.  This is a likeable film suitable for everyone at the end of a hot summer-as soon as we can get those corn crops in the sooner we can forget the lessons etched in their signs.",Null,0,2,31 July 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Closer with his Three Graces
","'An easy attainment makes love contemptible; a difficult one makes it more dear.' 'Nothing prevents a woman from being loved by two men, or a man from being loved by two women.' From The Art of Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus (Late 12th Century) The Woodman has found a home, and it's not Manhattan. After a brief time in London, Woody Allen has landed in Spain, Barcelona to be precise, and he is more lyrical than he has ever been before with his new romance, Vicky Cristina Barcelona. The film and the city allow the director to be young and creative, attributes in short supply for most artists on the short side of 70. This light-hearted but philosophical romantic comedy deconstructs love in all its maddening irony only to end just as romantically as it began. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) visit Barcelona with very different attitudes toward romance, Vicky a pragmatist engaged to be married and Cristina a wandering sybarite in search of love. As if in some medieval allegory, they meet love in the form of painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who woos them both and other desirable young things as if they were the very life of his art, as if he could not live without their sensuality. They all find a restlessness where nothing can satisfy like the love they can't have. Medieval courtly love as codified by Andreas Cappelanus comes to mind (see above), in which unfulfilled love is the only romantic love. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is framed by a narrator who lends an almost travelogue feel to the proceedings as he explicates and narrates what we don't see on screen. Although I usually favor a narrator's insight, a colleague reminds me her creative writing class warned to show, not tell. She may be right in this case even though the lilting pace mitigates the depressing role of infidelity with the major players. The cinematography is as lush as Juan's lovers, who are capped by the older but far richer character, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). Allen also peppers his backgrounds with Gaudi, the Catalan architect who even more than Miro represents the romantic spirit of Spanish art and individualism. Although Allen doesn't have the answer to what women want as Chaucer did, he comes closer with his Three Graces--Vicky, Cristina,and Maria.",Null,1,6,19 August 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," An exemplary example of the complications of creation and collaboration.
","P.L. Travers: No, no, no, no, no! 'Responstible' is not a word! Richard Sherman: We made it up. P.L. Travers: Well, un-make it up. Richard Sherman: quickly hides sheet music to 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.'1964's Mary Poppins was as iconic as a film could get: its quirky songs were hummable, its language inventive('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'--You get the idea), and the spirit of P.L. Travers' original work was enhanced through those songs and the ineffable magic of Walt Disney (Tom Hanks). Saving Mr. Banks chronicles Walt's 20 year courtship of the stodgy Brit author (Emma Thompson) for rights to the film.Of course, the film is partly a promotion of 'the happiest place on earth,' (Disneyland) and partly a syrupy paean to the Disney goodness concept; however it is also a seemingly honest depiction of the difficulty Walt had convincing the conservative Travers to sign over the film rights. Half the fun is watching the songwriting brothers Sherman, playfully played by B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman, try to convince Travers (who had final say) that a spoonful of catchy tunes could translate her beloved Mary Poppins to the screen.As director, John Lee Hancock assuredly navigates between Travers' hard life in Australia and the travails of creating a film, Saving Mr. Banks is as much about the challenges of creating popular art as it is about the challenges of bringing an author to deal with her work on film. Or more to the point, to deal with the memory of her charismatic, poetic, alcoholic father, whom Disney astutely, albeit late, sees as the center of Travers' ambivalence about giving her creation over to Disney. No matter the accuracy of this version, when the author has the power to sign over rights or not, the producers' role is challenging and frustrating. Walt does not give up even if he has been at it for 20 years, and the film successfully shows why Disney is arguably the most powerful name in cinema. To the film's credit, Travers remains a crusty Brit to the end, no Hollywoodized version of a convert to Disney Studio's sweetness, and Walt is as I remembered him: avuncular and determined to bring happiness and goodness to the world, especially children, through art. See this film to get the challenges of popular art and the supremacy of goodness and a belief in something like a miraculous nanny.",Null,2,5,21 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," An amusing and poignant Nazi satire echoing Mel Brooks and Roberto Begnini.
","'Yeah, I know, definitely not a good time to be a Nazi.' Yorki (Archie Yates)As Nazi youth in Jojo Rabbit are caught in bad times just before liberation, so too is the campy film caught tonally between the lyrical fantasy of Springtime for Hitler and the heavy mockery of Inglourious Basterds. But not to fear, Jojo's (Roman Griffin Davis)
imaginary friend, Hitler (director Taika Waitti), is an ineffectual bumbler, who gives Jojo solace in rough times.If you hate Hitler, you'll enjoy the satire; if you love him, well, you can enjoy news about your favorite dictator and skip this satire.Jojo, himself an ineffectual and impossibly cute 10-year-old, not only has to face the dwindling power of the Reich but also the fact that his mother, Rosie (Scarlet Johansson), is harboring a young Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie).Anne Frank anyone? Like so many participants in that WWII scenario, Jojo must decide between party loyalty and humanity when he decides whether or not to report Elsa.In the first part of the film, so much is lighthearted (think Hogan's Heroes or Life is Beautiful), that you could forget the baseline horror, which the film treats as Wes Anderson might with serio-comic attitude. Helping to lighten things is hipster anachronistic dialogue like 'intense' and 'correctamundo' and slapstick set pieces that ease the inevitable tension from hinting at Holocaust.The second part turns melancholic when Jojo decides what to do with his 'girlfriend' Elsa and the Allies are about to change everything. The tone is right, between the uncomfortable struggle before the allies arrive and the new freedom that will demand a maturity and independence Jojo has never had under the Nazis.Writer-director Taika Waititi has crafted a powerful yet delicate comedy of the world's most horrible story. For attempting to satirize Nazis and be poignant and positive, he should be praised. For the feel-good ending, he should again be rewarded, even if it feels counter intuitive given the horrific history.'You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a ten-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club.' Elsa",Null,7,19,24 October 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Sartre and Satire
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is acclaimed director Wes Anderson's first animation, specifically stop-motion, and it's, well, fantastic. George Clooney's voice as the head fox of an animal clan that shouts diversity is straight out of Danny Ocean-- cool and witty with an overlay of sentimentality that would convince you to open your hen house door to let him have his way. That's after his little speech that tries existentialism on for size, foxwise that is: 'Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I?'As the animals pull a caper against farmer Bean (Michael Gambon) and his thugs, the animation pulls away from the gloom of another winner this year, Where the Wild Things Are, and confirms the fun of a well told beast fable with loads of anthropomorphism to reaffirm our love of humanity and confirm that animals, like us, will always be animals. The ease with which Anderson/Clooney convince that this stealing and mayhem are what animals do is a tribute to script and performance that seduce us into the stylistic den of thieves known as the fox lair and all its attitude and custom, sanctioned by mother nature herself.Mr. Fox: 'The cuss am I? Are you cussing with me?' Badger (Bill Murray): 'No, you cussing with me?' Mr. Fox: 'Don't cussing point at me!' Such an exchange is indicative of the fun Anderson has with kids and adults by not bombarding the youngsters with profanity but winking at the adults as if to say, 'You know what I mean.' And the most violent moment comes not from scenes with guns but rather where the animals steal chickens and break their necks, done so gingerly and quietly that it seems what it is: Just what foxes do and what humans must do to eat the chickens. Darwin meets the cartoons: Mr. Fox: 'And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?'That's Wes Anderson for you: Sartre and satire with a dash of dashing fox.",Null,103,130,25 November 2009
Son of Saul," See it. You'll never forget it.
","'You've betrayed the living to help the dead.' Some Holocaust movies are invariably held up against a realism template and fall short largely because that 'banality' is not at all banal—it is unimaginably gruesome and impossible to translate onto any screen. Yet, Son of Saul, while heavily dosing its story with the horror, succeeds because the physical terror is kept in the background and the individual suffering in the foreground.Saul (Geza Rohrig), a Hungarian Jew, as a Sonderkommando, bought a few months of life by taking a job stripping the valuables from those who were being gassed and burning the bodies. He travels most of the film looking for a rabbi to say prayers for his son's secret burial. The introductory quote shows what another Jew thinks of Saul's mission.Although we never know if the body is that of his son, the allegorical underpinning is clear: An act of humanity will arise somewhere in this inferno.Director Laszlo Nemes skillfully navigates his camera glued to Saul through Auschwitz, tightly hanging on to the protagonist's face as he searches. In some ways, I was reminded of the traveling 'one take' camera in Birdman.The uniqueness of this journey is that the major horrors like gassing, burning, and burying are frequently kept in a background blur (no deep focus here) so that the humane hero can be unimpeded in his own final solution. While there are distinct minor characters, the film is wholly owned by Saul, a surrogate for us, who witnesses atrocities but remains undeterred in his quest.Like Night and Fog, the most powerful of documentaries, and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, the most child-like fiction, this film needs not crush us with realism; rather it lets us see and hear death faintly without revolting us or sending us into deep sadness. Not necessary because our imaginations will do the heavy lifting.",Null,1,4,11 February 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," 'Reductio Ad Absurdum . . .'
",". . . Or 'How low can you go?' Live Free or Die Hard, the third child after the original Die Hard and the sequel,Die Hard With a Vengeance, takes to absurdity the suspension of disbelief required of most action/thriller movies. Only in wonder can one watch John McClane (Bruce Willis) survive wrecks and bullets that would have laid low entire armies, taken to the extreme in this edition by dodging a jet's missiles at close range and surviving a falling bridge. His fight with a martial-arts- proficient operative (Maggie Q), with the attendant wisecracks about her prowess, is a humorously satisfying part but still over-the-top action.Perhaps the saving grace of the film, besides Willis's enormous charm as a blue collar, steely NYPD senior detective, is the central struggle with sophisticated international techno-terrorists over the cyber infrastructure of the USA. While it's all dazzling typing and glittering laptop screens, the real suspense comes from a simple, subterranean fear that too much of our security now rests with computers that regulate everything from electricity to economy. Hackers are harpies or heroes but no longer bit players on the world terrorism stage, fantasy movie or reality.When the caustic but loving interplay between McClane and his feisty daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), emerges as a winning conflict in an overwrought action film, I wonder if this genre has run its course and returned to a formula that always works: family values.",Null,4,39,27 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," About as perfect a science fiction feast made from comic-book ingredients as I could have hoped for.
","`X-Men 2,' the sequel to `X-Men,' is about as perfect a science fiction feast made from comic-book ingredients as I could have hoped for.  Granted it may not have the cultural impact of the first ( a challenge for sequels, especially those adapted from comic books), and it may be too long by about a half hour, but there are intriguing themes like acceptance of differences (mutants) and the equality, maybe superiority, of women (Some of the most powerful mutant activity comes from women).Although the old `good versus evil' motif is a staple of most successful sci-fi, `X2' Director Bryan Singer (`X-Men,' `The Usual Suspects') has the good fortune of Brian Cox as the very evil William Stryker, dedicated to revenging himself on head mutant professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and destroying all mutants.  The government is determined to neutralize the mutants by putting forth the `Anti-Mutant Registration Act,' which would effectively eliminate any peaceful co-existence. The parallel with John Ashcroft's ambitious `rounding up all the usual Mid-Eastern suspects' comes immediately to mind.The special effects in `X2' are as good as the best out there, the minor women as smart and versatile as any `Avenger' or `Charlie's Angel' (for example, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mistique, the shape-shifter with a brain and a strong shape), but the leads are even more astounding.  Besides the always-interesting Stewart, Ian McKellan is the wicked but loveable Magneto, and Alan Cumming is the satanic teleporter, Nightcrawler. Even Anna Paquin in a thankless role as Rogue is able to establish a presence. Hugh Jackman as the irresponsible but attractive Wolverine should remain the audience favorite and the most human of the mutants.As our WCBE operations manager reminded me, casting plays a significant role in sci-fi flick success: Stewart and McKellan are the examples here. But more than their presence are the themes, the imagination, and the energy to make it all distinctively `X.' As always, the Bard says it best:

The Ringer," Some laughs and much respect
","'It is in the comprehension of the physically disabled, or disordered . . . that we are behind our age . . . . Sympathy as a fine art is backward in the growth of progress . . . .' Elizabeth Stuart Phelps The Ringer is worth seeing just to figure out how a comedy centered on The Special Olympics could even be made, much less supported by the organization. I was pleasantly surprisedthere are some laughs and muchrespect where condescension could have been the comic device.Johnny Knoxville's Steve is in a nowhere job, when he gets into a situation that demands a considerable sum of money. His shady uncle Brian Cox devises a plan to have Steve enter the Olympics as a special needs person in order to throw over the reigning champ and thereby cause considerable gambling winnings. The situation requires Knoxville's Steve to become 'Jeffy' and walk carefully between humor and extreme political incorrectness. He succeeds by underplaying gags and lightly sprinkling the sweetness.Of course, there's Steve's love interest, Lynn (Katherine Heigl), with whom the scenes sometimes stretch too long. But the moments with his handicapped buddies are alive with warmth, self effacement, and wisdom enhanced by the problematic notion that special people shouldn't be smart but are. Herein lies the essential irony of the premise: The humor is too often grounded on our preconceived notion that disabled people can barely utter a sentence. Does the humor of their actually uttering bright thoughts come from that prejudice? In order to accept the premise that special people can be funny because of their disabilities, I had to suspend an automatic reaction against the inherent incorrectness.A moment showing how truly inspired this comedy could have been occurs when Steve trains to become 'Jeffy.' He's watching videos that include Rain Man, I am Sam, and The Best of Chevy Chase. The last video raises the immortal observation that the inmates are sometimes saner than their captors.",Null,8,22,22 December 2005
Lucy," The fourth strong sci-fi this summer (Snowpiercer, Dawn of The Planet of the Apes, I Origins are the other 3)
","'That's your best friend and your worst enemy - your own brain.' Fred DurstLucy is a summer surpriseâ€”a sci-fi with brains and humor directed by Luc Besson, whose talents I first spied in the strong woman flick, la Femme Nikita. The titular heroine, played by Scarlett Johansson (carrying on from her other intriguing sci-fi this year, Under the Skin), begins as a hapless woman caught in a drug deal, whose drug she is forced to carry as a mule. Spillage gives her brain powers undreamed of.This drug increases her brain function incrementally until she finally uses all of it. At stages higher than the usual human 10% or so usage, she has insights and telekinetic abilities that neutralize tough guys and engage intellectuals, mainly Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who has been theorizing about the brain's potential for years. The reality of the increased brain usage in Lucy is almost more than he or the world can bear. The super power action could remind audiences of The Matrix's arcane philosophy and action.Besson deftly plays between violence and humor, the opening sequence the most hilarious when the bad guys corral Lucy, who begins to feel her power and uses it on the Asian thugs, who scarcely can believe this white woman tornado. Intercutting between Lucy's slowly realizing her accelerating brain functions and Professor Norman's lectures on the brain's underused capacity, Besson keeps the film moving at thriller pace while educating the audience on the potential of underused intelligence.As usually happens in most thrillers, but not always sci-fi's, chases are too abundant, either in cars or on foot. The car chase where Lucy drives through Paris is unusually creative, more keystone Cops than James Bond, but ingenious enough for me to mention action I usually ignore in reviews.In the end, it's not the guns or the beautiful Johansson that interests me; it's the philosophical contrast between our need to love and our thirst for more knowledge and experience. After all, that knowledge compromised Adam and Eve, and by extension all of us, and Lucy's increasing wisdom would seem to put us in a similar danger.

Amélie," Life will be magical if Amelie is in charge of the event.
","The French romantic comedy `Amelie' has been a big hit in Europe, so I approach it with respect and an eagerness to prove 50 million Frenchmen wrong. Somebody needs to watch the eponymous Amelie closely: she's a little troublemaker with a big heart, and if you don't watch her, she'll steal the gnome from your garden and then your heart. Amelie commits her grandest scheme by trying to connect with an introverted porno store clerk through a series of clues and coincidences that would make Tom Twyker envious.  In fact, the frenetic pace of Twyker's Lola, as she races for love, seems to have influenced director Jeunet. The romantic ingenuity of `Moulin Rouge' with its lovers' dreamlike pursuit of each other is here as well.I am distracted, however, by the conscious effort to ingratiate, both in the way-out vignettes (like sending a fake final love letter from a dead husband to a forlorn wife) and the many close-ups of the lovely, bemused Amelie. It is like watching `Life is Beautiful' for the 10th time-the bloom has long ago blown off by the film's obvious campaign to be relentlessly cute.Paris, however, is another story.  Montmarte is lovingly photographed, not expressionistically as it was in `Moulin Rouge' but spiritually; anything can happen anywhere, and it will be magical if Amelie is in charge of the event.",Null,1,3,11 November 2001
Moonrise Kingdom," Playful and Profound
","'I love you but you have no idea what you are talking about.' Sam (Jared Gilman) Nobody but director Wes Anderson, not even the brilliant Pixar crew, can perfectly capture the whimsy of growing up in a flawed society that leaves us still longing for the experience. In Moonrise Kingdom two twelve year olds, Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) and Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman), 'elope' and see the world.Although that adventure doesn't take them far from their 1965 New Penzance Island in New England, it serves as an introduction to first love and the beginning of an adult world of rebellion and independence, one they won't join just yet. Typical of Anderson, the current adults are slightly off center, played with detachment and eccentricity by Bill Murray (an Anderson favorite) and Frances McDormand as Suzy's parents, Edward Norton as the loving taskmaster scout master Ward, and Bruce Willis as clueless police Captain Sharp. They and a group of talented players capture Anderson's quirky sense of reality, a world where a scout master smokes a cigarette in front of the campers and a mother takes up with the unsharp Captain Sharp.The youngsters' defection brings out the best leadership qualities in scout master and police chief, who relish the hunt for the errant kids. With Benjamin Britten and Hank Williams providing Alexandre Desplat lilting and theme-driven music, Anderson creates a believable but highly irregular universe, where kids can make mistakes and be better for it while adults look a bit silly but retain a modicum of dignity.A storm right out of The Tempest upsets all plans of escape for the two heroes and retribution from the adults, but it serves dramatically to even out lives that might have been stormy for a long time to come. Such is Prospero Anderson's world, off center yet spot on with its understanding of the yearnings of both children and adults as they awkwardly but romantically adventure into life.",Null,1,2,22 June 2012
Midway," Beautiful mayhem.
","The Hurt Locker, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket: quality war films that exceed Midway in story-telling originality but not in astonishing graphics and fidelity to the facts.If you had a hunch that Midway is another Roland Emmerich eye-porn spectacle that defined that genre along with Michael Bay (whose Pearl Harbor could have learned a lesson or two from Emmerich), you are right. Midway takes a well-known and revered battle in WWII and milks as much clichÃ© and melodrama as possible.Yet there is a wholesome honesty about this spectacle, a desire to tell it like it was that makes you feel you are witnessing the countless small decisions by admirals and pilots to bring the formidable Japanese to their knees. Pilots falling from the sky and Japanese carriers sinking to the bottom with their heroic admirals all seem real and heart-rending. Emmerich and writer Wes Tooke depict the deal deciders with their hubris and humanity in sharp detail.Midway will not be on the Oscar finalist list, for it is too formulaic a war film and deficient in deep character development, but what it has is a firm grasp of the historical details and a dedication to showing the difficult decisions that rely partly on gut and valor. Moreover, the CGI battle scenes are remarkably realistic.If you have a great grandpa who rode a dive bomber at a Japanese warship and refuses to talk about the experience, then see Midway to get the authentic feeling of being in battle. And besides, the CGI and overall visuals are what Americans get right, despite Japanese brilliance in animation and cinema in general.

Once again the Star Wars world lights up with the youthful vigor it showed for the first time in 1977.Director J.J. Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan and his crew have crafted a space opera that not only replicates the original by having its major players return as elder statesmen: Solo, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), but it also adds attractive new comers as if they were replacing the last three. Pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is like a new Solo, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is like a much more active Leia, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is like the less formidable Darth Vader. They are all fitting new heroes, promising the series life for years to come.This time the good guys of light, The Resistance, are fighting the well-organized forces of the dark, The First Order. The good vs. evil is nothing new in its motifs and attitudes, but the characters within are full of life and individuality, even the bad guys. Above them all is the swashbuckling Solo, played with such finesse and charm by Ford that you may long to have him front and center in the subsequent chapters. Yet, the melancholic feel you have watching him do his smart-alecky turn is recognizing you must let him go to the newer model—that's life, and that's the humanity underlying the swagger of him and the film.When Solo and Leia meet, these two veteran actors underplay with tenderness for each other and presumably their careers that thoughts of them as disposable and old school are dispelled. She is after all, a general in the resistance and he the same old adventurer. George Lucas sure knew what he was doing. Now it's not his anymore but a brilliant Force called Disney.",Null,3,22,20 December 2015
RED," Spot-on casting
","'I was hoping you'd have hair . . .' Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) We know Bruce Willis doesn't have hair, but like his reluctant companion, Sarah, on a picaresque around America, we think he's cool because of the lack. And so Red goes, a comedy-adventure about the CIA pursuing one of its retired agents, Frank Moses (Willis), who needs to consult with old friends to find out why he's a target.A slick comic-book adaptation, Red (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) carries off its satire of the action genre with spot-on casting and never a moment of taking itself seriously. Not that I ever doubted Willis can't handle a younger partner (see Moonlighting) as he does here with Parker in one of the year's best pairings, superior to the also reluctant Cameron Diaz with Tom Cruise in the similar Knight and Day, which had Cruise as a rogue operative and Diaz as the potential romantic partner. Willis and Parker are just more relaxed about the violence and love mix.It's the supporting cast that makes this movie so much fun, from a gun-toting ex-assassin played by ever-attractive Helen Mirren to a sodden Russian mobster played with relish by Brian Cox, but not to neglect Richard Dreyfuss as another heavy with a light touch. All are having fun (Ernest Borgnine makes an appearance as well), adding to the growing thesis that aging stars still are as bright as ever, and maybe brighter than the younger crop of hyper Bournes and Bonds.More than one critic has labeled the Expendables, Gran Torino, Bucket List, et.al. as geri-actioners, and I like the tag",Null,1,8,15 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Goodbye, Harry, Prince of Summer
","'I never wanted any of you to die for me.' Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) There goes a decade of Potter watching, a 20 hour marathon of magic wands and ripening kids. Not a bad run (billions of dollars later) with characters likely to stay in our popular culture imagination indefinitely.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, we see what happens when Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) gets the Elder Wand, one of the three components of the Deathly Hallows that will give him omnipotence. My consistent criticism of the series has been its reliance on pyrotechnics when the intellectual combat is more rewarding. But then J. K. Rowling's series is about and for adolescents who live through the magic of being young and the youthful adults who people the theaters and read the books with them.In this final chapter Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) are locked in the final battle with the Dark Lord, Voldemort, specifically trying to destroy his three Horcruxes and therefore his hold on immortality. Through all the fireballs and flame throwing, the most important element for me is the presence of death, even alluded to in the last part of the Dark Lord's name. The film carefully and maturely considers what James Joyce called the 'melancholy unity between the living and the dead.' Not only must Harry face his imminent death, he must also learn about the great circle of human sympathy that extends to the dead, with hands held out, so to speak, in brotherhood. Yes, we do see Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and Harry's parents again, shades that they are, but substantial ones who stay with Harry in his final moments, as all our departed loved ones do in our minds.The film is ultimately about growing up to meet the challenges of adulthood and death. It all ends with just the right emphasis on the circle of life and the reality of death.Hats off to an enduring series that has asked kids to face maturely the biggest issues of life and have magical fun at the same time.",Null,1,4,13 July 2011
Unbroken," Maybe his life is just not suspenseful. Not!
","Director Angelina Jolie has adapted Laura Hillenbrand's great biography, Unbroken, and made a conventional story about one of America's true heroes, Louis Zamperini. I'll continue to think about how Jolie could have made this more suspenseful, considering Louis was an Olympic runner, stayed in a life boat for the world record 47 days, and survived torture in two Japanese POW camps.Although the film shows Louis to survive unbroken, despite the-Passion-of-The-Christ-like torture overdose, and follows his life story accurately, there's no soul, just dutiful recounting of the separate incidents. As a colleague commented, the real life footage of Louis returning as an old man to run the Olympic torch is more engaging and emotional than the whole film.The cinematography of the renowned Roger Deakins is splendid on land and sea while Alexandre Desplat's music swells with romance at the right times. Otherwise, it's business as usual—get the history right. For me, a filmmaker could play with the story to make it more meaningful and involve more emotion if she has to—and Jolie has to.The mediocre writing, that includes work of the Coens and the screenwriter of Gladiator, William Nicholson, repeats this trite line, 'If you can take it, you can make it.' Also this line, 'One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,' doesn't sound right, whereas in the book, it does: 'A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain.' Now that makes sense.The villain, called Bird, should be a ruthless torturer with emotional issues tied to his lack of promotion and homosexual longings. However Jolie has chosen an androgynous Japanese rock star, Takamasa Ishihara, who doesn't click as mean or psychotic, just barking torture orders to fill his time with an occasionally enigmatic sentence or two to entice us into thinking we havedepth. Like the film, Bird promises much but delivers too little.As opposed to the boring torture—how about more of his home life or his search for Bird after the war? I want Jolie to do well—she has an exemplary family and solid career as an actress—but, with the negligible first directing effort, In the Land of Blood and Honey, she has yet to achieve as a director.'I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage.'

Munich," A curious simplicity to the film's vision
","Who has not felt how sadly sweetThe dream of home, the dream of home, Steals o'er the heart, too soon to fleet,When far o'er sea or land we roam?' Thomas MooreIf I ask students to name a great living American director, the answer is almost always 'Stephen Spielberg.' And, of course, they're right. With that fame comes the director's obligation to feed the fans high-quality films as well as satisfy their desire to see films characteristic of that director.This film critic brought too much of that expectation baggage to Munich, Spielberg's account of the aftermath of the 1972 Olympic games, in which athlete hostages were murdered by the Palestinian terror group Black September. I hoped for insights into the endless battle between Israel and Arabs. What I got was a high-class espionage tale about Israel's attempt to assassinate the Olympic terrorists one by one and a slight nod to the plight of the Palestinians. Much history, little insight.The pervasive Spielbergean motif of finding home (E.T. for example) is here again in the chief operative, Avner Kaufmann (Eric Bana). After leading a team of 3 others to eliminating most of the terrorists, Kaufmann returns to find life has changed even in his family home, which, like Israel itself, is less safe than when he left on his covert assignment. Here is where the director does his best work by suggesting the endless cycles of crime and punishment, the endless routine of two countries fighting without changing things. 'All this blood comes back to us,' wisely an assassin observes.There is a curious simplicity to the film's vision, as if the horrors visited on each country were the result only, for instance, of two countries trying to secure land they believe is theirs. And even that simplicity belies the hatreds that have seethed for ages, separate from the need for land. My expectations were unmet with Munich: I didn't witness the Spielberg magic of childlike wonder and hope (even those were present in War of the Worlds); I didn't learn much about the complicated conflicts. I'm going to look at Saving Private Ryan to get satisfaction.",Null,12,38,17 December 2005
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The filmmakers have done everything they could.
","'We don't have to destroy her, just her image. Show them that she's one of us now. Let them rally behind that. They're gonna hate her so much they just might kill her for you.' Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as sequel doesn't as much generate heat as it does satisfaction, the sense that the filmmakers have done just about everything they could to keep our attention, draw our sympathy, and entertain us all the while staying close to its iconic source. Here's a young adult adventure that includes a sensible proletariat heroine, an insensitive ruling class, and romance that reflects the vagaries of humanity's quest for love.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), on the eve of the 75th Hunger Games, is still torn between respect for her games partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), and the hunky Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). Director Francis Lawrence keeps the focus on the heroine, who, like the rest of us, is flawed, in her case a destructive disdain for corrupt authority figures, embodied in President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Lawrence and d.p. Jo Willems keep us seeing from her point of view, a smart strategy to humanize the inhuman proceedings of child killing child in ultimate survival gaming.Her answer to her difficulties with Capital authority is to tackle a general and marry Peeta, among other impulses. Yet even with this endangerment, the heroine remains a genuine human being, torn between survival and the nagging feeling that she is meant to save her species. That's a big gap, but the film makes it possible to bridge it in the imagination and reality.Beside the mature performance of Lawrence, who makes a teen torn in love both palatable for adults and almost reasonable, Donald Sutherland is powerful as President Snow, white-haired and bearded, a dark force with an ironic snow-white image. His almost tongue-in-cheek authority plays perfectly behind the devastatingly Nazi-like podium and storm-trooper menace to make the evil just a bit lighter than in real life totalitarianism is. In fact, the film is an unusually effective commentary on repressive regimes, currently too many to count on this planet, and the inevitability of the masses rising up. This second installment of The Hunger Game trilogy gets us closer to the rebellion with a heroine both formidable and vulnerable. That's just so much more human than marvelous superheroes who fly above the rest of us. 'You fought very hard in the Games, Miss Everdeen. But they were games. Would you like to be in a real war?

Looper," Could be a cult classic.
","'This time travel crap just fries your brain like an egg.' (Abe)Not since Children of Men (2006) and Source Code (2011) have I been as jazzed up as I am now about Rian Johnson's Looper. Here's sci-fi that will happily fry your brain as you figure out the implications of changing the future by altering the present. Also throw in thoughts about Christopher Nolan's Memento and Inception to get the flavor of Looper.But as Sinatra sings, 'Regrets I've had a few, but then too few to really mention,' this film challenges you to think of the implications of reversing those regrets or keeping the future the same because you kind of like the way things went.Joseph Gordon Levitt's Joe is a 'looper,' an assassin who goes into the past to murder someone needed to be absent in the future, 2072. The Mob, headed by a very relaxed and dangerous Jeff Daniels as Abe, determines to eliminate all loopers, and Joe is next on the list to kill himself by flashing back. Yes, it's existentially a difficult task, and therein lies the drama of this satisfying sci-fi.With less CGI and few glitzy machines (in fact most of the vehicles look shabby 2012 and the loopers' weapon is a sawed-off Steampunk shot gun—how's that for past and future?), this thriller relies to an effective degree on the excellent cast to relay the challenges inherent in altering any past.Because it's an intelligent tale, the overall theme of responsibility for our actions (the existential part) flows quietly from the action, be it as simple as running from the bad guys to the complexity of deciding on the sacrifices willing to be made to alter the future.A leitmotiv of this film is that no one is immune from the effects of the past, Sinatra notwithstanding in his apparent satisfaction with how things turned out. For Looper, cult status is its future.",Null,9,26,27 September 2012
Footloose," Let's hear it . . .
","'Our Lord is testing us.' Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) Footloose, 27 years later, is alive and well. It may not have the heavy-duty cast of the original (Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, and Chris Penn to name a few), but it is updated smartly with steamier sex, tighter jeans ('If you put a quarter in her back pocket you can tell whether it's heads or tails'), and more suggestive dancing. But the melodrama of a small Georgia town (originally the Midwest) is all there and the religious anchoring, too much so for my taste. The town banned dancing three years ago after a teen-age tragic car accident, and newcomer Ren (Kenny Wormald), from Boston is destined to change attitudes toward the expression of teen-age longing and passion by dancing out his feelings. Along with him are senior high-school buddies, more diverse than ever, who may be just a little too scrubbed but are still a helluva dance group. Most notable is buddy Willard played by the talented Miles Teller with an easy Southern redneck charm and surprising neophyte dancing. If you ask an unhip critic like me, there's not enough of this dancing and too much melodrama. Updating the action with country line dancing ('white man's wet dream') and crumping got me to hoping for more rather than less of the energetic and sexy foot work. Alas, Andie MacDowell as preacher wife Vi Moore needs her face time to be heroic and hip when more break dancing could have done the job. Even Frank Capra seems in on it as Ren gives his righteous speech in front of the town council about the freedom to dance. Let's admit that Footloose is a formula film fulfilling its obligations with good cheer, some splendid dancing, and vividly colored costumes, characters, and sets to take an '80's treasure right into 2011. Although the VW bug remains, director Craig Brewer changes for the better the original tractor chicken standoff to a school bus free for all, and he lets a couple of 10 year olds go all out with the cutest version of Let's Hear It for the Boy you'll ever hear. Let's hear it for smart revisions.",Null,3,12,14 October 2011
50_50," It's a balancing act.
","How does a filmmaker combine humor and drama in a story about a 27 year old man diagnosed with cancer? Easy: Just give them equal measure with the title 50/50 -- light treatment of a dark subject.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to deal not only with his own emotions when he is diagnosed, but also those of a close friend, Kyle (Seth Rogen), an inveterate partier and ribald quipper, and his chronically worrisome mother (Anjelica Huston). Losing his girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) along the way adds to the potential downbeat. Yet director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser keep it all as upbeat as possible, not in small part due to Rogen's constantly funny chatter, which comes at just the right times as the plot gets heavy with cancer surviving techniques (the film turns out to show the way to battle: with humor). Of course, Rogen has had training playing a similar role in Funny People with Adam Sandler. No one plays a weed-smoking buddy better than he. Gordon-Levitt is also an actor who can just about better than anyone else play the soulful, endearing, slow-moving romantic as he did in (500) Days. As a cancer victim, he engages the audience in observation of a vulnerable hero, who fights with a serenity and equanimity that could be a model for those wishing to survive and those who wish to help.50/50 is a comedy with compassion, a distant cousin to the prevalent bromances that rarely treat the support men give each other in times of real danger. Usually it's vacuous women who supply that danger and significant support. Hooray for the men this time.",Null,89,103,28 September 2011
Deadpool," We need this sardonic actioner at this time of year!

DeadpoolRyan Reynolds' titular Deadpool is not like any other superhero; in fact he's an antihero. He murders men and women and murders language as well. Yet, his unceasing banter is sometimes witty and full of cultural allusions, especially to X Men, who would like him to join them.But he's not ready yet, for he needs to track down the baddie, Ajax (Ed Skrein), who gave him a horrible face as a result of an experiment that cured his cancer and gave him supernatural powers. In the course of the pursuit, Wade (Deadpool's civilian name) meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), a dark-haired beauty who makes his life worth living.Most of the film is of course the usual CGI comic-book roughhousing but peppered with so much irony and sarcasm that it's worthwhile just trying to catch half the tossed-off lines. Reynolds is a master of the one liners, many of which can be found in the IMDb sidebar 'quotes.' For example: 'WAIT! You may be wondering why the red suit. Well, that's so bad guys don't see me bleed.' Or 'I didn't ask to be super, and I'm no hero. But when you find out your worst enemy is after your best girl, the time has come to be a f----ng superhero.'

Get Him to the Greek," It's all Greek to me.
","Everything in Get Him to the Greek gets carried over: Director Nicholas Stoller steals broken-down Brit rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from Stoller's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and producer Judd Apatow offers some homoerotic low jokes from Knocked Up with touches of bromance from The Hangover and I Love You, Man.Greek is not funnier by far than any of the recent male-bashing, chauvinistic romantic comedies, but it has moments of rock-star bashing and music industry mashing that save it from true crashing. Russell Brand's Snow is believably degenerate while displaying some wisdom about the world for the innocents abroad with him.Aaron Green (Jonah Hill), a greenhorn intern for a large music company, owned by Sergio Roma (a terrific Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs), is sent to London to bring back for a renewal concert bad-boy Snow in a concert at the Greek Theater in L.A. The mayhem has the usual wanton groupies, drugs in a scatological logistic new even for jaded bromance mongers, and throwing up that is just not pretty or important.Brand and P. Diddy save the movie from boredom, and the issue of doing what one loves gets some play both from rocker Snow and operative Aaron, whose medical intern girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) wants to move for a residency to Seattle. The tension between her as an accomplished young professional and Aaron as a smitten Snow fan, and thus naïve, plays out as a credible argument during the narrative. Snow's attempt to reconnect with previous wife Jackie Q (Rose Byrn) is less believable again because the man seems so much less mature than the woman.That the attractive young Daphne could love the man/boy schlub Aaron is just one of many stretches that melodramatic bromance demands. Rock 'n Roll will survive as will Judd Apatow and immature men. I just hope Daphne becomes a doctor specializing in rock degeneracy. There's a future there.",Null,1,4,6 June 2010
Cloud Atlas," Sci-fi thriller to delight your mind.
","'Just trying to understand why we keep making the same mistakes.' Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) What did I expect from filmmakers responsible for Matrix and Run Lola Run? A complicated, philosophical treatise on humanity—of course! But Cloud Atlas is more than that: It's a convoluted thriller with intersecting segments that eventually spell out humanity's penchant for good and evil, its ability to reinvent itself, and its undying connection down through the ages and into the future: We make the same mistakes, we get better at them, and we sacrifice to make the world a better place.As director/writers Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski, and Lana Wachowski spin the filmed version of David Mitchell's murderous, new-age, sci-fi novel, they create individual stories of oppression and redemption, tied together by the common bond of humanity and some very smooth cross cutting. The six stories, covering the five centuries through 2024, treat slavery of several kinds, care of the elderly, corporate crime, and a robotic working class up to the aftermath of the apocalypse.Although the first hour of the almost three hours is confusing and slow, eventually the characters become recognizable and comprehensible (helped subtly by the same actors playing different parts) to the extent that we care what happens to them and ultimately the human race. Stay for the credits to identify the multiple roles each actor plays (some may surprise you).Going into the film, I had a suspicion that I was going to see a version of Terrence Malick's abstract Tree of Life. Au contraire, Cloud Atlas is an action film about good guys from the past and the future running from bad guys; the key, however, is that everything that happens has ramifications for the past or the future. The weakness of this grand action is that there are too many characters and actions, weakening each with the overlay of the other.Notice I haven't even tried to explain the plot although all strands intersect in humanity's enduring struggle for freedom be it the 24th century post-apocalyptic survivor Zachary (Tom Hanks) joining with a visiting space lady (Halle Berry) or an 1849 runaway slave (David Gyasi) aided by a young sailor (Jim Sturgess). In each segment, slavery of some sort is the catalyst for rebellion. It's hard not to see contemporary parallels in warring states of Africa or even in the great divide between the wealthy and the other percent in the US.Cloud Atlas is not on Cloud Nine: Its adventures may be too many, but its themes are consistent, universal, and real and its actors some of the best of the day.

At some point she becomes the Hester Prynne of the experienced girls, a reference to their currently reading Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter and a testament to the scourging of the ultra-Christians.Lest this seem a bit heavy for 17 year-old teens, the dialogue by playwright and screenplay specialist Bert V. Royal is witty, but not all the time, and timely if a bit over the top. Juno it is not, missing that comedy's acidity, sophistication, and gifted star, Ellen Page. However, the fetchingly-lisped Stone is still better than most young actresses out there playing young, romantic, and comedic.Royal's script has plenty of room for commentary on homophobia and adultery as well as the formula for a wholesome, liberal family life evidenced by Olive's parents, played to happy, flower-children harmony by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. That couple should win a special award for playing the understanding, caring parents we all hoped to be or have, but weren't/didn't. They are marvelous.The thematic weight in this rom-com is with acceptance and truth, notwithstanding the obvious commentary about social communicating best exemplified by Facebook. In fact the entire film is framed by Olive narrating to her website about the rise and fall of her rumor.Easy A, its title ingeniously playing on Hawthorne, should have taken the rich Hawthorne subject more seriously, for there is plenty of comedic material and life-learning going on with the nineteenth century genius's stories.'She had wandered, without rule or guidance, into a moral wilderness.

Fantastic Four," Typically American film-making
","After solid appearances this year of Sin City and Batman, seeing comic book adaptation Fantastic Four is a fantastic letdown: The general idea about four colleagues in the space business undergoing radical physical changes is interesting but the execution is loud and repetitive, and the actors are disconnected from their mission.Spawned from another Stan Lee comic, this film version takes almost the whole film to have the four principal characters, who have been transformed into superheroes by a cosmic storm, come to terms with their new gifts, including being a human torch, stretching your body like elastic, becoming invisible, and being a rock with its attendant strength.It's all typically American film-making with the accent on stunning graphics and de-emphasis on character and story depth.

The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Decisions, decisions
","'I know the consequences of the choices you're making.' Edward to IsabellaAlthough more fight action is apparent in the change from the last sequel (New Moon, 2009), to the new Twilight Saga: Eclipse, it is a film in eclipse—the story is so slow as to make you feel drained of blood, Kristen Stewart (Bella) has even fewer expressions than in previous Twilights, Taylor Lautner (Jacob) seems to have gone from a six pack to a four, and Robert Pattinson (Edward) is less James Dean than when he never had a chance to be like him anyway.In other words, this slow tale of teenage vampires and werewolves in heat has too little heat, but rather is in its own twilight. The close-ups of the brooding teens have proliferated, to the extent that I have memorized Edward's mouth (or lack thereof), Bella's drooping eyes, and Jacob's overly-white teeth. All my memorization occurs because I needed to stay awake during the dullest scenarios since, well, Twilight. Actually I called that one 'enjoyably overcooked.' This one is underdone.Eclipse has an increased emphasis on teenage uncertainty: Bella must decide who she wants to be, human or vampire (a variation of the film's existential subtext), whether or not to marry Edward, and how much she loves Jacob, more specifically, can she love two boys at once. It's authentic teen dilemma centered on fitting in with the crowd and the opposite sex. To the film's credit, she and Edward postpone sex until after marriage because Edward is 'old school' about those matters (as opposed to killing piles of animals each night to sustain his 100 year-old body). When Edward proclaims to Bella, 'Isabella Swan, I promise to love you every moment of forever,' I have the feeling it's a warning to me that at least two more sequels are being planned. I guess that's why the vampires and their movies seem to last so long—the undead and the Twilight continue to suck blood out of pop culture.",Null,138,241,1 July 2010

","'John is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will.'Viggo TarasovYou might say so because infamous hit man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) must have sheer will to splatter the screen with more bodies than can be counted in one sitting of John Wick: Chapter 2. The quick editing and scene design are focused, alright, on pleasing the eye while titillating that part of the brain that ferrets out the unreal. Surreal it is; substantial it is not.Director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad are committed to entertaining and not overtaxing the brain with anything resembling reality. What's real is that Wick is back from retirement to honor a marker, and that puts everyone on edge while some of them delight to think of the mayhem he will unleash.Because Reeves cannot possibly save a film with even adequate acting, the filmmakers have rightly chosen a gaggle of good character actors such as Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, and Franco Nero to name only a few. Additionally, Kolstadt has some witty setups and lines, alas too often centering on Reeves, whose acting chops don't exist. In other words, he kills lines along with lives.Now and then an actor and lines save the film, not often enough: 'Have you thought this through? I mean, chewed down to the bone? You got out once. You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond... you may well find something reaches out... and drags you back into its depths.'

And so it goes in science fiction, no firm answers, even divergent opinions, but a whimsy about the future that catches my imagination every time. Annihilation's complexity could put off those who want answers the text is reluctant to offer. For those who go with the flow, this enjoyable if a bit obtuse sci-fi thriller poses questions about who we are and what an alien force could possibly want with such a flawed species.
The Shimmer is a new sci-fi concept monster about aliens or maybe our own nature conspiring to take over our lives, or duplicate them, Whatever, in the increasingly invasive world of the Shimmer, Lena has signed on with an all-woman patrol to enter the North Florida Area X (really shot in Great Britain forests) to find out the source of the invasion at a remote lighthouse and secretly find out why her husband, now returned from a similar patrol, is so strange.
Although I'm not sure all this weirdness is in Lena's mind, let's assume for the moment it is. I favor the theory that a misguided affair with a colleague caused deep uncertainty about her identity and the fear that her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac), found out about the affair. Suffering and losing identity would be a puritanical punishment for a foolish dalliance.
On a purely sociological sci-fi basis, Annihilation may be about losing our flawed identities to an alien force that means to assimilate and forge new, benign identities for us. Not a bad idea given the toxic political world we live in.

Inside Out is insightful about the emotions of a pre-adolescent girl, and all of us by extension, yet Minions is a sometimes cute, lightweight animation about goggled, puny pills who speak child-like gibberish that now and then throws in a discernible word like 'boss.' As for insight, there is little, like the little people themselves.A 'boss' is what the little travelers are searching for through history until they find permanence with the meanie of the Despicable franchise. The Minions want to serve the worst person in the world, a little like Republicans looking for a leading candidate in a crowded field. Although Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock voice) is a worthy candidate, no one can compete with Gru (Steve Carell).Along the way of history, the best part of the film for me, they encounter notables like T-Rex and Napoleon, who suffer the danger of the little ones' benign benevolence, always tempered by their colossal ignorance. The funniest for me is their exposing Dracula to direct sunlight.The most likable historical figure for me is the current Queen Elizabeth (Jennifer Saunders), whose toothy joie de vivre best exemplifies the light-hearted view of history fostered by directors Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin. The tour of London stereotypes, structures and people, is basic but welcome to this Anglophile.The best insight into humanity is the child-like character of the minions themselves, whose anarchic behavior is not unlike that of most terrible two's.My disappointment with Minions may stem from my being a language person frustrated by the animators' attempt to relay emotion and meaning, a la Chaplain and Wall-E, without words. These pill-shaped heroes don't do it for me except to say, 'Well, at least I'm cute.'",Null,13,24,9 July 2015
Incredibles 2," One of the best ever.
","In Incredibles 2, how does writer/director Brad Bird make a family film that is adventure, thriller, and comedy? Well, he's had practice beginning with Iron Giant and Ratatouille and The Incredibles in between. With three distinct approaches to entertainment he has made a reputation of smart and fun and plain genius all over.Incredibles 2 is super family fun as the family picks up where they left off, specifically leaving a track meet and pursuing The Underminer (John Ratzenberger), who is digging under the city with a giant corkscrew. The importance of this successful sequence is that it's the first time for the family to work as a team in public.It's a regular family going through growing pains and a superhero family trying to reconcile its gifts with a society that the rules against them. That's right, super heroes have been outlawed because they're perceived as adding to the troubles. The answer lies in pursuing the law and changing it more than fighting a strange villain called The Screenslaver, who hypnotizes while you watch. Obviously, a subtheme of this multilayered allegory is the enslavement of the populace to it screens. Yet, Bird does not enslave the audience to theme, e.g., a race sequence in which Elastigirl, Helen Parr (voice of Holly Hunter), chases a hover train taken over to head to destruction is as furious a ride on a motorcycle as you have ever seen.Not all is heavy-duty: Baby Jack-Jack fights a raccoon, funny in himself, with baby showing hitherto unknown powers. The sequence is high humor using a baby as a rib-tickling comedian-hero. Add to this slapstick the light orchestration of composer Michael Giacchino and you have a sci-fi animation with soul.That's the irony of this inspired animation and real life--sometimes even the good has to fight to be recognized, or to be legitimized: 'You know it's crazy, right? To help my family, I gotta leave it. To fix the law, I gotta break it.' (Helen Parr) Incredibles 2 is primarily about bringing back heroes to the public fold and figuring out how to break the law in order to fix it.Furthermore, what's a super mom to do when duty calls and she must leave the family under the untrained care of dad, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson). Bird doesn't make Bob a boob (although there are laughs at his expense), but rather has the rest of the family pitch in to help with major challenge, baby Jack-Jack with hitherto unknown super powers.Bird recognizes the need for dads to fit in the management of the house, for instance, as he tries to untangle a mess with daughter Violet's (Sarah Vowell) date, who discovers she's a superhero. He misses their date, and dad must do some intricate counseling of his head-strong daughter. Even for a superhero, that's a tough challenge.But the super heroism most prominent is that of Mom, as good an example of the best of #MeToo that allows a woman to be empowered publicly and fulfilled privately, with a little help from her family. One of the best films of the year and in the animation canon for all time.",Null,20,65,12 June 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Summer's most wanted animation.
","'Poor animals. Now, you deal with ME!' Capitaine Chantel DuBois (voice of Frances McDormand)Although I miss Fantastic Mr. Fox as much as any contemporary animal fable, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is a lees cerebral but more athletic entry into my canon of animations that satisfy both children and adults. Our heroes, led by the charismatic lion Alex (Ben Stiller), are determined to go back to New York by way of a traveling European circus.If you judge by the quote at the beginning of this essay, you'll note that even the villain, Ciaptaine DuBois, is fun, albeit French, a culture open for satire along with Italy and other vulnerable targets. In fact, DuBois' pursuit of the animals over Europe is a delightful mash-up of goofiness and wit. When she sings Edith Piaf's 'Non, je ne regrette rien,' I confirmed my nostalgic commitment to this animation and acknowledged the brilliance that would integrate that legendary lament.Although this animation is written by Fantastic Mr. Fox's Noah Baumbach, much more slapstick and far faster segments occur than in Fox, making it a lesser production but far more attractive to younger audiences. Even the 3-D shamelessly throws debris at the screen. Attractive to all audiences is a major theme of looking ahead to expanding one's talents and seeing home as another springboard for growth rather than a sedate refuge.",Null,7,13,7 June 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Great music, downbeat hero.
","'...And what, just exist?' Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac)Folk singing in 1961 was far preferable to working the unromantic Merchant Marine, to which the eponymous hero of Llewyn Davis might have to return at the suggestion of his sister, Joy (Jeanine Serralles) and for his lack of success. The Coens have again crafted a tale of a hero not going anywhere but trudging along waiting for something to happen (think Libowski journeying for a carpet).Llewyn sings gallows songs in smoky coffeehouses (one is the real Gate of Horn, which also is a reference to one of Penelope's comments in the Odyssey) and finds a place to crash at night, sometimes with a friend and his wife, whom Llewyn may have impregnated. Along the way he's inadvertently responsible for a savvy orange cat named Ulysses, either a symbol of our hero's wanderings to get home or of Holly Golightly's 'Cat' in need of a home.The film is aimless itself, mostly a pastiche of possibilities for a singer who is good but lacking a spark to take him to the Bob Dylan level, or even remotely to that peak. He's not even smart enough to forsake a quick pay for future royalties from a song he helped produce, Please, Mr. Kennedy.The Coens have set the gloomy scene with a grey mise en scene evoking the faded albums and hopes beautifully lensed by Roger Deakins' substitute, Bruno Debonnel (Deakins was doing Skyfall at the time). While Llewyn's songs are very much in the folk tradition, they do nothing to relieve the despair.Coen Bros fans must see Inside Llewyn Davis regardless of its despair. It evokes an era with gorgeous, somber photography and an eponymous hero in the vein of Libowski or O'Brother. In all, the film is a Homeric demythologizing of an age when Jack Kennedy was still alive and hope had not yet been checked. The film's ending with the same violent beginning presages the dismal cycle of loss that is Llewyn's lot and ours.We have been inside Llewyn Davis and it's not all that pretty.",Null,2,4,18 December 2013
Sin City," Everything a buff could want.
","'By Jove! I've never seen anything so unreal in my life. And earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion.' Joseph Conrad's Marlow in Heart of DarknessFor the comic book geeks who can't warm up to Spiderman 2 and Hellboy film adaptations because they're dated and lack high art, Frank Miller's Sin City has some of the highest artwork ever with characters straight out of Miller's dark, post-modern noirish magazines. The film is broken up into the morbid adventures of three very tough guys in the fictional Basin City and a bevy of scantily clad femme fatales as deadly as the guys. Against a backdrop of a perfectly CGI'd city, this film has everything a buff could want except sophisticated plot, never a demand when artwork dominates. Sin City abounds, however, in themes of honor, lust and redemption, the stuff of hard-boiled film noir. Of the three heroes in three stories, Mickey Rourke as Marv is the most memorable, made up like Hellboy, just as impervious to pain as that bad boy, and tender to his women, albeit they are super efficient at prostitution or assassination, depending on the need. The impressive Bruce Willis is Frank Hartigan, ex-cop on his last day before retirement, looking after the welfare of an 11-year old girl, who just happens to be an attractive grown up 19 when he is released from jail. Don't ask; it's complicated but comprehensible when you view the film. For the women, Rosario Dawson as Gail the hooker Valkyrie is unbeatably tough and gorgeous, and just as dangerous as the men for those traits.The black and white of film noir, which accentuates the broad conflict between good and evil, is splashed with bits of color, especially red blood, and yellow, for that matter. The heroes are about as flawed as a Bogart detective on a bad day, and the women as voluptuous as an R rating will allow before it turns to NC-17. Although the three minimalist plots seem to revolve around some type of revenge, the important element is the evocation of an underworld unremittingly evil, just short of a true hell on earth. Because this is Frank Miller's comic book world, men are riddled with bullet holes but often recover to find revenge another day.Rourke's confrontation with a powerful bishop and his murderous son is a tribute to Miller's vision of a flawed universe, where evil is unchecked and churches are often at the center of corruption. Sounds like today to me.",Null,1,5,25 March 2005
The Ugly Truth," Gin and Tonic
","'And when that I had geten unto me/By maistry all the sovereignetee . . . After that day we hadden never debat!' Wife of Bath, Chaucer's Canterbury TalesFrom Chaucer to Apatow, men have always wanted to know what women want (In the bard's case, it was 'mastery' over men). So The Ugly Truth is a pleasant summer breeze which looks at what men are and what they want. It's a romcom with witty moments (too few for me): Mike: You're all about comfort and efficiency! Abby Richter: What's wrong with comfort and efficiency? Mike: Well nothing, except no one wants to f___it.Its philosophy gently reminds us that although men are from Mars, women may like that just fine, and, whoa, they may not want 'maistry.'Katherine Heigl (Abby) is not quite as bright as she was in Knocked Up, but she is as uptight and controlling. Gerard Butler (Mike), the current rage of chick-flick audiences briefly replacing Colin Firth, is not as lovingly attentive as he was In P.S. I Love You. Although both actors play at a screwball comedy's fast-paced lingo that's not up to the literate caliber of say, His Girl Friday, the attempt is worthy given the paucity of witty comedies this year. The restaurant scene where Abby has inadvertently worn vibrating panties remotely controlled by an unsuspecting kid at another table is amusing (showing Heigl's chops) but misses the impact of Meg Ryan's fake orgasmic scream in When Harry Met Sally. Abby is a wound up morning show TV producer faced with supervising a new talent, Mike, whose cable show The Ugly Truth has a big audience that loves his frank talk about men's libidinous natures and women's manipulation. She hates his macho routine, and he tries to change her into an attractive woman. Do you think they will fall in love? Silly of me to doubt your insight.While the whole movie is a cauldron of clichés and expectations, it has a core of truthfulness about the misperceptions between the sexes. It may confirm the suspicion of some like me that hard-core controlling women could soften their 'mastering' gene, and men could, well, shift slightly into less lecherous and more sensitive Martians. It's summer fantasy fun with ugly truth that goes down like a warm gin and tonic.",Null,0,4,22 July 2009
Gangs of New York," The film should be seen, all 168 minutes, if you care about the arc of this director, the history of New York, and the amazing gifts of Daniel Day-Lewis.
","It's 1863 New York City, prior to Rudy Giuliani and well on its way to being anarchic and lawless beyond any modern imagining. The underworld is ruled by Billy the Butcher, played with cunning, humor, and ruthlessness by Daniel Day-Lewis in an Oscar-possible performance. Leo DiCaprio will win no awards as the vengeful Irish orphan, Amsterdam, but he comports himself well enough to be taken seriously as an actor.The re-creation of 19th century New York at the Cinecitta Studios in Rome is filled with soot, clogged with humans, and choked with detritus to make it both ugly and fascinating.  Director Martin Scorsese's seasoned hand takes a cue from Howard Hawks' `Searchers' by opening a door and letting the point of view camera marvel at the snow-flaked town to be irrevocably changed by the clash of Irish immigrants, led by DiCaprio's dad, Liam Neeson, with nativists, led by the wily Day-Lewis.DiCaprio will try to avenge his dad's death, with the help of a resourceful and randy pickpocket, played with gusto and charm by Cameron Diaz. The revenge is the plot linchpin and its weakness, for it regularly telegraphs the next anti-climax and takes precious emphasis away from development of interesting characters like Day-Lewis, Diaz, and the talented Jim Broadbent as the infamous political sidewinder, Boss Tweed.The rivalry leads to the worst riot in American history, the Draft Riots, a preeminent holocaust that destroyed much of Manhattan at the hands of mobs and navy guns, even the homes of prominent businessmen and publishers. Amid the carnage, made even fouler by The Butcher's surpassing ability to eviscerate pigs and men alike, there seems little hope, except for someday a century and an half later a mayor with guts and cold compassion. Until that time, that great city accepted its pickpockets, prostitutes, and politicos as part of its landscape, caught powerfully by the genius director of `Taxi Driver' and `Goodfellas' among other urban stories.The film should be seen, all 168 minutes, if you care about the arc of this director, the history of New York, and the amazing gifts of Daniel Day-Lewis.

The Cabin in the Woods," A comprehensive shocker
","In The Cabin in the Woods, five college types and their RV visit a remote cabin for a vacation of freedom and relaxation. They are stock characters: Jules (Anna Hutchinson) the promiscuous coed; Kurt (Chris Hemsworth), the athlete; Marty (an outstanding Fran Kranz), the stoner; and Dana (Kristen Connolly), the good girl. After Dana reads an old diary, the red-neck Zombies descend and with them the clichés.Because you've seen The Friday the 13th franchise and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you might think you know what happens in this parody of the horror genre, but you really don't. Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon test your knowledge of the classic tropes and twist enough to create almost a sub-genre—the intelligent spoof that can satisfy a geek's desire to ferret out the most arcane allusions and the regular film goer who likes to enjoy a good scare without deconstructing it.Starting out in Deliverance country as they gas up and get verbally abused by tobacco-spitting gas-station owner, Mordecai (Tim De Zarn as a terrifically stereotyped local), when they get to the abandoned cabin the zombies, et al., descend. If the film had held off the big twist till later, I would have been happier to be scared a few more minutes. But, then, we can enjoy the spoof from early on.Beyond this point, I can only recommend the film because further analysis would disclose too many plot twists. Let's just say, the film ingeniously allows us to be scared while its tongue is firmly planted in it cheek (think Scream). The denouement, with a surprise visit from a horror movie icon, is as absurd as anything previously if not more so. Yet, it seems a right conclusion as it doubles back to first images and explains its bloodbath.By the way, that conclusion is an amalgam of the prominent elements of the genre, masterfully satirized, and fused in mirth-inducing mayhem.",Null,45,88,13 April 2012
Windtalkers," I felt in `Windtalkers' I was at a showing of `Black Hawk Down' crossed with `Enigma'
","John Woo of `Mission Impossible II' can't get enough pirouetting, blasted bodies in flight-I felt in `Windtalkers' I was at a showing of `Black Hawk Down' crossed with `Enigma'-in this case the special Navajo Code is as peripheral as the Enigma Code was to its own movie. This film also rivals `Saving Private Ryan' for blood and guts realism but comes nowhere near `We Were Soldiers' for caring about its characters.In `Black Hawk' realistic warfare was the only concern; in `Windtalkers' Nicholas Cage's struggle with his guilt demons dominates the promising topics of a code that was never broken, the integration of minorities into the culture of the army, and a sergeant, Cage, who must kill his Navajo charge if there is danger of him being captured. Unlike the recent `Enigma,' which ruins the code theme by focusing on the romance, even the romance between Cage and  Frances O'Connor is marginalized to the `going-nowhere' point. Cage is so depressed (remember him in `Leaving Las Vegas'), he can't get excited about O'Connor-that's true depression and not fun to watch for over 2 hours.The cliched-war-story setups are rife-on the eve of a battle, a soldier asks that his wedding ring be delivered to is wife (Do you think he survives?); the redneck bigot, who beats up on the Indian, finds his life in the Indian's hands during battle; helping a child of the enemy brings respect; if you carry a wounded buddy out of harm's way, you will be shot too; Americans are ace shots, rarely missing an enemy, who often comes out of the brush waiting to be shot; and on and on-the cliches are legion.But those opening aerial shots of Monument Valley made me cry with nostalgia-I rode all around the valley on my motorcycle a few years ago. Woo has gone John Ford one better by smoothly gliding through the monoliths to create the mythic connection between the Indians and preservation of the homeland. The lens is artist here-even words can't do it.",Null,0,0,9 June 2002
Spectre," Exciting but not memorable.
","'Why, given every other possible option, does a man choose the life of a paid assassin?' Madeline Swann (Lea Seydoux) 'Well, it was that or the priesthood.' James Bond (Daniel Craig)Such is the ironic staple of most by-the-numbers James Bond flicks. Sarcasm holds limited court in the 24th iteration, Spectre. I'm happy for that, but while I don't want a return to the excessive smarm of Roger Moore, I would like more irony from Craig, just as depicted in the Heinekens commercial when Bond asks the babe if she'd like lunch after a harrowing boat incident.In Spectre, Bond seeks out the head, Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz), of a secret organization, Spectre, whose goal is to have dominion over information, a very smart contemporary quest. Although Waltz plays a little too reserved for my Bond taste, he does present a menace more terrifying because of his civilized veneer. Bond films have always been over the top for me, so underplaying is just not what I like best. Yet, Waltz is effectively villainous.The locales, from Rome to Tangier, are Bond beautiful as they fulfill the implicit bond between fans and the series to take the audience to exotic places with exotic women and exotic plots. As for the women, Madeline is way too sweet, harking back to Diana Rigg's Tracy, who tames Bond in an uncharacteristic blip in his usually libertine life. As for the usually sexy, kittenish girls, Monica Bellucci as Lucia isn't one; rather she is a sexy middle-aged woman who seems right for Bond. This lack of young cats and presence of a mature woman is a welcomed change. Madelaine best characterizes the Bond I love best:'Is this really what you want? Living in the shadows? Hunting, being hunted? Always alone?' To which I respond, 'Hell, yes!'Spectre is boilerplate Bond, fun and improbable, only not enough of either for me. Craig brings a brooding to Bond to give the character nuance; if Craig should decide to leave the series, I would be happy with a hybrid of Connery and Moore to replace him. As the titles attest, 'The dead are alive.' Let's bring back dead Bonds.",Null,1,5,8 November 2015
Joy," Solid cast, fascinating true story of a '70's entrepreneur--a splendid woman.
","Based on a true story, Joy depicts the rise of the titular female inventor and entrepreneur, Jennifer Lawrence, who rose to fame by hawking her Miracle Mop on QVC. The story is much more than about business success, for Joy is a 1970's housewife who supports four generations in her house, including her ex-husband, Tony (Edgar Ramirez).One of the strengths is the sympathetic but realistic tale of more than one failure by a woman who has had enough of it early on in her life. That she is a woman is a card never played by director David O. Russell, who could have legitimately called on it in a time when Joan Rivers and a few other accomplished women were just beginning to break through the ceiling.Neal (Bradley Cooper), the producer of QVC, gives her the first break, but not because she's a beautiful, albeit untried inventor, but because she can sell him on her mop. Even with a businessman father, Joy has serious business setbacks that would have crushed a lesser human. But she is resilient and resistant to awkward attempts to direct her business by an unauthorized sister and his dad's wealthy girlfriend, among others.Although Russell has danced through several dramatic and comedic hits, most with Lawrence and Cooper, I can't remember his intruding the drama with awkward voice over narration by Joy's grandmother (Diane Ladd). The smooth-running film didn't need help from a voice, even if it projects into the future to explain Joy's success to come. Joy is a solid drama peppered with humor and a fine ensemble: De Niro is no stranger to playing a conflicted father with a big heart, and Ramirez does a good Bobby Cannavale from Venezuela.",Null,8,24,24 December 2015
Coach Carter," The excitement is infectious.
","I enjoy glory stories about young athletes beating the odds because of their talent and the tidal force of a strong-headed coach. The 1999 Richmond High School (California) Oilers are celebrated in Coach Carter, and with Samuel L. Jackson (Who else?) as the no nonsense coach with the revolutionary idea that his underprivileged team should carry a 2.3 average, wear ties to games, and adhere to a contract about all these conditions. The carrot, besides playing ball, is that they might go to college because of the student-athlete profile. The reality is that such an arc will lead to the NCAA and maybe the NBA.As in last year's Miracle about Olympic hockey and Friday Night Lights about high school football, the coach is charismatic, uncompromising, and based on a real person. His confession that he failed because he came to teach boys how to play basketball and ended with students who became men is close to the ameliorative spirit of the entire film.Although the formula is secure in the land of sports clichÃ©s, having attractive young people and a bankable tough guy actor play the lead parts results in an enjoyable experience. The excitement is infectious, the values about hard work and integrity far more convincing than all the bromides thrown at us by neocons in the last election.Coach Carter has been played countless times in films but is a pleasant experience if the hackneyed hokum such as the crusty coach and stereotyped players (the surly white Eminem look-a-like, the African American with the pregnant girlfriend, the Latino with drug connections and attitude, to name a few) is handled with care, as it is here.

Moon," Interesting evening with minimalist drama/sci-fi.
","'I hope life on earth is everything you remember it to be.' Computer Gerty (voice of Kevin Spacey)Director Duncan Jones's Moon takes a traditional sci-fi story of a lonely astronaut, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), as it was in Kubrick's 2001 and Soderberg's Solaris, and reworks it as a much simpler story of man surviving with his wit and perseverance. Although the CGI is basic and the exterior sets toy-like, it's the interiority that sparkles with Sam giving the full humanly dose of a man after 3 years mining for energy on the dark side of the moonThe energy company for whom he works is not transparent, for Sam's messages to his wife, Tess (Dominique McEllogott) seem to have gone nowhere and the messages from her peculiarly circumspect. As Sam interacts with Gerty (Hal anyone?), Sam encounters complications both good and bad. This half of the story is realistic and generally warm although Sam is getting edgy to return to family.It's when the clone motif appears that the story gets more interesting and more confusing as we learn who is real, who is clone and more importantly how is Sam # 1 going to get home? Original Sam is deteriorating, new Sam is cocky, and the rescue team arriving soon will not be happy about the clone activity.Actually, it's not all that complicated, and it is full of commonplace challenges for spaceman Sam. Having dealt with computer Hal in 2001, the audience is familiar with the shenanigans necessary to outsmart it, but here the longing for home outstrips the cold loneliness of a Hal's world.The minimalist Moon does the survivalist theme well because nothing distracts us from Sam's quest to wrap up his stay and go home. That home-bound motif is a staple of sci-fi that Moon does well:'You're not going anywhere! You know you've been up here too long man; you've lost your marbles. Whuddya think, that Tess is back home waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie? What about the original Sam, Uh?' Sam #2.",Null,0,0,19 May 2020
Happy Feet," Happy Film
","Tap-dancing penguins could never have been pitched if the mega-hit doc Marching Penguins (2005) had not caught the imagination of every breathing human. Only this time around Happy Feet is not a doc but a high-class animation (from the director of the very humane Babe) and much more anthropomorphic than Marching Penguins because these are tap-dancing penguins.Besides the themes of individualism and environmental destruction, Happy Feet's special effects take animation as close to 3-D as could be possible in a 2-D medium. One scene with frolicking penguins careening down a mountain has the sight and sound of rapid descent so authentic as to make me cringe at each turn for fear of flying off the snow into the sky. The colors are luminous and the long and helicopter-like shots stunning enough to make you feel you're watching IMAX.Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) has no singing voice, so he can't sing a 'heart-song,' the signature croon of a male to attract a female for life. But as Nature frequently compensates, that boy can dance. A hard-to-accept-it dad (Hugh Jackman) laments, 'It just ain't penguin.' The adventures of this hippity-hop outcast bring him to a band of diminutive Latinos headed by a savvy Ramon (Robin Williams), who helps him to find his inner heart-song in his feet and eventually the source of fish depletion (the 'aliens' are a familiar race of buccaneersus).Along the way Mumble finds soulful love with Gloria (Brittney Murphy), a young lady strong in song and belief in Mumble. Speaking of song, much of the score, while replete with pop standards from the likes of the Beach Boys and Sinatra, adapts several gospel tunes to accentuate the theme of a savior being rejected by his own kind.Happy Feet is a happy film that features cutting-edge CG while it teaches young and old about tolerance and talent.

Her," Cyber romance with hearty humanity.
","'It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.' Albert EinsteinNo better romance is on the screen in 2013 than Spike Jonze's insightful Her. It's about a writer in the future, Theodore, who falls in love with his new operating system (gravelly, sexy voice of Scarlett Johansson), just as he is reluctantly divorcing Catherine (Rooney Mara). The always complicated paths of love make sense as we witness the Platonic relationship develop, sans flesh and sans insanity that usually comes with that flesh.Her is a simple film that offers a view of love I never thought could come from a machine and its software. Although critics will cite the theme as a screed against the distancing of technology and our growing isolation from each other, and they will be right, I offer the sub theme that only when we strip ourselves of sensual bonds can we see the purity of emotional love, an essence of which Plato would have approved. Yes, although technology is mediating our lives at a rapid pace, we fall back to a personal drive to love and be loved that is physical in its best form but understood best if we can distance ourselves from that physicality.This delightfully intimate and non-violent film from acclaimed absurdist director Spike Jonze is more emotionally involving than even Enough Said (one of 2013's best romances) because the interaction between the software and the man is all verbal, no glimpse of the gorgeous Johansson allowed. Although this intuitive OS does allow mind sex, even that activity is abstract, allowing us to realize how connecting with a live human is in the mind still and one of life's great gifts, orgasm or not.Her allows us to witness the evolution of love separate from the encumbrances of physicality. Released from the bonds of appearance, voice is the seducer, not in rude sexual nuance but rather in the care that comes from love of the mind, not the body.K.K. Barrett's production design, Austin Gorg's art direction, and Gene Serdena's set decoration are memorable: full of comfortable light, much glass overlooking the city, and modern but warm furniture both in LA and Singapore. These artists understand that the fusion of technology and art is not a battle but a collaboration that further helps us understand the intricate workings of human emotion.

Slumdog Millionaire," The Best
","'That he should be so abject, base and poor, To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.' Shakespeare's Henry VIIn a time of global fusions, Slumdog Millionaire is a successful blend of thriller and Bollywood hyperbole, a feel-good story of love, fidelity, and brotherhood set in Mumbai's most dangerous and glamorous places. We are alternately thrust into the streets where children are relentlessly exploited and into the sumptuous set of the Indian equivalent of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' Danny Boyle's fabulous story has the Dickensian motif of poverty to riches and the American dream of crossing class lines to triumph with altruism. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) rises from an abysmal childhood running from the worst of adult supervision to become a finalist in a quiz show he hopes his lost friend and love, Latika (Freida Pinto), will be watching, the 20 million rupees prize never his real goal. According to the formula for romantic, uplifting dramas of the poor's struggle for a place in middle class life, no one could mistake what will happen to Jamal on his quest.Indeed, he fulfills Joseph Campbell's monomyth formula, the cyclical pattern for the mythological hero: separation, initiation, return. Although a few attempts at humor seem out of place, Jamal never varies from his serious knightly quest to save the fair maiden.Boyle has wisely and creatively veered from the staid and standard to keep his formula fresh. For instance, he begins in Citizen Kane style at the end, the quiz show, and then ingeniously interweaves questions on the show with how Jamal learned the answers in the course of his life, thereby justifying multiple flashbacks. Also, Boyle, for the few parts of the film that need translation, has placed the subtitles where I have not seen them before, and I appreciate the audience-friendly approach.It is a time for pulling out the genresepic adventure in Australia, scary vampiring in Twilight, and predictable action in Quantum Solace and Transporter 3.

Hacksaw Ridge," A real war story told realistically.
","'I have seen stalks of corn with better physiques.' Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) Director Mel Gibson is an action genius and along with that compliment, let's add he knows his violence. Hacksaw Ridge is a true and heroic story of the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor for bravery in battle. Brave also could be any attempt to separate the film from its controversial director, but I'll let the film speak for itself.The contradiction is real: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a Seventh Day Adventist who not only refused to work on Saturdays, but he also refused even to touch a gun. Through the intervention at a court martial of his improbably brave and conflicted father (Hugo Weaving), Doss is allowed to serve as a medic under those conditions, proving to all that he could be braver saving men at Okinawa's Hacksaw Ridge than anyone else (75 men as a medic with a flair for ingenious rescuing).Although Director Gibson is best known for his graphic depictions of violence in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ, he can also be accused, along with writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, of clichÃ©d story telling. The film's two parts, at home and at war, follow some pretty trite set-ups such as the mountain boy smitten by the nurse, the call to righteous service, the tough drill sergeant ( a terrific Vince Vaughn, see opening quote), and the sentimental trench dialogue.Yet these flaws work when the story needs them to establish Doss's kind heart, courage, and the essential goodness of fellow combatants as they confess they misread him and his conscientious objection. If you can forgive the almost unreal, lush setting for his youth in Lynchburg, Virginia, and his mooning for his future wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), then you will enjoy seeing a real hero in a real war.Yes, Gibson knows how to depict action, not just pain, and it helps make Hacksaw Ridge a welcome addition to war films that tell true stories. And lest I forget, welcome back, Mel; you have been redeemed.",Null,69,130,31 October 2016
The Runaways," Not Girl Scouts
","'You dogs would be lucky to get a gig singing in the shower. Go sell girl scout cookies.' Manager Kim FowleyThe last half of the '70's was a time of growth for me, away from rock 'n roll and toward family and profession. For the Runaways, the first all-girl arena-filling rock band, it was a time of the sex, drugs, and . . . well, you know the cliché already.The Runaways centers not on Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) but the drug-addled lead singer Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning). Although Jett had enough ambition for all five girls, Currie had the bod and the Monroe-like sexiness. Fortunately, after Currie abandons them for a confused notion of home, Jett finally goes it without her and pumps her fist for millions of 'I Love Rock and Roll' in 1882.For a couple of years this band made believers of those hard core rock fans who thought girls didn't belong in the same hall of fame as the Beatles. More sexy than that iconic band but less talented, the Runaways serve as a caution about the heady, amoral world of rock stardom. This film seems more interested in seeing what the band looked like (director Floria Sigismondi has built a career in video) than in the development of character; my case in point is her missing opportunities to mine the Jett persona rather than the Currie anarchy. She does better with the charismatic manager, Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon), whose combination of abuse and love was crucial to their tough style and endurance in a man's world. The training sessions in his trailer are a fine representation of the incubation and the working-class roots of their lives and their genre.I'm feeling once again that I don't want a ride back there in the Hot Tub Time Machine—the scene is scary and dicey. I'd much rather stay home and tap into my Internet connections with news of contemporary bad actors like Jesse James and Britney Spears. Now they would fit even better in Sigismondi's superficial world",Null,4,14,7 April 2010
Donnie Darko," Make sure you see one of the best films of 2001 and one of the most stunning debuts of a director ever.
","You'd think angst in the late 80's was reserved for those who could foresee Wall Street greed transform itself into a monumental crash a little more than a decade later. Then there's Donnie Darko, who could see the end of the world prophesied by a menacing Harvey-like bunny, a sort of guardian devil.The film `Donnie Darko,' directed by first-timer Richard Kelly, depicts teenage disaffection in such a low-key way as to make it almost sweet, largely due to the eponymous hero as played by the sweetly low-key Jake Gyllenhaal. The precipitating crisis of a falling airplane engine seems to crystallize all the danger of the modern world that Donnie accepts ruefully and cynically. This film is funnier and more truthful than last year's excellent `Ghost World.'Although at times Kelly seems to be imitating David Lynch, this is as original a film as `American Beauty,' `Memento,' or `Mulholland Drive' and sometimes just as dense.  Yet there are moments of clarity such as when he tells a gym teacher where to put her timeline or when he exposes the self-help guru (Patrick Swayze) for what he really is.  Donnie is a crusader for the disaffected teens of the world. The key ingredient of the film's success is that Donnie appears to be normal except when he's bullied by a giant rabbit.  Not a totally weird kid, just a slightly rebellious teen who can see the end coming. Make sure you see one of the best films of 2001 and one of the most stunning debuts of a director ever.",Null,1,2,5 February 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Starring the Visuals
","'You may lose faith in us, but never in yourselves.'Optimus PrimeTransformers: Dark of the Moon is not so much about faith as it is things that bump and grind in the day and night—machines to be exact. Michael Bay directs, and he and his buddy, Steven Spielberg, are executive producers, so kids or kid-like fun dominates.It's a CGI smörgåsbord impressive for its volume alone. Almost every frame is full of metal parts that burrow, blow up, or just jabber. Although Bay is clearly having a ball, when he gets down to toppling a big building in venerable Chicago (the echoes of 9/11 are sobering), it's almost serious filmmaking: Awe overtakes humor, which has its own part in summer fluffy fare.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and girlfriend Carly Miller (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley--foxy but no Megan Fox) are primary civilians to stop the Decepticons from conquering the earth. Earthlings are in the process of banishing the Autobots, who have been faithful allies. It's all pretty hazy to me, so I'll stop here with the plot and return to the visual, where Bay puts all his effort.The re-creation of downtown Chicago, with the Wrigley Building taking center stage, is as good as the London of Cars 2. In fact, just seeing street signs such as 'Wacker' gains immediate sympathy from the natives and travelers in the audience. Transformers is another version of special-effects porn at which our American filmmakers are so adept.The effect least impressive for me is 3-D, an ubiquitous bother that is finally on the wane as admission prices rise and consumer enthusiasm wanes. The drain of light, making a dull screen image, can be mitigated if theaters were willing to pay extra for bulbs that burn out quickly. I am left to hope for deliverance from this annoying sideshow except in the case of the documentary Cave of Dreams, in which appreciating 30,000-year old cave paintings is enhanced. Although Bay does an adequate exploitation of the process for romping around the summer screen with thin fare, 2-D is just fine for me, thank you. However, at two and one half hours, he is a magician who keeps the kiddies in their seats. Or maybe it's Huntington-Whiteley substituting for Fox. Anyway, the visuals are the stars.",Null,1,4,29 June 2011
The Social Network," One of the best films of the year.
","It is not Citizen Kane, but David Fincher's Social Network has the energy of young Charles Foster Kane descending with his wunderkinds to take over a newspaper because it 'would be fun.'So too Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), who has become the world's youngest billionaire by inventing Facebook. This biopic chronicles his rise from an undergrad at Harvard, where he and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) begin a campus wide comparison of coeds that led to a global social network phenomenon.Along the way Zuckerberg, not destined to win any congeniality awards, legally fights the upper-crust Winklevoss brothers (Armie Hammer), who claim he took their idea, and Saverin, who didn't fit well as CFO. Whether or not Zuckerberg contributed to Saverin's downfall is an important consideration in establishing Zuckerman's complicated character, who not only comes up with winning programming but also must engage and disengage operatives as brilliant as Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster.The opening sequences where the great ideas take shape on the campus are the most electric and closest to helping us to understand the workings of genius. We learn he's a computer nerd and a workaholic who gets results just as Kane/ Welles did. As in the latter cases, we really don't know who these gifted entrepreneurs really are inside, yet listening to their witty dialogue, more like frat-boy screwball comedy than ordinary repartee, is the film's greatest joy, albeit some of the words are lost in the race.But it sure is fun trying to find out. In the spirit of All the President's Men, The Social Network is necessary viewing for those who want inspiration to start an enterprise and for those who just want an affirmation of the supremacy of ideas and hard work.",Null,4,11,30 September 2010
Macbeth," Don't wait till tomorrow or tomorrow--see superb acting and breathtaking visuals NOW.
","'They say blood will have blood.' MacbethAny production of Shakespeare's Macbeth will ring with that bloody certainty, and contemporary ISIS-like dictatorships confirm that what begins with violence will end with it. Director Justin Kurzei has made a tragedy known by most high school students as real as any battle scene they have seen on YouTube.Visually this Macbeth is dark and smoky outside so that villains like Macbeth (Michael Fassbender) and Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) emerge with hell or at least be comfortable with its worldly manifestations in fear and blood, red and gray. Equally stark are the interiors, dark and minimalist to convey hollow temporary power. Visually the film is a creative take that fully uses cinematographer Adam Arkapaw's considerable talents.As for the bard's language, no one can improve on it, and Kurzei pares enough of it away to keep the essential speeches intact while lamentably to allow the visual to dominate. Fassbender is often in close up speaking quietly but with eerie nuance, such that I have a new appreciation for the character's poetic and tragic nature, a companion appreciation to my two favorite interpretations by Orson Welles and Kenneth Branagh. The way Fassbender slowly moans the iconic Tomorrow speech is as if I had not heard it before. His measured, low volume is just right for the melancholic doom of the sentiment.While I admired Sarah Paulson's wicked Mistress Epps in Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, no facsimile can ever approach the insidious charm of Lady Macbeth. Marion Cotillard plays an effective power broker cum sexual temptress, a powerful combo for such an attractive and talented actress.Notice Lady Macbeth's sexual ministrations while Macbeth gives forth poetically. The irony of these two murderers making love while he rhapsodizes is a rich new take on an ancient Clinton motif, where Hillary could be thought of as a non-violent manipulator and Bill, well, a political and sexual Olympian.Macbeth is a visually stunning work whose elimination of swaths of dialogue to fit the battlefield scenes bothers me a bit. Equally so, placing Lady Macbeth at scenes such as Lady Macduff (Elizabeth Debicki) and her children being burned at the stake takes too much license for creative license.In the end, it's the bard's words that anchor any interpretation:'Life's but a walking shadow. Honor. Love. Friends. But in there's death. Curses.' Macbeth",Null,1,4,11 December 2015
The Great Gatsby," Rich and Rewarding.
","'The most hopeful man I ever knew.' Nick Caraway (Tobey Maguire)I refuse to enter into the fray about the comparison between F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and any film adaptation. Both are different ways of telling the story and should be discussed on their own merits. Baz Luhrmann's film version, The Great Gatsby, is sumptuous, just as you would expect from the visionary director of the eccentric Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet, and it successfully translates the great disparity between hope and despair, the have's and have not's, memory and reality, love and longing, and the American dream. Luhrmann's personal evocation of the roaring 1922 twenties is art deco and sin ramped up to full speed. The mise en scene is loaded with careening cameras, wild colors, flappers, jazz performers, and luscious automobiles. Luhrmann wildly imagines that time between the Great War and the Great Depression when no apparent consideration arose about the poor or the danger of Stock Market catastrophe. The shots are beautiful while the people often foolish.The greatest fool is Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio), newly rich yet old in love, longing for Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), yet her old money will not let him have her, notwithstanding she's married anyway. DiCaprio plays him like he's a movie star (come think of it, Leo is Gatsby in a movie star life), distant and dreamy with tons of money and no one to give it to but revelers who give nothing back. DiCaprio seems instinctively to know the seductions of wealth and fame, and the dark pit of loneliness that accompanies the futile grab for the one thing he can't buy.Carey Mulligan's Daisy makes little impression except for her memorable smile, or at least the actress doesn't show why her character is worth Gatsby's sacrifice. However, that may have been the purpose with her thin characterization all along: She embodies the carelessness of the rich, barely able to sacrifice for love, unattached to anything but things.Luhrmann's choice for Nick's framing the story from the sanitarium compromises his credibility for narrating the story. Although Maguire brings the right wide-eyed naiveté to the role, he doesn't have the weariness of Joseph Cotten's institutionalized narrator, Jed Leland, in Citizen Kane. By the way, that film has a lost dreamer as its protagonist as well.Although Nick knows you can't remake the past, Gatsby keeps hoping to return to it with Daisy. The film gives that melancholy theme its due, and Fitzgerald can be heard and felt at the end:'Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And then one fine morning— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.' Nick",Null,0,6,11 May 2013
Shark Tale," Superficially enjoyable.
","DreamWorks Animation wasn't satisfied with the blindingly successful 'Shrek'; now it has created the almost as entertaining but thematically inferior 'Shark Tale.' It's another anthropomorphic adventure, this time under water with fish voices and faces of movie stars such as Will Smith, Robert De Niro, and Angelina Jolie. While it doesn't have the universal appeal of Pixar's 'Finding Nemo,' it will do swimmingly well. While it doesn't do anything new to the standard animal kingdom metaphors in the way 'Shrek' revised the fairy tale, it is superficially enjoyable.It's a real underworld with De Niro as Don Lino, the Vito Corleone of the sharks, a mafia godfather with a fey son, who, as a 'coming out' vegan, doesn't look like a good candidate to take over from dad. Oscar (Will Smith) is a little fish caught up in his own lies and the machinations of the gangsters. His resolve to do the right thing is frequently neutralized by the sea siren Lola (Who else but Angelina Jolie?) but aided for good by the virtuous Angie (Renee Zellweger). The female fish all resemble Jolie with her bee-stung lips, not necessarily a bad thing; the male fish are spot on caricatures of the actors (See Martin Scorsese's eyebrows).However, what's important here are the ingenious adaptations of fish life from human and the didacticism that usually accompanies these colorful animations. If you want someone to learn an au curant lesson about diversity or honesty, this film will get the point across with humor and grace.Like the 'animals-are-humans' motif, much of the film seem like an homage to old days or tired allusions-- Sir Mix-A-Lot's 'Baby Got Back' has been used too many times before, for example. Although I question whether kids will fully appreciate the parallels to the gangster world or the gay sub-theme, there is enough for the whole family to enjoy. And with a PG-13 rating there is a little sex and violence to keep adults interested.",Null,2,5,29 September 2004
Sully," One of Eastwood's and the year's best.
","'Everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time.' Sully (Tom Hanks)On January 15, 2009, a decidedly un-cinematic hero, Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger of US Airways, landed 155 souls into the Hudson River, safely, as he struggled with a plane crippled by birds in both engines. As we all know, the passengers and crew survived, so what does director Clint Eastwood bring to the big screen that could engage an audience knowing the blessed outcome? First, he brings Tom Hanks, not unknown to portray low-key heroes (see Bridge of Spies and Captain Phillips most recently), whose understated courage seems accurately to reflect the Sully we have come to know and see displayed with the credits. Second, Eastwood crafts one of the most believable crash and rescue scenes I have ever encountered.As in the authentic Hanks interpretation of the quiet Sully, the disaster is compelling and understated. No swelling or morbid music takes away from the terror. Because the simulations at the National Transportation Safety Board hearings were necessary to prove fault, the contrast between the NTSB creations and Eastwood's rendition of the real incident is starkly evocative of the film's attempt to get it all right.Even the NTSB's grilling Sully at the hearings, while it unsettlingly tracks his alleged errors in the 'Miracle on the Hudson,' has a low-profile approach. It confirms Eastwood's and writer Todd Komarnicki's affirmation that everyone in the film is doing his and her job, from pilots, investigators, and rescuers to director and writer.Even Sully's wife, Lorraine (Laura Linney), in the ever-annoying wife-in-waiting-role, is stronger and more balanced than the stock character. Although the passengers are not always first-rate actors, they do seem sincere. However, it is Hanks's film with his stolid, no frills acting, followed by a supportive Aaron Eckhart as his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles.But then, that powerful under-acting is emblematic of the director himself, a lean craftsman who wastes no time in production and has no time for puffery. Although not Unforgiven, Sully is one of Eastwood's best and one of the best films of the year.After seeing this film, you may have a heightened respect even for flight attendants, who evidence a more sincere bravery than summer blockbuster heroes could ever do as that crew directs the passengers: 'Brace. Brace. Brace. Head down, stay down!' If you see Sully in IMAX, your head will be up in the clouds and your heart too.",Null,171,221,6 September 2016
Cinderella Man," An indomitable America coming back.
","'Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep . . .' Hamlet James J. Braddock lived in the Depression Era and fought for his family's life while defeating Max Baer for the heavyweight championship of the world in 1935. Ron Howard directs Russell Crowe in the titular role with an obvious affection for depicting the difficult financial times, the fighter, and the actor. Comparisons to Seabiscuit, both racehorse and film about him, are inevitable and flattering on all sides. Comparisons to 'Rocky' go only as far as boxing and the rise and fall and rise again of thoroughly American heroes. Crowe is far superior to Stallone; Braddock is the real thing, Rocky is a fiction. The authentic boxer is more compelling by the nature of the reality Howard meticulously recreates.I am always intrigued how a director can draw the audience into a drama when most already know the plot. But then Greek dramatists, and Shakespeare with his borrowed plots, have been doing that for centuries. Howard succeeds in making us care about this decent man with a gift, struggling in a time when the best were broken by the stock market crash of 1929. Much of the film chronicles Braddock's string of bad luck, most importantly a broken hand at the peak of his career, and the ambivalence of his wife, who would prefer he not fight anyone, much less the champ, who already killed two men in the ring.In the struggle between husband and wife, I find strains of the Ron Howard missing auteur-ship because of his penchant for the sentimental. Too much time in this overly long biography is taken with the debate over whether or not Braddock should fight; we get the idea early on that no loving wife would want her husband to take a pounding that sometimes actually loosens the brain from the cranium. So Howard should get on with what he does extremely well, depicting the drama of the actual fights in the ring and in the offices of the commissioner, who once suspended Braddock's license for poor fighting and threatens to deny him the chance at world champion Max Baer.That Braddock goes on to lose to Joe Louis is of little consequence for this film, just a footnote after the Baer fight. What is of real interest is that Ron Howard has grown as a filmmaker who can depict character and times in equal measure, Russell Crowe is an actor of enormous subtlety, and James Braddock was a true American hero, a fighter who came back, a symbol of an indomitable America coming back from economic failure.",Null,5,9,29 May 2005
Alien: Covenant," Summer fun with the famous slimy Ridley Scott aliens.
","'One wrong note eventually ruins the entire symphony.' Walter (Michael Fassbender)Anything that happens on or off a space ship traveling for years to an alleged perfect planet is bound, in sci-fi terms, to hold more than one wrong note. Such in the case of Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant, a delectable slice of the Scott Alien franchise and the 2012 Prometheus.It's a ship of clichés but so entertaining you'll rarely notice its own wrong notes.The colony ship with 2000 sleeping souls has its crew awakened by a storm and eventually decides to explore a nearby attractive planet. Like going off alone anywhere in a horror film, this maneuver brings the exact excitement fans have been hoping for, especially the old Alien slimy monsters with the long heads not featured in Prometheus, to the dismay of fans. As Tennessee (Danny Boyle) observes, 'We don't leave Earth to be safe.'The more cerebral tension of Covenant is the twin 'synthetics,' David and Walter, both played by Michael Fassbender. Knowing where their sympathies lie is a key puzzle, enhanced by the affective traits each oddly has, and leading to an uncertain role as good or evil. Fassbender has a poker face just right for concealing allegiances. The twist ending is more enjoyable because of the ambiguities fostered by these two androids.The success for me is all about the humanity reveal and the concomitant dangers droids face when they become more human. Like the Star Trek series, which relies heavily on finding the humanity in the most vicious villains, Alien: Covenant wallows in our imperfections, making us the most vulnerable in the film's experience, especially when it comes to acting like gods, or ancient potentates whose ironic, crumbled monuments Shelley described in Ozymandias : 'Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair.'

The Soloist," Mostly hits the right notes
","Most of us know that The Soloist is a true story about a Julliard dropout, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who plays two strings of a violin on the streets of LA until LA Times reporter Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) writes about him in columns and eventually a book, 'The Soloist: A Lost Dream, and Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music.' And Ayers is no easy subject.But the story is as much about friendship as celebrity, as much about remaining true to your ideals as rising out of poverty, and as much about schizophrenia as pride.The Soloist gives ample opportunity for two actors with serious chops to exercise their gifts more than it gives us any insight into Ayers' illness or Lopez's talent. Although billed second, Downey is the concertmaster.Additionally, it reveals the considerable homeless population of LA as worthy of attention: some 90,000 souls depicted alternately celebrating their companionship and dodging the LA police enforcing a no-stealing-grocery-carts policy. While even this meticulously presented story can only hope to capture the grimness of homeless street homes, Atonement director Joe Wright shows again how adept he can be at filming groups of the suffering unfortunate.As in State of Play, The Soloist makes some reference to the plight of print newspapers, which themselves face homelessness in the wake of the Internet juggernaut. I wish someone would explore this growingly-intense topic more fully because most print writers want to face the printless future armed for survival, and the rest of us who live by morning coffee and newspapers share a kinship with those writers. Because I have now climbed onto my Hyde-Park soapbox, I will offer my advice that the Academy award Robert Downey, Jr. an actual Oscar rather than nominations. As I see his graying head in Soloist, I worry that someday I'll see him receive the Academy's lifetime achievement award without a legitimate statuette. I prefer he be not a soloist but rather a peer of the likes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I have now stepped down from my box. You're welcome.",Null,1,2,27 April 2009
The Martian," One of the best sci-fi's ever.
","'I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.' Mark Watney (Matt Damon)The above quote encapsulates the qualities of The Martian that allow it to be spoken about in the same breath as Arthur C. Clarke's 2001. Not only is Ridley Scott's sci-fi adventure filled with humor and pop cult (wait till you hear Gloria Gaynor's 'I will Survive'), but it also has enough smart but accessible science to please the geekiest fan.In other words, in some respects it trumps the great sci-fi icon by overcoming the cold Hal as a bad-guy computer and creating space as the formidable opponent: 'This is space. It does not cooperate.' (Watney) Gone are Scott's desolate landscapes of decaying cities and dripping monsters-- it's an entertaining and uplifting film that exalts human ingenuity and the need to be humane. Mars is merely a dry, rock and sand stage for mankind to do its scientific and cooperative best stuff. And it serves to remind the world of the necessity to adventure despite the danger: 'Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly.' Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels)That the world is engrossed in the drama of bringing back stranded astronaut Watney from Mars is a testimony to the need for human connection to its great enterprises and the glory of team effort both on the ground (even China gets to play) and in space. Scott's achievement that goes himself one better from Blade Runner and Alien is depicting the inherent drama in people working together for a common goal, ready to make the sacrifices so that mankind can survive.Watney's formula for survival:'You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And if you solve enough problems, you get to come home.'",Null,3,7,22 October 2015
The Fighter," A winner!
","'O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena in perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his opponent.' Walt WhitmanMark Wahlberg has achieved a career high with The Fighter, not so much for his acting, which is eclipsed by a supportive cast that would be hard to beat in the Oscar race, but because he fought for years to bring the story of Lowell, Mass. to the screen. He caught perfectly the blue-collar town's karma and their devotion to the fighting brothers, 'Irish' Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).Director David O. Russell has assembled this cast around the idea that a town in the shadow of Boston can become world famous as its sons become winners in the ring. But then, Stallone did more for Philadelphia as Rocky, so what's the big deal? Like Ben Affleck's excellent thriller this year about Boston in The Town, Fighter captures place and struggle in equal dramatic measure as filmmakers take a close look at the working class's struggles over the last 30 years. While Million Dollar Baby (2004) focused on trainer and fighter and Cinderella Man (2005) gave a microscopic view of a troubled fighter and his small family, The Fighter does all of that with a vigor as exhausting as a bout itself.The Fighter is not just about boxing because as in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980), it's all about people who find in the sport a way to transcend their social prison. In The Fighter, it is more even about family, which weighs heavily on Micky's success or failure. And outside family as well, for girlfriend, bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), is a formidable force in liberating Micky from the suffocating family (his five harpy sisters and domineering manager mother, Melissa Leo, fearsome in her cigarette smoke and driving vision for her sons). Unlike other boxing films, Fighter is patient with Micky's long climb to success, almost painfully long but rewarding in the reality of its prolonged struggle. But it's also the acting that distinguishes it: Christian Bale as Dicky transforms himself again by losing weight and morphing into a manic brother who loves Micky despite Dicky's negative life of drugs and mania; Amy Adams is believable as the gritty but beautiful girl friend; and Melissa Leo plays mom like a lady Macbeth in tight Dockers.Although there will be heavier films competing for 2010's Oscar, I can't think of another whose cast so eloquently has caught the poverty and riches of a town caught in boxing fever.",Null,50,66,27 December 2010
Up in the Air," Slick and modern
","'The slower we move the faster we die. Make no mistake, moving is living. Some animals were meant to carry each other to live symbiotically over a lifetime. Star crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not swans. We are sharks.' Ryan Bingham Up in the Air is a slick, modern American film with drama and humor and a few social issues to make it a nearly perfect holiday present. Jason Reitman has now established himself as one of the brightest young directors if you consider his achievements in Thank You for Smoking and Juno prior to Up in the Air.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney at the top of his game) is a professional terminator, whom corporations hire to do their firing. Along the way, he accumulates ten million frequent-flier miles, a babe or two, and the freedom to be private and happy. However, happy people are prime dramatic targets, and Bingham is no exception. Besides falling for Alex (Vera Farmiga), who is a female version of his non-committal self, Ryan must face the change to electronic dismissals and the dismal job itself of altering for the worse every employee he severs.Current high unemployment and uncomfortable flying circumstances with airlines cutting back on flights and services make substantial topics covered in this film with a depth uncharacteristic of American comedy dramas. The montage sequences of real employees and actors responding to the news that their jobs have been eliminated are powerful reminders that no one is immune in a Great Recession and no one, not even smooth Ryan is actually successful at making anyone feel good about being fired. Such frustrations make Clooney's performance that much more powerful because if someone as gifted as Bingham can't stop the bleeding no one can.The sub theme of virtual firing, created by new college grad Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) makes multiple commentaries on the impersonality of all electronic interfacing and the persistent need to humanize an almost inhuman practice. This theme parallels the impersonality of Bingham's personal life; again a montage of him neatly arranging his items for his roll-on bag drives home both the fascination we can have over someone so organized and free and the distaste for such inhuman efficiency.'Make no mistake your relationships are the heaviest components in your life.'

Atonement," Strange Estrangement
","'Then is there mirth in heaven,/ When earthly things made even/ Atone together.' Shakespeare's As You Like it.It's a comfort to know that a first-rate novelist appreciates the consequences of a lie: Ian McEwan's Atonement, unimpressively adapted for film, is a testimony to the power of Nemesis, who lamely applies comeuppance to the worthy, such as adolescent Briony (Saoirse Ronan), who suffers a major case of remorse after wrongly accusing Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) of raping Lola Quincy (Juno Temple). Briony has a crush on Robbie, and after recognizing the considerable competition of the older Cecelia Tallis (Kiera Knightly), resorts to a lie that sends Robbie to prison and then WWII and the rest of the characters into various stages of suffering.McEwan's allegory, when applied to the machinations of Hitler and ineffectuality of the early allies, is satisfactory for also showing the hope underlying most grand human enterprises. The horrors of WWII as experienced by the condemned Robbie, taking an option to become a foot soldier, are more profound, of course, than the injustice of his spending years in jail. In lengthy tracking through a battlefield that occupies a sagging center of the film, the homely tensions of an uptight Brit family unfortunately give way to director Joe Wright's epic pretensions and thereby lose the drama essential to McEwan's vision of Briony's personal transmogrification and return to humility. Briony, however, lives her own hell as age brings maturity and a growing sense of what she has done wrong to affect the lives of so many by her lies.But she becomes a writer with 21 books to her credit, the final one called Atonement, an autobiography that expiates as it exposes her sin, played by Vanessa Redgrave, perfectly displaying Briony's weary acceptance of her guilt and still strange estrangement from deep feelings. One problem is that she's still a writer who can't restrain herself from writing fiction, which she does with this story as well, allowing McEwan and company to comment on the lies inherent in fiction and autobiography. Necessary lies? Maybe.Although the results might prove otherwise, the truths that emanate from lies may be more worthy than first thought, atonement a blessed state reached with a battlefield of victims more vicious than a carefully carefully-crafted but hollow world war landscape.",Null,0,2,7 December 2007

Add a worthy entrant into that pantheon: comic book genius Alan Moore's futuristic avenger, V, who roams London purging it of criminals common and famous, all of whom suffer his rage at having been abused in a government experiment years ago.V for Vendetta is a superior adaptation, whose major virtue for me is the lack of quick cuts and computer graphics, the exception to the latter being the spectacular destruction of a few London institutions. V's mask has a smile that sears with irony and humanity, plain and simple, and his brand of mayhem has much more to do with brains that technology.Natalie Portman's Evey is an uncomplicated vessel of uncertainty with a strong genetic inclination toward idealism, a perfect companion for the masked vigilante, who has saved her from harm and awakened a woman of substance. Portman headlines the film, finally showing she has the class to act like an intelligent heroine and the beauty to satisfy an audience's penchant for extremes in sci-fi.Much will be made about the allegorical relevance to Bush/Blair conservatism. Andy Wachowski's screenplay and James McTeigue's direction show hooded prisoners who resemble those at Abu Ghraib, and a neo-fascist chancellor intimidating his citizens with fear of fear. Even his second in command has a resemblance to Dick Cheney, and an ultraconservative TV host looks like Silvio Berlusconi.With the entrance of Stephen Rea's chief inspector Finch, I knew this would be a complete cinematic success, for I am always haunted by his world-weary Fergus from Crying Game, an actor whose very hang-dog visage suggests a growing awareness of the world's danger and his inability to stop its eventual destruction. But not before V and his league of masked gentlemen have given the neocons a run for the souls of a dystopia only George Orwell could love and Edgar Allen Poe could depict.'Utopia's quite another land; In her enterprising movements, She is EnglandÂ—with Improvements.'

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," A humorous look at a prominent subculture
","'. . . If we are to become men we need the help of other menwe need our fathers to model for us and then to anoint us, we need our buddies to share the coming-of-age rituals with us and to let us join the team of men . . . .'Frank Pittman I didn't know Talladega Superspeedway is NASCAR Mecca, a race place where devoted fans party and drivers preen, all the time providing snobs like me with redneck stereotypes that play well in late night TV humor. Yet I'm a part of an effete stereotype itself, a hyper-educated egghead with an Accord rather than a Camero and little knowledge of formula car racing.But I'm not detached enough to tell you that Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is a funny film, in part because of the redneck dumbing down (The Dale Earnhardts demand respect; no satire allowed there) and also because Will Ferrell as ace driver Ricky Bobby and John C. Reilly as his buddy, Cal Naughton, Jr., are effective race car drivers with slightly slow wits and big hearts, especially for each other.Ricky's two sons are named Walker and Texas Ranger, he screams 'Help me, Jesus! Help me, Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft to get the fire off me!' after an accident, and his wife is a hot blonde who goes where the earning potential is greatest. This is not brilliant comedic material, but it is a tribute to the actors and their sometimes improvised lines that I frequently laughed out loud as they confirmed my best Jeff Foxworthy insights about rednecks.Besides being a spoof, Nights is also a buddy film with hilarious and tender moments of friendship amid the chaos of track racing groupies and corporate meddling. Similarly, the French and gay bashing portrait of Ricky's accomplished rival is a successful satire of our deepest-held fears about homoeroticism and international disdain for our immaturities. All this satire has been done before, so no kudos for creativity. In fact, the plot of Nights is similar to that of Anchorman, on which both the director and star collaborated.Ricky Bobby's mantra, picked up from his erstwhile dad (Gary Cole), states, 'If you're not first, you're last.' Nights is not the best comedy of the summer, that honor goes to Little Miss Sunshine, but it stands with Clerks II as a humorous look at a prominent subculture whose political clout is approaching the status of 'soccer moms.'",Null,6,30,1 August 2006
