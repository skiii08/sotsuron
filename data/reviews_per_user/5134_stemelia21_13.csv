The Avengers," Start of something awesome.
","This was the start of something marvelous! (That's a really bad joke sorry). It was a good film, excellent cast, good action scenes, pretty much everything you want from a marvel universe movie.I do feel this was the weakest one out of the Four but it was still great to watch. The on scene chemistry between the characters/ actors was good too, I felt this help in the later films. There were some parts which were annoying and didnt quite add up but they were minimal.All in all a good film, 7 / 10 is fair rating. Some of the other marvel films in this timeline are better, so my advice would be to watch all 43 of them.",7,0,1,21 March 2020
Lucky Number Slevin," Interesting, enjoyable and clever film.
","I re-watched this recently and I must say it's quite good. It's got a good cast, its humorous, clever and very interesting. I enjoyed every minute of it. The only thing I would say negative about it is that its quite obvious with some of the characters, most notably the identity of the main character. That aside it was good.I give it 7.5 / 10. It's not quite made it to the category of the standout amazing films but it's just below it in my opinion. Watch it you'll have a good time.",7,0,0,14 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's good watch it.
",I've recently re-watched all of starwars again in preparation for the rise of Skywalker and in my opinion their all good bar the last jedi.Now admittedly none of the newer ones equal the greatness of the original three but they good. Notably the action scenes in episode one are good and I especially like the pod racing scenes. Darth maul was a cool bad guy and the fight between him and obi wan was very pleasing. All in all it was an enjoyable film. People will moan about the story but I think this film was needed to introduce certain characters such as anakin and obi wan.,7,4,6,27 December 2019
Rocketman," It's good.
",I can't say or compare to the truth behind any of Elton John's history but I enjoyed this film. Not really a fan of his either but still it's a good film. I'm quickly beginning to see the talent behind Egerton he's becoming an awesome actor.I give this 7.5 /10. Its definitely worth watching.,7,0,1,30 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It was better than the other two
","This was an enjoyable film and I dont care what people say. It was a bit rushed at times and some of the things they came up with were a bit unexplained and I feel like they should have mentioned them earlier in the trilogy (e.gLeia having trained to fight like a jedi). I found the best way to watch this film is to watch it not thinking to much about the previous two and it becomes quite enjoyable. The story line I actually felt was good, everybody keeps saying it was a to similar to the return of the jedi but I felt that was one of the reasons why it worked for me.Perhaps the most disappointing bit is the knights or Ren they didnt really do much for a formidable group of killers. The other thing that annoyed me was Disney's political crap that they have to put in. Best example was the two lesbian fighter pilots at the end hugging and kissing!? Why was that needed? The fact that they felt that it was needed to be put in is quite worrying. Maybe what they should have been more concerned about was making this trilogy a masterpiece.I give this film an 8/10. It is by far the best one out of the three and well worth a watch. No where near as good as the originals but how many films can you say are? Go watch it and put aside all of these negative reviews and enjoy it for the film in front of you.",8,0,2,25 December 2019
American Pie," 1990s classic.
","American pie was a legendary movie for anybody who was mid to late teens in 1999. They literally hit the nail on the head about how guys of that age think and act, so theres a lot to relate to.I havent really got anything bad to say about this film it's funny and really enjoyable and well worth a watch and probably the best one out of the four with the original cast.... well between this and number 2.I'd rate it at 7.5/10 which I feel is about right. Its not an epic film for so many reasons but at the same time it has so many reasons why it is. If your the right age especially. If you've never watched this it's a must and if your watching again have fun and reminisce.",7,3,3,11 January 2020
Collateral," Decent film.
",The film was quite decent. Character driven without loads of special effects and it was quite nice to see Tom Cruise playing a bad guy for once (bad /good). It was a good idea for a film and it deserves its 7/10 rating. Give it a watch you will enjoy it.,7,3,3,31 December 2019
The Fast and the Furious," Awesome classic!
","This one is by far the best film of the franchise. Filled with countless tuned Japanese import cars, fast car races and chases. Introduced all the main characters that we know and love in the other films.This film came out when I was in high school and started my love for cars. Even today the Toyota Supra 2JZ is the best car ever made in my opinion. Just an awesome film to watch especially if your into cars. Some of the sayings will live forever from this film.7/10 is a fair rating. No where near a 10/10 film but still a personal favourite. Watch it you wont be disappointed. RIP Paul Walker.",7,0,0,13 June 2020
Aladdin," Not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
","Aladdin was a childhood favourite for me and I dont think they did to bad with this as a remake.The casting was good, I even thought Will Smith wasn't too bad as the genie (which I had my doubts about), not really any comparison to Robin Williams in the original. The story was good and they kept to the original for most of the film and even the changes they made fitted nicely, and coincided nicely within today's world of equality. The acting was good and I actually had a laugh watching this and remembering all of the old songs which I loved as a child.I give it 6.5 /10. It's not a record breaking film by any stretch of the imagination and the original will always score higher but I enjoyed it. It's worth a watch.",6,0,0,29 February 2020
The Lion King," It's a quite a good watch but not as good as the original.
","This was pretty much an exact remake of the original but with CGI animals. It was good to watch and I found myself singing along to all of my childhood favourites.The one thing that didnt quite work for me is a couple of th cast choices. Jeremy Irons was such a better scar, in this version he just wasn't evil enough and a bit flat. Same problem with zazu. You'll never beat Rowen Atkinson at being funny and that's what zazu was missing. Other than that it was all good.6/10 is a fair score. It wasn't record breaking or anything but it holds a nostalgic value.",6,0,1,30 March 2020
In Time," Enjoyable film and a neat idea
",I really enjoyed this film. The idea was very intriguing and clever. It wasn't an epic film but it's good. Quite a good actor line up too. I tend to find that Justin Timberlake films are usually quite enjoyable. Amanda seyfried was good too and I think her and Justin made a pleasing on screen duo.I give this a 7/10. Watch it it's good.,7,0,0,22 February 2020
Zombieland," Enjoyable zombie classic
","This is a really fun film. It has a good comedy value too. The storyline is pretty much this..... what would you do in a zombie apocalypse? Get some weapons, find a decent car, kill zombies, smash things up, make a badass friend who is a zombie killing machine and last but not least find a hot woman / man to spend your time with. Awesome haha. Top that with cool zombie killing scenes and throw Bill Murry into the mix somewhere and you have Zombieland.I give this 7/10. It's not an epic film but it's a very enjoyable one and that's what it's all about.",7,0,1,12 January 2020
Joker," Epic!
","This film falls into the same epic category as such films like pulp fiction. Fantastic, epic, thrilling, scary, dark and all without special effects. I really cant emphasise enough how good this film is.I now hold Joaquin Phoenix to be a legendary actor just based off this performance alone. The way the film and the acting made you feel at certain points was amazing, you actually start relating to what it would be like to be in his position. It makes you think about how you yourself would react and believe me, you might be surprised at some of your thoughts. Some of the scenes will make your hairs stand on edge. When a film / acting performance does that, especially with no CGI or effects you know it's good.I give it a 9.5 /10. Absolutely epic film and an instant classic. I would have give it 10 but I dont think it will be everybody's cup of tea. Regardless the best film I've in a long time.",9,3,6,27 January 2020
