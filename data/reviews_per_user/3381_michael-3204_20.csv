The Incredible Hulk," A dull green hue
","The second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a rebooted Hulk that pretends the 2003 version directed by Ang Lee never happened. One of the virtues of this attempt is that it doesn't spend much time on Hulk's origin story, mostly dispensing with it in the opening credits montage. I think this is the filmmakers at least acknowledging that, yes, we all saw this story a few years prior and we really don't need much detail. Another virtue is Tim Roth, whose rat-like Emil Blonsky injects some much needed verve into the proceedings, as does Tim Blake Nelson in the smaller role of Samuel Sterns. The rest of the cast is saddled with playing one note each in one-dimensional roles. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler seem like they would be more convincing as a pair of siblings than as former lovers. Neither are quite as somber or severe as Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were in the same roles, but neither really manage to make Bruce Banner or Betty Ross terribly memorable. (We get a brief shout-out to Bill Bixby in the form of a television clip from 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father,' but that just brought home the sad fact that we haven't had a finer Bruce Banner than Bixby in the 1970's Hulk TV show. Sorry, Mark Ruffalo, thanks for trying.) It seems that most of whatever creative energy was spent here went into rendering a convincing Hulk who can convincingly smash stuff and interact with human characters, and on that score the film succeeds. If only the human characters were more interesting, we might have something here. This isn't the worst film in the MCU (the worst, to date, would come next), but it is the most boring.",5,1,1,30 January 2016
Iron Man 3," MCU Phase II begins well
","Marvel kicks off what it calls 'Phase II' of its cinematic universe by going back to the character with which it launched the whole thing, which is a pretty good idea given Iron Man's primacy in the MCU and Robert Downey, Jr.'s primacy as the best actor it has playing one of its superheroes. It is risky only in the sense that 'Iron Man 2' was a rare misstep for Marvel, one from which it recovers here. Shane Black is a great choice for director and co- writer, and not just because Marvel needed a movie set at Christmas time. This isn't exactly 'Die Hard in the MCU,' but Black's sensibility is a welcome respite from the planet-is-in-peril stakes of 'The Avengers,' which capped off 'Phase I.' His story and direction create enough excitement to make this good fun, give Iron Man a decent opponent, give Tony Stark some demons to wrestle with, and make very good use of the familiar supporting players in Iron Man/Stark's world.Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is almost engaging enough to make me not miss Sam Rockwell, the best feature of 'Iron Man 2.' As Marvel villains go, Killian is nicely developed and reasonably compelling. He's no Loki, but he's big improvement on Mickey Rourke, and like Rockwell's, his evil plan is basically profit-driven. He doesn't want to destroy the planet, he just wants to get rich off the people who do. But his megalomania is nicely juxtaposed with Stark's, who is dealing with PTSD from the events of 'The Avengers.' Stark finally reaches out for help in a way that Killian can't, which makes a resonant dramatic point and also gives both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jon Favreau a lot more to do than they've previously been afforded. Both rise to the occasion, as does Don Cheadle as War Machine. And the film does all this without Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury popping up -- he must still be in mourning for Clark Gregg.I was not as convinced by the sub-plot involving a child and his relationship with Stark. This is an over-long film for what it tries to accomplish, with one or two too many plot twists and turns for its own good. There is no cross set-up here that doesn't turn out to be a double-cross, which never gets confusing but does get wearying. The plot involving the boy Stark befriends seems like the most superfluous in a film that could stand some trimming to be as tight as it should be. Nevertheless, this is a good return to form for Iron Man and a promising way to continue the franchise.",6,0,1,17 October 2016
The Ring," Superb!
","This stunning American adaptation of Japanese novel 'Ringu' bucks the horror movie trends of jump-scares and torture porn in favor of creepy, muted atmospherics and hypnotic psychological chills. Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger move the setting to Seattle and the San Juan Islands, which Verbinski films in gorgeous, washed-out grays and greens occasionally punctuated by sunlight and blood, both of which are used sparingly. The effect is to make the film seem almost black & white, like the videocassette recording that kills you a week after you watch it. Naomi Watts leads a superb cast as the journalist investigating the unexplained death of her niece and perfectly combines both the grit and determination of an intrepid reporter and the growing fear and desperation of a mother trying to protect her child from a malevolent force she can't completely grasp. Happily, the movie doesn't try to wrap everything up in a neat package -- it gives you enough information for its central themes and mysteries to resonate hauntingly, but doesn't try to explain away every last detail.",10,2,2,5 July 2015
Iron Man 2," Dip in quality for the MCU
","For the third entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel went back to the well with a sequel to its first entry, reuniting most of the creative team in front of and behind the camera. Unfortunately, this time it feels like a lot of wheel-spinning and set-up for future issues ... um, movies ... where most of the excitement is generated by promises of things to come rather than anything that is happening here. Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow is introduced and spends much of the film playing a functionary with nothing particularly interesting to do. Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson wanders in with the sole purpose of previewing MCU #4, 'Thor.' At least Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has something going that affects this story and helps with the thematic resonance of fathers and sons. 'Iron Man 2' might will have been subtitled 'The Sins of the Fathers,' with its A-story involving Mickey Rourke's bizarre performance as the son of a man who felt he was wronged by Howard Stark, who himself was no peach of a father to our hero Tony. But the movie is less interested in exploring this than in perfunctory world-building and in repeating beats from the first film, right down to a climactic battle that is a retread of 'Iron Man''s climax. The one saving grace of this film is Sam Rockwell as Tony Stark wannabe Justin Hammer. Rockwell, who was a leading contender for Tony Stark before Marvel settled on Robert Downey, Jr., shows what he could have done with the role. It's not that Rockwell would have been better than Downey's by now iconic personification, but it's fun to see a variation on Stark's snarky, egocentric megalomania that can hold his own with the master. And fun is something this film could have used a lot more of.",4,1,2,19 March 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," Disaster epic is an epic disaster
","Possibly the worst -- certainly the dumbest -- big-budget Hollywood disaster epic ever made, 'The Day After Tomorrow' offers a nonsensical CGI-filled escalation of climate change effects that happen over the course of a few days rather than a few centuries. But don't worry, because we're assured in the end credits that the film is 'carbon neutral.' This is quite a comedown in quality and entertainment value from director, story author and co-author of the screenplay Roland Emmerich, whose 'Independence Day' was a fine example of this kind of film done right. Its only notable achievement is not one but two career-worst performances from two successful American actors -- Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. Quaid (whose brother Randy had better luck with Emmerich in 'Independence Day') plays up the full melodrama inherent in the overwrought script and loads every pregnant pause, concerned reaction, and Cassandra-like warning declamation (he has several) with actorly pomposity. Because the material just isn't there, he looks ridiculous. Gyllenhaal, on the other hand, is mostly checked out -- his scenes are an effective sleep aid. I hope he stayed alert enough to cash his check.",1,1,7,4 August 2016
Alien," Original and best
","I first saw 'Alien' the day after it opened, knowing very little about it except that the cryptic TV commercial for the film looked cool and its advertising slogan ('In space, no one can hear you scream') was compelling. Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott were mostly unknown and the rest of cast, while recognizable, weren't typically headliners in highly anticipated Hollywood releases. This had 'B-movie' written all over it, and in many ways it is very much a B-movie made with A-list skill, craftsmanship and imagination.It's impossible, all these years and several viewings later, to separate myself from my first experience of watching it. I can't forget that I nearly jumped back a row, to the accompanying screams of a nearly full theatre of moviegoers, during the now-famous chest- bursting scene. The iconic imagery of the film -- the sensuous design of the alien ship, the ominously large corpse of the alien spaceman fused to his giant perch with bones bent outward, the unknowable originality of the titular creature and its unpredictable life cycle, the lived-in character of the commercial towing vessel Nostromo ('Star Wars' excepted, in most depictions of space travel at the time everything had a factory-fresh gleam) -- all became almost instantly iconic and influential for a reason. Having experienced this film's introduction into an unsuspecting world, it's not possible to look at it through the eyes of contemporary film fans who come to it later and might judge it by a different standard.All of which it to say, I admit to being incredibly biased in my assessment of how well 'Alien' holds up despite the considerable advances in visual effects since it was made. What looks a bit dated today is the depiction of the on-board computer 'Mother' and the bizarre blinky-light room in which it is housed. Most of the rest of the tech depictions are fine, mainly because the story doesn't rely on whiz-bang futuristic tech to propel it. The basic (and, alas, inadequate) weaponry with which Nostromo's crew tries to contain the alien was understandable then and now, on a non-military vessel with a civilian crew. The surprise reveal about the true nature of one of the crew members still makes sense against the backdrop of corporate shenanigans in which the crew operates. Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's story carefully constructs the sense in which the deck is stacked against our heroes in ways they don't fully grasp until a few of them have died, and it does so mainly by making the crew anything but heroic. These are ordinary workers who snipe at each other and complain about their pay and try to advance their place in the hierarchy the way workers everywhere do, and maintain an uneasy camaraderie and mutual respect despite workplace tensions that are eminently relatable.A lot has been written about this film as a metaphor for both male and female rape and the predatory nature of sexuality. While the film's design is stuffed with incredible sexual imagery, I'm not really sure what that analysis gets you. 'Alien' is essentially a very effective, beautifully shot horror movie set in outer space. It employed and helped solidify horror movie tropes we're all familiar with. It's not afraid to take its time to build atmosphere, character and suspense, which might (but shouldn't) try the patience of people used to the faster pace of current films. To me, it was and remains an almost perfect movie.",10,2,3,11 July 2016
Interstellar," Satisfying, but could have been brilliant
","There is a truly brilliant movie buried within the ponderousness and self-importance that weighs down 'Interstellar.' Director and co- writer Christopher Nolan has never disappointed with regard to stunning visuals and design -- give this guy a big budget, and he puts it all on screen in spectacular fashion. Unfortunately, he doesn't have as sure a hand with regard to audio quality. Whatever audio effects (or affectations) he goes for, not for the first time in a Nolan film, render some of the dialogue unintelligible. Given some the of more hackneyed and overwrought dialogue that is intelligible, maybe that's for the best. I wouldn't suggest watching 'Interstellar' with the sound turned down because the parts with dialogue that drag would be interminable -- plus, we'd miss Hans Zimmer's terrific score -- but the first 30 minutes or so might be improved by the sound of silence.For one thing, Matthew McConaughey's irritating, overly emotive, actorly performance is most painful in the film's early scenes. He gets better and less annoying as the film progresses, partly because the screenplay stops burdening his character ('Coop,' for Cooper -- ugh) with carrying the burden of mankind's horrible mistakes in his drawling delivery. For the record, I don't dislike McConaughey as an actor generally -- he's done some fine work along with some inconsequential drivel -- but he chose here to embrace Coop's dourness and disappointment in a way that helps throw the film off- balance, while his down-home supposed lack of pretension just gets tiresome. I have little doubt that he delivered exactly what Nolan wanted, and what Nolan wanted is the real problem.The rest of the cast fairs much better, though I do wonder how sick Michael Caine must have become at the mention of Dylan Thomas's name. There is a bit of what might be considered stunt casting involving a major Hollywood star who shows up for a pivotal development in our heroes' search for a habitable planet, but far from being distracting or beside-the-point, it helps make for the film's tensest, most gripping and emotionally resonant scenes. While there are other set-pieces that almost get to that level, the odd pacing and sheer weightiness of a film that takes gravity as its main topic ultimately makes this a frustrating watch, if only because it's so beautiful and has so many jumbled ideas that it's easy to imagine it being so much better than it is.",6,1,3,3 October 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good movie about a good man
","I could not have been less interested in a film about Captain America before seeing this, which I did only because I remain interested in Marvel's project of building its own cinematic universe and did not want to skip film #5. As it turned out, this is the first in the MCU seamlessly to tie the disparate elements together and to provide some context for ongoing and upcoming tensions and conflicts. It also delivers a rollicking good time and is easily the best film in the MCU since 'Iron Man.'As embodied (perfectly, including his actual body) by Chris Evans, Steve Rogers/Cap is neither the jingoistic super-soldier nor the ironic refutation of one that he might have been; he is, as Stanley Tucci's Dr. Erskine puts it, simply a good man. The story and screenplay do a great job of emphasizing the core values of what we, in the 21st Century, would want in an All-American hero (including, alas, the fact that he is still white, which might change someday) while also exploring the more cynical or less appealing uses to which others would put that hero. Director Joe Johnston's visual style deliberately recalls wartime propaganda films from both sides of the WWII, including the masterpieces of Leni Riefenstahl. Cap's chaste, tragic romance with Bucky ... um, Peggy Carter (beautifully played by not-so-secret weapon Haley Atwell) adds the right amount of pathos and reinforces the period sensibilities without overwhelming or distracting from the main story. If there's a weakness here, it's one common to Marvel films: the villain, Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), is too cartoonishly evil to take seriously as a threat. Weaving has a grand old time playing up Red Skull's megalomania, but as written the character lacks the cunning and cleverness that made Tom Hiddleston's Loki so formidable in 'Thor,' the only film in the MCU so far to have a worthy villain. It might have been more interesting to spend more time with Hydra -- the film only hints at the threat Hydra poses to the established world order. Of course, there will be time for that in future movies and TV shows, but if these are the origin stories of both an important hero and a fiendish threat, the film ultimately delivers the first in spades and doesn't quite manage the second as effectively as it could have.",7,0,0,23 April 2016
Independence Day," Sets a high bar for disaster spectacles
","If you're looking to poke 'Independence Day', it gives you plenty of ammunition, including an abundance of clunky dialogue, some cornball characterizations (and a few actors who crank up the corn to 11 -- namely Harry Connick Jr. and Randy Quaid), occasional poor CG, boring creature design, and a miraculous magical plot contrivance that is supposed to save the day for us humans. I think all of that is compensated for by the giddy, go-for-broke exuberance with which the movie amps up the scale of destruction, even while keeping the story tightly focused on a handful of nicely played characters who the story brings together smoothly and effectively. Amidst the dialogue groaners and the fake-looking fireballs, it's easy to miss all the big and small things the movie does right -- especially, of course, laying waste to New York, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. in a thrilling cross-cut sequence. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum play off each other better than I would have expected and they are supported by an able cast who create a credible ensemble, one member of which actually dies (something disaster movies seem to have forgotten how to do of late). Though the creature design was pedestrian even at the time, the set design of the alien ships remains imaginative and visually compelling. All in all, this film is a blast.",8,0,0,6 July 2015
Jurassic World," Slick and soulless
","The most remarkable accomplishment of 'Jurassic World' is demonstrating that it is possible for Chris Pratt to be a boring screen presence. Its most remarkable aspect, in general, is illustrating how challenging these franchise reboots can be. We have had a number of decent-to-excellent reboots in recent years -- here's a healthy reminder of how leaden they can be when things go wrong.There are a few good ideas buried in the film, especially the soft critique of corporate hegemony and its brand-everything mindset. It tries to have its cake and eat it too by incorporating the significant amount of product placement into this critique, thus attempting to make a virtue of necessity while it cashes the checks. This might have had more resonance if the film wasn't so soulless. The design of the world -- no longer just a park -- is a nicely conceived update of the original that allows for both visually stylish enhancements, like all the holographic projections, and plenty of visual callbacks to the original. Unfortunately, the latter just serve as several well- placed reminders of how much better 'Jurassic Park' was. Jack Johnson's character, a coordinator in the central control room whose name I've already forgotten because he's so uninteresting, wears a t-shirt from the original park he bought on e-Bay and says how much he respects its legitimacy. This is another example of the film trying to insulate itself from obvious critiques. As with the product placement scheme, it doesn't really work as well as the filmmakers seem to think it does.One of the worst aspects of 'Jurassic World' is that it takes the least appealing parts of 'Jurassic Park' and runs with them, especially the sentimentalizing and anthropomorphizing of the dinosaurs. 'Park' was guilty of this too, at least compared to the harder-edged, more clear-eyed novel by Michael Crichton from which it was adapted, but only around the edges and only in service of broadening the film's appeal in an all-ages direction. 'World' goes whole hog in this direction, despite regular monologues and commentary from Pratt's Owen Grady, who is supposedly training raptors, that these are animals and should be respected as animals - - commentary the film repeatedly undercuts by depicting the dinosaurs as military strategists. The lack of faith the film has in its own 'assets,' as Bryce Dallas Howard's corporate functionary who runs the park keeps calling the creatures, is the most depressing and cynical aspect of this whole enterprise, and left me wondering why I went to see a movie that trades on the wonder of dinosaurs while refusing to believe that actual dinosaurs would be wonderful.",4,5,6,23 September 2016
A Bug's Life," A step down from 'Toy Story'
","Not a bad movie by any means, but it's hard not to be disappointed by the degree to which Pixar's second feature falls short of the very high standard it set with its first, 'Toy Story.' Visually, 'A Bug's Life' is almost as impressive and should be applauded for a completely different setting -- writers/directors Lasseter and Stanton certainly can't be accused of simply repeating themselves.Unfortunately, the characterizations here aren't nearly as rich and entertaining and the casting not as inspired. Phyllis Diller could almost make a good substitute for the function Don Rickles served in 'Toy Story,' but she's not given enough to do and never really gets to cut loose. Kevin Spacey is always a good villain and adds some spice to the proceedings as Hopper, but the notion of making grasshoppers into a biker gang -- which should have worked well -- is half-heartedly executed. The rest of the cast, particularly Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, aren't especially interesting or memorable. After a slow start, the film definitely picks up with the introduction of the circus, performers of which provide most of the comic relief, but the only standout is Heimlich the caterpillar who can't wait to get his wings.Overall, the story is a bit too convoluted to convey the simple, powerful messages about conformity and perseverance the film wants to deliver as cleanly as it might with a tighter story structure. This is probably a film children will still enjoy, but unlike 'Toy Story,' there isn't as much here for people who've passed through puberty.",5,1,2,2 August 2016
Toy Story," A resounding success
","Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is 'The Island of Dr. Moreau' rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong.",9,0,1,17 February 2016
Mission: Impossible," Rebooting done right
","This fast-paced thrill ride is a master-class in how to revive, extend and enhance a fondly remembered (if slightly cheesy) property that, in lesser hands, might have seemed time worn. Director Brian De Palma evokes espionage classics like 'The Third Man' to lend some -- but not too much -- flair to a twisty narrative full of double- crosses that the story and screenplay writers manage to render coherently. It has aged unusually well for a story that relies so heavily on what was supposed to be cutting-edge technology in the mid-1990s, with only the rendering of Internet communications looking silly (that email address!). The concluding action set- piece, which was one of the first to depict the newly opened 'Chunnel,' strains credulity still, as it did at the time, but packs a punch nevertheless. The cast is at least serviceable -- Tom Cruise and Vanessa Redgrave really sparkle in their scenes together, Emmanuelle Béart is flat, and everyone else does what they need to do to maintain the story's tension. Danny Elfman's score, thank goodness, makes extensive use of one of the greatest themes in TV history.",9,2,2,2 May 2016
Thor," A step up for the MCU
","It would have been easy for the fourth entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to collapse in a heap of silliness: the elaborate costumes; the extravagant playland that is Asgard (which somewhat resembles the Emerald City); the complicated retelling of Norse mythology. You need actors with the weight and seriousness of Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba just to bring off the headgear. But this film has everything it needs to hold itself up and extra to boot. Rene Russo, for example, doesn't have nearly enough to do as Thor's mother. Director Kenneth Branagh and his small army of screenplay and story writers structure this as a basic hero's journey, mining culture and legend for little tropes that fit nicely. Thor's gang-of-five recall Robin Hood's Merry Men, except that here one is Jamie Alexander as the fiercely capable Lady Sith. Resonances with some of Shakespeare's history plays are interwoven without being too pointed. Unlike with Marvel's previous two entries, here the characters who remind everyone that 'The Avengers' is coming aren't distractingly shoehorned in. Mostly, no one forgets to have fun with all this, especially not Chris Hemsworth in the deceptively simple title role. Not only does he look every bit the Man-God he's supposed to be, he hits all the emotional marks the story throws his way with the right mix of humor, arrogance and sincerity, and plays well off the other actors. The film's secret weapon is Tom Hiddleston's Loki, easily Marvel's best villain to date, who connives and deceives with the wit and aplomb you'd expect from a legendary trickster. Hiddleston manages the complicated feat of making Loki both fun to watch and someone to be wary of because of his unpredictability. 'Thor' doesn't quite reach 'Iron Man''s heights, but it is a good return to form after two lackluster MCU entries.",6,0,1,5 February 2016
Iron Man," Welcome to the MCU!
","After years of licensing out its marquee characters to film studios to stave off bankruptcy, Marvel finally launched its own production house to build its own cinematic universe. With Spiderman and the X- Men off their table, they gambled by turning to b-list Avenger Iron Man to kick things off, and it paid off handsomely. Because numerous prior attempts at bringing Iron Man to the big screen had failed, they have a wide-open canvas on which to world-build. The story and screenplay are open-ended enough so as not to close off possibilities prematurely, yet not so generic as to rob it of its own life. The character of Tony Stark fits Robert Downey Jr. like a glove; he fully captures Stark's obsessiveness and bemused arrogance. Most of the other actors in Stark's world seem to calibrate themselves off Downey, with Gwyneth Paltrow, Jon Favreau (who also directed) and Terrence Howard doing a good job conveying a sense of how exhilarating and exhausting it is to be in his orbit. The villain of the piece isn't technically revealed until well into the running time, but only people who've never seen a comic book won't have guessed (if only from the character's improbably evil name) the identity. This isn't a flaw -- the film doesn't have anything riding on trying to trick or misdirect viewers, but the story is structured in a way that we get explicit information only as Stark discovers it, which is an effective technique for putting us in his camp. The action sequences are everything we could hope for from a multi-million dollar tent-pole film, well-designed and executed and well-integrated into the story. I had trouble with the idea that someone supposedly as brilliant and worldly as Stark would be so naive about the geopolitical realities involved in arms dealing -- this is the source of contradictions in Stark's character with which the film tries to grapple but never successfully comes to grips. Still, it's an exciting beginning to a multi-film narrative the likes of which no enterprise has attempted in a long time.",8,0,1,16 December 2015
Thor: The Dark World," Cracks in the MCU
","The strain of intense serialization takes a toll on 'Thor: The Dark World,' the eighth film in Marvel's on-going cinematic universe. Natalie Portman is back as Thor's earthly romantic interest, Jane Foster, which necessitates a slightly awkward part-explanation, part-avoidance of why Thor seemed to forget she existed during the events depicted in 'The Avengers,' in which Jane did not appear. Coming up with a compelling story that is about 70% a continuation of 'Thor' and 30% a continuation of 'The Avengers' and fits into the larger, on-going MCU story line that is supposed to culminate somewhere down the road paved with Infinity Stones is a tall order, and the multiple writers don't quite pull it off. Neither, however, do they completely fumble, and Alan Taylor's serviceable direction as well as a solid cast most of whom we're familiar with do a good job of smoothing over the rough spots as much as possible. The cast is really the best feature -- Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are by now so comfortable with each other that it is easier that ever to believe these two were raised as brothers, it's good to see Portman again and Kat Dennings as Jane's sister is more of an asset to the story (and slightly less annoying) than she was in 'Thor,' Rene Russo as Thor's mother gets more to do, and there are a few pleasant if minor additions to the human side of the story, including Jonathan Howard and Chris O'Dowd.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't spend as much time exploiting these strengths as it does on yet more universe-threatening, lazily conceived super-villains, the Dark Elves, and on fake science and fake legend about astronomical convergence. 'Iron Man 3,' the first film in the MCU to follow 'The Avengers' and the one immediately preceding this, played it smart and didn't pretend the universe was at stake, for the obvious reason that such monumental stakes would call for the involvement of all Avengers. This film is not so smart. Despite the high stakes, the film really doesn't go very far afield. After the globe-trotting qualities of the most of the MCU, this one feels studio-bound and more reliant than ever on computers to create any sense of scale.The fun thing about Thor as originally conceived was the supposition that what most people regard as Norse mythology was, in fact, based on powerful aliens whom the primitive humans would have perceived as gods. The first film got that; this film, rather than explore that motif in more depth or even play with it, opts instead for mumbo- jumbo about gravitational anomalies that helped ancient peoples build temples and what-not. It's meaningless drivel and a little insulting, both to ancient civilizations and audiences' intelligence. I'm all for suspending disbelief, but give us something worth suspending it for, not a grammar-school rehash of 'Chariots of the Gods.'This is still better than 'Iron Man 2' and not really appreciably worse than 'The Incredible Hulk,' which was more coherent but duller. It is, however, the first in the series that makes me wonder whether Marvel can really pull off its ambitious enterprise as consistently as it hopes.",5,0,0,14 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Imitation of life and film
","'The Force Awakens' meets the burden of rebooting one of the most successful and beloved franchises in film history by largely playing it safe and copying the principle beats of the original. This approach is considerably more satisfying and considerably less daring than the approach George Lucas took with episodes 1-3, which tried to fill in the universe's back story with a lot of dramatically inert detail no one really cared about. Director J. J. Abrams and his vast army of helpers can be forgiven, and perhaps applauded, for going back to basics and giving the people what they want -- a rollicking good story that reminds us why we liked 'Star Wars' in the first place -- even if that means sacrificing the element of surprise.The filmmakers definitely should be applauded for bringing some much needed diversity to the Star Wars universe and casting actors good enough to make these choices feel natural and not shoehorned in. The new additions hold their own against the considerable joy at getting to spend more time with Han Solo and General (nee Princess) Leia. The overall look is nicely executed, inspired as it is by the original with the benefit of a lot more money to spend.Still, it lacks the sense of wonder and excitement that the original generated. 'Star Wars' managed to pull viewers into what seemed like an on-going story by emphasizing the original in a context that was deliberately familiar. 'The Force Awakens' mostly drops the originality. Once you figure out where it's going, which doesn't take very long, the pleasure is in watching it play out, which it does well enough to be entertaining, exactly like you know it is going to.",6,5,14,13 July 2016
Godzilla," A worthy update
","There is a lot to criticize about the most recent reboot of one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history. The basic premise concerning ancient giant creatures that feed on radiation is preposterous, the human characters are thin and behave in ways that don't make sense, the coincidences the story asks us to swallow are almost as big as the title creature, and the tonality of the performances is all over the map. Bryan Cranston cranks himself to 11 (his scenes with a natural talent like Juliette Binoche demonstrate how outclassed he is as an actor), Ken Watanable spends a lot of time staring wistfully and forlornly into space, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems set on sucking the life out of any scene he's in. Even the score by the usually reliable Alexander Desplat is forgettable. Yet despite all the flaws, this film has one awesome quiver in its bow and it knows how to use it, making it eminently watchable and entertaining. This is a super-sized Godzilla largely indifferent to humans and humanity, and as such is perfect update to the anxieties explored and exploited in the Toho original. In place of fears about unleashing the destructive power of the atom, now we quiver in the shadow of natural forces we monkey with but don't completely understand, forces capable of wiping us out while barely noticing us. Director Gareth Edwards and his army of visual effects and sound design gurus make sure that Godzilla lives up to his name and legacy. Yes, it could be a better film if the humans had more depth and the story wasn't so contrived, but it wouldn't be worth anything if that thrilling roar wasn't so convincing, the blast of hot breath so exciting, and the earth-shaking power not so awesome. The film delivers in a big way on the one character that really matters.",7,0,2,16 January 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," Interview with Wellington Vampires
","There are a lot of targets in this amusing meta-mockumentary about of group of vampires trying to make it in modern Wellington: vampire myths and movies, documentaries and other mockumentaries. Writers/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi wisely keep the focus tight and mine the mundane (a vampire chore wheel, the tensions of sharing a flat with others) for humor as much as they explore the more absurd elements of the premise, like how to get into a nightclub when you have to be invited in, tricky relationship management with familiars, and run-ins with a rival gang of werewolves. If the best mockumentaries explore the social, cultural and political milieu of its subjects, this one has to make those things up out of pop culture depictions, so it isn't always as sharp and wickedly funny as the great examples of the genre. It is, however, very well-constructed, thoughtful and mostly funny, even with a few dry stretches. And it's nice to see New Zealand as something other than Middle Earth for a change.",6,4,7,23 January 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," The proverbial cabin, dissected
","This film sat on the shelf for a few years due to studio bankruptcy, but like some fine wines, it improved with age. For one thing, the stars of Chris Hemsworth and Jesse Williams rose in the interim, which is a bit ironic given that they are the weakest members of the excellent cast. They aren't bad, but they sometimes struggle with the subtleties of timing co-writer Joss Whedon's dialogue usually require of performers, while the rest of the cast -- especially Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, along with Whedon veterans Amy Acker and Fran Kranz -- are more natural, relaxed and effective in their roles.For another, the combined critique of and homage to horror entertainment seems to get more relevant, rather than to date, as the years pass. Director/co-writer Drew Goddard has a fine eye for paying visual tribute to contemporary and historic classics of the genre and his script is peppered with lines taken from those classics. Sometimes, the latter effort is a bit clunky, though the former never is. Horror movie and TV fans can have plenty of fun just playing spot-the-references, and there are videos on You Tube that will help viewers out with that.But the film is so much more than a series of references. Like Wes Craven's 'Scream,' 'The Cabin in the Woods' is a deconstruction of horror tropes and motifs, except that this time, the audience is ahead of the characters in terms of figuring out what's really happening. 'Cabin' sets up a scenario in which it can offer intriguing and clever explanations for why characters in horror films do and say the dumb things they sometimes do and say, and in doing so makes a case that audiences need to demand better. These explanations aren't always explored in enough detail to be entirely convincing, clear or persuasive, but they generally get the job done. As long as you don't pull too hard on particular threads, the whole elaborate construction isn't likely to unravel. What is more clearly and consistently explained is why this particular assortment of character types is something we see repeatedly, with minor variations, across decades of horror films.In the end, 'The Cabin in the Woods' makes an argument that we need to blow up the horror genre and start again, yet it does so in a way that appreciates and emulates what makes a good horror movie so compelling to begin with. It's a tricky thing to do because the film itself, by weaving a magnificently entertaining and reverential example of horror at its finest, seems to undercut its own message. Somehow, it succeeds beautifully, in no small part by being a film that gives you a lot to chew on, but is clever and creative and fun enough to enjoy purely on its terrific surface.",9,1,4,19 September 2016
