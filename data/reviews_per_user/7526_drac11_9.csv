The Ring," Don't answer the phone!!!!!!
",Do you like freaky movies then this would be the one for you. This movie had mysterious parts in it and also frightening to the bone parts. I would rate this movie 7 out of 10 because I kind of really didn't understand it. My favorite person in the movie was Noa or whoever he was. This movie made me keep on watch by how things would go in the movie. Out of the strangest movies I have ever seen this would be one of them. And that gets to a lot of freaky movies. What I liked about it is that in the first part when the girl is researching she finds out that all of the kids that watched it at the same time died at the same time. This movie had real good affects. So if you want to watch this mysterious film rent it or buy it to see the freak show. Remember don't answer the phone but if you do you have 7 days.,Null,0,0,8 March 2004
Underworld," Total action!!!!!!!!!!
","This movie is so awesome. I would recommend anybody to watch Underworld. And what more can you ask for it's a battle between realms. Vampires and Werewolves. A good selection if you ask me! And just to say I was cheering for the vampires. I would rate this movie 9 out of 10. The visual effects were great and there was a storyline in this Horror / Action movie. Many time movies like this have no storyline or it is so weak that it gets lost in the action. The acting was good as well. I don't think that this movie could get any better, but I still thing that Dracula 2000 was the best movie ever made. I really enjoyed watching this movie. If you want to watch this movie rent it or buy it.",Null,0,0,4 March 2004
Blade," It was a good movie.
",If you have seen all of the vampire movies then you should see this one because out of all the vampire movies this one is not like them this one has a twist and doesn't go with the same flow. I would rate this movie 7 out of 10 because of some reasons why people die in it. I would recommend seeing this movie if you are a vampire fan.,Null,0,1,23 February 2004
The Thing," Absorb and take over the movie!
","This movie was as freaky as ****. If you know what pure horror is than you know what this movie is. I like the thing because it's strange, mysterious, bloody, and also terrific. When I saw this movie at first I was like awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you like horror movies than you would like this strange movie. I would rate it 6 or 7 out of 10.I think the visual affects in the thing were real good for an older movie. My favorite actor in the movie was Kurt Russle because he plays a tough person in it. I bet you that you wouldn't go to bed after you saw this. So go watch it and see how good the movie really is. And sleep tight don't let the creatures bite!",Null,0,1,24 February 2004
BASEketball," Funniest movie ever
","This movie is so freaking hilarious. I would definitely rate this a 10 because of its funny scenes, great actors, and i've got to admit hot actresses. I can see why this movie is so funny, it's because the makers of this movie are the creators of south park a comedy central classic. But in this movie have some real sick scenes and everybody should agree with me. The movie Baseketball is one of those movies where you just have to watch it over and over again and the scenes are just so funny that you have to keep on watching them over and over. I think this movie should not be recommended for children that are under 13.Overall Basketball is a funny movie that you can't just watch once, it's addicting to watch.",10,0,3,23 March 2005
School of Rock," What an awesome movie!!!!!!!
","The school of rock movie is so good. I would rate it at least 9 out of 10. It had a lot of popular songs and bands like AC/DC and many more. My favorite people in it were Freddy and Zack but nobody can forget Jack Black. This movie was a mixture of comedy, action, and adventure in a way. They choose the right people to play in this movie. And they also made up some real good songs in it. What I liked about the end is that they made is you want to watch the ending because they are still in the movie but it's the end credits. So if you want to watch this movie rent it or buy it before it's all sold out. But let me tell you I got it before it was all sold out and it was worth it.",Null,0,0,6 March 2004
Signs," A good slow and mysterious film!!!!!!
",This movie was real good it had a lot of action in it. I would rate Signs 8 out of 10. This movie made me want to keep on watching this freaky film. I liked this movie because of the aliens in it and I liked the aliens because you never knew what they looked liked and how they acted. This movie had real good affects over all it was a good movie. My favorite people in the movie Signs was Gram and Uncle Merill. The movie was slow but was mysterious like I said before. Once I watch this I didn't want to stop watch it and the same thing with Dracula 2000. but Dracula 2000 was my favorite movie ever. So if you want to watch this slow but mysterious film rent it or buy it. Be sure to tell me if you liked it not.,Null,0,1,7 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," BOOM!!!!!!!! Awesome.
","The movie return of the king (lord of the rings) was awesome the visual affects were totally cool. I think that this was the best lord of the rings movie! If you know what action is you know what this movie is. I would rate it 9 out of 10 and I mean it. I would recommend this movie to people who like big action parts in it. But it's the last lord of the rings movie there is. So if you like big action movies you would like this 1. It's the last jorney for Frodo, and the others but the best. I loved this movie because it had alot of blood in it but lots of action as I said before. Watch this movie and you will see how good it is. But I can give to much off so go and see it.",Null,0,1,24 February 2004

","If you like to watch good and funny movies then watch this one a night at the roxberry it's a real good movie trust me you want to know why well then I'll tell you because it's funny, it has some sad parts in it and it has parts in it when you just have to laugh so hard that it's stupid. I would rate this movie 7 out of 10 because of some of the parts are just stupid as I said before. My favorite actor in this movie would be Chris Catten who plays in Undercover Brother which is a kind of good movie, my favorite actress in this movie would be the girl plays as Candy in a night at the roxberry who plays in i don't know but she played good in this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes real funny movies.",Null,22,27,12 June 2004
