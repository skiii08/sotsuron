The New World," To those who don't buy the Malick-as-reclusive-genius patter...
","See The New World anyway. To establish my low place on the Malick-worshipping spectrum, I thought Badlands was serviceable, that Days of Heaven went for Old Testament and settled for coffee-table book, and that The Thin Red Line was feebly improvised on set by someone who didn't seem to have the character, style, depth or experience to shoot good footage on the fly and so constantly resorted to uninspiring nature shots to cover up for the fact that the actors had no clue what they were doing ( although I did appreciate the magic trick of making Adrien Brody disappear. ) So as you can see, I wasn't exactly about to hoist Malick up to the Rivette-Kubrick-Cassavetes level.As it turns out, there are more cutaway nature shots than in Days of Heaven and Thin Red Line combined, Malick is still riding his Paradise Lost hobbyhorse, the classical music samples are as cheesily tasteful as ever, and all around, this is just like his other movies, or the difference is so small as to be infinitesimal -- AND it stars Colin 'Will Arch His Eyebrows For Food' Farrell, maybe the only actor on earth more annoying and vain than Adrien Brody, a man who seems to destroy historical epics the way the locusts in Days of Heaven destroyed Malick's exasperating wheat.... Yet despite this morass of handicaps no movie should be able to recover from, The New World left me in a state of absolute rapture ( like so many other movies in this fiscally but not artistically cursed year, including the Brody-starring King Kong. ) Why? I can't quite figure it out. Malick's brand of National Geographic tone poem should be more pallid and generic than ever considering so many amazing latter-day examples of cinematic impressionism like Hou Hsiao-Hsien's Flowers of Shanghai, Michael Winterbottom's Code 46, Arnaud Desplechin's Esther Kahn, Xu Wei's Purple Butterfly or Claire Denis's Beau Travail -- the last of which this film actually resembles quite a bit in the way it refuses to privilege, in fact glosses over, the usual dramatic highlights.But there are subtle changes to the formula, the kind of tweaks performed by a skilled mechanic on a recalcitrant Jaguar to make it good as new. The detested voiceovers, for example, mostly stay far from the cornpone 'My heart was heavy like a thundercloud' Carson McCullersisms that Malick usually favors, and that his amanuensis David Gordon Green has, over a regrettable series of films, rendered unuseable for at least the next two hundred years. Here they are fragmentary, shadows of thoughts more than coherent statements, and instead of stopping the action dead they're superimposed over the dialogue, which they interrupt, contradict, obscure and deepen. Fascinating stuff. For instance, there's a motif of Pocahontas saying 'Mother' in voice-over whenever she's in a prayerful mood, and this happens not only when she's staring out at the ( mother ) ocean but also when she's nibbling on Colin Farrell's ear. For her, everything is illuminated. Colin Farrell's voiceovers, in contrast, are self-doubting and waffling, to show how the shock of his experience with Pocahontas has betrayed his linear macho ambition. Malick is thinking symphonically to place us in the heads and hearts of personages long dead; he is using words paradoxically against themselves to destroy the equivocal and deceptive power that they have to betray the soul.Malick, like Michael Haneke with Cache, also seems to be advancing beyond that goofy liberal habit of 'implicating the audience.' Those who say that this movie is about nature's superiority to civilization -- and in their favor, there is a voice-over monologue by Colin Farrell as he rows upstream towards a native encampment that is very pagan-communist, 'Any man who labors honestly will be free from the stranglehold of landlords,' etc. -- may not have noticed that, later on, Pocahontas is sold out by her own people for a copper pot, or that Malick is anything but condescending towards her first exposure to Catholicism, that it in fact frames her experience and brings meaning to her private suffering in a way that epileptic tribal dances can't.",10,5,12,29 December 2005
Lucky Number Slevin," 10 years later and we're still here?
","I thought that, after so much time had passed, I could go to the theater with an easy mind and an open heart, unburdened by fears of another Tarantino knockoff. Back in the day, I sat through more than a few. And I'm not just talking about that one with Charlize Theron. Anyone remember Bulletproof Heart or Love and a .45? Needless to say, my hard-won innocence was betrayed. To the writer Paul Porizkovich, or whatever your name is, wheedle as many lunch offers at the Ivy as you can, because you'll be back in whatever bilgewater you crawled out of soon. I'd have more respect for someone who went around spray-painting babies than I do for you. Are there really still people walking around Hollywood thinking, 'I have a great idea! I'll make a gangster movie like The Usual Suspects or Pulp Fiction, but in this one the wallpaper'll be really funny!' When are those Iranians going to enrich their uranium already? Oh, they just did.The only member of cast and crew who comes out of this one unscathed is, shockingly, Josh Hartnett. He's also the only one who is still building a career and can be forgiven for appearing in such roadkill. The one smart move the director makes is to have his character's nose broken so that Hartnett's resemblance to Jean-Paul Belmondo becomes unmistakable. My girlfriend says he's the only male actor that she has a crush on, resulting in much scoffing from me -- too bad she refused to see this movie where she was unexpectedly vindicated. He gets the full star treatment here and pulls it off as well as anyone could under the circumstances. Despite his reputation as a grunting caveman with a unibrow, even Woody Allen couldn't have recited this verbal diarrhea any better. And I'm talking lines like, 'It's a condition I have called ataraxia' and 'Did anyone tell you should never put the word you're defining in a definition?' and 'On your face, there's a nose, and underneath that nose, there's a mouth.' Everyone else looks like a waxwork in a museum about to be burned down for the real estate. Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman do their overrated shtick which basically amounts to rolling vowels around and being poised and boring to show their almighty experience before the camera; both of them need to either take a huge risk or go away fast. A facelifted Bruce Willis brings back horrifying memories of Billy Bob Thornton's uncreased new visage in The Ice Harvest ( their faces now resemble children's hindquarters. ) And Lucy Liu goes for Young Shirley MacLaine but, flitting around the decade-younger Hartnett, comes off more Old Asian M.I.L.F. Without breaking a sweat, Hartnett wipes the floor with all of them -- and if that isn't more tragicomic than anything else going on in the story, then I'm Paris Hilton's latest conquest.",1,33,72,11 April 2006
Marie Antoinette," Beyond judgment.
","Marie Antoinette is probably the first film about this subject to START with the Revolution, as we see a voyeuristic shot of Kirsten Dunst bathing to Gang of Four's 'Natural is Not In It,' a song with some very pointed lyrics: 'The problem of leisure / What to do for pleasure / I do love a new purchase / A market of the senses.' It's as if we are in the mind of a peasant who, his fantasies inflamed by the gutter press, the rumors of wantonness and high living at Versailles, looks at his own life and, boiling over with sexual and economic jealousy, picks up an electric guitar and invents punk just to show his hatred for the rich bi--h who ruined his life. How did Coppola resist using 'God Save The Queen?'That burst of staged anger having passed, the rest of Marie Antoinette devotes itself to showing how the lower classes' hostility was or was not warranted. In a film full of Kubrick references, Marie herself is perhaps most like the corpulent recruit with the aristocratic name of 'Leonard Lawrence' in Full Metal Jacket, chewing a jelly donut mechanistically while his fellow soldiers do push-ups. 'They're paying for it it -- YOU eat it!' screams the drill sergeant. Marie Antoinette is a two-hour slo-mo of that jelly donut scene. She 'enjoys' herself because that's what a queen is expected to do; and then she pays with her life for fulfilling those expectations, just for playing her part. The point: Enjoyment, la jouissance, doesn't exist.Marie Antoinette seems like a poor little rich girl story. But that wouldn't explain the most touching scene in the film, when Rip Torn's Louis XV calls for his mistress on his deathbed, and we see his face crumple into pure grief when reminded that he'd already sent her away. Coppola's sign of maturity is that she extends her sympathy to everyone else in the story -- everyone except the peasants, that is, whose appearance in the final minutes is demonic enough to make you wonder how anyone could have ever thought a murderous mob was a triumphant expression of human liberty. Besides, Coppola tacitly suggests, if they had imagination, they could have wormed their way inside Versailles too ( Coppola's court is stocked with pop-culture royalty, after all, people who, like Asia Argento, may have been born into famous families but still had to prove their mettle. )Jason Schwartzman as King Louis XVI and Marie have a strange relationship. They never fall in love, but there is something exhilarating about the way, in each others' presence, they can let the masks drop and be the kids they are. Schwartzman subtly gains confidence and there are some moments towards the end, calling on Marie at Le Petit Trianon, where you get a brief glimpse of something special, something truly royal, waiting to emerge. Heartbreakingly, it never does; the mob arrives. But when at the end they go to prison, you flash back to the cardinals and priests at their wedding and think, maybe there is something to all this 'ridiculous' ceremony; maybe it was a heavenly and not an earthly marriage that was being arranged. And then you flash to the other scene where Marie and her friends are playing a guessing game with papers attached to their heads, each paper bearing a name -- one of the ladies-in-waiting has the name 'Jesus Christ' on her head and asks, 'Am I at this table?' and someone replies, 'You're always with us.' And then you realize just how many dimensions this film is working on.If this review seems scattershot and impressionistic, well, so is the film. I could probably write a little experimental essay for each individual scene. I'll spare you that, but Sophia ( and Roman, her brother, who I feel had a large hand in this production ) has proved that she has a soul after all. With soul, you can raise other souls from the dead, restore them to their original truth, to their innermost dreams and longings... And that's exactly what she's done here. Despite my utter hatred for Sophia's two previous films, I'll admit I think this is the best period piece ever, and that includes Barry Lyndon. Marie Antoinette is literally to die for, a glorious, melancholy poem about unborn angels on the edge of an endless dawn.",10,11,21,21 October 2006
American Psycho," Stalking contradiction.
","It must be said:  If I hadn't read Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho -- memorized it, in fact -- I don't think I would have had the slightest idea what was supposed to be happening in the movie.  A movie needs plot; this has none.  A movie needs momentum; you could rearrange the scenes from the first half of American Psycho in any order and no one would notice.  The ideas are confused, the structure is nonexistent, the dialogue is virtually inaudible under the INXS din, and Christian Bale has chosen an odd, odd time to reveal to the world that he is actually JIM CARREY, or at least an inbred cousin of his ( by the end Bale's impersonation of Carrey had become so distracting that I was basically sweating and gibbering along with the Bateman character. )So why did I like it so much?  Because I HAVE read the book, and the movie is a far more ruthless vivisection of Ellis than it is of the soulless, Reaganite, greed-driven 80's and all those boring received ideas that have been shoved down our throats by the media in the defanging process that the movie essentially represents.  Represents, I say, because when all the smoke has cleared ( what smoke? what am I talking about? ) the movie will probably be seen as the ideal complement to the book -- the two reflect on each other like brutally shattered mirrors.Basic summary:  The book is a comedy classic, with reams and reams of hilariously insipid yuppie repartee, but it was never as disturbing as the people who never bothered to read it thought.  The movie is disturbing.  In the book, when Patrick Bateman lures a prostitute back to his apartment for a second time after mutilating her in some undescribed way, it's just a joke, a variation on a theme.  But in the movie, the woman playing the prostitute has such a sad, symbolic, almost saintly face, that her death scene -- which is like one of the more unsubtle episodes of Itchy & Scratchy, by the way -- had even the people in the audience who were previously content to treat the whole thing as a joke actually GASPING.  It made me realize how really powerful and uncomfortable the book could have been if it dropped its protective mask of irony for a page or two.On the other hand, director Mary Harron sometimes plays it safe, content to deliver up little sushi slices of American Psycho's Greatest Hits -- the business card contretemps, the Huey Lewis exegesis, even a sign on a door that says 'This is not an exit.'  In moments like these the movie is Classics Illustrated, a reductio ad absurdum, the final proof that American Psycho has been chewed up by mama bird and made nice and mushy for baby bird's consumption.  It's too bad, because Harron has a very real gift for offbeat direction -- when she's on she's downright KUBRICKIAN, and from me this is the highest compliment imaginable.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
The Shining," Horror springs eternal.
","The Shining is an incredibly intricate hedge maze of a movie lurking beneath a leering death mask of bloodshed and mayhem.  Like Jack Torrance, Kubrick was undergoing a painful creative rebirth while making this movie, having traded in the spic-n-span philosophical certainties of A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove for a more ambiguous, intuitive kind of poetic logic. As a result, The Shining is not as satisfying as his previous films, not as surefooted or smugly self-confident.  Watching it can, on occasion, be as frustrating as watching a baby larva squirm free of its shell.  But it's also the most fascinating film Kubrick ever made, so odd and inhuman it's like something beamed down from another galaxy.It's hard to believe this gothic monstrosity had its humble origins in a Stephen King novel, but if you need proof, just look at all the clueless dingbats who prefer the 'faithful' miniseries.  Granted, King and Kubrick were uniquely ill-matched -- while the former is all about surface incident, beasties and aliens and spiders, the latter places the emphasis on subtext, what roils and stirs BENEATH the surface.  Stephen King's novel of The Shining, like all his novels, is as flat as a pancake and profoundly unscary.  That's why people read him at the beach.Kubrick grafts about twenty dimensions onto the painfully thin story and arrives at something altogether more ineffable and... 'Kubrickian' is the only real word for it.  He taps into a host of fears, most of them embedded so deeply in our psyches we don't know they're there -- or if we do, have long since given up trying to express them ( and I'm not talking about the fear of being attacked by a wigged-out Jack Nicholson, although more than a few motorists in this city are traumatized by just that possibility)Kubrick gets plenty of eerie mileage, for instance, out of our fear of not only death, but of obsolescence, as embodied by the gaily-attired reveller-ghosts of The Gold Room.  The presence of this completely dead world, with its dead music and dead fashions, serves to remind us that the world we live in now is equally doomed, along with everyone in it.  This lends a whiff of mortality to the proceedings -- a whiff so pungent it can even carry over into real life.  Just go to a party after watching the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about.  People appear silly and unreal, like chattering skeletons.There's also the primal and universal childhood fear of seeing our fathers turn on us, but this website is not the place to get into all that.  For now, just let me say that Nicholson is a grinning Beelzebub beyond compare, Shelley Duvall is as impossibly elongated as a Kafka sketch come to life, and the gay guy in the bear suit really weirds me out.I recommend you watch The Shining back-to-back with Roman Polanski's The Tenant.  Both deal with the recurrence of psychosis and the endless cycle of violence.  Polanski's film is funny and kitschy, however, which keeps it from achieving the same kind of nightmarish stranglehold.",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
American Beauty," American Analgesic.
","It's a sorry state of affairs when a movie masterminded by the creator of 'Cybill' is treated as the second coming, but for once I can understand the hoopla.  American Beauty is a very seductive film -- so seductive that it's easy to overlook the fact that it amounts to roughly bubkes.  It's ironic that the tagline is 'Look closer,' because this movie ONLY holds up when left unexamined -- under scrutiny, it crumbles like Annette Bening's empowered-woman facade.What an anomaly!  Scene-by-scene American Beauty is brilliant; overall, it's shoddily conceived, full of holes, and more than a little sophistic.  At the end -- don't worry, I won't spoil anything worth spoiling -- Kevin Spacey's character says ( in voiceover, yech ) something about how we must enjoy the little things in life, and that's basically the whole philosophy here; true child-of-the-60's stuff.  Just to take a small example of the film's many missteps, Spacey -- who has undergone a Kubrickian metamorphosis from downsized sadsack to teenager reborn -- makes a break with his materialistic, status-seeking past by... Buying a car?  Drinking beer? EXERCISING?  Excuse me, but isn't that what yuppies do?  And there's a mistake within a mistake here, because no one who has suddenly become a fitness nut would also become a drunkard at the same time, even if he is trying to show his wife how liberated he is.As for the director, Sam Mendes, let's just say that the guy definitely knows his way around a camera but fudges a few things, most notably the substory of Spacey's crush on his daughter's best friend.  Middle-aged men who want to prong underaged girls generally do not fantasize about them shooting rose petals from their chests, not even if those middle-aged men are professional poets, which Lester -- who writes ad copy -- is most assuredly not.  Subliminal cuts of the girl in various pornographic poses would have been more honest, but then again, this movie is about as edgy as a donut, despite what the critics will tell you, and always opts for prettiness over provocation.Now for the good news:  American Beauty is a rare case of a film where the actors are more important than anyone behind the camera, and all the actors -- except Annette Bening, who appears to have been coached by a different director than everyone else, perhaps Friz Freleng -- rise to the occasion admirably.  Especially Kevin Spacey.  He has been impressive before, of course, but here he's simply... Well, 'Voila un homme,' to quote Napoleon. He's the essence of humanity, as hyperbolic as that sounds.  Thank god for this man who doesn't indulge in Oscar moments, never cries, never speechifies, just radiates intelligence and common sense and joy in his own talent.  His performance and character make the movie great, even though it's not a great movie, and he has now officially paid Pacino back for his reported rudeness on the set of Glengarry Glen Ross by becoming a much better actor.  Headhunters of the press, DO NOT ask this man if he's gay again -- he needs to be free to play whoever he wants.  Julia Roberts already has her tart-tongued sidekick, okay?  Leave the guy alone.The high school scenes in American Beauty were shot at my alma mater, by the way.  I don't know why I feel compelled to mention this but I do.  I almost fainted dead away at the sight of those Spartanettes.  Ah, the memories...",Null,0,0,18 September 1999
Batman Begins," Batman for the Coldplay generation.
","The moral absolutes of comic-book movies have never seemed so relevant as now, as Star Wars: Episode III and Sin City brilliantly showed ( Yellow Bastard's castration will go down in history as the great shared moment of anti-Bush catharsis. ) But Christopher Nolan's dreadfully earnest Batman Begins is too obvious in its attempts to draw parallels with America's current malaise, and may ultimately tip the scales back to Joel Schumacher's neon-ribbed codpieces. Nolan strikes me as a calculating, soulless filmmaker who should be making movies about Rubber Man, as he twists himself into a Superpretzel trying to please the comic-book mavens, the intellectuals, the Friday-night date crowd, the SUV driving suburbanites, the sensitive artistes AND the action fans. But a Batman movie is not the place for him to trot out his knowledge of German literature and philosophy ( Novalis and Nietzsche, primarily. ) It sort of reminds me of all those Yale grads who end up writing sitcoms and Pixar animated features, and who drop various arcane references in order to pretend to themselves that they haven't sold out. This movie may seem to have integrity at first, but a closer examination will reveal just how made-by-committee it is.What really torpedoes the project, though, is something much simpler -- Nolan has no style, no juice, no cinematic blood in his veins. Did anyone really want to see a Batman movie directed by Sidney Lumet? Who wants to see anonymous drug-runners, cops with greasy mustaches and dull British character actors in this kind of movie? The only supervillian, The Scarecrow, is played by 20-something Cillian Murphy, and his scenes with the equally juvenile Katie Holmes make the audience feel as if they're sitting in on a laid-back acting class on Santa Monica Boulevard. There is a lack of imagination in the action scenes that will become fatally apparent to even the most impressed fans once they get this movie on DVD. This film is born to collect dust. There's not one memorable setpiece in the entire movie, nothing like the museum sequence in Burton's Batman that could put this over the top -- just lots of generic karate shot close-in. The big showdown at the end is like something out of the Speed movies.Ang Lee's version of Hulk -- the underrated trailblazer among the Serious Comic Book Movies, and the one that will stand the test of time -- is the perfect marriage of pop thrills and myth-savvy credibility. Almost every scene is memorable, from Hulk's eerily quiet rageout in in the desert, to his Shakespeareanly wordy confrontation with father Nick Nolte. It not only starts out as realistic and plausible as this Batman, but has the courage to plunge into the irrational and abstract at the end. Batman Begins, by contrast, is a dead weight, a humorless 70's cop show tarted up with cod philosophy.",4,11,23,19 June 2005
