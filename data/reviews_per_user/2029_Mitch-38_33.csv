50 First Dates," ROM-COM WITH GOOD HUMOR, BUT DOES WEAR THIN AT TIMES
","*WARNING--Possible spoilers*: Nice romantic comedy with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in the leads. There are some serious laugh out loud moments, mostly due to Rob Schneider's character, 'ULA.' It centers around an outdoor theme park vet who falls for a sweet lady in a restaurant, in Hawaii. The main problem with 50FD is that how does one overcome the repetitive, proverbial 'One Trick Pony' joke that surrounds Barrymore's character? Well, outlandish attempts on Sandler's part to keep continually wooing her helps. However, it tends to make the pic drag here and there, and sometimes this gets more than slightly tedious. The chemistry is better than average between them, and it shows. Unfortunately 50FD also commits a droll sin of introducing animals for cutesy, quasi-humorous moments, and tries to play that for laughs, too. Nice try, but doesn't get Nanna a new pair of shoes. Dan Aykroyd is painfully dull as the physician who's treating Barrymore's character, which doesn't help the film one iota. Throw in a few zany locals, and several earnest attempts at poignancy; and you've scored about a mixed bag. There's some crude humor, so early Sandler fans won't be disappointed. The ending was very sweet, yet was a welcome sight, as 50FD also runs pretty long in the tooth at 99 minutes. It certainly wasn't awful, that's for sure. In fact, 50FD would be a pretty smart date movie or a couple of chuckles on a rainy afternoon. In lieu of this benefit, I recommend it. RECOMMENDED.",7,1,2,1 August 2004
Se7en," Taut Thriller-Beware of weak ending
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Eerie, atmospheric and particularly gruesome crime drama, understandably rate R. The constant analogies between this movie and 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,' should be spared. The differences outweigh the similarities.The disturbing premise is about a homicidal lunatic killing people he feels that are violating the proverbial seven deadly sins (Sloth, Pride, Covetousness, Lust, Envy, Gluttony and Anger, for those like myself, who occasionally dozed through Catechism). The picture starts in a low whir and builds intensity, with applied layers. The tempo throughout is gloomy, dark and pervasive, and frankly, it works well for the film. The script is full of loop-de-loop twists and is explicit. It doesn't bore and doesn't skim, which is a credit to the screenwriters. Effectively, you won't feel your IQ has been undervalued. The performances are well above average.The major problem with SEVEN is the tepid ending. For the final scenes, you'll have to stretch your suspension of belief from here to Moscow and back. I simply just didn't buy it. The dimension between the severity of the crimes and the weak, impudent and predictable ending, just didn't quite jibe. The screenplay zipped along and felt like it simply...ran out of gas.",7,1,2,27 January 2001
The Big Lebowski," Great moments...Eventually loses momentum
","Very offbeat, highly original movie that provides tie ins for mistaken identity, some effective and hilarious characters and off the wall situations. Unpredictable and free spirited, the 'Dude', our protagonist gets caught in a web of intrigue. This intrigue seemingly and annoyingly takes him away from his happy life of apathy, unemployment and bowling. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is strictly Coen Brothers madness, in the vein of RAISING ARIZONA. The visuals, dream sequences, et al, are very funny and fit well in the movie. Unfortunately, the last half starts to slow down, as the characters start to seem repetitive in their reactions. The humor also waned, due to this, and the plot, not the film's strong suit to begin with, wears down with it. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is still yards ahead of most mainstream releases, yet we've grown rather accustomed (even spoiled) to expect so much more from the Coens. Recommended.",6,2,5,25 February 2001
The 13th Warrior," Intelligent, yet dull
","Intelligently scripted and crafted, THE 13TH WARRIOR delivers well. However, when the action stops, and the long expanse of verbiage kicks in...the film comes to a screeching halt. Omar Sharif is not put to good use, as the main character's translator. Frankly, little more than a cameo spot.Entertaining enough, yet not for the short of patience.",6,0,0,3 March 2000
Batman Returns," Nice Try
","Undeniably weaker entry in the second installment of this series of films. The production values are still high, yet the execution came off weak. This is unfortunate, as BATMAN RETURNS had everything going for a worthwhile sequel. You had the stars...righto! You had Tim Burton...righto! You had the great supporting cast, musical score and those effects...righto! You had the screenplay...UH-OH....The story really did come off as one long homily about not looking down on people that we perceive as different. I can relate and think that is fine, but not for the length of the movie. Besides, I'm not ready to start thinking that all six billion of us on the planet need to be told such lessons in such a heavy handed nature. The character development came off as trying to fit too much, in one setting. The Penguin's character, in trying to be scary, degenerated into camp and became an object of humor. To see Devito's character traipsing about the underground sewers of Gotham, in those colossal, filthy undies bemoaning the fact that folks find him less than desirable, came off as somewhat ludicrous. Also, a question popped into my head while viewing this. If he spent all his time in the sewer, how did he eat? I mean the guy is tremendously obese. Who fed him? Ed Norton from 'The Honeymooners'? Also, I heard a rumor that penguins can be found in cold climates, like Antarctica, and generally not in our sewers. I realize this is supposed to be fantasy, yet let's not make simpletons out of the audience, please.The only saving grace in the whole shebang is Pfeiffer's Catwoman character. She basically stole the show, and is by far the most interesting character. Michael Keaton is solid, but like Danny Devito, are anchored down by the limited, innocuous scope of the script.  A small smudge off the neighbor's hibachi could have saved Warner Brothers a lot of loot, and the audience a lot of pain. This movie is by no means a dud, it merely means that with the right factors going, BATMAN RETURNS had the potential for a great film, instead of a so-so one. Recommended only for diehard fans, others should be wary of this weak fare.",4,42,69,27 January 2001
The Mummy," Pretty Good Actioner
","Seems to lean rather heavily on RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK escapades, yet has a few good moments. The leads are appealing (Fraser & Weisz), and the story doesn't take itself too seriously. The cameo from Bernard Fox came off as needless, as it was eyeblink quick and more gratuitous than most cameos. More young people were spouting 'Professor Bombay' in the theater...God Bless 'Nick at Night' or pre-press hype, whichever you prefer.    The special effects were quite entertaining, if not downright reminiscent of the choreography used in Michael Jackson's 'CHILLER' video.    The baddie was exceptional (Arnold Vosloo), being menacing, but not over the top, ham-handed. His character was intelligently, and thoughtfully portrayed. Overall, despite its cheek and borrowed elements, THE MUMMY is better than average. Recommended.",6,0,0,3 March 2001
Brokeback Mountain," A Piece of American Western Heritage which happens to be Gay
","CAUTION TO THE READER-SPOILERS AHEAD: Director Ang Lee's film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN delves deeply into the American psyche. A psyche of puritanical, almost rabid, reverence for the cowboy myths and legend. They were truly the U.S. version of 'The Nobility of the Sword.' They entered hostile and unknown lands, making a slow path for the rest of immigrant and established America to follow westward. Some of it is bona fide American history, much of it sketchy legend. Then, we flash forward to the early 1960's where the last bastion of independent cowboy employment is reaching its finale, of sorts. They are lone cowboys not belonging or working for any particular ranch. Against this backdrop is where we meet the main characters of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two drifters looking for work in Wyoming.The work is hard and the pay was low, however these were men who needed money. We, as viewers, take this journey with them and discover an indirect affection between them. As this affection evolves into the physical act of love, we find both characters struggling with their perceptions built upon their life up to now, and their emotions. For individual reasons and reasoning, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar keep their love, yet lose their happiness, much due to the mores and times in which they live. One of these men find life away from Wyoming, and moves to Texas. His life takes a path where he doesn't want it to go, yet makes his way with success in a chameleon-like existence. He is bold and visionary, and not afraid of life's chances, if only the man he loves would dare to jump for the brass ring of happiness. He is not interested in a solo act, it has to be a team effort. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are simply great. A standout performance is delivered by Michelle Williams as Alma, and Anne Hathaway as Lureen. Graham Beckel and Randy Quaid provide solid, entertaining support. Peter McRobbie and Roberta Maxwell are terrific, as Jack's parents. The viewer cannot help but get involved into the lives of these men. The fluidity of the screenplay, thanks to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana the screenwriters, keep your interest in the raw emotions, subtle tenderness and warm humor of the plight of these two men. It illustrates the anguish that such relationships with men or women can be wrought when true honesty is absent. The screenplay succeeds most of the time in its intent. Unfortunately, it tends to falter near the critical juncture of its conclusion. No one is saying these two should hold hands and go skipping off into the sunset. That certainly would not have been a realistic ending, considering the travails of Ennis and Jack. A tender, yet long overdue understanding and acceptance of each other would have sufficed. However, the oldest cliché in Hollywood history was dusted off, and presented as the dessert, after a spectacular five course meal. I'll let you ponder a guess. Question: In Hollywood film production, when two star-crossed lovers meet and pursue romance, you can almost bet your last check that one of them will...? a) Win the lottery. b) Move to The Netherlands where it's not illegal. or c) Get whacked or murdered. It is a strong critique of an otherwise brilliant movie. Therefore, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is certainly well above average, and worthy of your consideration for emotional and intellectually stimulating entertainment. You will not be disappointed in the least. The almost 2.5 hour run flows effortlessly by, due in large thanks to the pacing by director Lee. Highly Recommended.",7,9,13,31 January 2006
X-Men," Extremely Mediocre
","The pondersome task for the folks at Marvel and 20th Century Fox, is to produce a movie that will satisfy the fans of the comic, and those that haven't the foggiest notion of what the story is about. This made for long and protracted explaining all throughout the screenplay. This also meant that a lot a times, the action came to a deadening stop, more often than not. Movies have to give the audience breathing room, but this film gave too much, to the point where things started getting...well...dull. The performances were okay, with Halle Berry being the standout as 'Storm.' Patrick Stewart underplayed his role to the point of casting a wooden pall over the character. Ian Mckellan was good in his role as 'Magneto.' He showed wonderfully sublime self-control, as his character could have beened hammed up badly. They made a wise choice using Sir Ian in this role.
A mention might go out to parents, who are contemplating bringing the kids. There's a few scenes that are more than slighty graphic in their violent content. I was frankly astonished to see parents with toddlers in their arms, in the same theater. Some scenes could be a tad unsettling.Overall, while the film did not live up to its far-flung hype (which ones do?), it isn't terrible either. Just a bubble over average.",6,0,0,16 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Atmospheric Chiller
","Tim Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW is a pretty good flick, which combines good elemental story telling with exceptional special effects. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci in the leads, lend their solid performances with the gloomy settings. The inisde jokes were good relief, in the midst of the gruesome plot. There was at least a few good references (wink-wink) to the 1958 Disney telling of this story, as well. The supporting cast was also quite good, with Jeffrey Jones, who always lends his best in any picture I've seen him in. The cameos, including the legendary Christopher Lee, were fun. Add Christopher Walken, who chew up a scene as if it were mincemeat, and we've got some great inspired casting. He clearly relished his role. Good for him! The music score by Danny Elfman was outstanding. Overall, a good pcture. The only drawbacks I encountered was the story twists started becoming predictable, and that resolution seemed pretty weak. A rather lackluster wrap up, to an otherwise exciting outing.",7,0,0,22 September 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'WE MUST NOT ALLOW A MINE SHAFT GAP!!!'
","Pitch black comedy that finds humor in the unimaginable, due to its outstanding direction, great performances and tight, witty script. This is director Stanley Kubrick, at his best. The use of tight angles, eerie B&W photography and great pacing are key assets. The menacing aspect of such a situation, treated with such over the top style by Kubrick, will solidify this film as 'one to watch' for generations to come.The performances are super, with Scott and Sellers leading the way. The script is a stellar piece of brilliance by Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George (who wrote the original novel). The balance of subtlety and mind-zinging absurdity empowers a raw, distinctive genius to the screenplay.
Those who don't pay much attention to the dialogue, will be crinkling their noses and mumbling, 'What's so funny?' The intensity of this farce lies as much with the spoken word, as it does the physical. The humor pokes fun at bureaucracy, blind patriotic zeal, hypocrisy and human nature.DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB was courageous, landmark film making for it's time. The USAF was going to cooperate with the making, until the brass read the script. It was simply too much for sterile defense department types, which alone should let you know, it's a great movie. A definite classic, worth ringing up the boss to call in sick for. Highly recommended.",10,1,1,19 June 2002
Fargo," Hollywood-Take a lesson
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Desperate car dealer in quest for cash is basically the premise. Crimes are committed. The chief of police is on the case, and she is nobody's fool. FARGO has more twists than a bag of pretzels. It is also one of, if not, the best American made films of 1996. Intelligent scripting. Great also, was the earnest presentation of the peculiar dialect of many folks of Scandinavian heritage, who reside in the 'Land Of 10,000 Lakes.' Deep, rich character portrayals, without the silly, hackneyed Hollywood shtick getting in the way. Accolades for Macy and McDormand, and a solid supporting cast. Harve Pressnell is a standout, who doesn't 'muck' things up. Macy's character literally falls apart before our eyes. Another excellent film from Joel and Ethan Coen. Don't miss this one.",9,0,0,15 January 2001
American Pie," Good for laughs Gen-X comedy
","Another easy Hollywood 'we know where the money is' plot formula, marketing heavily at those discretionary incomes. Four comely lads looking to lose their virginity, as they're tired of just being comely. Yes, as I recall in high school, it was always the good looking dudes that had the toughest time scoring... Okay, now that we understand the movie isn't exactly grounded in reality, it is actually pretty funny in quite a few spots. Yes, the humor tends towards the raunchy, and one won't need a discussion group after, yet the performances are rather endearing and earnest. This helps AMERICAN PIE considerably, and keeps it on track towards its audience. Light fare worth a look.",6,0,0,25 February 2001
Cast Away," Good Movie with Good Lessons
","Exceptional story of typical American corporate type who pushes and bullies foreign nationals on their own soil, (the suitcase full of American ingenuities like candy bars and portable CD players he used to 'tip' the delivery boy was simply vile...), and develops a change of priorities when he's stranded on 'an unchartered desert isle.' The periods of silence and observance of the character was interesting, and much akin to the 1968 HELL IN THE PACIFIC. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, especially if they're weened on 'bang-zoom, where's-the-bodycount?' type of entertainment.
The intelligence and interesting plot of this story clears lies in it's simplicity of story telling. Tom Hanks did a super job with the character, his strengths, frailties, and more importantly...his regrets. Helen Hunt was super as his girlfriend. A good movie that succeeds in weaving a good tale, without moralizing the audience to sleep.",8,0,0,19 June 2001
Pitch Black," Mediocre Time-Filler
","Scifi ALIEN clone stirs up a couple of good scares and good big screen viewing effects. Unfortunately, PITCH BLACK suffers from way too many predictable action sequences, and an already all too familiar plotline. This, combined with its two hour length (90 minutes could have easily done the trick) really dulls the senses of even hardcore fans of the genre.",5,0,0,3 March 2000
American Psycho," A Perfect Allegory of American Greed & Mentality
","*Caution-Some potential spoilers ahead* Rarely has a motion picture aimed to capture the essence of its subject, and succeed so well. Christian Bale in AMERICAN PYSCHO nails this one to the wall, if you'll pardon the expression.
The main focus is the opulent, orgiastic greed of the 1980's, although it could be any real place in present time, as well. Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street broker on the verge of going insane. Bateman's world of picture-perfect world of defoliating skin creams and two o'clock tanning appointments; hides the facade of a man who is not there, nothing, except for his continuing spiral into the abyss.The reality of his world, which really comes down to one-upsmanship among his cronies and his social circle; who don't listen or care about each other, anyway. The nothingness of it grows to the point Bateman cannot return, with hellish consequences for those unfortunate to be in his path.  
AMERICAN PSYCHO is a well-crafted film, with extremely quirky bits of humor and is well-acted. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,21 December 2001
U-571," The Sub Floated - The Picture Tanked
","Bogus, revisionist Hollywood potboiler about American sub crew attempting to steal Enigma Decoding machine from German stranded sub. Naturally, we're treated to subtle reasons why those Germans are a nasty lot, as they machine gun survivors off of sunken vessel. Very subtle. Obviously, no one on the Production crew ever heard of Blechly Park or the fact that the British actually retrieved the first one. Yup, nothing like filling up your chest with steam, and stealing thunder from your allies. This aside, it's a relatively weakly acted movie, with stereotypical one dimensional performances and tons o' special effects. See it if you're snowed in, other than that, leave this floating bilge pumper alone. Not recommended.",3,3,7,3 March 2001
The Patriot," THIS IS JUNK
","It's shiny. It's got lots of effects. It's got big stars. It's junk. Throw-away, mindlessly manipulative hogwash from director Roland Emmerich. A fair minded and truthful view of history does matter, when making a film against a historical backdrop. Also, the homespun, lowbrow corniness of a couple of scenes; truly made a bad situation worse. THE PATRIOT plays like a quickie (and very stilted) morality play, that might have been well plucked from an old, cartoon POPEYE THE SAILOR short. Poor meek Mel goes through all of this sheer, hellish barbaric treatment at the hands of Colonel Tavington. Well, you know, even meek Mel has his breaking point, and everyone knows; you don't wanna go there, girl. (They used terms like this in 18th century New England, didn't they?)Eeghads...those rascally British types have just 'offed' another of Mel's family. Cue Mel. 'That's all I can stands, 'cause I can't stands no more!!!' Cue Mel and spinach can. Furious 'whoop-azzzz' follows. Roll credits. Roland baby, we're outta here. Time for some knockwurst. Seriously, not since Charles Bronson in DEATHWISH (and the subsequent and seemingly endless sequels), has someone so mercilessly lost their family members and mounted such stunning revenge. THE PATRIOT is heavy-handed, manipulative, dishonest (in it's view of well-known and documented history of the Revolutionary War of The American Colonies) and corny, to boot. This is junk to be avoided at all costs.
NOT RECOMMENDED.",1,12,25,19 March 2002
Van Helsing," Van Help Me, This Was Not Very Good
","The star of this film, known to many of us, as CGG (Computer Generated Graphics) does well, despite its overuse and obvious animation. This is a rehash of many a horror film, and when one is retooling it for an updated modern version (as they will in the future for this popular genre), the screenwriters and director need to add an essential, original point that will make people stand up and take notice. VH has no such originality, nor zing. Hugh Jackman delivers such a wooden performance, one is terribly tempted to call Geppetto to see if he was missing one of his puppets. The chemistry between his character and Ms. Beckinsale's character is so poor; I was assuming he was gay. Not that there's anything wrong about that, and it would have been a cool and groundbreaking route to go with this venerated character of horror movie lore. Once again, I digress to hint of any originality which could spice up a deadly dull flick like this one. Kate Beckinsale does sparkle in her role, exuding sexuality and vim, which saved this writer from having to rate this whole escapade as a bomb/turkey/junk/pond water, etc. Also, Richard Roxburgh, who literally and figuratively chews upon the scenery like an Atkins diet drop out on a loaf of fresh baked pumpernickel. Richard had a good time with this role, and it shows, as his relish is strong. Aside from these, the film get stodgy, dull and CGC happy for most of its cruel, crushing 132 minutes. The Hyde character, conveniently borrowed from another turkey (League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen...*yawn*) doesn't perk up the production a flip. A lot more backfires than starts, in what should have been a fun romp around the macabre side. Instead, VAN HELSING tries to dazzle us with poor animation and script, as well. As I stopped yawning, pondering this picture, I regain the senses enough to type out the following words: NOT RECOMMENDED.",3,0,1,1 August 2004
Rocky IV," HEADY DOSE OF PAP
","Infantile tripe of the Rockster one more time 'givin' it all he got...', this time to the bad Russkies. What it is essentially, is one of those mindless, feel good, manipulative, American movies that succeeds in only being mindless. The only interesting scenes in the whole mess, is when the Soviet national anthem is being played, Rocky and Drago stare away at each other in a homeoerotic fashion. Some pretty intense cruising there, which was interesting, unlike 99% of the rest of the film. Alas, the rest could have been ground under the wheels of a combine in Mother Russia, and we'd have owed her a favor for it. Oh-And don't miss the finale where Rocky gurgles into the microphone for what seems like hours, talking about '...change this...' and '...change that...' I couldn't decipher if Rocky was talking about a diaper or the tape, however both would be welcome as opposed to watching this movie again.",1,12,25,3 July 2001
Dark City," AN EERIE AND FASCINATING TALE
","On the side of honesty, I'll admit that I'm not much of a sci-fi buff. However, the title and talented ensemble involved, intrigued me. WOW! What an odd, murky and thoroughly engrossing motion picture! An extra plus is the well-done special effects. Rufus Sewell is super as the lead, whose line between reality and dreams is merely millimeters thin. Keifer Sutherland is downright bizarre as the doctor. (As an actor, this man's range is limitless). William Hurt gives a superb, subdued performance as the detective. The untied shoelace bit, is quick and clever. Dark City is a well-paced, moody, interesting and creative movie; very well worth your time.",9,0,1,13 June 1999
Independence Day," Intense special effects
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The movie itself, is apocalyptic entertainment that flies off the Richter scale. The special effects are first rate. Merging this with a string of bare bone vignettes of people, brought together by a cataclysmic event. That being, large UFO hovering over cities of the planet.
The sequence of events revolves around the plot that the UFO's arrive, the military sends up a 'Welcome Wagon' and it gets zapped. All Hades breaks loose. From there, it's the humans versus the homicidally-inclined side of ET's family. The humor is tongue in cheek, and although not void of a lot of end-of-the-world cliches, it's still a lot of fun. As an extra bonus, the soundtrack is great. Randy Quaid is terrific. This movie, like a nuclear blast, will send you out glowing. Recommended.",7,0,0,21 January 2001

The Mummy Returns," THIS FORMULA HAS DRIED UP LIKE AN ANCIENT MUMMY
","Very long, cumbersome, pondersome and sleep inducing sequel to Brendan Fraser's entertaining 'THE MUMMY.' The film simply went into too much simplistic detail, and the occasional homily. The worst part about this movie was the utter lack of suspense. Any indication of genuine starts or shocks were well telegraphed in advance, again hurting the overall efforts of the picture to entertain.

Mission: Impossible," Techno fluff
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* A typical nuts-and-bolts storyline that Hollywood is sooooo comfortable with. Ye Ole 'agent that has outlived his usefulness, so it's time to retire them permanently...' practice. Anyone who has followed THE EQUALIZER, EYE SPY or the original series from which this film is based, is certainly not unfamiliar with the plot. Add to this some nifty special effects and gadgetry, and you've got a time worn plot with a new wrapping. Of course, throw in the usual percentage of spy idioms, too.  The team does a 'job', then proceeds to get knocked off, except for Tom Cruise. Tom's out there and alone. Tom desperately tries to contact the 'company.' Tom is scared. Tom forgot his dental floss. See Tom Run. Tom can't even manage a goofy smile. They try to kill Tom. Tom's having a bad hair day.What happens for the rest of this flick, is a whirlwind of incredible improbability and a seething lack of tension. In-between muffled protests of 'No way' and the physical sense of my eyelids getting heavy, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is about as suspenseful as watching a plumber unclog a drain. Ms. Redgrave's performance is little more than a cameo, which is a true waste of a gifted actress.In summation, when the best thing you can say about a motion picture is that the peppy theme song (recycled from the tv series) still sounds good, it's time to fold the tent.",3,1,6,15 January 2001
Stalingrad," Hell Frozen Over
","Absorbing, horrendous descent into the nightmare of combat. Focusing on the invading German army (into the Soviet Union) in the second world war, the impact no less awful. These men are enlisted men, who had no more control over their government's criminal actions, than US troops had over their government during the Vietnam War. Or any government sending their military in any war, for that matter. To assume they could belies a certain lack of acquaintance or experience, with the structure of a military organization.These men are trapped like rats, and survival at any cost, to preserve ones life is paramount. Politics and lofty notions fly out the window, as the veneer of civilized behavior is stripped off.STALINGRAD is gripping, grotesque, poignant and pitiful in its graphic presentation of war time experience. Highly recommended.",8,72,85,30 January 2001
From Hell," GROSSED-OUT ANATOMY
","Pretty standard costumer with a mystery motif, and tons o' gore to keep the adolescents enthralled. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, FROM HELL has much going for it, however the writing tended to be poor and the plot really held no surprises. Johnny Depp rose above the material more than once, and he usually does. Robbie Coltrane was wasted as not much more than a flunky for Depp. Anyone who has seen Coltrane in the British series CRACKER knows this man can act. Heather Graham did a great job, and was wholly believable. Those 'oh so terrible' British actors, naturally play the baddies. Ian Holm, a mesmerizing actor, takes center stage here and clearly relishes the role. 
The script really sinks the ship. The unsustained and at times, complete lack of suspense brings FROM HELL down to the level of a 'game show,' in terms of tension. Gratuitous violence never takes the place of suspense, but that doesn't stop screenwriters and directors from trying. Nice try...no cookie. Yes, the crimes of Jack the Ripper were indeed grotesque, however more was spent on faithfully rendering these scenes out, than the effort to peel away the layers of the story and where it was going.
The conclusion bordered on the silly and camp (HM Queen Victoria makes a couple of cameos...good grief!), making the preceding time spent not really worth the while. My conclusion is that FROM HELL is a good costumer, but the overall effect is razzle-dazzle to disguise a stilted and clumsy script.

Enemy at the Gates," Better than average-Yet So Much Wasted Potential
","It made headlines. It made bucks. (The real measure of success, I suppose for Hollywood poobahs). ENEMY AT THE GATES made for an interesting story, but only so long as the film stayed running. It could have been memorable, but it just turned out to be another night at the movies. What a shame.The six month siege of Stalingrad was historically such a horrendous conflagration, one could understand the producers wanting to keep the scope small in perspective. Yet, the many aspects of suffering by its citizenry was overlooked. One never got the feel or sense of suffering, of the inhabitants. The thousands who perished, not from German bullets or bombs, but simply starvation. This is never explored. The refugees or people who tried to leave the city, en masse. From this film's very limited point of view, Stalingrad is empty, except for Ed and Jude, and company.
The performances were earnest and above average, except for Bob Hoskin' s Nikita Kruschev. The normally superb Hoskins played Kruschev poorly, i.e. an utter boob. It was hard to stifle a laugh. '...Lose yourself!' indeed. Ed Harris steals the show, as the aristocratic Major Konig, just by the subtlety of his performance. Three quarters through the movie, unfortunately, he jumps into hyper-nasty German mode (a characterization seen in zillions of movies) and the cliche plays out. I'm surprised he didn't stop into a bomb shelter to mow down a thousand babushkas, before meeting up for his final showdown with Vassili. Any personal sense of honor the character possessed went out the window, to prop up a cliche.If one is looking for a serious sense of a historical event, skip this one. Try STALINGRAD, a German movie about this event (see prior review), which might bring the overall horror of Stalingrad into view. ENEMY AT THE GATE, while above average and recommended, came off more like HIGH NOON without the horses.",7,0,0,19 August 2001
The Green Mile," WELL TOLD FICTIONAL TALE OF MIRACLES
","Uplifting, sad and eerie film that sends the viewer into the world of the 1930's, in a southern US prison, and specifically death row. 
The cast is sterling. Tom Hanks again catches the everyman in all of us, with a rarity that hasn't been seen by a US actor, since Spencer Tracey or James Stewart. Micahel Clarke Duncan is fantastic as John Coffey; he's part Edgar Cayce, Jesus Christ and Bubba Smith! With support from James Cromwell, David Morse, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Doug Hutchinson, Sam Rockwell and more. A great ensemble cast, that worked incredibly well. A special mention has to go to Dabbs Greer, whose performance was so moving.
The film tells a wonderful story. The characters are rich, unique and believable. Kudos for the directing and screenplay (Frank Darabont) from the Stephen King novel.Roses all the way around. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,7 January 2002
The Waterboy," Physical, dumb humor for the masses
","Never mind the slow, plodding start. If your aim is to laugh, this movie delivers. Don't waste your time trying to find high art in this flick, just sit back and enjoy. If moronic, physical humor isn't your thing, then you might want to pass on this one.",6,1,1,26 November 1998
The Sixth Sense," Exceptional Film
","Kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for bringing such a good film as THE SIXTH SENSE to such a fine realization. A Philadelphia child psychiatrist probes a disturbed child, who may lead him to a discovery of his own. It reaches its audience with intelligence and thoughtful, explicit dialogue, not manipulation. We find ourselves brought in by the deft hand of the director, who culls the best out of his actors.
Bruce Willis has really turned in a wonderful performance here, as has Haley Joel Osment. Roses all around for the cast and director (who was also wrote the screenplay), of this powerful and spellbinding supernatural thriller. 
Not to be missed. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,10 April 2002
Thirteen Days," Above average portrayals-Lopsided Film
","I'll be the first to admit, I love history and international politics. That's the primary factor that drew me to THIRTEEN DAYS. Yes, since Kevin Costner was in it, I figured JFK would be lionized (and he was). No poolside parties in this picture. The situation is extreme. The most glaring distraction away from this motion picture, is Costner's Harvard-inspired, jackhammer-to-the-skull accent. The fact that it fades in and out does not help. The portrayals by virtually a whole troupe of players is exceptional, with Steven Culp as RFK, the standout. Michael Fairman was excellent as Adlai Stevenson (uncredited role no less!). THIRTEEN DAYS explores the certain factions within the US government, and tactics used to address the crisis. There is little or no action sequences to speak of, yet through a well written script, there is a great deal of tension. What would have made THIRTEEN DAYS more interesting, would have been the exploration of the reasoning and motivations for the Soviets to place missiles in Cuba. Was it over Berlin? Was it over our missiles aimed directly at them from Turkey? I'm sure Premier Khruschev didn't provide Cuba with this kind of heavy duty equipment on a whim. With access to people near Khruschev (of those times) easier during these times, this would have balanced the film out. His son became a US citizen not too long ago.
Why not present both sides? The only people who present only one side (as the Soviet government did many times in its past), is indicative of those who have something to hide. Why not show both sides playing global chess? It would have made for a more resoundingly fair minded film.
THIRTEEN DAYS is recommendable and good in spots, it just should have been better.",7,0,0,30 January 2001
Tarzan," Great animation...So-so story
","The animation has the Disney magic, the awesome technological and artistic talent we've come to expect for decades. Yet, with such an oft told story, it comes off as lame as your standard 'knock-knock joke' fare.     Truly, bringing to life a story that's been around for a hundred years or so; takes a bit of a trick to breathe new life into. After all, the popular novel and its sequels. The cartoon strip, the endless series of motion pictures (silent and sound, black and white and color), the tv series...on and on. If anyone could pull it off, one would think the Disney studios could. Well, '...there is no joy in Mudville...', folks.
    The environmental message, the easy going charm, the finely tuned expressions of the characters are all there...just nothing really new. The hidden ('wink-wink') humor to entertain the parents, which usually rescues adults from groaning through 2 hours of the normal kiddie fare, is also sorely lacking. The music did help, and was one of the picture's highlights. Unfortunately, that weighed against the predictability of the plot, the inaneness of some of the characters and the last second resolution of the differences between Tarzan and his adopted father really dull the senses.
    These are the kind of issues that separate great movies from the average.",7,1,2,5 February 2000
Gladiator," GIVE THEM 'BREAD AND CIRCUS'
","Rome, just like any other empire (British, Soviet and American, etc.), was bent as seeing itself as enlightening a dark world, even if attained by savage conquering. Therefore, historically speaking, it's hard to see these folks as the proverbial 'good guys' in some kind of morality play.
That said, director Ridley Scott does deliver to us a pretty good movie. I found the performances adequate, yet still couldn't help see Russell Crowe's character (Maximus) as the L.A. CONFIDENTIAL detective character suited up in armor. The same brooding performance. Maximus, for a Roman General, is the typical Hollywood antihero. (Hey...let's mow these Huns down, so I can call it a day, and get home to the wife and kid.) This is hardly original. I've seen better work of his, in such films as the mentioned L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, THE SUM OF US and ROMPER STOMPER. His main antogonist, is the emperor's son, Commodus, played bewilderingly off-the-box by Joaquin Phoenix. The guy is a walking-talking Freudian slip, whom anyone with an ounce of sense wouldn't let him watch a hardware store for an afternoon, let alone an empire. The contrasts between the two leading characters was simply too obvious and simplistic. I frankly saw too much of a parallel in the script, with the relationship of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus, Commodus and Lucilla. It was like this part was lifted from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. It reminded me of the old Red Skelton quip: 'Impersonation isn't the sincerest form of flattery...it's plagiarism!' Well, not as bad as all that, but the screenplay was hardly original, as well.   A nice touch, was adding a few older veteran actors (namely Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed, who gives an excellent turn to his character 'PROXIMO'). The battle scenes and the brutal gladiator fights were stunning in their horrible brutality. Serious kudos for not flinching about the awful truths of human carnage. Top marks in this catagory. The computer generated effects have been well mentioned for their disapointing results, by other reviews, so I need not mention them here. Overall, rather overrated, but still generally entertaining fare if you're not looking for something too deep. A classic on the level of SPARTACUS? Hardly.",7,0,0,25 July 2000
