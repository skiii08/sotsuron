Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wasted potential
","I hate to be negative about a movie I have waited impatiently towards for over  half of my life, but... it really wasn't very good. Visually, Phantom Menace was stunning, but there is more to a good movie than special effects. The original Star Wars and its two sequels could stand more or less by themselves as complete stories with developed characters and a coherent and interesting plot. And while there were open questions and loose ends, even after Empire Strikes Back there was some feeling of closure.Not this time. The characters are cardboard cutouts. If you didn't know who they were to become, you would have no idea who Yoda, Obi-Wan and others really were. And the two most interesting characters were killed off far too soon in the series. Why did Darth Maul get less screen time and character development than Boba Fet? I wanted to know where he came from, how he joined the future Emperor, why he looked like that, etc. All he got was about three lines of dialogue, a lot of grimacing and angry pacing, a cool saber fight, and the exit. ('Thanks for coming, Maul! Good luck in your death metal career!') What a waste of potential! But I'm sure all the merchandise with his likeness will fly off the shelves.Most annoying were Jar Jar Binks and his people. These quasi-Jamaican-sounding jabbering bafoons were even worse than the Ewoks. JJ reminded me of Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) from Gone with the Wind; a stupid clumsy native who must be continually saved by the wise caucasian. And what's with the fart jokes and repeated pratfalls?  If that's all the horse-faced amphibians are good for, Lucas should put them back in a disney animated kiddie fest where they belong and give us some real characters. But, of course, real characters might not be as popular come Christmas time.I really did want this movie to be great. I've been waiting for it for almost 20 years when me and my Star Wars-crazed friends first heard rumors that eventually there would be 9 movies in all. But I honestly can't make myself say that I liked Phantom Menace much at all. Of course, I'll be in line again for Episode 2 with renewed high expectations...",6,0,1,23 May 1999
