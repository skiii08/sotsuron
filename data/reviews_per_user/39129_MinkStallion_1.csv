The Expendables 2," Short and Sweet Reviews You Can Relate To
","Will You Regret Shelling Out?: Not if you are an 80's child growing up with these superstars of old-action.As my action/acting rating compares to Rambo III (Stallone): Spot On As my action/acting rating compares to The Transporter (Statham): Close As my action/acting rating compares to Commando (Schwarzenegger): Almost There As my action/acting rating compares to Universal Soldier (Lundgren and Van Damme) Spot OnWhy I Liked It: 15 minutes of actual dialogue, 88 minutes of mind blowing action. Why I hated It: It's hard to watch my favorite action superstars from the 80's looking so old on screen, this doesn't diminish anything from the film in my opinion, it's just hard to see them that way. It's amazing however, and I must complement them on their athleticism, that they can still be so amazing at making an awesome cheesy action film.",7,2,5,25 August 2012
