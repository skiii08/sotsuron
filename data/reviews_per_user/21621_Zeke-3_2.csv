The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the hype!
","There has been a lot of hype concerning this movie, and much of it undeserved.  While it's main selling point is that it's not what you see that scares you, it's what you don't. That part is true. It scares me that this movie has been hailed as 'The scariest movie ever made' or 'A true must-see'.  If you do see it, see it either at a matinee or a second-run theater...better yet, wait for the video. There were a few, and I do mean few, 'entertaining' parts of this movie. Mainly the interaction between the three characters when they finally realize their situation.  I admire the fact that it was unscripted and unrehearsed, but I feel this would have made a much better 'X-files' episode. Overall...cool concept.  Poor execution.",4,0,2,31 July 1999
American Beauty," How do you describe something like this?
","The best way I can sum up this movie is, 'Damn - That's f***ed up!' The opening narrative gives away the eventual ending of the film, but, you don't know the how's or why's.  Kevin Spacey has given yet another fantastic performance, Annette Benning's acting is right on target.  I almost didn't recognize Thora Birch, who gives a very 'surprising' performance - Man did she grow up or what?There are quite a few twists and turns, and just when you thing you've got things figured out - you're proven WAY wrong. Things aren't always what they seem to be.  What's wrong with the well-dressed, mild mannered drug dealer next door, what's up with his 'ex-marine colonel' father and his 'lost-in-her-own-inner-space' wife?  How do the gay neighbours figure in the equation?  And how does 'Smiley Burger' fit in?Pay attention to the dialogue, and body-language of all the actors - 'many clues will you uncover grasshopper.' 'Look closer'You may figure this one out before the ending, but you will still enjoy the ride.One final note, I bet the floral bill was enormous.  Definatly go see this movie, in fact, go see a few times - it's worth it.",10,0,0,25 September 1999
