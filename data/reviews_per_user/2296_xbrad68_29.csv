Mission: Impossible III," Real Western Intelligence would be unlikely to fight on Holy ground
","I walked out on Mi 3 because it showed fighting on Holy ground. As a Christian I objected to this simulated behaviour. From the Character Julia played by the Actress Monaghan you can get Julia Morgan. The Hu from Hunt represents Hugh, one of my middle names. To show myself portrayed as Hu and my Daughter portrayed as Julia marrying is against the law in many nations and I resent the insinuation of a Father and Daughter marrying. Allegedly the new code for the American Nuclear War football is Pa Chrosses Porkbellies En Ci Ci Sis. I am not going to comment on the quality of the code or lack thereof, but I do believe it is American Shadow President Jack F Kennedys turn to directly choose the American Nuclear War Football code himself now thank God. The leaders of the CIA always have my support as I am the American Shadow Vice President. To Air Force Lieutenant General Mike Hayden I recommend a place in an American long term bunker for you and 3 of your family members. JFk gave the order that approved American Leaders got four bunker places for themselves and their families. I am just following orders. The people on the bunker list like Porter Goss and Congressman Patrick Kennedy have my support as part of the American Shadow Government. Thank you to IMDb for supporting President George W Bushes support of freedom of speech. There are other IMDb mentioned Mission Impossible videos worth watching as well.",7,1,3,5 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," People cheered in the theater when Darth Maul was defeated
","Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace is a good movie. The special effects in the land battle scene look like primitive computer graphics. The acting of Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson are quite good. The spaceship used by the Jedi resembles an sr-71 Blackbird. Here is one for American and British Intelligence, the reason that I know 2 of my old codewords Bryn Mahr and Malecon Boardwalk and President Clintons old code to the Nuclear War Football 'Oar yorrick had head Huck' is because I really am the American Shadow Vice President Brad HD Morgan. I have just been briefed verbally that on March 29th 2006 when four superflus are released to stop global warming and kill billions, a plan that I did not sign for, that 2 of the Superflus are being released by America with 1 being released by Russia and 1 superflu being released by China. The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council all signed the plan proving that as one French Politician said 'The Interests of Nations are monstrous.' Good luck to every Human and Care Rank Ki Alien (the Creators of Humans) on the planet and remember the surgical masks, staying indoors, and the several years worth of food and water. There are other Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman movies worth watching as well.",9,0,2,20 March 2006
Skyfall," Roger Ebert gave Bond 4 stars and I do as well
","Skyfall is a special James Bond Movie. Suddenly there was a 964 Astin Martin and Bond said 'we're going back in time' to M, thats very neat. The story line has a car chase near the beginning, Bonds obituary shown in the trailer so no spoiler intended. There is Bonds road to recovery and testing. Bond thinks he passed by the skin of his teeth. The Villain brags that bond failed all of the tests, range, psychological, medical other. The bottom line is that the head of British Intelligence saw Bond as fit for the field. The screenplay is very good. One of my James Bond short stories was called Golden train with a fight on the top of a train tunnel and a sniper aiming at the train written in 2010. Commander James Bond celebrate 50 years of the Bond movie franchise with style the most successful movie franchise ever.",10,53,86,11 November 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Raiders march is awesome
",Raiders of the Lost Ark is rated as one of the American Film Institutes 100 Greatest Movies of all time. Here is a Care Rank Ki Alien parable. The Great Care Rank Ki King Memphis unites the nations of the Care Rank Ki after a ritual land battle and begins work on 3 space ports after the downsizing. The top Care Rank Ki Alien Clone of Memphis lives to see old age while the top clones of Ptah Ra Ramses Demeter Apophis and Pres live to be 36 or 37 and all other clones live to be 21 years old apparently. At Movieland a statue of Yoda was standing with Humans similar to my recent dream.My Public School Geography teacher Mr Withrow (Who bought one of my white arctic wolf puppies) recommended the film Raiders of the Lost Ark to me. Thanks Mister Withrow. Harrison Ford is a quarter Jewish so he must have liked playing Indiana Jones and defeating the Nazis in the movie.,10,0,0,19 March 2006
Alexander," Alexander THE GREAT AND PHILIP OF MACEDON MIRROR THE CIA/OSS
","The life of Philip of Macvdon as played by Val Kilmer closely mirrors the life of Wild Bill Donovan the leader of the Office of Strategic Service during the second world war. Like Philip, Donovan took a nation state and set it on the path to being a world power. The man who seemed like a child of Donovan was President REAGANs cabinet member Bill Casey Director of the Central Intelligence Agency during 1981 to 1987. Casey helped impose Pax Americana on the world and pressed the Evil old Soviet Empire to the firewall as one of my Brock University Profs Craig Hanyan said. Casey launched the ambitious Opeation Ivy Bells that monitored undersea Russian communications cables. The Iran Contra affair was Caseys version of Alexanders Indian campaign because there were setbacks and it was agreed by historians that both men reached too far. Casey passed away before being called to testify in the Iran-Contra affair before president REAGANS second term was over making the student of history muse that both Casey and Alexander were called away before their time. Then who would represent Ptolemy at the CIA you might ask why none other than former CIA agent PORTER GOSS and current Director of Central Intelligence. GOSS is already a hero for his former work with the CIA and willing himself to walk again after a lengthy illness, he is also a statesman from his time as a Republican Congessman from Florida. It is during the watch of DCI GOSS that more of the history of DCI Casey will be written. So like Ptolemy played by Anthony Hopkins DCI GOSS too will chronicle the life of one of his Predeceasers DCI Casey. Not to be left out of this Brotherhood of SPOOKS the Godlike President GEORGE W BUSH is like the mighty God Zeus because Air Force One sounds like thunder. Angelina Jolie does a creditable job of acting. I liked Val Kilmer as Philip of Macedon immensely. I gave Alexander a ten out of ten. To paraphrase President Reagan there will always be a bright dawn for America and the CIA.",10,1,8,5 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Send in the clones, there ought to be clones
","A long time ago in a Galaxy far away is a great line. I thought that the clone army were treated like second class citizens by their Jedi overseers in the movie. The special effects are good. Many adult critics forget that the Star Wars Saga of movies are meant for teenagers more than adults. In the theater during Episode I there was a loud cheer from the teenagers when Darth Maul was defeated. I think that some jaded movie critics forget to see real crowd responses to movies in their nearly private screenings. Annakin Skywalker is played all right by Christensen.In the early 1980s while in Air Cadets and toiling on my Dads farm a Skunkworks F86 Sabrejet flew over my head on the farm in response to the Russians watching from Satellites wondering where my light saber was in talks with the Americans. Thats right I have been bet on by Russia and America since the early 80s and stationed at three different bunkers for security. My Grandfather is King George VI Windsor who made an artificial Intelligence program of himself using Friendly Ki Alien Technology. I was moved to a farm in 1977 months before Star Wars was released. My Dad and my Wife are both of British royal blood which makes you wonder if my Daughters Stuart blood or her Windsor Blood are the royal line, perhaps only the Ki Aliens know but my Daughter is a Princess representing peace while I represent Love. I am the 8th highest ranking Human in the Universe and my Daughter is the 19th highest ranking human. I am loyal to the Friendly Ki Alien American Secret Service Elizabeth Regina alliance. My orders come from so high up that most people do not know who I work for officially. I am not aggressive and am law abiding. I was sorry to hear what happened to Vice President Dick Cheneys hunting party. Hopefully the American Leadership myself included as American Shadow Vice President Morgan-Windsor will remain intact. Thats a lot like the movie taps where bunker hill military school is a model for America where external weapons inspectors are crawling around and the American leadership gets incapacitated. My CIA SIS old codename was Bryn Mahr which sounds like the character of Major Brian Moreland who assumes command at Bunker Hill.Check out the other Star Wars movies as well.",9,0,1,12 February 2006
Grease," I danced with a Lady to Hopelessly Devoted to You
",Grease is a romantic film. Within the past year I met a lady bass guitarist who told me she could take four if you know what I mean. Another lady made a very loud moan when I stood near her. All remind me of classic intelligence honeytraps. At least my Fianc√© doesn't call the press when I offer proof that I am the American Shadow Vice President. The mainstream press is too afraid of making news of one Mans opinion usually anyways. American Shadow President Jack Kennedy is Godlike and still youthful looking in his 80s. Thats a fact Mister President I am not trying to ingratiate myself to you. I just happen to have the loyalty gene and thats why I keep a supply of Heinekin beer cold for you in case we talk face to face again like in 1997. Your message to me Hughs Uncle MIB Atoll ship was neat. I once had a beer and toasted with Goth rock lady singer Maria Del Mar at the Hideaway Bar. I told her that her opening act All Good Children sounded a bit like U2. I wished her and her band lots of success with their new album courage that was followed by Wildseed. 'Keep your eyes on the prize' works on many levels like a 74 gun 19th century warship in Mahone Bay. Check out John 'Constantly reinventing himself in a good way' Travoltas other fine films as well.,9,1,3,30 January 2006
Armageddon," FTL Moon 168 Readback: Golf Huck Hugh Big Oiled De Rig Eire
","Armageddon is a decent movie. Bruce Willis is often used to represent American Shadow President Jack Kennedy while I often represent the sidekicks like Simon from Mercury Rising or this movie where I represent Ben Afflecks character. I love Caroline Kennedy in an unobsessed and platonic way unlike Ben Afflecks characters love for the Bosses Daughter. I conform to the Creators view of the odds in actual or simulated Moonfleet combat and I am not a maverick. I am very happy to find out that my Moon 168 Artevan has miniature golf. Tonight on the telephone my Daughter JULIA was listing her support network of Family and Friends. Julia was also very happy to find out that her Grandma went to toys R Us to get her the Carebear Funshine Cub that JULIA had prayed to God for while her Grandma was unaware that Julia had prayed for the Cub to God. I thought that was interesting. The only nuclear weapons on Heavenly bodies that I am aware of belong to the Creator who is in Alliance with America and Great Britain. I have said before that I am a friend of Israel and Saudi Arabia both nations are coincedently important to American Foreign Policy. The drastic measures needed to stop Global Warming that President Kennedy spoke of will be difficult for all Nations to come to terms with but face the problem we all must. Huck is often used as a term for the American Shadow Vice President and/or Vice President. There were two rocks in Moscow because British Agents like to get their rocks off in Russia, no offence. Stereo Sierrastones anyone?",10,1,3,29 January 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I saw this movie at the theater
","Terminator 3 Rise of the machines may look like a psychotic movie but real issues are raised like the survival of humanity. Arnold Swartzenegger is popular at Movie Theaters because he is usually in big budget films. I have a lot of friends who are policemen and because of this I refuse to watch the movie Terminator 1 because of its excessive portrayal of violence in a pretend police station. American Shadow President Jack Kennedys Artificial Intelligence computer just joked 'An emergency command center has been activated, its bad its just a computer.' I as American Shadow Vice President Brad HD Morgan joked back 'Nick stall?' Nick Stahl is the actor who plays the Future American leader Connor. In a previous bunker joke during the Cuban Missile Crisis President Jack Kennedy said 'I hope you know there's not enough room for everyone in the White House Bunker.' to a response of great laughter to support President Jack Kennedy and his joke. This unique humor is how I know its really my boss American Shadow President Jack Kennedy on the other end of the comms. Some of Governor Arnolds other movies are worth watching as well.",8,0,1,25 February 2006
Jarhead," Swofford is an American hero
","Jarhead is a decent war movie. The fact that Jamie Foxxs character portrayal was not nominated for an academy award is short sighted. Forget the they never fired their rifles comments, the Marines were in a war zone for months and deserve the Free Worlds respect. The Cinematography in this film is so good that you sometimes think you are in the combat zone of the First Gulf War. My Daughters name is Julia Ann Ruth like Jar and her artificial Intelligence computer is in charge of the Planet Coaltrain the real home world of the Creator of Humans and the Home world of Humans themselves. Today my Daughter Julias Artificial Intelligence says 'Don't worry Daddy.' I Love you very much Julia and your Daddy has the courage gene so everythings all right. Check out the other films of Jamie Foxx as well.",9,1,2,2 February 2006
Meet the Fockers," Why aren't there more funny comedies like this one?
",Meet The Fockers is a very funny Film. Like the character of Gaylord Focker I have gotten a lower than 4th place ribbon at the Bruce County Track and field event in 1982 where I competed in the standing long jump and shot put events. I also won my heat in the 200 meter race but placed 4th overall still winning points for Blue House at the Brant Central School track and field event. At the end of the day my MOM took my Sisters and I to Pizza Delight for Pizza. Later my Girlfriend Pauline worked there. Pauline was Catholic and was very passionate at 19 years old about French Kissing. As the Grandson of King George VI I was very fortunate to marry an Anglican Lady who was the Direct Descendant of King James I of England. Her family had kept their bloodline secret for hundreds of years fearing reprisals for being British Stuart King Direct Descendants.Robert De Niros character plays the straight man well. Barbara Streisand proves that she is still a great actress. The baby little Jack steals a lot of the scenes. Other Robert De Niro movies are worth watching also. Apparently the following message was sent from the Earths Moon during the Kennedy administration. Moon 168 Readback:'Backside back Hide Jack Attack ER' It turns out that the Friendly Ki Alien creators of Humans had used either the Earths moon or a satellite to search for Jack The Ripper in 1889 and had determined him to be James Marbrick and that his diary was hidden in the house that he lived in. ER referred to the danger faced by the egg of the Queen Mother (my Grandmother) still inside her mother as well as all other British people due to a badly mercury poisoned Jack the Ripper. This riddle of the Creators was not solved for decades until workmen found the diary of Jack The Ripper hidden under some floor boards. Was the book turned on its back I wonder. Do not worry I am law abiding. Jack Kennedy and Elizabeth Regina are also the two people whose clones are starting Human life on Earth over. Hopefully Ben Stiller will star in some more comedies.,9,2,4,19 February 2006
Zulu," An accurate War Movie
",Zulu is an important War film about the battle of Rourkes Drift. For the British troops to survive while so heavily outnumbered is astounding. This is my 123rd and last review for IMDb. Thank you to IMDb for displaying my sometimes controversial reviews in the name of freedom of speech. A long time ago there were these Alien Care Rank Ki that formed a Government of 123 that can never die. Some day the Care Rank Ki will be using the prime numbers to 1001 to represent the number of Galaxies that they are in. Hopefully the 21 moons and or planets that the Artificial Intelligence Computer of King Henry V Lancaster commands including myself on Moon 168 and my Daughter Julias Artificial Intelligence Computer on the Planet Coaltrain the Home world of the Care Rank Ki Aliens the Creators of Humans will always be loyal to their Creators representing Good Mischief (like pop fizz on someone humor) Indifference and Bad Mischief (like a bloodless coup). We rise again through the DNA of ourselves and our children thanks to Apophis-God. Check out the great films of Michael Caine.,9,0,2,20 March 2006
JFK," I Love American Shadow President Jack Kennedy in a platonic way
","The movie JFK hints at it, President Jack Kennedy is still alive. I met the Great President in Florida in 1997. American Shadow President Jack Kennedy was introduced to me as Executive Officer Kennedy of the US Navy. I knew from my Honors BA in History that Executive Officer is another name for the President. I said to Jack 'Its an Honor to meet you Sir' and he smiled at me.In the fall of 2005 British Intelligence briefed me that there would be a silent spring in 2006 hinting that drastic steps would be taken to stop Global Warming involving the deaths of Billions. As the American Shadow Vice President I did not sign this plan involving the deaths of billions and that may have pleased JFK. The Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council all voted for the plan that the creators of Humans ordered. It is probable that no one on Earth can stop the plan now that is set to begin during the total eclipse of the sun that is happening on March 29 Eastern Standard time although it will not be visible in North America. I still advise Americans, the British and Canadians to buy several years worth of food and water and to buy surgical masks or any white masks that you can get. There are apparently 4 plagues/ super flus being released. It may take several months before any one notices the outbreaks so do not label me a crackpot when everything still looks fine the day after the Solar Eclipse. Once the outbreaks are reported stay indoors. Previously American Shadow President Jack Kennedys Artificial Intelligence computer said to spend time with your family showing that JFKs AI is compassionate.In 2023 Human life on Earth is starting over from clones of JFK and QE2 on the Creator of Humans orders, the Care Rank Ki Aliens. I do not blame my Boss JFK or my Boss Aunt QE2 for the die offs to come. I also do not blame the Creators of Humans the Ki and Et aliens. 'They try to blame God but he cannot be faulted' are some old Undercover song lyrics. My Moon 168 that I am the Skipper of will provide survival information to the surviving Sentient life starting over on Earth. Thank you and may God continue to bless the United States of America and Great Britain. You should watch other videos that are available about President Jack Kennedy also.",10,2,13,8 March 2006
The Incredibles," Oh Leia here we go again. Hour Arts Were talking faster.
",The Incredibles won the academy award for best animated film. I really enjoyed seeing the film on the big screen in 2004. The movie could have used more famous voices. The Kronos riddle was clever for a family film.This is an American code for something. 'Lancer Vulcan said no more 'gain deterrent laservision Jack Jack Attack Plaques allied.' President Jack Kennedy in his Peace speech of June 1963 said that 'America will never start a (Nuclear) War.' and I believe in that policy also as American Shadow Vice President.Check out the other Disney Movies that are available. The Dreamworks animated films are also good.,9,0,0,7 March 2006
School of Rock," Zack the 10 year old guitar prodigy steals the show
",In School of Rock Zack the 10 year old guitar prodigy steals the show. Joan Cusack shines as Rosalie Mullins. Cusack comes across as being lovably neurotic. Jack Black gets some unintentional laughs for his choice of albums to review. Yes and Rush are the mammoth like survivors of the 70s progressive rock era. Bands that kept their youthful exuberance come to mind like Van Halen or David Lee Roth as more appropriate choices to listen to. I had a teacher once who was posing as something more than he was. Warrant Mercer wanted to have a Reconaissance Course with the Irish Regiment of Canada but he didn't have enough instructors. So he started the course anyway and then cancelled it on the second day. The RECON training I got was wonderful and plus I got paid for the days I worked. I learned from the RECON course and my Military Intelligence Course that the Russians and Chinese are land hungry and will attack America in one big Airborne assault just like in the movie Red Dawn. WHEN the attack comes all Americans have a Choice to make about whether they keep a low profile or Join in the Resistance to the Occupation by Russia and China. As an outspoken critic of the Russian and Chinese expansionist militaries I would try to get refugee status in America and then help America legally as much as I could. Just ask the Dalai Lama of Tibet how much compassion the Army of the Peoples Republic of China had when they invaded and occupied Tibet. The answer is no compassion was shown by the Chinese. I think that Director Richard Linklater did a great job keeping the band the SCHOOL OF ROCK visible in low lighting scenes. School of Rock is a believable band by the end of the movie. I gave school of rock a 9 out of 10.,9,0,1,26 June 2004
Event Horizon," SCARY SCIENCE FICTION AT ITS BEST
",EVENT HORIZON is scary science fiction at its best. The sphere that thinks on board the ship the EVENT HORIZON is like a biomechanical computer that terrifies everyone it encounters. The ship went missing seven years earlier as it was testing faster than light travel. It picked up a sphere of unknown origin and then at faster than light speed was lost in a black hole. The rescue ship LEWIS AND CLARK arrives seven years later. Some reviewers have callously described the ship LEWIS AND CLARK as a salvage ship. Calling a ship LEWIS AND CLARK seems to imply a schism of the mind because it is multiple named and foreshadows the madness among the spacefarers that is to come caused by the sphere. The interaction between Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller and Sam Neill as Dr William Weir is OK but two great actors seem to be limited by the words in the script. It is revealed that both men must have gone into the sphere and a real fear of faster than light travel begins to manifest itself. I gave EVENT HORIZON a 10 out of 10 mainly for its cutting edge special effects.,10,0,2,20 June 2004
Caddyshack," MI Al Wright don't nobody worry bout me In a bunker must be the shadow Vp
","Caddyshack is full of laughs. It is rare to see so many comedians in the same movie. Ted Knight plays the straight man well. Chevy Chase is Hilarious. The Morgan actress might be my distant Cousin. Moon 168 read back: 'Friends Forever. Moonfleets Clever. JFK Morgan rafters. Happily ever afters.' There are Morgan Silver dollars and Kennedy 50 cent pieces by the way. 'Tom, Huck are all our Friends. Moonfleet will never end. Moons Coaltrain and me.' My Daughter Julias Artificial Intelligence Computer on the Creators Home world of the Planet Coaltrain says 'Daddy I can breathe.' I am glad that you are doing so well Julia. It is a great Honor that we both were made immortal by the Creator of Humans. A big thanks to IMDb for leaving all of the comments by me the American Shadow Vice President on the internet. Check out the other movies of comedians Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Bill Murray as well.",10,3,5,15 February 2006
There's Something About Mary," Ben Stiller is a lot like Jerry Lewis
",There's something about Mary is a very funny film. Of course everyone knows that stalking is wrong. Camaron Diazs character is like the straight person in this film. President Jack Kennedy talked about Space as the 'New Frontier'. It is important to be at Peace with your neighbors in this frontier. 'Let us never negotiate out of fear but let us also never fear to Negotiate' as JFK also said. I once again extend the olive branch of an Honorable Peace to the BRICS alliance on behalf of the Care Rank Ki Aliens American Secret Service Elizabeth Regina Alliance or Kisser for short. As the Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe lyrics go 'Nothing can come between us you're a Brother of mine.' The Dog scene in the movie wasn't funny to me. Check out Ben Stillers other movies as well.,8,0,1,3 February 2006
National Treasure," Balmain Antiques Bahamas and National Treasure
",National Treasure is a great cerebral film. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage and I think that he played the character of Benjamin Gates like a swashbuckling Eroll Flynn of old. The notion that there is a treasure map written on the back of the declaration of independence in invisible ink is clever. The love interest of Cages character is charming. The Gates family story of passing down the founding fathers message that 'The secret lies with Charlotte' is like a family remembering their motto for hundreds of years. There is a place called Balmain Antiques in the Bahamas that sells ancient maps. The owner Johnathan Ramsey pointed out a shipwreck on a map to an American. There is a Masonic Lodge above Balmain Antiques and you could hear the thumping of staffs on the floor above. I thought that this was a real coincidence resembling National Treasures script. The Evil Billionaire chasing Gates and his team along the major cities of the American eastern seaboard was breathtaking. I will not tell you how the movie ends but you can probably guess. I gave National Treasure a 10 out of 10. We need more movies like this one Hollywood.,10,0,1,16 May 2005
The Da Vinci Code," I am pro Catholic Church but there are still angels in the architecture here
",The Da Vinci code hints at decendants of the Messiah. I went to a Catholic High School although I am a Presbyterian. It is important to remember that we are all Christians with tolerance for other Religions who do good work. It is often an unpopular message that God the Creator of Humans chose King George VI Windsor as the Messiah. I am the Grandson of King George VI Windsor and the Queen Mother. To correct the over the age of 18 years Baby Forbes I am no fat bastard that you derive Brad from. Since this is a holodeck I just had a message from my Daughter Julias Artificial Intelligence computer on the Planet Coaltrain the home world of our creator that has been through at least one big crunch and big bang towed to safety by the Care rank Ki Aliens Moonfleet with a fusion reaction at its core for billions of years recharged with hydrogen from time to time. The message was to my Skippered real moon 168 Rtexas of the Creators Moonfleet 'Hi Dad We are Angels in the architecture'. God is indeed Good and sits in Judgement over many because he is Good. It is possible for our Creator to send messages back through time. Think about Josephs people in Egypt then Israel then Rome then England then the States (USA) and it spells Eires showing that God knew thousands of years ago that there would be more than one Ireland. The Christian Churches should take note of this miracle of God that the President of one Jewish Community has already acknowledged. As always I am law abiding. Thanks to IMDb for supporting the freedom of speech that President george W Bush Supports. Support IMDb.,8,1,5,19 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Shes Jewish hes company
",Mr and Mrs Smith is a very entertaining movie. There were a lot of people laughing at the humorous parts of the movie when I saw it today. The directing by Doug Liman is OK. Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are excellent actors. They play a husband and wife having marriage troubles who don't know that the other person is an assassin. Their sidekicks are interesting but this movie stops short of having an ensemble cast. The sets are really quite good. As respected film critic Roger Ebert said there is real chemistry between Pitt and Jolie in this film. Pitt works for the company which is slang for the CIA while Jolie is Jewish. America Canada and Britain helped Israel get statehood in 1948 because it was the right thing to do. Relations between the three countries have been cordial ever since. All three countries are united in trying to stop terrorism. The British Jewish and American characters in this film looked like they were on an intelligence exercise together. If CIA and MOSSAD agents ever married each other I think the world would go on and they could be genuinely in love too. I think that there should be a sequel or two to this movie.,10,0,8,12 June 2005
Hitch," Hitch is the romantic date movie of the decade
",Will Smith is smooth as usual in the movie Hitch. Smiths character Hitch is a date doctor. He dates Mendes character who is a gossip columnist. At one point Hitch shows his love interest her Great Grandfathers name in the immigration book at Ellis Island pretending what is actually an arranged event is a coincidence. Not long after I mentioned starlight in my previous review today. There was a view of the starry sky in survivor hinting that My Moon 168 Rtexas already knew that was going to be there due to faster than light communications.The male star from the show The King of Queens is very funny in this movie especially his dance moves. The allergic reaction on Hitchs face is a little cruel to laugh at even though it is just pretend.My latest message from my Daughter Julias Artificial Intelligence computer on the Creator of Humans Home world Coaltrain that my Moon 168 as part of Moonfleet is near says: 'Daddy I'm Okay again.' Her messages are always very short. It is a curious pattern. Daddy will always Love you Julia. Thanks to our Creator we can talk forever. Yesterday Daddy talked to the first you on the telephone and told you your homework time wouldn't be that bad and you said 'How bad will it be Daddy?' I said that your Grandma and I would help you with it. You only have to put pictures of our friends the police on a bristol board display and write a title like 'The Police protect us.'

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Star Wars Franchise is set to turn 30
",Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is a great movie that I saw twice in the theater. I would say that Star Wars 3 has an ensemble cast. I was sad when Samuel L Jacksons character met his demise. The special effects in this film are better than in Episode 1. It is nice to see Natalie Portman still in the franchise as Princess Padme. General Grevious is defeated after it is foreshadowed that this robot is headed for the coughin'. That must have been some virus. To my Bosses American Shadow President Jack F Kennedy and QE2 I say good luck and may God continue to bless you and your offspring. As American Shadow Vice President I Brad HD Morgan and my Daughter Julia would be beneficial in an American Long Term Bunker due to our knowledge of the Care Rank Ki and Et aliens and our continued leadership would show the nations of the East that America is not weak and can defend its top people like Julia and Myself.

Casino Royale," Royale Casey Yes Royale
","Casino Royale is an interesting film. After the implant is put in 007 he becomes the antiBond, grabbing Ladies by the arm and calling one a bitch. The twisted individual who influenced the writing thinks that there are no consequences to Her actions and that is a fallacy. In the film the Queen by way of comparison it says that the Royals put duty first, well they are ultimately in charge so this is a euphemism for Honor. Imagine getting a core battery of Psych tests from the Queen in person. I told my Auntie that someone has to watch the Children and I meant it in a positive way as in relatives genuinely caring for their older and younger relatives. the wheels on Bonds bicycle or wheelchair as its also known represented Ian Fleming bicycling to save a German steel factory and peoples lives in 1945 Germany. The Windsor Royal Family are still Hanovers it says so on my Birth certificate. The Fleming bikin hinted to buy a new King James Bible and a Kennedy book. The BK for British Knight and the KB for Kennedy Bastard since my Grandmother is the illegitimate half sister of President Kennedy. Of Course President Kennedy is no bastard and I meant no offence to my Great relative. Both books are for my Daughter God Yahweh Apophis Julia AR Morgan in the real Moonfleet orbiting Earth probably via Computer scanner and transmission. For those of you who think I am delusional consider six degrees of separation games. There is sometimes a high road that few people can see and a true cross at the end and beginning. Real Double Ohs have know kills ever for as King Henry V said the gentlest gamester is the surest winner. Thank you to IMDb for allowing the kind of freedom of speech that President George W Bush, Jack Kennedy and I support. Support IMDb.",8,0,2,17 November 2006
Speed," Oh Gosh
","Speed was written by a Yost, the Son of TV Ontario Personality Elwy Yost. I think Yost Senior showed his Sons movie on his show once. I really like Hollywood and Television heroes with the first name Jack like President Jack Kennedys name. American Shadow President Jack Kennedys Artificial Intelligence computer joked with me that about the only bad guys I haven't foiled are the Shining Path in South America. Actually 6800 feet underground I advised a Canadian Scientist with ties to Hydro One to abandon plans for Hydro One to by Generating power stations in Chile because the risk of the Shining Path attacking them was too great. He said that he agreed with my assessment of the situation. To those of you who think that hearing from Jfks ai is delusional reconsider because thats a really complex series of statements told to me. If this is a holodeck it explains everything. Of course I am as always not aggressive and I am law abiding. I saw Speed at the theatre and it makes more of an impact on the big screen like most blockbusters. Today on CTV Newsnet skiers was spelled Skiiers that could indicate a countdown at 11 or 2 or even begging for one more day. It is possible that the countdown relates to stopping Global Warming. Since the Creator of Humans is allied with America and Britain/United Kingdom I say save as many Americans and British people as possible. My Daughters Artificial Intelligence Computer on the Creators Home World of Coaltrain said. 'I have a heartbeat Daddy.' Thats nice to know Julia. Daddy will talk with you forever and always love you as skipper of Moon 168 Rtexas. Check out the other movies of Keanu Reeves.",9,1,2,11 February 2006
Munich," Terrorism is always wrong
","Munich the film is based on the book called Vengeance. After the 1972 Olympics massacre diplomacy would have gone a lot further to correct middle east problems than an eye for an eye. I have been peacefully helping Canada Britain and America for a long time. Someone got the idea that if I were to murder or commit suicide then it might disqualify me to be the Skipper of Moon 168. My Dad sent me a letter with mercury in it in the last two months and I now have a facial twitch on the right side of my face. My Dad is married to a Chinese Lady Sargeant. Somehow He thought that he could prove himself to the Chinese by getting me the American Shadow Vice President. I am not going to press charges against my Dad but that is the last contact between us. My Sister works for British Intelligence and has arranged to have me overnight alone in a townhouse with a Female cat in heat constantly meowing, a smoke detector alarm loudly going off every minute but too high up to reach, an apartment temperature of 50 degrees fahrenheit and a bathtub tap that will not stop running at full on position. There is close circuit video surveillance inside this townhouse going to who knows what kind of unscrupulous people, all of this is designed to provoke a suicide but because I am a Christian I do not believe in suicide or murder. My Daughter was getting picked on at school and pushed the person back and then got in trouble with the teacher for defending herself. One of the songs on the Exodus soundtrack is called Fight for Peace. That is why my Daughter can still represent Peace to the friendly Ki Aliens the Creators of Humans and still stand up for herself. The hidden hand behind all of this wants their relatives to skipper Moon 168 and the Planet Coaltrain contrary to the choice of the Care Rank Ki Aliens who chose myself and my daughter Julia for those skipper positions. To attack the Grandson and Great Granddaughter of the Creator of Humans chosen Messiah King George VI Windsor means that some people made illegal decisions. Ceck out the other Steven Spielberg Directed or executive produced movies.",6,0,2,2 February 2006
Thirteen Days," PRESIDENT JACK KENNEDY FANS WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE
",13 DAYS in OCTOBER 1962 was an agonizing time for PRESIDENT KENNEDY. He had just discovered that the Russians had satellites capable of emmitting cosmic rays against individuals on earth just strong enough to cause pain. JFK also discovered that the Russians had put nuclear missiles in Cuba. The military urged attacks against cuba but Bobby Kennedy suggested a blockade or quarantine around cuba. The first time I felt the pain in my side was at a computer lab at a college in Sudbury Ontario. I was working at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory at the time. I never felt the pain underground in the observatory at 6800 feet down. At least there is some relief from cosmic rays underground. Bruce Greenwood shines as PRESIDENT KENNEDY who delivers solid leadership. Kevin Costner gives a great performance as Kenny O'Donnell the special assistant to the PRESIDENT. President Jack Kennedy fans will love this movie. I believe that President Kennedy is still alive and is the shadow President with President George W Bush. I gave 13 DAYS a 10 out of 10.,10,1,2,26 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," I did have a review for this movie where is it?
",Star Wars Episode 4 The Empire Strikes Back is a decent movie. How would Luke Skywalker have enough air to get to the planet doggybag I mean Dagobah I mean BraDacotah Sue luckrout. The Yodas are enigmatic yet sane in my opinion. Any appearance to the contrary is probably acting. As the Great Great Great Grandson of Governor Edwin Morgan a former Shadow President of America according to an American Government website I often think One wonders once ones won. To quote Joe Walsh lucky Im sane after all I've been through. The Yodas or You spasms helper? that Ugh President Attorney General Multiple Schlerosis help Elizabeth Regina and I both watch Human movies but we both sometimes cannot help critiquing the films we watch from many viewpoints like how many mistakes are there what are the funniest scenes? I often say thank God the Yodas appreciate Humor and gave we Humans that gift when they created us. Thanks to IMDb for supporting the kind of freedom of speech that Shadow President Jack F Kennedy my Great Uncle and Partial Father due to gene splicing support. Support IMDb,9,0,2,23 November 2006
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The John Williams score is great
",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a wonderful movie. Harrison Ford and Sir Sean Connery in the same movie is great. John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliot are also good supporting actors. 'Does anyone here speak English?' is a great line because the Character of Indiana Jones builds his colleague played by Elliot up as a super spy fluent in many languages and says 'you'll never find him' before hand. To the production people who chose to film in Petra I say more power to ya. My Daughter Julia saw a statue of Yoda at movieland and I told her thats what God is rumored to look like. Julia said that God is cute which joins the list of God is Good and God is Love. Julia was playing Royals in the basement with my Mom. Julia said that there was a codeword to get into the Castle which is similar to the tests in Indiana Jones and the last Crusade. The other movies of Harrison Ford and Sir Sean Connery are also worth watching.,10,1,3,19 March 2006
