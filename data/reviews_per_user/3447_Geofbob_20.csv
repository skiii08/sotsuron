Antz," Hugely entertaining (and a lesson in civics)
","This is one animated movie that is just too good and clever to be left to the kids, though they will certainly be entertained by the imaginative characterisations, exciting storyline, funny sequences and expressive music. But in addition to these basic merits, adults will also enjoy the way the main CGI-produced characters have been adjusted to the actors providing the voices, rather than the other way round. This applies especially, of course, to Z (Woody Allen) who embodies not only Allen's neurosis, but that awkward, questioning individuality that so often goes along with neurosis; and which is particularly awkward for a worker-ant, supposed to conform to the totalitarian norm with every fibre of its being. With gentle-giant soldier-ant Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), autocratic General Mandible (Gene Hackman) and his smooth sidekick, Col Cutter (Christopher Walken), also, the personalities of the voicers - or at least of the human characters they often play - have been successfully incorporated into the animated figures. This aspect of the movie is perhaps not so marked with the female characters - the Queen (Ann Bancroft), Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) and Z's friend Azteca (Jennifer Lopez), which may be because actresses are less typecast in Hollywood movies than their male counterparts. A dominant feature of the film is its strong political message in favour of individual liberty and freedom of choice, a message which carries more weight because it is delivered not by some super-hero, but by arch-nebish Z. Yet despite this theme of the individual, the climactic image of the film is one of teamwork, with the ants voluntarily combining their strength and agility to save themselves and each other, by forming a precarious tower of bodies supported by the strong-limbed and even stronger-hearted Weaver.",Null,0,0,28 December 2001
G.I. Jane," Manipulative and sadistic freakshow
","It's a pity Demi Moore's great performance, and the overall high qualities of this production, are wasted on such an artificial and  nasty plot and subtext. Moore's portrayal of Lieut Jordan O'Neill putting herself through hell on a Navy SEAL training course, in order to convince military chiefs that women should be allowed on combat duties, may appear superficially to strengthen the argument for equal opportunities, but in reality undermines the case. The movie's message - expressed most forcefully when O'Neill shouts 'Suck my d**k!' at a tormentor -  is that to achieve equality women have to become men. The unspoken implication is that the vast majority of women (and men) would think this too high a price to pay, and therefore women will never achieve equality. However, before we the audience reach that conclusion, director Ridley Scott has set us up to sit through the sight of a group of men and a woman being literally and metaphorically dragged through the mud, culminating in O'Neill being beaten up by the Master Chief in charge of training, played all too convincingly by Viggo Mortensen. I don't object to the nastiness as such - we've seen the same or worse in many movies - but usually we're expected to be repulsed, whereas here our approval is sought. Had it contained any serious discussion of the real issues involved in putting women on the front line, there might have been some point to this movie. But as it is, it resembles a mindless fairground freakshow.",Null,2,5,28 December 2001
Unbreakable," Super natural directing
","Generally, I am no great fan of movies involving the occult or the supernatural, unless they are highly stylised like Nosferatu or the Indiana Jones films; so even classics like Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist tend to leave me cold (with scepticism, not horror). But I've found myself totally gripped by both The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, even though for the most part M Night Shyamalan avoids stylisation, and both movies are set firmly in the real world.For me, the key to Shyamalan's achievement in turning what might have been simply cult films into generally acclaimed successes has little to do with his handling of the supernatural or (in Unbreakable) comic book elements in his screenplays and directing, and has everything to do with his treatment of the characters and of the actors who play them. He successfully performs what should be a basic task of film-makers, but is so often disregarded - he makes us care about the characters. In other words, unlike most fantasy movies, his films are driven by character, not plot. In Unbreakable, by giving David Dunn (Bruce Willis) a down-to-earth job as a security guard, Shyamalan not only exploits Willis's total authenticity in such a role, he makes it easier for us sympathise with Dunn, as an ordinary working stiff whose marriage is on the rocks. At the same time, though he, by contrast, is rich and successful, we also sympathise with Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), not only because of his physical handicap, but because of his poor background, that the director has taken the trouble to show us. He uses the camera, too, to linger on the characters, allowing us time to listen to them, wonder about them, identify with them.
But this care with the characters does not mean that the plot of Unbreakable is neglected; on the contrary, it has one of the most original and ingenious plots of recent years. And unlike, for example, Being John Malkovich, the plot maintains its internal logic all the way through. I believe fans of the occult genre would be wrong to regard the movie's final twist as a cop-out. The ending in no way contradicts or erodes the supernatural element, but simply sets it more firmly in a real-world context. There has been talk of a sequel to Unbreakable, and this might be interesting; but personally I would like to see Shyamalan tackle a non-occult screenplay and movie, using to the full his ability with characters and human interest.",6,0,0,3 May 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," A fine film in its own right
","This is a beautifully-crafted, emotion-packed testament to the horrors of war and the power of love. Its accuracy as regards the actual WW2 occupation of Cephalonia by the Italians and Germans, and its fidelity to the novel on which it is based, are neither here nor there. As a movie, it is completely successful on its own terms, which are old fashioned enough to include a linear story line and straightforward characterisations and relationships.The central love story is a take on Romeo and Juliet, neatly fitting in with the fact that director, John Madden, made Shakespeare in Love, also based on a star-crossed lovers theme. The magnificent Cephalonian scenery also brings to mind ancient Greek drama, and its constant theme of man against the fates, so it may be significant that Madden also directed one of the episodes of a 1990 TV series on Greek Myths (with acknowledgements to IMDb!). But, since we're now in the sphere of  commercial cinema, not classical tragedy, the film has a happy ending, though this is muted and well judged in tone.Almost all the performances are thoroughly convincing, especially John Hurt as Dr Iannis, and Penelope Cruz as Pelagia. Nicolas Cage is also effective as Corelli, though his earnest passionate persona may not be sufficiently stereotypically Italian for some people's taste. Particularly believable is Christian Bale as Pelagia's brave, but insensitive, fianc√©, Mandras. The production values are high grade, including the music and effects. In particular, the battle and massacre scenes are graphically realistic and truly shocking.To sum up, this is an excellent movie, with much to admire, and very little to dislike.",Null,2,4,5 June 2001
The Fan," De Niro makes it all worthwhile (just)
","A flawed movie,  but worth seeing for De Niro's performance as Gil Renard, an increasingly crazed fan/stalker. Also, yet again, baseball shows itself as the sport most able to provide striking visual metaphors for the ups and downs of life (though, as a Brit, I've noted some of the specific criticisms aimed at the baseball sequences in this movie by IMDb commenters from the US).Where the movie, via the genius of De Niro, certainly succeeds is in convincingly demonstrating how easily and quickly obsessive devotion can turn to obsessive hatred, when the object of that devotion fails to meet the assumptions of the extreme fan. Certainly, there's some of Max Cady, the Cape Fear psychotic, in his portrayal; but there's also a lot of Rupert Pupkin, the confused kidnapper and would-be comic from King of Comedy - both films, of course, directed by Martin Scorsese.Where the film fails is in being too repetitive and, consequently, a bit too long; one or two of the scenes where Gil is trying to sell his knives are superfluous; and, when Gil is at the game with his son, why does the camera have to keep cutting to the woman in the crowd - once or twice would have been sufficient. Several of the scenes also seem derivative, especially those involving Dan Butler, as Garitty the sales manager, which echo Glengarry Glen Ross. A major unconvincing aspect is that surely a $40m signing, like Bobby Raybourn (Wesley Snipes), would be surrounded by a lot more razzmatazz than simply one not-too-effective agent (John Leguizamo).But, on the whole, one to rent or watch on TV (as I've just done) if nothing more compelling is available.",6,28,41,30 April 2001
12 Monkeys," A surreal masterpiece
","Until fairly recently Terry Gilliam's 1995 movie might have been viewed as unduly apocalyptic and pessimistic. But post-September 11, the film's vision of Armageddon (and oblivion for most of us), followed, for those that remain, by a beleaguered existence in a soul-less society dominated by technology, seems less a nightmarish prophecy and more a sober forecast.
Bruce Willis delivers a powerful performance as James Cole, a violent convict, time-transported back from about 2030 to the 1990s, in order to discover the precise origins of a virus which destroyed most of the world's population in 1996. Because of the time-shifts, the inclusion of some dream sequences, and the complexity of Gilliam's vast and detailed sets, the narrative isn't easy to follow initially, but it falls into place as it progresses towards an enigmatic close. Among the more conventional aspects of the film are glamour and love interest provided by Madeleine Stowe as a psychiatrist, a road sequence when Cole goes on the run, and a suspenseful ending. The director even plays with us at one point, leaving us guessing about the action, √† la Hitchcock. But intertwined with this main plot are other themes, especially that of the confusion between madness and sanity in an increasingly insane world. Central here is Brad Pitt - pouring out words and pointing his fingers like daggers - as Jeffrey Goines, the disturbed son of a world-famous scientist (Christopher Plummer) who is developing the fateful virus (for reasons I didn't catch, but which are probably just as valid as the USA's development of anthrax spores). Who is more mad - Jeffrey or his acclaimed father? The issues of ecology, consumerism and the dominance of the media are also touched on. Among various religious themes and references, it is probably not too fanciful to identify Cole as a Christ-figure - with appropriate initials - sent down to save the world, but whose warnings are as little heeded as those of the original.But despite the wealth of ideas in the movie, seeing it is above all an astonishing visual experience. Most of the images are bleak and disturbing - with little to choose between those set in the present day and those in the future - but they have a surreal beauty. The image of central Baltimore, deserted by humans, and taken over by animals is especially haunting.",Null,0,0,27 December 2001
Billy Elliot," Sheer magic
","Billy Elliott is a moving, uplifting, and often exuberant, drama about motherless young Billy (Jamie Bell) fulfilling his dream of becoming a ballet dancer, in the process overcoming the objections and prejudices of his father and brother (Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven).It is also a piece of magic realism, with political overtones. By setting their near fairy tale in the context of a close-knit mining community, and more specifically against the backdrop of the 1984/5 miners' strike - a defining moment of modern British economic and social history - writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry are able to refer to gender and class issues, without turning their work into a political tract, and without losing focus on the central human drama.The film is realised near flawlessly. Bell achieves a convincing blend of adolescent bewilderment and defiance; if his dancing is not quite as good as we might expect, the storyline explains this away by saying that at this early stage his attitude and drive are more important than his technique. The dancing set pieces, clearly inspired more by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly than by Nijinksky, are performed with gusto, mainly to pop songs by T-Rex.Lewis and Draven put gritty realism and passion into their roles of a father and son committed to their community and to the miners' cause. They make us feel their despair as they realise that this cause is lost; but also their endurance as they come to terms both with Billie's aspirations and their own uncertain futures - within a few years most UK coalmines would be closed. (The colliery in Easington, the real-life location of the film, closed in 1994.). The scenes of violence between strikers and police are presented uncompromisingly and authentically, but with the occasional touch of humour.Julie Walters provides an outstanding performance as Mrs Wilkinson, the dancing teacher who recognises and fosters Billie's talent; and helps him resist his own and his family's inhibitions. She is perfect as the chain-smoking, straight-talking mentor, who has her own personal disappointments and hurts, which she hopes Billie's success will help heal. To we outsiders watching the movie, Mrs Wilkinson appears as an integral part of the local community; but it is made clear that in the mid-80s, as far as Billie's family and friends are concerned, she is a middle class outsider, almost as alien as another species.One issue which the film tackles head-on is traditional heterosexual male abhorrence of homosexuality. This attitude clearly underlies the shock of Billie's father and brother when they discover his interest in ballet. They would be even more horrified if they realised that his best friend was discovering gay tendencies in himself. It is typical of the sensitive direction that without labouring the point the film indicates by its close that attitudes towards gays changed radically during the 1980s and 90s along with the industrial landscape.",9,74,77,22 December 2005
Match Point," London no match for New York
","It's a little odd that for the time being at least Woody Allen has transferred his affection from New York to my home town, London. Following Match Point, he's well into his second London film (Scoop), and a third is said to be on the stocks. The point is, he may love London, but it's not clear that London or the UK generally loves him. Yes, they adore the classics, like Annie Hall and Manhatten; but they were never keen on his 'Bergman period' efforts such as Interiors; and his latest offerings have generally been panned - I had to see and enjoy the bad taste of Hollywood Ending in Paris, as to date (late 2005) it's not been released in the UK.All the signs are that Match Point will be well received when it opens here early in 2006; but personally I wasn't too sure. (Again, I saw it in the French capital, which gets many English-language films before London, and whose cinema scene makes ours look provincial.) It seemed to me that Allen may have been mildly infected by whatever bug caused Robert Altman to make Gosford Park. His film is so, so English, with almost all the characters talking in posh accents, and living posh life-styles (apart from the stereotypically, cardboard police detectives); and if there was even one of Allens trade-mark wisecracks, I missed it.Sure, much of the milieu has to be high class, since a main theme of the film is how far a poorer (though not that poor) chap will go to climb the social ladder; but Allen might have shown a little of London's seamier and steamier side, to complement the series of shots of pristine tourist attractions such as the Tate Modern, South Bank arts complex, 'Gherkin' office block, and Notting Hill. Overall, the film struck me as rather stilted and lifeless; and if it's Hitchcockian, it's the Hitch of Dial M for Murder.Nevertheless, the film is deftly made and watchable, with more than a few surprises along the way, and all the principles filling their roles adequately, though I wasn't entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as femme fatale. Incidentally, one of the odder pieces of casting is the comedy actor and TV star, John Fortune, as the almost non-speaking chauffeur, though I note he is uncredited on IMDb.Needless to say, since it is Woody Allen, it's a 'must see' movie; but personally I hope for better from Scoop, and eventually would prefer to see him return to and do his work in the more familiar territory of Manhatten.",7,5,15,21 December 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," It's only a movie
","Some IMDb commenters are taking this movie way too seriously - it's a comedy for heaven's sake! Like many other best sellers, the book is no literary masterpiece, so it would be surprising if the movie was on the level of, say, Philadelphia Story.Yes, the film's sexual politics are hardly 'correct' - though many thirtyish women seem to find no difficulty in identifying with Bridget -and its portrait of Britain displays the usual Richard Curtis (sorry Sharon Maguire!) cozy stylisation - with almost all the faces as white as the inevitable snow. But Zelwegger, Firth and Grant are all excellent, and there are lots of laughs. In particular, high praise to Renee Zelwegger, who as well as having a near-perfect English accent, projects that mix of sexiness (though muted here) and vulnerability that makes her appealing to both male and female members of the audience. One specific criticism - the fight scene is a tad too savage and prolonged for a movie of this kind.",7,0,0,28 April 2001
Cast Away," Even Tom Hanks can't solve all problems
","What a time everyone would have, moaning about this movie if Tom Hanks weren't in it - too long; too thin; disjointed; inconclusive ending; longest product placement in the history of cinema! But because of his presence most of these criticisms fade away, and in any case the film probably wouldn't have been made without him. The majority of the audience, including me, are happy to watch Hanks, whatever he's doing on screen, because of his charisma and sheer acting ability.But there are some faults with this movie that Hanks cannot solve, and at least one where he must bear some responsibility. To start with the latter, I just don't think he does enough in the early scenes to make Chuck Noland the time-driven man that the movie needs to make its point that there is more to life than rushing around, watching the clock, and meeting deadlines. Yes, he's a busy, diligent executive, who possibly cares as much for FedEx as for his lover Kelly (Helen Hunt), but on a personal level he doesn't come over as particularly harrassed or obsessive; I don't really take him seriously when he's shouting at the Russian operatives. 
We must blame the producers and director, Robert Zemeckis, for other problems. A major one is that by omitting a proper rescue scene the movie misses an opportunity for dramatic action (and good-feel action to balance the all-too-realistic air-crash) and also cheats the audience of the release of emotion and tension it deserves after sticking with Chuck through his long ordeal. The cut from the moment of rescue to Noland a few weeks later flying home is too abrupt. Another complaint is that, though I have no quarrel with the ending as regards the plot, the locale where Bettina Peterson lives, which we've also seen at the beginning of the movie, is just too empty, flat and boring. I'm sure Zemickis had good reasons for  choosing this location, but he doesn't seem to have had the visual appearance of the movie much in mind. (If he simply wanted to convey remoteness, why not have her live in the mountains or deep in the everglades!)Hanks has now become a movie icon in a very literal sense - the audience enters a cinema where he is starring with much the same feeling of veneration as does the congregation entering a church. This near-idolatry is reinforced by the parts he plays - almost invariably men of charm, integrity, and in Cast Away courage, tenacity and resourcefulness. It would do both him and his fans good to play a less saintly role; and this may be the case in The Road to Perdition, now in production, where he's due to play a killer.",7,0,0,5 May 2001
Apocalypse Now," A masterpiece
","It is debatable whether or not Francis Ford Coppola succeeds in taking us to the 'heart of darkness' with this movie, but he certainly shows us, in unique, surreal and indelible images, the monstrosities and absurdities of war. Set pieces like the Wagnerian helicopter attack on a village, the jungle 'centrefold' concert, the sampan massacre, the defence of the bridge, and the scenes in Kurtz's temple compound all brilliantly illustrate how war blurs the distinctions between heroism and murder, sanity and madness, truth and myth. As Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) journeys up the river towards its source, towards the dark heart of Col Kurtz (Marlon Brando), he also journeys towards the source of  his own darkness. In finally confronting Kurtz, he confronts part of himself. He has the choice of taking Kurtz's place, and like Kurtz giving himself over entirely to darkness, to horror; of becoming one of the 'hollow men' of the T S Eliot poem Kurtz reads out. Or of leaving horror and the jungle behind -even if only temporarily - and travelling back down river. In choosing this latter course,  Willard chooses the possibility - no matter how remote - of  lightening his heart.     The film is probably best regarded as episodic,  rather than as a narrative. Indeed, it falters when it tries to tie its parts together tightly and logically, via Willard's voice-over. Likewise,  as important as Joseph Conrad's original story is for providing the main  theme and plot outline, it would have been better if Coppola had not followed it in certain details, particularly Conrad's hinting that Kurtz has gone over the edge because of the influence of 'primitive' rituals. As Coppola graphically demonstrates in the gunship and napalming sequences, 'advanced' people need no instruction in savage  practices from 'primitive' people. The performances are dominated by Robert Duvall's surfing-mad, napalm-loving Lt Col Gilmore; and by Brando, who convincingly conveys - sometimes simply by his silent presence - the complexity of the human mind and spirit. In my view, Dennis Hopper's naive and incoherent hippie photographer is given too much screen time. Sheen, apart from his dramatic scenes at the beginning and end of the film, generally plays a passive role, and his part seems under-written in the scenes on the boat - but this may be due to his sickness during the making of the movie. But the film belongs not to the actors but to Coppola, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, and the editors. From the first hypnotic whirrings and images of helicopters and a ceiling fan to the last mutterings by Sheen of 'horror', the movie sucks you into its bizarre world. Despite its flaws, this is a masterpiece of film making.",Null,0,0,9 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," A costly, artificial pearl
","Though it plumbs the depths of schoolboy heroics and slushy sentimentality, on its completion, the makers of Pearl Harbor probably considered it a successful achievement and $150m well spent. (What they think now, in view of subsequent US box-office disappointment, is another matter.) With their eyes and minds fixed on such forerunners as Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, Top Gun and even South Pacific (minus the music), producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writer Randall Wallace and director Michael Bay seem to have aimed little higher than a formula action movie targeted at a younger audience.    The love triangle between Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) is embarrassingly banal, with almost every incident and line of dialogue in the relationship thoroughly predictable. There are numerous other trite and clich√©d incidents and characters, but the movie's treatment of African-American Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr), McCawley's spell in the UK with the RAF, the endless 'joshing' among the pilots, and its female equivalent among the nurses, are all particularly painful. Alec Baldwin's lines as Lt Col Jimmy Doolittle sound especially stilted, though the Internet reveals that some of them are direct quotes from the war hero himself, The film improves when it gets away from the fictional characters and their relationships. The scenes in Washington involving Jon Voight as President Roosevelt, those showing the Japanese preparation for the attack, and of course the attack itself with all the SFX stops pulled out are absorbing and exciting. For me, the visually best sequence is the Japanese's planes' take-off for the attack. And the worst - how about our heroes' blood donation being dripped into Coke bottles? (Later, there is a fleeting more routine product-placement for Pepsi.) Despite all the above reservations, the movie has to be seen, if only as an example of mainstream Hollywood cinema.",Null,0,0,19 July 2001
Zulu," Action-packed but one-sided
","Despite fine performances, exciting action and authentic setting, I feel this is an over-rated movie, and it makes somewhat embarrassing viewing these days. The true story of how 100 British - mostly Welsh - troops resisted 4000 Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift in Natal in 1879 deserved a better screenplay than this gungho, Western-style one-dimensional treatment. There is little character development - indeed, less than in most Hollywood Westerns - and what development there is often makes little sense. In particular, Michael Caine's Lieut Gonville Bromhead is depicted as a cool, professional officer one minute, and a rather helpless incompetent booby the next. We learn nothing about the background of Lieut John Chard (Stanley Baker) and are left baffled as to why an engineer, there to build a bridge, should prove to be such an effective commander in his first engagement. Though early on it looks as though some love-interest might be provided by Ulla Jacobsson as the daughter of the local missionary (Jack Hawkins), she and her father soon fade from the scene. But the main fault is that there is simply no explanation of how and why this stand against overwhelming odds was accomplished. We just see wave after wave of Zulus killing or wounding only a few defenders, while their own dead pile up. I suspect that, despite the Zulus being shown with rifles in one scene, the answer is simply that spears could not prevail against guns. It is true that the Zulus are portrayed as powerful and courageous; but as with the Native Americans in Westerns, this is less to increase our respect for the natives themselves, as for the white men withstanding their onslaught. There is certainly no real attempt to provide the Zulu point of view of the episode; and only the most oblique references to the historical context. On the positive side, almost all the performances are convincing - especially, in addition to the principals, those of Nigel Greene as an imperious Colour Sergeant, James Booth as a malingering Private turned hero, and Patrick Magee as a blood-covered Surgeon; there are some great shots of the warriors drawn up on the brow of the hill; and the train-like sound they make with their spears against their shields, and their chanting, are unforgettable.",Null,3,5,26 December 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," More than just Kung Fu
","This is a magical film, both because of its subject, and its treatment by Ang Lee who is proving himself to be a veritable magician of cinema. In addition to the martial arts and wire assisted 'flying' scenes which are breathtaking, the sets and scenery are spectacular. There is always something on the screen to delight the eye, while the ear is beguiled by atmospheric music featuring Yo-yo Ma's cello. The main story is essentially a simple framework on which to drape this rich tapestry of cinematic action, spectacle and sound - a precious sword is stolen, and must be recovered. But there are several sub-plots, including a classic love story, part of which moves the action from densely decorated and crowded sets in the city and palaces to the vast amber-coloured, empty desert. The acting is in a different convention to the general run of American or European movies, being more stilted and formal, but this is soon replaced by exuberant displays of energy, agility and mobility in the fight scenes!One feature of the movie which has perhaps not received as much attention as it might is that this is a great feminist movie.  Not just  because two of the main protagonists are women (Michelle Yeoh and Zang Ziyi), who provide much of the martial arts action; but because their skill is accepted on its own merits by the male characters in the film, without the astonished, resentful or jokey comments we might normally expect in an American or European movie.It may be that there are some people reluctant to see Tiger because they view it simply as a Kung Fu film, and do not like that genre. If so, they should overcome their resistance, because they are missing something quite wonderful.",10,0,0,4 May 2001
Good Will Hunting," Good quality, intelligent drama - isn't that enough?
","I can't really understand some of the adverse comment on this film; it may not be the best ever, but it's way above average. Basically, GWH is a classic (old-fashioned, if you like) character-driven drama, based on an improbable (and therefore interesting) but by no means impossible plot. It is to be welcomed as one of a seeming minority of Hollywood films, not centred on crime or violence, and/or loaded with SFX. But neither is it a smooth-edged fairytale. Director Gus Van Sant, working to a screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, has opted for a realistic context, especially when it comes to Will's roughneck pals. One result of this is the bad language, which apparently offends some viewers. (For the later, superficially similar, Finding Forrester, set in the Bronx, Van Sant seemed to take a more cautious route.)Damon is excellent as the closet mathematical genius, Will Hunting, who prefers his delinquent lifestyle and the comradeship of his blue-collar buddies to possible academic acclaim. Once again, Robin Williams demonstrates that when cast in a grown-up role he can ditch most of his annoying mannerisms; his portrayal of Sean Maguire, a psychologist able to help others, but unable to help himself get over the death of his wife, is convincing and moving. Affleck as Will's best buddie, and Minnie Driver as Will's rich student girlfriend, have important supporting roles. Each character demonstrates a stage in what seems the main theme of the film - seeking, finding, and keeping hold of, yourself. One weak spot is that the movie doesn't bring out clearly enough the conflict between Will's 'discoverer' Prof Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) and Maguire. Lambeau wants Will to gain fame and fortune for the benefit of science (and his own kudos); Maguire is more interested in Will making his own choice, whatever that is. Those who think the film has a neat, happy ending should consider how Lambeau and Maguire will each view Will's action.",Null,1,4,29 December 2001
Jerry Maguire," Well crafted and enjoyable but lightweight
","This is a well-made, entertaining film with excellent performances, but it is let down by a lack of substance. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as Jerry Maguire, a sports agent seemingly as superficial and go-getting as any in his business, until one day he gets back in touch with his conscience, issues a touchy-feely mission statement, and is duly fired by his corporation. Renee Zellwegger is as sweet as only she can be, playing widowed mother Dorothy, who follows Jerry into the wilderness and into a relationship. And Cuba Gooding Jr earned an Oscar for his stand-out role as Rod Tidwell, a fearless wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, and the only client to stick with Jerry.    The problem is that while Jerry may be a tad more personable than fellow agents, the film fails to demonstrate that his change of heart leads to his doing business any less materialistically or more ethically than they do. Clearly, he isn't helped by Tidwell, who is portrayed as charismatic, straight-talking and family-loving, but also fixated on getting big bucks - as exemplified in the great 'Show me the Money' scene. Indeed, if the film has any message at all, it is that there is precious little scope for ethics in the sports agency business, and that Jerry's moralistic crusade is doomed to failure - but it's unlikely that this is what writer/director Cameron Crowe was actually trying to say. Correspondingly, on the romantic front, the movie is rather lightweight and vague. Jerry and Dorothy have their inevitable getting togethers and breaking-ups, but on none of the occasions is there a great deal of passion or thought. Again, we could put a cynical spin on the movie - Dorothy only wants Jerry as a father for her cute son Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki); and Jerry wants a son more than a wife - but it's doubtful if that's what Crowe wants us to think.  It's a pity; Crowe could have made a stronger film if he'd given his characters some tougher choices, and had been willing to sacrifice a bit of the fun for some real conflict - conveyed by action as well as words.",Null,0,3,21 January 2002
Speed," Loses its pace second time round
","Like most people, I thought this was a great action movie when it was first released; but 6 or 7 years on, seeing it for a second time on TV, I am not so sure. I found myself questioning all the flaws and absurdities in the plot - not because there were more of these than in any other action film, but because at times, despite the surface activity, there was little to grip my attention.    To me, one of the major mistakes in the film was to keep Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) driving the bus for so long. Not only was this ridiculous in terms of the plot as it stands - surely hero Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) or another man should have taken over the wheel at least for a spell - but it also prevented Bullock from doing any real acting or providing much love interest.I think the underlying problem is a common one - the director, Jan de Bont, relied on action and plot to carry his movie, and forgot almost entirely about character. We learn next to nothing about Traven's or Porter's personal histories, and almost everyone else is a cardboard cut-out; except of course for the one character we get to know (and perhaps even care) about most - the villain, Howard Payne, played in typical OTT manner by Dennis Hopper. All in all, I would have preferred to trade in a little speed for a some depth.",Null,0,1,28 May 2001
Am√©lie," If only the fairytale ending had come a little sooner
","This is an enjoyable, winning exercise in whimsy for most of its two hours, but would have been even better with 15 minutes or so lopped off. Audrey Tautou is enchanting as adult Am√©lie who, having lacked affection and interest from her parents when she was young, is wary of the world, but nevertheless tries to make it a better place by surreptitious interventions in her neighbours' lives. Mathieu Kassovitz plays Nino, an equally odd-ball character and would-be conceptual artist, whose current project involves collecting photos discarded near railway station photo-booths. Both are engaged in putting other peoples' lives together, but eventually realise that those in greatest need are themselves.Perhaps the funniest part of the movie is the opening sequence, where in quick fire documentary style, with a voiceover, we are shown Am√©lie's emotionally deprived childhood, with a solemn Flora Guiet playing the heroine as an 8 year old. Some of grown-up Am√©lie's exploits are also engaging, especially sending her father's garden gnome on a world tour; and her returning to an old man a box of playthings he had hidden away as a youngster.But in his quest for originality co-writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has Am√©lie play some extremely malicious tricks on a local nasty grocer, which seem unnecessarily out of her character, and add little to the movie.The scenes in the caf√© where Am√©lie works - with a set of harmless eccentrics only found in movies - are amusing to begin with, but like the film as a whole go on a bit too long. I for one got rather impatient as Am√©lie and Nino bungled date after date, and was hugely relieved when they finally fell into each other's arms. I am unsure what the overall message of the movie is, except that old chestnut - love will find a way.Possibly the real and uncredited star of the movie is Paris, which is beautiful in reality, but even more magical when digitally enhanced. Incidentally, it may seem curious to some viewers that Jeunet has hero Nino work in a sexshop, and that he revives that old clich√© - the kindhearted tart who loves her work (though he carefully doesn't show us the client she's entertaining).",Null,0,1,18 November 2001
The Truman Show," A satire fit to stand alongside 1984
","When I saw Peter Weir's film on its release, I was so engaged by Jim Carrey's wonderful performance as Truman Burbank, that I regarded the film overall as positive and life-enhancing. Seeing it again three years later, I find it a much bleaker experience. Ed Harris as director Christof is such a megalomaniac manipulator that he has perhaps drawn attention away from everybody else involved in the conspiracy against Truman, from the merest technician to the actors playing his best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) and his wife Meryl (Laura Linney). But not only are the production team and players involved in the conspiracy, but so are the millions of viewers of the show. So while we may applaud Truman's brave decision to enter the real world, we should be clear that he will find it full of voyeurs of low intellect and even lower moral standards, who for 30 years have been willing to be entertained by spying on him and depriving him of a real life. Some people might think that the film's satire is too severe, but I think it is fully justified. Day after day TV puts out programs every bit as inane and manipulative as that depicted in the film. It might be argued that, unlike Truman, the participants in 'confession' TV and such programs as Big Brother are volunteers and know exactly what they are getting into. But in a sense they do not, since most of them are unaware of the ridiculous and unattractive sides of their characters which they will reveal to the cameras, and which are the real point of these programs.
The Truman Show stands comparison with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four as a satirical polemic against totalitarian interference in people's lives - but the threat now comes as much from the media as from Government.",8,0,1,8 January 2002
Thirteen Days," Entertaining and instructive
","This  is  an engrossing, thrilling  movie, that sucks you in from the start. It is clearly of great interest to those of us old enough to remember  the Cuban Missile Crisis, the fear while it lasted, the relief when it was over. But the recent spat between the US and China over the spy plane gives the film added relevance for the younger audience; we can be sure that there are much the same arguments between Hawks and Doves in the White House and Pentagon today as in  1962. The film rings most true in showing how few certainties there are when it comes to engaging in or avoiding conflict. Peace prevails eventually, but as much by luck as by judgment; some of President Kennedy's wisest decisions are when he acts indecisively.  Bruce Greenwood graphically portrays the President's confusion and exasperation when faced with conflicting advice, and his mental torment as he contemplates starting a war that would kill millions, while trying not to appear weak. Some find the movie over-reverential to the Kennedies; but this may be because its makers realise more than most the debt owed to the President, his brother and others in 'Camelot' for striving to avoid war during this crisis.At the same time, whether accidentally or intentionally, the film also demonstrates the difficulty the  US often has in seeing itself as others see it, an attitude which the rest of the world finds amusing at best, and scary at worst. How could the American Government not have realised all along that its missiles based in Turkey would be as much of an affront to the USSR, as the potential Cuban missiles were an affront to the USA? In the discussion of  a possible pre-emptive strike on Cuba, there is a glaring absence of any reference to the Cuban civilian casualties that would ensue, or to the negative impact on America's reputation abroad.       On the acting and technical sides the movie is excellent, with great performances by the whole ensemble (but especially Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy); and with exciting air and sea action sequences interspersing the inevitable long stretches of talk. Often criticised Kevin Costner  is more than effective as Presidential Aide, Kenny O'Donnell,  particularly in the domestic scenes with his family. However, the need to keep Costner at the centre of the movie perhaps led to a couple of flaws. Close as O'Donnell might have been to John Kennedy in younger days, would he really have had such free and easy access to the President, and such a casual relationship with him?  Even harder to accept is the role the film gives O'Donnell in persuading airforce pilots to play down any encounters they had with Cuban anti-aircraft fire. Would highly trained and disciplined servicemen have taken much notice of an unknown voice on the 'phone, claiming to be a White House official?
Such niggles aside, this is a great movie, containing important lessons, and is a credit to Hollyood. Now, how about a Russian movie, telling the story as seen from Moscow?",8,0,0,30 April 2001
