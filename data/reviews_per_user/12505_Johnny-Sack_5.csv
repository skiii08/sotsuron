Kill Bill: Vol. 2," And Tarantino Knocks One Out The Park
","And Tarantino brings his cinematic opus to a close.But not in a way that people expected. This has hardly any of Vol. 1's searing colours, splashing crimson or R-rated cartoons. Instead Tarantino, a true genius of modern cinema, immerses himself in characters and dialogue. He reveals all exposition and backstory vitally missing from the first installment. And he does it with sheer class. Utterly beautiful shots, perfect performances and his trademark humour blacker than Elle Driver's eye patch. But this is a true case of substance finally killing style, unlike Vol. 1. The emotional journey that the Bride goes through is stunning. And both Thurman and Carradine deliver iconic performances filled with weight and depth. And the final scenes, drenched in emotion and operatic Morricone are some of the best Tarantino or anybody has ever done.In short one of the best films of the last ten years.",9,5,9,2 December 2005
Collateral," A Contempory Classic
","What looks like a very pretentious piece of studio action rubbish is actually one of the few films of the last five years that I personally would hold up as a classic. Of course it is easy to see how some could disagree but I feel some will agree. This was one of the best of last years mixed bag of offerings and is a truly impressive piece of work. With Tom Cruise using more than his boyish good looks and snow white smile to create a character he plays a killer with a subtle sense of relish and manages to create a very threatening character. Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett provide good work too but the real star of this film is Michael Mann. Mann is a great film stylist and this is arguably his most stylised effort yet. Using advanced DV he creates a visually arresting portrayal of his beloved LA and gives the scene's a raw quality that would, perhaps, not been as effective on film. The scene in the club where his use of action becomes very rough and gritty is superb and extremely enjoyable to view, especially on the big screen. There is also a strong independent style of film-making in the mood and design of this movie and that along with two stars being excellently cast against type (if you will) only further prove that this is a devilishly gritty and gripping portrayal of contempory LA. And one if not THE best film of last year.",9,1,2,3 January 2005
Alien vs. Predator," A Tragic misfire
","Paul WS Anderson is possibly the most hated director alive. But he really shouldn't be. Its all about opinion and talent level at the end of the filmic day. 'Soldier' was not that bad. I can think of dozens of higher rated films that fit comfortably (in my opinion) next to it, Spider Man 2 springs to mind, however i do think its always a little harsh to be that unkind to the guy. However here you are all justified really. It seems amazing how a genuine fan of these two franchises could mess it up so spectacularly. The fights are not very well filmed, the characters are thinner than toe nail clippings and the fact that there's little to no gore means this will never be treated with the same prestigious opinions as Scott's or McTiernan's work.This really is a bad film in anyone's eyes (whether some parts were mildly enjoyable or not). And a terrific misfire with a capital m. An almost instantly forgettable film experience. Really all you needed was thrilling one on one bitch fights, buckets of gore and slime, stylish direction and a few winking in jokes to the previous films and it would have been serviceable enough. Oh well.",2,0,1,23 October 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Action and style make up for a weak script.
","Tarantino is a true talent in the eyes of many. Few debuts have been as handsomely constructed and powerfully original as Reservoir Dogs and few films have been as enjoyable and influential as Pulp Fiction. Both celebrate the art of script writing that awarded the supreme motor mouthed auteur with an Oscar. However with Volume 1 of his martial art epic Kill Bill, we see his weakest script work yet. The dialogue is slightly clunky at times and reams away from his most celebrated work but what it lacks in lines it exceeds in action. Compared with the other so-called action films released that year Kill Bill screams talent. Crash zooms, jump cuts and glowing crimson abound. The final 30 minutes or so of this film, where Tarantino flexes his action muscles are some of the most thrilling of the year. It should be clear to most that with this film Tarantino is showing us a different side of his world, and in terms of action and style he simply excels.",7,2,5,12 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Most Visually Stunning and Dramatically Powerful of all Star Wars Films!
","There's a shot halfway through Revenge of the Sith that has a disgruntled Yoda rub his forehead and sigh. While it's not a glorious battle scene (of which this film has many) its a strong image for Star Wars. One it signals a breakthrough in modern CGI film-making. Two it shows a subtextual sigh of relief from all the artists at Lucasfilm. All showing their collective talents and saying a weary goodbye to the greatest cinematic franchise of all time. The visual style of this film is flawless, gone are the rather static scenes of Phantom Menace and the overly gaudy CGI splashes of Attack of the Clones. And present is beautifully designed planets and environments and some of the most epic and awe inspiring sequences in film history. As Anakin and Obi-Wan battle it out to a truly rousing operatic track on the hellish planet Mustafar it switches(in vintage Lucas style) to Emperor Palpatine and Yoda tearing the Senate building apart in a relentlessly exciting duel. As far as action and spectacle go, you can't beat this. But the narrative and acting has been improved too. For once in the prequels we have a fully realised and dramatically engaging story. Anakin's perilous plunge to the Dark Side dealt with in an adult fashion, so no midi-chlorians and young cringeworthy cries of 'yippee!' Just powerfully moving scenes of Jedi genocide and good become soured to bad. Some scenes show real dramatic charge and others political poignancy ('This war represents a failure to listen!') Evreyone does there best with Lucas's notoriously strange dialogue and all do fine. But particular praise MUST be given to Ian McDiarmid's excellent performance in this film. Boasting incredible acting gravitas and finally given something to do in he prequels, he delivers his lines with relish and energy. If there's any justice he'll be clutching a golden statue next year! Only occasionally does Lucas falter with poor dialogue and slow pacing but no film is perfect. And above all Lucas triumphs so well, with this visually thrilling soap opera, that any self respecting cinema fan can't help but tingle with excitement as they see the last piece of history from that Galaxy far, far away.
