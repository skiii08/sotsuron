Your Name.," Beautiful film**Objective review**
","Breathtakingly beautiful film with amazing animation, story line and music..however I have one complaint and trust me when I say I've seen many films..I had bought over a 1000 DVDs and gone to cinema for many films and I've watched a crazy amount of films/series and anime on TV and online so I really do have big experience with films and I do write short novels myself so let me explain it as simple as I can,The problem with this film is that the author tried to play with time but failed at it..had he found another way around it would've been perfect so here's the problem:1)During their body swaps it was clearly stated that they were the same age. 2)Being the same age but her dying 3 years before he started switching bodies with her means that there was a time thing where the past her swapped bodies with the present him. 3)At some point she decided to go see him but he didn't know who she were because it was in the past before he started seeing his dreams however she gone to see him and he was the same age in the past when he should've been 3 years younger as he confirmed he kept her hair tie for 3 years and being so young a 3 years difference he should've looked younger. 4)The way she stayed alive is that they changed the past for her to live but at that time when she didn't die she would be around 16 years old I believe which means she never died and by the time Taki started having his dreams, 3 years in her world would've passed already which makes her 3 years older than him in the actual time meaning that when he finally found her at the end she should be older than him which I doubt it was thought of.That is all and other than that the film was amazing and I've watched it few times and I still love it!",9,2,7,23 March 2017
