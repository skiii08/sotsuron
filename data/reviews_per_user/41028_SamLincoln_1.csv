The Ring," Have to go see it again...
","So...I saw it, hoping for at LEAST a slight scare. To be honest, after spending a whole last semester and summer watching almost all 'scary' movies in our video stores there were only a few SCENES in which I giggled nervously.So the ring: I was planning on seeing the Japanese version this summer, but decided to wait till the Hollywood version came out (mainly cause our video store doesnt have japanese subtitled movies) I brought a couple friends (its easier to NOT be scared with people you know around) Not that I really worried, but I didnt want to see it alone.Needless to say, I missed half the movie. After the first scene I began to learn that when a TV was in the room and I didnt want to get too freaked out I should close my eyes. (bad mistake) but it was impulse and I wish so bad I could have been a little less freaked out.In any case I came home SO excited. I had finally found a movie that gave me the shivers, though Ill HAVE to see it again seems how I missed so much. I would recomend it highly to anyone looking for a good thriller.",10,0,0,6 November 2002
