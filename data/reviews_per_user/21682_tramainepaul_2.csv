It," Must see while in theaters! So scary but oh so fun!
","You'll float too... Lol. First of all, hubby and I never see movies for date night and on a whim we did. Excellent choice for a date or group night out. A lot of scary movies are cheesy, but Stephen King delivers again..and again..and again during this movie. Don't want to spoil it. Genius and hilarious. I felt like I was on a constant roller coaster ride. First you laugh...then you hear scary music...your heart starts beating faster...uh oh...then wham! First of all, I am a grown person as well as my husband. Afterwards, my husband said...please don't take me to see anymore scary movies. I would consider that a compliment to the movie. Also, the kids were excellent actors. Many kudos to the kids for their excellent work, to the screenwriter, to everyone who had anything to do with this movie. Wow. Looking forward to chapter 2.",10,1,3,27 October 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers 2: Advocates of a Modern Day Minstrel Show
","What do you do when it is politically incorrect to make fun of African Americans on T.V.? Answer: Change them into machines mimicking African Americans and portraying racist stereotypes. I was shocked when watching Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, to see two robots, complete with ghetto behavior, 'jive' talking, random fighting, and gold teeth to be what I saw as a blatant stereotype of African Americans. At one point when the robot was asked if he could translate some Hieroglyphics written in the language of the Primes (Optimus Prime's ancestry) he said, 'Nah man, I don't read.' Excuse me???? I cringed every time that I saw the characters. Another robot who had a black voice also repeatedly used incorrect grammar, stating, when it was time to parachute to Eygpt, 'we best be getting' off dis plane.' However, we were not the only people insulted in this movie. Women, Latinos, those of Middle Eastern origin, children, intelligent people, and people who paid to see the film were also victims of this so-called blockbuster. First of all, women. Megan Fox was portrayed as a brainless sycophant whose only desire in life was to love Sam/Shia I don't understand why Megan, a.k.a. Makaela, was not in a community college and her only option in life was to beg Shia Lebouf to love her??? From recent interviews, the girl obviously has a mind and likes to use it. I personally would have like to have seen some of her spunky personality on the big screen instead of her face in people's crotches (yes, it did happen) and a robot humping her leg (again, I am not making this up). All the other women were also stereotypes, no doubt created in the sexually starved minds of the nerds who wrote this out of touch and surprising disappointing film. The mom had really funny moments which ran into overkill when she ate weed filled brownies, tackled a college guy, and told the dad, 'hey professor, I would do anything for an A.' The movie would have been better served if she had tried to eat the brownies and Shia had taken them from her with his usual one-liner. They tried to stir up a conflict for Mikaela and Shia by hiring a blond model who slightly rivaled Megan's one of a kind looks, but it ended in stupidity better left completely out of the movie. If they really wanted a conflict, they should have had a hunky guy hired to help with her dad's car shop while Mikaela went to school and Shia is jealous. That is more realistic. Then they could have had a smart girl be a road companion through their road adventures. I could go on about how they could have made this better, but I need a paycheck first. Latinos were insulted by having a dumb, roommate, side-kick who only cried, pulled down his pants, and got into random sexual positions with men. Last time I checked, making fun of a person's sexual orientation isn't funny either. People of Middle East origins were insulted when Shia and company tried to cross the border lines. First of all, they made a midget the head person in charge. Why is being shorter funny? Was it supposed to get a cheap laugh? Did the writers think that was funny? Then, the border police let them pass through when they found out that he was from New York, as if he would be that stupid. The crazy, meat-shop, former sector 7 guy told him as he was passing,'you look like the guy that makes my falafels.' The craziness doesn't end. The movie had so much cursing and sexual innuendos that I was disgusted. I felt bad for parents who thought that they were taking their children to 'family-friendly' movie. Dogs were humping dogs, cars said 'suck my popsicle', Megan Fox was humped by a robot, Megan Fox landed face down on a guys groin area, professors made lewd comments at girls in class, all girls on the college campus were naked, half-naked, or about to be naked, there was a make out scene were a girl's dress rises up and her underwear is shown, dirty robots, dirty robot parts, and even Shia's mom says uncharacteristic things and gets her butt slapped. The cursing was out of control. Everyone was cursing, especially the robots. They were cursing when it made better sense not to curse or even speak at all. Intelligent people were insulted in this movie. A lot of things didn't make sense. Where did the hot-girl transformer come from and why didn't she kill him and take his memory on one of the gazillion chances that she had? When did the Decepticons start making human cyborgs? How did the blond model transformer know that Shia was in college? How did she get enrolled and in his classes? If she knew that much, couldn't she have killed him a more convenient and earlier time? That could have been left out of the movie. Why did the guy sent to shut down the Transformers release all the key information that the Decepticons needed in less than thirty seconds? Aren't there code words in the National Defense? How did Shia find time to go to a hospital and bandage his arm when they were running from the bad robots? How can someone be dropped, in a car, over five hundred feet, head first, through a building roof, crash, with a head-on collision on to the concrete below, and all passengers are not only saved by the air bag, but they get out of the car and run? Last, but not least, why were the college freshman, on average, 35 years old? Basically, anyone who has seen this movie and people above the age of three are owed an apology for this horrible let-down. To leave on a positive note, the computer graphics staff did a good job and thank you for helping me understand how robots procreate.",3,4,11,5 July 2009
