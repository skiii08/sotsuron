First Man," One of the most beautifully-made film I've ever seen.
","Words cannot describe how masterful but at the same time gripping and immersive this film is. It is probably one of the best films that has err come out of this decade. Well-acted, well-directed, well-scored, and poignant.I'm gonna admit though the narrative is average and formulaic akin to a lot of biographical movies.Nevertheless, it is a gripppng and powerful experience watching this.",10,2,7,14 October 2018
