Black Swan," Black Swan Review
","Another visually intense film from Darren Arronofsky, the director of Requiem for a Dream. I made the mistake of assuming this film would be more mainstream and therefore less horrifying than Requiem, but this film definitely goes just as far to push you to your limits. Before seeing it, a friend described it to me as 'hypersexual', and I have to agree with that. It left me a little bit afraid to be alone with myself, to be honest. An excellent psychological thriller to follow my Fight Club review. This is another film that I will pretend is anywhere close to science fiction because the psychological is manifested in reality in a stunning, yet fantastic way.To address a concern many of the fellows might have, I dragged my boyfriend to see this film with promises that it would be as incredible as Requiem, and he agrees with me that about halfway in it doesn't matter that it's a movie about ballet. Just in case you were worried. The music and dance really added visually to a great story, and I probably don't have to mention the parallels to the ballet of the swan queen or the black and white imagery. The ballet allows Arronofsky to continue to plague his films with stark and artistic images. He pulled it off beautifully.I won't give a plot synopsis because there are excellent ones all over the internet. What I will say is that while you know the basic story, you will be shocked at where it takes you. From the trailer, I thought I knew where this was going, but felt it would still be worth the ride. It turns out I was wrong, and without spoilers, let me just say that to enjoy this film thoroughly, forget everything you saw in the trailer and go at it anew. Watch Nina closely for the effect each subtle event has on her, and forget what the reviews have told you is going to happen.This is a movie about what can happen to a sweet girl in a viscous, competitive world, and I don't just mean the ballet. Nina is unnaturally innocent for her age, to the point of being emotionally immature, and the controlling forces in her life cause her to break free in a dark way that goes beyond what is expected for rebellious little girls. She becomes the Black Swan because it is expected of her to shed her innocence as she comes of age, but at the same time, her mother exerts a suffocated control over her, expecting her to be a child forever, and even Thomas, the artistic director of the show, is controlling while he pretends to free her. He has control over her sexuality as he forces her into an unhealthy relationship of the strong dominating over the weak.A great story of the mind, with excellent art direction and a very imaginative manifestation of the psyche. It's been a long time since a movie has glued me to the screen to the extent that I can forget my own existence for the entire third act.Starlight - http://starlightmusing.blogspot.com/",10,1,3,19 January 2011
Fight Club," My Favourite Movie is Called Fight Club
","'It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything'I'm really adamant about this. Fight Club is my favourite movie of all time. The main point of this review is to get people to watch this film that has such deeper meaning than the title suggests.Consumerism has enslaved the modern man to 9 to 5 weekdays. That's the basic message, but what makes this film great is that after watching it time and time again, the message becomes more complex and well drawn out. In a way it's harder to put into words than the first time I ever saw it, because whether or not we are to agree with Tyler's point of view, or agree with how far he takes it, is really up in the air.It's not hard to imagine that a 9 to 5 office job running reports for a major car company's failure rates would cause insomnia when paired with the modern bachelor lifestyle. What's the point in having a fine line between waking and sleeping when your whole life is spent in a stupor? Our protagonist, Rupert/Cornelius/Travis/Jack (his real name is never given) is looking to change his life, to re-define himself, and he's not a healthy person to begin with. His mental illness is evident not only in his insomnia but in his droning narration, his cynicism, and his addiction to self-help groups. Attending groups for testicular cancer, tuberculosis, blood parasites, you name it, helps Jack feel like someone is actually listening to him (because they think he's dying), helps him cry, and ultimately helps him sleep at night. Until he finds something else, something better, that addresses the problem directly.Jack meets Tyler Durden - a man who lives a fulfilling and meaningful life far, far outside of the rules of society. He lives in squalor and filth, not as a result of poverty, but as the result of having rejected the materialist lifestyle of the young American worker. He knows what he wants out of life, he has a plan, and this makes Jack admire him to the point of exaltation. Jack and Tyler begin the fight club, a kind of therapy for the middle-class working bachelor who has no meaning in his life, but it ends up going farther than Jack ever imagined. This is Jack's first mistake, and a road to a very dark place. Much of the movie's message really hinges on whether or not he wants to be there in the end.---Spoilers ahead---Another Sunday spent movie watching. I've seen this film about a dozen times, and it gets better and better with each re-watch. This time I was left questioning Jack's final feelings on the actions of Project Mayhem. In the final scene it seems to be really left up to us to decide whether Tyler managed to free Jack from his chains, or whether we are to believe that Tyler went too far. Or do we get a combination of their two extreme viewpoints. Does freedom require violent rebellion?Jack doesn't seem too concerned that he has blown up all of the major credit-card company's headquarters. His final struggle was to overcome Tyler's control over his life and retain his sanity. Watching the skyscrapers plunge to the ground, accompanied by the soulful vocals of 'Where is my Mind' by The Pixies, I'm personally filled with a sense of peace and acceptance. 'Let the chips fall where they may,' as Tyler said. Jack fought against Tyler's incredibly dramatic strike for economic equilibrium, but now that it has happened and there is nothing we can do about it, we may as well enjoy the outcome. I think this is the best I can do to put the message into words. We're not struggling against our own rebellion any more. It's happened and we're enjoying the ride.",10,1,3,18 January 2011
The Hangover Part II," Comedy or Drama?
","So, personally, I just didn't find Hangover II very funny. There were surprisingly few jokes. The jokes were great, don't get me wrong, but I found myself really waiting for something funny to happen. This sequel largely focused on the emotional trauma of the characters repeating their weekend from hell, rather than keeping the laughs coming. It didn't aaall need to be as over the top as Stew sleeping with the hermaphrodite, but why couldn't we have something subtler between that and the scene with Paul Giamatti? In fact, THAT scene wasn't even nearly as funny as it should have been.Greatly underwhelming. Not worth the movie ticket. And it's so disappointing, because I went in with high expectations. Just wasn't that funny.",6,1,3,5 June 2011
