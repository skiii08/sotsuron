Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Beginning
","The original trilogy came out before I was born and I didn't see it until the year before TPM came out. My expectations were high and so was everybody else's. In the end I was somewhat disappointed, but I'd been taken on a good ride.    It was a wonderful movie visually and the plot seemed historical in origin. I'll admit the acting and script were on the downside. There were some exceptions though. Liam Neeson was strong in a few scenes and so was Ian Mcdiarmid. You can tell Lucas was not really confident that he could make another SW film. That's why the script was so-so. Jar-Jar is funny in some scenes and annoying in others. Jar-Jar was a risk, but an overall entertaining one. Jake Lloyd was a fair choice for a 9 year old Anakin. Natalie Portman was not given much to work with which is why her performance is just ok.     I have to say I like it overall, we see how things were in the glory days of the galaxy and when Jedi were numerous. The Beginning is an interesting one that starts the most famous saga of all time. It doesn't hold a candle to IV- VI, but it's better than general Hollywood fare. **1/2 out of ****",7,1,2,19 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Redemption of Anakin Skywalker/The End
","Here it is. The last episode of the Star Wars saga and the final step of the Skywalker odyssey is a fitting conclusion. The first time I saw this it immediately became my favorite movie off all time. I watched it every week for a year. Then I began to look at it critically. It's not the best Star Wars. It's not the best movie ever made. It's still my favorite though. The idea that Darth Vader can be saved is the reason I hold above the other two.   This film wraps up everything nicely. Han Solo is rescued from the bowels of Jabba's palace. Luke returns to Yoda. Luke confronts both Vader and the Emperor. The puzzle comes together. Luke changes so much from the end of ESB to the beginning of this film. The battle with Vader at the end Episode V caused Luke to finally grow up. he becomes his own man. He becomes a Jedi. Darth Vader also has been changed by the confrontation at Bespin. We see Vader as more of a human figure, he's not just this evil machine. He was once a man, a teenager, and a little boy. We feel sorry for him. He's just a pathetic half-man in a cumbersome suit.At the end of the movie you actually care for him. You feel impacted by his last  words on the Death Star II. When you see Anakin with the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Yoda you are relieved. Anakin Skywalker has been saved. Looking at this critically there are a few things that are a step down from the past two films. Harrison Ford seems to be bored with the job of Han Solo. The Ewoks seem like unnecessary addition to make the film more kid-friendly. As the original trilogy was being made it grew up. Star Wars was swashbuckling adventure. Empire was a darker more operatic film that added turmoil to the story and true emotion. In Jedi the most feared man in the universe is saved by his own son. He becomes a father. A lot of the originality seems to be gone because we're used to the material by now. Still this will always be the Star Wars that gives me hope. If Lord Vader can come back. Maybe we all can.",8,0,1,5 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Perfect Title
","Most of the general public has been disappointed with Episode I, so they set their sights a little lower for Episode II. This is why it was liked better. Lucas was more confident this time around and tried to add some charm to the story. Making a war film,love story, and mystery in one film is not easy, but George lucas has succeeded.Ten years after Episode I we meet up with Anakin and Obi-Wan as they are assigned to protect a now Sen. Padme Amidala. Lucas is trying to make these three the next Luke,Han, and Leia. The acting is better this time around from the main characters. Ewan McGregor is more comfortable as Obi-Wan and Portman is allowed better lines to showcase her acting talent. Hayden Christenson does good in some scenes, but in others he's too dry and wooden. Samuel L. Jackson is a little more lively as Mace Windu, but not a true character. Ian Mcdiarmid is good and Christopher Lee is powerful as always. Jimmy Smits's Bail Organa is held back in this chapter. The digital Yoda seems pretty convincing.The story is complex if not too complex for it's own good. The Love story is corny but hey I guess most teenage love is like that. The action and visuals are what really make the movie. Attack of the Clones is all too proper for the film's adrenaline-pumping climax.The whole detective plot with Kenobi is interesting to people who like that genre but it might drag on for others. The dialogue is fairly weak throughout the first half of the movie, but the second half does better. This is better than the last but not quite as good Empire or A New Hope. It's almost on level with ROTJ. All in all, Attack of the Clones is the is the boldest chapter yet. The trilogy seems to get better as it goes on so I look forward to Episode III*** out of ****",6,0,0,19 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkein meets Jackson with incredible results.
","The year 1937 brought the release of J.R.R. Tolkien's little adventure novel entitled 'The Hobbit'. It was a charming story about a hobbit(small folk)who is swept away from his quiet life by a wizard and twelve dwarves to slay a horrible dragon. It stood on its own as fascinating piece of literature, but it was just a prelude. It was a prelude to the greatest literary epic ever written. 'The Lord of the Rings' is a one thousand page novel published in three volumes back in the 1950's. Tolkein's novel has gained a massive fanbase and was brought to the screen in the form of animated films in the late 70's and early 80's. In the 90's though a Kiwi director by the name of Peter Jackson was moved to bring the novel to the big screen. The world of cinema hasn't been the same since December 19, 2001.Peter Jackson has done the impossible in bringing the the series to life. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is a powerful, sweeping epic filled with brilliant visuals and and a strong cast to back it up. Jackson and co-writers Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens have done a good job adapting the first volume. The decision to make the film Frodo-centric was a wise one. There were some liberties taken with events and timespans but they remained faithful to the spirit of Tolkien. The only complaint I have about the script is the additional content with the Arwen. Having reread the books just before I saw the movie. It seemed out of place having her bring Frodo to Rivendell. It was a bold gamble, but I don't really think it helped or hurt the movie too much to notice. The reason this movie is so good is because of the outstanding performances given by the ensemble cast. Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice for Frodo but he pulls it off without a hitch. Sam is played by Sean Astin, another unlikely choice, with sort of innocence and intensity. I really believed he was going to stick by Frodo if it was the last thing he ever did. The most notable performance of course was Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf. He is the perfect Gandalf. He seems superby wise and unbelievably powerful. He deserved the nomination for best supporting actor. Viggo Mortenson fits the role of Aragorn to a tee and Sean Bean is wonderful as tormented soul Boromir. The two mischievous hobbits Merry and Pippin are brought to life with hilarious results by Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan. Rounding out the fellowship is Gimli played by John Rhys-Davies. He brought a smile to my face. I won't forget Ian Holm. He is perfect as Bilbo. It's too bad we don't see more of him in the books and movies as he's my favorite character. Holm is brilliant. The cast really drives this film. Oh yeah the special effects are good too(haha). In late 2002 an extended version was released and in my opinion it is greater than the theatrical cut. With roughly thirty minutes of new footage it is the version to own. I liked the fact the Ian Holm's part in the beginning was fleshed out. It is even closer to Tolkein.***1/2 out of **** I give the Extended Edition **** out ****",Null,0,0,22 July 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not what I expected
","For my birthday in 1994, my aunt bought me Jurassic Park on video. I had missed it in theatres and was incredibly excited. I was not disappointed when the credits began to role. I really enjoyed the film and was looking forward to a sequel. Many ideas went through my head for Jurassic Park 2. When 'The Lost World' came out a read a copy from my local library. I enjoyed the book, especially the suspense that was around finding The second island. Then in '97 I came out of the theatres thinking, ' Gee, was that really Jurassic Park II.' I enjoyed the film to a certain point, but couldn't see past the commerical feel of the movie. The characters were strong, and the plot was fairly good. But, the novelty had worn off. It was a good film on it's own, but it couldn't match the power of the first. The action scenes were wonderful, the dinosaurs were realistic, but you can only go so far with theme dinosaur chaos. All, in all a worthy attempt at a sequel, but sometimes classics are the ones without a sequel.**1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,23 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The original space opera.
","In 1977 George Lucas started a franchise that will ever remain as a milestone in popular culture. Yes this is the original, maybe the best, the only STAR WARS. That name has been associated with so much during the past 25 years. Now that the prequels are in full swing we view the classic trilogy as the untouchables. The film had the perfect cast of characters and actors. Mark Hamill as the young and eager Luke Skywalker. A then almost unknown Harrison Ford as the smug Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as the rebel princess Leia Organa. Everything here was so new and refreshing. This is one of those rare sci-fi adventures that has heart and soul. Alec Guiness was mysterious as Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi. James Earl Jones was perfect as the personality of Darth vader. Everything came together on this Star Wars film like it never has since.C-3P0 and R2-D2 are classic and original.A New hope isn't without it's flaws though. George Lucas's script is a little full cliches, but it's still classic. I don't believe this is the best Star Wars movie, but it's the first. It's a good swashbuckling adventure that the prequels are striving for and may never reach. After 25 years it's set to stay as a part of movie history.**** out of ****",9,0,0,19 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Yoda and the one of the most powerful lines of all time.
","When I first saw The Empire Strikes Back I didn't really care for it. I wasn't really into the darkness that covered the movie. Now, I'm a little older and can appreciate this movie. This is the best Star Wars movie hands down. Not my favorite, but the greatest. This takes the Star Wars saga to a whole new level with the introduction of Yoda and the fleshing out of Darth Vader. Every returning character from A New Hope is given so much more to work with and it shows. We learn more about Han's past, Luke's past, and Luke's future. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. From Bespin, the cloud city to Dagobah, the lonely hideout for Master Yoda, each one of the locations presented support the turmoiled, chill of space feel that dominates the movie.The climax of the movie is the most memorable climax of all time. It's been alluded to more times than can be counted. It also takes the battle between good and evil from a back and white area to a shade of gray. The fact that the innocence of Luke can come from the pure evil of Darth Vader is perhaps the biggest revelation. This is one of the best sequels of all time. Check it out.**** out of ****",10,2,4,5 April 2003
Jurassic Park," Groundbreaking look at Dinosaurs and cloning
","When Jurassic Park was released in June 1993 we got a look at dinosaurs in a whole different view. The film had incredible special effects, but a movie cannot make it on special effects alone. The plot of this movie really carried the special effects. Most of the time it's the other way around. The plot stuck very closely to the book except for a couple of character issues. People got to see dinosaurs not just as giant lizard monsters but as living surviving animals. Ive read that there wasn't much character development. There was some development, but the development wasn't supposed to be on the characters it was supposed to be on cloning and the dinosaurs. The acting was very good, especially characters such as Ian Malcolm and Alan Grant. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum did very good jobs of displaying these characters. Also, the late Bob Peck who was Robert Muldoon in the film gave incredible intensity to his character. For people who have forgotten the main plot, this movie is about a rich entrepreneur named John Hammond who has cloned dinosaurs and has built a tourist park on a remote island of the coast of Costa Rica. His corporate lawyer has concerns about the park and John invites a paleontologist, paleobotanist, theoretical mathematician, and his two grandchildren to experience and tour the island.Jurassic Park's security system brakes down and the dinosaurs are let free.Then the tourists have to try to get jurassic park working again and get off of the island. So in all I have to say this is an incredible movie with a great special effects and a interesting cast and plot. ***1/2 out of ****",8,1,2,30 May 2001
