The King's Speech," a beautiful film
","The true story of Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth), who in 1936, after the abdication of his brother, suddenly finds himself on the English throne. Europe is preparing for war. The nation and the situation requires forceful and resolute monarch, who will unify the British people and raised the rebellion against the Nazi threat. A touching, historical drama atypically genuine and humane story about a king who stuttered, about the British nation on the eve of the war and the mass media who was looking for a leader and demanded speaker. The King's Speech is definitely a film that wants to please, but it does so sincerely and prudently to its charm simply does not make sense to resist. Warm, funny and deeply human story with nostalgic view on last days of British colonial grandeur. The viewer is thrown into one of the most critical moments of the 20th century, is a film for young and old, for those who love history and for those looking for more personal, intimate story, for those who live on the dead and swear to the Queen, and for hardcore antimonarhists",9,0,0,17 November 2015
