"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," My take on Priscillianism
","Exemplify a wacky dress without being tacky, and beyond, could be the film's tag. Whether you wear it on a frock or naked, should be aimed at people who say the film is OK, nicely done and frothy and all, but without much to it. Wrong. Wrong viewers they are that downplay the film's witty heart.I do not think there has ever been a film that delivers its ethos in the tag-line 'a cock in a frock on a rock - that's what our country hardly needed'. The smashing alliteration outwits the scenario-in-a-capsule phrase of this more kind-than-kin road movie. It must have to do with something else. Queering the deadpan or deadpanning the queer? I am not sure I can fathom Terence Stamp's take on delivering what he says.All three actors bless the idea of casting and based on their choice there should be a new kind of lifetime achievement award, bestowed by the Vatican, for the film should be included in all discussions of trinitarian discourse: Bernadette as a very dignified Holy Spirit or as trans-gendered Godhead, Adam as a reckless Holy Spirit or Son in drug-fueled high heels, Tick as Father, for sure. It should - the least - provoke a wave for re-evaluating the doctrines of Priscillian, the early Church heretic, or martyr depending on your appreciation of controversial matters, who was the first person in the history of Christianity to be executed for heresy: he mostly lived in the desert like Adam, Bernadette and Tick, but being a strict ascetic, had failed to watch the film and be converted.It is a sly achievement to which one gives up and surrenders intelligently, when you realize that the film is a tender plea for man's precarious status, his always tenderness-seeking or wildly avoiding identity: the women in the film range from the bully in the bar to the inane, almost extra-terrestrially squeaking runner, to the unintelligible vagina performer, and when in the and at last we encounter a human being, Tick's wife, the rich ambiguities are neither explained nor skimmed: we now understand that these women with their full range of caricature and sexual being, are there to put into relief the three characters' embattled manhood (Tick trying to sell the odious face-creams totally drunk in that bar, by his drawl rightfully pronounces the product: woe-man): Bernadette still clutches to some core of enjoyment in what concerns her pre-operation self, as her rage whenever Adam calls her by her earlier name (and this somehow counter-contrasts, to call the effect by that name, with Adam's counter-molestation flash-back), Ralph, erupts, Tick has an amazingly human face charting all delicate and anxious hesitations concerning what is to be a father, drawing a line to procreation, and this, in turn, has an uncanny resonance to and with the fact that Adam seems peculiarly parentless. Perhaps it is this difficult to grasp effect that from the three performances the one that stayed with me was Pearce's with all its reckless abandon.Terence Stamp has not demonstrated that he is from another solar system that well even in Pasolini's 'Theoreme' - it is surely a system of stellar poise and dignity, and we rarely see that around here; and how difficult it is to have Hugo Weaving's strong, unmissable face playing a humane character without something leaking into false notes. The story is perfect in being a pilgrim's progress and its queering of it: Stephan Elliott touched genius with this film, and so did the leads, and so do we. Thank you.",Null,5,7,21 October 2011
Black Swan," Black smarm
","This is a berserk combo of Polanski's Repulsion and The Red Shoes, with a dash of All About Eve thrown in. Aronofski is one of the greatest available hacks working today in movies. Having once seen his feature-length fortune cookie, the New Aged The Fountain, one entertains the certainty that this director will never give a truly heartfelt film, but will twist everything into false spirituality, unless one buys such spiritual obfuscation. The camera work is superlative. It's the best thing in the film, surpassing even Nathalie Portman who is excellent and dubious, given such a defaming concoction concerning ballerinas. And I say that because once the instructor of the company appears early in the film, this has a jarring effect on matters of true class and virtuoso muddle; or later, another teacher who shows her how to make her hands fluctuate displays a magnificent back (we do not see her face), but the director opts for the grim choice of making it rhyme with Portman's itching back. These two appearances are the only anchoring moments for the script's absurd choices, at least as long as the action takes place in a corps and is not just a pretext of a frame. I will pass the lesbian scene which levels wildly things down and exposes the mix and match approach.Even the black and white design after a while passed from grim to tiresome to finally naive.",Null,0,3,28 January 2011
The Young Victoria," Sovereigns for the masses
","The usual problem with films concerning sovereigns is that they are reluctant to fully take charge and do what they have to do with their subject, whatever it is they want to do; the result is, invariably, melodramatic with a numbing streak, unless one is a fanatic for picturing the life of kings and queens on a middle-class level. I, for one, like films that would have me forget that the people depicted are sovereigns, so engrossing the ritual of power should be, but not for constantly reminding me that they, too, are humanely human people, after all.They are not, or, rather, were. Once upon a time they had specific symbolic mandates, that nowadays seem imported from another solar system. But this little film wants to be luminous as the sun, no matter the solar system: miss Blunt's cheeks assure us for it, as if she was illumined by an inner thrust, and that's all fine, as is the obvious, layered effort a person of power should handle concerning all matters that entertain his acuity (or her blossoming femininity), but it is not enough.The film, although guided by a director that shows a nuanced, sometimes on the verge of grand, assured grasp on compositional level (especially the sense of architectural building up in the first scene), falls allover the place. What is its subject actually? Nuance and variety of subjects cannot be the case. A bit of romance, a bit of machinations (but straightforward please, so as not to make it too much of a burden for young Victoria, after all, it's the 'early years'), stunning costumes, matching sets, an entertaining Jim Broadbent as King, some romance, some royalty, etc. but it's a bore.Abide on the surface, and it will tell what it has to. Paul Valery once said, 'there is nothing more profound than surface.' Why should we try to humanize it? What we get is a colorful, shining, unimaginative bore. Iznogud (know the comic?), if you get the homonym; like Rupert Friend, positively unassuming as he is, but isn't he like Orlando Bloom in the place of Orlando Bloom? Contrast to that the ever-effective Mr. Bettany as usually polishing his unsympathetic self, and the thing is already edgy as a lump.Fluffy, too (one muses over how much importance did the casting gave to miss Blunt's chin resembling the one Queen Victoria had, and abides on the memory of that old 'French and Saunders' romp 'me likey! look alikey!') and then oops! we have fallen into the carriage.An attempt has been made toward our person.Of course, no such thing in the affair called biography-must-show-integrity has the melodramatic accuracy exemplified by the film, but who gives a damn if the historic Albert was never involved in such a thing, since one can please the masses with such a dramatic pinnacle!That slow-mo pinnacle condemns the film as a hoax, if not as the perennial ass-kissing aspiration to a monarchy we never witnessed, let alone had.The film is a stately nuanced execution, but in a mocking manner, of what the philosopher Hegel, upon witnessing Napoleon passing on his horse, said: that he saw the State passing. If only we had that kind of awe-inspiring effect ensured by a film. But it seems the sensibility we get is like the one John Waters attacked in 'Serial Mom', in the scene where the inane viewer goes for one more round of John Huston's 'Annie'. Do you want to be polished, but still corny, albeit with a royal alibi? Is no good.",Null,1,1,7 April 2010
Salt," The mind taps twice for salt
","Alright, the summary is actually a verse. Does it actually explain anything about the film? No. Perhaps yes. Perhaps perhaps.Oh, I feel so amused, because this must be one of the best examples I know of brain-washing, ridiculously shifting build-up films. But to what purpose? Can there be such a thing as ambiguous nihilism? Salt is practically mute all the time, so we can not really empathize with what she goes through (although arguably Jolie is at her best here), or what motives there are, if any, because to empathize one has to speak. And when Salt speaks, it is mostly to herself, via flash-backs, that have no actual relief, in the double sense of the word, if one has to talk about double things, since double things, well, semi-happen on screen...So, if you go for amazing, senseless build-ups, go for it. I won't ask your motive. I didn't have the time to ask myself, since I enjoy it when a director can pick any material and give it some kind of verisimilitude even if it is outrageously far-fetched (as here) but by the end, I was somehow, not pleasingly, exhausted. I recognized the promise of a sequel, that, despite the fact whether I have enjoyed the film or not I find it amusing when it happens, but this time there was some kind of ashen taste in my mouth. Jolie's exploitation of her mega-star status is the ongoing thrust of her movies, but she must resolve what kind of agent she is: super-modern-matriarch, star-on-the-cube, or relentless philanthropist? There is something unforgivably stern in her act.",Null,1,4,30 August 2010
The White Ribbon," Allegorizing Haneke
","'The White Band' explains its title in a scene where the local priest's children, after supposedly having behaved sinfully, wear a band on their arms, as a remembrance of 'purity and innocence', until these two virtues are restored.But they are not. The white band, courtesy of history, that is Duke Ferdinand's assassination and the beginning of the WWI, enters the modern era, whereupon the narrator, the village's teacher, brings his narration to a stop, since, as he puts it, was thrilled by the festive prospective of his marriage to the appropriately named Eve. His voice gives in to the church choir which fills the tableau, the tableau fades, his last words being, 'I didn't see any of the villagers again.' Why did I choose these two moments? Because they are pivotal in a way; in a way, this is where complexities begin, not in a favorable way.Even if the film is not wholly allegorical, that is how fascism emerged, as the general view goes, or, more closely to the title of the film, about the loss of innocence, there are allegorical pinpoints, like Eve's name, or again the title, that come as allegorical punctuation. And that should mark a stronger point than a full-blown allegory, because it should make more antithetical our reception of the film - but this does not happen. Why? The dialogues come off tendentiously as an accumulative, oppressive endeavor, as evil's own proof and repression. I, for one, would rather think that the introduction of a certain human detail would make the inhumanity of hierarchy's representatives even more terrible, for even a national traitor has his human moments; otherwise, the thing smacks of a schematic, one-dimensional allusion, or worse of a melodramatic, unintentional bad joke as when the priest is close to tears when his son offers him the replacement for his bird in the cage. But I think, if you allow the extreme reference, this was a bad pun intended towards Hitchcock's lovebirds from 'the Birds', for Haneke has certainly has read his Hitchcock well, as most of his recent films show. There are no lovebirds in his films.And this marks another weakness of the film: the voice off narrative is a device one should avoid, as any pupil of Hitchcock should know, unless one's intention is to frustrate, but I don't see how this is handled in a profitable way in the film since we are offered scenes the narrator could not have witnessed or heard. Of course a director can change registers at will, but - and here comes the second major reference in terms of influence, or if you want dialogue - when that happens, we are somewhat dragged into Bergman's territory, as many a reviewer has pointed, but I find that this lacks cinematic merit, and certainly Bergman's graceful touch. If it is not plausible, make it graceful.But perhaps you will say lack of grace is the point. And perhaps you are right. But if grace is lacking, and be replaceable by a thorough grayness, then highlights of allegory that come as punctuation only steal both ways. To cut a long story short, you can have an allegory of repression, if repression is meant as police repression of a riot, but if it is psychologically, and more precisely, as surely Mr. Haneke intends, post-Freudian, then you can't have an allegory of it: it either seeps, breaks into the surface, bends and returns, or not. Yet 'the white ribbon' remains white throughout. It just fades out in the end. And we do not fade in in our anxiety.The film remains a good premise where it should have risen up to its promise. Mr. Haneke should stick to the amorous couple's discontents which bring obliquely and eloquently the community's discontents, as he superbly achieved it with 'the Pianist'. It seems that with a direct approach of the political he becomes literal, and not to the letter.",Null,1,4,4 November 2009
The Butterfly Effect," The Impossible, the Real
","The film starts on a gruesome tone: we see a bunch of closely related kids acting out childhood's free violence, seething with repressed feelings; add to that a deleted in the protagonist's mind - who plays out the film - but obviously pedophile scene, and those sickening more than mysterious black-outs the protagonist, Evan, suffers. A big part of the film's first hour has a numbing effect, the numbing effect I associate with suspense when mismanaged as a sub-species of dread. (This happens in a lot of films, and I think is a serious flaw when let's say it does not come in the Hammer self-conscious tradition, or in b-movies, you know, dread with some tongue-in-cheek humor mixed in).Intriguingly enough the tone changes after Evan has his first breakthrough - to call it that - in visiting his past and altering the events his black-outs shrouded: now, instead of being a shy, bit nerd college student, is wearing the clothes of an a-male student, all testosterone, Greek alphabet community AND he also has the girl of his childhood and dreams. But the bad brother of hers we witnessed early on, and the responsible for many of the kids' troubles, re-enters the frame. And here things start to get interesting.No matter what Evan does, the roller-coaster of memories, facts and rehabilitation of traumas he embarks on is always out of complete control: no matter what he does, there is always a little left-over that troubles things and arguably makes matters worse, and that little piece always sneaking out, always being a left-over, is nothing else but the Real, courtesy of lacanian psychoanalysis. It actually fits one of the possible definitions of that hard to grasp thing: the Real is the Impossible. It is crucial here to differentiate reality, what we call everyday reality, from the Real: the Real is that hard kernel Evan is about and is always left out from our everyday, symbolic reality, governed by rules, laws, language. And the film is a good vehicle to illustrate that.It is also a good vehicle against the kind of rehabilitation books like 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' try to establish; some time back, its author, invited by Oprah Winfrey on her show, proposed the theory that no matter how traumatic an event can be, we can really go back and visit it and alter it! A participant agreed to be put to the test via hypnosis, and was relieved afterwards because she could finally go back and visit a traumatic scene with her father, change it, and forgive her father, and live happily ever after. So, to repeat the ridicule of this phenomenon by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek: if the primordial scene (that is the scene none of us could have witnessed, and yet the one that is the playground, to put it that way, of our fantasies, the scene of parental intercourse for our conception) is too traumatic, why, you can always alter it: you can have mother knitting, and father reading his newspaper...So, to go back to the film: after the first dramatic change of events, by revisiting the past and changing all that, I think it shrewdly ridicules the standardization of American healthiness: if you can have mom knitting and father reading his newspaper instead of some dramatic event, why, then you can have the girl of your dreams, power over new weaklings, AND be an a-male. Not even 'Heathers' have accomplished it so ferociously. And subtly.From then on, the film spins into ever more pessimistic loops, and Evan finally has to confront his madness, the madness of always trying to alter events - by acting them out, finally. No wonder this tactic, if Evan - or we, for that matter - wants to clean the slate clean, has to start by sweeping clean all preconceptions of the love-object, of any kind of 'intimate' knowledge we have of the other.No wonder also, when that happens, when he actually tells Kayleigh about all those alternate 'universes' he has knowledge of and of 'her' past, she is a beat-down love-object who has to reject him: telling her that he saved her from molestation in that other universe, but not from evil-doings in this one, is a male fantasy that appropriately disgusts her. There is always a distance from fantasy and guilt to where the other stands, and makes finally desire operative.This is I think where the film fails. Apparently there are four versions for ending this film, the three alternate coming with the DVD. The director's cut ending is gruesome and stupid: baby Evan 'revisits' its birth and strangles itself, as if the loop of guilt has to strangle itself in the end. The open ending is a slight variant of the end appearing in the theatrical version, that is Evan hesitates but follows her. But if there was an instance where the happy ending would be totally legitimate is this happy ending: he goes over and asks her out! Why didn't they choose this? It makes perfect sense. When I mentioned before her run-down 'version' as an amorous object, there is something crucial that also happens the first time Evan visits Kayleigh as a young man: she may be in difficult situations, yet she asserts herself and her desire, while he does not, as if he was always entrapped in the vicious circle of sacrifice and redemption, so he cannot face her, because this would arguably endanger her. This is all very fine, tuned to the Immaculate Lady theme of the Trobadours, but our semi-hero Evan has still to know what love is: as it is he remains frail as a butterfly, without fully assuming the chaotic power of love.",Null,0,2,15 November 2010
Twilight," What happened to 1001 comments?
","This is going to be deadly serious. Like, in 1001 nights Scheherazade cuts her narrative before dawn, responding to the restrictive threat of the khalif, you know, about cutting her head, and that saves her. Here, we have a film threatened to be cut by a kiss, for some nights at least. A kiss that automatically is much more, it spills out of its frame and threatens and treats us on the verge of becoming a bloodbath, Edward eating up his girlfriend and the rest, but none of this, thankfully, happens. Thankfully? Some reviewers, and I am on the verge of agreeing with them, say that this heats up, rewinds us back to classic Hollywood where a kiss was not just a kiss, and the consummation was invested, well, in our investment. That is totally different from identification with questioning what shall one do and the appended titillation, coming back and forth the on screen proceedings and the viewer you know, like totally.This is going to be deadly serious I wrote. I wish it was undeadly serious. Like (I love this American like, it's not at all, like, Brit) seriously Robert Pattinson is the most gorgeous thing of all times, and if not all times surely since 1918! That is all times can give best, and it certainly happens on screen. Off screen, well, there is where problems begin, because, you know, one is a viewer of this film, he is not embedded, if I may say so, into the action. And this is the merit of a film, I deem (excuse me if I sound from another era regarding my diction, I am actually from another country, but well, nowadays that is the same anachronism). Its merit is the fact that our gaze has to participate, and if not be undercut by it, then palpitate in that sort of film. What sort one may ask. Let's pin it down. Is it unrequited love? Frustrated love? High-school, aids-era, neo-puritan, plain girly, gay overtones one, etc? None of the above. It's not an etc. love either.The question is: is this all about love? No. Just, plainly, bluntly, no. Why? For love to emerge, there must be three. As I said, I am going to be deadly serious.Edward and Bella fall in - what? He is a vampire, she a mortal. There seems to be an incomensurability. An incomensurability boils. Not just down to 'I am afraid I will eat you', not just screaming after just recovering 'don't go, don't leave me etc'. It is not about plausibility. It is not about her (her, the woman being the object of desire) being paler than death, in every respect, so that one can overwhelm his identification with death, or anemia, or loving one who suffers, as she wisely introduces herself in the beginning, that makes one more plausible, as if love was a question of plausibility. I think one can insist enough on this. The thing is that there must be a third party to make it implausible, and thus redeem it like love. Movies purportedly insist, in matters of love, on someone frustrating the couple, and likewise foregrounding it to become one. Love and death is not enough, when it is, as it was an internal question. Otherwise, as many viewers pointed, and I insist on the word viewer, the film is spent in gazes, in the film. And not outside it, namely the viewer.One likes Hitchcock, one likes film noir, another likes blockbusters where there is some suspense because someone intervenes. No one intervenes here, albeit with side glances. But one cannot build up a film or love with glances and glances, hither and thither: video-clip ones, borrowed and burrowed here and there, stylistically speaking. I mean, I know there is a verve to something in this commentary, no? I was a high-school girl once? No. But everybody is one. Everyone ends up a female impersonator. And this film, with so many women in the production, is a sad example of this.To resume. The narrative is thrift-spent in many stylistic devices as if it would titillate the viewers. It is not amusing, it is not disorienting, it is not in-between. That makes three? No. It makes a semblance of three. And it does not make sense. Or truth.Put a teacher while the high-school student reads, put a fighter of the vampires outside their circle, not enclose the circle with vampires of a different clan. We all are of a different clan. Put a one-line that has to do with one line, put an adolescent - but you already did that in the film, early on, where the infatuation begins, before we begin to bother. We don't identify? You don't identify with us. That's the democratic vampire speaking. No, the suspense-loving vampire one, the loving-loving vampire speaking suspense. Please don't identify with us. Are you male? Are you female? Are you undead? For, surely, you can't be dead. Are you a dead one reading these lines? Then probably you've drank all the wines...But I'm on a special diet.",Null,0,0,19 November 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The beard jewelery is amazing!

P.S. I Love You," An earjerker, rather than a tearjerker
","The life of a chick flick is hard in the post 'Sex and the City' world: it is rather on the chick than on the chic side, unless we are talking about the chic commodities that at a certain point start stalking, to the detriment of people who are feeling un-chicly constrained. I mention this because the creative urge that appears in Holly, namely the creation of her own line of shoes in the end comes off like an advertisement, and not like, say, a scene where we witness her enjoying her work. I think this is crucial, because that would mean that we are witnessing the work of real mourning, not the work of a real product.For the film, paved with good intentions (the French say that hell is paved with good intentions) smells like a product in the end. The 'Sex and the City' vein was not brought in vain, if you will; and not for a trivial aspect. Combine this with another hit of the era, 'Friends'; Lisa Kudrow does not appear here for nothing (unless one takes the reenactment of her usual persona as nothing); she is here for her usual brand of ludicrous, I would dare say dangerous, concoction of cynical-deadpan-slightly hurt female that comes of like some sort of absent-minded sprite, and is usually employed for releasing some tension. For this, as the film informs us, is a case of love and loss.Who would want to lose Gerard Butler? He has an irresistible and subtle charm, above the average jolly Irishman consensus. Why is it that he is so popular? He portrays something of a really contemporary masculinity. Sargent, the 19th century painter, notes that a portrait is a picture where there is something wrong with the mouth. Look how twisted, boyish, wrong his mouth is at times; perhaps this is why.Then, as soon as the two actors appear on screen, you cannot but wonder, even if it is for just a moment, if they actually match. At first it seemed to me awkward-but-why-not, then it shone on me: this actually begins like a gay movie. I am serious. Bette Davies, Judy Garland, gay club??? The climax of these three things in a widow's circumstances is blatant! Then I thought that even casting the of 'Boys don't cry' reputation Hilary Swank, was taken into consideration by the producers. For I agree with some of the reviews here: she is not a terrific actor, and she lacks the charm the role should have been fleshed out with. Is it the strong jaws, the boyish looks? And then the gist of it. How long could one go on sending letters from the grave, and how should he/she handle it? Here I think that the people involved in the scenario should have seriously thought what a letter actually is. At the point Holly visits Ireland after Gerry has arranged for it and she falls for a singer named William who goes on to unfortunately perform a song Gerry did perform for her, and she goes out in the street in panic, she asks a central question: why is he doing this? why does he want me to remember? it is cruel. The funny thing is this is the one instance it is not prearranged. So why this misplaced judgment? It is just that at that one coincidence the cruelty of memory arises in full gear, without prearrangements. Gerry actually is not cruel, he is humiliating. One cannot consider in advance another's mourning, so the whole endeavor, coming full circle at the end in the figure of the mother, seems like narcissistically motivated. Gerry is excruciating in his letters because it is actually about him mourning himself via another person. In no instance does he mention why he is writing the letters, what's in there for him. I would definitely say to a beloved, I am writing to you because I just want to talk to you and going on talking to you (and not decidedly help you get over me!). Wouldn't you? But one should have known better: love is not a mellow post-scriptum; it is written in the course of things.",Null,1,1,30 January 2010
Clash of the Titans," 'Release the Cracken!'
","Excuse me?! Well, just for this one, it wins - as long as longevity in memory is not ensured; one expects in that kind of fare some, well, inaccuracies concerning the mythical elements, but this badness becomes mythical on its own ground.But poor Cracken is so easily slain in the end, compared to other monsters in the same movie that, along being anti-climactic, one gets a whiff of suspicion that the Cracken stands for the plot. Wouldn't it be better to assume the guts to release some plot? Mr. Worthington still entertains a charming dilemma: is he just buff or actually an actor? I'm afraid the film is not revelatory on this matter, but his role was in need of some charisma, but charisma is also what the - oh, my gosh!!! what is this thing released turning Io's (quite, quite unnecessary) presence into a mullet-faced piece of immortality the ever-so-mannered, if not repressed, Fiennes into a self-parody, and perhaps a revenge of the English accent's netherworld upon the American Zeus' nuanced truck-driver laconic deliverance and oh! each time one had to hear 'Zeus!' as something between juice, Jews, zoos and Jesus - what an embarrassment! bad, smoky, in-the-last minute 3-D the maniacal, hilarious bony and quite, quite Greek sage collapsing representations between gurus and, uh, what did the Greeks have, man (but I actually like it as an ideological critique of western spirituality: not the blind, epicene, political figure of the ancient seer as in Pasolini's Oedipus, but a doom-eager caricature of Buddist import) bla bla bla long live the Cash of the Titans!",Null,0,0,7 April 2010
Avatar," I wonder as I wander, or the other way round?
","I would like to ask a question: is there someone in the audience who witnessed the first coming of 3D in the sixties? I would really like to read some reactions from adults back then. (Not just for the sake of comparisons, technological or others. I am not even sure if it is cultural the same way, cultural differences aside.)It surely is sweeping. It is mind-numbing in a way, or more ways if you will. Yet the audience reacted in a strange way, I mean the audience from Athens, Greece, where I saw the film, 3D and all, and this is what I would like to share, since everybody will make his own experience on watching the film, and then will react to the reviews. So, this is it: let's say that the film risks to get short-circuited into an allegory of a choice between the 'real' and a virtual reality, with the hero switching between 'bodies', like in a game, as some detractors would probably say. My question was: when the point comes, for it was galloping towards us in the climax, will the hero choose his invalid body and thus validate his existence as a hero, or regress to the virtual realm and as such deliver us to the deadlock of a fantasy world? Although this remains unresolved in a way at the end, even titillating us with the promise of a sequel, and here I go back to the bizarre reaction from the audience, are we sure we want to go to the end of our fantasy world? It surely is entertaining, but is it all the way?When Neytiri saves Jake Sully from suffocation, and they, then, just before the end, meet for the first time 'as they really are', the audience burst out laughing, as if this was gruesome and incongruous for the sake of the love story. As if everything else in the story could be awesome, or agenda-ridden, but not what happens between a male and a female, even though, well, they are of a different species. It reminded me of a TV ad that appeared some years now - girl wanders in the woods, encounters a frog, kisses frog, frog becomes prince, prince looks somewhat dubiously girl, kisses girl, girl becomes beer, he drinks beer. You guessed it, the ad was for a beer. So, the question I would like to pose is: what does a beer taste like on Pandora, is the gist of the film?Please tell me.Open my eyes.",10,20,36,16 December 2009
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray is an algorithm!
","'In mathematics an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function.[...] In simple words an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations.' That is the definition of an algorithm, and Bill fills the bill for what acting is! Step-by-step procedure of calculations, considering a state of repetition? This is a unique performance, and it seems so effortless! I wish I could say the same for McDowell. She seems a bit less of a worthy amorous object in the film, she has that watermarked quality that here stands for evanescence. I do not know if this works in 'Groundhog Day'.It is also that the scenario, now that I have watched the film for the third time - not enough! - as the film progresses, to call it that, has some kind of Reader's Digest sense of what repetition is when one takes into account the clichés that seem not so effortless, or organic, as it goes on towards the end. It is as though the conclusion as it moves along has some feel-good undercurrent that comes precipitated in a way; some have talked about the crudity of the direction. Yes, I can sense that. But it would be that one wants a certain sense of subtlety which would mean another film. And I do not want another film! I do not even want another sense of repetition!

But even if Odin is some sort of ghost - Hamlet the father, would you trust Hopkins to be the part? Or Skarsgaard to partake in that mannerism that characterizes both, and alleviate the comic character when in-jokes happen concerning his Scandinavian character? I wouldn't think so.Is Nathalie Portman the new Ophelia? Let me laugh with her whining, lame voice. This is absurd and just plain unconvincing. She has no sense at all of what being in a comic is; she tries to redeem it by being totally thrown off (well, she tries?).Hemsworth is juicy - just for a glimpse, and what is being a god, or a mortal, or a in-between state, let me yawn.The side-effects, to call them that, were good. But that is all.Why has it got to be so unimaginative? Why? Some cuts were really atrocious, as if we could all take in the comic thrust of it all. But no, just plain no.",Null,0,1,28 August 2011
Inception," Let's tax the exclamation marks
","For someone used to - literally - jack-in-the-box (to joker-in-the-box) films, Nolan is peculiarly, inhumanly humorless. And for people - one hopes - with cinematic experience, as some of us are, he must be the industry's greatest fraud, for his films suffer from a complete innate lack of what filmic composition, rhythm, angle, and framing is: the guy is unable to truly engage the gaze; instead, he tries to compensate this lack with solipsistic gimmicks, cold and badly informed. Ah, so many people rave for the intricacies of the plot and the ingenuity of the creator while what they actually do is congratulate themselves for being clever. Has any of them people read any serious stuff on dreams, on the technology of the brain? Freud, lacanian psychoanalysis? Apparently not. What shows it? Exactly this. Show against tell in this case fails: too much blah blah monopolizes the screen and obfuscates any sense of build-up, suggestion, mood, nightmarish entanglements, or what you will, unless one goes for cardboard intensities. And one may say that 'the Matrix', as this film is so easily compared to, may be called a film of pseudo- or not philosophical aspirations with cardboard intensities, but, at least the first one had the zest to be Baudrillard for cheerleaders.When Hemingway just beginning went to visit the catalyst called Gertrude Stein and showed her some of his writings, she told him this: Description is not literature. Hemingway, begin allover again, and be concentrated.What she meant by this was too much description is not what makes literature literature. I would transcribe it into too much talking in a film does not make it a filmic experience, which goes us back to show me against tell me, more so for telling being in this case explaining away and exhaustingly pap the actors are oddly embarrassed to pronounce, as if unable to find the proper stance.Relentless subterfuge, said the critic Armond White, is what characterizes this film. I would add that this does not signify cinematic enjoyment, but rather too much sound and fury that struts and frets its hours upon the screen, let alone shaping aesthetic subjects.I was glad to discover that the audience, in the provincial cinema in Crete where I saw it, of college boys and girls booed the family reunion pap in the end, and the supposedly grand question one is left with, as if they recognized the film's serious lack of spin, if you know what I mean.PS Kubrick, you said? That is mistaking a rabbi for a mere technician. Supreme juggling? Juggling is all about transforming mechanics into gusto. This does not happen in the film. Rip offs and then rip offs, is the film's offering: the way the children are filmed is an exact copy paste from Roegg's 'Don't look now,' and the dream-within-dream expansion of time is a footnote to Antonioni's procedure in 'Blow up,' to add an example or two. Steal and integrate in what you do what you will, I am perfectly OK with that, however botched your creation is. But if you are informed by a rip-off sensibility, your final creation won't even be Frankenstein's monster, but its stitches.",Null,12,20,27 August 2010
Mary and Max," A sad and true account of how a rencontre fails
","This feature is an off-beat, extremely sad and joyful elegy and an incarnation of the unlived life and an account of the failed encounter with the other.Here I deliberately draw on the theories of Jacques Lacan, the french psychoanalyst, who said that every achieved encounter of two persons, is a failed one. This does not mean that they do not happen, just that a disastrous moment occurs, and amends are, or not, made.In the film, after almost twenty years of pen-friendship, the two, at first by a perfect whim of chance-choice and then by a perfect giving-and-misgiving course of things, where the two protagonists are never mischievous between them, even when things go bad and hilarious for them and for their relationship, finally meet in person, and Max is found dead by Mary. It sounds grim, but in the end it's, not quite uplifting, unless it is for the gaze which reads Mary's letters on the ceiling. That is the moment amends are made, even if they involve just Mary.Attention to the whimsy of detail is intimate, almost saturating. As with the constant field of reality we encounter every day with its seams of unabashed humor and unapologetic banality. The choice of stop-motion is dead on, as if the clayness of the matter was the best vehicle of their, and, as it goes, our situation.",7,1,10,28 December 2009
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas, Loud Atlas, Shrugged Atlas
","To have a tattoo-like comet on your buttock (how gay, my!) or on your clavicle (how sensitive!) or on your scalp (uh, was that a reference to the 1983 'Yellowbeard' with the map tattooed on a scalp?), to have a series of this mark or of nosy noses seems to be the lucid moral of what history is about (did I say history? how insensitive of me, failing to face the cosmic grandeur that connects us all!). I enjoy a good old predestination drama and an open-ended, blooming melodrama equally, but this film is just awful; it is six bad films for the price - a very big price for a loud film that falls allover the place and ultimately marries opportunism with cynicism despite its revolutionary crap because its mantra is 'our lives are not our own' - in the look-how-small-you-are-in-the-divine-proportions-space-and-time-wise (although you can be a revolutionary leader later turned into a religious figure) dimension that makes one's heart blink in astonishment and humble recognition.Did Ayn Rand turn into the three-headed monster of the directors using the greatest box office star of all time Tom Hanks and the lame Hail Razzie Hale Berry to promulgate History as a series of unfortunate make-up (if you excuse the reference to 'Lemony Sniket')? But maybe one should return to 'Yellowbeard', whose protagonist recalls the steps to his buried treasure saying the great line 'Stagger, Stagger, Crawl, Crawl' in reference to the injured state he was in when he hid the treasure, in one of the underrated films of sublime bad taste. Only here those involved in the film do not recognize how they stagger or crawl or their injured state. How serious and heartwarming it all is.",Null,0,1,11 January 2013
