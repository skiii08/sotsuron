Skyfall," This one's got it all!
","This film's got it all, a story, fighting, drama, great and unbelievable actors..! Only a little short on the bedroom action. The link is being made between the more 'hollywoodish' action movies, that Bond's had become, and the old, real Bond. A new start for proper British spying and action. With hardly any technological progress and even a little decay, 007 is back! The cast couldn't have been better, Daniel Craig, but also the new 'bad guy' Javier Bardem play their parts beautifully. But in my opinion a movie does not only rely on its main characters, but even more on the actors in more modest roles. In this movie I'd like to point out the almost perfect acting of Judy Dench, Ralph Fiennes (yes, Voldemort) and Albert Finney! After all a true true Bond, and as i see it: a new beginning! Kudo's to the whole crew!",10,4,20,31 October 2012
