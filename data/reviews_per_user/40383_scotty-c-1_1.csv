Alien 3," What the hell went wrong?
","After watching the first two Alien films and thoroughly enjoying them I decided to watch Alien 3 for the first time, it was the special edition version not the theatrical version and I've got to say im really disappointed. About halfway through the film I found myself annoyed and bored to be honest. Considering the first two films and Prometheus kept me on the edge of my seat it begs the question, what the hell went wrong???I thought Weaver and Dance were fantastic but the story was garbage, their performances weren't enough to keep me entertained throughout this disjointed mess. I was baffled as to why they felt the need to kill off 3 of the main characters at the beginning. The bad CGI was really off putting, it was terrible in fact considering ghostbusters (1984) had better effects despite having a much lower budget and coming out 8 years prior. This film felt really rushed to me and half completed.I can't help but wonder what Scott or Cameron's version on Alien 3 would of turned out like. These are just my opinions but looking at the ratings of the first two Alien films compared to this I get the feeling I'm not the only one that was left disappointed. About the watch Alien: Resurrection now, I really hope this isn't a case of superman all over again. 2 fantastic films followed by 2 god awful films. Wish me luck",5,2,4,12 February 2017
