The Blair Witch Project," Waste of money
","The worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema. Absolutely not scary, just boring! A group of stupid city-kids go astray in a forest, because they couldn't use a map and a compass and didn't know anything about GPS or mobile phones. There is absolutly nothing to see or to hear in this movie wich scares someone who knows the sounds of a forest by night and who was in the wilderness once before. After 30 minutes of this awfull movie I get some headache because of the shaking pictures from the videocam.",1,22,44,28 April 2001
Minority Report," Nice but not above average
","I just saw Minority Report and I think it's a nice movie, but not more. The idea of the movie is quite interesting, but the special effects, the action and also the storyline is only average. I really expected more then this from a Steven Spielberg movie.",5,1,2,1 October 2002
