Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Before Watching: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)
","'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' (2011) is the second Sherlock Holmes-movie, and quite extravagant. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows takes up its plot from where the prequel left off but is also somewhat independent. The major benefit from watching the previous instalment is the character relationships, not so much the underlying plot, which is explained thoroughly within the movie. Depending on the taste of the viewer, this added depth could be both trivial and the whole difference, but it would be subjectively recommended.In terms of contest, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows takes a slightly different approach than what the first movie established. Here, the mystery is slightly changed into a cat and mouse thriller, even though the characteristic clue hunting remains. The stakes are higher and feel more real, and the action is elevated to a substantially new level. The antagonist is well written and more menacing, the scenery is dynamic, and the relationship between Holmes and Watson continues to blossom for added highs and lows. There is also a noticeable growth in the character developments, especially in Holmes, which is very refreshing and touching.That is not to say this movie is without flaws. Depending on one's taste and interest, the beginning can feel quite slow with a stag party, wedding, and conversations around those events. Now, things surely happen, but it is still delaying the beginning of the real conflict. There is also a certain escape scene which is very stylized and can certainly be perceived as over the top.All in all, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is thrilling, exciting, and very well done. It is a great sequel which flows straight of its predecessor, and ends in a climactic yet poignant crescendo.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

Your Name.," Before Watching: Your Name / Kimi no na wa (2016)
","'Your Name' (2016) is an anime about love, Japanese culture, and... body-swapping? It is great, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie requires a few things from you as a viewer, although mainly in two different ways. The first half spends most of it's time in a Japanese village, where certain traditions, rituals and items are presented - such as Kuchikamizake and the concept of braiding and twilight. The more insight one has about these things, the more complete do they seem inside the plot, as their themes correlate exquisitely to the movie's main theme. The movie is nevertheless highly enjoyable without above-average knowledge about these things.The second half goes pretty plot-heavy. This is where attention to the first half pays off, as the complexity opens a whole different layer of emotional and intellectual satisfaction. Don't stress if you don't get everything at once, instead rejoice over a great film that rewards you for additional viewings. With Your Name, you don't pay attention - you invest it.A small footnote that should be mentioned is that some of the humor is a bit over-the-top adolescent, and there are a few jokes about breasts and crotch areas. Sensitive watchers might find this a bit annoying, but it could also be argued that it plays well into the charms of the movie.Last but certainly not least, this movie is breathtakingly gorgeous. The shots are pure bliss and the beauty presented is all too rare. The light, colors, and surroundings beg for as many inches of a screen as you can get hold of. If you don't own a Blu-ray player, movies like this makes the price worth it.My personal grade: a phenomenal 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",8,0,1,29 July 2019
Catch Me If You Can," Before Watching: Catch Me If You Can (2002)
","'Catch Me If You Can' (2002) is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. and the chase between him and an FBI agent. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Catch Me If You Can showcases a lot of interesting intrigues as the plot develops and turns into a cat-and-mouse chase. The pacing is well done as are the relationships between the characters, which rarely feels over the top even when the situations at time are somewhat absurd. The movie never feels unbelievable in that sense, and its optimistic and genuine tone - together with great performances from both DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken - makes for a thrilling and exciting joyride with a rewarding finale.However, this movie is not without potential downsides. Women are frequently depicted as sex objects and are rarely given any other character depth. Secondly, there are some details, expressions and institutions in the movie that can be confusing at first, especially for non-Americans.Nevertheless, Catch Me If You Can are fun, cheeky and captivating. It is fairly light at a first glance, but there are deeper themes that makes this movie enjoyable for a wide audience.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

Raiders of the Lost Ark," Before Watching: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981) is undoubtedly an iconic adventure classic. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Raiders of the Lost Ark is a thrill ride, but some aspects leave a few things to be wanted. The editing during the movie's first half can be a bit choppy at times, and a few plot details throughout the film are somewhat illogical. The villains are quite one-dimensional, and a certain sequence has a very clear use of greenscreen as well. The more of a nitpicker one is, the more this will be bothering, but all aspects named can be overlooked with any major effort.A warning should however be issued to those who are sensitive to blood and gruesome effects. The opening feature some stark images in this category, there is a shoot-out scene early on that doesn't shy away from this either, and the infamous ending is surprisingly brutal and gory when compared to the overall lighter mood of the movie. It has currently a PG rating, but a PG-13 rating would be more appropriate as the violence alone pushes the movie into R areas at said times.Finally, the iconic status of Raiders of the Lost Ark derives mostly from its cult position as well as its 80's nostalgia. At the time, this was clearly groundbreaking in most of its areas, but today, its technical features are matched more and more often within the genre. Nevertheless, Indiana Jones' charisma still hits home, and ultimately, the portrayed adventures has maintained their excitements. Don't rush into to the following sequel at the cost of appreciating this one, as Temple of Doom fails drastically to deliver entertainment of the same level.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

Finding Nemo," Before Watching: Finding Nemo (2003)
","'Finding Nemo' (2003) is a fine animation classic for the whole family. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:There is not too much that needs to be pre-known about Finding Nemo. At the surface, it serves a captivating story that has the power to spellbind its younger audience. A few scenes might be unsettling, those include the opening, Nemo's attempts in the aquarium, and in the introduction of the character Darla.This movie isn't just for youngsters, however. Older viewers are in for a delight as well, as there are a lot of references and great underlying themes as Pixar usually provides. Be sure to be open for the mature side and enjoy its rich content.My personal grade: a floating 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",7,0,0,12 August 2019
Terminator Salvation," Before Watching: Terminator Salvation (2009)
","'Terminator Salvation' (2009) is the fourth installment in the Terminator franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Terminator Salvation immediately raises the question: 'is this the worthy continuation to Terminator 2 that Terminator 3 surely as not?' The answer is, sorry to say, a no.Speaking in terms of quality, Terminator Salvation is quite strong. The effects are nice, the scenery is beautiful at times, and small inventive things can be found to further expand the Terminator universe. The consequences feel more real than earlier, the action is even thrilling, and you care more for the characters again. As a standalone film, Terminator Salvation isn't really that bad and can be enjoyable.However, fans of the Terminator will immediately find issues, mostly in terms of plot consistency for the franchise. With this movie, we enter the iconic Skynet-controlled Los Angeles, a time we've only seen before in Kyle Reese's flashbacks from The Terminator, only to find that they don't match the present. There are indeed a few years between Terminator Salvation and said flashbacks, but the difference seems too big to compromise the two timelines. This isn't really a major detail, but for those who place weight on these details, it will be distracting.As for the canon, Terminator Salvation doesn't contribute too much of additional information or insight. It can be skipped as a part of the franchise, but again, as a standalone film - and as a way to explore the Terminator concept - it is really not that bad.My personal grade: a moderate 6/10.

The Terminator," Before Watching: The Terminator (1984)
","'The Terminator' (1984) or just 'Terminator' is a classic sci-fi movie as well as the start of the sci-fi saga with the same name. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Terminator is a pure 80's movie. It includes action elements like guns, explosions and shootings, together with some rock-hard testosterone from Schwarzenegger himself. The score is superb, being a mixture of analogue synths together with futuristic sound effects. The special effects and stop motion are quite obviously from the 80's as well, being a bit premature yet not too clunky. All in all - very 80's straight through, and it has in this aspect very similar vibes to Aliens and Die Hard.However, Terminator also features very human elements and feelings. Relationships feel real, and although crude language and nudity occur, the atmosphere is surprisingly cozy in-between the action. Perhaps due to the strong 80's vibe and subsequent nostalgia, yet in this aspect it is the strongest entry in the franchise. The time travel paradoxes don't stumble but flow smoothly in the narrative, although it will still require some attention.A slight in-depth note: a few viewers might wonder why Terminator sometimes isn't as accurate of a shooter as you would expect a computer to be. One plausible explanation could be that, according to the movie, the technological advancements stopped or slowed down considerably in 1997 when the war began. If the CPU in Terminator is on roughly the same level, perhaps some calculations for bullet trajectories could struggle to be calculated and executed in real-time.Conclusively - Terminator is a great gem in both being an entertaining and human sci-fi, as well as being a prime demonstration on the topmost shape of 80's movies. Now, go and see Terminator 2 - Judgment Day.My personal grade: an electrifying 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",9,0,2,14 September 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Before Watching: Dr. Strangelove (1964)
","'Dr. Strangelove' (1964) is an iconic satire about the consequences of nuclear war and arms race. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:It is important to remember that Dr. Strangelove is a movie from 1964 and was thereby released soon after the culmination of the Cuba Crisis two years earlier. At its face value, it is a slow-burning feature filled with a unique, dark and time-stamped humor when all things are considered. Expect a lot of dialogue with over-the-top patriotism and prejudice against communists, with a few scenes and conversations sprinkled with a hint of sexuality.Going deeper into the movie however, this was a very real threat that was closer to explode than what most people think, and it that light, Dr. Strangelove is... quite something. Some will find it tedious with clumsy special effects, and other will find it an intriguing reflection of a tense era, capsulated in an hour and a half.My personal grade: a peculiar 6/10.

The Bourne Ultimatum," Before Watching: The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)
","'The Bourne Ultimatum' (2007) is the third (and for some final) installment in the Bourne franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie plays straight off its predecessor, The Bourne Supremacy. As a result, it is highly recommendable to watch those movies close together, more so between The Bourne Identity and Supremacy. A lot of events during the first half of The Bourne Ultimatum makes a lot more sense if one can remember the ending of the previous one.The editing in this movie is quicker than in the previous ones, with an average shot length of about 2.5 seconds. A trick to avoid getting confused and nauseous (especially during the fighting scenes) is to aim one's attention in the middle of the screen, as Greengrass does an excellent job of focusing on the things that matter in every moment in this way. It produces a very interesting and enjoyable effect, as we experience things the same way as Jason Bourne with these and other shots.Finally, The Bourne Ultimatum provides a very satisfying resolution to the series. There should be no need to rush to the two sequels, The Bourne Legacy and Jason Bourne, as they never reach the level of the first movies. For me personally, I view this franchise as complete with The Bourne Ultimatum.My personal grade: a pumping 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",8,0,0,29 July 2019
The Bourne Identity," Before Watching: The Bourne Identity (2002)
","'The Bourne Identity' (2002) is the first installment in the famous Bourne-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Some attention needs to be paid to the minor characters, especially the different assassins. The more you understand and get from the first half, the more sense the second half will make.The Bourne Identity has a bit of everything - tension, sensuality and surely violence. Neither part, however, is overly prominent (except perhaps the violence in the third act), to the degree where it is detracting from the overall story and characters. The focus stays steady, and the tone doesn't shift very much throughout the runtime. Not a lot else needs to be said - prepare for a thrilling dive into one of the greatest action movies of the 2000s.My overall grade: 8/10.",8,4,4,15 July 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Before Watching: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)
","'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' (2003) is the third movie in the Terminator franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Absolutely first of all: sorry to say, but this movie is far away from the quality of the first and second Terminator. If you hold them dear, think twice whether you really want to see this movie. If you still do, keep reading.Terminator 3 aims for the same level of action extravaganza that Terminator 2 had, and while it doesn't reach quite the same height, some scenes are fairly thrilling and can certainly satisfy cravings for guns and explosions. However, that is about the only positive aspect of Terminator 3, as the rest of the movie doesn't come close to the same cinematography, special effects, characters or emotions as the previous installments. It is all over the place.The most disappointing downside is the lack of charisma. John Connor in Terminator 2 has now become a homeless, college drop-out burglar who is roaming shops for some easy booze and painkillers. The new Terminator is a very sexualized femme fatale whose liquid metal body can fire laser rockets. The other protagonist, Kate, is mainly there to ask questions and push the narrative forward, and our beloved Schwarzenegger does his best in trying to live up to his former glory. Terminator 3 is very much like any other action movie from the early 00's, and suffers from uncharismatic characters with very small arcs and very little dynamic.Nevertheless, the action is acceptable. But Terminator consists of so much more.My personal grade: a displeased 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",6,1,1,14 September 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Before Watching: Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (1991)
","'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day' (1991) is the continuation of Terminator (1984) and takes time about ten years after the prequel's events. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Where Terminator explored the emotional and human spectra of a confrontation with a murder robot from the future, Terminator 2 instead ramps up the action and take it to a whole different level. It has more - more explosion and guns, more police skirmishes and more Terminators. It is a visual feast of spectacular special effects and some great sceneries that want a big screen to deliver the impact. The score with the famous theme hits home as well. Terminator 2 could easily have been released a few years back and still competed with movies of this decade, and it's crazy to think it is approaching 30 years since its release.Nevertheless, the focus on the action makes the emotional weight shrink. Terminator 2 doesn't come off as close or cozy as the first, so depending on if one prefers the emotional or spectacular side of the premise, one will also claim either the first or second Terminator movie as their favorite.A final word also about the violence - it is surprisingly brutal at times. Some scenes can be quite hard to watch, but beyond that, the movie is not more shocking or disturbing that the first. Remember to see the first Terminator movie before this one, as you will benefit greatly in terms of narrative details and appreciation of the characters.One more thing - in terms of franchise consistency, this is where the Terminator saga ends. Future installments consistency fails to deliver at this height, or doesn't follow the established canon. They can be watched as movies that explores the Terminator concept, but Terminator as a franchise ends here.My personal grade: an explosive 8/10.

Pearl Harbor," Before Watching: Pearl Harbor (Theatrical version) (2001)
","'Pearl Harbor' (2001) is a movie following two pilots and a woman during the events before, during and after Pearl Harbor. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:First, there are two versions of Pearl Harbor - the theatrical version and the Director's Cut. The Director's Cut has slightly different love scenes and a lot of added violence and gore, as well as somewhat cruder language. The Director's Cut is therefore rated R and represent more accurately the shocking brutality of warfare. Depending on the viewer and his or her relation to war violence, either could be preferable, as the violence in the theatrical version is much more scaled down. This review is of the theatrical version:Pearl Harbor may be known and labeled by some as a slow, pro-American, over-explosive and historically inaccurate war movie - sprinkled with distracting love relationships on top. These labels could be justifiable; the movie is over 3 hours long with over an hour of set-up before the actual skirmish, which does feature a lot of explosions and destruction. Throughout the runtime, Americans are depicted as strong, charismatic heroes while the enemy (whether Japanese or German) are invasive and ruthless. Added to all this is plenty of anachronisms and details which doesn't make sense nor add up, and a lot of the plot does hinge on love relationships. It is a lot of spectacle and drama, and the violence in the theatrical version can feel inaccurate. These are all valid points to criticize, but in so doing, it needs to be known that neither of these points necessarily distract unless one is pre-occupied with them. As entertainment and as a vessel to carry an important story, Pearl Harbor holds up fine. The views are shot beautifully with a nice variance of vistas, the score by Hans Zimmer is swelling and fits the movie well, and the poignant points rarely feel blunt. The actors and actresses feel genuine as well.In summary - this movie does have faults and is therefore perhaps not for everyone. Still, the less this movie is viewed as a documentary and more as an interpretation with some liberty, the more enjoyable it will become.My personal grade: an acceptable 7/10.

Inside Out," Before Watching: Inside Out (2015)
","'Inside Out' (2015) is a fantastic movie, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Despite what one might think about movies aimed towards children, this movie is quite deep. Maybe not so much as to a complex narrative, but more so towards an emotional side. It will remind you of sides of yourself you might have forgotten about, and if relating and resonating on that emotional and nostalgic level tends to bring out tears in other circumstances, you're in for another trip down that lane. Be sure to watch it with as comfortable of a surrounding as you can get, as that can allow you to embrace that side and make your watching more rewarding.That being said, this is also a kid's movie. Despite a surprisingly mature theme, it also features some humor for the younger audience that can come off as distracting depending of your acceptance of quirky characters and slapstick humor. However, Inside Out doesn't stick that side up your face enough in order for it to develop into a nuisance, unless you really dislike those types of elements (but if you do, do re-consider your choice of movie or genre as a whole).My personal grade: an emotional 8/10.

Batman Begins," Before Watching: Batman Begins (2005)
","'Batman Begins' (2005) is the first movie of The Dark Knight Trilogy, all directed by Christopher Nolan. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:At its core, Batman is a human superhero. There is no magic, alien nor mutation present, instead, he is a person whose background pushes him onto a course which leads him to fight for justice the best he can. In light of the more recent superhero movies from DC and Marvel, this take might feel a bit slow and less spectacular today, but what it lacks in terms of explosions and visual effects, Batman Begins more than makes up for in terms of dialogue, character arcs, and a superb overall mood and theme. With the weight focused on psychological depths rather than flamboyant extravaganza, it is paradoxically more than just a superhero movie, and could just as easy (and accurately) be described as a mixture between drama and thriller. If you are open for that take, this will not disappoint you the slightest.Ultimately, Batman Begins is a great movie that doesn't require any pre-knowledge about the DC universe. It stands alone in its own sphere and can be watched as a single movie or as the first part of its trilogy. It is deep, it is thrilling, and if it ever poses the slightest delight in you, don't miss out on the sequels.My personal grade: a captivating 8/10.

Before Sunset," Before Watching: Before Sunset (2004)
","'Before Sunset' (2004) is the sequel to 'Before Sunrise' (1995) and follows Jesse and Celine as they meet nine years after their first encounter. Like its predecessor, Before Sunset a romantic movie, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:As with Before Sunrise, the emotional impact and reward from this movie comes from the level of resonance one experience with the characters - more dialogue will hit home, train of thoughts will be relatable, and they will undoubtedly be more sympathetic. Audiences younger or older risk losing a lot of value and emotional satisfaction because of this very reason.An important thing to be aware about is the tone in the dialogue. Before Sunset is cruder than its the prequel, and there are frequent gags and talk about sexual subjects which can risk upsetting conservative or sensitive people, or at least detract from the overall viewing experience. The moral grounds in itself is also quite loose, as it becomes more and more apparent throughout the runtime that Jesse and Celine are tempted by the thought of leaving their current partners for each other, which doesn't feel entirely in line with the people we got to meet in the prequel. This can be perceived as quite questionable.Finally, the resolution to this movie can also by some be perceived as unrewarding, as consequences are not really dealt with as consequences, or at least one in the same way as one would expect from the prequel. It is hard to say more before giving away the plot, but before watching Before Sunset, one could benefit more from being less conservatively consequential here than in Before Sunrise. Do remember, however, that this movie impacts you depending on how much you can relate with the life situation Jesse and Celine are in, and that nothing in this review thereby can be taken as a final say.My personal grade: a disappointing 6/10.

","'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' (2019) is a fun comedy and the ninth movie of Quentin Tarantino. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Once Upon a Time is not all too similar to Tarantino's latest movies, like Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained. Instead, it is more of a cozy, atmospheric movie that doesn't rely on any dramatic plot events to carry the events forward. This brings a very authentic and charming feeling that although pure brilliant, again, isn't like the protagonist blood mayhem we've gotten somewhat used to - but it neither needs to be.That being said, there are some classical Tarantino vibes present that could shock viewers not used to his other works. There are some brief but crude sexual references, brutal violence once conflict approaches, and a lot of drinking and swearing. Thanks to the direction and construction of this movie however, it never feels forced, which lessens its potentially negative impact.Finally, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is fundamentally a comedy. It is funny, and a rather gleeful and clever way of funny. Do not take this movie 100% seriously all the time, instead just relax and drift away with the charming 50's and 60's atmosphere so expertly crafted.My personal grade: a cheerful 8/10.

","'Good Will Hunting' (1997) is an intriguing drama about guilt, life, and love.

The protagonist has very complex emotions that has expressed him downward into a negative spiral, and subsequently, the progress and resolution can be very emotionally intense on both sides of the spectrum. Matt Damon's and Robin William's both deliver good performances that makes their shared screen-time both thoughtful and enjoyable.There are, nevertheless, sides to this that has the potential to subtract from this viewing experience. There is a lot of cursing present as well as crude language, and a lot of sexual references and jokes that can offend sensitive viewers. There is also mentioning of abuse from parents, which can be another sensitive subject for some. Depending on one's attitude toward these flipsides, the movie will come across as either wonderful or a waste of potential - or as a compromise in between.My personal grade: an annoying 4/10.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie isn't as firmly attached to the earlier Bourne movies as you might think at first. It ties in at the beginning to the third movie with some characters we've seen before, but soon after continues off in its own direction without really connecting much to the earlier works. It's more or less a Bourne movie... without Bourne.Quality-wise, it does feature some similar action elements and chases, and it does get a point for inventive environments and vistas, but ultimately, it does not deliver at the same level as its predecessors. The shaky cam is very prevalent, however, which sometimes can be a bit confusing as it is not as well handled as in The Bourne Ultimatum. The ending can also come across as rather abrupt.All in all, if you are a big fan of the earlier Bourne movies, The Bourne Legacy is a rather unnecessary spin-off that does not improve on the Bourne universe and thereby feel stale and boring. In that sense, you do not need to see this movie. Otherwise, it's a fairly entertaining but very average action movie.My personal grade: a bland 6/10.

The visual effects, battles and sound design are pretty and very impressive, however, that is also where the praise stops.Transformers suffer from a lot from objective issues. There is a lot of illogical plot elements, immature teenage humor, sensuality, and flat, stereotypical characters. Mixed with an uneven pacing where certain scenes are stretching way too long, there's a big risk for audiences to feel uninterested and frustrated. The movie is at times also confusing and unclear about exactly what is going on, and certain side characters can feel inhuman and very over-the-top. The more these points are vital to one's watching experience, the more the same watcher will identify to the previously mentioned audience. This movie is clearly aimed to the younger teenagers and can likewise be perceived as cool and thrilling if one is 12, 13, or maybe even 14. Beyond that, one would need a lot of love for the franchise and forgiveness alike to enjoy the experience, especially as this level of quality doesn't improve with the sequels.My personal grade: a very average 5/10.

1917," Before Watching: 1917 (2019)
","'1917' (2019) is a stunning war drama within the frontlines of World War I. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:1917 is - as it has rightly been advertised as - a movie that's supposed to look as though it was taken in one shot. This causes an immersive experience that is very rarely found in mainstream movies, and because of this, it needs a very different approach and preparation.First thing first - the movie is absolutely gorgeous. Roger Deakins is in charge, so expect stunning cinematography and environments feeling both beautiful and raw. 1917 begs for the biggest screen around, and while at it, a powerful sound system to complete the experience with. Thomas Newman's score enhances the emotions and makes for an impactful viewing experience, further amplified by the great acting showcased from start to finish.Second, this is a big movie. It has stakes; it is intense, and it is psychologically raw enough to really hit at certain moments. It does feature violence and gore, but more so of corpses rather than other gore-heavy movies like Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge. Together with the plot - which does have a surprising depth and multiple interpretations - it might not be possible to take everything in at once. Certain plot elements along the way certainly has the power to make a second viewing just as powerful, if not even more.1917 does have some sore spots, though. At some points in the movie are a few details which can break the immersion in terms of logic and consistency. This would not be a big issue at all if not for the immersive qualities which makes it feel slightly more 'off' than it would otherwise do, however, the movie does hint that the story at certain moments might not be told as objectively as first thought. If those moments are viewed more subjectively from the protagonists' point of view, those issues can fade away as those details are not likely to be expressively or accurately perceived in the heat of the moment.Another important factor is the sheer force of the movie, which might also feel uncomfortable at moments, but then again, it is a big movie. Almost too authentic, it creeps under your skin, it grows on you, and it stays with you emotionally long after it has ended.And rightfully so.My personal grade: a forceful 9/10.

Big Fish," Before Watching: Big Fish (2003)
","'Big Fish' (2003) is a charming movie about a dying father and his confused son. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is directed by Tim Burton. If you are familiar with Burton's other movies, that explains it all.If you are not familiar with Burton, however, his characteristics are a plethora of witty, weird and wacky moments. Things do not always make perfect sense, but they do not have to. The sweet, charming feeling that surrounds all those small moments is more that enough to compensate for any potential, nick-picky irregularities - if they are even there.Big Fish is certainly a Burton-movie, and a great one. Expect all of the above, along with some surprisingly profound moments and dialogue that might change the way you think about things. As far as warnings goes, there are a few butts shown throughout the runtime, but nothing more than that. The ending could come off as emotionally intense, but in all, Big Fish is a pleasant ride.My personal grade: a gleeful 8/10.

The Dark Knight," Before Watching: The Dark Knight (2008)
","'The Dark Knight' (2008) is the second movie of Nolan's Batman Trilogy and objectively one of the highest praised movies of all time. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:The Dark Knight is ultimately an ideological fight between Batman and the Joker. To understand Batman's side of things, it is very helpful to watch Batman Begins first. It introduces you to Bruce Wayne, his morality and sets up his relationship with Rachel as well as with the city of Gotham as well. It also sets the tone for the type of superhero Batman is, namely a mere human who doesn't have futuristic (yet sweet) technology or magical powers. It is almost a pre-requisite watch, and you will not regret investing in its additional runtime.Then it's the Joker. Never before has a character been so mentally unstable and still made so much sense. He is extreme, intense, but worst of all - understandable and far too relatable. The clash between the Joker and Batman creates a chaotic, brutal and disturbing nail-biter that viewers need to embrace for. The violence is not very gory or graphic, yet the psychological implications are enormous.Then there is the rest of the movie. The other characters fill out the movie impeccably and completes the on-going characters dynamics as well as plot events. It never feels forced, just one smooth stream that keeps you entertained to the limit. In addition: the score is a revelation, the cinematography and camera work are beautiful and lush, and the small, fantastic details littered throughout will keep your mind occupied and crave additional viewings. It is gritty, absolutely fantastic and superbly well made. The Dark Knight does indeed shine as one of the brightest pearls in cinema history.My personal grade: a disturbingly brilliant 10/10.

Taken," Before Watching: Taken (2008)
","'Taken' (2008) is an intense action movie starring Liam Neeson, and the first installment in the Taken franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Taken's plot revolves around trafficking and, unsurprisingly, abduction. Other sensitive topics are also brought up, such as prostitution. All in all, it creates a very dark and sometimes disturbing tone, which some viewers can find repulsive. Nevertheless, Taken never exploits said subjects deeper than what's necessary. Although intense, it is manageable.Taken is also a very violent film. The fight scenes, thanks to the contrasts from the relatively soft beginning and family interactions, can have a very shocking and brutal approach. Blood is present, but never in excess.There are two sequels to this movie, which continues the established premises but doesn't contribute much more than additional runtime. One could skip them and not miss out on much, however, if you find yourself a die-hard fan of Taken, it could be of interest to at least watch the second installment and take it from there.My personal grade: a rock solid 8/10.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Before Watching: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)
","'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' (2009) is the second Transformers movie depicting the infamous robot clash. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen follows suit from its prequel by showcasing great effects and scenery, and also by lacking sound logic and interesting characters. However, this movie takes one step down in the latter category as the first half of the movie is filled with downright absurd situations and a lot of sexual innuendos which feels extremely pushed and wholly unrealistic. It is not until the second half of the runtime that Transformers 2 elevates itself to a similar level of that of the first movie.The characters can also be perceived as being more extreme, in the sense that there is rarely any moment where characters develop but stay with their 'for or against'-conviction. Their interactions are also noticeably louder, which could be fatiguing for some after two and a half hours.Conclusively, if one liked the first Transformers, the same won't be too bothered. Nevertheless, if another person spends his or her time watching objectively better movies, that person will be, at which point Transformers 2 stops being entertaining whatsoever.My personal grade: an annoying 4/10.

Joker," Before Watching: Joker (2019)
","'Joker' (2019) is a story about a man pushed to his limits from the society around him. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Before the review of Joker's contents, a few words need to be said about the controversy and debate Joker stirred prior to its release (and which still persists). Amongst other things, one caution has been that Joker tries to have the audience sympathize with a psychopath who commits violent crimes. The answers to presumptions in that category are very complex. Joker deals with tough topics such as mental illness, poverty, bullying and social class division to an extent where you are likely to feel impacted in some way. However, that doesn't mean that you justify the actions the main character, Arthur - and that is the point a lot of people fails to see. Sympathizing does not equal justifying, and while you can feel pity for the troubles Arthur goes through, you never condone the actions that he takes. Joker is not about that. Joker is about witnessing a man getting crushed under the vices of the people and system around him, and about understanding the role we as citizens and bystanders have in creating Jokers like him.That being said, this movie is psychologically dark and disturbing. Not purely from the grim and the Kafkaesque tone, but mainly from how real this movie is. Joker sucks you in to a sequence of events that could already be going on in some part of the world - and quite likely is. Nothing feels over-the-top or pushed, whether it be the characters, sexual elements, or even the violence. It all blends together perfectly together with the constantly menacing atmosphere. That is not to say that these elements don't exist or gets noticed - there are for example a few extremely graphic and violent scenes that are very impactful and piercing, but mainly because of their rarity and the underlying pressure behind them.Technically, this movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography is consistently gorgeous with amazing colors and just the right lighting, and the score is simplistic, hypnotizing and shockingly brutal. The pacing is perfection defined, and the dialogue will be quoted for years to come. Last but not least, Joaquin Phoenix delivers a feat which evolves Arthur into something more than an actor's performance.That leads us to the final question - does Phoenix's performance live up to that of Ledger's? While the different Jokers explores different sides of the Joker persona, there is little to no doubt that Phoenix has lived up to the sky-high level Ledger set. On a personal note: while I still revel in the chaotic dynamics of the Dark Knight, I ultimately find myself more intrigued and horrified with Arthur Fleck, and his gradual descent into madness, step by step.My personal grade: a haunting 9/10.

Sherlock Holmes," Before Watching: Sherlock Holmes (2009)
","'Sherlock Holmes' (2009) is an intellectual mystery movie featuring a great deal of character through Downey Jr. and Law. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:The character known as Sherlock Holmes is perceived in pop culture as a charismatic investigator who with his almost-supernatural set of abilities can crack even the toughest murder mysteries. This movie follows suites and is filled to the brim with wit, charismatic glee, and the essential, almost stereotypical antagonists (which borderlines the Satanistic realms, so sensitive watchers to that are cautioned). Nevertheless, the dynamic relationship which Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law showcases glues the movie together and fill in the cracks excellently - save one point.The thrill of the movie, as well as the plot itself, hinges on the clues and details scattered throughout the runtime. They are obvious to recognize, but practically impossible to understand and put into context, save to Holmes. Where Sherlock Holmes could have its audience analyzing and pondering about the implication about the revealed objects, it instead saves the relevance until one big presentation after the climax, at which point the objects have lost a great deal of interest. This lack and use of information can lead some audiences to feeling alienated, uninterested and possibly frustrated, which is something to be cautioned about beforehand. As average entertainment, however, Sherlock Holmes does just fine.The music from Hans Zimmer deserves a mention for its creative use of contemporary instruments blended in a dissonance still harmonious. A unique piece for sure, and one of a few great things that still makes Sherlock Holmes a pleasant watching experience, which is even enhanced in the sequel.My personal grade: a frustrating but fun 6/10.

","'Wall-E' (2008) is an innovative animation movie for the whole family. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Wall-E is - obviously - first and foremost a children's movie. A few plot elements will not make sense if you think about them too much. Be ready for this if you are one of those who like to systematically analyze decision and options, instead, just enjoy the charm this movie has to offer.That leads into the second important thing about this movie - it is surprisingly sweet and charming. There is a lot of emotions on screen, but they are carried by the main protagonists through expressions and body language rather than language - and it works extremely well. Do not be ashamed if you get touched, it is but another sign of this phenomenal way of storytelling.A word also needs to be said for the great music and amazing visuals this movie has to offer. The earth environment is close to being photorealistic, and the colors are rich and vibrant throughout the runtime. Find a big screen with some great speakers and an adequate subwoofer, and you are in for a treat.And stay for the clever end credits.My personal grade: a charming 8/10.

The Terminal," Before Watching: The Terminal (2004)
","'The Terminal' (2004) is a well-rounded and entertaining movie about getting stranded on an airport (and a few things more). If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:The Terminal is as said above about a man who, thanks to peculiar circumstances, finds himself stuck in the JFK airport. Even though the premise doesn't wear an aura of joy and happiness, this movie still manages to create one, much thanks to Tom Hanks great acting and the ingenuity and character of his role. Some supporting side characters also contribute greatly to this, to in the end produce an original and captivating piece of lighthearted (and sometimes poignant) fun.The only major flaw that can be perceived lies within the antagonist, the stern and cold-hearted airport supervisor. A lot of decisions taken feels extremely unwarranted, and even though they are to some degree necessary to push the narrative forward, can ultimately feel very uncalled for or scripted. This doesn't detract enormously, but it still something that could be relevant for few. All in all, The Terminal is well-paced, entertaining and most definitely a charmingly watch.My personal grade: a simply great 7/10.

","'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994) is both an excellent drama and the highest rated movie on IMDb, and for a good reason. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is a prison movie. There are harsh language, a lot of profanity, violence (although not too graphic), and some psychologically intense moments. The opening scene features some very sensual elements, and the subject of rape is heavily present in the first half of the movie as well. Overall, it is easy to see why this is a R-rated movie.Nevertheless, all of that can be derived from the Parents Guide. What the Parents Guide doesn't necessarily tell you is how impactful this movie is. It requires an additional half an hour after the credits have rolled to really be appreciated and soaked in, and make sure to take that into consideration. One should never put him- or herself in a stressful situation before, during or after watching this.The Shawshank Redemption is brilliant, and treat it as such.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:One of the biggest issues with Taken 2 is not its content, but how it has been portrayed and treated in mainstream and social media. At face value, Taken 2 is an okay action movie - not great, but not particularly bad either. The movie does have a few problems and inconsistencies as action sequels often does, but they are not as prevalent and 'in your face' as one might think.Content-wise, this movie is packed with violence and fighting like the first Taken. However, it is less impactful and personal compared to the first installment, and thereby doesn't carry the same emotional weight. It is not nearly as dark as its predecessor as well, as Taken 2 revolves mostly around revenge and not international women trafficking. The editing is very choppy at times, but not as bad or nauseous as social media sometimes portrays it to be. Throw stereotypical judgement aside, and this movie will instantly become more enjoyable.My personal grade: a decent 7/10.

","'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012) is the third and final movie of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:The Dark Knight Rises is a semi-independent continuation of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and as such, you will benefit greatly from having watched the prequels. Not because the storyline picks up directly after The Dark Knight, but because the previous movies add a lot of character to Bruce Wayne. Then, obviously, there are references to the earlier movies as well which are more and less important.Other than watching the prequels, there isn't too much too preparation necessary to enjoy this movie. Bane is not a disturbing as the Joker but is still an excellent antagonist in his own way (in other words, don't expect the same tone of intensiveness). A few moments will also require some suspension of disbelief as far as physical endurance goes, but other than that, The Dark Knight Rises is a worthy addition and finisher of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. A great screen and sound system will - as with the earlier two movies - reward you generously from start to finish.My personal grade: a satisfactory 8/10.

Ben-Hur," Before Watching: Ben-Hur (1959)
","'Ben-Hur' (1959) is a classic and undeniable epic from the golden years of Hollywood. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Ben-Hur checks in at about three and a half hours. It is long. There is a lot of set-up and a lot of dialogue. However, more than just being simply excessive, Ben-Hur rarely feels unnecessary or tedious. Both scenes and people have a point, and they are enough nuanced and interesting for the movie to captivate and spellbind throughout the entire runtime. Make time for it, and give the movie the whole of the afternoon or evening that it needs. There is an intermission halfway through to take a breath.The production value of Ben-Hur is matched by few other movies and is on level with the Lord of the Rings and Titanic. It is massive, epic, and it feels real (the few effects present are of a surprisingly high quality as well!). The stunts are stunning and the stages jaw-dropping, and locations are consistently on point. The sound is great as well. The more you can spoil these attributes with a great sound and screen, the more you will be favored in return.The movie, nevertheless, features a strong, Christian vibe which certifies Jesus as the Savior and Son of God. Depending on one's attitude to religious elements, this can be either a great addition or a subtracting nuisance, especially since this element features a lot of the movie's resolution.So, in all, Ben-Hur is a brilliant, awe-inspiring epic which however feature strong Christian elements in its extensive runtime. It is a lot, but if you can take a lot in, this is a thrill sure to leave an impression.My personal grade: a magnificent 10/10.

Before Sunrise," Before Watching: Before Sunrise (1995)
","'Before Sunrise' (1995) is a fine, charming romance between two young adults, Jesse and Celine. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie's impact will most likely depend on you. Before Sunrise is essentially a dialogue between the two characters in their early 20's who discuss things 20-year olds do think about. There is talk about longing, life and love, and there is existential question as well which belongs to the corresponding generation still seeking for answers. If you are roughly in the same position and age as these characters, some reasonings and train of thoughts will feel hauntingly familiar, and you will be spellbound throughout the runtime. If you, however, are not in the same life situation, their interactions might come off as uninteresting and somewhat naive. In that sense, it is very difficult to generally estimate this movie's emotional impact, as it spans such a wide spectrum depending on the viewer(s) individual situation.Content-wise, this movie is surprisingly profound yet sometime a bit crude in its dialogue. Towards the last third, the tone becomes very serious and partly sexual, which can throw off certain viewers. Nothing too explicit is shown nor said, yet the theme is very prevalent and implied for that specific part of the movie.Perhaps the most important part comes into play afterwards. There are currently two sequels out there, but do NOT rush into those movies merely for the sake of watching them. Instead, Before Sunrise asks for you to let itself sink in. The last 10-15 minutes in combination with some of the dialogue in mind can be quite emotional, haunting - and rewarding. Having only watched the second installment in the 'Before'-series, it is my opinion that Before Sunrise is by far the superior, and rushing too fast into the other movies will deprive you of the unique feeling this movie leaves. Let one or two nights pass before, and savor them.My personal grade: an impactful 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",8,0,0,14 July 2019
The Deer Hunter," Before Watching: The Deer Hunter (1978)
","'The Deer Hunter' (1978) is a gripping presentation of the impact of war on ordinary people. It is tough, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:One of the most important things to know about this movie beforehand is that despite it being a war movie, Deer Hunter isn't really a war movie. It does feature the Vietnam War, but there are no grand skirmishes or heroic sacrifices like other war movies often tend to include. Instead, Deer Hunter treats the Vietnam War as a rough and even life-changing bump in the road for the main characters, who tries to cope with it the best they can. The war comes, and it goes. Most of the movie is made up of before-and-after, so do not expect longer elements of guerilla warfare. Expect instead to see life, as ordinary and mundane as it might be, and the devastating impact of the war on the minds of those who experience it.With that clarification understood and accepted, it is critical to understand that this movie is still violent, disturbing and intense far beyond ordinary movies of today. Thanks to the built-up connection to the characters, the movie makes you sit at the edge of your seat for a good two hours straight. The occasional violence spikes through whatever defense constructed, all the more impactful thanks to its non-glorified yet brutal way. The mood is intense, even afterwards when it shouldn't be. You cling on to small events and minor dialogue like if it's were the very rope of your own life, and when it hits, it hits hard. This movie requires quite a psyche and mental endurance indeed.There are minor things that should be addressed too that can add understanding and caution. Some of the details around the wedding stems from Russian tradition with added wedding rituals and manners. There is frequent profanity throughout the runtime, and one of the male characters is completely nude at a point. The film is also littered with symbolism, which certainly can be more greatly enjoyed at a second viewing for those who can mentally endure it twice.All in all, the Deer Hunter is a hard-hitting, gripping drama that is sure to leave you a bit differently from what you were. Embrace yourself, and allow it to sink it.My personal grade: a shocking 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",9,2,4,6 September 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," Before Watching: Saving Mr. Banks (2013)
","'Saving Mr. Banks' (2013) is a charming movie about the people and relations behind the famous Mary Poppins. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:It's easy to dismiss Saving Mr. Banks at first glance as rather slow-paced and uninteresting for anyone that wasn't caught by the initial Mary Poppins-wave. That judgement could to an extent be justified, since this is after all a typical drama feature, and as such, rarely bothers itself with intense action sequences or an over-emphasized conflict of epic proportions. However, that does not mean that Saving Mr. Banks is not intriguing nor captivating - its intensity is just experienced in a different, but still present way. The aim lies on the aim protagonist, Pamela Travers, and her background as well as psychological connection to her work of fiction. Although she might come off as cold and one-dimensional, she grows into a very satisfying and cathartic arch towards the end.The side characters do a great job with providing the additional and much needed warmth, which elevates the movie in a curious and quite cheerful way. The opposites of personalities make for amusing as well as deep felt interactions, all interwoven with relevant flashbacks for Mrs. Travers. The music is almost too catchy, the scenery lush, and all things considered makes for a cozy and relaxing experience - save the ending which can come off as a bit abrupt and sudden, but still relevant and understandable.My personal grade: a pleasant 7/10.

","'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' (1975) is a genius piece of British comedy. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is absolute nuts. First some cautions, though - there is some gore and blood (although so over-the-top is comedic), a few scenes which might be classified as religiously offensive, and a longer scene which is highly sexually suggestive. All these things can be uncomfortable for people that are sensitive to the respective categories and should in that case be taken into account.As for the rest of the movie, it is insane. Humor is usually created when there is a plot-twist that deviates from one's expectations, and in that sense, this movie is nothing but humor. Its sole purpose is to make sure the viewer never stands steady and comfortable in what to expect, and that this the only expectation one can have. If quirky yet brilliant and genius humor like this is appreciated, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an absolute feast, and make sure to watch the Special Editions that features the short 'Dentist On the Job.'My personal grade: a hilarious 8/10.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:In this movie, The Transformers saga continues more or less in the same tone as the previous two instalments. The effects and scenery continue to be well done and at moments exciting, but beyond the extravaganza and explosions, little to none substance remains. These movies aren't in that sense made for depth or thoughtful philosophies, which remains the main point to be aware of.Secondly, the characters can feel very one-dimensional. The main protagonist Sam spends most of his scream time running, with his new girlfriend (which poses a major plot inconsistency) running behind screaming. Rarely does it feel like the characters are human, which robs the dramatic as well as the more tender moments of impact.In terms of consistency, this movie is, nevertheless, the soundest. It's a clear improvement from Transformers 2, but not enough to really be satisfying except to its target audience.My personal grade: a bland 5/10.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie can be perceived as both inspiring and very, very stressful depending on the viewer. It shows the protagonist, Christopher Gardner, dealing with a lot of struggles who rarely leaves him a moment to breathe, and his attempts to push through again and again. It is hardship after hardship after hardship for almost 2 hours, which are rewarding from time to time, but as said, it can ultimately be perceived in very contrasting ways.The dynamic between Christopher (Will Smith) and his son (Jaden Smith) is heartwarming and touching, which adds another layer to either of the previously mentioned sides the viewer finds him or herself on. Otherwise, The Pursuit of Happyness doesn't attempt to wow the viewer with stunning scenery or a bombastic soundtrack. It is a down-to-earth drama about a father and a son, stripped of any distracting elements to provide a very human experience.My personal grade: an inspiring 8/10.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is one of the stronger - if not the strongest - feature in the Indiana Jones-movies. It is thrilling, inventive, and very dynamic, which when coupled with beautiful scenery and very few instances of obvious CGI produce an adventure to remember. It loves a bigger screen to capture the scope of both Mediterranean and Middle East vistas, and if you have found yourself a fan of the first two movies, you will in no way be disappointed.There are a few things which probably should receive a heads up, however. There are some sexual innuendos that occur briefly, and as the other Indiana Jones-movies, it is quite graphic and violent. Not as much as the first two, but still more than what you would think for an action adventure. Regarding the characters, there are times where the relationship between Indiana and Henry can feel a bit cliché and slightly too humorous, but it doesn't distract from the story nor events.All in all, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a pretty straight-forward adventure thrill, that when accepted with its minor warnings keeps the tempo and hardly if ever let's go.Also, they have a freaking zeppelin.

If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Generally speaking, The Bourne Supremacy is more intense, more violent and more intellectually demanding than its prequel, but also less charming. A few events in the beginning rob the movie of a part of its soul, which it later tries to compensate for with more spectacular scenes then what we were treated with in The Bourne Identity. The more you prefer action over character dynamics, the less of an issue this creates. However, the opposite is also true.As said above, this movie is more demanding than the first installment. Attention needs to be put into understanding events and reasoning, otherwise the movie might come across as all too random and complicated.Finally, The Bourne Supremacy begins the trend of which the Bourne-franchise is infamous for: the shaky cam. Although it can be a bit distracting sometimes, Greengrass handles it well and it is not too confusing nor disorientating. Do not let it put you off beforehand.

A lot of the humor is however irreverent, so if crude jokes bothers you, there will be a few cringey moments.The Simpsons Movie is also serious at times. Despite being a comedy, it delivers some impactful moments that transcends its normal, witty approach.
