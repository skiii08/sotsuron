The Blair Witch Project," I liked it, and for good reason.
","I've heard some really negative things about this movie, mostly from idiots who don't have a clue about films unless every detail is spelled out to them.(Hey, Look! SPOILERS ahead! I put my own tag, IMDb, please don't add yours as well!)I've heard people say the acting is bad, that it's just people screaming & shaking the camera.  THAT'S THE POINT!  If that was happening to YOU, you'd scream a lot and shake whatever you were holding, too!  Also, some people have said the cast didn't know what they were doing. Well, they weren't SUPPOSED to know! Kids lost in the woods rarely know what they're doing! Besides, half the movie was ad-libbed! Intentionally!I've also heard complaints about the marketing scheme & the website & the hype, but I never knew about ANY of that stuff before I saw the film. And I've heard complaints about people thinking it's real.  Well, DUH! Of course it's not real! It's a movie! how else do you think the cast was able to do interviews & such after shooting it!?Okay, now that I've vented, on with the review.Great movie, one of the few horror films I've ever actually liked.  The acting/improvisation was excellent. Heather pulled off her part to a T, Josh kicked extreme amounts of butt, and Mike was okay.Great imagery and cinematography.  The B&W/Color contrast between the two cameras really added some extra depth by letting you see what parts their teacher would actually see if it'd ever been turned in. And the shaped branches, the bloody shirt, the stone piles, the screeching, Mike standing in the corner,...it all just added so much to the movie. Pay close attention to the interviews & narration at the beginning, otherwise much of the imagery won't make sense.All in all, great film. Buy it. Don't rent it, 'cause when you rent, you have to bring it back. Buy it.",Null,0,1,19 December 2002
Spider-Man," Begone, fools!
","I loved this movie! I desparately need to get it on video!Tobey Maguire is without a doubt one of the best actors to come out of the last decade. He does an extraordinary job with a role many were surprised he'd get, considering his usual parts are more subdued.Kirsten Dunst. Stunning as always, talented as always, hot as always, she takes a role that otherwise would have been boring & pointless as bleep (albeit crucial to the plot), and put some life into Mary Jane!Willem Dafoe, I've heard, is a great actor. I've actually never seen any of his other work, but after this, I understand what they mean.  He brilliantly handles the slow psychosis and schitzophrenic behavior required of the Goblin.The supporting cast is all great as well. So is the CGI. The ony times when you can REALLY tell it's fake are (minor spoilers) when the guys discentigrate and when he jumps across rooftops out of costume.Unlike a lot of Spidey fans, I really don't mind the natural webbing or different origin of the fateful spider.  In fact, the way Raimi did it actually works better on screen than the comic version would have.The sequels are gonna rock just as much as this movie did.  My predictions for main villains: Hobgoblin (Harry, without a doubt) and Venom. Am I right? We shall see...",Null,0,0,8 November 2002
The Princess Bride," So good, and yet, so good!
","I don't get how some people don't understand the comedy of this movie. It's very much a fairy-tale spoof, sort of a more subtle version of Shrek. That's where much of the comedy comes from, as well as from some of the sheer silliness that provides a stark contrast to the setting and tone. I love sheer silliness, when used properly, and this movie does exactly that.The Princess Bride is my 3rd favorite movie ever (#1 is Head, #2 is UHF), and for good reason. It is wonderfully written (by the same guy who wrote the book, thankfully), superbly directed (by the same guy who directed North, ironically), and perfectly acted (by the same people who, um, played other famous roles).Cary Elwes (Robin Hood: Men In Tights) keeps Westly exactly where he should be, as a caring, yet caustic, hero. Robin Wright Penn (Forrest Gump) handles Buttercup wonderfully as the 'straight man' to all the off-the-wall loons she's surrounded by. Andre the Giant (WWF) shows that not all wrestlers make bad actors. Chew on that, Rock! Mandy Patinkin gives us one of the greatest film characters of all time: Inigo Montoya. NO ONE could've played that role better! Wallace Shawn (good actor in lots of bad movies) thankfully gets a good part for once as the Sicilian genius Vezzini. (Yes, Sicilians are geniuses.) Chris Sarandon (probably related to Susan) delivers Prince Humperdinck in such a way that almost seems dull at first, then you realize he's intentionally making the Prince look like cardboard, and does a great job of it. Christopher Guest makes an enjoyably hateable Count Rugen. I have great respect for actors who can make villans both delightful and despicable. Peter Falk (Columbo) serves us well as the Grandfather reading the story, and Fred Savage (Wonder Years, the Wizard) actually entertains for once, rather than annoys, as the sick Grandson.Then there are the small parts, which manage to steal scenes from this already genius cast. Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his wife Valerie brighten the screen from beneath all that age makeup. Peter Cook is the Impressive Clergyman with the hilarious speech impediment. ('Mawaige is wat bwings us togever today.') And there's so much more.So go ahead then, bow if you will, bow to the critics of slime, 'Bride'-haters of muck! Boooooo! Because this movie is a gem. It should be cherished, not chastised. I don't mind if you don't like it, but don't tell me it's a bad film. 'Cause if The Princess Bride is a bad film, then why don't you tell me what a good film is?No? Okay, then, 'As you wish.'",9,0,1,1 November 2002
