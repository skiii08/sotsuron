Blade Runner 2049," my bladerunner 2049 questions...
","I can believe that Tyrell DELIBERATELY made the replicants sterile, but it's not credible that Wallace, with the technological power at his disposal, is unable to create reproducing replicants.Secondly, why does Wallace want reproducing replicants? Surely this is going to make them more independent and difficult to control? He claims that it is too slow to create replicants. But the replicants he creates are FULLY GROWN. It takes 18 years for a child to be raised and grown the normal way. Surely it is in fact MUCH SLOWER to create replicants by sexual reproduction.Further, if it is so difficult to create replicants, why does Wallace kill two brand new perfectly good replicants during the movie?Why does Luv need to kill Joshi in order to find out K's whereabouts? K snaps a tiny antenna which incredibly seems to be enough to make him invisible to Luv. But his whereabouts are apparently still being tracked by Joshi's database. How come Luv/Wallace can't access the same database? What are Joshi's motives in apparently hiding K?Is Steline telling the truth about her childhood? How did she get from the orphanage to the virtual reality chamber where she says she has been since the age of 8? Did some incredibly rich parents adopt her and buy her a bubble and presumably nurses and nannies to raise her?Why would Wallace send Deckard off world? Why can't he make him talk / torture him / analyse him on earth? Where Wallace is? What advantage is there in sending him off world?How could K know where Luv and Deckard are in order to shoot them down? As a bladerunner does he have access to some database that tracks every other replicant in the city? If so why would Luv be so stupid as to leave him alive? How come it is harder for Luv to find K than it is for K to find Luv? (She had to kill Joshi in order to access the database)? Are Wallace/Luv directly in control of the police force (bladerunners)? (It seems not, otherwise they wouldn't have to kill Joshi). But if they're not in control of the police why would they follow and protect K with aerial drones? Wouldn't this be of concern to K and Joshi? K doesn't seem particularly bothered by the drone attack.Why does K take Deckard to see Steline (his daughter)? Isn't he afraid that he will lead Wallace directly to the child? How can he be certain that Wallace won't access the same database that Joshi has? Obviously Steline can't leave her bubble, so once Wallace knows he was there then she's got big problems.Ok those were my main questions.I LOVE the soundtrack. And the art direction is amazing! But the plot is not very well fleshed out.",9,0,4,15 January 2018
This Is the End," Brilliant
","I felt that I had to add my ten cents here because there are so many reviewers who gave this one star. Really? I can imagine certain people finding this offensive. But I can't imagine anyone not laughing in this film. If you don't laugh there must be something wrong with you. Maybe you've never done drugs, or never masturbated. If you've seen these actors in other projects you can kind of guess what you're in for here. This is both MORE CRASS and MORE IMAGINATIVE than their other films. In some ways it really does push some boundaries so I guess it might have offended a few people. I'm sure the cast would have been disappointed if it didn't.The only reason I didn't give this 10 out of 10 is because I thought the musical choices were boring and a bit stereotyped. Backstreet boys? Gangnam style? Paper planes? These songs didn't seem left field enough to fit with the rest of the movie, and I couldn't imagine the characters really listening to this stuff in real life. DMX and the Ruffrider crew got a name check at one point so it seemed logical that they should be getting down to something like that.",9,0,3,28 October 2013
Ender's Game," rubbish!!!
","I feel I must help bring the rating of this movie down to an appropriate level. This is some serious rubbish. The narrative stinks big time and the premise is utterly ridiculous.The story goes something like this: Earth was attacked by a bunch of alien spaceships. Earth destroyed the alien fleet. Fifty years has passed. No sign of the aliens since that time, in fact they seem to be living peacefully in their own solar system. No attempts have been made to communicate with them. Nonetheless the humans consider themselves at war. They build an enormous space fleet and for some unexplained reason they need children to pilot the ships. The kids are trained in a luxurious space station which astonishingly seems to have only three adults on board. The kids train by playing elaborate strategy games (this part feels very much like the Harry Potter movies).Even though there's no evidence to suggest the aliens are about to attack, the humans decide they must immediately and desperately assault the alien planet. Somehow we now have the technology to go pretty much instantly to foreign solar systems. The earth fleet attacks the alien planet in a battle that is incredibly brief and a huge anti-climax. The humans destroy the entire planet using some unbelievable super weapon (seems like the humans are the bad guys in this film). When the protagonist realises what he has been a part of he walks outside of the command headquarters (which is situated on some vague planet whose location is never really made clear). Incredibly only a few metres away from the human base is an alien, who has been hanging out in a ruined ship for fifty years without being noticed. The alien gives the protagonist an egg with the potential to rebirth the alien race. Despite being essentially a manipulated pawn, the protagonist is rewarded spectacularly for his role in the so-called war. He is given his own spaceship to search the galaxy for a suitable planet to hatch the egg.Harrison Ford must have lost his mind to get mixed up in such a truly ridiculous storyline.The only win here is the special effects.",1,1,3,15 February 2014
Climax," BORING!!! (tomato thrown at screen)
","Ok, if you were expecting something like Irreversible or Enter the Void then you will be very very disappointed.I don't think Noe is trying hard enough here. This feels like a student film made in a weekend. It may well have been made in only a few hours. It's quick and crude.It appears that an actual dance troupe was hired and encouraged to 'act'. There appears to have been no script whatsoever.The best parts of the movie are some very long dance routines. They take up almost half the movie, it's quite impressive but during the second one I found myself reaching for the fast forward button.The second half of the film is incredibly boring. The contrast with the beginning is clunky. It's an entire group of twenty people acting randomly and violently, without any story. It goes on and on... there's a rough concept about a sangria spiked with LSD but that's about as much story as we get. Why did the dancers become so violent and horrible? Not explained. There's some cheap camera stunts and then the film ends.It's super embarrassing that Noe turned this out.Also note, I am a huge fan of electronic music, and the soundtrack really wasn't all that hot in my opinion. The long tracks played in the dance scenes are super repetitive and become tedious. The film seems to be attempting to be set in the 1990s but the music is evidently not from that time period, which contributes to the cheap quick and nasty vibe of this production.",2,1,5,26 May 2019
Django Unchained," don't believe the hype
","This is far from being as great as a lot of folks are saying. It's not a total piece of rubbish, but this is definitely not Tarantino at his best.Firstly let me just say, that the action isn't terribly well done. A couple of years back Tarantino thought hey, lets create shootout scenes that involve everyone dying in about the space of ten seconds. The first time he did this it was great. Now it feels like a joke we've seen too many times. Can't we have a prolonged action scene where the tension builds up and up?Secondly there are a lot of what are apparently minor flaws: Why does the woman (as Django shoots her at the end of the movie) fly off to the side as if pulled by a rope? Is it meant to look fake? If so why? I don't get it. Why introduce the mysterious character of the woman with the red bandanna across her face, only to have her disposed of in the space of ten seconds? Why does Shultz shoot Candie at a time when he knows it risks the girl's life? Seems out of character to me, since he has risked everything to save the girl. Also the Shultz character seems to be too closely akin to the character the same actor played in Inglorious Basterds (which I felt was a much better movie). Couldn't they come up with something more varied? And the Australians working for the mining company are utterly implausible. Did they somehow get teleported directly from outback Australia to Southern USA without losing one iota of their slang and dialect? I don't buy it.Anyway I could go on picking holes in this movie. But I'll leave it there.",1,5,10,29 January 2013
Limitless," the plot holes are bigger than the plot!
","I actually thought this was a fun drug movie in a lot of ways. The zooming camera work was amazing and the acting was pretty good too. However it must be noted that the plot is utterly incomprehensible!!! I don't think the director or screenwriter or anyone else could explain it if they tried. I'm wondering whether the plot was made like this on purpose in order to make it feel trippy. So to make the audience feel that they themselves are going crazy on drugs!OK, so here's just a few of the enormous gaping holes: 1. Cops grab a suspicious guy at a murder scene and don't pat him down or search him. wtf?! 2. Protagonist borrows $100 000 despite the fact he can make this much in two days. He then forgets to pay the loan back despite being super smart. wtf?!. 3. Girl gets inexplicably murdered while protagonist inexplicably blanks out. Does this play any role in the story? Nope. Do we find out why? Nope. Or who? Nope. 4. Where did the smart pills come from? How come there isn't a bunch of super smart guys connected to the original lab?I could go on and on but the holes are so big it's hard to define them! It feels like the individual scenes were inserted they way they are because somebody thought they were good individual scenes. The scenes feature the same characters but they feel like they are from slightly different movies!The other thing that needs a mention is the seriously backwards moral message in this film. The guy gets super smart and what does he do? He amasses money and drugs and runs for president. He pays lawyers to cover up his involvement in various murders. When you think about it the movie telling us that 'being smart means being a scumbag'.",5,1,2,14 September 2013
Warcraft," depressing story
","This is really awful. I watched this on the basis of a high IMDb score so I feel obliged to weigh in and help push the score down.I had trouble caring about the characters and I daydreamed off several times. The action is often very sudden so zoning out made it hard to follow the story.I did however watch the ending and it is very depressing. Massive spoiler alert!!!!! The king has the human-looking orc kill him, apparently so that she can be taken back in by the orc-horde. Why not try and escape? Surely these guys need their king more than the off-chance that the orcs are dumb enough to believe this orc girl is on their side. Amazingly they take her back in. But then she intervenes to save the life of the other human, warning the orc demon that he will lose his leadership if he kills this human (in the specific context they are in). So it's OK to kill the king but not the warrior? Isn't she trying to get the orc demon disowned by the horde? This is blatant and contrived set up for the next movie. And frankly it's very downbeat and depressing. Hard to come away from this thinking: 'great' can't wait for the next movie.",1,24,48,7 September 2016
