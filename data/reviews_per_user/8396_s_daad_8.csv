Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too good to belong to Star Wars
","The assessment of the Star Wars films seem to be all upside down. To my mind, The Empire Strikes Back from the original trilogy is by far the worst of the six, but it is universally judged to be the best. On the other hand, The Phantom Menace is universally derided, and yet I find it to be the best. It is beautifully scripted; the pace is handled to perfection. The acting all round is superb. The special effects are dazzling, and only gratuitous in the sense that there are too many ugly aliens walking around the periphery. Since this is a problem with all the Star Wars films, TPM should be commended for being restrained, in fact. At least it minimises the ugliness factor by giving the alien characters depth and verisimilitude (utilizing CGI to its limits). Otherwise the effects serve the story very well. Other than the original film, this is the only instalment that never becomes boring and is always engaging.But why does everybody hate it? It was perplexing at first, but then I had another look at the originals and it suddenly dawned on me. One thing we tend to forget is that the original Star Wars films were very ordinary. The hype and the history tend to cloud judgement in this regard. Stars Wars became a phenomenon because it symbolised something vital and crucial for its age. The concept of the Force embodied the morality/religion of the space age. The ground-breaking special effects imbued optimism in the troubled seventies. A fairy tale was told, and people were caught up in the story. They didn't mind that the acting, writing, direction etc was poor. We pretended that the films were good, and we maintained that pretense for a long time. Then came the Phantom Menace, and this really was a menace. It threatened our hallowed pretences. Here was a top quality film calling itself 'Star Wars', and next to it the original trilogy looked extremely shoddy. The fans couldn't take the exposure, and thus the knee jerk reaction against the new instalment. That's my theory.It is not just a question of improved special effects. Of course there is that. The effects are so advanced in TPM that those in the original film look distinctly prehistoric in comparison. The advance in science is matched by the cinematography, so that we are treated with a vision that is exponentially more grand in every way. But the fans can always persuade us to ignore technical excellence and focus on artistic excellence. That's what the critics of TPM appear to be doing, only that in the process they get stuck on an intransigent bias. The complaint is that the new film is badly acted, poorly directed, overburdened with special effects, boring, inconsistent, peopled with obnoxious and unappealing characters, and so on. It's one big bias, that's all. The fans feel threatened by the new product, and there is a spontaneous rejection. Whatever they are saying about TPM, I will say that the exact opposite is true. It is not only a triumph of filmmaking; it is also the triumphant realisation of a long cherished vision of George Lucas. The man himself has proclaimed that he does not like the original trilogy, not after he has perfected his vision in the later instalments. His legion of fans begs to differ, preferring the inept filmmaking of the young George Lucas, and the wooden interactions of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer and Harrison Ford.Of the host of criticisms leveled by the die-hard fans, only one stands up. Yes, midichlorians is a bad idea, and it virtually trashes the mysticism of the Force. But I can see what persuaded the story writers to it. The Jedi Council must grant discipleship to Annakin Skywalker, and the mystical hunches of Qui-Gon are not acceptable as proof of his suitability. It is a major gaffe, and shows that the Jedi Council itself was wrongly conceived. Lucas should have seen that midichlorians are the antithesis of everything that Star Wars stands for. Maybe there's some truth in the charge that Lucas has sold out, lost the original vision, moved over to the dark side of the Force (i.e. succumbed to commercialism). But there is still enough of that vision left to make TPM a truly memorable film. The pod race is said to go on too long, but I didn't think so. People forget the unending battle sequences in the original trilogy The only other issue I would like to bring up is the ugliness of the aliens. It has become a regular feature for science fiction films to feature ugly aliens, and it points to a chronic dearth of vision among such filmmakers. Stars Wars may have started it all, and it has a lot to answer for in that regard. Why should the beautiful future be marred by ugly aliens? These creatures aren't low-life. In fact in most cases they are superior to humans. The model should have been Spock from Star Trek. His alien-ness is suggested by his pointed ears and that is enough. The rest is left to our imagination and that's how it should be. It comes across through his excessive logicalness, his quizzical reaction to human ways, his posture, his special abilities etc. The aura of alien-ness is very strong with Spock; it's almost non-existent with Jar Jar Binks. Spock was the winning grace of Star Trek. Jar Jar Binks, and indeed all other alien life forms in the Star Wars saga, are merely eyesores and annoyances. An alien is supposed to inspire wonder. What has ugliness got to do with that?",7,10,17,17 October 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A hero for the New Agers
","I watched this film on the opening night, and I was extremely perplexed walking out. The first thing that puzzled me was how on earth the film got away with a PG rating. I figured it this way. It was trying to be a kids adventure film, but was so poor that it needed to compensate through over the top violence and horror. So my puzzlement was how on earth Lucas and Spielberg managed to bend the arms of the censors to get their PG rating, which allowed them to keep on marketing the film as children’s fare. And the other thing that puzzled me was that the movie was over before it had even started. I hadn’t noticed a story starting anywhere, so I was wondering how the movie could have finished. In other words, there was no film, just a blaze of action, and then suddenly the lights coming on. I heard someone comment on the way out, “I’ve never seen anything like that before.” I don’t know if she meant it in the same way as I did, but it was exactly my sentiment. I had never seen anything like that before! A film that’s not a film at all! Just an excuse to put one action sequence after another. In fact, the censors should have banned the film on account of its having no story. How could Lucas and Spielberg get away with this?! The overall impression I got was that there’s something very rotten going on in the film world now.The above response was instantaneous, and it was before all the legend around this film had grown up. I didn’t think the film was going to be a hit. In fact, I thought it was going to fall flat on its face. But the film went on to break box-office records everywhere, and after the legend had cemented, I started to have different feelings. I reasoned that I may have missed something the first time, and after reading the umpteenth glowing review the film began to look better in my memory. However a recent viewing helped to dispel all these false notions. It must be stated out and out. This film is bad!!! There’s nothing more to be said about it, but there’s a lot to be said about the audience. I think it’s high time that we said a few things about the “movie brats” and the popular appeal that they court. The thing started proper with Star Wars in 1977, and this is where the Raiders phenomenon begins really. Star Wars is an equally bad movie, but it had a few things going for it. It was presented as a myth, or fairy tale, for the modern age, and it worked too. Three reasons for this. One, the groundbreaking special effects gave it an epic quality, exactly in keeping with the space mythology being presented. Two, the Hollywood narrative was totally disbanded, giving way for an episodic structure. This helped the myth-making, because without a narrative drive people could read whatever they liked into the movie. And three, the notion of an omnipotent “force”, with both a good and dark side, captured the imagination of a world moving towards “new ageism”. So, Star Wars started it all, and the “new age” of the Hollywood blockbuster had begun. These films don’t rely on the traditional virtues of film anymore. Their aim is no wow audiences with something else, more specifically, the expensive, special effects laden set piece. They cater to the New Age mindset of “me me me”. People don’t go to the watch the stories of other people anymore. They go to participate in the megalomania of the filmmakers who were making inflated films with inflated budgets and inflated subjects. It was the “me me me” for the filmmakers, and the vicarious “me me me” for the viewers. In short, the pornography of self worth. And Raiders is only another early landmark in this trend.Lucas and Spielberg claim to be reviving the B movie adventure serials of the thirties, but there is something horribly ingenuous here. B movies are cheaply done, purely escapist, and never meant to draw attention to themselves. A film like Raiders does nothing but draw attention to itself. It’s only an excuse to use the episodic structure, so that one set-piece can be followed by another without worrying about character or plot. But all this doesn’t explain why Raiders became so popular. I guess the secret lies in the hero – Indiana Jones. When Star Wars kicked off the whole thing, there was an epic but no hero. Luke Skywalker is in no sense a hero. Only Hans Solo has a semblance of heroic about him, but was much too roguish. I guess the original idea was to get Harrison Ford a new vehicle so that he could be a braver and less cynical Hans Solo. So that’s my theory. Raiders is only a continuation of Star Wars, supplying the hero which the first film sorely lacked. So Indiana Jones comes along, and the definitive American hero for the “new age” is born. He is up to his neck in Hollywood excess and that’s all that matters.So don’t be fooled by all these reviews here that praise this film to the skies, calling it escapist fun. There may have been some thrills for the audience back in 1981, but most of the excitement was from the audacity of breaking with tradition, ignoring story and engagement with the characters, concentrating on spectacle and excess, and participating in an experience of concerted megalomania. After Star Wars, this film really cemented the ground for Hollywood excess. Most of the people here are not judging the film itself. When people say that Star Wars is good, I think they are in their New Age pious mood. The same sort of thing when they say that Raiders is good.",1,51,122,25 October 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," Cinematic catastrophe
","Watching this movie was a strange experience. It's like the producer has given us the sensationalist premise of environmental catastrophe, provided us with all eye candy of special effects, and then told us to fill in the gaps my writing a story to fit it all in. It's quite an easy task because there is so much potential for a good story and dramatic scenes, and while I was watching the movie I was already anticipating these fantastically dramatic scenes that were bound to come up but never did. It begs the question, with all these possibilities for a good story, why did not the makers of this film write one. Because there is absolutely no story that really touches you, and no dramatic scene that really moves you. It does the legwork of introducing characters and inserting plot elements. But that's where it stays because nothing gets done with them. It's an absolute waste of a fantastic premise and great special effects. Since 'special effects does not a movie make', this gets the lowest rating in my book.",1,1,4,12 February 2011
Mamma Mia!," Greece, the Musical!
","Agreed that Mamma Mia is a fantastically crafted musical, with amazing energy, top class music, mesmerising song and dance numbers and great central performances. But can all that distract us from a horrendously immoral story at the core? What is going on here? It clearly glamorises promiscuity and the rejection of family values, and to an extent that has never been seen beyond the bounds of pornography. Why is the music of ABBA framing this sordid tale? Couldn't they have a normal story and still make it fun? I'm afraid not, and I'll spell out the reasons below.ABBA is cheese to begin with. 'Nothing more to say / No more ace to play'?!! They were a Swedish group with little English trying to break the Anglo-Saxon market, and the result was pure cheese. But with four people bursting with musical talent, the cheese became irresistible too. This music was different from everything else on the market. Where music in general was losing its grammar, busy rocking and rolling, going through punk, hip hop, grunge, etc etc, ABBA stuck to the basics of structure. Each ABBA song is a masterpiece of composition, worthy to be studied next to Bach and Beethoven in my opinion. And such meticulous grammar does not work without cheese. I can't imagine Winner Takes It All being sung with feisty lyrics. 'Nothing more to say / Go ahead, make my day'? It just doesn't work. Cheese was an integral part of ABBA songs. We just got used to it.ABBA music was in need of a serious shake-up. It sounds good, but it's also stiflingly strait-jacketed. For thirty years we've been listening to perfect compositions, and don't we just wish that it would let its hair down! This is where the filmmakers of Mamma Mia come in. I believe that they are responding to this aching popular need. The songs are sung in a more spontaneous manner, and put into a story where the energy flows. But how to offset the cheese? This, I realise, was a major problem for the makers. If the songs are cheesy to begin with, how cheesy is it to put them in a musical where they appear to be part of the story? The story had to be as feisty as possible. It needed to plumb the depths of liberal and permissive society. Otherwise it would be laughed off the planet. And that's what the story of Mamma Mia does too. We have the mother not knowing who the father of her daughter is, and yet all three candidates turn up at the wedding of the daughter. After all the guilt and angst has served its plot purposes, we have both mother and daughter being cool about the mother's immoral past, and in fact celebrating it. The daughter cancels her wedding, and presumably embraces the immoral lifestyle of her mother. So the whole father thing was just a ruse to have a story with a lot of song and dance. It appears that normally these people have banished fatherhood from the earth, and then only bring up the prehistoric concept when they want to make a musical. I think that is as subversive as you can possibly get.And it works too. The energy of the film is unbelievable. And it was exactly this energy that was needed for the thing to click. Would the people involved have been as enthusiastic if they had been working with tread-of-the-mill Cinderella story? I don't think so. The hot cake story at the center is the energising force. In the end we are just about distracted from the luridness of the story. We are immersed into the fun of it all, and in cinematic terms that spells success. The music too sounds far better than their ABBA versions.But we are going to be sorry in the end. Sorry that we took part in this celebration of promiscuous matriarchy. There is no doubt about it. This film is plumbing the depths of decadence. Greece is where Western civilisation began. By the evidence of this film, it is also where it ends.",10,1,2,21 November 2010
Avatar," A vision of hell
","The real theme of Avatar is the megalomania of the director. He thinks he can create a world from scratch, and he thinks of this world as Paradise. The only problem is that beauty comes from within. Bloated with megalomania as he is, his vision of Paradise comes across as Hell instead. I found the viewing of Pandora excruciating. There was a persistent sense of nausea throughout. It was meant to be the essence of beauty. But blue men with long tails undulating behind them are a utter perversity to the eyes. The garish plant life reeked of poison. The animals combined insect, reptile and mammal, bringing out the worst features in each. How anyone can conceive of this concoction as beautiful is beyond me. Compared to this the slimy aliens in Cameron's earlier films are tame.In truth, I am suspicious of anyone who calls Pandora beautiful. My theory is this: There is something ugly inside that is compels them to say that Pandora is beautiful. They take into consideration the budget of the film, the fact that it's made by the 'king of the world', that it stands as a testament to human ingenuity (technology, CGI and so on), that the film becomes the byword for hype, that it promotes the cult of celebrity, etc. In other words, those who find Pandora beautiful are also those who idolize the megalomania of Cameron. It's all a matter of worshipping excess, and if you do, you find Pandora beautiful. Otherwise you say, Hey, why are those slimy tentacles sticking out of all those animals on that planet? Yuck! The rest is a thinly disguised critique of the American invasion of Iraq, or more generally the military industrial complex. But of course it is hypocrisy through and through. Hollywood excess is an integral part of the military industrial complex, and Cameron is at the vanguard of Hollywood excess. He's a hypocrite, and no wonder his vision comes across as so ugly. Of course, not many people will say so. Not if they are worshipping at the altar of pride and excess. So Cameron taps into the general malaise and makes a lot of money. That's all there is to Avatar. It's a testament to greed and megalomania. In this universe of excess there is a 'paradise', which the film tries to recreate. If you live in that universe you will find the vision beautiful. If you don't, it is the very definition of repulsive.",1,14,23,17 October 2010
The Matrix," Disguised Scientology?
","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of 'appearance and reality' in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist ('We only accept what science tells us'), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was ('Does God play dice?'). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of 'freeing the mind' are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the 'Being and Time' for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.",3,6,11,22 September 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Grossly overrated
","This film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this 'film' from almost every quarter – from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The 'Force' embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of 'new hope'. And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects.When people say they like Empire, what I think they really mean is that thy like Star Wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping. Because Empire is nothing but embellishment. They're not judging the film itself. The ideal situation would have been if Star Wars remained as a standalone fairy tale. Fairy tales end, and they leave us with the aura of 'happily ever after'. They don't go on and on and become sagas, and if they did that would totally destroy the aura. Empire is the first mistaken step towards saga, and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth. There is nothing else to be told, and that's why the film is so bad. One boring battle joined to another boring battle, and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever. The strain tells. Everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. The third film, The Return of the Jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story. The prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background. But Empire is caught in no man's land. It is bad, and it should be exposed as such. All this pretending isn't healthy, I don't think.",1,38,141,17 October 2010
Back to the Future," The definitive time travel adventure
","The secret of Back To The Future is its madcap pace. Any film about time travel must be like that, because any pause will expose the implausibility of it all, and that’s disastrous. The first Terminator couldn’t afford to stop anywhere because if it did the plot becomes laughable. Non-stop action is easier to handle than comedy, because with comedy you are always mired in the time-travel ramifications, instead of side-stepping it as they do in an action flick. It’s even more difficult for Back To The Future because it takes those ramifications head on. The hero has to save himself from non-existence after he has accidentally stopped his parents from meeting each other. So it’s not just pace that makes this film work, but also ingenuity. The plot is devilishly ingenious, and ingenuity keeps popping up in other forms too throughout the film, in cross-cultural references, in incestuous asides, in time travel in-jokes etc. it’s all helped by perfect casting and great performances, particularly Christopher Lloyd as the mad scientist Doc Brown, also good were Michael J. Fox, Lea Thomson and Crispin Glover. The cinematography is excellent too. Walking back in time appears palpable. The ending is lame, however. There was no need to have a significantly altered present when Marty comes back home. The whole point was not to change the present, so the film loses a lot of credibility here. But it doesn’t take away from the joyous ride of the last 2 hours. This film became one of the most popular films of all time, and it’s on the strength of its quality alone.The only thing I don’t understand is why they decided to make a sequel. When I sat down to watch BTTF 2 I knew I was heading for a disaster zone. I mean, if it took so much effort and ingenuity just to suspend disbelief in the first one, it’s an impossible task to keep it going for two more films. Sooner or later we are bound to be troubled by plausibility issues, and that spoils everything. I was absolutely right, and watching 2 was depressing and excruciating. Mind you, I can’t commend the makers highly enough for trying, but what’s impossible is impossible. 2 contains an even more ingenious plot, but it still ends up as utterly ridiculous, and indeed becomes an insult to the first. The first allowed us to indulge in the fantasy of “what if”. The second has us tangled in a mathematical web of “ifs” and “thens”, and this leaves no scope for fantasy. Gems like Back To The Future need to be preserved from the contamination of sequelitis. But Hollywood is a place where money rules, so I shouldn’t be fussy.",8,1,1,21 October 2010
