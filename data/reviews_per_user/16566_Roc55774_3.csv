It," A Real Review of IT...
","This is going to a realist review for this movie called IT. It the movie, is pretty good.This movie is one of the few scary horror movies that had a plot and a story.I seen reviews were people said that the movie was not scary enough and the clown did not scare them scare them, well these are the same people who went home and slept with all the lights on that night after the movie.The movie IT mixes well horror,drama,and comedy without losing focus of itself and the audience.The cast was great along with the music.The move IT will be one of those movies people will keep talking about until Part 2 is released.",8,3,6,24 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Real Review of Batman vs Superman
","Let me be honest about this movie. The only thing that saved this movie from being the worst superhero movie ever filmed was the half baked team-up fight at the end of the movie. Ben Affleck's Batman is good not great . This new Superman is average at best .But the worst characters that ruined this entire movie and whatever franchise this disaster wants to create are Lois Lane and who ever Jessie Eisenberg is trying to imitate . It's beyond stupidity that Superman is every where to save Lois Lane but can't find his own mother in a city , this movie deserves a zero just for that . Jessie Eisenberg was platinum Terrible in this movie , platinum terrible . It's a shame Wonder Woman appeared in this movie for 10 minutes and was the best thing during this 3 hour or whatever run of the entire movie . This DC franchise is dead.",2,1,6,25 August 2016
Godzilla," Real Review of Godzilla
","This is a real review of the movie Godzilla. Anyone here or you know personally giving this movie a rating over 2 , don't know anything about movies.They probably think Rambo was the best movie they ever saw. Godzilla is a lazy movie. By lazy , it's made to fill in 50 minutes of boring human dialogue , then show you dark , dusty , foggy images of Godzilla and the monsters it suppose to be fighting . This was a complete waste of 150 million or what ever this movie cost. It should have cost 100,000, just so the director could pay using the U.S. Army equipment and the 4 or 5 people that had dialogue in the movie.I don't understand how people would talk about Godzilla when it's daylight outside, then when you see Godzilla in the next scene,it's raining and fog and total blackness is all over the city . This is cheap movie making . When the movie is over , you left with, who are these people hugging after the city is wrecked ? And why does the camera keeps showing this weird kid who makes the same face throughout the movie, is the kid related or something to Godzilla??I didn't see any fangs or fire coming out his mouth.This was a total waste of a movie and time filmed . How the star Godzilla don't get anytime in his own movie is a million dollar question. don't rent , download or get a free copy of this.",1,5,14,5 July 2014
