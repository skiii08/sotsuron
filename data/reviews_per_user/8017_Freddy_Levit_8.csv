Vertigo," SUSPENSE, SURPRISE and SUBSTANCE.......the work of the Master Of SUSPENSE - the unmatched classic, 'Vertigo'
","Arguably the greatest Director in world cinema history, Alfred Hitchcock could very well have single handedly changed the face of the horror and thriller genres forever. His influence on cinema - his technique and style in particular - have inspirationally spawned countless copy cats, most famous of which have been the likes of John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Wes Craven. He instilled famous images in our heads - images that will scare future generations of showers, birds, ropes and airplanes. Many wouldn't even know he has done so. His films are instantly recognizable around the world. What is most fascinating, is that he could overwhelm you with suspense without much to it, for he didn't need blood, gore or very loud music to get the audience scared, because it was the timing, subtle camera movements, use of light and the extraordinary music that made audiences around the world tremble. Hitchcock's vision set standards much like David Lean set it for the epic scope and John Huston for adventure - much like Spielberg and Lucas would set it for the imagination. 'Vertigo' is the perfect example of his gift to the world. It is his masterful and complete compilation of the standards that people recognize him by.It is about a San Fransisco Private Eye named Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) who following a police chase, where his partner falls to his death off a building, develops a fear of heights and is forced to retire. To his surprise, he is one day approached by an old friend from school who begs him to investigate the strange happenings of his wife Madelaine who he claims is possessed by some ghost. Initially hesitating, Scottie soon is personally drawn to Madelaine's situation, following her around San Fransisco. However, nothing prepares him for what lies ahead when lust, deception, conspiracy and murder unravel in a complex plot, in which he is determined to find the truth.I believe 'Vertigo' was Hitchock's definitive master work, because none captured his brilliant touch quite like it. Everything that you could throw into a suspenseful thriller was in it. Above all the story was the most engaging. The actors were flawless. The music and cinematography were splendid. None captured the essence of 'fear' as powerfully as it did. It is in my opinion a PERFECT film. From start to finish, you can't take your eyes off the screen. 'James Stewart' is perhaps the most mesmerizing and commanding presence ever to grace the silver screen. You could feel his anger, excitement, fear and sadness through his famous eyes and gestures. The scenery of San Fransisco was magnificent and truly added to the already overwhelming atmosphere Hitchcock is famous for. Music was never over indulgent and suited incredibly well with the happenings on-screen.What really impresses me is that few films have had as many plot twists and turns that 'Vertigo' showcases. You would learn something new every time you'd watch it. None have such an engaging plot as does this beautiful, atmospheric Mona Lisa of a film.Recommendations are useless. SEE THIS MOVIE NOW if you haven't done so. Forget about our contemporary film directors that excite you. No film in my opinion excites quite like Hitchcock's definitive masterpiece 'Vertigo'. It has everything you could hope for. This is a classic in every meaning of the word and should be a definite addition to everyone's video library.Hitchcock...........we miss you.....................forever!",10,8,14,24 April 2005
12 Angry Men," Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....
","........Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor......'Is it possible?' - Juror #8/Henry Fonda",10,418,487,11 January 2005
Judgment at Nuremberg," It wasn't just Nazi Germany to blame.......it was the world! A cinematic triumph!
","Since the Holocaust of World War II that was responsible for the deaths of more than 6 million Jews, there have been numerous films made for the purpose of showing and educating the world about the genocide, most powerful and famous of which being 'Schindler's List' which captured the intense atmosphere of what it would have been like to be a Jew in those times. Its graphic imagery, its superb character development, its powerful symbolism and its epic true story shocked the world upon its release. It is THE definitive Holocaust film and a masterpiece beyond all proportions. Long before 'Schindler's List' however, there was a film that was just as controversial, a film that didn't so much emphasize on the struggle of the Jews during the holocaust, but more so on the war criminals who butchered them close to extinction and the trials that sent them for life imprisonment. But unlike a lot of films regarding this era, this court room drama didn't just pin it on the Nazis, but questioned the world about the tragedy. It turns out, that the three hours 'Judgment At Nuremberg' ran for were some of the most engaging, hair-raising and heart-wrenching experiences of my life.In the final stages of the Nuremberg trials, four men stand for trial surrounding their crimes against humanity - particularly based around the Nuremberg laws in which people were being sterilized to prevent them from continuing their blood line and where people were sent to their deaths for having sexual relations with anyone other than Aryans. Most of the controversy lies around Dr. Ernst Janning, a pioneer in the study of law and a humanitarian who dedicated his life to justice, who gave the executive decisions to send the people to their graves. The film starts as an evidence based trial with its witnesses and official documents, but becomes a moral play for the audience.The film may have cost a tenth of the budget of 'Schindler's List'. Most of it is in a court room, but you will witness here a film that can manifest visuals more powerful than any you've ever seen before just from the dialog that is spoken. It is in a court room, but your mind is not. The questions of humanity seep through like a torrent of raging bulls.It's brilliant, haunting and inspiring. Like 'Schindler's List', black and white photography was crucial for creating a feel of the time on which it was based. Perfect casting enabled the intense drama to take its toll.Maximilian Schell as defense attorney for the war criminals and Burt Lancaster as Ernst Janning give the performances of their careers. Everybody in the cast, including Spencer Tracy as the 'Justice', Richard Widmark as the prosecutor determined to find it and Marlene Dietrich as an emotionally tough widow gave their all. The chemistry in the court room is combustion at its best. Everybody has a commanding presence. You feel like you're there! Little music was played throughout, but what was played was there to enhance the authentic German surroundings. What particularly impressed me was a scene where Spencer Tracy walks the streets of Nuremberg and find his way around the Roman inspired 'Luitpoldhain', the famous venue for a lot of Hitler's rallies. As Tracy admires the Roman Architecture, he then looks at the balcony from where Hitler once stood to yell out his nationalist and genocidal speeches and imagines what it must have felt like, a sample of one of his speeches is played in the background and we imagine how powerful this man must have been - he was an emperor and a very sick man. The most surprising and mind boggling aspect of the film was the use of real footage from the concentration camps to which the Jews were sent. For the time in which the film was released, this must have been shockingly controversial.While most of the film surrounds the conviction of the war criminals, the film also points its finger at its audience. WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT OCCURRED. I totally agree, and the film makes strong emphasis on this towards the end. Whilst the war criminals were directly responsible for sending the Jews to their deaths, we are nevertheless responsible for letting it happen. The new generation may not be responsible for what happened 60+ years ago, but it's responsible for what's currently happening in the world. 'Judgement at Nuremberg' is a film not only about the holocaust. It is universal and is just as relevant today as it always was. That's the power of the film - that it makes you think.It is a perfect companion to 'Schindler's List' and a true classic.With an all-star cast, colossal performances, a mesmerizing script and a great story, this is one tour-de-force you can't miss. Thank you Stanley Kramer for this triumph of cinema!",10,1,3,16 January 2006
Batman Begins," The fact this film received 8.6 suggests just how the public has lost their touch with film.
","Of course, when in comparison to many of the films released this year, Batman Begins stand higher than others, and I might say that as a stand alone film it is quite entertaining. However, it would be blasphemous to consider this even a door step in comparison with Tim Burton's masterpiece, which starred Michael Keaton in his signature role. The original, a realization of a comic legend, only received 7.4 on the IMDb scale. It confuses me how the general public thinks these days. Are they comparing Batman Begins with the other films released during the year, or are they being serious about it exceeding the original? Here is what I think about Batman Begins............It doesn't even feel like a Batman movie. It misses the point completely. And I hate the excuses of 'making a new Batman film for the new generation'. THE NEW GENERATION ALSO NEED GOOD FILMS. I agree with the casting of Christian Bale, a great actor and once a child prodigy (most memorable in Spielberg's Empire Of The Sun), however he alone could not save this film from disaster. Christopher Nolan is a respectful director, but did he really think he could create his own Batman? Or was it a cash-in opportunity? The Batmobile - every time I looked at it, it made my face grimace. I understand the director wanted a modern prototype of Batman, but this.......what a contraption. The Batman suit did it worst for me though. The new re-done Batman symbol is pathetic. It looked more like the Nazi Eagle than the original symbol that really looked like a Bat. Why does Nolan require Batman to be modernized anyway? It is the Gothic, 1950's film noir style of the original film that made Batman a household name. The whole atmosphere so vividly created by Tim Burton in the original was breathtaking and bought a comic book to life. Christopher Nolan wanted a more serious approach to Batman, for it to be more realistic. The fact Batman is wearing a Bat suit is ridiculous enough anyway, and so the fact that the director sees the legend of Batman as serious totally misses the point of THE BATMAN LEGEND. It is just a comic book, and so the unbelievable can still be believable. It doesn't have to be explained, because it is simply fiction. Like the larger than life Gotham City Tim Burton vividly bought to life and much like in the comic book itself, it is just a story that takes us to another world - and utilizes our imagination. We don't have to make Batman real. It's like explaining how Superman flies.Although the film ran for well over two hours, and felt way overlong, the characters were poorly developed. I felt, walking out of the theater, like I didn't get to know the characters. It didn't feel like they were communicating in any way to the audience. Alfred, played well by Michael Caine just didn't click with me.nothing to do with the veteran actor. He just didn't have enough screen time or dialog for me to feel anything between him and Bruce Wayne. Also, the death of Wayne's parents in Batman Begins compared to the same death in the original, is like comparing the song 'Rain drops are fall on my head' to 'adagio for strings'. Nolan was attempting to make a dramatic, touching scene and failed miserably. It seemed almost ridiculous  like an episode of Bold and the Beautiful. They should have made this scene the focal point of the film, so we could feel Bruce Wayne's pain and understand his Legend. I thought 'Scarecrow' was an effective villain, and he scared the hell out of me first time he revealed himself. But he too could not have saved this film from inevitable down fall.Worst of all, fighting scenes were atrocious. Unlike the Tim Burton classic, I couldn't see what the bloody hell was going on on screen. Close-ups, over-layered by shaky cameras, over-layered by quick-cuts so as we don't see how well the actors really fight - what a joke. Sure the story is great, but we came to see Batman kick the enemies butts. Some nice CGI effects were added to the film well, but they could not assist Batman in anyway, because they literally weren't really needed. I think people have either forgotten Tim Burton's unmatched atmosphere of Batman or what makes a good film. From Beginning to End I didn't feel like I was watching a Batman movie - it felt more like a normal action blockbuster we see too much of. It missed the whole Gothic exterior that made the original film larger than life and at times scary. The actors, including Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all did great jobs, apart from a few. It was the sets designs, the suit, the Batmobile, the normal look of everything that made this just a boring entry that shouldn't even be called 'Batman'. It is definitely better than Val Kilmer and George Clooney's mediocre sequels. However for this film to get a higher score than the original is like spitting in Tim Burton's face and forgetting the greatness of how film used to be made. Let's not forget one of the most memorable movie scores of all time from the original that assisted to define THE BATMAN. I can only predict that Batman Begins, only in a few years, will be laughable.",3,12,24,19 June 2005
K-19: The Widowmaker," It is funny to see how most, if not all comments, except the American ones regarding K-19 really praised it and really enjoyed it. It must be half a century of propaganda, not Harrison Ford's accent.
","K-19 is a unique entry with a poignant portrayal of the other side of the Iron Curtain, showing the rest of the world the courage and the honour of the Russians to their mother land. Those who think of Russians, usually think of blood thirsty killing beasts who drink Vodka all day, but clearly this is just propaganda. I have Russian background and I have grown up around ethnics, and Russians are no different than the general public. It is American propaganda that has taken the rest of the world from understanding the Russian people. In K-19, the Russians are finally portrayed as human beings in the most harshest of all circumstances. This is not an action movie and it was not intended to be one. Most of the American comments shown here on Imdb are ridiculous. They clearly show the American expectations in a movie: It has to be a blow up, explosion filled, guns and bullets, kill your enemy blockbuster to make it into their best films ever list. K-19 however did not want to impress the Americans with special effects (it seems to the general American public that special effects are all that make quality movies these days) but instead wanted to show the world that Russian soldiers were not cold blooded murderers and were not war thirsty, but were soldiers under extreme circumstances - to show the struggle on the other side and to show the fear of death and the courage and heroics in preventing nuclear war, subsequently sparking World War III.I was really impressed that at least some of the American comments were realistic, for anybody who understands cinema would classify this as a 'masterpiece'. I have come across many hilariously stupid and ridiculous American comments where they think they know what they are talking about and the thing is, they don't. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson pulled off a brilliant realistic performance. In my opinion, their accents were very well done (I am Russian, so I would know) and the direction was splendid (a benchmark in sub film history with its claustrophobic sense and close direction). I felt really sorry for the characters, especially for the Nuclear Reactor Officer. The Kirov Orchestra pulled off one of the greatest soundtracks that I have ever heard (really powerful and striking pieces) and the general Russian feel throughout the film was 'Authentic'.I was truly struck by this film. It sent shivers down my spine. The settings, the story telling, the performances, the direction, the music, the tension, the interaction and chemistry between the characters, the authenticity and best of all the cast truly made this film a 'masterpiece'. Thank you to one great 'American' film director (Kathryn Bigelow) for waking up and seeing the Russians in a different light.This movies is certainly a 10/10.",10,230,317,22 November 2002
The Untouchables," Alfred Hitchcock never knew his apprentice to films. A shame!
","No other director in the world better suggests Hitchcock in his/her work than Brian de Palma. Directors like Henri-Georges Clouzot, Polanski, Craven, Hooper and Francois Truffautt made indisputable footnotes and references to Hitchcock's unusual, controversial, innovative and redefining master works, although at the same time disguising their films in their own style. But Hitchcock inspired one director in particular so much to the point where he literally continued his work. De Palma in effect completely copied his teacher to such an extent as to make new Hitchcock films. This doesn't bother me as it usually would. Why? Because Hitchcock's films are the most engaging, entertaining and suspenseful ever made. Rarely have I watched films where following their conclusion, I wanted more. If Brian de Palma knows how to pull it off, then why not? He knows the formula. When he made films like The Sisters, Obsession and Dressed to Kill he must have been trying to cover up the fact that Hitchcock was coming to the end of his career, because they're almost as good as any Hitchcock film.Which brings us to De Palma's most expertly crafted film to date, 'The Untouchables'. Nothing psychological like most of his master's films, it is however very paranoid and dark, attributes that haunt Hitchcock's films from start to finish. Forgive my comparison, but you understand I look indifferently at these two directors. I'll shut up for now.Paranoia is perhaps the theme of this film about Al Capone from the perspective of the man who brought him down, Elliot Ness. While Al Capone (played with menace by Robert de Niro) as emperor of 1920s Chicago during prohibition makes violence a way of life, nobody could stand in his way. Illegal alcohol responsible for his power and employ of the government becomes an honest cop's obsession to bringing the gangster down. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) would risk his life for the American dream of justice and freedom - a quality rare in those times. Following an unsuccessful attempt to bringing the criminal down in an alcohol raid, with the public laughing behind his back, he meets his guide, mentor and the toughest cop in town named Jim Malone (Sean Connery in his definitive performance) a man with knowledge and important connections with a firm fist of an Irishman. It is Malone's loyalty, honesty and hard as nails attitude that takes Elliot Ness deeper than he had ever gone. Along for the ride is an accountant turned Untouchable Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and an uncorrupted prodigy marksman Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia). Together, as they head deeper to uncover Capone's racket, violence becomes a cat and mouse game with each side exchanging roles. But as it becomes increasingly more difficult to prove Capone's involvements, following alcohol raids, due to the paranoia and fear of losing power, he resorts to rely on his henchman who craves for a hit, especially when it involves Ness' family and Malone, the man who knows the darkest corners of Chicago. However, as Elliot Ness and his Untouchables hit a wall, the possible ultimately becomes impossible...........unless! This isn't your typical gangster movie. It has a tempo about it that wreaks of paranoia. It has the same suspicious and unsettling menace that pollutes Hitchcock's great espionage classics like 'The 39 Steps', 'Foreign Correspondent', 'Saboteur', 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', 'North By Northwest', 'Torn Curtain' and 'Topaz'. In other words, see these films if you liked 'The Untouchables' and you will find many scenes in those films that inspired some in de Palma's masterpiece. There is a scene in the film which stands on its own as a technically flawless achievement - the scene at the train station steps with the Peckinpah inspired shootout between Capone's and Ness' men which incorporates Eisenstein's famous pram scene from Battleship Potemkin and the brilliant technical execution of a Hitchcock 'footstep sound' technique. Here, de Palma was paying tribute to men who guided him in film making. The cast in the film is an achievement in itself. De Niro's devotion to playing hoodlums in his career has type cast him as one. His face has become synonymous with crime, and that's why his role works. He gives Capone such a one dimensional persona that you easily hate him. Kevin Costner playing Ness was good for the part. You could identify with his frustration, but in the scenes opposite Connery and Garcia, he was merely a mirage. Connery's performance was one of the most electrifying performances of the century. His tough Irishman's command is so sharp, intimidating and out right entertaining that it doesn't surprise me that the Academy Awards were blown away. Garcia's kid from a tough neighborhood role gives him a silent mystery (a role Charles Bronson tackled many times) and it makes him such an interesting character, because he isn't a criminal like he could of been coming from those parts of town. Charles Martin Smith adds comic relief and is a nice touch to a serious thriller. Oh, I can go on about this film, but it would be a crime not to mention Ennio Morricone's suspense symphony which is a work comparable to Bernard Herrmann's work. Instead of composing a score for the film's period setting, Morricone utilizes electronic sounds and blends them with an orchestra creating a kind of comic book quirky feel all the while maintaining the suspense. A definite product of the 80s, but it works - perfectly. The Untouchables not only a gangster movie. It is one of the most paranoid and suspenseful film-noirs ever made, as good even as Hitchcock's 'Notorious'. If you are new to Hitchcock or de Palma, 'The Untouchables' is a great start to your education. And if it overwhelms you to the point where you need another fix, see the Hitchcock films mentioned and witness the brilliance of a man who bestowed upon us the greatest works of art in the history of the medium.",10,2,3,18 June 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," An inspirational heartwarming experience. A Timeless Classic!
","George Bailey is a man with goals, ambitions - a man of courage, integrity and pride. But all he has ever done his whole life is assist those in need, never for a second thinking about himself. Wanting to see the world before he sets off to college for an architect degree, he finds that he can't let his town crumble against the miserable, hateful, greedy and powerful 'Potter' and so he decides to stay. His father passes away, and so he must find a way to run the 'Loans' business that his father has kept from the mad man 'Potter'. All goes well for Bailey - a beautiful wife, a few children and a lot of friends. Although still handing out loans like his father before him, he pursues his dream of building and constructs a home village with affordable houses despite Potter's mass influence on the township. Unfortunately for Bailey, things begin to point downhill following the Depression and later bankruptcy where Bailey just can't handle the weight of burden of all the people's money he cannot repay. He comes to the harrowing conclusion that he should never have been born and decides to leave his family and friends and take his own life off a bridge. But the world cannot dispose of itself such a man, so god sends an Angel on a mission to get its wings, or better yet to save George Bailey's life. The Angel shows George what life would have been like had he not been born at all and of what became of the people he took dearly. Miserable under Potter's absolute influence, the town looks like an over indulgent, over spent, money making machine. George gets a glimpse of his own powerful influence on his friends and family and realises just what a wonderful life he really had.Few films have portrayed the value (not the meaning) of life like 'It's a Wonderful Life' has. In contemporary times, we have been fed with recycled stories such as 'The Family Man' and 'It can happen to you', but none have captured the raw beauty of life like the original, 'It's a wonderful Life'- its success partly due to its simplicity. And it sustains your attention from start to finish due to its simple and riveting storytelling. Sets aren't big, the story is quite small and the film is in black and white. What makes this film stand taller than others is the great dialog between the characters which consistently remains on the story throughout the film and not on irrelevant topics - this is what keeps us glued to the screen (unlike with modern films, most of the dialog is blabber about nothing). The acting is superb from the whole cast, but you have got to hand it to James Stewart for one of the best performances of his career portraying the discouraged George Bailey - arguably his best performance - and one of the best performances you will see in any film. What I really love about this film is the lack of music, which gives a sense of realism to the story, like we are there with the characters in George Bailey's world.Frank Capra creates an unforgettable atmospheric experience that remains tattooed in your memory years after viewing. The outdated effects aside, this film has stood the test of time as a timeless classic. The direction was subtle and superb - rarely equaled and I think this film is best in Black and White, even though they already had color in 1939, seven years before this masterpiece was released.I recommend this film to anybody who feels down and depressed, sad and lonely. It really makes you think about the importance and beauty of this life in which you are living. All I can say is that I will be watching this film yearly until the day that I die due to its poignancy. A real classic in cinema history. It really is a wonderful Life!",10,34,50,10 January 2005
Blade Runner," A warning and reflection. A film subtly compelling. An experience 'More Human Than Human'
","How much has the world changed since 1982? The computer wars were beginning and arcade games were the craze, yet our lives were at a height of sociability. Things were simple for the sake of simplicity. Life seemed to make more sense. But our minds were unconsciously drifting away from reality, whilst reality slowly made its way towards the visions of this powerful film. 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', written by famous American Science Fiction author Phillip K Dick, was adapted to the screen by Sir Ridley Scott into 'Blade Runner'. Ridley's masterful transformation of Dick's nocturnal vision to celluloid, confused audiences who misunderstood a world which would seem more like reality only ten years later in the technology boom of the 90s. The film gained 'turkey' status upon its release and was quickly abandoned as a mess, soon doomed to gain dust in relentless video libraries.Ten years later the world only further resembled Blade Runner's scary vision. Upon its 1992 re-release, tickets sold out before they even hit the box-office. Even critic Roger Ebert rephrased his 1982 statement claiming it a masterpiece. And here began the Legacy of the most acclaimed Cult Film. Film critics around the world named it the most important science-fiction of all time with Kubrick's 2001 - and the most visually mesmerizing.The film follows the enlightenment of a Blade Runner (a cop) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in Los Angeles 2019, a dystopia falling apart from permanent drizzling twilight, rare natural life and where technology dictates existence. Following early retirement from his police unit, Deckard is forced into a desperate assignment by his ex-boss 'Bryant'. Four Replicants (humanoids) have escaped from an 'off-world colony', taking a shuttle back to Earth for unknown reasons. His mission: To kill all Replicants declared illegal on Earth. Deckard's unconscious approach to his job in a world deteriorating from lack of nature,sociability and eternal darkness slowly deteriorates when his eyes open to the most important questions in life. Beginning his investigations in the Pyramids of the Tyrell Corporation, responsible for manufacturing the Replicants, he meets his turning point, Rachel, who due to Deckard's Void Kompff machine (an empathy tester) is found a Replicant. Following a cold, immoral revelation to her about her origins, he is inevitably drawn to her emotionally, soon leading to his first sign of awakening, LOVE.From a cold beginning, without any sign of 'empathy' towards those around him, what Deckard finds out about Rachel, Elden Tyrell, and the so called 'EVIL' Replicants he intercepts, enable him for the first time to feel and understand Love, Hate and the preciousness of Life respectively. Roy Batty, the leader of the Replicant mutineers, played convincingly by Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, is the most important symbol in the film, and is the ultimate enlightenment in Deckard's quest for humanity in learning that no matter if you're human or not, love, compassion and empathy are the most important human characteristics, and some Replicants are 'more human than human'. Contrary to initial perception, Batty shows these characteristics and we sympathize with him, something we wouldn't usually do with an 'artificial' human, with theoretically no emotions. Tyrell becomes the focal point of human degradation, in that in his vision of technological advance, he brings humanity, morality and nature closer to extinction as he sits atop his corporation like a 'Pharoah'.Finally, there are many evidences to suggest 'Deckard' is a Replicant, and this has been immortal debate since release. Either way, the film's message remains as strong. It's filled with overwhelming symbolism and meaning, that one viewing of this art-work will be exhausting.The film's intentions are not only to question what makes us human, but it also makes strong focus on reflecting our current issues of world Conservation, technological advance and the degradation of humanity from the media, exploitation, capitalism, and the complacency and destructive nature of humanity. In Ridley Scott's vision, the Sun that gives life has been blocked out by pollution due to the dominance of technology, and dreams of Unicorns suggests we long for the past, for rarity in Nature. What one must notice is that 'Eyes' play a key symbol throughout the film in explaining this, for it appears that most are 'artificial' than not.'Blade Runner' is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and perhaps one of the most poignant films of all time. Countless copycats including 'The Fifth Element', and 'Akira' have tried to imitate his legendary vision of a dark world gone wrong, which only seems more possible as the years fly by. I am happy to see that Blade Runner is so respected and that people understand its vision. It has embedded itself into my movie collection and along with 'The Mosquito Coast', another similar film with Harrison Ford regarding humanity, is my favorite film of all time.The music composed by 'Vangelis' is God-sent, sounding so mythical and dream-like. Set designs and cinematography have rarely been equaled  marvelously detailed. The whole cast were superb in bringing their characters to life. Especially Joe Turkel (Tyrell) and Rutger Hauer who played opposites of one another beautifully. Harrison Ford was irreplaceable as the lead, showing his transformation from a cold being into an human being expertly - it just seems so natural with him. However I believe Rutger Hauer should have received the Oscar for his performance as the human like Replicant. He has a commanding presence. Sean Young, playing Rachel, was a great choice. She's stunning and projects innocence well in showing Deckard's shortcomings. This film will be in the hearts of more 'as time goes by' and will never again end up accumulating dust in forgotten sections of video libraries. It's more than a 'classic'. I recommend everybody who loves film or philosophy to watch and explore its masterful telling. I have never seen a film as movingly deep. It's a poem from beginning to end and 'more human than human'.",10,26,49,7 June 2005
