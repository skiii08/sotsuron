Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," oh, wow...
","Star Wars rocks.  This movie rocks.  Obi-Wan rocks, Amidala rocks, Qui-Gon rocks (I'd better stop right there, lest I list the entirety of the credits, and boy are they long.)  Even Jar-Jar wasn't too annoying!  I just can't express how much I like this movie, but I still feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.  George Lucas is a wonderful man.  Go see this movie.",6,1,2,19 May 1999
