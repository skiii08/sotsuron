Antz," Geared Towards Adults, Not Children.
","Antz, while appearing to be a cartoon, really is a movie geared towards adults rather than children.  Strangely enough, it is a story more out of the genre of Orwell or 'Brave New World' than the Saturday morning cartoons for children.  This is Woody Allen vs. The System.  The laughs I heard from the audience were from adults; children were silent or asking explanations from nearby adults.",3,3,7,11 October 1998
Eyes Wide Shut," GodAwful Boring.
","Despite the wonderful acting talent of Cruise and Kidman, this final work of Kubrick went off with not a bang, but a whimper.  The plot was predictable, the movie long and tedious.  Potential viewers beware:  save your dollars and wait for video, where you may fast forward through the mundane and altogether skip the mediocre and anticlimatic last few lines of dialogue.",2,0,3,16 July 1999
