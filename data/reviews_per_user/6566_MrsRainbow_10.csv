Alien 3," my favorite of the four
","I have to agree with a lot of the comments already made. If this film was not connected to the first two it would be considered a classic. I read that it was more popular in Europe than in America, which would make sense to me. Everyone I know loves Aliens and thinks I'm crazy to like A3, but I find the characters in Aliens to be comical caricatures. Newt was such a horrid idea on top of that.That said, Alien 3 is my favorite of the series. I love the setting, both as a plot idea and for how great the cinematography is. This really is more of a drama with action. I much prefer dramas to action films, which while sometimes entertaining, too often trade off good writing and character development for eye candy/mind gum.A3 is the way it should be: dark and primitive, man faced with a seemingly inconquerable enemy, armed only with his wits and his courage. I find that much more entertaining than watching a handful of 'Marines' wildly spraying gunfire.",Null,4,7,22 February 1999
The English Patient," A rebuttal for the nay side
","OK. First I must make a couple of points clear. I am in America, I am male. I am, however, also a big fan of Ralph Fiennes. I even know that it's pronounced Rafe. And despite being an American male, my tastes do not run to the I am a caricature of the ultimate male so overwhelming with testosterone that I must blow up things every five minutes and then have passionate sex with multiple women type of movie. I like dramas, I like foreign films. I also read reams of literature. My favorite movies are probably Solyaris and Lawrence of Arabia, a film which many people have compared TEP to.But I had problems with TEP. First off, comparing this to David Lean I believe to be absurd. Why? Because it has shots of the desert? There are no other possible comparisons in my view. Lawrence of Arabia was about a truly complex and interesting man, however glamorized he might be at times.But TEP had no characters worth caring for. It reminds me of a book by Don Delillo called Underworld. It's been hailed as a great American novel, but when I read it, the writing and obvious ability to use language were impressive at times, but I was not drawn into the book at all. The characters were self-centered and one-dimensional. I wouldn't care if the New York art house types in the book died and were boiled in their oil paints.I felt the same way about TEP. The characters were despicable. The tired immoralist in love with his ennui. Oh wow, I think I'll cry. I felt the film was pretentious and overbearing, another diseased child in the inbred line of film royalty, which was hailed as a masterpiece because the producers set out to make one and the critics told us that it was. As in Underworld, the ability to use the form well was evident, but form does not make a great film or novel.So, needless to say, I was rooting for deaths all round when TEP approached its end, as I felt that I might then have gotten some value for my money. Though this will make some people scream at me, I must lump TEP in with the group of Titanic, Braveheart, Elizabeth, and all such pseudo-epics which attempt to overwhelm you with their passion, but really turn out to be banal and pompous, too aware of their own striving for grandeur.",7,9,16,24 January 1999
The Killing Fields," poignant
","I watched this movie with my father shortly after it came out on video, so I would have been only 9 or 10 at the time. I did not see it again until this year, but I could still remember the scene of a lone man stumbling across a field strewn with the skeletons of his countrymen. Watching it again was both a moving and a worthwhile experience.There are so many scenes which will, as the movie case says, haunt the viewer long after watching. The scene already mentioned, Waterston and Ngor wandering through the remains of the homes of Cambodian civilians destroyed by American bombs, a little girl, her hands over her ears, crying and screaming, surrounded by explosions and gunfire.The acting performances are top notch all round, particularly, of course, by Dr. Ngor. The team of Joffe and Menges is superb, as they also are in The Mission. Both films are in my video library.As an aside, whatever happened to Joffe? Super Mario Brothers? The Scarlet Letter? The Mission and The Killing Fields are such rich, well-crafted films. It's a shame that actors and directors are pulled towards Hollywood. Artistic integrity is priceless. Perhaps that's why it's given away by so many.",8,10,11,3 March 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," mind gum
","Well, I wasn't going to comment on this film, but I find that I have to. Comparing it to Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur is like saying that the Batman cartoonists can use chiaroscuro as well as Rembrandt did. I mean, I can see Arnie doing a cameo in a Kenneth Branagh film in the near future, can't you? He has so much heart, and does a great job of expressing the universal human spirit.This is a film that I loved when I was in high school. I am no longer in high school. I no longer love the film. It is a congeries of major elements in the American action film formula: lots of 'cool' one-liners, impressive special effects, and lots of explosions and chase scenes. At least when the film sticks to these it's entertaining in that ripping legs off of spiders sort of manner. But when it strays into the arena of philosophical rumination it's just downright sad.One has to be embarrassed for Mr. Cameron that he thinks this should be taken seriously, particularly the facile conclusion at the movie's end. If I want deep thoughts I'll watch something by Bergman or Tarkovsky. Cameron's like a French neo-classicist with some technical skills who's straining himself trying to produce something profound and winds up making a picture that has a proficient surface but no soul.",Null,5,7,10 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," amazing battle scenes, subpar story
","I went to see Saving Private Ryan twice in the theatre. I was very impressed the first time I saw it, and the battle scenes were so haunting that I felt it would be worthwhile going again. While I again enjoyed them, they obviously did not have the same impact as when seen for the first time and this caused me to give greater attention to the remainder of the film. It didn't hold up well.I feel it would have been best for Spielberg to have begun this film right off in the boat. No advance warning, no sentimentality. It would have been perhaps the most amazing first scene in cinematic history. But he had to overdo it. The first graveyard scene can be accepted, though it is undesirable. But the second was insulting, not just to me, but to the film itself and the message it had attempted to convey. He can understate well, as the scene in which Mrs. Ryan is told of the fate of her sons proves.(The rule which is so often broken by film makers today is don't tell, show. But they are so used to talking down to the audience that it is seen as desirable and normal. I see it as manipulative and condescending).It also seemed as if I could actually see the seams in the movie, the transition from one scene to the next. It was obvious that it was _written_. Yes, of course, all screenplays are written. But a truly good film can draw you in to the point where it IS reality. SPR did not do that for me. I'm sure there has already been sufficient comment on the stereotypicality of the characters. And of course the scene in which there is an argument over whether or not to take the child along with them.There is a sense in which films like this are protected from artistic judgment because it is felt that the message they are conveying is so important. I believe this is part of the reason it has received as much praise as it has. While the battle scenes and cinematography are truly magnificent, those things alone are not enough for a film to be considered the greatest film of all time, nor even the greatest war film of all time.",Null,4,6,2 March 1999
Total Recall," why must action movies require a mindcheck at the door?
","I saw Total Recall while I was in high school and since a friend of mine owns it and was talking about it the other day I thought I'd check it out again. I love Dick's novels and for that reason alone thought this would be worth watching. So sadly wrong. It was evident that the original idea was a good one, but a whole lot of garbage had been tacked on to make this into a Hollywood scifi bomb.I do not understand why some fans of science fiction and action movies think it necessary to have their intelligence insulted in order for a film to be enjoyable. Action and intelligence, sorry to say, are not mutually exclusive. The plot was by no means as complex as I remember it being, and Mars seemed even more contrived than in my first viewing.Very simple plot points could have been corrected to make Total Recall a bit more respectable. The most glaring: why is that the vague 'aliens' who built the reactor made the indentation in the panel which starts it up in the shape of a human hand? Puhleaze.",7,21,40,1 February 1999
Titanic," the last straw
","This film and the adoration it has received from viewers and reviewers alike is one of the dominant reasons why I have decided not to attend any American made films this year. My reasons are too numerous and strongly felt to be reduced to 1,000 words. I think that this picture itself can take the place of my 1,000 words of disgust with James Cameron and the American film industry.",7,12,23,19 January 1999
The Untouchables," could have, should have....
","This one isn't holding up all that well in my books. There are some undoubtedly fantastic scenes and Oscar-worthy performances. But the overall quality is spotty.Connery's performance remains one of my all-time favorites. His first meeting with Ness is very enjoyable. His death scene never fails to move me every single time I watch it. Great musical score as well.DeNiro's Capone is too one-dimensional (no fault of his), Martin-Smith's is entirely cartoonish. Garcia is good, as is Costner, the earnestness which always characterizes his performances finding a perfect match in the character of Ness.The bridge scene is so bad that it almost ruins the whole film. Connery manages to provide some saving grace with his interrogation tactics and opposition to running.It seems as if this film is composed of nothing but caricatures, from the photographer to the police trainee, but the performances are so good and there are so many strong scenes that they somehow balance out the crude (read banal) writing. A friend of mine saw an interview with Mamet in which he said that the best stuff was actually edited out of the final product. Ya gotta hate studios. The Untouchables really could have been much better than it already is.",Null,5,9,2 March 1999
The Deer Hunter," an amateur's masterpiece
","I'm a big DeNiro fan and since The Deer Hunter is a Best Picture winner as well as a DeNiro flick, I thought I'd enjoy it. I did, sort of. It definitely could have been better.In particular, the infamous wedding scene. I have no problem with long scenes: I'm a Tarkovsky fan. But they must have a point, either character development, or else setting a mood. As I see it, the wedding scene did neither. It could have been cut much shorter without losing any of its effect, and that time could have been used to give greater insight into the life of the town and the relationships between Walken, DeNiro, Streep et al.So the wedding finally ends, and almost instantly we're plunged into Vietnam and into 'the scene.' I didn't clock it, but I would bet that the wedding lasted almost as long or longer than their entire actual war experience. What was Cimino thinking? He was obviously striving for some sort of jarring contrast, but it didn't work at all. It just seemed sloppy to me. It was like a B-grade Coppola ripoff followed by something from an entirely different film, like Cimino had been watching TV and changed channels while taping. I understand that that was the point. It just wasn't done well.Then the rest of the film is based on the trauma of Vietnam and how this affected the characters. That's fine, but it's built on just one scene. It's a tribute to 'the scene' that this works at all. It is very poor writing and editing though in my opinion.The remainder of the film is enjoyable, though ponderous at times, particularly the hunting scene. I did appreciate the treatment of DeNiro coming home. Excellent understatement. Just showing him having conversations with his friends, asking how they're doing, and having them say Oh same as always was fantastic. It wasn't sententious or melodramatic. Kudos on that.The Deer Hunter seems like a half-finished sculpture. There are beautifully chiselled sections broken up by large chunks of untouched rock. The effect is very uneven. I guess the best way to sum it up is inconsistently poignant.While The Deer Hunter is a solid film, it's not the best Vietnam movie, as it can't compare to the inexorable emotional intensity of Apocalypse Now, nor am I certain it was even the best movie of its year.",Null,9,17,16 March 1999
The Matrix," at last, something I can recommend
","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the 'white room,' the baby harvester, the training scene with the 'red woman,' the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say 'they're turning humans into this' and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.I feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film.",Null,5,7,2 April 1999
