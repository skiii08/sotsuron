The Blair Witch Project," worst ending ever
",Starting of this movie was so scary that I was getting excited to see that witch.I'm giving 4 just because of the suspense they created at first .But worst ending and acting ever. way too much screaming .Those were too annoying . Expected a lot. Or expected a typical movie may be. But didn't like the ending . It could have been something more scary.,4,1,4,12 August 2018
