The Benchwarmers," Inappropriate Homosexual Insunations
","I enjoyed the movie as far as the plot and humor are concerned. But it ends right there. There were way too many inappropriate homosexual insinuations as well as degrading male relationships contained within the movie that it totally spoiled it. I walked away feeling totally frustrated with the direction this film took; and instead of feeling the uplifting, hopeful spirit I am sure was intended in the movie, was left wondering 'WHY?' and very disappointed overall. This is a movie I would not want to purchase or ever see again. As well, I would strongly warn against children of any age viewing this movie as the male characters are so grossly and inappropriately distorted.",4,3,9,7 April 2006
