Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Distinctly lacking in mystery
","Guy Ritchie's sequel to the surprisingly fabulous Sherlock Holmes is an enjoyable romp concocted from many superficially similar elements to the first movie, but at the same time fundamentally less satisfying as a piece of storytelling or as a homage to Arthur Conan Doyle's detectives. At heart seems to be a recurrent weakness in Ritchie's approach to directing, which is to return to the scene of a successfully committed crime and try to up the ante. After his initial success with 'Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch' Ritchie drove his career into a cul-de-sac with ever more convoluted reworking of the British gangster movie. His Sherlock Holmes was a new departure, whilst retaining his trademark stylised hyperviolence and successfully deploying his flair for popvideo like visuals to the backdrop of Victorian London. The visuals and the violence are intact, even improved on with a bigger budget and the confidence of the original global hit in the bank, and Robert Downey Junior is still hilarious and mesmerising with his Depp-like hypercamp re-interpretation of great detective. What's lacking is the decent storyline. While the original film employed mysticism and some real plot puzzlers which were untangled wonderfully in the denouement, there is not that much mystery to the sequel. Yes, there is lots of confusion as to what there is going on in the opening reels, but nothing really intriguing to ponder before the action kicks in. From that point there is little time for the plot to expand into the space between the setpieces, gags and Downey Jr and Law's homoerotic banter. That itself is an example of what was delicious and slightly daring in the original feeling a bit treadworn already in only the first sequel, along with the pre-narrated slow motion fight scenes. The only genuinely new factor in play is the character of Moriarty pitched perfectly by Jared Harris who is understated, yet convincingly menacing. If someone can come up with a gripping yarn, a third outing with the talents of the director and stars now firmly established in character would be welcomed, but if its only further spills and thrills we can look forward to, Ritchie might be better to quit while he's still ahead.",7,0,0,2 January 2013
