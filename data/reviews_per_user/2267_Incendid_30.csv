The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Part One Syndrome Strikes Again!
","When I went to the cinema to see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 I was expecting to see a film close to The Deathly Hallows Part 1, and that is exactly what was delivered. I am convinced that Mockingjay part 1 almost takes the plot structure from Deathly Hallows part 1 and recycles it, just with Mockingjay's story. Here is my evidence, both films start with the lead character struggling with a major change to their story that happened at the end of the previous film, both focus on a sub-plot in the overall story arc, both feature limited fight sequences, both feature one of the main character's friends being away from the story and both end with a cliffhanger. Now, do not be confused and think that I am saying that Mockingjay and Deathly Hallows are bad films, no I think both films were enjoyable. What I am saying though is that both films were created for one reason, and that was for the money, now you could say that both films were needed however I would respond by saying they could be combined with part two. Part one's are just sub plots that have been extended out to be longer, so the companies who are behind the franchises can rake in some extra cash. Now Mockinjay Part 1 is a good film, the acting was fine, the character development was average, I don't think I would consider Katniss to be a true hero yet. I liked the secondary characters such as President Coin and Finnich, however I am disappointed we didn't get to see some action with Finnich and his trident, note to Part 2, use Finnich and his trident otherwise I will be disappointed. The writing was fine, it really isn't worth talking about. I enjoyed looking at the sets, the costumes were cool, however I do feel the story did stray a little when they began to focus on Katniss's fashion, it just took me out of the film and was one of the reasons i don't truly see Katniss as a hero yet. Now finally, the directing, the tone of the film I felt wasn't as dark as Catching Fire, the pacing of the film did wobble from time to time but one thing did return that annoyed me, the shaky cam, it only appeared for the action sequences, but it was still annoying and it took me out of the film, i don't know why it was brought back, but it was a bad move none the less. Overall, Mockingjay Part 1 is an enjoyable film, that any fan will enjoy going to watch, however it does stumble into the shadow of Catching Fire. Therefore Mockingjay Part 1 receives a 6/10.",6,14,26,5 December 2014
Iron Man 3," Satisfying us between Avenger movies
","Ciaran: I found this movie very disappointing and very over-rated. For these reasons- one, it created secondary plots that were never tied up or even left open for say another movie, the CGI in this film is up to date. Another thing that makes this movie disappointing is the lack of seeing Tony Stark as Iron Man, instead we saw him as a anxiety suffering detached mechanic. I will give the film credit for the first half as it followed a good story and built on and up the characters. The film also managed to update Iron Man's arch-nemesis The Mandarin. In Iron Man 3 they made him a somewhat threatening terrorist. But after the twist of finding out that the great villain The Mandarin was just an actor and Killian, a researcher of bio-something is actually the mastermind. All in short terms i found this movie to be okay for the first half, but after the twist i felt that the movie took a turn for the worst. 6/10Jacob: No movie is flawless. There are plot holes in lots of famous movies but the thing to consider is how entertaining the movie is (strictly from the entertainment factor) and consider the problems after the viewing. Iron Man 3 is an entertaining movie for the most part. The problems are not ones that you have to dig deep to find but they are very clear and appear very commonly in the last half of the film. The beginning is brilliant with setting the tone, characters and subplots. The subplots are actually dropped or changed (for the worse)in the later half of the film. Tony Stark's anxiety attacks are completely forgotten and not mentioned again. Tony gets rid of his arc heart contraption that you would think he would of gotten rid of in the first place. A Middle-Eastern terrorist who is set up to be mysterious and one of Tony's biggest threats. That terrorist turns out to be a pathetic actor and the real mastermind is Guy Pearce's character who basically has some sort of weird pathetic grudge against Tony. This is disappointing because this terrorist is built up so much and replaced with a shirtless, womanizing weirdo with fire powers. This isn't a clever twist and his it's eye-rolling moments. The Dark Knight Rises sort of worked with it's twist because it is unexpected and Bane is not just a fraud. Pearce's character is set up as one of the villains in the beginning of the film so him taking the antagonist's role wasn't that hard to predict. The fact that he used a false antagonist symbol to distract the people was a clever idea but the flip-side of that was not all that satisfying. There is another problem that is brought up: it may be a little too predictable. However, the action and special effects are great, the humour is great, the chemistry that Tony has with Pepper, his guard and a little kid is fun to watch. Overall, it's not terrible but really fun.",6,2,5,4 October 2013
In Bruges," A dark comedy worth watching
","Before i sat down to watch this movie i expected it to be okay, but i was quite wrong, In Bruges is a well constructed film, with great comedy, dark crime and good drama. Starting off with the story, i really like it when a movie tells the prologue throughout the movie giving you more clues and never telling you exactly what happened. The structure was fine and the whole movie was rushed or stretched, the writer managed to blend the action and drama together to create a film just right in length and tone. Onto characters, throughout the 1st and 2nd act of the movie we see the bond between our two main characters build and by the third we see them fallout and a situation follows, that i won't spoil. Onto directing, the scenes where we just got to look at Bruges was just perfect, every angle just matched up with the scene, i really felt the connection to the movie, In Bruges deserves praise for its efforts. It may not be the perfect movie but it certainly a movie worth watching. It receives an 8/10.",7,0,3,29 June 2014
The Big Lebowski," Witty, Hilarious and one of my favourites!
","This film was absolutely hilarious, it had witty remarks and i can say with confidence that i love this movie! To start this movie takes a simple complication and just keeps on piling on complication after complication that eventually we would suspect the story would become very complicated and hard to follow, but in The Big Lebowski, the main characters don't seem to be affected by all these situations and complications, some would say this is bad story-telling, but the fact that the main characters acknowledge the difficulties and try to solve them as best they can, and being people who are just going where the wind takes them in life you would think that the whole story would end up the same way even if they weren't there but no it is the exact opposite. Anyway, onto my verdict of the story, coming from the minds of the Coen brothers they managed to create a dark, witty and hilarious story with twists and bumps causing the story to become so detailed yet with a real tone, not a film-real tone a real down to earth tone, i still can't comprehend how they managed to do it. This story will keep you entertained and thinking for weeks, therefore the story gets a pass from me. Onto direction, i thoroughly enjoy the Coen brothers style and in The Big Lebowski it really worked, giving us the exact angle we needed, and entertaining us with beautiful shots with dialogue that will not soon be forgotten. There isn't much else to say other than i am really looking forward to the next Coen brothers film and you should too, so as my final rating i am giving The Big Lebowski a 9/10.",9,0,2,20 June 2014
The Maze Runner," Another forgettable and quite vexing adaptation.
","Jacob's Review: I did not have high hopes or any real sense of anticipation, in fact I saw this movie on a spontaneous whim. The premise of this movie is similar to a lot of common young adult novels were teenagers are thrown into a perilous situation, need to work their way out, the special or reluctant hero and being observed and monitored by an oppressive of suspicious cooperation or government. Such premises have been tackled in films and their novel counterparts such as The Hunger Games and Divergent. This movie does have unbelievable and contrived reasons for its central Maze setting which is reluctantly passable at first but becomes more frustrating as the film explains itself. There are good performances and you do fear for our heroes in some very well executed maze chase sequences. Essentially an amnesia ridden teenager is delivered monthly to the maze via an underground elevator and the characters have to survive with no idea about their surroundings and restricted monthly resources. Interesting take on the young adult survivalist premise but as stated it really makes little to no sense. There are cyborg creatures that are treated with much fear and dread (hence their name grievers) but off course they are only great at diminishing the expendables and are clumsy around our heroes. The end has a severe case sequel bait and it only makes the ending more and more infuriating. See it if you want to, but you won't get anything terrific. 5/10",5,1,3,2 October 2014
The Babadook," A Truly Terrifying Film.
","The Babadook is a terrifying psychological thriller with a brilliant blend of drama and horror that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Babadook explores heavy themes and their psychological effect on an individual. The Babadook has been brilliantly written, with excellent dialogue that puts the audience into the story and an interesting story that keeps the audience interested. The directing was great and managed to capture the concept of horror and provide a visual experience that terrified me. Every time the Babadook was mentioned, I was scared, because the character had been designed to be so terrifying and realistic that you believe the creature actually existed. However to actually sell something to the audience is a difficult process, and with great writing, clever directing and brilliant performances the process becomes much more achievable. Essie Davis delivered an award worthy performance, throughout the film she goes through an array of emotions, that require strong acting to complete. To summarise, The Babadook is the best horror film i have seen in years, with great acting, directing and superb writing from Jennifer Kent, The Babadook receives a 9/10.",9,6,14,17 December 2014
Creed," WARNING: Stallone does not yell anybody's name in this film.
","Creed is a spin-off of the Rocky series and follows Apollo Creed's son, Adonis as he seeks a boxing mentor. The film is directed and written by Ryan Coogler (The script was also co-written by Aaron Corvington), and stars Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. I think in ten years, most people will remember the performances in Creed. Michael B. Jordan is a strong lead and brings a determined energy to the underdog role. This is complemented by a reluctant Sylvester Stallone, who gives one of his best performances in years and gives candid and touching moments in different scenes during the film.The star of the film though has to be the fight scenes, which are beautifully shot by Marysee Alberti, who decided to use flowing long wide shots complemented by minimal cuts - except for the climax. Outside of the fight scenes the whole film is rich in great shots and there is one in particular towards the end of the film, which holds a lot of energy, and encapsulates everything the film wanted to show and I feel we will be talking about this scene for a while.By the way the score by Ludwig Goransson is pretty good, especially during the fight at the climax.Now the story, it is good, however it begins to wobble slightly during the second half of the film and by no means is it subtle, which is proved by the characters who just state what they mean, fortunately Jordan and Stallone manage to work around it. I felt the romantic sub-plot came out of nowhere. Other than those minor problems I found the film to be high entertaining, during the fights the tension and the stakes are felt and the father-son like relationship between Balboa and Creed is played out nicely however it is not too subtle.Now the sound editing is good for the most part, however in some scenes when Stallone is shouting- it sounds as if he is sitting inside of my ear with a megaphone. Also some of the make-up is distracting- I won't say any more.To conclude, I recommend you go and watch Creed, it is a very engaging film with some exciting moments. I know I will be buying it on blu- ray for the score and the beautiful cinematography. Creed has a place in my top five films of this year, therefore i am going to give Creed an 8/10 or a B+.",8,2,6,29 November 2015
Home Alone," Perhaps the best live-action kids film out there.
","Home Alone, is known worldwide, we all know the story and we all know at least one line from the movie, and it was only lately that i decided it deserved to be re watched, and so i did and i found that the film was great but it did have some errors which i will discuss in this review. Anyway to start this short review, lets have a look at the story, we have Kevin McCallister, the child of (even though they never say) rich couple who are going on a vacation to Paris, in the madness of trying to get out of the house, the leave Kevin behind. Then we have some burglars who want to rob the place, and Kevin must defend his house. Now, i found this to be believable but some of the things that happen throughout the story are strange, such as (i think) we sometimes see the world as Kevin sees it such as the Oven(?) downstairs and Old Man Marley at the grocery store. These were just some unusual points in the movie, which is nor a good or bad thing. You could say the whole movie is about growing up and becoming more selfless rather than being selfish, and this is a good message to tell, it also seems to make an entertaining movie. Onto directing, what can i say Chris Columbus is a good director when it comes to kids films, he is definitely a safe choice. Now i think i will mention a few mistakes in the movie i noticed such as- Buzz could not have seen Old Man Marley from where he was standing, as the curtains were half closed and Old Man Marley was on the far right, not in the middle of the window, therefore Buzz could never had seen him. Also one other thing, was the church scene sort of like in Kevin's mind showing Old Man Marley coming from the dark, scary side over to Kevin's light, nice side, just what i saw in the lighting. Anyway to sum up the film i personally think it is one of the best kids films out there and is a must watch for everybody. Home Alone gets a 7/10.",7,0,0,25 July 2014
L.A. Confidential," Seductive.
","To Start, L.A. Confidential is a story about corruption, police brutality, trust and masculinity. The film follows three policemen who have different ways of solving cases. The first is Bud White played by Russell Crowe, who uses violence, the second is Ed Exley played by Guy Pearce who is diplomatic and runs to the point and thirdly we have Jack Vincennes played by Kevin Spacey, who is sleazy and likes to be in the spotlight. All three deliver great performances, however Vincennes character does begin to fade from the film during the second half. However Exley and Whitey both have completed character arcs and are well developed. After the fallout of an event at the start of the film, we can see the different paths Exley and White have taken however both seem to be on a collision course with each other, and as one of them gains a new piece of information, the other will go one step further. White's character is quite interesting, he has respect for women and protects them at all costs, not matter the consequences. To balance this, he is quite violent towards men, making his judgement somewhat clouded, Exley on the other hand believes in one thing and that is Justice, he is also the complete opposite to White, he uses his words before he uses his hands.The story is slow, but for a film just over two hours long, being slow is fine. The tone is well dark, and it provides irony, as L.A. in 1950's at least was advertised as the city where dreams come true and in L.A. Confidential we see the dark truth. For the most part the script is logical and lateral, however there are a few minor, and they really are minor, hiccups. For example,at a plot point in the film, a character gives another character an essential clue, however I found it silly that the former character who had been so careful up until this point would give away such an essential clue. Other than that the other problems are truly minor. Onto direction, Curtis Hanson manages to wrangle three worlds within one film, and to keep them separate would have been no easy task, and actually sustaining them would have been quite difficult indeed. The sets looked fantastic, they were all quite engrossing, which is always good. The costumes perfectly fit in with the time period and each character's costume was recognisable, and unlike Jurassic Park, the character's costumes were not Care-beared or in other words each character had a different coloured shirt. The cinematography was great and worked with the limitations of the film. Although the score was nominated for an Oscar, it just didn't fit for me.In conclusion, L.A. Confidential is a great film and definitely anybody who is a fan of crime dramas or mystery and detective films should watch. My rating: 9/10.",9,1,2,29 May 2015
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Another Kubrick Masterpiece!
","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb revolves around the theme of war. The film presents the theme of war with sharp comedy coming from interesting and well-developed characters, all this provides for an entertaining experience in one of Kubrick's masterpieces.Dr. Strangelove came out just after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the film presents the fear of MAD and just how easy it is for everything to fall apart. However the film is more about the way war is handled, we see those who are afraid and make decisions they think are right and suit their morals, however those decisions have greater ramifications for others. We see soldiers following orders, and how realistically the soldier is not the one who should be held to blame, but rather those who deliver the orders in the first place. And finally we see how the leaders of war handle war, Kubrick displays this in the war room, where he shows the audience that the leaders are not exactly capable of handling the situation at hand. Overall though, Kubrick displays the childish nature of war and how the actions of others lead to a much larger consequences and how it affects the innocent bystanders. On the other hand Kubrick shows the audience the reality of war and it's volatile nature. And this is what makes Dr. Strangelove so successful, it shows the two sides of war using sharp comedy along with interesting characters and a plot that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Peter Sellers and George C. Scott delivered superb performances, with Sellers playing three characters in the movie, George C. Scott is perfect in the film and everyone else was great as well. The directing from Kubrick is amazing and he writing is excellent. Dr. Strangelove is a superb comedy classic everyone should watch. 10/10.",9,2,4,7 December 2014
Alien," A truly original survival horror film.
","Jacob's Review: Alien is the first entry to the Alien franchise and so far it is one of the best. The surprising element to me in this film was its pacing. Being raised in an era of film that is so ADD ridden and impatient could influence my thinking ability when it comes to analyzing film but it was so refreshing to see a movie that builds such an eerie and desolate atmosphere. The movie is patient and rather builds tension and character before SNAP and something horrific happens. This is what may dispirit a lot of viewers which is why many people prefer Aliens (1986) to the topic film. It works for me. The characters act like real people and the design, metamorphosis and behaviour of the alien creature is incredibly haunting but left open to interpretation due to the mystery that shrouds the creature (or later known as xenomorph) in its latter stage. If you haven't seen it then I recommend this truly unique gem to those with an attention span. 9/10",9,2,4,11 July 2014
Interstellar," Nolan's 2001: A Space Odyssey.
","2001: A Space Odyssey revolutionised the way sci-fi films are made and the way audiences view them. So naturally over the last 46 years, many film makers have tried to recreate the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, however in my opinion I do not believe any film maker has achieved the magic that Kubrick created back in 1968. However when I heard that Christopher Nolan would be creating Interstellar, a new and original film about space and humanity, it became clear that Interstellar would be paying homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey throughout the whole film. However i am not saying that Interstellar is just a direct homage, it is in it's own, an original film that shows themes that 2001: A Space Odyssey did not. The theme of love is a key element in the story, the theme of survival is also a key element in the story, both these themes distinguish Interstellar from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Interstellar is a great film about humanity, survival, love, exploring the unknown and the human experience, all these themes are given the respect they deserve and provide the audience with a clever and complex plot that provides for great cinema. Unfortunately, some of the magic of the film is lost through Nolan's exposition where he spoon-feeds the audience everything they need to know and more. This defeats the mystery and edge the film should have, instead we are given so much information that the story actually begins to drag.On the other hand, Interstellar makes up for this by providing the audience with a visual experience worth watching on the big screen in its highest quality. The blend of visual and practical effects provides the audience with a space that looks believable and awe- inspiring. Nolan presents his visual masterpiece in such a professional and interesting way that the audience is kept entertained with the visuals even if the story begins to drag.The acting in Interstellar was great. Anne Hathaway provided a great performance along with Michael Caine, Matt Damon and John Lithgow, but the real magic of the film came from the father-daughter relationship between Matthew McConaughey's character Cooper and Mackenzie Foy's character Murph, their relationship was what kept me and invested in the film, i wanted to see if they would ever see each other ever again, i wanted the two to come back together. Their relationship is what drove the movie and allowed the audience to connect to the characters in Interstellar's complex plot.To sum up, Interstellar is a good film that could have been great with a little bit of tweaking, not Nolan's greatest film but without a doubt one of his greatest visual achievements that everyone should definitely go and watch on the big screen to enjoy the cinematic experience that is Interstellar. Therefore Interstellar is receiving a 7/10.",7,1,3,5 December 2014
Léon: The Professional," Milk.
","I have been dying to buy Leon for years now and when i saw it on the top shelf at my local music store (why it was there i don't know) i bought it straight away, went home and watched it and it was awesome. The directing was as smooth as a circle, the writing inventive, the action was limited but awesome when it was there, the acting holds up mostly and then there is the greatest villain of them all, Gary Oldman. Starting with the acting, Jean Reno aced his performance and really did portray the 'cleaner' profession, i really do wish all films based around hit-men could be like this, i really do. The writing, it sustained a brisk pace throughout the movie and plotted twists and turns in different places creating this fantastic film. But there is one character who i find unusually disturbing and this was Matilda played by Natalie Portman, Matilda was weird, disturbing and a little bit looney, but on the other hand she is still a innocent kid who loves to copycat and play games, yet she acts like an adult to lure Leon into her trap where who knows what would have happened. Matilda disturbed me yet showed me the innocence of childhood and that is exactly what a charterer like her should do, divide your opinion and question their every move. Then there is Gary Oldman, and he honestly was more disturbing, you could see the insanity in his eyes, yet he could be disturbingly calm or the complete opposite and we never actually get to know his character which i love to see, every film needs a character like this, i think it just keeps the audience on the edge of their seat just connecting the dots. To conclude i feel as if Leon has made it into my top 10 favourite films of all time so i award it with a 9/10.",7,2,4,16 May 2014
Oblivion," An Intelligent Sci/fi Movie
","Ciaran's Review: Initially i did not like Oblivion for one reason- Tom Cruise. But after watching the movie for a second time and thinking about the film's story, i realised i really enjoyed the movie. The CGI in Oblivion is beautiful, the story intelligent and the acting is great. I enjoyed the twists and turns, i did not see the twist in the middle of the movie coming, but it was only obvious the second time watching the movie. Oblivion in my opinion was more enjoyable to watch than Elysium, although i enjoyed Elysium's villain more. Overall i think Oblivion is enjoyable but needs to be watched twice- at some points i felt the movie could drag on and i personally can't stand 'fading to black transitions'. Oblivion 8/10",6,0,0,9 January 2014
Man of Steel," Excessive and shallow
","Ciaran: Man of Steel has caused many people to be divided on whether or not the film is good or bad. In my opinion Man of Steel is a good superhero film. Man of Steel does what it needs to do to show Superman is a hero. The story flows nicely with some plot holes, however this is to be expected from any film, as no film is perfect. The character development for Superman was fine, the amount of action in the film was fine, and I give credit to the crew for displaying realistic destruction. I believe that the reason most people complain about Man of Steel is because of how different Man of Steel's tone is compared to the 1978 Superman. To sum up, Man of Steel is not a bad film it is just misunderstood due to the tone of the film. My final rating: 7/10.Jacob: Upon second viewing I liked the movie less and less. My problems are not only that this is dark and excessive in the destruction factor. My problem is the pacing and attempt at developing characters. Henry Cavill was a sympathetic and likable superman, Amy Adams was hit and miss, Michael Shannon was awesome as Zod but the rest were pretty bland and even the leading performances could sometimes come across as bland. There are repetitive scenes that constantly remind the audience that he is the hero that is destined to save everyone and to go as far as to symbolically resemble him as Jesus in the most ham-fisted and obvious way. I understand the Batman Begins like structure of the movie but the characters come off as bland and the repetition could become boring and drags the movie. Other than some impressive visuals, the odd good performance, it tries to be emotional but subsequently fails, not a complete failure but just a minor failure. 5/10",6,2,5,7 September 2013
The Lego Movie," Everything is awesome.
","I watched this film over a month ago and the main theme song is still repeating itself through my head, but i remember this film so well and whenever i hear that song it reminds me of how awesome of a film the Lego Movie was. The jokes are aimed at kids, but some of them especially the subtle ones were hilarious. The writing suited the film and i loved how the film didn't force its serious message, you could argue the message was pointless but i found it gave the film some extra substance. What really stood out was the acting, i felt that all the correct actors had been chosen except for maybe one and that would be Will Ferrell. Now i have never been a big Will Ferrell fan, the only films i like with him in it are Zoolander and the first Anchorman film. And i almost walked out of the cinema because of him i really didn't think he was funny, there was maybe one joke that i chuckled at and it really was something silly. All in all, i felt the movie was awesome and i hope will be remembered and cherished for years to come. 8/10",8,1,6,16 May 2014
Non-Stop," Do it again except this time in a submarine.
","Ciaran: When i saw the Non-Stop trailer a week ago, i didn't have overly high expectations for this movie. When i watched the movie, i had a mixed opinion. So the movie begins at an airport, where we see Bill Marks, an alcoholic air Marshall heading to London. Once on the plane, he receives messages about a threat on the plane, the man messaging Bill explains he will kill one person on the plane every 20 minutes, we see Bill interrogate people one by one, eventually only 3 people are killed. This was the story i wanted to see and it was done nicely, but then a bomb was put on the plane- this decision in my opinion ruined the whole movie. Although just after Bill finds the bomb, he says that he thinks that he was never actually meant to find the bomb- i believe this was the original idea the script writers had, that the bomb would just go off- but that probably wouldn't have worked with the general audience. But one of my biggest questions is 'where did the budget go?', i mean the only set they had to construct was probably the inside of the plane and the only other place we see is the airport, so where did the budget go?, i can tell you that it didn't go to the special effects team. Talking about the special effects- i have to say they looked good at the start of the film, but then when we eventually get to the end it looks as if the team slipped a little. Overall i felt Non-Stop was okay, but sadly we have seen this type of movie before, as an action movie it was good to watch, as a mystery i found it a bit too predictable and as thriller it wasn't that good, so i feel my final verdict can only be a 6/10.",6,0,2,1 March 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Just as good as the first one.
","After watching Maleficent i was really hoping this movie would defy my expectations which were that the sequel to the 2010 original would be a pile of money-making junk, but i was wrong. I have to say, there is something about the HTTYD series, it seems as if everyone who was working on it put all the effort they could into creating an animated kids film like no other, yes the story structure is quite familiar, but the twists and turns the story undertakes is what makes the franchise unique, that and the amazing visuals, because of this HTTYD was a huge success and now i am here to talk about the sequel. The visuals were amazing in this movie, no they were more than amazing, the visuals in this movie took 3d animation to the next level, some scenes i just forgot about what was happening and watched the scenery and there were a few scenes where the audience is supposed to just soak up the environment, these animators have created. There is one problem with the story, it felt as if the writers had just adapted the story to be slightly different than the first one, except this time we had a lot more character development, actually i think that this was what the movie was all about developing the characters for the 3rd film, overall the story was believable and kept me interested but perhaps not hooked. Finally the characters, yeah the villain was interesting, didn't really feel as if he was a bad guy, i felt he was more a misled man who really didn't understand what he was doing- and that was exactly how the movie played him, he was a misled character who Hiccup tried to convince to change their ways and be one with the dragon, and i suppose the whole franchise you could say has the message of 'be one with nature, and respect the creatures who live with us', and now this is good message to tell the younger generations, and the franchise does it so well. My final verdict is that HTTYD2 is a fun family film and i highly recommend you go see it. 8/10",8,2,6,13 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," One of the best films of the year!
","I wish i went and saw The Grand Budapest Hotel in cinemas, and if it wasn't for Godzilla i would have, but i didn't so when i heard The Grand Budapest Hotel was available at my local JB-HI-FI, i ran down and bought a copy and well now i am going to tell you what i thought about one of the best films of the year.Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is a film about war, love, commitment, murder, manipulation,image and friendship. Wes Anderson manages to balance these heavy themes so neither one out weighs the other and makes sure that the themes are played out with subtly but presented directly to the audience. War is one themes that is clearly present in the film, but is played so well, that half the time you forget it is even making an impact on the film itself. The theme of love and manipulation define Ralph Fiennes' character M. Gustave as throughout the film he searches for something without even knowing it. Love is also played out excellently in the relationship between Zero and Agatha, who have superb chemistry. Commitment is another themes that comes up and is discussed in a few scenes between Zero and M. Gustave. Image and how people want to be seen comes up in the film, with M. Gustave who is obsessed with his image. But the theme of friendship is perhaps the most important, with the relationship between M. Gustave and Zero and the acts of friendship and commitment to one another, it shows friendship as a bond that cannot be broken.The writing was fantastic, with a story is original, creative, fun and intriguing, it will keep the audience interested from start to finish, the dialogue is perfect, Wes Anderson's directing style never gets old and provides a playful and authentic visual experience for the audience. The sets were amazing, the costumes brilliant and the make-up fantastic, they managed to make Tilda Swinton unrecognisable. The acting was superb all around, with a award worthy performance from Ralph Fiennes, and great performances from Zero and Saoirse Ronan, who had excellent chemistry and presented their dialogue perfectly. To sum up, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of the year, with award worthy work all around. Wes Anderson presents a fun memorable film, that doesn't disappoint. The Grand Budapest is definitely in my top 15 favourite films of all time, therefore it receives a 9/10.",9,2,4,17 December 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Fun Summer Sci-fi film
","I was introduced two the first Planet of the Apes films when I was around 10. While I enjoyed them, they weren't anything that I wanted to view again. I got around to watching this film with no anticipation or any idea of the concept but merely a recommendation from my friends. I witnessed a film that impressed me and continues to do so. While the CGI apes are occasionally phony, I was sincerely impressed on a special effects level and a sci-fi story level. The downside however are the human characters. Franco has been given very little to work with, and the rest are a bit cartoony: the boss that is only concerned about money, an overly-aggravated neighbour and a bratty aggravated teen played by Malfoy. His father also doesn't react too concerned when he is axed off. Franco sees his pet chimp lead an army of apes into the redwoods however he isn't scared, worried or any normal reaction, in fact he seems proud that his pet ape lead an army of apes and killed innocent people. The one plot convenience that bothered me is that, Caesar, our leading ape was born with increased brain function which is hereditary due to his mother being injected with an anti-Alzheimer formula. When spending time with other apes he exposes them to this medicine which makes them smarter. After they escape they rally up some more apes from zoos who haven't been exposed. And I guess they instinctively know what they are doing and where they are going. Other than that, the best aspect is the apes who give almost human-like performances with real emotion. Go see it. 7/10",7,3,6,10 July 2014
Frozen," Best Disney Animated Film In A While
","Ciaran:Frozen, one of my favourite movies of 2013. Frozen is the Disney movie i have been waiting for and the result did not disappoint. Frozen captured my imagination as it dove into the topics of adventure,friendship, companionship and the true meaning of 'true love'. The animation in the film was perfect and the dialogue and comedy suited the animation style and the tone of the movie. Being a more mature audience member the story could become predictable at some times, although the story is not intended to capture my age group. I would have to watch the movie again but i was happy that Disney had withheld from placing adult jokes into the movie. Frozen also managed to beautifully blend music into scenes and stunned me with the outstanding animation. I loved Frozen, i don't want to see a sequel as i feel it would only ruin the first. Frozen deserves all praise and deserves every award coming its way. Frozen, fun for everybody- 8/10Bob the Film Guy: I have grown a new outlook and respect for movies targeted at children. I respond to kid's movies that could indeed affect them whether it be inappropriate content or blatant annoying stupid humour that seems to only entertain kids whilst annoying the parents or caretakers. There are movies that are entertaining for all ages even though there target demographic is children. Frozen is one of those movies. I was thrilled and amazed by this movie's desire to make the audience members laugh and show interest and sympathy for the characters and story. The CG animation is spectacular, bright, colourful and beautiful and the song sequences are memorable, powerful and catchy. It also deviates from a few of your average Disney clichés and actually pokes fun at them. There are no talking animals: the feature reindeer doesn't talk but instead the main character speaks for him by reacting to his facial expressions.That is genius. The love aspect of the movie is also made fun of. Usually a Disney romance (except for beauty and the beast) would form over a day or two but instead the main character, Anna, falls in love with a prince whom she just met and her sister and party members are shocked by this. The prince eventually is shown to be nasty and an ice-seller/mountain man turns out to be her main lover.But the romance is not the focus it is secondary to the bond between the two sisters. This movie will be pleasant especially for siblings. Not all clichés die however, a tragic parental death has to occur. Aside from that, this movies deserves all fame and fortune. Get read to kick some ice! Stay cool! Freeze well... I just had to do it. Frozen: 8/10",7,1,4,5 January 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Web-Hand...why?
","Ciaran: I really didn't know what to think of this movie it was poorly edited, the villains were cramped in and the story started out alright but then was just rushed for the latter part of the film and i predicted everything in this film. But there was some light, the acting, the only good part of the movie, Garfield suited Spider-Man and played Parker well, Emma Stone was great but Paul Giamatti as Rhino, the wrong decision, he was only on screen for a few minutes as rhino and he really did not suit the part i was almost laughing just at how over the top he was making the rhino look, so i feel someone else would have better suited the role of Rhino. Anyway, moving along the foreshadowing seen in one scene later in the film revealed that we may see the sinister six in the next installment of the Amazing Spider-Man series- i really do hope they go along with this. Anyway on to the negative aspects of the film- the editing was horrible the film was so jumbled it was making the editing from Dead Man Down look good. There would be an action scene and then it would flick to an out of place scene not serving any story or actually anything purposeful. And now the story- the most predictable story ever, there was no surprises- NONE, i was bored when there wasn't action and even then some action scenes were just poorly written. And now finally the extremely strange scene where Spider-Man shoots a web which has a hand at the end of it, there is some symbolism here (as he just about to save someone and it is as if he is reaching out for them, and lending his hand- stupid because Spider-Man is a superhero, and i would expect this from a superhero)but this scene is just pointless, stupid and actually a bit embarrassing and it really did ruin the movie for me. To conclude the movie had limited ups and some good moments but for the most part it was a pile of predictable junk. 6/10Jacob: I originally loved the first installment but the second viewing made it evident that it was just a cash grab on the Spiderman name. I was actually looking forward to this movie and it did improve some aspects but seldom performed anything special and is actually one big embarrassing turd. I will quickly look over the positive aspects: Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are both terrific actors and have one adorable little romance, the film is very bright and colourful and the action is often exciting. It eventually became clear that this movie's structure and editing was jumbled. I heard rumours and news about different subplots, characters and I felt apprehensive because this had the potential to turn into a cluster-bomb and my predictions were seemingly met. There is way too much information and stories that this movie is trying to tell. As a result character motivations are rushed, as well as their own story lines. Things are put aside to make room for more plots and predictable twists. Paul Giamatti was hamming it up as well as the incredibly goofy Jamie Foxx as Electro. Aunt May is a nurse and we cut to her during the final battle for some reason as well as some random airline pilots and of all the things they could have cut out , they left the most pointless plot lines in. Why is there an old clock tower in an electricity grid? How does Gwen know the grid? She is just a high school student. The big twists? Oscorp is bad! How about the stupid web hand? Harry Osborne makes a nice touch but is also rushed. This is a long, stupid and cramped movie just made so Sony can keep their rights. This movie is the result of corporate greed 4/10.",5,1,4,16 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," A hilarious comedy with spectacular action and a whole lot of heart.
","Ciaran's Review:I remember when i first saw GotG open with a nine, with positive reviews and then opening with 160 million dollars worldwide i was amazed and it was at this point that i made the decision to go watch this movie. Did i make the right decision? Yes. Guardians of the Galaxy's story line is one that is intriguing, it follows quite an ordinary structure (in terms of a bunch of outcasts come to form a powerful team), but it is what happens in this structure that is so intriguing. The film doesn't waste anytime building character, and they really nailed building characters, throughout the whole film you feel connected to the characters, which is what film is all about, feeling connected to the story and characters who experience it and GotG managed to do this so well, and that is one reason why it is one of the best films of this year. Now, when i saw that James Gunn the writer of the Scooby-Doo films was writing and directing i was worried, but when i saw the film apparently i had nothing to worry about, as the directing was smooth and enjoyable to watch, he didn't have any weird camera angles, at times you did notice the odd camera angle but for the most part you forgot who the director was, i personally think that Guardians of the Galaxy is James Gunn's best film and i think he will overtime become known for it. Onto acting, when i saw the cast for GotG, i thought it could work, and it really did work, Chris Pratt was the best fit, he had humor and he played his character well, Zoe Saldana was the only person who could play Gamora, she was fast and witty, Dave Bautista is perhaps the best wrestler to movie star to hit our screens since the rock, he aced his performance as Drax, Vin Disel's voice suited Groot, and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, i really think Cooper stole the show, when Rocket was on screen you watched him and listened to him, even when he wasn't on screen you wanted to see Rocket, i really believe he stole the show. Now there is one thing i had a problem with and that is Ronan the Accuser, as a villain his motives were quite average, and i think if he had been written to have a bit more comedy, he would have worked as a character, other than that, Lee Pace really made the character his own. Onto CGI and let me tell you, at no point in this movie did the CGI look cheap, the whole way through the CGI was convincing, so well done to GotG's effects department for pulling off these great results. Now the soundtrack in this movie i have one word for it 'awesome', every song suited the situation, it tied the whole movie together, i think if you removed the soundtrack from this movie and replaced it, i think the whole movie would just not have the same emotional feel because the soundtrack is so important in this film. To sum it all up, Guardians of the Galaxy is a hilarious comedy with spectacular action and a whole lot of heart, and that is why Guardians of the Galaxy is getting a 9/10 from me.Jacob: The trailers to this movie made it appear that it was something different and possibly more quirky than any of the other previous installments to the Marvel cinematic universe. The trailer gave me hope although I was not heavily anticipating the release. The reviews came in with overwhelming positive reaction with people already quoting the movie and a tremendous U.S box office result. With all honesty, I loved every moment of this movie, even the tired Marvel tropes. How so? The movie glorifies familiarity and the odd, outlandish characters and scenarios. The villain is a generic megalomaniac but is somewhat comedic because he is so power hungry and silly in his motivation. The McGuffin plot was to be expected and it is a generic super-powerful object but it did little to annoy me when it came to triteness. The film is incredibly self aware, funny and surprisingly engaging. The movie has a sweet centre, a real emotional core which invests you with every character. I gained a sort of outlook on this movie: this is a mixture of everything that fan-boys and fan-girls will love. It has a Star Wars, Star Trek, Avengers, Indiana Jones, Uncharted feel to it. Chris Pratt was so likable just as well as the remaining cast members. I have little more to say but 9/10. I AM GROOT!",8,1,4,8 August 2014
Everest," Flawed.
","Everest is a film that tells the story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which a climbing expedition is devastated by a severe storm. The film was directed by 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormakur and written by William Nicholson (Gladiator, Les Miserables) and Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes and Josh Brolin. To start the film is beautiful; the director of photography Salvatore Totino presented the size and scale of the environment beautifully with multiple aerial shots. Totino has a clear and linear style, which is refreshing after the summer, which with the exception of a couple of films, has been dominated by shaky-cam and extremely quick cuts.The dialogue in the film stands out, however the plot does not. The characters were underdeveloped, partially due to the lack of introduction that is given to our main characters; this combined with the slow pace of the first act causes the film to drag. However it should be noted that the film makes a point of showing the process of preparing to climb Everest. The second act is fine, not great though and is intense especially during the storm and finally the film just finishes, which really throws you out of the film. Although none of the performances in the film were award-worthy they still were acceptable and in some cases quite good. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin had the meatiest roles, and they both provided good performances. However out of the two, Jason Clarke provided the best performance. The side characters were forgettable, with the exception of Doug (John Hawkes) and Yasuko (Naoko Mori), with Doug being a postman and Yasuko finally completing the seven summits, two things which helped to distinguish them. Everyone in the film was 'care-beared', thankfully, and they had to be otherwise it would impossible to tell who you were looking at.One part of production that deserves praise in this film is the lighting department who did a superb job on presenting a clear environment; especially during the storm. A quick side note- the score of the film was forgettable. Ultimately, Everest is an intense drama thriller that has its problems, however is still beautiful to watch, I wouldn't purchase it on 3D Blu-ray, as after watching it in 3D I didn't find anything spectacular or noteworthy, however I would consider buying it on Blu-ray. Overall, I am going to give Everest a C+ or 6/10.",6,56,88,20 September 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," Visual Poetry!
","2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that is very hard to describe and also a film that says film is not just art it is high art and has true meaning and relevance in society. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film raises the bar in terms of how sci-fi films are seen, how sci- fi films can show relevance in today's society, how sci-fi films can offer deep and meaningful insight into the human experience and also provide moral lessons to an audience, 2001: A Space Odyssey also showed off it's amazing effects and clever story and score that keeps people invested in the story and wanting more. Over the years many film makers have tried to recreate the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, however I don't think that over, the past 46 years there has been a film that has come close to achieving the visual poetry that 2001: A Space Odyssey so flawlessly presented.2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique film that pushes the audience's beliefs and how we see the issues of human efficiency, technology and the unknown. Stanley Kubrick blends these themes flawlessly and executes them with his trademarks, providing the audience with a deep film that is both eerie and mesmerising. In conclusion 2001: A Space Odyssey is a timeless classic that many consider visual poetry. It is a film everyone should watch and for that reason 2001: A Space Odyssey receives a 10/10.",10,2,4,5 December 2014
Elysium," Gore, The Space station and all the accents you can get!
","Ciaran: Elysium, spaceships, gore and realistic settings. The movie started out like many other films based around space, although how they explained the back story i feel could have been done not in text but with ambient vocals. Elysium also stood out with good casting, realistic violence and stunning visual effects, although it had its flaws like the excessive violence and the pace of the movie and most of all pointless plot holes and unnecessary characters, the movie could have been mastered by keeping the slow pace and dramatic sideline stories and this would have kept the doors open for the creators to film a sequel, but this wasn't done. Instead we have mixed movie with escalates from slow to awfully quick within minutes. Overall the movie had gore galore and a rushed storyline. My Rating: 6/10Jacob's Review: To compare this movie to District 9 is like comparing Indiana Jones to Star Wars. One may be better than the other but they are completely different movies. While District 9 was an intelligent movie with perfectly executed social commentary, Elysium is a fun action movie with a social message but not as intelligently portrayed in District 9 but not too forced either. I loved the realistic portrayal of the corrupt futuristic world; not everything is pretty and flashy. The visual effects are incredible, the music is great and it is just an awesome flick. There are only a few minor problems though. While the characters are not incredibly deep or fleshed out, they are well realised and have good motivations especially the grimy villain. The problem is Jodie Foster's character and overall performance. It is just strange, odd and her character is two-dimensional. There are other nit-picky points like why did we build a giant space station that must have taken decades to produce when we could use some of resources to help humanity. These are not important as the film is a blast (to a guy's face) from start to finish. 7.5/10",5,0,2,7 September 2013
How to Train Your Dragon," One of the best animated movies of the 2000s
","Ciaran: How to train your dragon is up in the top 10 animated movies of all time for me. I just love this movie, it takes an over used storyline and paces it into a brilliant film and then mixes it with good actors, experienced directors and perhaps the greatest animation viewed in 3D of all time. From start to finish how to train your dragon shows how tradition changes and the world is ever changing, there are many messages that can be drawn out of the movie such as an environmental statement, one with animals or in the case of the movie- one with dragons. You could praise this movie so much, but what stands out for me is the constant WOW moments i experienced whilst watching this movie, the visuals and the angles just made me feel as if i was riding the dragon or fighting off the dragons, i felt immersed in the world the animators had created, and that is a very large accomplishment. Even though the plot line has been used a million times before the pacing and twist on the plot supplied to us by the directors makes How to Train your Dragon all the more enjoyable. To conclude i really would like to see more of the world of How to train your dragon, i look forward to the new sequel, but i just hope this film isn't ruin but its successor.",8,0,1,16 April 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A meticulously crafted story with stellar performances.
","Birdman is a dark comedy about Riggan Thompson, a washed up actor who puts on a play, throughout the film he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family all before the opening of the play. With a methodical story, Birdman becomes a film that is easy to follow and still talks about serious themes, such as drug addiction, control, adultery, relevance, film critics, friendship, lying, celebrities and of course superheroes. All these themes are woven flawlessly into the script that is delivered perfectly thanks to the great direction of Alejandro G. Inarritu and stellar performances from Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. Keaton was the only person who could play Riggan Thompson, the chemistry between Keaton and Stone was great, the constant banter between pretty much everyone in the cast was a great touch and the weight of the film was so effectively executed in the dialogue. Alejandro Inarritu's directing was meticulous and precise, but the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki was fantastic, the idea for the film to look like one take was an intelligent idea and it allowed the film to feel like a play, which was a nice touch and was an effective technique. Birdman talks about the negative effects of drugs, yet taking drugs is accepted by and sometimes even encouraged by society. The film dives into the role of the director and how their ego can sometimes come in the way of the production, sometimes causing damage to their work, it also talks about clashing egos between cast and crew, the manipulative ways of the director and the struggle for absolute control on what should be a collaborative project. The film comments on relevance through Riggan's ever changing struggle to become relevant once more. But Riggan isn't the only one who struggles with being relevant, we see the supporting cast also struggle as they too wish to be relevant. The film touches on film critics and makes the statement of how most film critics just give labels to everything and don't talk about story or structure, but rather they focus on grudges or jealousies they may hold for performers in the production. The film touches on celebrities and how they take a lot more credit for their work than they should, it also comments on how people instantly forget about one celebrity after x amount of years and move onto the new celebrity who is doing the exact same thing as the last celebrity.In summary Birdman is a excellent film that has been beautifully shot, crafted and performed into a masterpiece. Birdman is the best film of 2014 for me and it is definitely worth watching. 10/10.",10,1,9,7 February 2015
Toy Story 3," One of Pixar's Best Movies
","Ciaran- Toy Story 3 is one of my favourite animated movies as it portrays everything a animation should portray- friendship, loyalty and love. Toy Story 3 just wraps the animation and story into a beautiful movie. After watching the movie again, the camera angles and lighting this movie shows, in one scene where Buzz is locking up the other toys in every single shot in the scene Buzz is always in the light- however Lotso throughout the movie transitions from the light, then to half-light, then to darkness. I cried in this movie twice- in the inferno scene and the final goodbye scene. As i said before this is one of my favourite animated movies- i highly recommend this movie- 8/10.Jacob: I will always remember popping in the first two Toy Story VHS tapes and watching them endlessly. Like E.T. they perfectly capture the innocence and imaginative freedom of childhood, and this is essential for an emotional connection and a nostalgic feeling that those films gave us. Naturally I was very excited to hear of a new Toy Story in production. I saw it and loved it as much as the other Pixar productions. It was darker (not too dark), more emotional and had a charming sense of humour. I was actually splendidly surprised about the direction that that this film was taking. I was expecting just another adventure story that will lead to more sequels but this is the final chapter. Some remember the heartbreak they had when they have to give up something so close and personal and this film captures that perfectly. The villain is lots'o fun, the drama is there, the characters have returned and they are all witty and funny. The scenes with Barbie and Ken are absolutely hilarious. The ending is a but cheesy but is cheesy in good way, the kind that jerks a few tears or maybe a thunderstorm of emotions. 9/10",9,0,1,31 January 2014
Godzilla," A much needed revival.
","Ciaran: I went to my local cinema who had just received 3D and i watched what i though was going to be one of the better movies of the year. I don't know why i got myself hyped up so much because i just fell even further, so here is my review of Godzilla. Let's start with the acting with Johnson as our lead he really doesn't say much..at all, and when he does speak it is literally five words- now this didn't bother me too much just it did get annoying. Wantanabe provided a decent performance and he didn't say much either, heck pretty much nobody said much in this film, i think the only person who said anything more than five words was Cranston who was axed before the 30 minute mark. Now we move onto the CGI, and boy it was impressive, no flaws and actually quite convincing, except for maybe the flood scene, even so i am glad to see that the money went to the department that is needed the most in a film like this. Now onto the writing, what can you expect from a monster film, poor writing and not the greatest explanation for a story, the film itself was so predictable and so stereotypical it wasn't even funny, i just feel the movie could have been better if the writers (who also wrote Doom and The Expendables) could have put some more effort into their work. Now i come to the final and most important component, the action and it really did work, it was perfect, Godzilla's reveal- perfect, the fight scene in Hawaii- awesome and final battle in San Fransisco, well it was a little bit overdone but still i can bypass that and say with confidence that this remake was better than the 1998 version. I highly recommend you watch Godzilla as it is awesome, just not a great film therefore it receives a 6/10.Jacob's Review: I thoroughly enjoyed Godzilla. I was not expecting anything brilliant but I did want to be thrilled, scared and pumped and it delivered in those areas with only a few areas to improve on for me to call it a great monster movie. The acting was great, especially Bryan Cranston but the human characters could have been developed slightly more. The lead was was not too generic but did not offer much. I thought Cranston was the lead but it turns out that he was a secondary character. The film is ludicrous but not in a Pacific Rim way where everything is childishly stupid but there are some reality bending moments that I was willing to forgive such as people surviving great falls. I feel that if the movie focused more on panic from the human characters (which we spend most of the movie with) then the fear could have been more effective. People panic for sure but in some situations people are doing business as usual. And yes, there are monsters in this movie. A big surprise was two giant rhino beetles and a fat man in a lizard costume. I was surprised at how little of the title character was in this movie, however his reveal, design, roar and monstrous presence make it worthwhile. These creatures are portrayed more as animals and give a few explanations for how they operate. The flying Clover-field monsters feed on radioactive material and just radiation. They even eat radioactive waste from unused nuclear bombs. This movie has an enormous scope and goes as far as making Godzilla an anti-hero which is cheesy and confusing since he kills millions with just one step. A great, fun, modern action monster movie 8/10.",7,2,5,16 May 2014
