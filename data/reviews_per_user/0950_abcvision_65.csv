Skyfall," Mix it up with old school James Bond 007
","This was a movie I wanted to see opening weekend but finally when I saw it I was blown away. It is one of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. Skyfall combines some old school Bond with the new high tech one. A new villain has come to town using cyber terrorism to throw in chaos into the mix. Seeing to discredit the allusive M (Judi Dench) he manipulated the electronic cyber grid. Bond (Daniel Craig) loyal to M dives in to catch this cyber villain by using his bag of vintage tricks. With a trip into the country sound to Bond's childhood home driving his classic Aston Martin. With opening tunes by Adel, the traditional opening eye shot is held to the end and this 50th Anniversary flick shows that Bond is still the ultimate secret agent man.

The Hangover," A Classic
","In the opening scene The Hangover the big day has arrived, with Elvis lyrics in the background the cinematography pans over the preparations for the couples' nuptials that include all the trappings for the making of a white wedding. In a nonlinear fashion montage this story moves back and forth to reconstruct the boy's bachelor party night the day after.

So goes the mystery tale of the groom Doug (Justin Bartha) who is hosted on the ritualistic night to Las Vegas by his brother in law Alan (Zach Galifianaki) and best friends, Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms). A true adventure heist that will remind you that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas unless you want to remember then have someone keep notes or take good pictures. The Hangover is the perfect way to start either boys' or girls' night out in the city.",10,1,3,2 April 2013
Hereditary," La Familia

In the Hereditary you discover that when the matriarch dies so too many of her secrets. This creates an odyssey for the Graham family to discover what she really was all about.

Gravity," Space version of Cast away
","With the high reviews and large box office showing for the movie Gravity, I was really looking forward to it. I have always garnered an interest in space and this unknown frontier is a brave new world. I did see the movie in 2D, not 3D, but I believe that a good story is a good story no matter what format it is presented. It s about when the space shuttle is hit with space trash, debris and then thing run amuck. The two surviving astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) struggle to make it to an old abandoned Russian space station. With lots of heavy breathing and intense accompanied music, these scenes of a close death are built up. Sandra Bullock looks amazing and she plays her usual nervous, unsure character. Lacking where her usual snort laugh and giggle. I would recommend Gravity as a rental, and if you must see it, then check it out on 3D where objects will float all around you.

The Big Lebowski," The Dude
",I saw in the theater the 20 year anniversary showing of this cult classic. The dude is a still an interesting character as he deals with an array of individuals with competing interest. It is a funny and witty tale about finding your way and discovering how you fit in a complex situation. Long live the 'dude'.,9,1,2,13 August 2018
Fury," epic battle
","War is hell and we can't imagine the feeling of being in battle. But I believe that Fury does a good job of bringing that complexity of the fog of war onto the big screen. In Fury, Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) does a good job an average soldier rising to the occasion. He is leading a group of men in the finally of the European theatre in 1945. He has a deadly mission behind enemy lines. This cohort is outmanned, outgunned, and out strategized. These boys struggle to make it but know they are fighting for a bigger cause than themselves. The movie takes you to the front line and the complexity of trying to stay alive while there is death all around. More than a war movie, it is one that shares the story of forgotten heros. The men who risked it all for freedom. One heck of a movie. Wilson Trivino",8,3,7,31 January 2015
Inglourious Basterds," I could use a warm glass of milk
","In the tradition in Quentin Tarentino Inglorious Bastards is a wild adventure. It takes place as the Nazis are in control of France in the war that was suppose to end all wars War World II. The 'Jew Hunter', Colonel Hans Land was seeking out to eliminate and extinguish the Jews. In come the Americans lead by Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine who is coming in with the good guys. This movie has mystery, suspense and some sexiness mixed in with Shoshanna who plays the alluring Nazi Killer. The costuming is incredible and there are some pretty outrageous scenes that can make you squirm. With revenge in mind after seeing her family being executed Shoshanna plots to come back. With the signature line, 'do you have a glass of warm milk' Colonel Hans Land takes center stage and shows the remarkable acting of Christoph Waltz. A fantastic story and adventure of a life time.",10,0,2,10 April 2013
This Is the End," silly but fun
","Those who believe in the holy scripture are familiar with the rapture, the end of the world. In the south we hear often about it. Now in This is the End you get a sense of what it will be like. With a cast of notable Hollywood stars in Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride, they get caught up in being held up in a house. Suddenly their supplies run low and are forced to creep outside where some devilish creatures are there to create harms way. This sets up a unexpected scenario but the lines create some funny scenes. I unexpectedly found this to be an upbeat hilarious movie. It is not high brow humor but does come with a punch. So have you been saved? Well take note, the end may be closer than you think.",9,2,6,3 October 2013
Argo," Getting the good guys out
","With all the buzz of Argo I was excited to go and check out what the fuss is about. I must say that I loved it. It has politics, suspenseful, and even though you kinda know where it is heading there are several nail biting scenes. I sort of remember the hostages in Iran, I was ten at the time and do recall the yellow ribbons around the trees and the count up on the amount of days they were held. That event ensured that President Carter would not win a second term. In Argo, the embassy is overrun by unrolling Iranians in protest to the United States and a renegade of embassy workers, six in all, are able to escape to the Canadian Embassy. Then there is a conflict back in the US to how to rescue the Americans. In comes CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) who comes up with the ideal cover, that they workers are actually Hollywood scouts checking out scenes for a action flick. Ben Afleck both stars and directs, but he makes for a believable undercover agent who balances following his higher ups and taking care of his people. This movie is a must see of a story that recently has come out from declassified documents. One interesting reference is when they scramble to contact White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, they call under the auspices of calling from Pace Academy, a private school in Atlanta where his kids attended.",10,0,4,4 February 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The good Captain Sparrow
","<ul><li>With so many options to experience a movie from IMAX, 3D, surround or on a regular TV the options are overwhelming. I can now say I have been spoiled and can never go back. As part of the SuperPOPS! Concerts Series, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra played alongside of a full screen version of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. First the Friday night I attended on this two night series was packed; you simply could not fill another person in the room. This Pirates series revolves around the adventures of Captain Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who has a good heart but a mischievous spirit and a heart of a pirate. The kind Captain Sparrow simply wants to recapture a ship so that he can lead a team of merry men on the high seas. This is the problem; he crosses paths with wily Captain Barbossa who steals his ship the Black Pearl. Unbeknown to Sparrow the Barbossa crew has a curse that can only be removed from the blood of a living decedent of a pirate. With maiden Elizabeth Swann in the mix, the British fleet gets in the mix lead by a charming Commodore Norrington all to make a fun witty old school pirate tale. At first you think that the presence of a full orchestra will be a distraction but Conductor Richard Kaufman quickly took command of the ASO and they seamless blended into the background and you are transformed to a magical journey to the high seas. Simply a fantastic experience to see these artist in full swing and the only, I mean only way to see a movie. Coming up December is a full schedule of holiday treats, do not miss out to hear this music loud and reignite the spirit of the season.</li></ul>",10,0,1,6 December 2012

Who is John to choose? This movie is funny and Ted is a scene stealer as his lines are on mark. You just don't know what this furry friend is going to say or do. I could simply not stop laughing on the really funny lines that have been placed in this film. This is sure to be come a classic silly movie, you can't help but love a teddy bear.",Null,1,4,10 August 2012

All seems to be normal for him as he has his weekly routine, going to church, hanging out with his boys, and trying to add a few notches to his bed post.

A good movie about the complexity of relationships and finding the right one.",10,1,5,3 October 2013
Deadpool 2," On the road to no where
","I was really excited to see this movie as I like the first Deadpool. But like most sequels it fails to reach the level of the first one. It felt as the movie was patched together with a lot of bits. Ryan Reynolds does a good job of being the snarky Deadpool character but his one liners get old as the art of the story never seems to peak. With the introduction of so many other superhero characters with too much back story given, the simplicity of good guy versus bad guy is lost. I watched it on the big screen but it might be worth waiting for it to come out on streaming platform to watch on your lunch break. Dr. Wilson Triviño",5,1,2,19 June 2018
Match Point," Passion or Comfort
","Match Point starts off with a strong statement that much of life has to do with luck. Yes, hard work is a must but circumstances make a whole lot of difference. In this Woody Allen film, Match Point (2006) takes you on one wild ride between doing the right thing versus what passion moves you towards. In this film Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a former tennis star that has high hope in making something of himself. The tennis circuit took him from his humble beginnings but his new job as a tennis instructor at a private club opens the door to opulence. All is well until he falls for his future brother in law's girl Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) who has a femme-fetal allure that drives him to the edge. A suspenseful movie that wraps the unpredictable sides of human emotion, Match Point is a powerful film.",10,1,1,3 July 2014
BlacKkKlansman," Black power
","A movie based loosely on real life events, the unfortuate fate of the black man. What I found tiresome what the continued use of all the racial sterotypes you would expect. Slow moving in some parts. It was interesting to peek behind the veil of the KKK.",4,1,5,6 September 2018
Begin Again," Loving glances
","Begin Again is a sweet movie about the fragility of love. How it can be there one moment and gone the next. Gretta (Keira Knightley) and Dave (Adam Levine) were bound together with the struggle to make it in the music world and mutual infatuation. Suddenly Dave makes it and moves on while leaving Gretta behind. In comes in Dan (Mark Ruffalo) and sees potential in her music. Dan has his own love troubles and dealing with a stagnant career as a music executive. Dan is the ultimate 'Mr. Nice Guy'. Lots of loving glances and creative innocence is experienced on the big screen and this tale is about self discovery and the complexity of dealing with change. Regardless of what life throws at you, you got to believe in your dreams and move forward because in the end it all works out. Overall it is a feel good movie of the normal lives of regular folks who are struggling to make it.",6,1,2,26 July 2014
Suicide Squad," Trust no evil
","Sometimes to combat evil you must use some evil. The premise of Suicide Squad is that a top secret cohort of despicable criminals are put together to fight a world threat. The first part of the movie is intense back story. So much that I felt I needed to take notes. Then you have these bad dudes assembled and they conflict with their handlers. To me the movie had the potential to be awesome but was a blend of bits rolled into one. Very intense fighting scenes that were obviously created with 3D in mind. Theses misfits come together to create their own family and seek to discover what is really important- family, friends and an honorable word. Harley Quinn does not disappoint as the sultry villainess. These heroes are on a self destructive odyssey. All for one and one for all. This movie takes you oo the road less traveled. One might ask, can evil be trusted?",6,1,5,9 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Save the day
","Captain America is back and this time he is mixed in the modern world of terror. He is the ultimate good guy who embodies the American values in an age where American has changed. A good action packed movie and Scarlett Johansson is more than mere eye candy in this film, she plays a good black widow in Natasha. Samuel Jackson really grasp the character as the head of the secret security force. Some old enemies in the Russians pop up but the Cap is ready to take them on with some good ole American know how. This is a good movie if you suspend reality of the laws of gravity and are ready to see an epic battle between good and evil. Robert Redford does a good job and makes for a believable inside guy. This movie rocks!",10,0,2,10 May 2014

American Sniper," American hero
","American Sniper follows the career of Chris Kyle, a patriot who has been credited with the most kills as a sniper. This movie also delves in the complexities of readjusting to life after war. Chris had four tour of duties and then return to his home a bit broken. This movie is intense and has been nominated as Best Picture Oscar race and is directed by Clint Eastwood. My prediction is that this film will win because it is timely as it hits on a subject that is relevant to our time. The wars, the cost, and the complexity of reintegrating these broken soldiers when they return home. Bradley Cooper captures the essence of Chris Kyle and in an outstanding portrayal of a complex character.",10,14,32,28 January 2015

He has the gift of tinkering with mechanical objects and is driven to find out what will make a certain mechanical robot work. This was one that was passed from his father and serves as a link to the past. Hugo is now without his detractors as the Station Inspector are bound to rid him of this underground world.

We're the Millers," Puff the magic dragon
","We're The Miller's is a lightheaded comedy and the ultimate pot head's dream assignment. To bring in a pinch of grade A maryjane from Mexico. Seems like an easy assignment and David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) decides to come over with the cover of a family vacation. Nothing is hotter than Jennifer Anniston (Rose O'Reilly) as the dotting wife and the two happy along kids. This movie is basic story line with a few mixed in twist in turns. If you want to take the ultimate road trip, then check out this flick. There are some funny lines and the adventure is crazy.

The Fault in Our Stars," Love
","I have not read the book that the movie Fault in Our Stars is based on but I have heard good things about it. The movie is good. Interesting in a world of social media and the information age, the one thing this generation is striving for is love and human connection. I watched this film late one night with a room full of tweeners and a bit older crowd. I heard the girls swoon to the characters and even shed a tear or two. The story revolves around two teenagers, Hazel and Gaus, who both are diagnosed with terminal disease. They don't focus on their limited time or share in their anger that they will never grow old but fate has it they find each other. This combination of souls are the ideal of any romantic and what Hollywood seems probable on the big screen is often not true in real life when mixed up with the complexity of life. There are some very touching scenes and even an old cynic like me was warmed by this movie that rekindled my inner yearning for a happily ever after.",10,0,1,12 July 2014

It is a story of a man sharing his life's story as he was a protégé of a famous concierge for a grand hotel. The ups and downs of life in the hospitality industry is quite an adventure. There is even a mystery involving a famous painting in the mix. A marvelous tale from an era when hotels were stately and full of wonder. This movie is a bit static at times and long winded. But the scenery is full of old school class. The shifting back and forth can be confusing at time. But the relationships are good and the characters rich.,7,4,7,28 January 2015
Foxcatcher," winning
",This is a story I was not familiar one. It is about John E. Dupont and his quest to come from under the scrutiny of his family and find love and approval from his mother. He does this by seeking to build and coach the ultimate wrestling team. The Schultz brothers were already known in wrestling circles but DuPont gave them the platform to get better. What happens in the course of the movie is interesting. It shows how money and all the material things can give a person the inner grit to win. Steve Carrell portrays Dupont in the perfect manner and is break form his comedic type he usually portrays. Channing Tatum in portraying the brother Mark also pushes the envelope as he accurately paints the solitary life of an athlete the pressures to perform and win. A good movie based on a memoir by Mark Schultz.,8,5,11,28 January 2015
Gone Girl," Desperately seeking Amy
","Gone Girl the movie is based on the book by Gillian Flynn. I read the book and the movie follows the book plot pretty much along the same line. They did a good job of keeping the suspense along the way. It is about a girl, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) who goes missing. Her husband Nick Dunne rallies to garner support and help from the community. Along the way, Nick's life becomes a media sensation and his life under the public focus because to get scrutinize. A bit long at about 149 minutes but it kept my interest along the way. Good pace and makes you rethink that before you meet with the police get an attorney. Police are not your friend and the state is the ultimate decider on your basic freedoms. I would recommend this for anyone that likes a good suspense filled story.",10,0,6,8 November 2014

","Time moves on the boys from 21 Jumpstreet move to the bigger and better 22 Jumpstreet. This includes more adventure and heroic action as Schmidt and Jenko go under deep cover to see how the millennials work hard and play hard in college. The first half of the movie moves quickly with gags and lots of unexpected twist and turns, only to shift to the second half with a more serious dynamic between these buds. College life is a different world and it show case the care free attitude of these students that are ready to dominate their future.

","An Academy Award winning film and starring Al Pacino, Dog Day Afternoon follows the afternoon that created a modern robin hood. I watched this movie after watching the documentary Dog on the broader life of Sonny Wortzik. In the movie Dog Day Afternoon, Sonny (Al Pacino) needs some money so he goes to the source, the bank. In his head the plan was simple, he and his other two accomplices were going to go in and walk out with a cool stash but his plan got a bit murky. With the advantage of time for me, this film really captures the 1970s and it's a time capsule to the decade of my birth. The clothes, hair, and an attitude made me more curious of this broader bank heist. It is a heck of a story.",8,0,1,26 August 2014

Unfortunately this crime fighter cannot stay away from saving lives and continues his double life as Spiderman. This movie has a slow build up as it develops the complex relationship with is love Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and builds up the development of Electro (Jamie Foxx). Peter Parkers long lost friend appears and becomes a rival in the Green Goblin and layers of other drawn out story lines are painted. If you are a spider man fan, it might be right for you. If you are not, it might be a movie you see in bits because it gets very long winded at times but will hopefully make you appreciate these creepy crawlers the next time you see one.",7,1,4,31 May 2014

The group of folks recruited were the best of the best, the task seemed easy enough but the group was not really prepared for the outlining complexities outside the confines of the Enigma project. Politics, intrigue and the complexity of fitting within the geopolitical world of war. It also make a more subtle point that the real reason the Allies won the war was that they knew the German play book. By breaking the code, they were one set ahead of the battle and if true, is sure to change the entire historic narrative of War World II. Fine acting and has been nominated for an Oscar as best picture category.",7,0,3,28 January 2015
Selma," rise up
","The movie Selma attempts to capture a pivotal moment of the Civil Rights movement and the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The events that led up to and followed the crossing of the Edmund Petus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. This movie was filmed in Georgia, so it was neat to see some Georgia landmarks that were the backdrop of Alabama in the 1960s. A wide and diverse cast that captured a perspective of that era. Regardless of all the historic criticism of the film, it at least is introducing this story to a new generation of Americans. Very timely with all the race relation issues that our nation face today. A struggle that continues today.",8,2,5,28 January 2015
La La Land," Young Love
","A movie that should have won picture of the year, La La Land is a movie about hope. It is a love story and big dreams.

Les Misérables," Old school 'occupy' movement
","I have seen the stage version of Les Misérables and must say the movie version has taken it to a whole new level. It is absolutely amazing the way they took it from the stage to the big screen. The uprising of the lower class reminded me of a modern occupy movement that the 'Misérables' stated 'we are not going to take it anymore'. It has all the elements of a good story, a love interest, jealously, and a clash to the death. Hugh Jackman, as Jean Valjean carried this film and did a top job. It was funny to see Russell Crowe sing as that is a role I usually don't think of him in but he did it. Anne Hathaway as Fantine did well but Amanda Seyfriend emotions ran through. I totally did not expect to see Sacha Baron Carter whose role as Thénadier was a caricature of his normal self. Take a visit to old France and fall in love with Les Misérables, this is sure to become a modern classic.",8,4,7,4 February 2013
The Shape of Water," LOve happens
","I literally fell into the shape of water. I walked into the theatre not knowing what to expect. I thought it was going to be another scary movie. But instead I was pleasantly surprised because it was a story about Love. How two misfits come together to celebrate a connection. The invaluable importance of loyalty and friendship. How often we tend to disregard the misunderstood and the individuals or things that live on the fringe of a predictable world. This movie touched my heart and gives me hope about finding acceptance in the world that wants to categorize people, things, and events into a neat and organized order.",Null,17,34,3 January 2018
Sausage Party," bun bites
","Not your typical animation, Sausage Party is a look into one of the modern world's obsession-food. It delves into the grocery aisles and tells the story from their perspective. Where the love interest of a particular hot dog and bun yearning for each other so intense that they delve into tip play. Raunchy at times, this adolescent humor is funny at times and as long as you enter with that in mind, the movie is pretty good. No stereotype is left behind as you discover a talking taco and whole cast of misfits. The hot dog through his odyssey discovers foods fate and uses it as a cause to warn others. The danger of the human gods and how food nourishes their cravings. There are tender moments where the foods come together for a united front. These horny treats leave nothing behind as the audience is left with there is not better to satisfy a craving that indulge in a little food play. I liked the movie and enjoyed a hearty laugh even when I knew I should not have.",10,29,64,12 August 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," living on the edge
","This is a really action packed good movie. Tom Cruise plays Cage, a PR military man who comes to help put spin into a messy war front. Not fitting in to the frontline he is sent to play soldier, only to discover he is caught in a time vortex where he keeps repeating the same day over and over again all the while the aliens fight to take over the world. A very intense movie that creates a believable fog of war experience. The lights and sounds and the chaos of being on the battle field. Tom Cruise really makes this movie as his intensity helps guide the good guys into what seems a lost cause. The movie makes you realize the fine line between reality and imagination and the easy way in which our perspective can misguide us and make us question our own sanity.",10,1,3,7 July 2014

","Whiplash is a fast moving story of the cut-throat music world of competing to become the best of the best. Andrew (Miles Teller) is determine to make it. He finds a spot on the very competitive Jazz section led by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). This story has grit and makes you appreciated the good sounds we get to experience around us. Paul Riser plays Andrew's dad and makes a fine showing. The lesson found in this film is that the ups and downs of the road of success are tough, but at the end, dreams are possible if you are willing to work for them. Nominated for five Oscars, including best picture and directed by Damien Chazelle.",8,0,2,28 January 2015

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," fly
","Birdman has many fascinating themes and an up and close personal perspective of the drama behind the scenes world of live theatre. The tribulations of an aging movie star attempt to a comeback. The complexity of the modern family dynamics. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson who has put all he has on the line to bring a play production onto Broadway. The cinematography is good and I love the continuous camera shot scenes. Keaton creates a believable role as it were to seem to imitate life as Keaton was a past super hero in Batman. Riggan is a tormented man who fights with his internal demons. An impressive cast with Edward Norton, Zach Galinfianakis and Amy Ryan to name a few. This movie is bold, has depth, and fun to watch, perfect for theatre goers or those that like to watch a train wreck up close and personal.",10,4,12,29 November 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman Rises
",The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most intense super hero movies I have watched. The opening scene is intense as the bad guys swing into action to get the good guys as the plane is moving into a tail spin. This time the world is void of the Bat crusader as he is in mourning the loss of his beloved. The plot lines are mix as you feel at times you need a chart to know who the good and bad guy is. The thread though out the movie is dark and deep and the most dramatic character is the bad guy Bane appears to take over the city of Gotham. A long movie that will keep you in total suspense until the end of the run. This movies does a good job of bringing into the mix several story lines from the comic book series. bravo!,Null,9,15,10 August 2012
Black Panther," Wakanda forever
","Black Panther had quite the buzz. I finally got to see it and was pleasantly surprise. Often these big buzz movies are a let down. It tells the story of Wakanda, a country in Africa that has pretty much stayed true to itself. The black panther is pass down in a monarchy chosen by the people. Black Panther wants to pass along some good to the world and opens this nation to the eyes of others. Many scenes from Atlanta and good to see a new character brought to life on the big screen. Wakanda forever. Dr Wilson Triviño",7,0,1,20 June 2018
Lucy," Brain power
","Lucy starts off with the introduction of an ordinary girl who is trying to make it in Asia. Lucy simply stumbles across a bad situation and gets caught in an international drug ring. This sets off a series of events that create an expansion of Lucy's brain capacity. Research says that we use only 10% of our brain, but what if we could ramp it up and be able to use all of it. This would seem incredible but would this be ability that we would really want. Lucy is incredible, fast pace, full of suspense and points to questions, without passing judgment or being preachy. Scarlett Johansson showcases her full broad skills as an actress as she transitions from a sex kitty to a genius scientific intellectual in the course of the movie. An remarkable movie that makes you think that sometimes it is better not to go full throttle but slow down and enjoy a smaller capacity and pace in the way we process the world around us. Lucy is a winner for those who like to think about the world of possibilities.",10,11,26,26 July 2014
Flight," Up up and away
","It is amazing to me that you can take a chunk of metal, mixed in nuts and bolts and attach some engines and you can fly pristinely across the sky. More importantly are the pilots that guide these crafts through the air. Flight is quite a movie, it chronicles the self assured pilot Whip Witaker (Denzel Washington) as he takes the controls of a typical flight from Orlando to Atlanta. Along the way, the flight hits some turbulence and begins a free fall. Whip keeps the calm and uses all his skills to guide the craft. The scene is riveting and I caught myself closing my eyes, is it going to crash or not? After the big event the investigator come in and seek a scapegoat, was the incident caused by mechanical malfunction or pilot error. This movie is full of suspense and is one hell of a ride.",7,2,3,29 November 2012
Unbroken," Stand strong

As a soldier he survived a plane accident and survived 47 days at sea. Not to top that, he went on to survive a Japanese prison of war camp. The movie is grueling at times, but I believe captures the complexities of the fog of war. A remarkable story and one that inspires. Directed by Angelina Jolie and is nominated for 3 Oscars. Regardless of the critics, it is a good movie. It is an adventure entering an era long gone. Makes you appreciate the grit of those tough old guys.",7,6,12,28 January 2015
Godzilla," his name is godzilla
","The highlight for me of this movie was when Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) seriously makes the statement, 'They call him Godzilla' as he shares the tale of this urban legend. In this movie, after a nuclear reactor meltdown it awakens a roach looking creature in Japan. This creature seeks to mate and travels the world looking for radiation and its male counterpart. In comes Godzilla, ready to save the day with its fire breath and larger body that tears into major cities as it fights these two larger 'cockroaches'. The effects are pretty amazing as downtown Las Vegas and San Francisco are destroyed, the power grid failure makes you sense how vulnerable our modern apparatuses can be. Our military seems amateurish as it seeks to destroy these threats. Many scenes are reminiscent and pay homage to past Godzilla renditions when you see folks running and stopping in their tracks as they yell out 'Godzilla'.",10,9,20,31 May 2014
The Hangover Part III," The Mayhem continues
","The wolf pack is back. This time they are going in to take care of one of their own, Alan (Zack Galifianakis). He seems to have a lot of evil in his life and they want him to realize that he needs to cleanse himself of his life of drugs, bad decisions, and bad company. All is well until Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) appears back on the scene. This time he is a man on the run and this makes for another mayhem adventure. Lots of actions pack scenes where the gang gets close to the edge and back. Doug even sparks a new love interest in Cassie (Melissa McCarthy). Lots of funny scenes and low brow references that have become a hallmark of the Hangover series, there is even a bit of a teaser for a continuing of the series in the end credits, so stay tuned. Could there be a Hangover IV? Who knows but for this one the wolf pack boys are back in town.",7,12,15,21 April 2014
Incredibles 2," There is only a first time
","Superheros are back in vogue that's what the incredibles 2 is all about. Trying to make superheroes great again. As the family was put in hiding because they were outlawed, now comes an advocate trying to showcase the benefits of having these figures back on the street and out in the open. The movie does move slow and does not have the finesse of the first film. A few good lines but as in most sequels, that train has left the station. After a fun Incredibles 1, they had to disappoint with an Incredibles 2. Dr Wilson Trivino",3,96,189,26 June 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," On the road again..
","There is no place like home and that is where the misfits of the New York Zoo want to go back to. Once again, the lion Alex (Ben Stiller), the zebra Marty (Chris Rock), the hippo Gloria (Zada Pinkett Smith), and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) lead the gang as they yearn to leave the savanna of Africa to the vibrancy of the city.

Slumdog Millionaire," Good life
",We are a sum of all our experiences. In this tale a contestant winning steak is questioned not because of what he knows but because of where he comes from. It retraces his life's journey. This movie highlights those unimaginable poor slums and the complexity of class in modern society. The movie is as fresh today as when it came out. Dr Wilson TriviÃ±o,10,0,0,7 September 2018
Warm Bodies," Heartwarming
","In Warm Bodies the world is in shambles, the population is split between the zombies, the skeletons, and the humans. Julie seeks refuge outside the bubble of existence and gets in a bit a trouble, only to befriend a zombie who takes a liking to her. This unexpected adventure seeks to understand the divide between the living and the dead. Some good intense scenes and with John Malkovich, you are taken on a wild naughty adventure. It gives new meaning to the old maxim 'can't we simply get along?' The movie does a good job of making light the often serious consequences of turning into a zombie. It also showcases how youth is wasted on the young and sometimes they see what their elders fail to admit.",9,1,5,13 February 2013
Jurassic Park," IN 3D - back to the 90s
","I remember attending the first screening for Jurassic Park in the 90s and there was much hype about this bigger than life theatrical experience. 20 years later it seems like a time capsule from the 90s. The 3D experience does enhance a few scenes but overall the movie seems a bit dated. Interesting about all these movies in the past that were look into the future missed the entire cell phone craze. Some of the scenes where DNA sequences are manipulated have turned into true modern science. Our expectations are more than was delivered in the special effects but it was nostalgic to catch glimpses of these young stars, especially a very young Samuel Jackson. The movie is about the ultimate theme park composed of Dinosaurs but oh no suddenly something goes wrong. Based on a novel by Michael Crichton and is produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald Molen and directed by Stephen Spielberg. So if you want a trip to the 90s with funky colored glasses then this is the movie for you.",7,3,6,2 April 2013
Furious 7," I like to go fast
","It took 7 Fast and Furious movies before I actually sat down and watched a whole movie. I had seen bits and pieces of others but this one was my first. It teaches me that you can save the world with fast cars, lots of bikini clad females, and long stares by the actors. This story sets off with an explosive chase, the crew is brought back together to save the world against an evil forces. They move fast, talk fast, and act fast. But in the end, the need for speed is clear and this is one tale that will keep your head spinning. This movie is an adventure that will keep you going. I hate to say it, but I am ready for Fast and Furious 8 and go back to see the foundations. Dr Wilson Trivino",8,0,2,17 April 2015
