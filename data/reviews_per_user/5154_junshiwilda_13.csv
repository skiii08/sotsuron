First Man," üëçA good idea executed in a way I am very mixed.
","If you are expecting this movie to be a space adventure like Apollo 13, you would be wrong. First man would offer you more than just a adventure to the moon. Resisting the temptation to make a pop corn entertainment about the moon landing mission itself, Damien Chazelle decided to make a human drama and a character study of Neil Armstrong himself. Though many have criticized this for not being a movie like Apollo 13 but about a successful landing instead of a unsuccessful one, I personally really respect the direction of a human drama they went for. Instead of doing what came before, Damien Chazelle took a risk by making a movie no one expected from the source material. Even though I like the direction they went for, the final product which is the film itself I have very mixed feelings.There are many fantastic aspects about this movie. The look of the film itself is very good from the sound mixing to the production design. It was nominated for 4 oscars and won 1 for visual effects, and I think they were all well deserved nominations. There is not a single bad performance and many of the best performances of this year was actually from this movie. Ryan Gosling does a phenomenal job as Louis Armstrong and Claire Foy of course gives a amazing Oscar worthy performance as Neil Armstrong's wife. The script is well written in a way that it literally digs deep into Armstrong's character and of course the score is fantastic. In general there is just some fantastic moments inside this movie worth watching. However, I do have issues with many aspects that almost outweigh the positive aspects.
The big problem I have with this movie is the tone. Since this movie is a character study, it digs deep into the past regrets and losses Neil Armstrong has experienced. Therefore the film naturally goes into a more darker direction quite literally. Inside this movie there are numerous funeral scenes, and Neil Armstrong himself is portrayed as a cold emotionless man. I can see that they wanted to show how there were many losses and emotional punches people had to experience to make the moon landing possible in order to make it respectful, but I think their attempt to be respectful backfired a bit and became a bit disrespectful. What I mean by that is by making a movie centered in loses and regrets, this movie just became pure depressing which I personally don't think fits the source material. Even in the final moon landing sequence this movie didn't have the triumphant atmosphere this event deserved, and the conclusion to Neil Armstrong's character arc was pretty ambiguous and unredeeming. As I said before I really do respect the direction they went for, but I just think the end result was a bit too disrespectful by being overly dark and depressing.
Overall this is a movie I have very mixed feelings about. Though I didn't like the overall outcome of the movie, there is just a lot of phenomenal moments inside this film. Many people actually love this film, and if you say you loved it I would not argue since I can see why. I rate this a 6/10 and a C-. Though I am not sure whether or not I can recommend this, it's still a thumbs up and do consider this a positive review.",6,2,3,24 November 2018
Forrest Gump," üëç Excellent...just simply excellent.
","I just re watched Forrest Gump on Netflix and it was excellent. I usually don't get surprised if a certain movie has a criminally low score on Rotten tomatoes since I don't expect the people who claim Black Panther is the greatest movie ever made to have brains. But the 71% tomatometer score of this movie was just down right insulting. This is a heart warming yet powerful movie that deserves a spot in the list of greatest movies ever made.If you haven't seen this movie for some odd reasons, this essentially is a historical drama telling major events of American history through the eyes of Forrest Gump, a low IQ Alabama man who coincidentally encounters those events. He experiences many worlds ,many occupation all because he trusted this world and the people he met. Many criticize the film for having a very bad moral that the more stupid you are the more successful you will be. If you are one of those people, you are misunderstanding this whole movie. If this movie was just about Forrest acting stupid that argument will be valid. But what this movie wants to ask you is whether life has a purpose or it is just a coincidence. The movie does not offer a answer, but it does offer hints. Throughout the movie Forrest meets many people that shape him and become a influence in his life. Those are his mother, Jenny, lieutenant Dan, and Bubba. Yes Forrest did live a life that was full of coincidences. But the people he met and how they shaped him serve as counter point to the idea that life is coincidental. If you have this movie a negative review, I ask you to review watch it and think to yourself as you watch it. I am pretty sure you would have a different view on the movie after you watch it.Overall this is a phenomenal movie that is a heart warming feel good movie that is powerful at the same time. It is filled with great lines and memorable performances of course from Tom Hanks and many other. Though I don't give a lot of these out, I think I will give this a 10/10 and a A+.",10,1,2,11 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," üëç (Oscars 2019 review # 5) Good movie that could have been a masterpiece.
","Bohemian Rhapsody is perhaps the audience favorite among the Best Picture nominees along with Green Book. It has a 8.0 IMDb rating and a 86% audience score on RT. The general audience have loved this film and almost everyone whom I talked to had a great experience. However, despite being one of the audience favorites in the whole Oscar race Bohemian Rhapsody is perhaps one of the controversial picks in the history of Oscars. It is clear from the 61% RT score that critics didn't really love this movie all that much. If you read individual critical reviews many say that this movie carved of all the edges just to make a passable PG13 movie. Though I don't agree with the critics all that much, I will say believe the critics for this one.As this is a positive review the positives obviously outweigh the negatives. Many say Rami Malek was excellent in his role as Freddie Mercury and yes I totally agree. Though I was not familiar with Malek's previous works, he indeed is a solid carbon copy of Freddie Mercury. He delivers the kind of performance that will never be forgotten and with his charisma he just makes you want to just sing along. He truly did deserve all the praise he received and though I personally liked Christian Bale's performance more I do not have any complaints at all on Rami winning Best Actor. The movie was well paced over all and the performance sequences were all fantastic. To me the Live Aid performance sequence was absolutely phenomenal. The movie ends in a bang and I was just knocked out by how brilliant the whole sequence was. It made me want to clap and shout bravo when the credits started rolling. I can imagine myself buying this movie on blue ray and that is largely because of the fantastic performance by Rami Malek and the phenomenal stage performances.The big problem I have with this movie is similar to the critics. Though I wasn't very familiar with the history of Queen I did know that Freddie Mercury was a very troubled man with many issues in life. I was very surprised by how this film touched very lightly on the singer's troubles and just went on ignoring them. Count me in as one of the people who didn't have a problem with all the historical inaccuracies, but I was a bit frustrated by how shallow this film decided to be by very lightly diving into the man's troubled life. Despite all the amazing performances and phenomenal stage sequences I was frustrated by how much potential it threw away for just being 'Family friendly'. First man, a movie I did have very mixed feelings about became inappropriately dark because of how the film dived into the regrets of the character of Neil Armstrong. I personally think they could have wrote the script in a similar manner to First man diving into the character of Freddie Mercury because unlike First man, this is a source material that is perfect for the script template used in First man. Yes I do believe this is a solid movie but I am frustrated to see how though they were easily able to make a great movie they chose to make a passable family entertainment movie. It is kind of like seeing a hiker close to the mountain top but deciding to stop 2/3rds away from the top.Overall this is a movie I can understand why it is a audience favorite. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest you see it in the theaters or somewhere with a great sound system. Trust me, the performance by Rami Malek and the phenomenal Live Aid sequence will 'Rock' you. I rate this a 7/10 and yes this is a solid thumbs up. Though this is a very good movie it is a bit shallow film.",7,0,1,18 July 2019
Dunkirk," üëçNot close to Nolan's best, but a very good movie.
","I was blown away when I saw Dunkirk in the theaters. It was so thrilling just from the beginning sequence, and it kept that fast paced thriller until the end. The film is told in 3 perspectives;the land, the sky , and the sea. In all of those perspectives,I experienced a non stop thrill ride along with Hans Zimmer's score that sounds literally like a timer. The whole film is crafted with the fast paced tempo and time limitations. I really had a great experience watching it in a IMAX theater, and I just thought I was actually there in the movie.The only problem I have with this film is that it is a Christopher Nolan film. I felt like this film didn't have the complexity and uniqueness most of his other films have. Meaning this film doesn't feel like a Nolan film, and I will disagree with those of you who say Dunkirk is the best entry to Christopher Nolan's filmography. But overall, this is one of the best film made in 2017, and I will definitely recommend it.",8,4,6,1 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," üëçThe MCU concludes beautifully
","Avengers Endgame is perhaps one of the most anticipated movies for comic book fans. Though I myself will not refer to myself as a big fan of the genre and the MCU in general, this was a truly epic and beautiful conclusion to the 22 movies in the MCU.Probably what makes this movie work wonderfully is the challenges the characters have to face. After where Infinity war ended, the characters are in a low point. They have to deal with loss and regrets from the previous movie, and some are struggling to find their purpose. They eventually all find a way out of their low point towards the end of the movie and each character has a satisfying conclusion to their arcs. Their character arcs are very intriguing and their emotional journey is very relatable. Even people like me who are not Marvel fan boys were very intrigued to the movie because of these amazing character arcs. That is probably why some of the deaths that took place in the movie was so heartbreaking even for me who hasn't saw all of the marvel movies.Beyond that, this is a film that fits the phrase 'epic'. The scale of the film which spans almost all of the major plot points of the franchise feels truly epic, and the final battle sequence is just phenomenal. It is a sequence that will literally set your soul on fire and want to spring out of your seat the instance Captain America says 'Avengers assemble'. Many would say the highlights of this film are those big action sequences and time traveling sequences, but for me the best part of the movie was the ending. The ending in my opinion is the best way to close this movie packed with epic moments and character arcs. It offers a very satisfying end to the arcs of these characters built in this entire franchise, especially to Captian America who finally gets to go back to his loved one and is seen dancing before the movie ends. I will not spoil this ending because it is very good, but this movie just ends in a way that is very emotionally satisfying.Overall this movie is a amazing, epic conclusion to the MCU that can be enjoyed by both comic book fans and non comic book fans like myself. I do have minor issues about how a certain character is killed off and some unclear concepts, but nothing worth bringing up. I rate it a 9/10 and I highly recommend you watch this in the theatre right away.",9,2,3,3 May 2019
JFK," üëç I get mad just thinking about this movie
","JFK is a movie that always frustrates me. I am not frustrated because it is bad or the historical inaccuracies people point out. Rather because it's so good it always angers me how underrated this masterpiece is. This of course did receive generally good reviews with a 83% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 72 Metascore, I think this deserves more than just 'generally favorable reviews'. Many trash this movie which I, with all due respect, don't get why. If you haven't seen this movie I demand you to stop reading this review, get up the couch and go buy this movie right now.
As you can guess from the very 'creative' title, this movie is about the investigation of the JFK assassination centering district attorney Jim Garrison played by Kevin Costner. This movie is even speaking visually a masterpiece. The editing is excellent using both black & white and color masterfully to create this sense of mystery. The performances are all excellent with the obvious ones being Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones who give unforgettable performances, and the score of course is phenomenal. But what makes this movie so wonderful is how this it is perfectly written. If there is a way to describe this movie, it is that the conspiracy gets uglier as it gets going. What I mean by that is first the film starts with a pretty simple well known hypothesis that Oswald actually did not kill Kennedy. But as the three hour runtime proceeds, the conspiracy gets as big as the involvement of LBJ and the White House. As the facts get presented you can see how the truth is uglier than what we know from the Warren commission, and how there is a bigger power preventing us from knowing the truth. At the climax of the movie, Oliver Stone challenges us, 'Is the justice system we live in really practice justice?' This is a movie that we all want to ignore to avoid the most shameful truth of our justice system, but as Americans we must face this and question the system we currently have.
Overall this is a terrific movie that is very criminally overlooked. I honestly can't understand why this is not on the IMDb top 250 in a world where Hachi: A Dog's tale and a bunch of Bollywood musicals can make it in. This is a perfect example that IMDb overlook real masterpieces like this one and are just obsessed with Indian movies (Like seriously! Why is IMDb obsessed with Indian movies!). Though I don't give a lot of these, I give this one a 10/10 and a A+. It is very unfortunate the maximum rating is 10/10 in IMDb, since if there is no limitations I would rate this a 20/10.",10,24,30,9 May 2019
Aladdin," üëç Very close to a total train wreck, but Will Smith saves the day.
","Aladdin 2019 is one of those live action Disney movies punched out every year. This movie was included in Watch Mojo's list of films already hated before release, and I was pretty reluctant to see it. But after seeing this film making lots of money and topping Avengers Endgame in the weekend Box Office I decided to give this one a watch just to see what the fuss was all about. Despite going into the theater with reluctance I did have a generally positive experience with this film.As many point out Will Smith is fantastic in this movie. He just plays the Geenie perfectly with humor and charisma and I personally prefer him over Robin Williams. Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud did do a good enough job but their performance obviously feels a bit dull in comparison to Will Smith because he is a real scene stealer. The production design was good enough especially the looks of the street though some of the CGI was pretty bad. Most of the songs from the original is back and especially the ones Will Smith sings are really worth watching. Though many had problems with Guy Richie's direction I personally think some of the scenes were very well directed with the Magic carpet ride scene being being the stand out. The ending of Genie's character arc (which I wouldn't spoil) was actually better than the original to me. I do understand this is debatable but I think Geenie's character arc's conclusion was more emotionally touching than the animated one.As you would expect from the Disney live action remakes movement this movie is a beat to beat remake of the animation. There is nothing really different except for obviously the ending as I mentioned, so this movie may feel dull to some people. But what they do add is some modern day politics. It is very clear that they wanted to turn princess Jasmine into a feminist icon and you can tell that from the new songs they added for Jasmine to sing. I understand many like the new musical numbers but to me they were just # Times Up propaganda music. They also changed the ending in a way that doesn't make sense at all just to cram in SJW politics. I would not spoil it, but you would see it no matter how non political you are. In addition, probably due to the release of Vice by Adam McKay, Disney for some reasons decided to portray the Bush administration and the invasion of Iraq in a PG rated Kid's movie through their main villain Jafar. Jafar's plans to invade some random country sounds perfectly like the invasion of Iraq by the Bush administration. Though it was amusing to see Disney lecturing children on modern day politics through a Family film it was frustrating to see that all the filmmakers were able to do was just add SJW politics and political allegory into the classic animation. As I mentioned before some of the editing was occasionally distracting especially the random slow motions and though the CGI was not as distracting I did not like it at all in the third act when Jafar turned into a hilarious CGI monstrosity. To summarize the negatives this movie suffers from being a beat to beat remake and being extremely predictable and to some very dull. But fortunately to me Will Smith saved this movie from being a dull remake to a enjoyable experience.Overall this is one of those movies that get saved from the performance and charisma of the leading cast. It is like spider man saving a very close train wreck all by himself in Spider Man 2, and Will Smith indeed has saved us from a train wreck. This movie could have been a very dull movie that offers basically the same thing with SJW politics sprinkled at the top. But Will Smith who has a great sense of humor and great chemistry with even the dullest character made this film a very good experience. I rate this a 6/10, and though this isn't a very high score this still is a thumbs up and a positive review.",6,1,3,25 July 2019
The Terminal," üëçUnderrated. Extremely underrated.
","You might think I am a idiot, but I think The Terminal is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. However, many people actually consider this the worst of the director's entries which honestly with all due respect I don't understand why. It is a heart warming and moving tale about a East European tourist who came all the way to the U.S to grant a simple promise. Tom Hanks gives a incredible performance with his European accent, and in general, there are many lovable characters in this movie. The story is well crafted with many humor, and it explores the theme of 'waiting' really well. The score by John Williams is really heartwarming, and it has all the things that make a movie good. I do not understand why people hate this heartwarming masterpiece, and if you have not saw this, ignore those people who trash this film and go watch it.",8,4,6,20 November 2018
Black Panther," üëç( Oscars 2019 reviews #3) Not Best Picture worthy, but let's just chant Michael B Jordan forever!
","Black Panther is perhaps the most surprisingly hyped movie of all time. It holds a 98% on rotter tomatoes where actual big name film critics like Peter Travers gave this full stars. It was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture and won 3 making it the film that won the most Oscars just behind Bohemian Rhapsody. If you ever read any of my reviews you will probably know I always use Black Panther as a scapegoat, but I actually am giving this a positive review. Though I believe this is a good movie I still don't believe this deserves Oscar nominations.Black Panther is perhaps one of the more distinct movie inside the MCU. It follows a shakespearien story structure rather than a MCU origin story template like movies such as Doctor Strange. I was able to have a very fresh experience to watch a movie that is not a formulaic superhero origin story. The action sequences were excellent especially the casino fight scene which was the stand out scene for me. But the secret sauce that makes this movie work is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan. This villain is written very well in a way I actually rooted for him more than the main protagonist. His motivations are very compelling and his background is tragic which makes you care for him more than any other character in the movie. If there is one thing the Oscars should have nominated from this movie it is Michael B Jordan for Best actor in supporting role. He did an amazing job it certainly deserved Academy attention. That would be the only Oscar nomination I actually can understand.As many point out the big problem in the movie is the special effects. I was very surprised to see this film was nominated for Best Visual effects since especially in the third act it was pretty clear it was shot entirely in a green screen. As much as I liked Killmonger I thought he should have been developed over a longer period of time. Until the third act he is just a random guy blowing things up and if they were developing the villain's background and motives I think Killmonger could have been way compelling than he was in the movie. It felt like the screen writers jammed in Killmonger's background story in the very last minute because they were too lazy writing a character arc from the start to the finish of the movie. But that doesn't take away the fact that Killmonger is a very good villain though he deserved to be developed over a longer period of time. The humor kind of felt forced a bit compared to other MCU films, but come on! There still is some very hilarious moments.Overall this is a movie that is very good but still pretty overhyped. Inside all of the Best Picture nominated films of 2019 this is the one I do not understand at all. It was a enjoyable enough movie but Best Picture out of all the great films that came out this year is pretty bizarre. Even Vice, a movie I gave a lower score than this I think had something that stood out, but Black Panther was just another standalone superhero film with nothing that was outstandingly good. Mark my word this is another distinct and unique movie inside the superhero genre, but if that's the case shouldn't the Oscars nominate every single movie inside the MCU where diversity in genres exist? The big reason why this movie is nominated according to critics is because this movie is lead entirely by people of color, but I think that is a pretty disgusting way to discuss film. It feels like the MCU producers went to the Academy asking them to nominate one of their films, and the Academy decided to nominate Black Panther solely because that was the only movie that followed their American leftist agenda. But I still think this is a movie that has more positive than negative aspects. As I said over and over Michael B Jordan gave a amazing performance as Killmonger and it is a performance that is the best ever since Heath Ledger's Joker. The Academy should have taken away all of the 7 nominations just to only give out the nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Michael B Jordan. Though I initially gave this a 7/10 I am pretty confident this will turn into a 8/10. Yes this is not Oscar worthy, but this deserves a higher rating than all of the 7/10 popcorn entertainment movies out there.",8,2,6,16 June 2019
The Matrix," üëçOne of the greatest action movies ever made.
","The Matrix is one of the best movies ever made, and I don't know how you can hate this masterpiece. It is near perfect in every way with beautifully choreographed action sequences and explores a really deep philosophical theme. It introduces us to this new idea that actually reality is not reality, which no other films in the past has ever touched or explored. To be honest, after watching this theme, I was obviously awed by the excellent choreography and visuals, but began doubting what is reality (LOL).Anyways, The Matrix is not only the best action movie ever made, but one of the best movies ever made. It is not simply just a movie, but is a piece of art. I don't even hate the two sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. I would like to strongly recommend this film to whoever it is reading my review, especially if you are a teenager and don't watch a whole ton of movies. I do understand you might not be interested in movies and rather play games, but you must see this at least once before you die, and I promise you will never regret watching.",10,3,4,20 November 2018
Green Book," üëç (Oscar 2019 reviews #1) A instant Christmas classic you must have on your Blue Ray shelf.
","Green Book is officially this year's winner of the Best Picture prize in the 90th Academy Awards. When I checked the winners online and saw this, I was very surprised. This movie was relatively less well received compared to the other movies (though it is certified fresh with a 78% on RT) so that might have been part of the surprise, but the biggest surprise was the movie it beat; Roma. Count me in as one of the people who were mad that Roma was snubbed. However, after watching this last night my perspective on this whole movie changed. Now this without question is my favorite among the Best Picture nominees this year.As many point out, the acting in this movie is fantastic. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have great charisma and chemistry on screen making their characters very likable. It is the type of performance you just can't forget and want to see again. The reason why this can be a feel good movie is because of their performances and how the characters were designed in a way we can care for, so definitely the acting deserved Oscar recognition.The looks of the film in general is very good and as they say in the movie you will be 'knocked out by how beautiful this country is.' As you can assume from the set up with a white driver driving a black pianist to the deep south, this film heavily focuses on segregation. But what this film does really well is it never gets off track. Instead of trying to be politically correct and preach political correctness to the audience, Green Book takes it's segregation to it's advantage to deepen the friendship of out 2 leads. I was very pleased to see a heart warming tale about friendship instead of a # Black Lives Matter propaganda. However, this doesn't mean the movie ignores all the important politics of this modern world. A quote that stoop out to me was the quote by Dr. Shirley 'If I'm not black enough and If I'm not black enough, tell me exactly who am I ?' In this era where political injection to a certain race is common (eg. if you are black, you need to be liberal), this quote personally reminded me that we should judge people not by race but actually who they are. While not being preachy on political correctness, I think this movie became a important reminder on our modern political climate at the same time. All politics aside this is just a movie that makes you feel so good, and who knew this was a Christmas movie? I am not going to spoil it, but as soon as you finish the movie I can guarantee you will go buy this on blue ray and watch it every Christmas with your family.As wonderful as this movie is and how much I want to give this a 10/10, there are some issues I need to point out. Though this is not a boring film at all it does some times feel a bit repetitive. The entire second act though it did a very good job building the friendship of the 2 leads felt like a repetition of this: Doc gets in trouble, Tony saves him, Doc teaches him how to write letters. Also the music kind of seemed to be over used a bit too much though the performance scenes were all very good. But the second act is still very good and though it is a bit repetitive you will never get bored. These are very minor issues compared to the positive aspects which definitely out weight the negative.Overall this is a fantastic movie that will probably be on my blue ray shelf by tomorrow. I think this will be a instant Christmas classic where every family will watch it on Christmas eve as soon as their children turn 13. Though Roma (which I gave a very positive review) might be a better movie if I was to rank all the Best Picture nominees, I think Green Book would hands down be my personal favorite and the one I will re watch the most. I rate it a 9/10 and I suggest you don't just watch it but buy it.",9,0,2,12 June 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," üëçThe best entry inside this franchise.
","In my opinion, this is the third and the best Indiana Jones movie, and the one of my favourite movies of all time. The Last Cursade is like Raiders of the Lost Ark. It has the archeology and adventure fun and fast tempo storytelling like Raiders of the Lost Ark, but there is one difference: it is greater.While following a similar format as Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Last Cursade adds more action sequences, more humour, more greater scale, more fun characters, more emotion, more character development, more backstory, and countless other elements that makes a sequel great, even greater than the original. The chemistry with Indiana Jones and his father Henry is great, there are many laughs, and the chases are more grand and more greater than the original.This could have been a perfect ending to this incredible film series, the phrase 'ending with a bang' will be actually appropriate. We of course know what happened with the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull crap, but overall, this is a great, fun movie which is the best of the Indiana Jones movies and one of my personal favourites. I strongly recommend this movie to those who haven't watched it.",10,2,3,15 December 2018
The Wizard of Oz," √∞≈∏‚Äò≈ΩCharming, but not aged that well.
","Many critics and audience label The Wizard of Oz as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history. It is in the top 250 in IMDb, has a 100% critic rating in meta critic, and in rotten tomatoes it is considered the best movie ever made. I do agree that this is a classic and it is a 'masterpiece', but it seems to me that this movie has not aged that well. Watching this now I feel like the special effects are really unrealistic and the acting is not horrible, but mediocre. Many critics and audiences talk about the 'magic' this film has, but I sadly was not able to understand what the 'magic' of this film is. To be honest I felt like watching a play being caught in video rather than watching an actual movie, and it doesn't have anything that uniquely distinguishes it from the original story by Frank Baum. I am not saying by any means that this movie is a cinematic failure or anything, and it might have had the 'magic' back in 1939. But watching it now, it feels so outdated, and like I said too mediocre. I would watch it for instance if I was bored and they were showing this film on Disney channel or something, but it is just not worth saving some time to watch it.",5,4,9,29 November 2018
