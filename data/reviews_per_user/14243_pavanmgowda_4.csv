The Hangover," Funny?
","Seriously, in what sense is this movie funny?
I watched the whole movie with the face of a serious killer. I thought I found a good trilogy, but darn it, I'm not planning on taking it further than this one.Las Vegas...blah,blah,blah!We need good movies Hollywood, please!",2,1,4,25 December 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Okayish, I guess?
","I didn't like this movie, also I didn't feel like I wasted my time. I guess that's alright sometimes. The four stars are mainly for the cast. Jennifer was absolutely gorgeous. Bradly Cooper was good. The story line felt somewhat flat to me. Except for big words being thrown once in a while I didn't really find anything catchy.",4,0,4,27 December 2018
How to Train Your Dragon 2," This... is Berk!
","You know, this movie was just as good as it's prequel. I was afraid this would be a let down, but thank God. I'm looking forward for the next part.",10,4,4,23 December 2018
How to Train Your Dragon," Who knew I was in for a great ride!
","I was bored and I wanted some light hearted fun movie to watch before I went to bed. What's better than an animated children's movie, right? So I counted on the IMDb's rating and picked this one. I'm so glad I did. This turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Now I'm only waiting to get bored once more to watch it's sequel. The dialogues were amazing. So many subtle jokes to grasp. I loved every bit of it. I hope the sequel stands up for this in every aspect. Also I loved the characters a lot. Very simple, straightforward personalities.",10,1,1,22 December 2018
