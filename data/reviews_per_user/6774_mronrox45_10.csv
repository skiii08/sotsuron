The New World," Love and Hate
","I really liked this movie a lot. First off, this is an 'art-house movie'. Most movies done like this are rarely given a blockbuster size budget to make, but this one did. All the performances are excellent, the cinematography is astounding, and although it may seem a bit slow at times, its perfect. Yes, there probably was some historical inaccuracies. But with all the mystery surrounding the relationship between Capt. Smith and ole' Poky, its a perfect opportunity for an interpreted story. I've seen this movie on two separate occasions, sober...and high. When I was high this movie made me cry...it did.",10,0,1,19 July 2017
The Longest Yard," There is one difference between old and new..
","There is one difference between old and new, Adam Sandler. The Waterboy was funny, the excited Southerner (if your an Adam Sandler fan) is funny, but The Longest Yard is just another brick in the wall. Adam Sandler had made a point to insult three groups of people in his long career. He really needs to get help with his dislike of Southerners, people with money and ALL people with Irish names. Did he get beat up every day by rich, southern Irish people? Must have, because he HATES them! As for the movie, if your an Adam Sandler fan then you will probably like it. If you liked the Waterboy and the Wedding Singer then you have already experienced the humor thats in this movie. Not to mention, if you've seen the old one, you've already seen this one too.",1,2,4,8 July 2012
Elf," Buddy is part of whats great about Christmas!!!
","This film is one for the whole family. I love Christmas and Christmas movies and this one is one of my top five. Buddy is perfect. He loves Christmas and everything about it. The story of how he becomes an ELF is almost believable unlike his SNL buddy Adam Sandler, who's movies are about as dumb and 'unbelieveable' as anything on the screen today. Last movie I went to see of his, I actually felt stupid as I left the theater. Anyway, Bob Newhart is great (as always) as Papa Elf. And the girl is as cute as a button. By the way, I love 'Its a Wonderful Life'. But I think I might be the only person who likes it and also likes 'Elf' and 'A Christmas Story'. Almost everyone who left a review that 'hates' both these movies suggests watching Its A Wonderful Life instead. Im assuming they are in the 80-200 year old bracket. Enjoy the movie, its great! But if your an old 'crabby-patty', don't bother.",10,0,1,15 January 2012
Empire of the Sun," A modern classic
","This is one of my all time favorite movies. There something about the idea of the story thats so appealing. Most stories about WWII are about battles. However, the two greatest movies about WWII, Casablanca and Empire of the Sun, go deeper into the personal trails of characters during a time when emotions and feelings were supposed to be on the back burner. The main character in this film is superb in showing what patriotism is all about. Hes English but has never been there and understands the Chinese (where he lives and grew up) better than his own people. Its a tale of the War that slipped through the cracks and never got told, the English that were trapped in China during WWII. I can see how this can be a little dry for some viewers but if you understand that this is a character study versus an action film it is a little easier to enjoy. Also, its strongly based on a true story with events that are spot on accurate. It is in my humble opinion the greatest 'coming of age' movie ever made. Besides, when the producers of this movie are Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and Robert Shapiro its a little hard to think this movie is a 'miss'. I don't think there is another movie in Hollywood that has ever had that powerful assembly of Producers, ever.",10,3,7,28 June 2012
Knowing," Brilliant...
","This was another movie that kinda slipped under the radar with me. Me and my son went to see it one day when we had nothing better to do at the dollar theaters. First off, if your an M. Night fan you will love this movie. If your not, there a chance you will be disappointed as the ending takes a 90 degree turn from where the movie was headed. As a Christian, I found many parallels to Biblical teachings and it opened my mind a bit. It can also help others who are not Creationists understand what we believe. Acting was solid, cinematography was good, storyline was excellent. Special effects are great, not over the top but enough to let you know this is not a low budget flick. For those who 'hated' this movie, (I never understand how someone can hate a movie, its just too powerful a word for a movie!)I have to wonder how you cannot be a little impressed with this movies imagination. I cant help but think your just a bunch of bitter kids who haven't had to sit through enough truly boring movies like I have. A MUST SEE! ENJOY!!",10,2,8,14 August 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: An Unnecessary long film
","This movie was really disappointing. Let me say that although I didn't read the LOTR books, I loved the movies. However, I did read The Hobbit. Just got back from the theaters a few hours ago so I've had a few hours to think about what I liked and didn't like. First off, one hour into the movie I found myself getting sleepy and closing my eyes for a few minutes (I have never done that). I thought, 'maybe Im just exhausted from Christmas' but after the movie my Mom, cousins and uncle all said they did the same thing! We actually got a little laugh about it as it was the only reason we could find to smile after seeing the movie. It just took too long for 'the adventure' to get started, and there was little reason to understand WHY Bilbo changed his mind and decided to go! Second, Im done with IMAX,3D movies that are set in dark locations like this movie. Its physically too hard to follow the action and I find myself exhausted trying to keep up with 'whos getting killed' or 'who lived'. Speaking of getting killed, NOBODY DID! About half way through the adventure it just started to get ridiculous how these puny dwarfs were surviving everything they were going through. I know its a fantasy movie, but gimmie a break! By the end I knew everyone was going to live through everything, making the battle scenes very boring. Bilbo had to be the most disappointing character in this movie. The book was written through his eyes and it made you sympathize with his struggles. I had ZERO sympathy for Bilbo! I almost feel guilty saying that as I almost cried watching the cartoon when I was a kid! Lastly,(and I might be the only person who didn't know this going in) when the movie ended I got a real sickening felling deep inside. The Hobbit was ONE short book! Why are they trying to make it into 3 very long movies!! All of a sudden I realized I had been duped. Duped into a typical Hollywood money-grab riding on the coat-tails of LOTR. At that point I realized why this movie was so bad. Its just trying to be something it is not. If this movie was made as a one movie blockbuster it would have been great. John Carter could have done the same thing but instead, the writers put all the books into one movie and it turned out great. This is the exact opposite. Parts 2 and 3 of this story will be seen by me at the dollar theater. If your a die-hard fan and find that you 'must' see this at the theater, that is my advice to you as well.",1,50,95,26 December 2012
Total Recall," Best Aw-nuld movie all time!
","Had to come here and leave a review, seeing how I just watched the new Total Recall and thought I was going to puke! There were plenty of things about this version that could have been better but after seeing the new one I have to say it was just right. The new Total Recall is completely devoid of any humor, terrible soundtrack, and too much action. I would expect a re-make to take whats good from the original and try to improve upon it. But instead, they included the few cheesy scenes from the original and dumped everything that made the original great. The violence is this version could have been toned down as at many times it seems more than just excessive. I've heard that the original cut was so excessive that it was given an 'X' rating for violence. Is that possible? Anyhow, if you haven't seen either one, don't bother with the new one. That is unless your under the age of 15. Not to mention they made the women in this version tough, but not too tough that it was not believable. The new version is just ridiculous. Skinny, supermodel types like Kate Beckinsale don't go around kicking the crap out of men twice their size. The new 'Wonder Woman' powers that modern movies give to women is just silly and makes a lot of people in the theater feel a little uncomfortable.",9,0,4,22 December 2012
The Da Vinci Code," The new way to teach The Bible
","I rated this movie far higher than I felt it deserved just to keep people on their toes. What this movie portrays is the simple evolution to our current society - EVERYTHING IS A CONSPIRACY!! JFK was a good movie to most that saw it but later was disliked after they found that most of the facts were put together to make the movie more compelling than the facts stated. Same with this movie. Its really getting to be a tired genre, but it keeps the idiots filing through the theater doors. Not to mention it has become the most favorite genre of the occupy wall street crowd. Whats sad about this is there are real conspiracies out there but they are usually on the other side of the isle. BE WARNED MOVIE GOERS! THE TRUTH IS NOT IN HERE!",1,4,6,19 October 2011
Prometheus," A good start to a new set of 'Alien' movies
","I was really impressed with the direction and subtle approach to the origins of the 'Alien' franchise. David is the best 'android' yet. The 'invitation' seemed a bit of a stretch seeing how there are no cave paintings at all of early man worshiping stars and large beings. Would have liked for Scott to have used something more historically real. No big deal, I just like being titillated by a little history that somehow connects our future. I like Scotts approach to fate. Its so much more mature for a director who respects the fact the more than 80% of the planet believes in some form of Diety. Its nice to see someone in Hollywood respecting people of this planet as opposed to mocking them. It obvious from the people who 'hate' this film, there is a large portion who dislike it based on the 'faith' premise. I understand not believing in a God, I was one myself for 30 years. But the new batch of anti-Christians (they are really anti-Creationist, but as most only seem to criticize Christianity, that what I call them) just flat out cant handle any kind of mention of faith at all. Its sad really, don't we all deserve respect for what we believe? This movie does a good job expressing that respect.",10,15,27,6 January 2013
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Still a classic to this day!!
","The only sad thing about The Holy Grail is that they didn't make another one! Sadly, I see that there are many reviews that are 1 star. I just don't get it. Or maybe, they didn't get it. Several reviews remarked that 'it looked cheap', or it was 'silly', and that there was 'poor acting'. The only thing I can figure is that these reviewers must be under the age of 13, or at least have the IQ of someone under thirteen. You do need to have studied a bit of English history or at least watched one of the many King Arthur movies made in the past 50 years. Do high school kids read the Canterbury Tales anymore? But if you're under 12 or limit your movie watching to 'kick in the crotch' comedy, this might be a little over your head. What are kids learning about in History nowadays? I only ask because neither my 17 year old nephew or any of his friends found this movie funny. They just stared at it like they didn't understand WHY it was funny! Maybe the dumbing down of our education system is really happening after all. Anyway, if you know anything about the story of King Arthur then you will find this movie extremely funny!",10,3,4,3 May 2016
