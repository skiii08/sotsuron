The Legend of Bagger Vance," Redford at the top of his game
","Because Robert Redford has become the symbol of filmmaking in America--having won an Oscar in his directorial debut for 'Ordinary People,' then founding the Sundance Institute and Sundance Film Festival--his work tends to be scrutinized more than most. We watch each frame of his films just to see if he'll slip up. As evidenced by his latest, 'The Legend of Bagger Vance,' Mr. Redford is a filmmaker of scientific precision. He was in a zone when he made this one.Going in I wasn't all that intrigued by the story: a once-great golf pro tries to regain his game against two of the world's best golfers. As you'd expect, golf here is a metaphor for life. I hung on every word of Bagger Vance's philosophical speeches to Rannulph Junuh (dig the genuine 1920's names) about how to find, say, the perfect shot or the perfect swing. I have no idea why because the game itself bores me. I was simply there because when a Redford-directed film unspools, I've learned by now that I should be in the audience. The man just knows how to pull you in.The story is set in Savannah, Georgia, where golf is bigger than football in Texas. The Great Depression has just hit. Adele Invegordon (Charlize Theron) has just inherited her father's fortune--which includes the golf course he'd just finished--after the man's suicide. The golf club and resort is worth little now and she's approached by some local men about selling. She believes she can bolster its value and has the idea to hold a tournament on the course between the country's two best golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. Savannah is thought of as the golf capitol of the world so its people insist on one of their own playing in the tourney. A local boy, Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), a dedicated fan of Savannah legend Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) who hasn't been seen since leaving to serve in the Great War, promises a town hall filled with the city's elite that he can produce the missing golf pro--and does. It just so happens that Adele was Junuh's lover before the war.The idea isn't that interesting but Redford's gift is making his chosen material engaging. Junuh is persuaded, going against his better judgment, to compete against Jones and Hagen. Problem is, he's 'lost his swing.' Enter Bagger Vance. Vance (Will Smith) is like a figment of Junuh's or Hardy's imagination. Like Shoeless Joe Jackson in 'Field of Dreams' ('Vance' has the same sort of mystical, magical feel of that film), he's a ghost--only everyone can see him. He offers his services as Junuh's caddy but isn't satisfied with just carrying and selecting clubs. In fact, he rarely even does what a caddy is supposed to do (which creates many of the film's humorous moments). Vance has a different fight to help Junuh win--the battle of the soul.The tournament itself takes up most of the film and it is, needless to say, executed to perfection. It has all the intensity of a great sports film plus all the deliberateness and beauty of a Redford film. 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is certainly one of the best, if not the best, films of the year. It's been a weak year for the industry so that isn't saying much. This just makes work of true quality easier to spot.Grade: A",10,0,1,14 November 2000
Erin Brockovich," Care until it hurts
","Think about the person in your life who's a thorn in your side, that annoying person who knows exactly where your buttons are and when to push them; that person who, no matter how hard you try to refute their words, you have to admit `you're right' on a regular basis.  This person isn't perfect--they too have their weaknesses, their flaws, but whenever you try to throw these flaws in their face, they come up with something even more incriminating about you to throw back.  You hate this person and love them dearly at the same time, because without them, you'd probably be in a gutter somewhere. That person you are thinking of is your 'Erin Brockovich.'  If you see the highly entertaining new Steven Soderbergh film named for her, you'll see my point.Hollywood does love the underdog.  When we're introduced to our heroine, played to perfection by Julia Roberts, she has no money, no job, and no marketable skills with which to get one.  Here we see the frustration anyone encounters when looking for a job: `If only they would just give me a chance, I'd show them...'  Personality goes a long way, but isn't enough to land a job, even an entry-level one.  Personality's something Erin's got a bit too much of, unfortunately.  Her life so far has been one long disappointment and frustration and desperation has its way of creeping to the surface.One of the amazing things about Erin is that even when she's hanging onto the thinnest of threads, she never backs down.  For instance, she finally lands a job from her lawyer, Ed Masry (played by the brilliantly-cast Albert Finney), who takes pity on her because he lost her neck injury lawsuit.  Her wardrobe is limited to bright-colored, revealing tops and short skirts.  Ed starts to give her the standard `workplace attire' speech after she's been there a while.  She plainly refuses to change her wardrobe, citing `I think I look good' in her defense.  The way she says it leaves no room for argument, no room to question.  Suddenly, her wardrobe makes all the sense in the world!  Then comes the PG&E lawsuit.  After Erin reveals her findings to one family who have all become sick in one form or another, many other families begin to come forward.  Masry now has a very large civil case on his hands, and continually denies he has the resources to handle it.  Erin, of course, believes otherwise.  The case will require a ton of research, thousands of signatures, costly expert witnesses.  All Ed sees is money piling up that may never be repaid.  Erin sees people who have been wronged and lied to. She makes her argument and, again, it makes all the sense in the world. 'Erin Brockovich' is about the power of giving a damn.  Erin cares so much it hurts.  She knows each face, age, disease, phone number, and address of the people she's fighting for.  The film tells you that this kind of compassion is something that no law school can ever teach.  She's smart, she cares, and she's willing to fight.  That's all she needs.It's good to see that life under the guidance of a big studio hasn't cramped Mr. Soderbergh's style, at least not too much.  Handheld camera is used almost exclusively, which makes you feel like it's really happening, like you're right there watching it.  This is a simple story and he tells it straight, rarely dipping into his usual bag of tricks.  For my money, Mr. Soderbergh is the best, most vital director working in Hollywood right now. I'm glad he was hired to make 'Brockovich,' but have to admit I'd like to see him return to the less conventional style of his other recent work, 'Out of Sight' and 'The Limey,' two of the best films of the nineties.Grade: B",9,1,1,26 March 2000
Meet the Parents," poor Focker
","Throughout the film, even at the end, I felt like imploring the guy, 'run for your life! She's not the one!' Pam's neglect of Greg's feelings and most of all her blindness toward her father's obsessiveness demonstrates how we never see our own family the same way other people do. You know your family is weird--but just how weird is only found through throwing a stranger at its mercy.'Parents' begins as an overprotective-father-versus-boyfriend story, moves toward the ridiculous, but always remains believable. After a while it becomes clear that the real problem between Greg and Jack (Robert DiNiro), Pam's dad, is simple: they just don't get along. We've all come across people we know we don't like from the moment we meet them. Greg's tough luck is that his father-in-law to-be is one of these people.'Meet The Parents' is good because it gives each character enough of a life that each has something to learn. It's also got a lot of humanity at its core. Most everyone who sees this film will be able to relate to Greg's predicament. Most everyone will recall a time when they were in Greg's shoes--or they'll come to the shocking realization that they were torturing someone and didn't know it at the time.This is a rare story in which there really is one main character around which everything else revolves. Everything that happens is connected with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller plays it perfectly; he's never been funnier). There are no unnecessary subplots that enhance supporting characters. They don't even bother giving Pam her own life. All she is, from first frame to last, is Greg's girlfriend. Jack is Greg's girlfriend's dad and so on. This puts you inside the main character's world in a way few films do.While the writers show great control over their material by doing this, they fall short in other areas. Greg's last name, Focker, and the various ways people pronounce it, is a running gag that isn't nearly as funny as the film's creators seem to think it is. Whenever things start getting dull, they pull out the old Focker joke so at least the small-minded people in the audience can get a giggle. There are moments of agony, such as truck tires spraying sewage all over Pam's family, that are so gross you can't believe what you're watching. The goal is to set this lewdness against a backdrop of suburban normalness, which makes it funnier.Supposedly anyway. More times than not, though, it works. The film does what all good entertainment does: holds a warped mirror up to real life, so we can laugh at ourselves a little.Grade: C+",6,0,0,23 October 2000
Unbreakable," shyamalan got me again
","That this is the second straight collaboration between writer/director Shyamalan and Bruce Willis isn't as interesting to me as this: `Unbreakable' is the third film starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The three films and six roles played couldn't be more different.The first is of course, `Pulp Fiction,' a film that launched Jackson to superstardom and re-ignited Willis' career. They play two of the film's main characters, a boxer in a rigged fight and a hit-man who finds spirituality. They have one scene together but even then they never say a word to each other. The two characters have a strange connection though. It's one of those between-the-lines kinds of things that you only notice if you've seen a film as many times as I've seen `PF.' Both performances are arguably their best.Next is `Die Hard With a Vengeance,' which cast Willis as New York cop John McClain again, with Jackson as his reluctant sidekick, Zues. I like the movie but I can never figure out quite why Jackson's character is there other than to give McClain someone to talk to. Nevertheless, the two are in most of their scenes together. For some reason the franchise turns its back on the whole one-man-against-an-army concept of the first two films and turns the third into a buddy movie.Five years later, both men's careers are still sizzling. `Unbreakable' will do nothing to hurt either. I never once thought of Jules Winfield or Butch Coolidge, John McClain or Zeus Carver. Again, the two play completely different characters from any they've played before. Willis plays David Dunn, a guy who can't remember the last time he was sick, broke a bone, or even got a paper cut. He's just survived a train wreck that no one else survived. Not only that, he walked away without a scratch. Jackson plays Elijah Price, a man who would seem to be David's exact opposite. Elijah has a degenerative bone disease that makes them very brittle and easy to break. Elijah has a few hobbies. One is collecting rare comic book art and studying it. Another is finding his exact opposite. He believes that if someone like him can exist, someone who breaks very easily, then why shouldn't someone exist who can't be broken?Let's get one thing out of the way before I go on: Shyamalan is a genius. To have conceived, written and pulled a project the caliber of `Unbreakable' together in the short time between completing `Sixth Sense' and now is incredible. No sophomore slump here. `Unbreakable' will stick to your bones like turkey and mashed potatoes.Unlike `Sixth Sense,' the director takes a few minor missteps here. These are technical faults that can be attributed to having to work on more of a deadline than the last time. Just because his last film was perfect doesn't mean he's infallible. It isn't perfect, but `Unbreakable' is definitely a success.Anyone who saw `Sixth Sense' will recognize Shyamalan's filmmaking style here. The pacing is the same. He again unfolds the story slowly. `Unbreakable' doesn't build to quite the crescendo that `SS' does, but you can see an unmistakably similar formula at work. Each auteur has his/her own.Shyamalan's gift seems to be laying out the clues for those perceptive enough to see them. If you just sit back and enjoy, you'll be surprised at the end. Your jaw will hit the floor with almost as much velocity as it did in `SS.' The more perceptive though, will pick up on the clues and won't be fooled. I was fooled. Again. But that's what makes it so much fun.Grade: A-",9,1,1,1 December 2000
Chicken Run," Run (TO the theater)!
","Remember those old Christmas movies that used stop-motion animation, like 'The Year Without a Santa Claus' (you know, the one with Heat Miser and Snow Miser). In a way, that kind of animation was more fun because it has such a personal touch. Each frame requires a human hand to make a change. Digital animators are brilliant, true, but let's face it: isn't digital all about making animation easier? There is a programmer and then a computer that does the actual work. Companies like Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic have made great strides, but a film like 'Chicken Run' shows you that the Old School still has a few tricks up its sleeve. Just consider that they've made a big, spectacular, blockbuster film--in the year 2000--with Claymation!This film was made for kids, so they keep the story simple. It opens with the chickens of Mrs. Tweedy's chicken farm trying in vain to escape. At first it looks to be a remake of Wilder's 'Stalag 17,' only with poultry. With the fence and the rows and rows of shacks, it's really just like a POW camp. After the opening sequence, though, there are many references to other classic films, many of them Speilberg (coincidence?), but the story carves (pun?) out a life of its own. There is an outsider who has a secret, kind of like 'Stalag 17,' but here it's an American (the film's set in England) rooster named Rocky that crash-lands inside the camp. He's one of only a few men in the camp (it's an egg farm) and becomes an instant celebrity. The organizer of the escape plans, Ginger, suggests he teach them all to fly just as soon as his wounded wing heals. Problem is, Mrs. Tweedy is building a pie-making machine designed to mass-produce chicken pot-pies and time is running out.The film is genuinely funny. I never had to laugh at anything in it out of courtesy. Not every joke flies, but you will howl more than a few times.Every once in a while, there needs to be a stop-motion or Claymation feature to remind us that you don't need a computer necessarily to bring the imagination to life. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach' come to mind as other recent examples. Both stop-motion and Claymation have one important characteristic in common: the need to be photographed. In my opinion, there will never be a time when the human eye can truly be fooled by the ultra-real images created by a computer. One method digital animators use to make their characters more real-looking is the use of light and shadow. If you look close enough at, say, the dinosaurs in 'Jurassic Park' (Spielberg again), you know it's not real shadows you're seeing across the back of that T-Rex. Like everything else on its body, a computer paints those shadows. With stop-motion, the animators can really light their images, using the full spectrum of colors, light, and dark that film stock offers, not to mention panning and trucking, split focus images, and other conventional film techniques. It just looks more, well, welcoming.In closing, before I spoil the fun, be in a hurry to see 'Chicken Run.'Grade: A",10,3,3,15 July 2000
X-Men," Should be the biggest movie of the summer
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It should satisfy the passive fan (me) and the fanatic. A note to said fanatics: if you want a truly pure adaptation of a comic this complex, you're talking about a five-hour film that costs 200 million dollars or more. The filmmakers have retained the most vital aspect of the comic: its spirit.Going in I was concerned that, with so many complex characters to introduce and get to know, the film's creators would have trouble fitting it all in and not sacrifice story. Fortunately, Bryan Singer and writer David Hayter understood that, even though this is a team of super heroes, there would need to be a central character or two that are the story's focus. Even better, they choose perhaps the two most interesting X-Men to build the story around: Wolverine and Rogue.It's no wonder that Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine, is one of the most popular characters ever drawn in a comic book. For one thing, the foot-long claws made of an indestructible metal (called adamantium) that shoot out of his knuckles (SNIKT!) that he has trouble controlling at times. Along with the claws, his entire skeleton is laced with the same adamantium. Much of his life is a mystery to him--he doesn't remember how the metal got there, nor even where or when he was born. And I haven't even gotten to what his real super power is: he heals really fast (but still feels pain) and has the heightened senses and reflexes of a wild animal. For my money, perhaps the coolest comic book character ever created. Like the other mutants of the X-Men, his powers are both a blessing and a curse. The claws and metal-laced bones come in handy when he gets into a tussle, but they also leave him at the mercy of the X-Men's archenemy Magneto, who controls all metals.In the film, Rogue (Anna Paquin), a teen who has just discovered that she is a mutant, runs away from home and ends up in western Canada, where she comes across Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). This struck me as a huge coincidence, the kind that only a movie can get away with. But then it occurred to me that Professor X (played by Patrick Stewart), the X-Men's leader, may have placed a hypnotic suggestion in Rogue's mind to go to the Canadian Rockies, to the exact town Wolverine was in. I figure this because, in the film's first big action sequence, the two of them run across some bad mutants, Sabretooth and Toad, and are rescued by two of Professor X's students, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Storm (Halle Berry). I suppose the writer thought we'd figure all this out for ourselves. While all the other mutants in Charles Xavier's school have powers that are useful, Rogue's seem at first only a curse: any person she touches, she absorbs their life force, plus their personality traits and super powers, if any. This leaves the person she touches weakened and, depending on how long the contact lasts, comatose or dead. The prospect of a life without the possibility of real human contact is unimaginable, especially for a teenager.As the story progresses, we find out that Magneto has plans for Rogue. Wolverine adopts her as sort of a big brother and swears to protect her. He has every reason to fear Magneto, but bravely faces up to him anyway ('Who laced your bones with that wonderful metal?' Magneto's question to Logan, is one of the weirdest lines you're likely to hear in a movie all year). Logan/Wolverine also finds himself siding with Magneto in a way, seeing that humanity is getting ready to wage war on their kind. This is consistent with the comic, and makes Logan difficult for the rest of the team to trust. Magneto (Ian McKellan-perfect casting), is in the process of recruiting mutants to join him in his planned counter-offensive against the rest of humanity. Driving the political steamroller against the mutants is U.S. Senator Robert Kelly, who believes, among other things, that mutant teens should be banned from public schools because they can be considered lethal weapons (a very timely issue to introduce). It's hard not to empathize with Magneto's view: he's seen what happens when a government turns against an entire race, having survived a Polish concentration camp in WWII (illustrated in the film's gripping opening scene). All signs point to a witch-hunt aimed at the mutants and he's not going to stand around and watch it happen. His plan doesn't even involve killing. He's not out for world domination, but merely wishes to change people's thinking. Xavier knows that bloodshed is inevitable, however, given Magneto's 'By Any Means Necessary' position.The film's not perfect. It's based on a comic, so it has to be campy at times. There's also a few story flaws. For instance, when Rogue runs away from Xavier's school for the gifted, Xavier needs to use a machine that enhances his psychic powers, called 'Cerebro,' to locate her, even though she's only a few blocks away at the train station. Cyclops and Storm are sent to find her and are again confronted with Sabretooth and Toad (a minor character in the comic, but causes major trouble for the X-Men here). Then Xavier gets the police involved, using them only as a shield and endangering their lives as a result. I'm pleased with this scene because it's almost as if the police aren't even there, just like the comic would do. The only scene where Xavier and Magneto really do battle, it's one of the film's best and most imaginative. Then Mystique, another Magneto loyalist, flies in and picks Magneto and company up in a helicopter. Why would a guy as powerful as Magneto need to escape in a helicopter? There's also a brief ode to 'Star Wars,' seemingly for the benefit of those who actually liked 'Episode I,' in which Ray Park, who plays Toad, strikes a Darth Maul pose. Tacky and unnecessary.Like the comic, Professor Xavier's team is still a work-in-progress, still learning how to work together and to use their own super powers. This vulnerability creates jeopardy and gives the franchise somewhere to go: over the course of the series (there will be several of these films, I'm sure), they'll master their powers and teach newcomers how to use theirs. The final scenes leave the door open for the inevitable next chapter, for which I will wait with bated breath.Grade: B",8,0,0,17 July 2000
The Beach," Bad choice for Leo
","Leonardo DiCaprio's brilliant work in Titanic (though not his best) and the unexpected explosion of popularity that ensued, opened wide the floodgates of his career. He now earns a Tom Cruise-sized paycheck for any old project he chooses to attach himself to. We all hoped he would choose his projects wisely (from what I have heard about American Psycho, he was wise to turn it down).If hindsight were 20/20, one could argue for his passing on The Beach as well, the film adaptation of wonder boy Alex Garland's novel, which I have not read. The source material notwithstanding, this is a grim tale that goes everywhere you don't expect. Usually this would be a good thing, but this project meanders endlessly as we take a trip through the slowly fragmenting mind of Richard (Leo), an adventurous twentysomething just looking for a little excitement in his life.Richard's journey begins in Thailand, where he stays in the world's worst motel and ends up living next to Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking psychotic raving about a hidden beach on an island paradise. Because Richard doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life and he's real bored, he buys the story, takes Daffy's map, and sets out to find the island. He even finds two more suckers willing to be stupid with him, the lovely Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet), French lovers traveling together (but of course, it's Leo and poor Etienne never stands a chance).When they finally find the island, the film becomes a bit humorous (intentionally, I think) as we meet its inhabitants, basically a bohemian mini-culture living in complete seclusion from the world, calling themselves Parallel Universe. The group's founder, chairperson, and den mother, Sal (Tilda Swinton), is obsessively protective of their culture. The fun ends like it always does, and the film gets increasingly trippy, ugly, and violent: In a word, `disturbing.'In the end we're supposed to realize that paradise is something to be earned, not claimed: You can run from the world, but eventually it will find you. One humorous scene features the members of the group, one by one, giving Richard their long lists of items needed from civilization. He and Sal (who naturally can't resist Leo's charms either) are to make a trip back into Thailand (for extra rice or something). It occurs to you, even as you're watching this scene, that the crew and passengers of the U.S.S. Minnow were so much cooler and more resourceful than these losers!
Beach, of course, was made by the writing/directing team who brought us the far superior Trainspotting, John Hodge and Danny Boyle. Their creative stamp is most definitely visible here and they do create some memorable visual imagery. This is due in large part to the masterful photography by the distinguished, versatile Darius Khondji, the man responsible for Se7en, Delicatessen, City of Lost Children, and Evita. I can't recommend The Beach, but I'd still run out and see the next Boyle/Hodge collaboration. Come to think of it, I've seen every one of them since 1994's Shallow Grave.Grade: D+",3,1,2,1 March 2000
Cast Away," The return of the silent film (sort of)
","Warning: this may contain spoilers.If you watch the current trailer for 'Cast Away,' you might go in expecting this Indiana Jones-style exotic action/adventure film. Dreamworks is selling something they're not delivering on, which is a mistake. No matter how good the film is, many viewers are going to feel duped. I didn't. Yes, it moved slower than I thought it would. That's only because I've come to expect differently from a major studio. Films that seem to have a lot at stake tend to worry too much about the audience feeling things like bored and impatient. The result is a rushed story that ends up disappointing anyway.'Cast Away' actually trusts its audience. That's why at the end I really felt like applauding. I'd just been shown something great and meaningful. Except, to my surprise, no one else clapped (I am by nature shy, so I let the opportunity pass). I can't say I blame anyone either. There is so much bad filmmaking out there and people see so many films, so when a film of true quality surfaces, people don't recognize it. Quality work is so rare, it becomes unfamiliar. What this means is that 'Cast Away' probably won't be a huge success, unfortunately. Why? Well, because it's (gulp) too good.I've read that the concept was Tom Hanks' idea, who produces and plays Chuck Noland, the film's subject. But the greatness of this movie really begins with its script, by William Broyles. I certainly hope enough people in the Academy will recognize this. Probably not, because it's not flashy. It doesn't contain a lot of great dialogue. It isn't really even that clever. But Broyles does the most difficult thing a writer has to do, which is, tell a story that doesn't need words. I'm waiting for the day a director makes a silent movie that a major distributor takes a chance on. The motion picture medium was created without spoken words in mind. 'Cast Away' could be a Christmas present to the hearing impaired. I believe they would see the exact same story as anyone else, with no subtitles.  The words Broyles does write are great. They do what they're supposed to do: stay out of the way.Many people who see this will wonder what happened to the score. There is one somewhere, but it doesn't show up very often. For good reason, director Robert Zemeckis (who's managed to make both one of the year's worst films, 'What Lies Beneath,' and one of the year's best), uses music sparingly. The lack of music, especially during the island portion of the film, is just as effective as the best John Williams composition would have been. For this entire island portion of the film, interrupted only briefly when Chuck sets sail on his raft of tree branches, all we hear are the natural sounds of the island and one man's voice.Hanks has already won two Oscars. Now he's grown even further as an actor. This is such a huge role. I mean, the guy IS the movie.  The odds of him not winning a third Oscar are slim (no pun intended). True, the most demanding portion of the role is spent talking to a volleyball named Wilson. This is one part of the film that really sticks with you, the image of a face painted in blood on a piece of sports equipment. For four-odd years, Chuck is able to keep his body alive through sheer human ingenuity. But it won't mean a thing if his mind doesn't survive as well. That's why he creates Wilson. Many viewers will think Chuck is going insane. On the contrary, it's merely survival. It may be the most powerful performance by an inanimate object ever.'Cast Away' makes you think about a lot of things. Chuck's life before he was stranded on the island was controlled by time and technology. He has so little time, he uses things like pagers and cell phones just to keep his relationships alive. He's also a trainer for Fed Ex so, as with most of today's professions, he relies heavily on the advances in technology that human beings have made. When we watch him find ways to survive upon being stranded and completely isolated, it's only then we see what a human being is truly capable of. THIS is how far we've come as a species. It's a not-so-subtle point the film makes very well.The most important thing that the film has to teach is so great. That thing is this: sometimes the only way to know what you're really living for is to have everything taken away. Only then will you know what you want returned to you. All Chuck wants back is his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt). When Chuck returns to find that the world has moved on without him, that the love of his life has moved on without him, the true test of survival begins. Chuck is now a phantom. He wonders if he even has a place in the world anymore. But how many of us feel that way without the benefit of being stranded on a tropical island alone for four years?And there it is. Extraordinary. (applause)Grade: A",10,0,0,3 January 2001
Pitch Black," best sci-fi of 2000
","'Pitch Black' kicks right off with a pretty spectacular scene. In this scene a spaceship serving as a sort of inter-galactic subway train crash lands on a strange planet.  Among the surviving passengers is a convicted mass murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel from 'Saving Private Ryan'), being transported back to prison or somewhere nasty.  There's the co-captain of the ship, Fry (Rahda Mitchell from 'High Art'), who finds herself in charge. There are about ten others to begin with, but that number of course is reduced to about four by the end.The planet is very desert-like (what world of your typical sci-fi movie isn't?) Luckily (by golly, what a coincidence!) they land near a settlement now seemingly abandoned. There's also a canyon nearby filled with the bones of alien creatures. The group sets out in search of water, concerned by the presence of Riddick. But then something else starts killing people. They discover that the planet's only remaining life forms are these nasty, hammerhead shark-looking things that fly. The planet has three suns and for some reason, these creatures can't live in sunlight. Day lasts 22 years. At night, they hunt. Thing is, night lasts maybe as long as the day (a very cool concept that put a grin on my face). Oh and wouldn't you know it, after almost 22 years of daylight, these poor people crash land on the planet only a few days before the long night falls. sucks to be you I guess.The film is actually the best sci-fi flick I've seen lately (which only demonstrates how bad the sci-fi has been this year). It's quite entertaining if you can get past how absurd it is. The trick is not to think too much when you're watching it. The script cleverly plays the personalities of the characters against each other. It plays the horror movie game of 'who's the real bad guy?' for the entire length of the film as well as another old favorite, 'who's going to die next?' If you just concentrate on these questions and not the story itself, which is full of holes, you'll have a good time at 'Pitch Black.'Grade: C+",6,0,0,10 January 2001
U-571," Rock the boat
","As I sat and waited for this movie to begin, I had to sit through a number of really bad trailers for really bad movies-except one: Director Wolfgang Petersen ('In The Line of Fire,' 'Air Force One') has a new film coming out June 30th called 'The Perfect Storm.' Petersen's come a long way, but his masterpiece is still 'Das Boot,' the epic German World War II submarine film that really set the standard for all underwater thrillers that followed.As if the trailer weren't reminder enough of Boot's influence on it, 'U-571' begins with none other than the crew of a German U-boat struggling against depth charges dropped by a British destroyer. Writer/director Jon Mostow is tipping his hat to Petersen here, given the way we're allowed to get to know these characters a little bit. These are not the inhuman, evil, cold-blooded Nazis depicted in American cinema, but simply a crew of men under orders, doing their duty, trying to survive. Of course, this is an American film and we're soon informed who we're supposed to be rooting for.
Mostow wasn't trying to make a better film than its predecessors, just a Bigger, Faster, and Louder one. He knows his limits: He doesn't have Denzel or Hackman. Or Connery. Or Baldwin. 'U-571' bravely charts its own course, happy to be something that neither 'Boot,' nor 'Hunt For Red October,' nor 'Crimson Tide' were: an all-out action flick. Mostow's crew consists of names like McConaughey, Keitel, Paxton, Bon Jovi, Weber. None of these guys (well, except maybe Keitel) is going to demand the big speech, the scenery-chewing dialogue. Their job is to say the lines they're given and look mean or intense or afraid-whatever the scene calls for. The film's one developed character, Matthew McConaughey's Lieutenant Andrew Tyler, provides enough to keep the boat, and the film, afloat.I'm not going to get into the details of the plot because it's really no better or worse than the plot of the other underwater thrill rides you've seen. I will say that it's set near the end of World War II, at which time Allied forces were trying to capture coding devices that made German naval communications undecipherable. Mostow's story has a few unexpected twists, with a script that often leads you astray of what will actually happen. It also seems designed, often at the expense of historical accuracy, to deliver as many opportunities for things to blow up as possible. In fact, it's been a while since I've seen or heard things blow up quite as well as they did in this film.Do try to see 'U-571' in a well-equipped theater, but make sure you take in its superior elder statesmen at some point.Grade: B-",7,0,2,29 April 2000
The Patriot," A mess of epic proportions
","'The Patriot' is the latest film about the ugliness of war. True, if it hadn't been for this brutal war for independence, there wouldn't be a Here. Had we not risen up against the British, where would we be now? Worse off? Better? Is that so unimaginable? 'I will not fight,' are Benjamin Martin's words (Mel Gibson) to the South Carolina Colonial legislature. He knows that any war with the British will be fought not in some far away place away from civilians, but in cities, in communities, in people's back yards. He holds that he and his seven children are just fine with the way things are. Or maybe he foresaw a future filled with Jerry Springers, Howard Sterns, Newt Gingriches, and Bill Clintons and decided it just wasn't worth it. If only everyone else had this kind of foresight.Despite Martin's urgings, war breaks out. Everything he feared soon becomes reality: the war spills over into his home. Imagine walking out into your back yard and watching hundreds of men in opposing lines, hundreds of rifles exploding in unison, cannons firing, blood splattering, heads flying. Freedom has a high price. The same kind of war against the innocent is being waged right now in other countries.When his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), is exposed as a dissident by the ruthless British General Tavington (Jason Isaacs) and taken away to be hanged, Martin hunts Gabriel's captors down and slaughters them (with the help of two of his surviving sons). Beneath Martin's gentle exterior is a savage warrior capable of laying waste to several men with nothing more than a hatchet. This was a well staged, well cut scene. From here, a vengeful Martin wages a one-man guerrilla war against the British to minimize the body count of his countrymen. Okay, well not quite. This is what is set up, but is not the direction the story takes. Martin's warrior rage never resurfaces. Instead, the story settles into a demonstration of how vengeance and bloodlust have no place in a war. Not that I'm disappointed--it's just that there's a difference between misdirecting the audience (for surprise) and misleading them. To put it more simply, pick a story.Benjamin Martin is portrayed as a man with an ugliness inside of him that he will do anything to keep in check. War tends to bring out this side of him and so as a result, he fears war. Once this side of him he keeps down, though, this unstoppable 'instrument of warfare' (to quote another Robert Rodat script, 'Saving Private Ryan'), is established, BECAUSE it's what the character doesn't want, the best thing for the story is for it to resurface. Didn't Mr. Rodat ever watch 'The Incredible Hulk' on TV? Or how about 'Unforgiven,' about as close to perfect as a film script gets? Will Munny hates the man he used to be. The more he talks about it, the more we want to see that side of him. We do. Payoff. It's that simple. Writers live by many mottos and one of them is this: Don't introduce it if you're not going to use it.The story offers up one innocent victim after another in the interest of drama and to create as much emotion as possible. It all feels so manufactured for some reason, like some characters are only introduced so they can be sacrificed. Just when you start getting involved with a character, they get killed. After a while, I gave up trying to like anyone in this movie. The story is an endless cycle of killing and revenge, and isn't much fun, at least not for me. I know there's a point in there somewhere and I think it's this: protecting what you love and fighting for what you believe in are the same thing.Roland Emmerich isn't my favorite director. To his credit, he does does have a shining moment here and there in this one (the cannonball flying right at the camera, for instance...nice). But after films like 'Universal Soldier' and 'Godzilla,' I wasn't optimistic. He's not quite in the big leagues yet. Maybe next time.Why didn't Mel direct this himself? It must have been torture for him to be in front of the camera all the time. During the battle scenes, when Emmerich wasn't setting it up right, Mel must have been ready to go off: 'No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Look, man, I know what I'm talking about! Want to see my Best Director Oscar?'Grade: C-",4,0,1,2 July 2000
Remember the Titans," too cute for its own good
","'Remember the Titans' reminds us that fear is the only thing standing in the way of a society not divided across racial lines. We fear those who are different than us. We tend to reject what we don't understand.The film is about the redistricting and forced integration of two high schools in Virginia in 1971. An all-white football team that has had great success its past few seasons must now give up parts of its roster to players from the school it's merging with-who just happen to be all black. The white players have played under coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), who is a nominee for the Virginia High School Football Hall of Fame. The school's athletic board, believing they can prove that integration is a bad idea, brings in Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black man, to replace him as head coach. They'll then sit and wait through training camp until Boone's team loses a game, then fire him. Yoast unexpectedly stays on as Boone's defensive coordinator, however, and they head for camp. Understandably, the white players have difficulty with the situation. They feel, justifiably, that their team was just fine the way it was. They know each other. They were winning.Another great point that Titans makes is that sometimes winning is not important. Coach Boone wants to win but, like all great coaches, he won't deny any kid who wants it the chance to compete and contribute. He designs the two-week training camp to force the boys to get to know each other. Like it or not, this is our team, is what he's saying to them. `I don't care if you like each other,' he tells them, `but you will respect each other.' At first, it looks like they'll do neither. Boone forces them to room with someone they don't know, which usually ends up being someone of a different race.  But this is a Disney movie and heck, a true story, so they do learn to respect each other. Then they learn to like each other. The result is a powerful, almost unstoppable high school football team.The players return to the real world to find that many of the citizens of Alexandria, the school's town, could have stood to go to Boone's camp themselves. The players overcome their first obstacle, their own fear. Now their new friendships will be put to the test by a backward society that hasn't had the benefit of the intensive bonding experience they just had. Some simply fear the team won't be as good as it was. This fear is quickly diminished. For some, though, it's just plain bigotry. Win or lose, they won't accept a group of black and white boys playing together as a team.Not only did this film come from the Mouse House, but it's also a Jerry Bruckheimer production. This strange combination has created a gritty film that's still family-friendly. Basically, they were trying to please everyone, young and old, male and female. For the most part, they succeed. Still, the Disney/Bruckheimer factor does hurt it in many ways. The singing and dancing for instance, even if it did really happen, should have been left out. It makes nice footage to put in a trailer, but when inserted into the actual film, it ruins the overall tone. What hurts most though, is that there was no hope of giving it the ending it really needed, namely the Titans losing.Okay, I know it's a true story. But T.C. Williams was not the only high school that was created by forced integration. A bolder move would have been choosing a different such school, one whos football team wasn't all that successful. Really, the Titans go undefeated. For one thing, from a sports perspective, what fun is that? But most importantly, the dream season they had begs the question: what if they'd lost a game or two? Or three? How would the town have felt about integration then? If the once-intolerant community still comes together across racial lines, it would mean more. All the film really shows is that that Alexandria is willing to accept integration--as long as the team remains as successful as it has been. What's worse is the film's tagline: `History is written by the winners.' What, exactly, is this supposed to mean?Still, I recommend 'Remember the Titans' ends up because it ends up being a pretty darn good sports movie. And even though its message could have been communicated even more powerfully, the film is more honest about the relationships between blacks and whites than maybe any other mass-market movie has been. Washington is great as usual, but the real stars are the young actors who play the Titans.Grade: B",Null,0,0,8 October 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Is the Academy brave enough to vote this Best Picture?
","When was the last time you found a martial arts film beautiful and touching? Ang Lee wants to give you something that holds your interest because of its visuals. The story is tailored around the many fight sequences that it contains. The difference, as it turns out, is that these people are allowed to live and breathe and have depth. Lee is not afraid to stop and explore his characters in a way that action/adventure films never do (chicks and dudes alike will enjoy this one, but probably for different reasons).The result is a completely unique cinematic experience. It didn't blow me away like it did for some. I haven't heard many people talk about how comedic this film really is. Lee can't help but borrow this trait from the Bruce Lee or even Jackie Chan school of filmmaking (the fight scenes were orchestrated by `Matrix' choreographer and long-time Jackie Chan collaborator Yuen Wo Ping). In this case, the humor is more obscure. For example, the climactic fight scene (which will go down in history as one of the best ever) between Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and her would-be apprentice Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) begs for laughter. They fight in the middle of an arsenal. Lien keeps grabbing larger, more imposing weapons to use against the magical, indestructible sword Jen has stolen. It lasts quite a long time and by the end, still you wish it would go on.  Then there's the Peter Pan' aspect of the combat these warriors use. It didn't work for me much of the time. To Lee's credit, though, at least he's attempted to create something fresh. At times, you can almost see the cable it's so obvious. At other times though, the effect is so cool you can't believe what you're seeing.  I rule in favor of its incorporation, but wish they'd used it more sparingly. `Tiger' deserves the acclaim it's received as much as any movie this year. What makes `Tiger' so appealing is that it's not trying to be an Oscar contender, nor any other kind of contender. It's like Crash Davis (you know, from `Bull Durham'). It just wants to Be. Same can be said of all the films nominated for a lot of hardware this year, `Traffic', `Gladiator', `Almost Famous' for example: they just ended up being really good. For one reason or another, they were weeded out of that vast pool of worthy films (well, not so vast this particular year). `Tiger' is certainly worthy. If it cleans up on March 25, I'll be happy for it.Grade: B",9,0,0,6 March 2001
Rules of Engagement," the other argument
","'Rules of Engagement' is the anti-'A Few Good Men.' The idea that drives William Friedkin's new film is that a soldier will do what he has to do, depending on the combat situation he is in. Often, the Rules of Engagement' need to be thrown aside in the interests of saving lives. Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) is sent to Yemen to evacuate the U.S. embassy where anti-American protesters have turned violent. He and the men under his command take fire from snipers as they evacuate the ambassador (Ben Kingsley) and his family. The evacuation is a success, but three marines die in the process. Childers now has a terrible choice to make in order to prevent more of his men from dying and he makes it. This is basically a courtroom drama, so it will naturally draw comparisons with the Rob Reiner/Aaron Sorkin classic. One contrast between the two is that the devoted soldier' mentality condemned in 'A Few Good Men' is honored in 'Rules of Engagement.' We want the people commanding our armed forces to have not only skill, but also the ability to sacrifice lives and carry out orders, regardless of the moral dilemma.  This is who Childers is. He's Colonel Jessep, only with his head on straight. So perhaps 'Rules' isn't quite the anti-'Few Good Men,' but sort of the Other Argument. These men place themselves willingly into situations most of us would never wish for. `You want me on that wall! You NEED me on that wall!' are Jessep's words to Caffey during the home stretch of 'AFGM.' The message in both films is that we expect these men to follow the same moral imperative that civilians do, even as we sit safe at home under their nice 'blanket of protection.'One of many things 'Rules' gets right is the way it lays bare the violence of armed combat to show it for what it is: killing without mercy. The best decision that Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist) made here was to limit our perception of the Yemen events by giving us the same view that anyone who wasn't there would have. All we are shown initially is the act, and then the photos of the carnage Childers created with his decision. The director feeds the information to us through a series of flashbacks and other clues. It isn't until the film's third act that we have a full understanding of why Childers acted as he did. This waiting for the other shoe to drop keeps the film perpetually engaging. In Jackson's performance we see a man wrestling with what he has done, desperately needing his duty as a soldier to justify his actions, the only way he can go on breathing like a normal human being.Both Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones perform ably here. Jones was a great choice to play Colonel Hays Hodges, Childers' lawyer and longtime friend. He brings weakness and vulnerability to his character, plus a number of things that were crucial to the role, things we haven't seen in a Tommy Lee Jones character before. Hodges has carried shame around with him for decades and now has something to prove both to himself and his family. Jones' performance captures this inner turmoil.'Rules of Engagement' isn't a great film, but it is a compelling piece of work with some good performances and characters. Chalk it up as a quality military courtroom drama, but nowhere near as good as 'A Few Good Men.' In fact, there are many other films out there, all available on home video, that illustrate the inner moral struggle of a soldier better than this one does; 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Three Kings' (the best film of 99), and 'Courage Under Fire' to name just a few.Grade: C",5,3,5,9 May 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Tom Cruise: International Man Of Mystery
","'Mission: Impossible 2' is pretty much a hodge-podge of favorites from the action/adventure genre: A car chase down a winding, cliffside road; a surveillance scene at a race track; the action-hero-sent-to-recruit-beautiful-jewel-thief-but-falls-in-love-with-her -instead plotline; a plane crashing into a mountain; the manly action hero dangling from a cliff--for leisure. This film is like an 'action movie valu-pack.' All the ingredients of your favorite action movie flavors all in one movie! For one low price!Wouldn't it be nice if someone created a completely original character, rather than simply ripping off James Bond all the time?  Bond was a great idea forty years ago, when it was new. Example: Indiana Jones, an archaeologist searching for lost artifacts--one of the best movie characters anyone ever thought up. What we're basically offered here, though, is another spy movie about--and I still can't believe the blatant unoriginality--a madman who wants to unleash a killer virus. Tom Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt (a name almost as cool as 'Tom Cruise'), would like to stop him. Might as well call it 'Austin Powers 3.' After watching this dreck, I kind of missed the twisty, incomprehensible plot of 1997's 'Mission: Impossible.' Even if you couldn't understand what was going on half the time, at least it was interesting. At least the story held true to the spirit of the 'Mission: Impossible' TV series and opened with a team mission. The excuse for Cruise being a loner for the rest of the movie is that most of his team members are killed in that opening sequence (sorry for the spoiler). In the sequel, Robert Towne and John Woo have no such excuse. They never even attempt to introduce a team concept.Instead, we're given Tom Cruise. With long hair. Riding a motorcycle. Through fire. In slow motion. The film's creators go to great lengths to insure their star looks as cool as possible. I can't understand why Cruise wants to be Jean-Claude Van Damme all of a sudden. He doesn't even know martial arts, and yet here he is, jumping around, kicking people in the face. Who decided, I wonder, that two guys who can't fight beating the crap out of each other was fun to watch?John Woo's goal, to break his own record for slow motion shots in a film, is achieved here (when a dove flies across the frame in slow motion as a stony-eyed Cruise walks toward us, I swear I wished it would crap on him). Had all of M:I 2's slow motion shots been done at normal speed, the film would've been a half hour long.  Woo invented what is now being dubbed 'beautiful violence,' a filming style now in use by every action director on earth. With his latest, Woo seems determined to drive his own invention into the ground.Grade: D",2,0,0,8 June 2000
Final Destination," Not for the squeamish
","We've all heard the phrase, `kids do the craziest things-they think they're invincible.'  Given the recent surge of teen slasher movies like 'Scream' and 'Urban Legend,' Hollywood producers are well aware of this truth. Seems like they're serving up a little reminder to the youth of America: Your number could come up at any moment, just like anybody else.Even if Hollywood has no such intentions, it has discovered that their younger audiences are getting more sophisticated and are looking for new and clever ways to see themselves get killed. The latest killing spree film, Final Destination, doesn't mess around with guns and psycho killers, but gets right to the point: The killer here literally IS Death, which proves It can get pretty creative when it comes time to claim somebody. The idea is that Death has a design for everyone, that each moment of our lives is just a cycle of events that lead up to the End.  We're free to live our lives as long as Death lets us. Pretty depressing stuff but there is a point, which I'll explore in a minute. First, the nuts and bolts of the story...Seems Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a high school senior, is given a special, unexplained ability to foresee his demise.  He sees it exactly as it's going to happen, in one of the most terrifying sequences ever filmed.  Apparently Death hadn't taken this into account; Alex goes berzerk and warns others of what's about to happen. A few people are saved, but most of the people involved proceed right into Death's arms, just as Alex foresaw (I'm not going to give away the details of this opening sequence, simply because too many other people, plus the film's trailer, have already ruined it). So here we have seven people who Death was all ready to claim, alive and safe. Apparently, this makes Death mad and It starts to pick them off one by one. Seeing as these people, five of Alex's fellow students and one teacher, defied Death's original plan, Death has to get creative. The most mundane of household objects, most of which we would never think of as lethal, are used together in bizarre, sometimes silly, chain reactions of events that lead to the kill.  All of these scenes are shocking, gruesome, or both, so be warned: this film is not for everybody.Along with having visions of his own death, Alex is able to foresee others' deaths and tries again to cheat the Reaper. He beat It once, and believes he can do so again (ah, the ego of the teenage male). There's a scene in which Alex knows it's his turn to go, so he locks himself inside a remote cabin and duct tapes down anything and everything that could possibly turn into a lethal object. He eats pudding from a tin can, having used leather work gloves to open it, sloshing the food around in his mouth to make sure there's nothing hard inside that he could choke on. This was a funny moment, and humor is something this movie uses well to give the audience a break. The scene reminded me of the way a parent of a curious toddler would start to think about household objects in a way she never thought of them before. This parent starts thinking of scenarios in which, a ball of yarn for instance, could become lethal.  Whether you think this is wisdom or paranoia, that parent understands one thing: Death does not discriminate. It happens to the helpless, the innocent, those who least `deserve' it. As cold and unfeeling as this film seems most of the time, it takes care to illustrate this point.This ain't no masterpiece, but this was an innovative piece of work; a worthy first crack at feature directing by TV veteran James Wong.  In the simplest terms, Final Destination is one hell of a good thrill ride. Suspend your disbelief at the ticket office and buckle up.Grade: B-",7,0,0,17 April 2000
Thirteen Days," Elmer Fudd saves the world
","It's hard to imagine. The fate of the world in the hands of the Kennedy brothers and some joe named Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner, sounding eerily like Elmer Fudd at times). These three were apparently the White House inner inner circle.My own knowledge of the events is fuzzy. I hate to call this film educational, but it's now the account of the Cuban Missile Crisis that I will remember. It makes me want to read more about it, to see what's true and what isn't. Hopefully others won't be so quick to accept the film as gospel and look upon it as what it really is: entertainment.Like any Hollywood movie with a Kennedy in it, Jack and Bobby are treated as infallible protectors of everything good. No other president has more stories surrounding him, more speculation about his personal life and beliefs. When Bruce Greenwood (in the best performance of the film) tells O'Donnell, kiddingly, that he wishes 'someone else were president', we'd understand if he meant it. Hollywood has us believing the world would be a better place had JFK survived longer than three years in office. Kennedy's clashes with the military establishment is used for drama in 'Thirteen Days', but doesn't take over the story. It's the cat-and-mouse game, the fact that these three men seem able only to trust each other, that makes the film so compelling.The Crisis is so important because it's the one time in history where the world really seemed to be on the brink of nuclear annihilation. There was a chance, however small, that something could go wrong. 'Cooler heads' might not prevail. 'Thirteen Days' takes you inside of it, giving you things like the White House staff's reactions to Adlai Stevenson's 'til hell freezes over' declaration to the Soviet U.N. delegate. Even if things didn't happen exactly this way, you see what it must have been like. Accurately depicted is the weight of the situation. You can feel the life-or-death quality of each decision these men faced.Lest we forget that there are still enough nuclear weapons in silos around the world to destroy it twenty times over, the film is some timely food for thought.Grade: B",8,0,0,20 January 2001
Gladiator," When In Rome...
","The tag line for this film is `A Hero Will Rise.' Ain't that the truth. Make no mistake, Dreamworks' promotion for Gladiator has the principle purpose of launching this guy to the top of the Hollywood A-list. `Can we get Russell Crowe?' will soon be the number one question asked in production offices across Tinseltown. Looks like filmmakers have finally found a performer who is the Real Deal as it were. I mean, the intensity of his performances evoke true toughness: you feel like you'd trust the guy with your life. Can you now or could you ever say that about Costner? Cage? Keanu? Arnold? Crowe is here to stay and puts the hero back into movie heroics.His new film is another good story in the vein of 'Braveheart'-not a bad blueprint to follow. The reservations I have about 'Gladiator' all come from the familiarity of some of the scenes. The whole hero of the people' thing it's got going; the retelling of the ages-old story of the struggle against totalitarianism. Here is another one, a good one, set in a time and place we haven't seen depicted in cinema for quite some time. The film uses its height-of-the-Roman Empire setting well and delivers on the promise of action and adventure. Set in the last days of the good Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the film takes on the familiar subject of a World Power worrying a little too much about its neighbors and not tending to its own growing problems at home. In the opening scene, Marcus watches his powerful Roman army, led by his general and respected friend Maximus (Crowe), tear into a rebelling army of Germanic barbarians. This opening scene is a huge, loud, impressive spectacle that the movie never really tops. The Emperor would like to pass along rule of the Empire to Maximus, which comes as disturbing news to Marcus' disgraceful son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Commodus sees to it that his father's dying wish is not carried out, and promptly orders Maximus executed. From here on, bad things happen to Maximus and to Rome, with the evil nervous wreck Commodus behind it all.Maximus, thought dead by the new Emperor, is sold into slavery and trained to fight in the gladiator' games, the entertainment choice of the times until they were abolished by Marcus Aurelius. Commodus, however, brings the games back. In the past, gladiators who could win over the crowds in the Colosseum would earn their freedom. Maximus has something else to fight for-revenge. Director Ridley Scott ('Alien,' 'Blade Runner,' 'Thelma and Louise,' 'G.I. Jane') stages the arena scenes with pure entertainment in mind, just as the real things were. The whole idea of the games was to re-enact in a way, great wars fought and won by Rome. So here is Maximus, as a gladiator, pretending to be a soldier in an army he had likely conquered as a general in real life. This is when Maximus' character really gets under our skin. A lesser person might wallow in the obvious humiliation of his situation, but Maximus doesn't. He finds every opportunity to use it for the benefit of himself and his estranged countrymen. The story is so strong that these arena scenes become simply pieces of the whole that help to propel things forward. Scott never succumbs to the temptation of showing any more brutality than is necessary.Joaquin Phoenix creates a truly loathsome human being in Commodus. This is the kind of twitchy, insecure kid a father would keep his daughter miles away from and here he is in charge of the world's greatest empire. The casting of Phoenix; along with Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Oliver Reed, and of course Crowe, shows that Gladiator's creators preferred substance over style.The casting, the photography, the writing-all of these things seem to have been given great care. The result is what will probably end up being one of the year's best films.Grade: B",9,0,0,12 May 2000
High Fidelity," good movie, better book
","John Cusack's latest manic love story is not only based on Nick Hornby's novel of the same name, but nearly copies the book word for word.  When I read the book a couple of years ago, I remember thinking what a great movie it would make. When I heard that John Cusack would be starring in sort of an Americanized version, I could see it. Just the right fit.
Now that I've seen the finished product, which is pretty much what I envisioned, I'm a bit disappointed. For one thing, I didn't expect Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, to talk into the camera all the way through the movie.  I thought they'd find a more inventive way to show the inner workings of this thoroughly confused person's mind.  Nearly every time Rob is talking to another character, he'll turn to the camera and give us his thoughts, sort of including us in the conversation.  I'm all for innovative filmmaking, but this just seems like a cop-out to me.  We like movies because they find ways to show what's going on in a person's head through their interaction with others and their behavior.  If they'd cut Rob's monologues, the film would have been a half hour long.  This type of blatant exposition is becoming a problem in the industry as a whole:  too many thought-revealing voice-overs and other conversations that sound like someone reading from an encyclopedia.Not that high fidelity is a bad movie.  It's actually very amusing most of the time and I'm sure if I hadn't read the book, I'd have enjoyed it more. Music and the intense emotions behind it create the film's landscape.  It's fun to watch the arguments over what songs belong in a certain `top five' list. In fact, Rob and his employees, Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), have a Top Five songs for every life situation.  For example: when Rob's girlfriend's father dies, they create a `top five songs about death' as a tribute to the man, which is the only way they know how to express their sympathy.  The result of all the lists and mix tapes is a very eclectic mix of music of all styles and from all eras.  It's proof that when you mix it all together, you find that the old stuff is just as cool or, more times than not, cooler than the new stuff.Rob's Top Five All-Time Worst Breakups is the list on which the entire story is based.  He uses it to deal with his frustration over his latest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle).  This is one area in which the film improves upon the book:  Laura's character is more fully developed here.  Rob comes up with the list just so he can leave her off of it, to prove how little she really mattered to him (when in fact, she's the love of his life).  High-profile actresses Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Lisa Bonet take small roles as the other loved and lost women of Rob's life.  Rob is not an easy guy to like, the way he uses these poor women just to sort his own feelings out.Seeing the film version makes me want to go back and read the book, a format in which the narrator is welcome to express his feelings right to the audience.  If you're about to go and see the movie, don't.  Read the book instead or at least read it first and then see the film if you must.  So consider this the official warning:  the book is better.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," a musical journey
","'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is unmistakably a Coen brothers film. I first noticed the common denominator between all their films when I was watching 'Fargo' for the first time: These guys' films feel like they're made up as they go along, even if they're not. Fortunately, the results are always good (aside from the disappointing 'Big Lebowski').I suspect they employed their usual 'anything goes' strategy to 'O Brother'. This time though, whatever story there is seems to take a back seat to what the boys really hoped to accomplish with this film. In the liner notes to the film's soundtrack, the Coens describe the film as a sort of valentine to the music of the pre-Great Depression era. 'There are very few scenes in the movie that don't have an in-screen musical element to them,' says Joel. Thinking back on the film, indeed, a scene not driven by music or built around music is hard to find. While the boys manage to piece together a quality story by merrying up folklore with the bonafide history of the South, it's all about incorporating the music, somehow, some way. 'O Brother' is about as close as there is to a musical that isn't a musical.To quote the liner notes again, 'Before a single frame of film was shot, these musicians and others created the 'canvas' upon which the colorful saga of O Brother Where ArtThou? would be painted'. So first they had their theme, namely, spirituality. The condition of the soul. Sin, punishment, and forgiveness. The Coens must have felt that as long as they abided by this theme, the story would take care of itself. Any story about the old South could be about the thick mist of good and evil spirits that inhabit it. It's the American home of both God and Beelzebub, of more angels and demons than any other region. One of the film's best sequences features escaped convicts Delmar and Pete (Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro) wading into a river to be baptised and cleansed of all sins. In the very next scene the convicts (Nelson, Turturro, George Clooney) pick up a hitchhiker (aptly named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King) at a crossroads, who tells them he's just sold his soul to the devil so he can play the guitar and make lots of money. The four of them then proceed to the next recording studio and cut a hit record together. Fantasic!'O Brother' is a playful, flaccid romp through the backwoods of Mississippi. I couldn't help but imagine how much fun these guys were having making this thing and the attitude is contageous. It's the year's funniest film. Ethan's too smart for his own good sometimes though, and a lot of it flies right over your head. The humor takes you by surprise but doesn't shock you.'O Brother Where Art Thou' won't be looked back upon as a Coen brothers masterpiece. It's no 'Fargo' or 'Miller's Crossing'.Grade: A-",10,0,1,17 January 2001
