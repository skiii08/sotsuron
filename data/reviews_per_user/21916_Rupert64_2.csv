Alien 3," The Special Edition DVD - causes a rethink - SPOILERS
","Having just watched the special edition DVD, that comes with the Quadrilogy, I have to conclude that I need to re-evaluate my opinions on this film.Yes, I was aware of the problems that Fincher had with the film during its filming, but when I went to the cinema to see the film on its release, I came away feeling let down (as a fan of the two previous films) and more importantly confused.Now (although without Fincher's blessing) we can have a clearer idea of the vision that he was driving for.  Whilst this DVD is not the classic many had hoped for, the inclusion of more character detail, storyline depth and the motivations of Golick and the company have made the whole experience not only more comprehensive, but far more compelling if not that much more scary.So for those of you who have an interest in the series I recommend another view of the film in its SE status.  With its far more developed religious themes and Ripley characterisation and personally think most of you will be very pleasantly surprised.",7,1,3,30 November 2003

","While this is not a perfect film, I came away from the cinema feeling I had seen something new, worthwhile, thrilling and innovative.New in the sense it was not a traditional or modern zombie film, in fact it seems to borrow more from the Crazies and the Omega Man rather than Romero's classics (although there are some obvious homage to them as well)Worthwhile in the sense that the characters were developed more, especially in the first half of the film and the desolation and isolationist feel was well communicated.  Also the film took a brave leap in the second half that some have disliked.  Certainly I felt this was an interesting direction more reminisent of Apocalypse Now than the usual zombie flick and introduced new character elements with new messages.Innovative, certainly was the digital aspect of the film, the graininess working very well, contributing to the atmosphere and the realism. This was for mind the most impressive achievement.On the other side the infected are monsterous and the vision bleak. Recommended and throughly enjoyed. 8/10",7,0,0,9 November 2002
