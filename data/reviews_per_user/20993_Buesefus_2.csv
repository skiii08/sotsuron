The Blair Witch Project," Haven't I Seen This Before
","OK, I disliked this movie, and because of that I'm not one of the 'norm.' However, for all of you who liked this movie and go crazy when people don't like it, think about this:Picture seeing this movie as you'd see any other; without the home camera medium. Looks familiar, right? Just like, oh I don't know, ANY 80'S HORROR MOVIE!!!Stupid kids are in the woods, and get lost. Instead of doing anything sensible, they just camp and scream. Then one disappears, and instead of running like hell, they wander around more. Then to top it off, they see a strange house with screams coming from it, and decide to...that's right, GO INSIDE!Sounds like any horror movie, but just because it used an original medium (the video camera), it is praised as a brilliant piece of art.Just think about it.",Null,0,0,10 October 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Utter Crap
","I'm sorry, this has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I went with 3 friends, and they were all so scared they couldn't sleep. But I just said 'Who cares' Probably because they spent too much time screaming at each other then anything else. After 10 minutes of 'You %$*# got us lost!', 'I %&$#* hate you!', etc. I got bored. After 20 minutes, I almost fell asleep. After the whole...what was it...40 minutes, I wanted to leave. The main question is why they taped everything. The reason was so tacked on. It's like they knew viewers would ask that, so they came up with the first stupid reason they could. And if I was running for my life, I WOULD NOT tape it. I would probobly throw the camera at the thing, hoping to slow it down. The ending wasn't shocking either. I didn't even know what happened because I wasn't paying attention. I was too annoyed abut the other 81 1/2 minutes that were wasted. That's right, the ending is about 30 seconds long. Ohh, really worth it. Not to mention they are also coming out with the following due to the success of the movie: - a prequel movie (how the Blair Witch came to be) - a sequel - a TV series The movie will wear itself out, and I'm glad.",Null,0,1,25 August 1999
