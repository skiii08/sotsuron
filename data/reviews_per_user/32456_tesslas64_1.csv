Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The most dreadful creation ever!
","This movie is the absolute worst thing I have ever witnessed. It manages to be explicit, (how did the naked wrestling scene between Borat and his sidekick not get a NC17? DISGUSTING!!!!!!!) It is offensive, not funny, and just an absolute waste of time. I think this movie will only be appreciated by people of low intelligence and bigots. I am not a narrow minded person, but this film manages to offend everyone in a scant hour and a half. The plot drags and is poorly written, and horridly acted. There are a few funny scenes involving a bear and an ice cream truck. And I loved the 'man on the street humor.' But enough of the 'sexy' talk. NOBODY needs to see the things I saw last night. And Sasha, I think I have seen your future, and Yakov Smirnoff called, he wants his act back. I feel sorry for Sascha's cousin who is a noted scholar in researching autism. After seeing the movie I can understand where much of his research must have came from. It was gross.I am so sick of all this drivel that the studios keep grinding out. BAD FORM 20th Century Fox. Even your company can do better than this sewer comedy.",1,26,148,21 September 2006
