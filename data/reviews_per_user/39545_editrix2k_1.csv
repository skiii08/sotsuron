Requiem for a Dream," Twenty-First Century 'Reefer Madness'
","I had high hopes for this film based on the great cast, but alas, the willingness of fine actors to debase themselves coupled with extraordinary production values do not make up for the ideological bankruptcy of this film.  The territory was covered better 30 years ago in 'Panic in Needle Park.'  The over-the-top scenarios depicted in this film will be unlikely to deter people from experimenting with drugs: in 50 years it will take its place alongside the 1920s-era, unintentionally funny film 'Reefer Madness' for its absurdity and poor research.  For example, the pupils of an individual mainlining heroin *constrict*, although the movie shows them *dilating* time and time again -- even though these scenes contain mesmerizing effects and quick cuts, they are factually wrong.  The film has the 'just say no' seal of approval -- long on the gore and fear-mongering, short on reality, and no attempt at all to address the underlying issues behind the desire to do drugs or the economy that caters to it.",Null,0,0,7 July 2001
