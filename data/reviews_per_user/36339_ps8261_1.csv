The Monuments Men," Awful movie..Expected more from cast
","This was the worst movie I have seen this year. Although the cast are fabulous actors, it was a waste of great talent. The idea behind the story was interesting, but the movie itself was boring! My wife was about to fall asleep. The attendance was about 20 people for an evening showing on opening night. Wait for the DVD release as this movie would have better as a premium channel showing.There was no action or real drama contained in the movie. I am not sure the movie does just for the real Monument Men.George Clooney,I would like a refund please.",3,13,26,8 February 2014
