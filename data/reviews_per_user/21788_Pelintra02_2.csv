Alien 3," The Love it or Hate it Cult Film
","Rest assured, most of us have a detailed assumption of the production troubles David Fincher had to endure making this film. I am one of those damn fans that defends Alien 3 as a highly stylized above the norm sci fi flick, that whilst not falling into the title of masterpiece, is still a brilliant exercise in the darker pleasures of cinema. Alien 3 is an anti climax, or perhaps Aliens was so climatic that there was no need for another sequel. Accepted on its own terms however this may well be a hidden gem of the 90's sci fi cinema.Yes Hollywood is run by the dollar but Alien 3 is a story within a story, the gritty, gun less battle between the nadir of mankind and a lone Xenomorph. It is also Fincher Vs. Fox, the question which may never be answered is: did he save a disaster of film from being a total disaster or did he escape the hands of his accommodates with a stylish but flawed above par mood piece. Out of personal preference I like to think of the second option. Fincher did bring the most creatively shot film to the franchise, and Alien 3 is also the blueprint for Fincher's later artist success's such as his most known works 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club'.The characters in the theatrical release are indeed at times confusing to tell apart, but the films main supporting leads are well drawn out and acted by excellent turns from Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton . Dances character, Clemens does seem underused but as the franchise has frequently shown us, even the strongest of leads can become the creatures next victim. The take no prisoners aspect of Alien 3 works much better than many of its genres other titles surprisingly. The proof is in the visceral impact Fincher allows you to intake, and make no mistake, Alien 3 is not a feel good film. Weaver gives a restrained but affectionate portrayal to the Ripley character, and in the films emotionally climatic ending some can understand that the restrained performance was a good compliment to it.In terms of Art direction the film is a complete success, especially if one views the assembly cut. It's also always a good thing to have the talented Mr H.R Giger at the helm when designing the runner. So how about the Alien in this film, well he certainly is the most unpleasant the franchise has to offer, and its to Finchers credit that his damp and lonely shots of the 'Fury' capture some of the spark the original Alien possessed. The fear is not in the jumps that the audience receives but in the ominous tone of the film as you just don't know where the creature is lurking. Plot holes are also indeed little, a big misunderstanding about a movie like this is the shouting of the words 'plot' and 'hole' unless your personal opinion on events is compromised there isn't much left unexplained.One of the complaint's about Alien 3 is its CGI, as this was a movie to use some of the first early CGI techniques of the 90's, however weak shots of the creatures CGI are short and in-between. Perhaps my biggest grievance lies in the pacing of the films near final 10 minutes, Fincher does manage to create a kinetic energy to hide this flaw however and the ending of the film also makes these 10 minutes redeemable. Final consensus of this film is in my opinion a high one, I long made peace with it's first 15 opening minutes and concentrated on the substance of the film as a whole. Alien 3 is a strong and satisfying ending to a brilliant franchise Â…..if you allow it to be in the most honest of manners.",8,4,42,19 January 2008
300," Fantastic Art Direction and a Good Performance from Gerard Butler Cant Save this from Being a Disappointment
","Remember that visually breathtaking trailer, you know, the one with the excellent Nine Inch Nails track 'Just Like You Imagined' It came crashing along like the thunderstorm it promised to be back in 2007, but sadly promises can be broken. That said trailer should only be watched if your wanting to avoid this, at times inspired but often mixed baggage of a fantasy film.The main problem with 300 is the pacing and overused CGI, but it doesn't help that pretty much every character here is immensely stereotyped in terms of gender and moral code. The actors led by a charismatic turn from Gerard Butler do a fair decent job at fitting into these roles, but one cant help feel a tad bit unsympathetic for these 300 men of Sparta. This combination of pacing and stereotyping results in a dumbing down of sorts, which is not Frank Millers fault.The original novel this film does indeed stick close to, but things feel claustrophobic when the genre shouldn't be and the art direction whilst fantastic is rarely shot in full view by director Zack Snyder. This was a similar complaint I had with Sin City ,but I suppose for some, its suburban location benefited the film in a better way. Snyder leaves the art for the visceral shots but this is not what an 'epic' fantasy novel is about . There is no artistic compromise to the film and there is nothing ultimately new here that will distinguish it from its other genre titles. Action, which was 300's main selling point is also something left to the imagination.These rough and tough warriors clash, but that's actually all they do. After the same 'push them back' formula is continued three times it gets damn monotonous and you wish that these Spartan boys would just whip out there sabers and get on with it. This does eventually happen, but only once. The rest of the time Snyder treats the action with too many slow motion effects and thus tension is reduced to a nought. It is here I find myself entertained but to a mind numbingly extent. A high rating it may have in 2008, but time, I believe will not be kind to this disappointing film.",5,0,1,21 January 2008
