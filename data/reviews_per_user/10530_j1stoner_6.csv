The Lobster," Maximum Weirdness
","It's very dark comedy, a combination of great beauty (the scenery, the animals) and great ugliness. The actors tried very hard--though they were limited by being forced to recite most of their lines in a monotone--and there were certainly some interesting characters, surprising plot twists, powerful music, and some pointed satire referring to some of the strangeness about our own society's mating rituals. I will give the authors credit for staying true to their artistic vision--but it is a sick one, in my humble opinion. Because of the undoubted merits I mention above, I cannot give it the lowest rating, but I really do not recommend it. It was about two hours long, but it felt like five, and the ending didn't justify the wait.",4,1,2,4 June 2016
Youth," Good follow-up to 'La Grande Bellezza'
","A lot should be expected of Paolo Sorrentino after 'La Grande Bellezza', and there is a lot here. In particular, I should mention first the scenery and cinematography, and the music, all of which are sublime.The dialogue is provocative, full of memorable lines and strong emotions, so kudos to the writers. The subject matter was heavy, but there is a fair share of lighter moments, and, in particular, irony.I would not think that the acting was at all improvised, with the possible exception of some of the riffing the 'screenwriters' working with Harvey Keitel's character were doing. Still, strong performances in particular from Keitel, Jane Fonda in a small role, the young actress who plays the masseuse, and a dignified Michael Caine.Sorrentino continues to give homage to Fellini, which I love, while his central characters (Caine in this one, Toni Servillo in LGB) work through the kind of existential issues which Fellini tackled and which Sorrentino, though he is not an old man, seems to be anticipating. Nostalgia, regret, the sweetness and the bitterness that comes from the awareness of the limitations of our short lives. The one thing that struck me as useless to the story--maybe I just didn't get it--was the turn Paul Dano's character made for a couple of scenes as...well, I shouldn't spoil it. It struck everyone in the scenes as inappropriate, and I guess that was the point, but really, why? For me, that takes it down to a 9 rating--still, a top-notch effort.",9,18,33,2 June 2015
Interstellar," Well-Realized Fantasy
","I had the good fortune to find 'Interstellar' in a cinema here in Milano yesterday evening in the original language, with subtitles. That's pretty rare here: the dubbing industry remains very strong, with skilled practitioners, and most Italians prefer to watch most films in Italian. I did find that having the original dialogue helped a lot with this movie, as it was not so much that the dialogue was complex, but that it retained the emotional content and inflections of the original actors. The titles (in Italian, of course) actually helped to keep from losing those parts which were 'mumbled', an issue I see increasingly in American films. I guess it's realistic treatment to portray speaking roles in the way people actually speak--in the opposite direction from the hearer, asides barely heard--as opposed to declaiming theatrically.Anyway, the movie made a deep impression and gave me a lot to think about. I am actually doing two reviews of it--this one, of a more general nature, and one which will go into more depth about some of the issues brought up in the climactic final hour. That one, which necessarily has some spoilers about some of the surprising turns toward the end of the movie, will go into a time capsule here and be released in a few months, when the first run (and anticipated post- Oscar continuation of that run) are over, and everyone has had the opportunity and time to see it. I feel that is very appropriate treatment for this movie.I make a distinction between the old-style science fiction and the genre which has largely displaced it in recent decades, fantasy fiction. The main difference between the two is that science fiction should seek to place its narratives in a world we can see as a possible one (past, present, or future). Recognition, or explanation, of scientific understanding helps guide key aspects of the story in directions outside our normal experience, but still possible. Fantasy is not limited by the conventions of possible reality: instead its authors are allowed to consider worlds that may not be possible, beings that may never exist, and scenarios that could never realistically occur. All fiction requires the suspension of disbelief--we need to believe, in the case of historical fiction for example, that the dialogues and events not historically recorded are real. Fantasy differs in that we need to accept, temporarily, an alternate reality. I would argue that 'Interstellar' is fantasy--a well-presented one--but one that is contrary to what could ever be possible.To recap the premise of the story of the movie, something that has been widely disclosed (so no spoiler here), a near-future plague is destroying all of the world's food crops. Only corn remains, and its continued viability is at risk. The population is already decimated and is in the process of dying out. A possible way to continue the species appears in the form of interstellar travel, through the fortuitous appearance of a space-time wormhole near Saturn, to some distant galaxies which may be able to support human life.One little problem: interstellar travel is way beyond the capability of the human race, now and for the foreseeable future. Of course, in a movie titled 'Interstellar', set just a few decades in the future, this is actually a fundamental problem. Director Christopher Nolan, who with his brother wrote the story, goes to great lengths to provide scientific underpinning for his fantastic construct. Some of it has validity, while some I could recognize, even with my freshman physics knowledge, was impossible, though mostly subtly so. I give him credit for trying to make the workings of interstellar travel believable, something that others--I think of 'Avatar', the 'Aliens' series, 'Star Trek'--don't even attempt. This effort does contribute to the value of the entertainment, though. What we see in 'Interstellar' is a variety of people, people not unlike us, in a highly-stressful situation and their human reactions and behavior. There is emotional content, there are characters who develop through the story, there is some study of how decisions are made under stress, there is even philosophy. It is a human story, and a humane one. Violence is present, but in the proper measure; love is a primary factor. As a fantasy, it is quite a satisfying one: complex in its presentation, plenty of food for thought during and after, and the audio-visual aspect is all we should expect. (I might like to see it in Imax.)I would say it sets a new standard in the genre of space fantasy for its depth and attempt at lucidity. In that sense, it exceeds movies like 'Gravity'--which was not fantasy but similar in its drama and some key aspects--or 'Avatar'. I would compare it most directly to '2001: A Space Odyssey' (to which it's certainly better in the lucidity aspect, though maybe not the artistic ones) and to 'Contact' (the Jodie Foster movie from some 20 years ago, based on a story by Carl Sagan). Both share with 'Interstellar' a philosophy that man's destiny is in the stars, but 'Interstellar' puts a different twist on it. 'Interstellar' has a great cast, with several big stars playing their characters (not just themselves-- even Matthew McConnaughy, though he does bring a bit more redneck to the role than I thought was needed)--I was particularly tickled to see Wes Bentley (of 'American Beauty') and Jeff Hephner (of 'Boss'). Finally, I see some parallels with another, supposedly earth-bound, fantasy: 'The Wizard of Oz' (however, no singing, though the musical score was excellent).Even as a fantasy, 'Interstellar' is hardly perfect, but to go into the errors--in concept, and in details--would require giving away too much. Check the time capsule in a few months. My guess for Oscar: about 8-9 nominations, including sound, music, sets, a couple for acting, original screenplay, director, Best Picture, and 3-4 wins.",10,0,1,7 December 2014
Django Unchained," Not very funny; violence more than sufficient
","It's not that there is no humor; I laughed out loud maybe twice. Very early on, though, it becomes clear that we are supposed to be enthralled (amused? impressed?) by unrealistic gun play and explosive red blots, and that theme continues throughout. Christoph Waltz clearly enjoyed his role and performs it with relish and a twinkle in his eye. Every time he opened his mouth, I thought 'Richard Dreyfuss'--I don't say that is either good nor bad, but to me, it was Waltz playing Dreyfuss playing this role. Jamie Foxx seemed to take his role too seriously, as the movie does not deserve it, or maybe he just doesn't do comedy well anymore (I seem to remember some funny bits on 'In Living Color', but that was long ago.) Samuel Jackson played his role as 'house Negro' well, but he didn't do himself much honor by taking it. There were some good cameos, particularly Don Johnson as a slaveowner in Tennessee, and Franco Nero as an Italian owner of a Mandingo fighter in Mississippi. Quentin Tarantino's cameo was ridiculously bad acting; he should refrain from putting himself in future movies. Leonardo DiCaprio's role as a degenerate slaveowner was generally well portrayed, from a stylistic point of view. I would say his character's dialogue was not particularly well written, but he has no particular cause for complaint, as bad dialogue prevails throughout, except for some ill-fitting attempts at intellectual discourse, which I saw as showy and superficial in such a mindlessly violent exercise. (I suppose the bad dialogue could be said to be intentional, but it earns Tarantino no credit.)What else? I don't object to the excessive use of the 'n' word, as it probably is realistic for the period. Unlike, say, 'Huckleberry Finn', its use doesn't have anything profound to say about slavery except that some slaves would really have liked to kill every white person in sight (not too surprising, probably). The closest to something meaningful was when DiCaprio's character asks the interesting question: 'Why do the slaves not kill their masters?' and doesn't answer it. Clearly many of the bad guys deserved what they got, but not all of them, and the script shows little discrimination (so to speak). The plot was tediously predictable, though I do admit I knew the outlines of it before I went in to see it. Tarantino's use of old-fashioned spaghetti Western titles, Nero, and the song performed in Italian (could get a nomination, if the field is weak enough) was probably his most interesting directorial motif, but it was neither surprising, funny, nor profound.",6,23,54,30 December 2012
Avatar," Great movie but flawed 8/10 (light spoilage)
","James Cameron's Avatar is a landmark film, a fully-realized and brilliantly-executed vision of complexity and passion. It promises to be a runaway hit, a strong contender for the Best Picture Oscar, and a point of reference for movies of its genre--special effects-driven sci- fi epic thrillers--for decades to come. Avatar is a story set in the future (the date shown is 2154, a point to which I'll return). At any rate, it's close enough to the present that people are more or less the same in their motivations and ways of thinking and acting, but they have greater technological capability, including suspended hibernation and interstellar travel. Our hero is a Marine veteran named Jake Sully who's lost use of his legs, but is recruited nevertheless to accompany a 'scientific' expedition on an alien planet, populated by 10-foot tall blue humanoids, who live in a forest world (called 'Pandora') which the human invaders covet. Human society's imminent collapse due to overpopulation and environmental degradation has sent our descendants on a mission of colonization and exploitation. I am no technical expert and am certainly not qualified to explain how the movie was filmed. Certainly computer-generated imagery is central to the many scenes set in Pandora, but that doesn't begin to describe the various effects, or how it affects us. I will say that the use of 3D is better, and more meaningful, than I have ever seen. The key leap of faith for our story is the development of a hybrid of human and 'Ni'va' (the Pandorans), which the human can mentally inhabit through some sort of sleep in a chamber. Our hero accidentally ends up with the locals, becomes accepted by them, and ultimately is brought into their society as a full member--just in time for the onslaught by the human invaders who want their land. Between sessions, Jake Sully comes out of his dream state and reports on what he is learning. The beauty of the film is in the sequences in which Jake, in his 'avatar' persona among the Ni'va, experiences their world and learns their customs. Their world is unsettling and dangerous to us, but once Jake gets used to his new, blue body and its powers, we get used to the idea that he isn't going to fall to his death. He comes to love his adopted Pandorans (and one in particular), to the point that when the crunch comes, he finds a way to stand with them and help rally them in their defense. This movie is unique in its execution (the best effect is probably the 3D computer screens used for Jake's latter-day YouTube video logs), but the story has several identifiable antecedents. In the depiction of human aggression and ruthlessness, of course one thinks of the history with Native Americans, our extermination of many species, and even perhaps our involvement with exotic earthbound populations like the Vietnamese or Afghans. There are definite parallels with Cameron's own 'Aliens', like the immoral businessman who sells his soul for a buck-- and the casting coup of Sigourney Weaver in the role of a linguist/scientist who tried to understand and help the Ni'va. I saw elements of 'Dune' in the transformation of our hero into a near-deity, and the strong culture of the natives (and saw at the film's end that the production company is called 'Dune Entertainment'). A bit more obscure, but even closer parallel, is to a classic sci-fi novella from the '70's by Ursula LeGuin called 'The Word for World is Forest', which I suggest for some closer study. I wonder whether Cameron himself knows the story and acknowledges the many similarities...So why do I rate this movie an 8 out of 10, if I acknowledge its extraordinary quality for a movie of its type? My objections are three: 1) There is a fundamental flaw around the date of the story; it is necessary to make it soon, in order to make the existential dilemma of this human society believable, but it is impossible to believe that we can achieve interstellar travel and some of the other technological marvels so soon. One could suggest that the people could travel in suspended animation for hundreds of years to get to another solar system, and that they could have continuity in their way of thought to then, but not that the social dilemma could be so protracted that the voyage would have immediate value (nor the short-term profit motives that are cited). 2) The love story between Jake/Avatar and the Ni'va woman is not really necessary for the plot, nor is it totally believable. I see it as being a way to make the movie more palatable for women, a very successful device he used in 'Titanic' to great commercial effect. 3) The view of humanity is so unredeemably negative that it leaves a bad taste. Another reference one cannot avoid is to 'The Lord of the Rings' (large-scale special effect fantasy epic), but here we are the Dark Lord, the agents of Mordor. Let's just hope that dystopian visions like this one will inform humanity when we finally go a-calling into the universe. The ending, I'll just say, is satisfying--if we buy into the story--and 'eye-opening'.",8,1,5,19 December 2009
Groundhog Day," Funny and deep
","I saw this again after 10 years or more had passed since my last viewing, and my appreciation of it--particularly the writing--grew enormously. I had given it 7 stars back then, but I've upped it to 9.This time around, I see the movie as being about two things: 1) how hard it can be to get laid properly; and 2) the eternal recurrence (see Nietzsche--'Thus Spake Zarathustra,' and elsewhere). The idea is, we should live our life as though it will be repeated, again and again, forever. If that were true, and we knew it, we would strive to make the day perfect in every way. Then, how much better all our lives would be!Why not 10 of 10, then? What the movie lacks is any self-reflection at all. The ideas are there, but because they are presented in the context of a silly idea, and because Bill Murray's excellent performance--the very essence of character development--proceeds only through crude trial, error, and more trial and error, then it takes us repeated viewings to get the point. Another qualm, somewhat minor, is that the piano teacher whom Bill Murray takes on late in the story somehow takes credit for his miraculous development as a jazz pianist: if she is like all the other characters in the story (except Murray), she has only known him for one day and could hardly think that she had taken him from rank beginner to polished professional performer in a single day. I think that by this point in the story, the writers and audience were both getting a bit weary of painstaking plot and character development and were asked to take on sudden change without question.",9,2,4,8 January 2012
