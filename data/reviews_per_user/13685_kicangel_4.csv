The Blair Witch Project," Boring, Boring, Boring!
","This is one of the most boring, dull, tedious films i have ever seen. It is not atmospheric, it is not scary, it is not interesting.
I had the unfortunate displeasure of going to see this film at the cinema, on the big screen in the dark. It had no effect on me at all.The plot, which in itself had potential, was mishandled. It was arranged the same way a kid making a home-movie would do it. At one point in the film i found myself wondering what on earth some props were supposed to be. I was completly unimpressed with a film that i was hoping would scare me into having nightmares. All it did was help me get some much needed gossip out of my system. This film is boring, boring boring! Stupid (who would throw away the map and keep the camera rolling) and dull! I know some people have found it scary and 'exciting', but in my opinion there are much better films out there. Even the sometimes stupid actions of teenagers in slasher films are more entertaining than this film. See it if you must, but i would recommend you watch paint dry instead.",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
Armageddon," stroke of genius (absolute!)
","This film is the greatest ever (note not kicangel writing she thinks it's LOTR, we differ in opinion) I however, view this as a amazing. The characters,the music,the story wow! Bruce Willis was just perfect for the part of Harry Stamper was I can't even seperate the two myself! the characters were really well built up I really felt and cared about what happened to them Rockhound is another favourite with his slick comments and genious lines.A real tearjerker and a great action movie there's something for everyone in this movie which keeps you entertained throughout.   Wicked soundtrack too-not for the emotionally unstable!",Null,1,2,3 February 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," WOW! *minor spoilers*
","*spoilers*This is a brilliantly fabulous film. Harry Potter and The Chamber Of Secrets is as good as the book. It keeps so closely to the story, and at some parts i could even see and hear the words and descriptions from the book.This is a very exciting, suspenseful, extremley funny film. I mean it is very funny - Rupert Grint did really well on these parts (as did the rest of the cast), especially when faced with an army of spiders.The whole cinema laughed at the same time during the funny scenes (v. good sign). Kenneth Branagh is really absolutely perfect as Gilderoy Lockhart. He is hilarious, just great. As was Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle. Instead of naming everyone I'll just say that everyone was great, all the right people were chosen. And whoever said that some the actors don't look the age they're supposed to be is wrong. They all look around the age they're supposed to be (which is because they are).Overall, this is a much better film than the last one (which was also great). I think this is definately one to see more than once at the cinema. I loved it. Especially the end when Harry is fighting the Basilisk and the Heir of Slytherin. I just wish they had kept the Deathday Party and Valentines Day from the book, but i understand why they didn't, and it didn't effect the story.I say that this is sooo the must see film, it's five stars no matter what age you are (though very young children might get freaked out by certain eight-legged chase scenes). GO SEE THIS FILM! I can't wait to see it again, or for the next one. (I have just one question, who's going to play Dumbledore, Lupin and Black?)",Null,0,0,9 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Amazing! All i expected and more...(warning may contain spoilers)
","This has to be one of the greatest films i have ever seen. I loved it. I cried about seven times through it, laughed many more times, and spent the entire film wide eyed and amazed. The acting was fabulous, and in my opinion moving and captured the essence of the characters perfectly (esp Elijah Wood & Sean Astin). I know that a lot of people have been complaining that Orlando Bloom isn't in this film much, nor is John Rhys-Davis. But the film doesn't really need them, not in the way the other two did. The battles are fabulous and have well outshone Helms Deep. Shelob was scary, (at least i think it was for the arachnophobe who dug her nails into my arm when she was on the screen.) As a huge fan of the book (yeah it won the Big Read)i did notice the changes. In my opinion they were not unsatisfactory. For the film version they were perfect. I mean i wouldn't change one word in the book, but parts such as when both Pippen and Merry go to battle felt right and were very pleasing. I can see what people mean when they talk about the ending, with blacking to other scenes, but for my this only prolonged the suspense and happy ending feeling. It didn't ruin the film for me, but maybe that's because i've read the book. The only fault is a small one, and a personal one, I would have liked to have seen the blooming of love between Faramir and Eowyn - it's not a big thing, and doesn't ruin the film, but unless you've read the book it goes from one set of circumstances for them, to another. Overall i found this the greatest film i have seen, maybe even ever. All i can say is that if what Peter Jackson took out is half as good as what he left in, then i cannot wait for the Extended DVD! Go see it, or miss out on a cinematic masterpiece. (PS - I hear that this has missed out on the a big hunk of hype and nominations to Cold Mountain. Oh i do wonder why so very much!)",10,0,0,20 December 2003
