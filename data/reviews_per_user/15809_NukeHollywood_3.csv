Ford v Ferrari," Cliches and dumb fun for the rubes
","I've never taken Christian Bale for a great actor. His appeal is for people who enjoy some kind of technical perfection and fake authenticity over substance. His performance should keep rubes occupied, thinking they have witnessed something genuine, an example of what acting is supposed to be.Moving on to the story. Naturally, much of this didn't happen. The pitting of big corporatist Ford Motors against Miles the humble car racer was all made up and I guessed it while watching the film - they just put these cliches in knowing that millions of not so bright members of the public will never get tired how many thousands of times they have experienced these tropes. Anything to get people punching their fists in the air and rooting for their hero. Read the facts of the Miles story if you care at all.The only real recommendable parts of the film and the reason I bothered seeing it, were the racing scenes which are thrilling. The rest, acting, plot are still somewhere on the starting line.",3,9,26,29 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Rise of Rocky Balboa
","Yep it's true Rocky is back for another bout in the ring ... oh excuse me, I meant to say Elvis Presley. Yes, Elvis did die in 1977 but they can bring anyone back. They can keep this series going indefinitely, and I await Episode X, a decade from now where Elvis or Anakin or Rocky will fight the Sith somewhere in Afghanistan till they almost perish in the 'end'.The introduction of Palpatine into the story in the very last film is desparate, tedious etc. Same as Han Solo's treatment in the very first sequel. They have no story, no inspiration, no vision. They don't care, they need a product. Purpose if any comes later, and it never did.It doesn't have the grandeur of the six Star Wars films, visually the sequels are dull, dark and grungy like most movies of the present.At the end of three movies I am still emotionally unconnected to Rey, Finn and Poe. They look and feel like no name people. Some say the sequels are more emotional than the previous six. I don't know, there's been an emphasis, of loving your enemies ... but then Luke did that too. They just expanded on that. I liked Last Jedi but cannot remember how much in comparison to this one. Force Awakens: rubbish. I think the prequels were mostly the best, visually, acting wise and story.Someone else said that this was a movie by committee, which is true, but then went on to complain that he felt persecuted as if the makers were calling him a Russian, misogynist racist dinosaur. No, not at all. Things need to move on in terms of social equality and there's no need to get defensive about something approaching equal screen time for all of us. The 'activism' was light compared to other films.I say these movies did not need to exist. This was the story of Anakin Skywalker who brought balance to the force.We are all wasting time and energy watching this stuff as OUR lives slowly ebb away in a dark theatre. Now that's the dark side of the force.",4,1,1,20 December 2019
The Shape of Water," World and movie audience gets (even) dumber
","The trailers didn't make it clear this was going to be such a romance film. I was wary about the 'magical realism' which these directors do terribly but still decided to give it a chance. Given the sadly increasing numbers of people with poor standards, they make these movies with its simplified, preachy politics which appeals to these simpletons.It's making these already dumb people even dumber. Hollywood needs to straight up wiped off the face of this planet.",2,45,91,3 March 2018
