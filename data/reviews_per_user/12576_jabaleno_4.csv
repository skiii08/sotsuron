Angels & Demons," I lost a lot of respect for Ron Howard after watching this.
","We all know that rarely does a movie truly live up to the book. In this case, it looks like they forgot to read more than the back of the dust jacket before making the movie.Removing some main characters, eliminating the major themes of the story, letting people live instead of die.... I tell you, I have truly lost a lot of respect for Ron Howard's films after this one.Starting with the elimination of Max Koehler, making the Hassassin look like someone out of Middle America instead of the Middle East (that's just historical fact, nothing else), who's Richter and where did Rocher go? Robert Langdon was awakened by an early morning phone call and fax of a brand applied to a physicist/priest, not interrupted during a swim by the Vatican PD with a fax.....That's just the beginning. I can honestly say that I have NEVER been so disappointed in a film adaptation before. I actually liked the film version of Da Vinci Code, but this one won't even get purchased in the bargain bin.",2,0,2,2 May 2010
John Wick," It's John Wick-ed good!!
","Yeah, corny title for a review of a very not corny movie. I knew going in that it was going to be a solid frame of gratuitous violent action, and I was not disappointed. I've re-watched this movie a number of times and I love it every single time. I hate the dog killing scene (as I have dogs of my own) but root for him the entire time he takes his violent vengeance (as is completely justified and should anyone ever harm one of my dogs, they should expect similar response from me ;) ) but it honestly makes the plot so much more. It actually engenders an emotional investment from the audience, as they cheer on John in his quest to avenge his fallen pet.The best part though, is the fact that Keaneau Reeves actually understands what he is doing and it shows. That little bit of authenticity (there's video of him training for this on YouTube, and he does it every bit as well as the pros do) just takes this movie up and over the edge to awesome!!There's not a lot to think about here, but when you just want a nice chill evening with no deep thoughts, this movie will definitely work, and it won't put you to sleep.",10,5,10,24 April 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Well crafted story, well portrayed on screen
","So, this isn't your parents' Star Wars. The first movie I ever saw in theaters was Episode 4, A New Hope. It was 1977 and I was at the ripe old age of 5. This event forever created in me a passion for the franchise. I preface this review with that statement for a reason. I had to watch this movie twice to really get the story. Not for anything done wrong on the part of those who made the movie, but more because I had gotten very use to seeing a certain set of characters in Star Wars movies to this point. This movie is well written and works within the boundaries set with the previous movies to maintain continuity, but with a whole different set of characters. It's like taking your favorite sitcom and making it from the neighbors' point of view. This is not a bad thing, but if you walk in expecting the usual, you will be disappointed. Go in expecting to see a 'fleshing out' of the Star Wars Universe, as it were, and you will be satisfied if not happy.After two viewings, this is definitely heading for my collection and will be viewed more times until I can recite lines from it as well as I can from the rest of the collection (I have destroyed VHS tapes by how often they get watched, digital is my savior).Overall, two thumbs up, ten stars, standing ovation and whatever else you want to toss in there for good measure. I liked it, then I loved it. Go watch it now!!",10,3,9,23 April 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," If anything, a little more Wick-ed than the first
","Honestly, when I heard this movie was coming out, I wasn't 100% sold on it. After all, how can you really top the first?Well, they did. I do need to qualify this though, the recasting of Keaneau Reeves and the fact that the dog survived made it a worthy successor to the first.Keaneau knows how to do the moves and has legitimately trained in the tactical arts. That is what really makes this so much more than 'just another high body count action movie'. His ability to move like he was actually trained (because he was) takes this series to a whole new level.He pours his heart and soul into this franchise and it works. Again, not a whole lot of plot for you to think about, but a sublime level of action, body count and a little bit of the quirk Mr. Reeves is known for make this a phenomenal sequel, and one that I will be watching again.",10,1,3,25 April 2017
