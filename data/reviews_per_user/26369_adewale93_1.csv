Scarface," Scarface stinks
","This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. First of all, Scarface was Al Capone's nickname. Stone apparently wanted to lure in viewers who were interested in seeing a drama on Al Capone's life. Instead, they were surprised to see an idiot who couldn't control his urges and ends up getting killed by his own greed. Along the way he marries a woman only interested in spending his money (really smart dude) and associates with a bunch of idiots in plaid polyester pants.This story was so phony and predictable. I must say though it is a good comedy and provides a lot of laughs with the horrible accents and absurd plot.",1,18,40,28 February 2005
