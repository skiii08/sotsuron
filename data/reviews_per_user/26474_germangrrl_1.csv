Howl's Moving Castle," A triumph in animation!
","In the many years I have been watching Japanese animation (and all types of animation for that matter) I have never seen a film so engaging, so delightful and so thoroughly enchanting as 'Howl's Moving Castle'! I can only recommend this movie to young and old alike. Being a purist, I cannot watch it in the dubbed English version, but even in that form, it is a treasure! Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch all of his movies! While you're at it, watch all the Studio Ghibli movies! Whether you are a purist like me or a novice to Japanese animation, you will love these films! I can think of no better introduction to the world of Japanese animation than a movie from Studio Ghibli! Long live Miyazaki-sama and may he make many more such wonderful movies for his fans all over the world!",10,3,5,9 April 2006
