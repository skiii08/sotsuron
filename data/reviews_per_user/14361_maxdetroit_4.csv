Alien 3," Check out the Directors Cut
","Well, I usually don't say this, but for this movie it's true: The directors cut, special edition, or whatever you call it (it's a raw version of Fincher that the producers refused) is much much better then the 'original' version we had to see at the cinemas. First, it is longer. It has more atmospheric scenes, that let you get a better feel of the emptiness and coldness of that prison planet. Then there is an important part of the movie where they manage to catch the alien. The producer in the 'making of' says that they didn't want that, because it would reduce the danger of the alien. They took the whole part out of the movie - that was a totally wrong decision in my opinion. In part one (Ash) as well as in part two (Burke) exists a traitor who sabotages the whole thing and in part three that is Golic. In this way it fits perfectly well into the series, and the scene where Golic frees the alien is just magnificent. After all, in this version everything fits better together, it takes more time to develop the whole thing (especially the atmosphere - what is always really important to me) and it has more nice references to its predecessors. So my rating for the normal version would be 6 out of 10. But the new cut would be a 8 in my opinion. But, after all it's a just really good horror/science fiction movie.",8,4,44,26 March 2008
Ratatouille," I really cried on this one
","Well, I liked the previous Pixar movies pretty much. But I cried like a baby on this one. And I am a 28 year old guy, and I like rambo 4 and I hear heavy metal stuff like slipknot. But this movie really got me. Well, I think I should just say a big: 'thanks!' to the guys at Pixar. Your movies are so ridiculous heart-touching, they gave me back trust in humanity for at least a month. And this is by no means a sarcastic statement. Really, wonderful movie. So, I don't want to say anything more, but I have to fill the rest of the 10 lines. Well, if you have one thing in your life you are somehow passionate about, keep going, against all odds. This is what this movie told me, and I think the message so god damn right.",9,1,2,29 February 2008
The Fountain," Well, what does this film give me?
","To be honest, I wanted to like the film and I was eager to see it, because I loved Requiem for a Dream and I liked Pi. But, I didn't like it that much because I disagree with the philosophical outcome of this movie. And, there was no humor at all in this movie. Only people crying all the time. The main message is to accept death, because it is the beginning of new life and you don't have to fight or fear it. And also that death is a necessary part of life itself. Okay, that may be one way to deal with death. But: Well, first of all, I think the best way to deal with death is with humor and a grin on my face. Second, I don't want to die anyway, even if a nice tree would come out of my bones. I would like to be a vampire who sucks the blood of other people until the end of time. ;)",5,2,4,10 August 2007
Annihilation," A modern Stalker
","Who wants to see a down to earth Sci Fi movie in a traditional sense is wrong here. This movie is a reminiscent of the movie 'Stalker' where a group of men goes into a mysterious forbidden zone to find a room where wishes get granted.Here we have a group of women who venture into a mysterious zone, and they are looking for a lighthouse, and every one has their own individual wishes, problems and motives. But the journey here is also more a test of the mind then anything else. So in conclusion the movie deals more with psychological issues about identity, changes, and self destruction tendencies than with action scenes and survival.On the surface it may look like a traditional Sci Fi movie, but like Stalker or Odyssee 2001 it has a lot of layers that are open to the interpreation of the viewer. For Example: You could see it as a metaphor of the relationship of Lena and Kane that was tested by a an affair. And while Kane (in a psychological way) was broken and changed and turned into a differnet person after this affair, Lena stayed in her identity but had a hard fight with herself. But this is just one possible interpreation of one layer of the movie and it may be totally far-fetched. But I believe this movie wants to be open for different views and interpreations, without tellling you what is right or wrong.",7,2,5,15 March 2018
