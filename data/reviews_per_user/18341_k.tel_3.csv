Raiders of the Lost Ark," mi fa sol dóóóó, re mi fáááá!!!
","Wow !!! This has to be the best movie ever made... It immediately  starts with a superb breathtaking scène which most movies don't even have as an end climax. And from there on it only gets better. It never falls into clichés and never looses your attention. It's hard to find a movie that truly sucks you in, and keeps you caught till the very end. Great story, beautiful scenarios, incredible acting by all main and secondary actors, and wonderful music with a very catching theme. A true *MASTERPIECE* !",Null,0,0,9 August 2001
Man on the Moon," Utter crap!
","I just finished watching this movie, and it left me feeling so empty and unsatisfied, it makes me feel sick. Let me state clear that I didn't know who Andy Kaufman was, but now I've seen this movie I'm sure I don't WANT TO know who Andy Kaufman was. The main character doesn't win any sympathy during the film. It's sad that a brilliant comedian like Jim Carrey plays a person that's way less funny than he himself is. I really really really don't understand the high rating of this movie. It NEVER made me laugh...NEVER!",1,9,18,10 January 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," You know what? I didn't like it!
","I wasn't planning to comment on this movie, but after reading nothing but good from all the others, I decided to give you my opinion anyway. The story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. There isn't any tention-building or climax whatsoever. The movie just stops after 2 hours. There is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. The only character that has won my sympathy is Han Solo,(Harrison Ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and noone seems to care about him anymore. Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. On the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. Unbelieve what effort George and his guys have done!6 out of 10",6,1,9,16 August 2001
