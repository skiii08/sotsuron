The Monuments Men," Nothing wrong with it
","What surprised me with this is that this quite incredible story has never been made into a film before & this must be one of the last half way decent WW2 films to be made. Being both entertaining and at times amusing this was also educational. While stories have been told of the kind of theft we saw here, going on, the amount of it was staggering! If you start to think what would have happened if this rescue hadn't occurred then you would realise that most of it would have been destroyed by the fleeing Germans or ended up in the hands of the Russians. The scene (spoiler alert) where stacks of paintings are literally blow torched is hard to watch.The film itself has the feel of 'war movies' of earlier years (including the music) but that's what was intended. I enjoyed it and thought the cast Clooney picked for his film was spot on. Someone suggested this would have made a good mini-series or TV series where the story could have been more in-depth and perhaps one day that might happen. But for a 2hour movie I didn't find anything wrong with it. I'm just glad the story was told...",9,3,5,18 March 2014
Valkyrie," Superb Film!
","I want to say right off that I think this is easily Tom Cruise's best performance. But this film also had a supporting cast of some of the best of British acting talent. Not being aware previously of this piece of WW2 history I was fascinated & entertained with the brilliant production that this film turned out to be. It's a good thing we don't take too much notice of the nay-sayers! This is a very, very good movie. If any of Stauffenburg's family are still alive today ie/ children or grandchildren I hope they are proud of what this man, and others that supported him, tried to do. And it's nice to know that in all the Nazi evil & insanity there were those who could see the wrong in it & the ruination of their country and tried to put an end to it.",10,3,5,23 January 2009
