Hereditary," I was tricked by the rating. What is this injustice?
",Two hours of my life I will never get back. I'd be pretty mad if I didn't have a moviepass.. but wow. The acting was a bit ridiculous (especially the boy) and the story line was dumb... The ending was downright laughable. I found myself laughing more than I felt any kind of thrill. I'm not sure who is reviewing this one... but it's extremely lame. I'm usually a big wuss when it comes to scary movies and this one just had me bored or looking at my husband while we both laughed about how bad it was. A guy next to us walked out part way through.. he was onto something there. I should have followed! I don't recommend it if you're paying full price.,1,4,9,2 July 2018
