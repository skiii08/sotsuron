The Blair Witch Project," Definitely worth seeing---but.....
","While I really enjoyed watching The Blair Witch Project, the experience would have been far better in an empty theatre. To become completely absorbed in the events on screen, there really needs to be utter silence in the theatre.  Unfortunately, crowds in Baltimore haven't totally mastered the art of staying quiet during a film.  That said, Blair Witch works much better if you take the events onscreen as factual.  Actually, even knowing that it is fictional does not detract from the experience too much, but it's certainly far more frightening if taken as reality.  In some sense, the movie reminded me of Michael Powell's masterpiece Peeping Tom, made in the early sixties.  Both films were far more frightening in a psychologically realistic way than in a gore/shock way.  Blair Witch seemed as much a consideration of how we view films as an out and out horror film. It's quite short, and upon the fairly abrupt ending (which was perfectly fine by me), many people in the theatre said quite loudly, 'That's IT?!?' Granted, it's impossible to escape idiots in society, but I would still highly recommend the film, only in a far more empty (or mature) theatre than the one in which I saw it.",8,1,2,25 July 1999
The Shining," A horror classic
","This film works so well because it is not only a very successful horror film, it is also a knowledgeable homage to previous horror films. Similarly, one can sit back silently and become absorbed in the narrative (in which case, the movie is terrifying), or one can view the film as a comedic piece (it is a VERY funny work of art).  The film runs a bit too long and could have easily omitted at least 15 or 20 minutes of needless footage, but it is still extremely entertaining and thought-provoking (deconstructing the film leads to interesting results!).",10,0,0,9 June 1999
Gladiator," Maybe it's the genre, but this movie was awful
","I thought the film was atrocious.  Part of this was the mobmentality that pervaded the college theatre where I saw it, withhordes of frat boys cheering and applauding at the goriestscenes.  Do they not realize they are just like the Romans inthis sense? I couldn't believe some of the dialogue that wasallowed to come out of characters' mouths.  Some of the specialeffects were interesting, particularly the construction of theColiseum, but the sped-up look of the scenes was extremelyirritating.  This film just seemed thoughtless and predictable,while not particularly entertaining or insightful.  Definitelynot worth 2 1/2 hours or $8 for the price of ad",3,0,3,4 May 2000
