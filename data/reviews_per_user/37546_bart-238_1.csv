Marie Antoinette," Waste of time
","I wasn't very excited about this movie to begin, but Ebert said it was good and I was doing nothing else, so I went. It was absolutely horrible. Pretty scenery, but nothing else. The plot was non-existent, the dialog was non-existent, and there was no message as far as I can tell.The first hour of the film tried to drive home the point that the 2 did not consummate their marriage for several years. Most of us knew that going into the film; those who did not surely got the point after 15 minutes and had to wait around for 45 minutes before the first plot event occurred.",1,1,4,29 October 2006
