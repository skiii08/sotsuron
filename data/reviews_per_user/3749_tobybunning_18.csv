Scarface," This Is Greed at Its Finest.
","Tony Montana: In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women.Scarface is pretty much the perfect film of showing someone who went from doing a one time job to leader of a drug cartel, and completely losing his mind over paranoia and greed, and it is one of the best showings of how your mind will go from one to the other.Al Pacino completely destroys it here playing Tony Montana to the point where its has always been compared which was his better performance as a gangster between his performance as Tony Montana or Michael Corleone. In a small comparison if you look at Tony Montana when he is at his highest point he has more charisma and is more flamboyant and when he needs to be he can be seriously more violent (hence the famous quote) whereas with his performance as Michael Corleone he is more subtle, calculating and crafty gangster.As the film goes on you can see Tony Montana succumb more and more to greed and this is where the violence of the character kicks in with the most memorable quote 'say hello to my little friend' . This quote has also become a cult classic as it has been made reference to by countless films including kids films.Overall an easy 10/10",10,0,0,26 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overall could be worse
","Personally I have nothing against The Phantom Menace, when I used to watch it I used to have a light sabre and pretend to be a Jedi when the fights were going on. To me it's just not a good film for kids because the story is just to grown up for them to follow. So for them the highlights are going to be the battles and the podrace 1/2 way through. The acting overall I would say was just 'meh could be a lot better'.Some of the characters were insane in terms of being cool to kids like Darth Maul or Qui Gon Jinn or Obi Wan Kenobi but some are just flat out boring like Anakin Skywalker or Padme but none of the characters beat the iconically poor Jar Jar Binks.Other things the film got right were the fact that it extended the galaxy from the planets we saw in The Original Trilogy and the musical score. But like I have said before the main things the film has got wrong are the story as it wasnt great for kids, the pacing, most of the characters and the writing.But if you are a Star Wars fan it's still a solid film to the Star Wars Prequel trilogy",8,0,2,10 May 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Will stand the test of time
","I Personally think this is one if not the best one of Speilberg's most classic films.This film vs The Last Crusade is a tough fight in terms of whats better but i would say this film ...just... nicks it it term of a better film. When I saw it as a child I fell in love with it. Little bit of classic belief ( X marks the spot). the times when it scary in terms of the skeletons did do their job but thought they weren't enough to give people nightmares (personal opinion, could be incredibly wrong) just a piece of advice if your scared of snakes this might be a film that you might think about avoiding.One of Harrison Ford's best performances easily on par with his Han Solo performance.",10,1,2,15 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Solid Round 2 after Infinity War
","Just to give you some advice anyone who is thinking about seeing this film they need to watch the past Avenger films from the start.The storyline might be a little bit of getting used to but overall it is still a great plot for a Avengers film. After the end of Infinity War it was good to see how the characters had moved on and how the world is picking up the pieces of what had happened. When the sh*t goes down in terms of the action it really is on par and in some aspects beats Infinity War in terms of the diversity and the use of what each character is shown to do.
Overall a solid Avengers Film",10,1,2,26 April 2019
Saving Private Ryan," A films closest portrayal of the horrors
","After playing so many video games about WW2 it is incredible how the games capture only a piece of how WW2 was in comparison to this film which is incredibly accurate of how the soldiers had to deal with both the pain and torture of the war and mentally how it affected them as well. There is a reason why this film is classed as a Rated R film.The plot follows a group of soldiers which are ordered to locate a private and return him home, over the course of the film you see this band of soldiers form a bond between them to the point where you could class them as a band of brothers that help each other through the horrors they see.Steven Spielberg's directing of this film shows why he is a master in film-making, If he didn't win that Oscar for best director for this film it would be an absolute crime, in my opinion I would class this film in the top 10s of IMBD top 250 films not 27. To say that Tom Hanks who plays the lead role in the film did a brilliant role in portraying his character is a sheer understatement, the emotion his character has during the film is easily seen and it hits you hard.The battles that the film shows is not shown as winning one town after another and moving on, they are a much more accurate portrayal of the war by showing it as the soldiers winning it street by street with each one being as hard fought to gain as the last. The way the towns are shown in this film being bombed and turned into just a pile of rubble is a great way of showing what the towns during WW2 were actually like. The cinematography in this film is brilliant and the sound editing perfectly captures the fear that was felt in WW2.To class this film as just a film about WW2 is incredibly wrong, it is the closest depiction as to WW2 was actually like, and the closest to the terror the soldiers had to face, it is a masterpiece of a film.",10,1,2,20 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Insane
",Personally thought it was a great film. Bit over rated for No 9 of all films on IMDB but none the less great. Thanos was the best character due wrath for the stones. excellent fight scenes. Nice bringing more Marvel characters in to expand depth of universe. Overall a solid Marvel Avengers film.,9,1,3,1 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not the worst.. cough 'Attack of the Clones' not the best .. cough 'Empire Strikes Back'
","It has its pros 
Luke shown as a proper emotionally damaged man.Lust for power between characters well shown (to a certain point)Special effects were good but not greatCons
Plot was unfocusedRelationships between characters not relatably shown.Certain scenes not needed at all.Overall 5/10
Meh could be worse could be a lot better.",5,5,9,2 May 2018
The Imitation Game," Has its moments where it will hit your heart
","The thing is when people think of WW2 they think of well known and well documented parts such as the Battle of Berlin, The dropping of the first atomic bomb (Little Boy), The concentration camps such as Auschwitz. All of these parts of WW2 are well known by everyone. But there are parts of WW2 that need to be acknowledged and given credit for.This film is based around the fact that during WW2 the Germans had developed a code machine that they used to communicate with its army and every 24 hours it would reset itself and change to another.So failure after failure of having pretty much an army of people taking a wild guess of trying to crack it by hand Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) stated that he was going to develop a machine (The Bombe) that would crack the code daily as it needed to.The acting within this film and the actors who played their roles was pretty much perfect. Benedict Cumberbatch played Alan Turing incredibly well as well as Alex Lawther and you could see how their presentation of the character were very similar to one another. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke was done well as well as Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander.The Plot was actually very easy to keep up with and was always able to keep your curiosity.Overall if you are someone who is interested in certain aspects of WW2 this is definitely something to learn from",10,0,1,2 July 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Admittedly not accurate, But still a lovely family film.
","Rahd Dahl was always one of my favourite authors growing up so when I found out this film was coming out I was looking forward to it,
Tim Burton did a great job in directing this film, it just needed to be a little bit more accurate to the book.The acting was good especially by Freddie Highmore (Charlie) as well as Johnny Depp (Willy Wonka),who I feel really feel they went out of their
way in order to represent their characters as they should be
Everyone else acted the way their characters should have been and they presented their characters very well.
The special effects were pretty great as well when it came to how each of the types of sweets were made to look.",8,1,3,26 February 2020
Logan," Sad is a serious understatement
","I always knew from the trailer it was going to be sad and in my opinion it was time for Marvel to take a new turn with their films about Wolverine. After watching the trailer and hearing 'Hurt' by Johnny Cash it just hits even more on the way this film is going be. The acting is pretty much on the verge of perfect. Hugh Jackman pretty much plays a Wolverine that has almost given up on everything but when he needs to be the old Wolverine we get hit with a bit of nostalgia as he can be incredible brutal at times but when fighting you can tell he doesn't have much of the original Wolverine in him anymore and they show that incredibly well. Patrick Stewart plays a Charles Xavier that has a new 'power' being the shape of seizures that affect everything around him and so relies of Logan even more to control them. Laura plays her role as a bad tempered teenager who for the most of the film just sits there and scowls, and will not hesitate to throw down over the smallest of things and the way she represents the character is on par with the way Hugh Jackman played the original Wolverine.Overall I am surprised that this film is not featured higher on the IMDB top 250 Rated Films. In my opinion this deserves to be at least in the top 50 area.",10,4,7,16 November 2018
The Dark Knight," Batman at his finest
","The Dark Knight had a serious standard to be on par with as people will compare it the Batman Begins but the way it was more complex and progressive plot as well as building of the characters just beats Batman Begins easily. Batman Begins showed a lot more action whereas the Dark Knight showed a lot more intelligent as well as subtle ways to carry the plot.Christian Bale plays a Batman that is on par and at some points beats the character in Batman Begins. When he needs to think like a criminal and understands their plans he takes them down with ease.
Michael Caine is still the classic Alfred and plays his role superbly as well as .Gary Oldman as Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox . Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Rachel effortlessly but in my opinion doesn't have the same connection with Bruce Wayne as in Batman Begins. But the stand out performance is definitely Heath Ledger as The Joker. In preparation for his role he spent a month in a hotel room just focussing on The Joker's laugh. To say he played The Joker well is a serious understatement, he is the definition of a psychopath and one of the highlights of playing his role was the 'Magic Trick' he easily deserved the Oscar.This film deserves to be in the top 5 most rated,",10,0,1,16 November 2018
Joker," Oh my days
","I have always just thought The Joker being in his mindset from day 1 of being born, I never thought of him turning into his well known character over a period of time. Joaquin Phoenix really embraced the role of The Joker and delivered a performance that is on par and in some respects surpasses Heath Ledger's version. Let's face it everyone who sees this film is going to be comparing it to Heath Ledger's classic portrayal.The psyche of The Joker has always been a huge question mark and Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job in creating a version of how he came to be in the iconic character that we know today. After the scene where he murders the 3 men on the train you seriously see how Arthur Fleck goes from a man who just a nice everyday person who has taken some harsh hits from society to Gotham's Clown Prince of Crime and how he transcends from one to the other. To use another example people often judge a person's performance of The Joker with their laugh as it is one of his iconic traits. It had never crossed my mind that he could have developed this trait from a head injury and therefore at some points it was hard not to feel sorry for him when it happened at a bad time. The pace of which Joaquin Phoenix creates his character change into The Joker was at a slow pace and as the film went on you see him go deeper and deeper into the mindset and it just grips you the more it went on.In the end Joaquin Phoenix's performance is easily in deserves of an Oscar and as said before in my opinion it is on par with Heath Ledger's performance>",10,3,4,20 March 2020
Jaws," Your gonna need a bigger blockbuster film on sharks to beat this.
","First off Jaws is the perfect title for this film. as well as the well known music tune.
One of the reasons why I fell in love with films and since then I have always gone into the sea more slowly when going to the beach.The cast is perfectly done as well as the script with the definitive quotes as 'Your gonna need a bigger boat' and 'Smile your son of a' When I have a get together with my friends we sit down to watch this film before going out because everyone agrees this is one of the best films of the 1970s.in total an easy 10 out of 10",10,1,3,15 June 2019
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Will Always Be A Classic
","When my niece came round saying 'Can we watch a Disney film' I said 'Let's start at the beginning, have you ever seen Snow White'Admittedly after not seeing this film for a good 20 years I forgot how charming and sweet this film really is. The animation of this film for 1937 is just astounding for its time especially when you see the queen transformed into her disguise (scared my niece to the point where she buried her face into a cushion). But it's the characters that really bring this film together, You can easily see why Snow White was the fairest one of all, her voice as well as her animated looks just instantly made you fall in love with her. Then there are the dwarves all were incredibly well designed and voiced ( - Dopey of course). Every one of the dwarves were just so adorable but personally I fell in love with Dopey especially when he tried (and failed) to bring the soap. The Queen however that's different, when she found out she had been lied to and was talking about how she was going to kill Snow White you could not help hating her.Overall as this is officially the first ever full length animated film I am seriously surprised why this has not won any Oscars, Especially as it has paved the way for all animated film afterwards.",10,2,2,15 January 2020
The Lion King," Hands Down 10/10
","Whether your a child or a parent people will class this film is a simple Classic.
The animation of the film is outstanding, the music will make you somewhat emotional, but the storyline is where it's at, I have watched this film repeatedly over the years and each time have always come incredibly close to crying with certain parts of the film. To say this film is a classic is seriously understating on what this film actually is. There is a significant reason why every list of Best Disney Films on the internet have classed this film in its Top 3 if not No1 and there is a Broadway show on this film, if that doesn't give you enough evidence to go and see this film I don't know what will.",10,0,0,8 February 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Shawshank Redemption will always hit your emotions
","There's a reason why this is No 1 in IMDB Why it has taken me so long to see this film is a mystery with people saying 'How have you not seen The Shawshank Redemption' I always thought it was just another film inside a prison so nothing special but after watching it I hold my hands up and admit I should have seen this sooner.The relationships that are built come close to even unbreakable especially between Andy and Red. The writing is well thought and it shows through the script.
The desire of control over inmates from Warden Norton to is nothing short of incredible.I have seen a lot of websites based on The Shawshank Redemption VS The Green Mile over which one will hit you hardest emotionally. But as hard to believe with The Green Mile was when making Michael Clarke Duncan a man with a child's mind and how well the director making it show as well as the writers. But how as much as this is seen as a to be a cornerstone as a drama class of film and how well it is also seen as at is easy to see why this film is a classic and in some people's mind is the better of the two. However as incredibly emotional this film is as a drama and how hard this film will hit you and will leave you heartbroken and emotionally scarred, The Shawshank takes the lead. admittedly not by a huge margin but not a close call either.Films based in prisons aren't not exactly my first choice of film and even then the ones I had seen before this minus The Green Mile are ones with over the top and unneeded sexism and are filmed to be aimed at teenagers. Shawshank is aimed to convey both minor and clear messages about a friendship between people either best friends or otherwise. Overall to call this film an absolute classic in all of films and one of the best films to watch doesn't quite give this film justice as to how good it actually is. In my opinion this isn't a film that you may need to see, this a film that you have to see.",10,0,0,3 May 2018
Godzilla," Solid Godzilla Movie
","In the past pretty much all the films have had about Godzilla have had him as our enemy so it was nice to have a change for once. Aaron Taylor-Johnson who was cast as the lead role did a decent job and wasn't made to be a Prince Charming character and his wife played by Elizabeth Olsen wasn't made to be some princess waiting to be swept off of her feet as she was seen to be pretty much the same as everyone else of the support cast in terms of emotion. Ken Watanabe who was cast as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa again did a decent job of playing his role in the film but his assistant was incredibly over emotional at times in the film at times which it was not needed.When the action happened the cities it happened in the cities were pretty much destroyed (as you would expect) so you would see how powerful the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object) and Godzilla were, not to the point where you were on the edge of your seat not wanting to distracted but to be fair the CGI in the film of them fighting was pretty decent in total.Overall a solid Godzilla film with a nice change of direction of how Godzilla was made not to be the enemy but as an ally.",9,0,1,20 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," To call this film a Classic is a serious understatement
","The original Star Wars trilogy will always be classed as a phenomenal masterpiece within the sci-fi genre. But a New Hope was where it all began. The Force (pun intended) that this film created in the sci-fi genre lead it to what it is now. The casting was perfect, and writing/directing was brilliant considering it was done by George Lucas and he will always be remembered for this film. Within the film industry itself one could argue this is called a masterpiece as the technology that was available at the time of this film being produced, I am surprised it is not higher than it ought to be within the IMBD Top Rated Film list.
The characters evolved over time from Luke Skywalker becoming just a small farm boy to destroying at the time the biggest threat in the galaxy and becoming an icon, Han Solo became from just a small time smuggler to one of the best pilots of the Rebellion, and Darth Vader came from just a small boy (the Phantom Menace) to one of the most feared person within the universe, as well as one of the most phenomenal representation of a villian within the sci-fi genre of film.",10,1,1,10 March 2019
