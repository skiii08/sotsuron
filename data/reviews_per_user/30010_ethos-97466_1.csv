First Man," Great music, acting - POOR cinematography
","The relentless 'shaky cam' destroyed the experience for me. Completely unnecessary to have that effect throughout the whole movie, with all dialogues having super close-ups on the face. Just poor directing. Great score, like the movie gravity - carried the narrative. Great acting. Good script.",1,23,42,13 October 2018
