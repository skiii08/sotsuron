Come and See," A Belorussian boy joins the Soviet resistance army against the Germans in WWII.
","This film was so powerful and so stunning in its realism, writing, cinematography, sound and editing that I get chills simply revisiting the film in my mind to write this review. The shots are as beautiful as they are horrifying. What starts as an innocent curiosity transforms into a humbling sequence of terrifying events that push the boundaries of sanity. Despite its intense depictions of human casualties and psychological warfare, the film does end on a redemptive note, and I highly highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in an original film that depicts the resolve of the human spirit in spite of the atrocities and horrors of war.",10,6,8,30 July 2012
