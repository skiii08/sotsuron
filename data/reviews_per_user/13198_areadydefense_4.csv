Blade Runner 2049," Unpacking Blad Runner 2049
","Bladrunner 2049 asks one simple question, 'What does it mean to be human?' Then, it proceeds to offer a variety of possibilities, as seen primarily from the point of view of non-humans, i.e. replicants. Some of the possibilities mentioned include:Giving birth Lying Being born Having a soul Having real memories Sacrificing for othersI'm sure there are others but you get the idea. In the course of the story we're introduced to sentient beings at various levels of humanness. People, replicants, holograms. If that weren't enough, it seems as though there is a human, replicant hybrid and to confuse it even more, there are a variety of generations of replicants.With the question asked and the parties introduced, there is a lot of role reversals and juxtapositions. At one point a human serves a hologram as she tries to please a replicant. That is some serious role reversal. The value of life itself is explored. Replicants are terminated for simple failure (wrong color of eye) or known limitations (inability to reproduce). Niander Wallace wants millions of replicants to serve and can't make them fast enough. Meanwhile, thousands of orphans are shown doing trivial work.A couple of characters really stand out. Joe's holographic companion seems more human than anyone else in the story when she sacrifices everything, seems to have emotion, and much more. Joe, while seeming very stoic in his search for meaning is told by other replicants that sacrificing for others is one of the most human things you can do. So he does exactly that, and he appears to die satisfied that he has come as close to human as possible.This just scratches the surface of an intricate and complex series of questions. I think the real question you should be left with is, 'If sacrificing in the service of others is one of the most human things you can do, how human are you? Do you live a life of giving?' Maybe you didn't catch that question the first time around. I didn't. But it is very definitely in there and worth exploring.",10,6,14,12 October 2017
Knives Out," Southern Accent?
","I don't even care if the movie has a good plot or if the acting is good. Daniel Craig's accent is so bad it's unwatchable. If you are a Yankee and don't know what a southern accent is supposed to sound like, perhaps you could enjoy the movie. My wife and I turned it off after 30 minutes - Simply unwatchable.Never, in the history of moviedom, had anyone botched an accent as badly.",2,2,5,29 June 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Trainwreck
",I was thoroughly disappointed in this film. I grew up reading Thor and loved the first two movies. This was a disaster from beginning to end. The director tried to make it into a comedy and failed miserably. The funny lines weren't funny or memorable and it took away from the action. I will watch for other movies this director works on and avoid them.,5,7,14,21 November 2017
Interstellar," science FANTASY FICTION
","I watched this at home via Netflix. I'm certain it would have gotten another star on the big screen. It was made for it.I enjoyed the first two hours of this movie and plenty of others have already given their accolades so I won't. On to the complaints.Lots left to the imagination (mostly key plot elements) but if they had filled in the blanks this would have been an 8 hour movie.Lots of motives left unexplained. For this type of movie there's no excuse for that. The amount of action apparently didn't leave much time for it.The last 40 minutes or so looked like an alternate ending for 2001 A Space Odyssey. I half expected our hero to look in on an old himself in a hospital bed but it wasn't quite that bad. Still, by the end, we were making 2001 jokes.Good beginning - well executed - lots of action - disappointing ending. Would I recommend it? Not really.",5,1,2,26 December 2015
