The Ring," Questions...
","Saw the movie on satellite the other night, and I thought it was pretty good. I realize that the movie is supposed to leave the viewer with some questions, as not everything (it seems) is clearly explained. A couple of questions, if I may?POSSIBLE SPOILER POSSIBLE SPOILER POSSIBLE SPOILER POSSIBLE SpoilerOK, first question - why didn't the kid and mom (?) die? They both watched the movie, and the mom watched the movie before the guy did - yet the guy died. Second question - why, after burning the original tape, did the mom decide that the surviving copy had to kept?",Null,1,2,23 October 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Just what I expected
","This movie is not for the hard-core fans of either the Alien or Predator series'. If you are wanting a movie that shows a lot of character development and back-story on both of the species, look elsewhere. If you take the Alien or Predator series' too seriously, then again you need to look elsewhere.If you simply like the Aliens and the Predators, but your life doesn't revolve around them, then this is a good movie. I liked it, and I make no apologies. I kept rooting for Aliens, saying (out loud), 'Get 'em Alien... get 'em'. This is what I used to say to my Dalmation when she would get a gopher or something, and I was cracking myself up. The people around me joined in, rooting for their favorite species. It was a lot of NON-SERIOUS fun. It was good way to get out of the heat wave, be entertained, and not have to run my own A/C.",Null,0,0,25 August 2004
28 Days Later...," Comments and answers
","If you like gory, gruesome, mindless slasher flicks, then this movie is not for you.  SPOILER ALERT:  it has been asked why were there dead bodies in the pews of the church.  Well, we know that the main character's parents committed suicide to avoid becomming infected.  Thus, one can assume that many people chose suicide instead of becomming infected, and chose to do so in churches.  Another question was asked, why didn't the infected attack each other.  Simple.  The virus is a primate virus that mutated into a human virus.  Since the infected are very much alive, and are infected with a mutated primate virus, they were most likely able 'sense' who is infected and who is not. Observations: the infected are not dead, they are not zombies, they are just as alive as you and me.  They are just infected with a virus that causes the person to be in a constant, violent, out-of-control, murderous rage.  While I had a few issues with the movie, I liked it.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
