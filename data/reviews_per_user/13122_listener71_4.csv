Hereditary," The only scary thing about Hereditary is just how overrated it was
","Just your typically idiotic B horror movie but with better actors and high production values this time,masquerading as work of art. One day movie should be made about how this piece of trash received such a critical phrase.",1,3,9,11 September 2018
The Hateful Eight," Ridiculous,pointless,disgusting beyond belief
","This movie is like a box,a really well packed box,decoration is very interesting,very intriguing.Gonna take a lot of time to open it-hell gonna take 3 long hours of your life just to find a little piece of turd inside of it.But it's a Quentin Tarantino's turd (although QuenTEEN would be much more appropriate) so movie critics are gonna celebrate this piece of turd and write how great this turd is.Don't be fooled.This movie has lots of qualities for sure-cinematography is great,music as well (Ennio Morricone!),almost all performances from actors are fine too-but the story,OMG...some stories simply don't have a right to be told.",1,165,358,24 December 2015
Get Out," Anti-white racist propaganda
","Not a bad movie itself-kind of interesting,some good acting,cinematography is fine...but story is ridiculous with too many plot holes-10 or so black people are missing all connected to the same white girl and no one finds it a little bit strange? Anyway,this is propaganda piece which makes it worthless in my book.All whites are crazy,all whites are evil,all whites are jealous at black people cause they have better bodies and so on and so on...this movie pretends to be social satire toward racism but it ends like being racist itself.p.s. Microsoft obviously spent some money on this movie and boy it is shown-they are literally everywhere...to see someone actually using Bing as search engine was even more weird then all that brains transplantation stuff!",2,10,19,15 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," More plot holes that one can count
","Well this movie was fun.It's interesting and it surely feels good to revisit Star Wars universe after all this time.Some visuals were quite nice too.Unfortunately this movie was killed by his own screenwriters.Never in my whole life I noticed so many plot holes in any movie.Almost every scene has some kind of mistake,contradiction or something deeply illogical or totally unexplained etc etc.Another Death Star with same weak spot? Luke's lightsaber lost in ep.V magically appears in Maz'cantina? Rey's instant jedism after no training at all? Finn's half-jedism because why not? R2-D2 suddenly turns on after years and years of inactivity? How wrote this thing,a child?",3,142,263,24 December 2015
