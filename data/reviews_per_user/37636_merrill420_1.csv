Hereditary," Hated this movie
","If I could, I would give it 0 stars.Not scary at all. There's no slow burn, and zero scares. Anyone saying this is brilliant or intelligent horror, doesn't know anything about the horror genre. So boring we almost fell asleep in the theater. Don't waste your time watching this movie. Instead go watch a real horror movie like The Exorcist.",1,2,10,6 July 2019
