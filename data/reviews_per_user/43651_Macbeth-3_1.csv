The Blair Witch Project," Prepare to be truly frightened
","I haven't been frightened at a movie since I was 11 years old. The only reason I was even scared then was because I was experiencing my first heavy dose of horror films, and the shocks and gore scenes seemed new and terrifying. Since then, I've seen more horror films than I can count, none of which have even come close to scaring me...until the Blair Witch. This is what horror is all about folks. It's about coming home from the movie and looking over your shoulder because you're afraid of what you can't see. It's about wandering what those noises coming from just beyond your range of vision are. It's about shivering even though it's not really cold. See it, and be scared again.",Null,1,3,30 April 1999
