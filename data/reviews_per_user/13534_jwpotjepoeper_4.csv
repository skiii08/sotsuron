Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," ''Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more no more no more''
","The fourth film in the pirates series isn't something to get excited about. I already thought that the third film wasn't that good, but this one is just as bad.Instead of Orlando bloom and Keira knightley as the other main stars next to captain Jack, we now have Blackbeard and his daughter. Both much worse then their predecessors in the previous films. Blackbeard is suppose to be the ultimate bad guy, but instead he is an old man who tries to be a badass but really fails in doing that. His daughter played by Penelope Cruz had a strange role, you never really know what her backstory is, and her motives for doing what she does are kind of vague. And last but not least Barbossa makes a reappearance in this film. It never really becomes clear why he joined the royal navy, but he does play his role quite well, only I liked him a lot better when he was an actual pirate. And then off course captain Jack himself, well what can you say, Johnny Depp plays this character very well.The other characters in the film include Jack's always trustworthy deckhand Gibbs who delivers a solid performance. Blackbeards priest, who overact his role and is not very believable. Then there's the mermaid who the priest falls in love with for some strange reason. This love is much to quick and unbelievable. And then there's the Spanish, who's role in the film is as weird as can be. You never really understand what there purpose in the film is, they feel completely redundant.The 3D effects of the film aren't that good either. The special effects are decent, but thats the case in almost every high budget film nowadays. The pace in this film is confusing, it starts of in sixth gear and then shift down a gear every 20 minutes. Only to get a little bit exited at the end, but like I sad just a little. Pirates 4 never delivers the adventure and charm of the first film. I wouldn't say that this is a very bad film, it's just not that good, so don't expect to much.",4,0,0,21 May 2011
Avatar," Is it good or is it bad?
","Well to start by answering that question right away, yes its good. But why is it good? Well its good because this movie is more than just a movie it's an adventure.It takes you to a exotic place that you will love more and more as the movie continues. When I watch a movie I don't look at all the details or the story or the characters, I look at the feeling that I get form a movie and I got a really good feeling out of this movie. I know that some people say that this film is all about fancy CGI and that's all there is to this movie.But the reason why this movie is so successful is the feeling that people get when they see this movie, most people get the same feeling I got, it's hard to explain what kind of feeling I got but it was a very positive one. If you watch a movie and your noticing every little thing that's wrong you're not really watching a movie, you have to feel the movie and flow through it and Avatar is a perfect movie to do that.Like to hear your opinions on this, thanks",9,4,7,4 May 2010
Thor," The good, the bad and the ugly
","If you compare Thor with his superhero friends and there films, you come to the conclusion that Thor is better then the incredible Hulk but not as good the first Iron Man film. I gave this film a 7 because it has many good points but also bad points: The Good: <ul><li>Chris Hemsworth is perfect as Thor, in acting, in style in everything </li></ul><ul><li>Thor does feel like he is the strong powerful hero that he is, and is portrait like he is in the comics.</li></ul><ul><li>Special effects are good and the 3D effects give a nice feel to the film </li></ul><ul><li>The humor in the film is funny and not annoying at all </li></ul>The Bad:<ul><li>Not enough action throughout the entire film </li></ul><ul><li>Natalie Portman's acting is decent but she feels out of place in this movie </li></ul><ul><li>The film could have been longer, and feels rushed on the end </li></ul><ul><li>Loki doesn't do that much as the main villain </li></ul>The Ugly: <ul><li>Why does Thor lose his powers? we want to see him with his powers not without, then he's just a normal man thats no fun.</li></ul>All in all Thor is a good film but could have been better. But one thing is for sure, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE AVENGERS!!!!PS: stay after the credits and see a nice bonus",7,3,11,28 April 2011
Prometheus," Nothing happens in this movie, really nothing!
","This was the most boring movie I watched in a long time. Ik really liked the first 2 Alien films, the third Alien movie was OK and the fourth sucked big time, also the 2 AVP movies were very poor. But this is even worse then all of those previous mentioned movies. Nothing ever really happens. And the things that do happen are unexplainable or totally useless. Why was the old Weyland there? What purpose has the tentacle alien baby? Why does nobody ever really panic? What was the real purpose of going to this planet? Why did the alien that they wake kill everybody? Those are just a few questions that have no answers. The movie has good CGI I'll give it that, but that really the only thing its got. No suspense, no real gore, no real scary moments, no good action. This is something that the previous Alien movies did have. I really would like to know what Ridley Scott was thinking when he made this movie, I do know that he wasn't thinking clear. To conclude, a very poor en boring movie! Don't waste 2 hours of your life on it!",1,5,8,26 December 2012
