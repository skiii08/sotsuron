Skyfall," Lacks big robots and lasers to complete the picture
","Granted, Judie Dench tried to play a robot, but it's not enough. How this film can get such a high score is beyond me. Some sorry excuse for a villain concocts mind-boggling convoluted plan that involves hacking all London, blowing up MI6, capturing Bond, then surrendering to Bond, escaping -- all that supposedly to hurt and kill 'M'. I don't suppose he could just walk in her apartment (like Bond did) and simply shoot her. And Bond who gets shot, falls off the train into the abyss, and is even shown drowning, then somehow makes miraculous recovery. I mean, seriously?! Now I realize Bond movies aren't really supposed to be realistic, but this is beyond ridiculous. This was written by an 8 year old for 5 year olds. The idiot plot, poor screenplay, mediocre acting. The action reminded me of Wild Wild West movie with Will Smith, except that WWW was a comedy, and this isn't. I can't believe that I actually got bored watching this.",3,5,7,5 March 2015
Gone Girl," Over-hyped lackluster silliness
","Overall Gone Girl was pretty disappointing considering the hype. The movie is definitely watchable, especially the first half, but then it takes a leap in the realm of absurdity.The cinematography is excellent but that's a given with Fincher. The main characters are rather boring. While I can't say that Ben Affleck's and Rosamund Pike's acting is bad per se, but they both seem to lack screen presence to make themselves interesting and intriguing.The main problem, at least for me, is the lack of genuine suspense. It just fails to grab your interest. Maybe it's because there have been so many movies and shows with the same theme, I don't know. Ben Affleck fails to transition from 'good guy' to 'bad guy' and back. He's just too bland to be either liked or disliked. When the major reveal happens (sometime in the middle), you kind of already know this was going to happen. Maybe not exactly THAT, but definitely something like that. And then it just abandons any common sense, rolls down the hill, hits a cow, and ends with a cliffhanger.I'd say that whether you enjoy this movie will depend on your expectations. If you expect something really clever, don't bother. On the other hand, if you watch it with an empty head and forget about things like logic, you might be entertained... unless you fall asleep. And oh yes, seeing Ben Affleck's junk may cause nightmares, so beware.",5,3,6,2 March 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Garbage chic extraordinaire
","50 Shades of Grey is without a doubt the worst box-office hit that Hollywood has ever produced.It's an (unintentionally) hilarious tale of two dimwitted individuals who have an absurd sex affair. Certain Anastasia Steele, a virginal student, is so horny that she apparently can't figure out that a douchey billionaire Christian Grey who wants to spank her ass, might actually hurt her. So to figure this out, she ASKS him to whip her ass really hard. And when he does, she gets upset and leaves, thus concluding the 'romance'. It's pure comedy gold.None of the characters have any idea why they do or say things, and neither do the actors. The whole story is filled with contradictions and even paradox. The script in this movie is truly something special. To see two grown-up people trying to utter those asinine lines and making total fools out of themselves is why this may be worth watching. They were sitting there behind a conference table and discussing anal fisting and butt plugs like two politicians who are negotiating a peace treaty.Neither actor has much to go on with in terms of characterization. Their characters can only be objectively described using oxymorons. Dakota Johnson who plays Anastasia sticks with shy schoolgirl routine. Jamie Dornan who plays Christian sticks with being confused or annoyed. Sam Taylor-Johnson who plays the director apparently has no clue about what to do with this mess either. She was basically handed an explicit porno book ... uh, I mean 'erotic romance' and asked to make it into an R-rated movie. So she cleaned it up, made it pretty and shiny. The music tracks play almost non-stop in this movie. Rumor has it that E.L. James (the wicked witch who spawned this 50 shades franchise) was haunting the production set and screaming in a bullhorn, 'Don't touch my story. Undress Jamie Dornan now!!!' Maybe this is why the pacing is out of whack and editing is strange at some places.The 'erotic' scenes are by far the most boring part of the film. When Grey made a speech and said, 'I don't make love, I flog hard', for some reason I expected to see Jason Statham vs. Amy Smart type of action (Crank). Instead we get a few sleep-inducing commercials for hygiene products loosely inspired by 9 and 1/2 weeks. Anastasia gets blindfolded all the time which paralyzes her and makes her gasp for air. Not sure why. The so-called S&M sequence was a welcome comic relief though. Someone decided it would be funny to accompany this burlesque show montage by 'Crazy in Love' song played at 1/2 speed. They were right because it made Beyonce sound a bit.. stoned.So there you have it. Cheesy, sanitized, visual re-enactment of atrociously written porn fanfic, which in terms of filmmaking fails to measure up even to the crappiest sexploitation flicks from the 70s, somehow grosses half a billion. Isn't that true magic of cinema, or what? Well done, Universal. This thing was promoted and advertised in every corner of this planet, from Cambodia to Zimbabwe. And the person who thought it should be marketed as a romantic Valentine's Day movie certainly deserves some sort of award. Maybe a golden cactus butt plug or something, because that was pure genius. I normally don't rate movies with ones or tens, for even the worst movies (I've seen) have some sort of creative spark behind them. or at the very least serve as means for some silly people to express themselves. But in this case, I fail to see anything other than desire to exploit gullible masses and make profit out of nothing. A product of abysmal quality that was simply slapped together and put in pretty packaging to be marketed and sold -- not dissimilar to the malfunctioning 50 Shades lube (no joke).",1,3,7,8 March 2015
