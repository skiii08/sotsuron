The Blair Witch Project," The horror! The horror! I paid 7 bucks for that?!!??
","That is literally the scariest thing about this movie, the price that I had to pay to see it. And I thought the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan was bad... this was DEFINATLY worse... No, not the gore... Gore is fine, great in fact. But what were they THINKING with that camera work? The 'documentary feel? The Merry-Go-Round feel? Maybe I was just too sick to be scared by this movie.",1,0,2,30 July 1999
