It," IT is fantastic, roll on Chapter 2
","Watched this last night at my local cinema and I'm still buzzing about how good it was. This is as much a coming of age movie as it is a horror one. Visually stunning, great special effects & make up. I'm a seasoned horror fan, it takes a lot to scare me, but this had me jumping out of my seat more than once. Brilliant. The child actors that make up the Losers Club are all superb, to me they surpass Bill Skarsgard's excellent Pennywise, and are the real stars here. I don't understand these negative reviews on here, the fact that It currently scores 8/10 on IMDb says it all.",9,4,8,15 September 2017
Hereditary," Overhyped nonsense
","Supernatural horror movie about a disfunctional famiy living in a big house out in the woods. When death comes it reeks havoc. 
To say that this is a slow burn would be an understatement, very little happens horror wise in the first hour. If you're still awake eventually supernatural things start to happen. It could have been really good but it just goes off kilter by having a silly finale, which left me and other viewers scratching their heads. 
There are a few effective shocking moments and young Milly Shapiro does a great job of playing a creepy 13 year old. But the scariest thing for me was the horrible facial contortions of Toni Collette every time she gets angry. 
I wouldn't waste another 2 hours of my life watching this again.",4,6,13,25 June 2018
World War Z," Brad versus zombies
","Since Shaun of the Dead the zombie sub genre has been done to death, in particular ones featuring an apocalypse. Most are cheap crap but here we have Hollywood A lister, Curt Kobain lookalike Brad Pitt saving the human race from the undead. His quest takes him around the globe, which adds some interest, and there is plenty of action. In fact this is as much, if not more, of an action movie as it is a horror. Lots of CGI with mixed results. Pitt delivers a good performance, though his survival abilities must be super human. World War Z is a good enough movie for the masses, but it is very far fetched and too sentimental for my liking. Give me the zombies of Romero or Fulci any day!",6,0,1,4 January 2019
Us," Strange but pretty good
","An American family are on vacation at their holiday home when they are terrorised by a family of doppelgangers. Certainly not your typical home invasion movie! In fact it's not just them but, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers style, it has spread to their neighbours and well beyond. This is a rather strange story, an initial slow burn but it does thankfully make sense. Good characters, it is tense but also has quite a bit of humour. Soundtrack includes Luniz, Beach Boys and NWA. Not quite as good as Get Out but director/writer/producer Jordan Peele once again proves he is a talent worth watching.",7,1,3,1 April 2019
Creed," The Rocky saga continues
","The son of Apollo Creed, Adonis Johnson (very well played by Micheal B.Johnson) talks Rocky Balboa into training him as a professional boxer, eventually fighting for the World Light Heavyweight title in England (against real life boxer Tony Bellow).
Unlike John Rambo Rocky has had to hang up his gloves, in some ways this is a retread of the original movie. But that doesn't matter, it's a well made, engaging film. Sure, the fight scenes, although well filmed, are exaggerated, but that is in keeping with the previous movies. And at times it did feel a little too long.
Although this film is called Creed it is as much a Rocky movie, he's a fighter in more ways than one, I found that aspect quite touching. Sly Stallone, incredible actor, full respect to you.
Seconds out for the sequel..",7,0,0,9 February 2020
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Dark & bloody musical
","I watched Sweeney Todd 10 years ago on the big screen & was blown away by it, now I'm reviewing it having just watched it again on DVD at home. This film is many things - Gothic horror/slasher/musical/melodrama/comedy. It certainly starts off at a fairly leisurely pace in the musical/drama/comedy vein for it's first part, but once Todd begins his bloody work the story becomes very dark indeed, with many bloody & ruthless murders. Gore fans may become impatient for the wait, but on the other hand musical lovers may find the graphic violence too much. 
Great performances all round & fantastic dark, Victorian London sets. This is Depp, Burton & Bonham Carter at their best. My only quibble is that some of the scenes are a little too long, perhaps a slightly shortened running time would have helped. Superb.",8,2,3,16 September 2018
Suicide Squad," Good looking but not great
","The fact that a friend of mine lent me this on DVD and it's taken 12 months for me to finally pop the disc into my player reflects my lack of interest in superhero movies. Or perhaps superbaddies in this case?? I didn't even bother to read the case or the opening credits & was surprised that I didn't recognise Will Smith until the closing ones!
Starts off very well and is a very good looking film in terms of action but I just found that the second half slowed down & I started to slightly lose interest. BUT there is one very good reason to see this - Margot Robbie! Very sexy.",6,0,0,13 May 2018
Bridget Jones's Diary," Horror fan watched this chick flick and enjoyed it
","I can remember when this came out and a girl that I was dating at the time suggested I watch it. Me?? A die-hard horror geek!! Nah!! Fast forward 18 years and last night me and my girlfriend sat down together and watched it. And it was really good. Granted, I wouldn't have chosen to watch this by myself, but if you're looking for a charming, date movie then look no further.
Predictable and basic but it does have a nice plot none the less, and many times we were laughing out loud. Very well acted and produced. I would, however, like to point out that very few Brits speak posh like they do here, and that snow is quite rare in England at Xmas (unless you're on top of a mountain!)
Looking forward to seeing the sequel",7,1,1,10 August 2019
Predator," One of the best films from the 80's
","A crack team of special forces led by Arnold Schwarzenegger are dropped off in the Central American jungle on a rescue mission but end up being hunted by an incredible and deadly alien with the ability to become near invisible.
I can remember being blown away by this movie when it was released. Arnie is just superb, he looks and acts the part brilliantly, though he is given a run for his his money in the one-liners by Jesse 'I ain't got time to bleed!' Ventura. Carl Weathers, from the Rocky movies, is also great. Predator perfectly blends action with science fiction and horror, and despite what some reviews claim there is plenty of suspense too.Excellent special effects. In the UK this was released uncut on VHS but the early DVD releases are cut. Thankfully later ones are complete.
I do prefer the original Terminator but Predator is classic Arnie and classic action, essential viewing.",9,1,3,8 June 2019
American Pie," Classic sex comedy
","Many films benefit from repeated viewings but I think the opposite can be true of comedies, as second time around you know what's going to happen therefore it loses it's effect. First time I watched American Pie it had me in stitches, second time it amused me. So my 7/10 is based on that. It is a great & funny film about a much of guys desperate to lose their virginity but naturally with mixed & hilarious results. Couple of standout scenes here, Shannon E masturbating on web cam & one of the guys having sex with an American pie, worth seeing for those alone. Some strong language but the nudity is pretty low, they did ramp it up in the sequels, which are all worth checking out.",7,2,3,12 November 2017
Split," Another good movie from M.Night Shyamalan
","Three young girls are captured and held captive by a man who has 23 different personalities. It's many years since I watched Unbreakable and my girlfriend hasn't seen it at all but that didn't spoil any enjoyment of watching Split together on TV. James McAvoy steals the show here with his multiple personalities, he is obviously a very talented actor. The film has some great tension plus a few good jump scenes. The Beast is pretty awesome. The only thing I didn't like was the many conversations between McAvoy's personalities and his doctor did drag a little. I look forward to the next movie in the series, Glass.",7,0,0,28 January 2019
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Excellent
","Wolverine is sent from a very dark, near future back to 1973 in order to prevent a deadly war on mutants, thereby saving their race. Just a short review, this is one of the best X-Men movies, possibly the best. Non-stop action, superb special effects, great cast. Kicking myself for not watching the post credits scene - don't make the same mistake!",8,1,2,19 August 2017
Get Out," Impressive
","Watched this for the first time and I have to say that for a debut director Jordan Peele has done an excellent job, ignore these ridiculous 1/10 scores. Get Out is an addictive slow burn and it was great fun trying to figure out what was going to happen to our hero, very well played by Daniel Kaluuya. The film packs in some good, genuine scares but also has a fair share of humour. Good combination. Story wise it reminded me somewhat of The Stepford Wives but it is also quite original. Great stuff, I'm looking forward to seeing Peele's latest offering, Us.",8,3,7,24 March 2019
A Quiet Place," The terrifying sound of silence
","A family are forced to live in silence on their farm to avoid being killed by hideous blind creatures that hunt using sound. Pretty simple plot. There is no explanation as to what these presumably alien creatures are or where they came from, but that didn't bother me.
For most of its length A Quiet Place is pretty much a silent movie, our cast have to communicate using sign language. For the viewer it means subtitles. It did feel a little strange at first, the silence was initially deafening, but I got used to it. The film does have a dark, moody score and effects sounds, so it is far from completely silent. Still, there will undoubtedly be viewers who will be find having to read subtitles a chore - their loss! The movie is very well filmed, great camera work and sets (I loved a chase scene in a cornfield, you can't beat a bit of corn horror!). There is plenty of tension throughout and some good jump scenes. Acting is excellent. The movie also touches on family, coping with loss and what a parent is prepared to do for their children. A very impressive movie, one of the best horrors of the 2010's.",8,2,4,9 December 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," My favourite animated movie
","I can remember watching this at the cinema way back & being thrown into a magical place. Have now just revisited but with my son and in the comfort of my own home. An animated, musical love story that beautifully combines Halloween & Christmas. Based on characters written by & also produced by Tim Burton but NOT directed by him, I do feel that adding his name as a pre-fix is slightly misleading, but just a minor quibble. The fact that I have a The Nightmare Before Christmas 2017 calender hanging on my wall is testament to the film's enduring popularity.",8,0,0,24 December 2017
Jurassic World," Jurasic for a new generation
","The lives of everybody at Jurasic World are in grave peril when a genetically modified dinosaur - monster - escapes and embarks on a rampage of death and destruction. Very impressive special effects and plenty of action make this great viewing, though it may prove a little too scary for younger children. I am older enough to remember the original Jurasic Park but good to see the series given new blood for a new generation.",7,0,0,27 December 2017
The Fly," Brilliant remake
","In the 21st Century when us horror fans hear the word 'remake' it usually comes with a sigh, but there was a time when remakes were actually as good, if not better, than the original. The Fly is a perfect example, quite possibly one of the best remakes ever. Bit of a slow star (if you're lacking patience) but well worth sticking with. Superb direction by Cronenberg, two great leads in Goldblum & Davis plus some terrific transformation effects make this an 80's classic.",8,2,2,4 February 2018
Don't Breathe," Good, violent but flawed home invasion/suspense movie
","Three young, tech savvy burglars break into the home of a blind veteran, who has a stash of cash. They think he should be an easy target but he is more than capable of defending himself - and he harbours a very dark secret!
Effective home invasion/horror movie. It's well acted, has great cinematography, suspenseful and is very violent. But if is far from perfect. For a start, who are we meant to root for? Who is the victim here? Thieves versus crazy psycho. This dilemma bothered me throughout, and I can't say that I was pleased with the ending (not giving it away!). As mentioned our robbery victim is blind yet he is able to carry out tasks that just simply would not possible by himself. And another thing that really annoyed me was one of the robbers, a slightly built young man, endures multiple beatings and injuries yet he appears to possess amazing recovery powers!
Flaws aside this is a good, solid movie, it has just the right running time and plenty of action. This is strong stuff which may prove too much for more sensitive viewers.",7,0,1,3 December 2019
Psycho," Hitchcock's greatest work
","Since joining IMDB this is the first film that I have awarded a score of 10/10. Masterpiece that just improves with each viewing, however the two killing scenes lose their jump factor when you know they are about to happen. First time I watched this though I jumped out of my skin. Brilliantly directed and acted, great sets, one of the scariest/most effective musical scores in cinematic history and simply way ahead for it's time Grandfather of the slasher movie? Maybe, but, with a few odd exceptions (eg Carpenter's 'Halloween'), this is so so much better.",10,0,0,17 December 2017
Army of Darkness," More Bruce Campbell than Evil Dead
","Evil Dead is one of my top 10 horror movies of all time and Bruce Campbell as Ash in that was brilliant. Period. Evil Dead 2 did catch me off guard a little with its humour but it was an excellent sequel. I saw Army of Darkness upon its cinematic release back in 1992 and I recall thinking back then that in my opinion it just wasn't an Evil Dead movie, rather a fantasy that stars Ash and uses elements from the original story.
Don't get me wrong, Army is a well made movie. Wonderful sets (though that castle obviously is not English!), lots of action, great effects (more than a nod to Ray Harryhausen) and no end of humour (Monty Python's Holy Grail sprang to mind). This is a horror/fantasy comedy. And that is my problem. Too much of it in my opinion, this movie is all about Bruce Campbell and how much he can squeeze out of Ash. Fans of the character will delight in this but for me he quickly became more tedious than funny. I feel somewhat bad about awarding this 6/10 when I am such a fan of the original but had Ash been somewhat less in your face then I would have scored it higher.
Just finished watching the Director's Cut. I liked the additional material plus the ending (even though it has been ripped from a very well known sci-fi movie!).
It transpires that there are several releases of this cut which vary tremendously in picture quality. My DVD is awful, looks like a poor VHS transfer, but thankfully a high quality print was recently screened here in the UK.",6,0,1,21 December 2019
It Chapter Two," Waited 2 years only to be slightly let down
","It (2017) was simply superb, and consequently I was really looking forward to Chapter Two, avoiding all early reviews beforehand. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. It starts off with a brutal homophobic attack and I found myself wondering how on earth this was rated 15 as opposed to an 18. Chapter Two is simply too long, I found my eyes closing a few times near the end (admitably it had been a long day), Pennywise is not as scary this time and I found the final battle to be disappointing. The adult cast works well but it's the younger selves that steal the show. I'll certainly watch this again when released on DVD, perhaps a second viewing may earn a more generous rating. But I won't be paying the price of cinema admission again.",7,0,0,12 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Kong: not very good CGI Island
","A team of military and scientists land on the uncharted Skull Island and run into giant ape King Kong, as well as a host of other huge, mainly unfriendly creatures.
Pretty dumb popcorn entry into the Kong series, this is an insult to the original. However 21st Century kids will more likely enjoy it for the non stop CGI mash up, as for me give me physical effects any day. Set in 1973 there is an attempt at making it cool by including a pretty impressive soundtrack. Mr cool himself, Samuel L Jackson, doesn't seem quite at home in this one, certainly not one of the better movies on his CV that's for sure. Going back to the effects personally I didn't find the CGI very impressive and the onslaught wore thin rather quickly.
There is a post credits sequence that suggests a sequel, I for one won't be holding my breath!",5,0,0,13 June 2020
Carrie," A superb King adaptation
","Within the first three minutes of Carrie we are in a girls' locker room with full frontal nudity and poor Carrie, brilliantly played by Sissy Spacek, having her first period in the shower. That is quite a powerful way to start. For most of its running time Carrie does play as a teenage, school drama - Carrie is relentlessly bullied by both her school peers and by her religiously fanatical mother. It is a very sad tale. Carrie possesses powerful telekinetic powers and in the infamous Prom scene, where she is cruelly humiliated in front of the school, she unleashes these to devastating effect. Awesome! But her revenge doesn't end there!
I remember watching Carrie for the first time in the 1980' on TV, I nearly crapped my pants!! Having just watched it again it no longer has that effect, I assume that's because I'm older and know what to expect. Carrie is a brilliant film, one of the standout horror movies of the second half of the 1970's. Naturally it does look dated. The disco music is still pretty groovy, but the split screens look a tad naff now. It's quite behind with the times, John Travolta slapping his girlfriend around her face is seriously NOT cool! I liked the cinematography and de Palma is a great director, but there was no need for him to rip the famous Psycho shower scene music.
Essential viewing.",9,0,0,14 December 2019
Straight Outta Compton," Good biographic movie
","Music is a big part of my life, hip-hop being one of my favourite genres and I've been listening to NWA pretty much since they became famous so naturally I was keen to check this out, especially as I didn't know a great deal about the actual history of the group. Eazy E was arguably NWA's most colourful & controversial member and much of the film is focused on him. On the other hand Yella (who I saw live last year) and Ren sadly don't get much screen time. And apparently there are omissions in actual events too. 
I was in LA on my first trip to the USA during the Rodney King incident, I remember it well, and this is touched upon effectively several times throughout. The film is well made, has a good cast, obviously (if you like rap) has a great soundtrack & despite it's 2.5 hours running time it never gets boring. Great footage in the closing credits too, so keep watching!",7,0,1,24 August 2018
Mother!," An interesting slow burn that descends into nonsense
","What I liked about Mother! was its cast, Pairing up Jennifer Lawrence with Javier Bardem as a somewhat oddly matched married couple was interesting, but it seemed to work. Michelle Pfeiffer still looks stunning, and Ed Harris was good as a mysterious stranger. The large, Victorian house, situated remotely in the countryside, looked fantastic and creaked in all the right places. And for the first hour or so it played out as an interesting slow burn, with the odd twist and turn.
Sadly the movie takes a turn for arty, pretentious nonsense. I think I understood it but I certainly will not be putting my brain through that again! This may well appeal to fans of such movies as Hereditary or Us, but fans of Lawrence, who are used to seeing her in more mainstream movies, will be in for a shock and most probably a disappointment.",5,1,2,30 November 2019
Lucy," I liked it
","I had never heard of this movie until it was recently shown here on TV. Scarlett Johansson unwittingly gets transformed into some kind of super hero and sets out on a violent revenge against the gang of Chinese drug dealers who abused her. Simple but very entertaining. The film moves at a fast pace, plenty of violence & special effects, good cast & is set in China & France, so interesting locations. And Scarlett looks HOT as ever....",7,3,4,4 November 2017
Godzilla," Fantastic CGI
","I grew up watching the old Godzilla movies, loved them. Still do. But obviously this is a far cry from the Toho productions. I am not a great lover of CGI, so often it looks poor, but here they are simply amazing. They are indeed the star of this movie. Godzilla doesn't actually spend much time on screen, as others have complained, but sometimes less is more. Wish I'd seen it on the big screen instead of my 28' TV. Better than the 1998 version but I still prefer a man in a rubber suit!",7,1,2,31 August 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Fangtastic
","Me and a mate were talking abut movies in the pub a few weeks ago and he asked me if I had seen this one, to which I, a total horror film addict, had to to say no, I hadn't. Lo and behold, not long after, it was screened on TV. My mate said that he thought it was really funny and I have to totally agree.
Four vampires, raging from 8000 to a mere 183 years old, house share in Wellington, New Zealand and this comical mockumentary follows their hilarious night time exploits. We also get werewolves and zombies thrown into the melting pot, as well as a human character called Stu. I was very impressed by everything, the wit is spot on, the acting is sufficiently good, some pretty decent effects and gore, etc. So many horror comedies fail in my opinion but this one is a winner.",8,1,2,15 January 2020
Beetlejuice," Horror, fantasy, comedy & calypso!
","I saw this for the first time way back in the day, far too long ago to remember much about it. Then I picked up a cheap copy on VHS and a few nights ago I put it into my VCR. I kept falling asleep!! Was it because I was very tired, or is Beetlejuice boring? Well, I popped it back on last night and I can verify that it most certainly is not boring. Quite the opposite. It's crazy, dark, funny and original. Great sets and performances. Plus it has calypso. Genius! ' Daylight come and me wan' go home!'",8,0,1,11 February 2019
