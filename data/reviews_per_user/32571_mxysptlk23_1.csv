Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," best movie ever!
",I saw this movie at the black-carpet screening hosted by my space.com and it was the funniest thing I ever saw!!! I had to look away from the screen to stop laughing so I wouldn't laugh to death. The entire audience was laughing from beginning to end. I lost three friends because i didn't tell them I was going! Thank you my space! This was SO worth it. It was like watching an hour and a half long version of the show and not in that bad way like in some other movies. I highly recommend that anyone go and see this before the Prime minister of Kazahkstan tries to get this movie banned from our country. I think the best part of the movie is the overall view of the USA from an outside perspective. I think Sacha baron Cohen is a genius in using the character to make us laugh at ourselves. This is definitely a movie that will go on my shelf when it comes out.,10,4,25,11 October 2006
