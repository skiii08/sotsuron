The Avengers," Action-packed but hollow
","I heard somewhere this was the first great Marvel flick, or this was the one to watch first, or something like that. Overall, it was entertaining but nothing special. The characters and story are pretty cliched. Some powerful object (a tesseract) falls into the hands of a malicious superhero (Loki, well played by Tom Hiddleston) and a crew comes together to try to get it back from him before he can pass it to the evil aliens who want to destroy Earth. They try to liven things up by creating some character and conflicts and the like, but for the most part it is a snooze. Downey's Iron Man is ironic and witty, Thor turns out to be the estranged brother of Loki, yeah yeah. These kinds of flicks are plug and play, get some star actors and plug them in, and so long as they look the part, things work out. It is fun to watch them flying around midtown Manhattan and smashing things up. The effects are the real stars.It is interesting to note that like our ancestors from previous centuries, the modern world wants to have its myths and its heroes - I guess old habits tend to stick around. But these myths mean very little and serve mostly to keep people's eyes glued to a screen.",5,1,2,31 October 2019
Casablanca," We'll always have Casablanca
","Casablanca is one of the greatest movies ever made, and I have always loved it. I love the romanticism, the fascinating setting, the acting, Bogart's world weary, cynical Rick, the unforgettable dialogue, the mix of underworld and overworld, the complex, always moving story, the occasional humor, and the interesting mix of characters. There is a lot to love, but maybe most of all I love the connection that is made between people's personal lives and struggles and the greatest battle of all time, a battle between good and evil that was raging around them.",10,2,2,10 October 2019
The Irishman," More than just a mafia tale
","This has to be the last hurrah for the great De Niro and Pesci, doing another Scorsese flick together. Here they are not always believably playing young(ish) men some of the time. It is interesting to see Ray Romano playing a smooth lawyer. If this was just a gangster flick, it would not be a great one, but it is memorable because it is more than that. This is a tale about morality and loyalty. It presents the life story of a decent, loyal guy, a devoted family man and trustworthy buddy - who is also a crook and a cold-blooded killer, a Mafia operative and hit man, a guy who would shoot a friend in the face or the back if it was called for. The long ending and slow start recall the films of an earlier era, as does the prolonged presentation of the Jimmy Hoffa story.",8,2,2,6 May 2020
Pan's Labyrinth," Cool fx and weird fantasy world steal the show
","Awesome special effects are the best thing about this film from writer/director/ producer Guillermo del Toro. A little girl discovers a weird fantasy land that helps her cope with the pain and trouble all around her - an evil, macho, fascist stepfather, a seriously ill mother, and the Spanish Civil War raging in the woods outside of the estate/garrison that she recently moved into. It is an effective blend of fantasy and reality, but there is a problem. The fantasy world stuff is lively, creepy, and intense - but the ordinary world provides pretty standard violent melodrama, and is not as effective. A recent BBC critics poll placed this in the top 20 films since 2000.",7,1,1,7 January 2019
The Doors," As good a Doors movie as we will ever see
","This film has been hit with a lot of criticism over the years. I guess that with a group as controversial and beloved as the Doors, there are always going to be points of disagreement. And there were things that rubbed me the wrong way too, like casting pleasant Meg Ryan as Pamela Courson, who in some accounts was no sweetheart. And the Morrison death scene too, which most likely came from a heroin overdose - but there is no sign of that in the film. (I'm no Doors expert btw, but I have read a few things here and there.) But for my money, this is as powerful and exciting a dramatized version of their story as we are ever going to see. The cinematography and production are first rate, and Kilmer is very convincing as Morrison.",8,1,1,5 September 2018
Barry Lyndon," Gorgeous and sweeping, but has its flaws
","I can see that this is a hugely popular and acclaimed film, but I have to admit to being out of step with the other cinemaphiles on this one. It is beautiful to watch - the cinematography, design, the costumes, and even the hairstyles are magnificent. But there is a problem here. The main character is a prick. Barry is a roguish adventurer and a con artist - not an easy man to love. Btw I am usually not the guy who says, 'the hero needs to be more likeable' but in this case I found myself thinking it. In the mid 1700s a young, bold, arrogant Irishman finds himself hitting the road after a duel, joining the British army, and conniving his way around Europe, finally wheedling his way into a marriage with a wealthy, titled widow. Barry does eventually get what is coming to him, something Kubrick's narrator informs the audience of well in advance. O'Neal looks the part, but his feeble Irish accent is a drawback. As a sweeping 18th century drama the film certainly deserves respect.",6,0,0,16 April 2020
The Shining," An unforgettable viewing experience
","An unforgettable viewing experience that stays with everyone who watches it. Featuring Nicholson's over-the-top performance, Crothers' fine supporting role, the ultra dark soundtrack, King's creepy story, and the big old hotel. It all adds up to much more than just a superbly made horror flick.",10,3,5,25 January 2020
Being John Malkovich," Oh to be someone else (for 15 minutes)
","Director Jonze and writer Kaufman made only 2 films together, but they were 2 of the best films ever - innovative, funny, challenging, weird, and surprisingly engaging. This is one of them. Now they are both auteurs (as is Michel Gondry, who directed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) - but Kaufman is not a great director and Jonze is a mediocre writer. Come on guys, help each other out. I wish they would work together again - I am sure a lot of people do.This is kooky and surreal, with a strong scifi element, but what it is really about is people's neurotic, unrealized lusts and dreams. Kaufman touches on people's desires to be someone else, to love in a ways that are impossible, and to live forever.Keener and Malkovich are both brilliant, and so is Orson Bean in a supporting role. Sean Penn pops up in a cameo. I wonder if he was approached to do this - how interesting would that have been, with him in the title role?",10,0,0,20 December 2019
Spirited Away," Entertaining anime classic
","Very nice animation and an unusual, wacky tale. A girl and her parents stumble across an enchanted old theme park that turns out to be . . . a sauna/spa for ghosts and monsters! The parents are turned into pigs, and the girl must fight to survive, and hopefully to find romance and free her elders. There are lots of wacky characters and images, and it is a lot of fun. I was not as blown away as a lot of people were, but this is an entertaining flick.",8,0,1,7 November 2018
Man on the Moon," Carrey superbly embodies Kaufman's weirdness and complexity
","I was never Andy Kaufman's biggest fan, althou I laughed at Latka Gavras along with everyone else, but this is much more interesting. Jim Carrey superbly embodies Kaufman's weirdness, and helps make the eccentric funny man into a complex and occasionally heroic character. Good performances all around.",9,0,0,25 January 2020
Get Out," A fresh, disoncerting, and often funny look at race in America
","I totally disliked this at first. It starts off like an updated version of 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', with a young, stereotypical white woman from an upper class family trying to prove her liberal, anti-racist bona fides by bringing her black boyfriend home to meet her family. But then things start getting interesting, as Chris (the African-American hero) begins running into increasingly disturbing situations. There is the faux-hearty banter with the family, with its racial overtones. And then there is the matter of the strange behavior of the family's black employees. Get Out is fresh, disconcerting, and often funny. Racial tension between white and black Americans is clearly the subject, but things never get preachy. I was not crazy about the ending, which veers into horror/cult movie territory, but this is a unique and fascinating film.",8,3,8,11 July 2019
Pi," Thrilling, intense, and cerebral
","This is intense, cerebral, suspenseful, and visually thrilling. What more could you want from a low budget film? Shot in super grainy, high contrast black and white, Pi focuses on a brilliant but disturbed young man named Max Cohen. He lives in a little apartment in Chinatown, New York City that is packed with computer equipment, and spends his free time looking for a secret algorithm that underlies the changes in the stock market - or maybe even something more important, like life itself. He is befriended by another young man who is part of a mystical Jewish cult that thinks Max has something they want - nothing less than the name of God. Some sort of shadowy business people are also after him. But who knows what is really happening? You see, Max is not right in the head . . .Writer-director Aronofsky clearly has a thing for this type of story, since it is pretty similar to 'The Black Swan', another of his films. That is more technically accomplished, but I prefer this one.",10,0,1,13 December 2018
Empire Records," Have a few laughs and send it off to oblivion
","This 1990s teens/20s comedy is pretty awful for the most part, but it does have its pleasures. Among them are the opportunity to watch pre-superstardom Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger prancing gorgeously around, and some appearances by other young actors who went on to do more interesting stuff. The dumb script centers around a Tower Records-like store where the characters all work. One of them took the store's proceeds and lost it all gambling, and now everyone is trying frantically to keep the place from being sold to a competitor - or something along those lines. It deserves a viewing and a few good laughs before being sent off to oblivion.",4,0,3,25 February 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," A steady jet of fun
","Now this was a lot of fun and better than I expected. The quickly forgettable plot (borrowed from the Lord of the Rings) involves a group of second-rate intergalactic heroes who band together, one of them having found a ball that confers great, almost impossible to control power and energy. Some thuggish types are out to get it for themselves, so let the fun begin. The movies provides a steady jet of lively images and more than the usual amount of humor. However, can we declare a moratorium on the use of big stars doing voice over for cute but obnoxious little creatures and giving them harsh New York accents?",8,0,1,28 August 2019
World Trade Center," Standard Rescue Drama
","This starts out like it is going to be a fresh and exciting take on the World Trade Center attack, but then gets bogged down and becomes a standard rescue drama. Two cops find themselves stuck under the rubble of the collapsed WTC - will they be rescued in time? Their families are very worried. Cage and Pena provide solid performances, and the images of the wreckage are intense. Based on true story.",5,3,4,1 July 2019
The Waterboy," Annoying and stupid
",This dumb comedy is a strong candidate for worst flick of the 1990s. Sandler does an unbelievably annoying Andy Kaufman shtick all the way through.,1,0,2,11 May 2020
Parasite," A potently weird take on class differences
","This potently weird dark dramedy was the surprise hit of 2019, and even took the Academy Awards by storm - the first non-English language film to win the best picture wtf?? It starts out like a satirical take on class differences and tensions, and ends up going its own loony way, with a secret bomb shelter playing a key role in the plot.",9,2,6,18 February 2020
Paths of Glory," Paths of Corruption
","One of Kubrick's early features, this seems to have established him as a great young director. It is more than just an anti-war war story; unlike any other war flick I can think of it shows that soldiers faced peril not only from the enemy but from their officers as well, and portrays the whole business of war as corrupt. In this, an egomaniac general, dreaming of becoming a national hero, sends his troops on a hopeless attack. When they are pinned down and forced to turn back, he blames them and several soldiers are chosen to be executed for cowardice. Kirk Douglas is excellent as the one of the few good guys in the bunch, who fights to save the lives of his men. There is a touching coda at the end with a bunch of soldiers listening wistfully to the singing of a terrified German girl (the only woman in the film) who has been forced to perform for them. Great performances from Menjou and Macready, and some awesome tracking shots across battlefields.",9,0,0,14 February 2020
Despicable Me," The usual foolishness and cool animation - it is popular in China!
","I decided to watch this because I saw little Despicable Me minions all around China when I travelled there. Unfortunately I fell asleep a half hour in. The best thing about this is the kool Pixar-type animation. There are some funny images, like the ones featuring Gru bombing thru the streets of what looks like a hillier version of Brooklyn in his ridiculous jet-powered vehicle. The story is the usual violent cartoon foolishness. And I've said it before and will say it again - why in the world do they need big stars to do the voice overs in movies like this? Why not give some lesser known actors a chance? I'm sure they could do it just as well - althou Steve Carell does give another of his fine performances.",4,0,2,23 July 2019
Annihilation," Not what it could have been
","This film is not what it could have been or was trying to be, that much is clear. Fortunately some awe-inspiring effects and a wave of energy towards the end keeps it from being a real stinker, but the problems remain. What problems? You could call it ground-breaking to cast a bunch of actresses in the traditionally male roles of a team of scientists and explorers checking out an unexplainable phenomenon, but in this case you could also call it boring and unbelievable. There is zero chemistry between the romantic leads (Portman and Isaac) and Portman seems pretty detached throughout. She and her team are called on to inspect some sort of anomaly (the shimmer) that appears to rewrite the genes of animals and do other weird things. The movie is clearly influenced by J.G. Ballard's weird phenomena stories, SF horror flicks, and especially by Tarkovsky's 'Stalker.' At the end you will still be scratching your head over what took place, but it is not likely you will care very much.",6,1,3,20 May 2019
Her," Falling love with a smartphone
","I saw this in a theater and didn't like it because I was in a front row and the endless close-ups of Phoenix talking to his phone began to annoy. But on the small screen it works really well. The actors' performances are excellent and the script is very good as well. There are plenty of ironic laughs (the consommation scene is a real hoot) but underneath them is a sad theme - this is all about people's inability to connect with each other in the digital age, and how we can grow closer to our machines than to other humans. The main character, a recently divorced, sensitive fellow, begins to fall in love with the artificial intelligence (called an 'OS' in the movie) that runs his phone. Johansson brings a lot of life to the AI's voice. Come on, Spike Jonze, you are great director - direct some more movies!",10,0,0,16 March 2020
