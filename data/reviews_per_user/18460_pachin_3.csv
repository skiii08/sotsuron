Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All special effects, little character developement.
","Before I make a comment on Star Wars: Episode I, I'd like to state I loved the original Star Wars series, especially the first 2 in that series.  This prequel is good for the special effects and the action but there is very little character development.  It is a waste of some great actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman. 
One major problem with any prequel is that you know the history of many of the characters and what will happen.  There is less excitement.  As the technology has improved to make the special effects better and better, George Lucas has come to have less emphasis on what makes a truly great movie, character development.  We cannot love the characters in this movie as much as we loved the characters in the original Star Wars series because don't understand them as well.  That being said, I will always look forward to a Star Wars movie because the anticipation of a potential great movie experience is always there.",6,0,1,11 April 2003
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 2 is great!
","One of the major reasons Spider-Man has been so beloved with his fans is that he is a regular guy first, a superhero second. He's a regular person with problems like any other human being, except for the fact that he has super powers.When I used to read comic books when I was a child I could not identify with superheroes like Superman, who even with his supposed mild mannered secret identity of Clark Kent really didn't have any major problems and seemed to come out on top all the time. Enter Spider-Man and his true identity of Peter Parker. Peter was an ordinary guy and had problems we all could identify with. He's first Peter Parker and Spider-Man second. We could look at the depth of the character.In Spider-Man 2 we understand what makes Peter tick. The development of the characters is first and foremost and the action sequences are secondary to the story, fabulous as they may be. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco do an excellent job and Alfred Molina is terrific as Dr. Octopus.",10,0,0,30 June 2004
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's greatest movie and one of the greatest comedies, no, one of the great movies of all time.
","Two clues to tell if a movie is great is how often it is copied and how it has become a part of American slang. Groundhog Day has had both happen to it. Warning: POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Bill Murray played Phil Connors, a egocentric and grumpy weatherman in Pennsylvania who goes to Punxsutawny, Pa every year to see if the groundhog sees his shadow for the local television station with his producer, played by the wonderful Andie MacDowell, and his cameraman, played by a low keyed Chris Elliot.Everything goes as Phil expects on the first day, except he is caught in a blizzard and has to stay the night. The next morning he awakes and it's Groundhog Day again! This pattern happens over and over again until he realizes he cannot escape Groundhog Day. In time Phil realizes the advantages of knowing what's going to happen before it happens and Murray takes full comic advantage of it. However if this film was just that, it would be just a normal run of the mill comedy. Murray's character Phil learns and grows and becomes a better person during the course of the film and learns to love the town in which he felt he was trapped in. The chemistry with MacDowell's character of Rita is wonderful. It's a great film and to my mind the best comedy, no perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.",10,154,207,17 November 2003
