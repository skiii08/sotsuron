Skyfall," The worst Bond ever!
","'Skyfall' is properly the worst bond-movie I've seen and I think I've seen them all! You can separate the movie into two halves: the first half spreads a bit of the good old Bond-flair but still is pretty boring; the second half gets really bad! It seems like they already had an end to the story but noticed that the whole movie is to short and added a second half from a different script. While watching the second half I felt like I was watching an average action-flick, something like 'Die Hard 4 1/2', but not an Bond-movie anymore. And please: no more hacker guys who're able to open every door around them by hitting some keys on their computer keyboard! That's such a bulls***!",3,6,15,5 March 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What a boring and pointless flick
","Oh dear! Tarantino, you're prime ist definatley over. One star is for the acting, the other for the Bruce Lee-scene. Everything else are just randomly aligned scenes with no build up and storyline. Almost during the whole movie you find youself just waiting for the one scene you know is coming right after Shannon Tate appears - and you're waiting endlessy long just to see a It seems like Tarantino knew is film is boring but needed something to keep the viewer at it.",2,2,6,6 January 2020
Annihilation," Quite interesting to watch...
",...but one thing bugged me the whole movie: Why the way through the woods? Why didn't anyone try to aproach the Lighthouse by boat?,5,1,3,14 June 2019
