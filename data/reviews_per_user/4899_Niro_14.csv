50 First Dates," 'Groundhog Day' Meets 'Memento' -- NOT
","Expected to see 'Groundhog Day Meets Memento' as a subject of one of the moronic viewers here (although 'See It 50 Times!!!' never seemed like a possible refrain so thought I'd try to jump that gun.Taking the former's premise, penultimate bachelor/hound Sandler has to woo brain-damaged Drew every day in a (totally) different way...Why he does this (in that totally different way) is never clear.  Why she doesn't respond exactly the same way every day isn't clear either.Which is okay.My wife and I saw this the day it was released, and we were vacationing in Hawai'i, on Oahu, where some of this is filmed (and where all of it is set).We'd just visited the Sea Life touristy park where Sandler's character is purportedly one of the marine biologists.Side note: there are no walruses on any island of Hawai'i, so the entire opening comedy blitz is lame.  Sea lions yes.  Walruses no.As for the film, it really couldn't be more manipulative.  Some of the comedy yanks a laugh, many of the scenes with Barrymore draw tears.Schneider's fairly good as a native Hawai'ian but his character is as stereotypical as you'll find (see the Honolulu Star-Bulletin for 2/13/04).Oh yeah -- Sean Astin isn't a Hobbit here.  As Barrymore's brother he's a lisping steroid-enhanced freak.Literally not worth writing the rest of this review.Truly a dog among barf jokes.Rent 'The Wedding Singer' if you'd like to see this pair go toe to slipper.",3,3,6,15 February 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me Not
","You'll pardon me for not concurring that this is Spielberg's best film in years (and Lord knows that he keeps sucking my wife and I into those $8.50 box-office tickets anyway).'Minority Report' has been called the antithesis of this so-called 'breezy' film (because the parents in CMIYC 'care' -- or at least one of them does) but that's giving Spielberg way too much credit.A word of advice: don't watch 'The Grifters'  (which I did the night before viewing this mess), possibly the best con film this side of 'The Sting.'
Hell, don't even see the underrated 'Harry in Your Pocket' or even 'The Flim-Flam Man' before checking out this ultimate con of your $$$.Funnily enough, the biggest con here is Steve grabbing the money he lost when you didn't see 'A.I.' or 'Minority Report.'And what a mess it is: Tom Hanks manages the worst Massachusetts accent since the lamentable Costner's in 'Thirteen Days' (and I'm one of the film snobs who actually LIKES Hanks -- his turn in this year's 'Road to Perdition' is worthy of a nomination: not a win, mind you, but a nod).Hanks' accent wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't in approximately every other scene.The Saul Bass-inspired opening creds (think 'Pink Panther' flix) and cool initial John Williams score suggests a fun retro film, but this just isn't. It's 'Ocean's Eleven' sans the cool.Dispensible characters come and go with no follow-up whatsoever (Jennifer Garner in a truly 'what's she doing here?' cameo, Marty Sheen and his daughter-character -- who are actually important to the story, but disappear when their usefulness subsides: basically 10 minutes after their arrival).Though 'based on actual events,' several interludes smell like Spielberg inventions, not the least of which are Leo's 'just missing' being caught episodes, which play out here like old Marx Bros. sketches -- without Groucho and Harpo and Ms. Dumont.By the way, Leo's pretty good here (how can this 28-year-old still look 16?).But while watching the film I couldn't help but wonder what the book was like -- and comparing Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s exploits as portrayed here to those of the fellow from Michigan who was arrested a few years back. The latter not only impersonated doctors, airline pilots and more but actually performed operations, flew planes, etc. From memory, the guy was the greatest impostor in history.Oh wait, there *was* that old Tony Curtis film, 'The Great Impostor' -- maybe I'll have to check that out again as well.Christopher Walken's most endearing role ever (?) in a nice turn as Leo's dad can't overcome the average DP work, Hanks' worst performance in a few years, a really shoddy script and, well, STEVE.Catch it not. But *do* rent 'The Grifters.' Or 'Ocean's Eleven'... even the original. No wait -- stick with the *other* Steven's version ;)4/10 Out",4,1,10,31 December 2002
The Doors," Excellent Film, Despite Others' Comments
","No, Oliver Stone didn't 'want to deny you the real story' behind Morrison [as another reviewer claimed]; I too have read all of the worthwhile books re: Jim Morrison, and this is exceptionally faithful.And Kilmer is simply incredible.  Central cast [Meg Ryan, Frank Whaley, Kyle MacLaclan, Kevin Dillon as Jim's wife and the rest of the Doors] is perfect, as are the odd compilation of supporting players: Mimi Rogers, Kathleen Quinlan, the always-whacked-out Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol, and bit parts by Michael Madsen, Jennifer Rubin, Will Jordan, Paul Williams, etc.The only flaw I can see [from Stone] is the ending [featuring real-life Doors drummer John Densmore], which makes it seem as if Morrison is still alive...As if. 3.5 of 4 Niro~Stars",9,2,2,16 February 1999
Armageddon," Typical Bruckheimer Testosterone-Filled Nonsense
","Literally a two-note movie: legitimately dazzling SPFX combined with yet another Jerry Bruckheimer-produced testosterone-laden tale of the search for redemption (ie. 'Top Gun,' 'Days of Thunder' etc. etc. ad nauseum).Utterly flawed in too many ways to mention.If you really need to view the clearly under-exposed Bruce Willis (that's a joke ~ please don't write me about it) in another flick, continue reading:To see that he can actually 'act' PLEASE rent 'In Country' (I won't even mention 'Pulp Fiction' ~ whoops! Too late.)  But find 'In Country' ~ this guy's more talented than anyone gives him credit for.Which is not proven here.For action and FX, skip the obvious 'Die Hard' flix (except for the 1st one with Rickman) and rent the amazing 'The Fifth Element'...But Bruce holds no candle here for wasted perfs: *everyone* else in 'Armageddon's' talented cast is wasted: From Billy Bob Thornton as the head of NASA's team, to Ben Affleck as Bruce's daughter's (gorgeous Liv Tyler) heart~throb, to the getting-better-with-each-supporting-appearance Will Patton, to the always remarkably-odd Steve Buscemi, and to Tyler herself (whose contract must have had a clause that made Bruckheimer use one of her ancient Aerosmith dad Steven Tyler's still-'70s-sounding tunes every five minutes).Hey! As a bonus, you get to see the seriously-aging rock band perform one of the 700 Aerosmith tunes from the movie at the end of the tape.Total nonsense.  An awful flick (I can't call it a film).No Niro~Stars.  Zero.  Zed.",1,0,2,14 November 1998
American Beauty," A Dysfunctional Masterwork
","Simply put, this is probably the best American film I've seen since Quentarantino's quintessential 'Pulp Fiction.'From the opening shot, in which we see a scantily~clad teen matter~of~factly discussing the possibility of killing her father to make her life easier, to the next scene, where we find said 42~year~old daddy masturbating in the shower and proclaiming that this will be the highlight of his day, to the absolutely brutal but pretty much predetermined closing sequence, 'American Beauty' beats you into submission with a clarity which I don't recall seeing in years.For my money, Kevin Spacey's performance is the best by an American actor since Denzel's perfect 'Malcolm X.'And, were it not for Hilary Swank's amazing turn as Brandon Teena in 'Boys Don't Cry,' Bening would have deserved the Oscar as Spacey's bitchy self~determined, self~centered, image is everything, real~estate~queen~wannabe wife.Within a few scenes, we realize that Spacey is about to leap off the edge.What with eminently~priveleged Wednesday Addams lookalike daughter [Thora Birch] contemplating his murder with new boyfriend/pot~dealer 'Ricky' [eerily portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix's better~looking apparently~twin brother, Wes Bentley] because daddy has been staring at her new sexpot~girlfriend Mena Suvari a bit more longingly than a grown man should, and with mommy Annette spending more time gleaming 'Real Estate King' Peter Gallagher's cube than polishing Kevin's bishop, this quickly becomes 'ok, so who's gonna kill him first?'NOTE:  I haven't even given anything away that you don't see in the 1st 20 minutes.And so it goes, with Spacey bowling you over again and again with cool, if twisted, well... twists.I saw this at the theater five days ago, and I'm still talking about it with anyone who'll listen.And that's the first time I've done that in years.The only Oscar it won which should have gone to another film was Conrad Hall's for cinematography.  The cin is good but, apart from the excellent plastic bag sequence, only adequate.  Leigh's 'Topsy~Turvy' should've easily snared the award.Before I saw 'American Beauty,' I thought that 'The Ice Storm' was a superior film.  Still do.  But not superior to this.Because Spacey's 'Lester' makes this a true masterwork.**** of **** Niro~Stars",9,0,0,31 March 2000
Dark City," Leonard Norwitz Said It Best
","There's little I can add to his superior review, apart from saying that he seems to be the only other one to have drawn the connection from the look of the late Anton Furst's set design for Burton's first 'Batman' film and this miraculous production.The dark, noirish look is simply astounding ~ and I held my breath at each of the city's midnight transformations.  This is more than what's available to do technically ~ it's a vision.The look and feel is one part Serling, one part Huston, one part Gilliam, one part Hitch, one part Kubrick, one part Lynch, one part Cronenberg and a few Barkers thrown in for good measure.Roundly excellent performances [even from the lovely but generally non-descript Connelly] and an utterly original story.I'll watch this again and again ~ and likely shake my head in wonder as many times as I did upon my first viewing.4 Niro~stars of 4.",10,1,2,15 March 1999
54," Everything Mike Myers Touches Turns To Gold
","Virtual unknown Mark Christopher's '54' came out at essentially the same time as Stillman's 'The Last Days of Disco,' and most of us who are still Stillman hopefuls were expecting a TKO.Sadly though, even with Kate Beckinsale in the cast, 'Days' finishes a poor second.Mike Myers, in his first truly dramatic role, is absolutely superb as the ubiquitous and egocentric Steve Rubell ~ the man who literally invented trendy~but~exclusive NYC hot~spots with his Studio 54.But Myers is merely the thread which holds several subplots together. 
Most of these involve lowlife Jersey kid, 'Shane' [Ryan Phillippe], who happens upon the club nearly by accident.  Shane, via several personally~compromising situations, is fairly~quickly elevated to 'waiter' status which, at 54, meant overnight stardom.Neve Campbell, as an ex~Jersey girl who has made it semi~big on a soap opera, excels as the object of Shane's desires.Salma Hayek, in what is likely her best performance thus far, is terrific as the disco star wannabe.I continue to be amazed with Mike Myers ~ even when he's not doing his comedy schtick, he makes it work.  This is a true oddity for ex~SNL personnel: Bill Murray, John Belushi & Dan Aykroyd's attempts at drama have been at best adequate [depite Aykroyd's nomination for the awful 'Driving Miss Daisy'] and at worst, deplorable [all of Aykroyd's other work].The guy is gold.  Buy his IPO when it shows up on Wall Street.",10,2,4,25 February 2000
Man on the Moon," If You 'Got' Kaufman You'll 'Get' This
","Forman's second straight bio~pic works better than his last ('The People vs. Larry Flynt,' which was good but more flawed).I followed Andy Kaufman's career from its meager beginnings (actually saw that Fridays episode live, as well as all of his SNL perormances, most of that woman~wrestling phase, the Lawler match & Letterman interview, etc.) thru the shock of stumbling across his surprise obit.Like many others, I thought that it too was yet another in a series of the serio~comic's brilliant geneology of gags.Of course we were wrong.But I always felt that I 'got' his brand of humour, his 'winking at us' eye. Then again, I'm among the few I know who also 'get' Dennis Miller. Or moviejuice.com's genius, Mark Ramsey.And while I more often than not find box-office heavyweight Jim Carrey annoying (has everyone forgotten his early career? Once Bitten?) he really delivers here. As he did in '98's The Truman Show.Within the first five minutes of his excellent opening 'monologue from the grave,' I completely forgot I was watching Carrey and began recalling favorite Kaufman moments, all of which are covered here.Most bio~pics feature good and occasionally great impersonations. This is neither. I mean Carrey IS Kaufman.He's got the look (on and off-camera), the voice(s), the very essence of Andy... the non-comedian.Paul Giamatti finally gets a meatier role as Kaufman's partner/co-writer/co-experiencer Bob Zmuda and is fine. Courtney Love ~ a new Forman staple? ~ is good as the love interest. DeVito's a stabilizing factor as Andy's agent.And Forman pulls it all together with style, perception and above all, dignity.Couple of questions:Why bring the 'Taxi' cast back together for this? So that we can see them 30 years later? Jeez, these guys & gals look AWFUL. Co-star DeVito's wife Rhea even avoided this project.And if Milos Forman could pull the 'Taxi' folks in, why couldn't he talk Michael Richards ('Fridays,' 'Seinfeld' and his self-named TV show which appears to be headed for 6-week termination) into doing this? Norm MacDonald's terrific, but he's no Michael Richards.Kinda cool to see 'Newhart' regular Peter Bonerz (Jerry, 'The dentist who was less funny than Bill Daly') as Ed. (period) Weinberger.Pleasant inside joke.HEY MILOS: DO SAM KINISON NEXT! NOW *THERE'S* A STORY.9/10 Niro~Stars",9,0,0,25 November 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes Wide Closed
","This is a vile waste of celluloid, and if you think it's an 'art house film,' then you've never been to an art house.I concur with Michael Kenmore's review here: this is no way to remember Kubrick.Once again, Cruise fails to create the effect that he can act, even in a truly awful film.  Kidman, in a surprisingly small role, is the best thing here except for the cinematographer.Even Cruise's hair is bad.  And that's saying something.The preposterous [and lengthy] script is worse, however, with absurdist dialogue in abundance.  It literally mocks itself in its self-importance, and ~ in case you don't get it ~ telegraphs the film's every move [example: the password for the 'private party' is 'Infidelio' ~ GET IT???].If there's even the slightest moment of suspense here for any of you, please rent virtually any Hitchcock film.And the 'it's ok, I'm a doctor' wasn't working the first time, nor the fourth.The excellence of the camerawork is utterly overwhelmed by the most irritating film score in years: within the first hour I was trying to reach through the screen to crush the fingers of Jocelyn Pook and her grating 'two notes on a piano in every octave imaginable' music.The so-called 'extremely graphic' content?  Mild, at the very best.Sure Kidman is topless a few times, and there are a few glimpses of her [rather extraordinary] derriere.  But we've seen these goods before.  Nary a bum from Cruise for the ladies.  And the so-called orgy scene, complete with the famed digital shadowy cloaked men to hide the allegedly explicit parts, is a limp disaster.And you thought that Verhoeven's lamentable 'Showgirls' was the most unerotic movie ever made which tried to shock you with its nudity?  Or was that 'Romance'...The only scene which I'll remember is the one in which Kidman confesses her almost~infidelity to Cruise, which sets this on its course.Here's how bad this film is: all three interviews on the DVD version are tributes to Kubrick, not to this film.  Steven Spielberg even weighs in with a 'best actors' list ~ Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, etc.  Ahhh... nary an actor among them.  Movie stars, yes.Just like Tom Cruise.See 'Paths of Glory' for Kubrick's brilliance.  Or '2001.'  Or 'A Clockwork Orange.'  Or 'Full Metal Jacket.'  Or even 'The Shining.'Avoid this.Um, and 'Barry Lyndon.'And most of all, 'Spartacus.'",2,1,2,18 March 2000
Titanic," An Injustice To The Survivors
","Any human being who considers 'Titanic' to be among the top 250 films of all time should be strapped to a chair in a small room and be forced to watch any Tom Cruise vehicle several hundred times.  In pan 'scan format.Like so many awful Best Picture winners which came before it, 'Titanic' does a horrible injustice to its so-called intended 'heroes'... in this case, by stereotyping them, making them dispensible.The most recent B.P. winner to have borrowed this technique is Costner's aberration, 'Dances With Wolves,' which pretended to be about the plight of the Native Americans, whose country we literally stole from them, and turning it into a fable about how one __white__ man rises above his equals to 'appreciate' the former.  See 'Black Robe,' 'Little Big Man' or 'Soldier Blue' instead.The politically~correct 'Driving Miss Daisy' suffers the same fate: it should be about Freeman's character, which is infinitely more interesting than Tandy's.'Forrest Gump' is nearly as insulting, by changing the book in such away as to take the worst of Gump's traits and failings and foisting them on the Robin Wright Penn's 'Jenny' character, leaving sweet Forrest a saint and Jenny a slut.  'Pulp Fiction,' also released in 1994 has already had a greater effect on filmmaking than 'Gump' ever will.And __that's__ not even Tarantino's best film!Despicable.While we're at it, let's add to this list of garbage which has recently won Best Picture: Mel Gibson's lamentable 'Braveheart,' which, while sporting excellent large~scale battle scenes, is nearly entirely fictional.More proof that Hollywood's elite still like guys who've paid their dues in front of the camera.'Gandhi'???  Don't even get me started on that Best Costume Design Oscar, let alone its B.P.The trend may have begun in 1939, with the single most overrated flick of all time ['Gone With The Wind' of course] beating out at least seven better films made in the same year.~Niro",1,12,23,30 January 2000
Titanic," Rivals 'Gone With The Wind' as most overratred film of all time
",Cameron's alleged masterpiece has two things going for it: amazing digital effects and the fact that the vessel broke in half.Dozens of excellent real-life stories are abandoned for an an insipid love story.See the excellent 'A Night To Remember' instead.0 of 4 Niro~Stars,1,2,6,24 March 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter and the Return of the Happy Meal
","The most eagerly-awaited book-to-film translation arrives with a thunderous roar but eventually takes a few bad turns and winds up just another bombastic marketing escapade. Buy a Sorceror's Happy Meal and get your very own magic wand free. The film cost $125 million to make and a third more ($40M) to market.At the start, it seems as though Chris Columbus has melded 'Mary Poppins' with 'Willy Wonka' fairly well, with Harry's nagging foster parents, a loutish blowhard bully of a foster-brother, a cool giant of a man (Robbie Coltrane, who pretty much steals this show), a cool scene in Victorian England's 'Diagon Alley' (get it?) where Harry buys his sorcery supplies, fun cameos (by John Hurt, John Cleese and others), brooding would-be villain Alan Rickman, priggish professor Maggie Smith, wisened Headmaster Richard Harris, etc.The sets are superb, the special effects for the most part, excellent, although the CGI-splattered Quidditch game is over-the-top ~ reminding one of Lucas' pod-race in 'The Phantom Menace' and paling in comparison ~ and some of the stop-action stuff simply looks dumb.Daniel Radcliffe is just about perfect as Potter, although his character frequently is left with nothing to do but react to others -- a fatal flaw for a film's hero. The part of his amusing worst-luck wizard pal 'Ron' is very well-acted by newcomer Rupert Grint. But Emma Watson's 'Hermione' is far too often played as a know-it-all: her overall performance looks a lot like that of a child actor... acting.And unfortunately, John Williams couldn't resist composing the score and boy is it loud. And unmemorable. Stick to Spielberg & Lucas, Johnny-boy. And speaking of Spielberg, this was supposed to be his film initially; when he dropped out to make the terrible 'A.I. - Artificial Intelligence,' somehow it fell into Columbus' hands (and wallet). Yep, the clown who most recently brought you 'Stepmom,' 'Bicentennial Man' and 'Nine Months' is now the owner of the biggest opening ever. Yikes.Me: At two hours and thirty-two minutes, this is awfully long for a kiddie fantasy but the first two-thirds of the film work. The ending, while unpredictable, feels lame. See you at McDonald's - I'll be the one with the Happy Meal. FiancÃ©e: Enjoyed one hundred forty-five of the one hundred fifty-two minutes of it (she disliked the troll segment).",Null,0,0,22 November 2001
The Untouchables," Utterly Fictional Script Almost Works: A Guilty Pleasure
","Brian DePalma will never have a 'DePalmaesque' attached to the synopsis of any other film ever made.The guy has made his entire living ripping off in his words, 'paying homage to'] first Hitchcock, then Scorsese and finally Welles.In this film he accomplishes all three ~ and more.Yes, it's gripping from the start, but the script is utterly fictitious. More on that later.Connery finally won his Oscar, and deservedly so, as the obstinate ex-Chicago cop mentoring the [again] miscast Costner.And DeNiro's over-the-top-of-the-world perf as Al Capone works, and makes for many memorable scenes.The cinematography is, as always, perfect ~ particularly in the epertly executed rip-off of Sergei Eisenstein's 'Medusa Steps' sequence from the brilliant 'Battleship Potemkin.'The ending is absurd, and total fiction.*** SPOILER ALERT ***In the final climactic scene, Costner [as Ness] kills Frank Nitti during the trial of DeNiro's Capone.Even the syndicated TV series from the '50s/'60s knew that Nitti succeeded Capone's throne while the latter was in prison ~ ie. he wasn't dead.Still, this is a guilty pleasure of mine.  And when it's on cable I tend to watch it again and again ~ even though I own it on VHS and DVD.Andy Garcia's and Charles Martin Smith's early performances continue to surprise me with their depth.",7,1,1,10 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," I See The Single Most Over-rated Film This Side Of 'Titanic'
","As an avid mystery film buff, I refused to read a single review of 'The Sixth Sense' ~ to the point that I wandered away when any of my friends began discussing it.That's how serious I was about trying not to accidentally stumble upon 'the big secret.'So, having missed it at the theaters, I pre~ordered the DVD and waited.And waited.Yesterday it arrived.  I decided to hold off on watching it until tonight, my birthday [shameless effort to receive multiple emailed birthday greetings].Words cannot describe my shock at having 'discovered' the 'big secret' a mere SE7EN minutes into the film.  So amazed was I that I was certain that the obvious answer must have been a red herring: surely anyone with half a brain would have determined  the incredibly obvious secret when I did.I was expecting a sock~me~in~the~gut~I~never~saw~that~coming surprise, a la 'The Usual Suspects.' Or even 'Shallow Grave.' Or at the very worst, 'Carnival of Souls' or 'Rosemary's Baby.'Nope.It was exactly as I suspected.This is a well~acted, nicely~paced, moderately~interesting thriller.Haley Joel Osment's performance is memorable and, along with Jude Law's in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' was the best of 1999's Best Supporting Actor turns.  For the first time in several years, a child actor actually delivers a riveting, completely~believable performance.  For me, the problem with young actors is that [because by definition, they *are* young] they always seem to be acting.  This kid is world~class.But contrary to popular opinion, this is decidedly *not* Bruce Willis' best work to date.  Although he's good here, that honor would go to his tortured Vietnam vet in the excellent 'In Country,' which I urge you to rent.Toni Collette does well as Osment's caring mother, but this is no Oscar~worthy turn: she's simply not around enough to serve as much more than a plot device.The famed 'I see dead people' line finally rolls around at :47 and if you haven't cracked this by then, give up and fast~forward.***SEMI~SPOILER ALERT***Disregard the reviews here which claim that if you fail to realize the importance of 'The Sixth Sense' then you just didn't get the complex dialogue.  It's not complex in the least.  At best, it's serviceable.  The story is lifted from the original 'Carnival of Souls.'  Those who want you to believe that this is the greatest horror/thriller ever haven't seen 'The Exorcist' or 'Rosemary's Baby.'Let alone 'Fallen.'
