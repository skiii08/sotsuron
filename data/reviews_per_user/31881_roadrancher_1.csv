Sucker Punch," One more step towards Lucid Dreaming Awake
","Our world is convoluted, is this game a metaphor for life? Are dreams metaphors or our god-mode selves? One reviewer suggested watching characters that almost couldn't be hurt was insulting, whereas I saw characters that could do practically anything else the cosmos offers but survive the world we have to put up with ourselves. This film is special, and, I watched it in a non-traditional way because you can only watch something for the first time, once. I have a projector, and I soaked this up over two consecutive midnights. When I stepped outside afterwards, the stars were dancing in the prismatic phase shifts I know from certain ethnobotanical ingredients. ahem'. And I was left wondering just how weird life gets, and where the accelerator pedal was on the daily grinder. Couldn't we just dance with evil so hard it explodes? This film explores realists being dreamers, and rendezvous' being more important than outcomes, not because you win but because you live by doing so. Gorgeous, stones your lizard while your guardian angel passes you a sharpened spoon in the fun-house. I really, really, hope you like it, because if you don't, I'm not going to bet on you beating the system, as your current organism.",9,1,3,25 September 2012
