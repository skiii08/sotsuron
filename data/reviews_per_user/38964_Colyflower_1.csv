The Ring," Lilo (from that annoying Lilo and Stitch show) goes evil
","I don't know if anyone noticed this, but the kid who is the voice for Lilo on Lilo and Stitch:The Series is Samara. That is kinda creepy.The movie in whole was scary, especially the peoples faces after they 'saw the ring'. It was like a giant jigsaw puzzle that needed to be pieced together. When you finally figured one part out, another sub-plot came into place and totally mixed up what you had put together. That was frustrating. But, after watching it twice, I found I finally understood it.I thought it was interesting, Rachel and Aiden's relationship. Aiden never called Rachel 'mom' or 'mommy' or whatever a young kid would call his parent, which I thought was kind of creepy, but showed independance.Overall, The Ring was a fabulous horror movie without stupid, funny parts that ruin the whole setting of the movie. 'Two thumbs up!'",Null,1,2,3 May 2004
