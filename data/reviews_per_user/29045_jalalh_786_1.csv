Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," crap film
",Borat was funny at first but as it went along it got real disappointing it just took it to far. I have heard of this type of comedy but this is way off.I don't see how may fun of religion and showing nudity could be funny. The worst thing was it was under rated so a lot of kids can see it. I really think the sensors should have had rated this higher i go past the schools and i hear them talking about Borat. I know a lot of people voted Borat high and might disagree with me but a lot of films i going ruder and badder and there are a lot of children are watching. I don't think parents should let children watch these type of films.In conclusion i think it is a bad film.,2,4,8,2 May 2007
