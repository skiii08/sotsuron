Catch Me If You Can," A Great Movie
","This movie was not at all what I expected. What I expected was a comedy and or sappy romance that was somewhat cheesy. It wasn't. In the past I had not been a big fan of Mr. Leonardos movies and I believed that he was too cocky to really portray a good and true character. In this movie I found that he could do almost anything. He can play the businessman, the caring son, the loving fianc√©, the player, and the pitiful homeless kid that just wants a family. I have seen this movie 3 times and each time I cried. I guess that my favorite thing about this movie is that you never really know what is going to happen next. You think you understand what is going to happen but you don't. I absolutely love this movie its got a little bit of everything in it. It has all of the things that you could ever ask for in a good movie, famous actors, romance, a little comedy, the cocky young hot guy that you end up feeling sorry for, and a great plot. Above all the most intriguing thing about this movie was that it was true. The story wasn't something that Hollywood dreamed up with their vivid imaginations. No it is the real live story of a living breathing persons life growing up. I was so into the movie that I actually decided to do some research on Frank Abagnale Jr. and learn more about his real life as one of the greatest bank fraud men alive.",10,2,4,29 June 2006
