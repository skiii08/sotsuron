Skyfall," Why this movie is important, and a phenomenal James Bond Movie
","Reading many of the reviews by other reviewers, began to make me confused as to what people have come to expect from a Bond movie. Speaking for myself, the baseline has always been the action. As I became older, I found myself watching the Bond movies in a new light, becoming equally interested in the story lines and the character development. However, previous Bond movies had always left me wanting something more in how Bond is portrayed. Previous Bond films, even when attempting to show the emotional side of Bond, have always left the viewer feeling as an outsider looking in. The viewer merely watched Bond and his actions and took them for what they were, there was never any deeper understanding as to what and who Bond truly was. For this reason, I began reading the Fleming novels, and that missing piece of the puzzle was found. Skyfall accomplished this as well. The James Bond portrayed in Skyfall is the closest example to Fleming's character in which he put tireless detail over 50 years ago. For the first time I saw a true man, not a superman or a super secret agent. Daniel Craig bridged this gap and brought the written James Bond into the cinema. He understands Bond. In addition, this movie carries everything that one expects from a Bond movie. The action scenes are absolutely impressive. The story is solid. If you are a Bond fan that needs a bad guy with a finger on the nuclear detonator, you may disagree. This is a simple enemy, motivated by a simple reason and looking to accomplish a simple goal. This movie is the complete package, with tasteful nostalgia that I found spectacularly used (unlike Die Another Day).",9,4,15,9 November 2012
