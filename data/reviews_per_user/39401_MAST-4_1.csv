Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The fact that this film is rating above Limbo in this database is a good indication of why viewers are upset with Limbo's ending.
","I was really disappointed when I saw 'Phantom Menace'.  Maybe it was too long since 'Star Wars' and I've grown older and wiser.  It just seemed to be a pointless cartoon.  The technology ain't there yet for replacing good actors; or any actors for that matter.If this is the kind of movie that turns on the public (Probably 99% from USA) instead of a movie like 'Limbo' (which seems to have confounded Hollywood), then we're lost.",1,0,1,8 June 1999
