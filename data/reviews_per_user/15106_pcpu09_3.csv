The Ring," Wow!!!
","To say the least this movie scared the s**t out of me. Had to be one the the scarest films that I have ever seen. I would have paid twenty bucks to see it. Please do not listen to those who talk bad about this movie because they obviously do not know their a** from a hole in the ground. This movie was frightening from beginning to end. Yes it leaves you with questions, but it is good thing, trust me. The people who say that 'The Ring' has loose ends,is not scary, and it is boring definitely have a screw loose. I highly reccommend this movie to anybody and everybody. I give it a 10 out of 10!P.S. Do not see this one alone and do not go home alone after seeing it.!",10,0,0,21 October 2002
Signs," The best movie of the year!!!
","I was so excited to see this movie after I saw the first trailer. The movie was even better than the trailer made it out to be. First of all, I am not scared easy during movies, but this one was quite frightening. I loved it. Also it was really funny as well. Very strong performances from Mel, Joaquin, and the kids and also two and half thumbs up for M. Night, what a director and writer. This movie made you scared and it made you think as well. Like do things really happen for a reason even if they are really bad. Overall it was a great film that I highly reccommend to anyone who likes a good scare. I give this movie 10 out of 10.P.S. Don't listen to these people who bad mouth this movie, they don't know what they are talkin about. Go see it!",Null,0,1,3 August 2002
A Walk to Remember," A bit of a tear jerker
","This movie definitely took me by surprise. Before watching it, I thought it was going to be just another chick flick, but I was so wrong! I am a very heterosexual male who enjoys a good violent action and hilarious comedy movie. This movie hit me like a ton of bricks in which I shedded a few tears. Mandy Moore and Shane West gave excellent performances! And Mandy Moore still looks amazing even when she is dressed like a very conservative Christian girl. She is one of those beautiful actresses and singers who do not need to wear make up or have their hair done to look gorgeous.
This movie sends out a great message and I would reccomend it to anyone. I also reccomend to everybody to keep your eyes wide open because you never know when your miracle could pass you by.I give it a 10/10.",10,0,0,28 December 2002
