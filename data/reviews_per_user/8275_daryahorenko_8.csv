Alien 3," Not even so bad that it's good
","Let's begin by talking about the opening sequence. I don't like it. The cuts are so awkward that you have no idea what's going on. With the knowledge of what happened at the end of Aliens we find out what happened a few minutes later, but the opening title sequence is just awkward. The slow motion that we see a few minutes later serves absolutely no purpose to the story (this is not the only time there's unnecessary slow motion). The voice of the prison staff member who makes the announcements is annoying. Also, why is it a prison for people with YY chromosomes? No matter how much sci-fi you throw in to this movie, this is absolutely impossible. The biological mother of a human has two X chromosomes and the biological father has an X and a Y chromosome, so where does the second Y chromosome come from? The prisoners all look like men, so why call it a YY correctional facility? And why do the jailers have the logo of Weyland-Yutani on their clothes? If you look closely you will see that the Weyland-Yutani symbol is all over the prison. Why do Weyland-Yutani have the authority to arrest criminals?As Ripley asks the exact same question I'm pretty sure the writers were aware of this, why doesn't this maximum security prison have any weapons? The movie itself acknowledges this problem, I have no idea what the writers were thinking.Something I won't blame this movie for is that Newt doesn't appear in it. For those who don't know, that's because Carrie Henn chose not to be in anymore movies. On the other hand, she's really lucky not to be in this movie because it's really really bad. And I'm really glad I didn't have to see how a child would've been treated in an environment like that.After Ripley wakes up we get a really good emotional scene. Unfortunately, we go back to the religious aspect of the prison very quickly, which really doesn't fit into the movie and slows it down. This happens so many times.I didn't care about the problems the prisoners have with each other at all. Neither did I care about any of the problems the staff members had with each other. One of the main problems with this movie is that we WANT the prisoners to die, we WANT the xenomorphs to eat them. They're rapists, murderers and child molesters, that's why we hate them and they don't deserve saving. The dialog in this movie is really really bad. There's so many lines that sound like the writers came up with them while being drunk in a bar and listened to what the other drunk people were saying. And why would Ripley want to live amongst the prisoners for a week? Why not be protected by the doctor for a week?I didn't even get to the jumpscares yet. There's so many movies the music gets louder and dramatic to tell us something scary is about to happen and then it's just a person showing up. Alien and Aliens perfectly understood not to do that.And what's with the score in this movie? It's really loud and over the top and in two scenes it's just really annoying rock music...The scene where we get our first look at the xenomorph is really bad, too. There's blood everywhere and that's it. Nothing builds up to this moment, there's no suspense, it's a scene that's supposed to be scary but it's really not. The other xenomorph attack scenes are exactly the same. It's nothing but blood. The idea that the xenomorph doesn't kill Ripley when it first has the opportunity is ridiculous and the explanation is absolutely nonsensical. She's carrying a xenomorph queen inside of her and she says that the xenomorph that's running around is not going to kill her because it won't kill any of its kind. The xenomorph running around doesn't know there's another one inside of Ripley, it can't see inside of her and none of the previous films indicate that they have some sort of x-ray vision. In fact, there's ONE shot in Alien or Aliens (I don't remember which movie, but I'd rather say Alien) where the camera shows what the xenomorph sees and its vision is just like a human's vision, just a little worse. We also get several shots from the perspective of the xenomorph in this movie and nothing indicates that they have an x-ray vision.I should also mention that the way the leader of the rescue team is dressed looks ludicrous. He wears some white plastic onesie with ridiculous glasses, he looks like he belongs in some tasteless 80s music video. Just some moments after we see him for the first time two prisoners run into each other, which is probably the most ludicrous moment in the entire movie. No, just wait a few more minutes because the xenomorph literally... blows up!? *What a great idea* What exactly did they pour on it to make it *cough cough*... explode? I guess the answer that makes the most ''sense'' is acid because we see cracks in the xenomorph's head right before it... explodes, but that doesn't make any sense either because xenomorphs have acid blood themselves and can therefore resist acid perfectly. And of course, Ripley has to die in the most clichéd way possible. And her death scene looks like utter garbage because of terrible terrible CGI. Her sacrifice was supposed to be the big moment of the movie, but it just comes off as stupid.I'm currently watching all of the Alien movies. I've seen Prometheus once and I've seen Alien: Covenant, Alien and Aliens multiple times. I own these four movies on Blu-ray. Alien and Aliens, Aliens in particular is the absolute best cinema has to offer. This movie however tries so hard to be Alien with ONE xenomorph taking out all people in a place one by one with the action of Aliens, but it fails on so many different levels. The only redeeming qualities are some good performances and I guess the xenomorphs. I rated this movie a 2/10. This is by far the worst Alien movie that I've seen so far. I haven't seen Alien: Resurrection and the Alien vs. Predator movies yet, the latter ones aren't canon.",2,0,4,27 May 2018
Beauty and the Beast," The remake is an insult to this masterpiece
","At the time the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast came out last year I haven't seen the original animated movie. I was a huge fan of the remake until the Nostalgia Critic's review destroyed it for me because he was right about almost everything and he made me realize many of the remake's flaws and he opened my eyes. Fortunately I've seen a lot of movies during the past year and I'm not that easily impressed anymore.So today I saw the animated original, which is much better than the remake from the very introduction scene. In the remake they say that the enchantress erased all memories about the residents of the castle from the minds of the people who loved them so he became forgotten, which is a hideous way to fix a plothole. This line does not exist in the original, which I liked very much. I'll get back to that later.From the moment the 'Belle' song started I started to realize just how much better this movie is. The dialog in between the strophes makes more sense, Paige O'Hara can actually sing (she's just one of many characters whose singing is much better, not only the singing is, but so is the instrumentalization of the songs, especially 'Be Our Guest'). In the remake the three alike-looking girls who fell for Gaston sing dreadfully and so does Emma Watson) and there's better camera focus on the characters who are currently singing (and the score is better in the original. It's not bad in the remake though.). Another thing that's better in this scene is that Belle doesn't get her books from a church, but from an actual bookseller because it makes absolutely no sense that a church lends non-religious books to people in the village. The sheep sitting next to Belle and biting her book is just one of many little moments that add to the movie that gives it the magic the remake doesn't have. It also makes sense how they animate Gaston. It's very odd that so many girls in town would fall for the live-action Gaston who is really not as attractive as the remake wants him to be. This movie doesn't have as much unnecessary zoom as the 2017 B&B does. Why did they use it in the new movie? Because Belle didn't stand out from the crowd because she wasn't the only one wearing blue like in the original. And I still don't have any idea why they zoomed in so much on Gaston in the new movie.Gaston is much more of a dick in the original and it makes perfect sense that Belle is afraid of him because he's a stalker. In the new movie he's just some really annoying douchebag. Gaston's plan on how to become Belle's husband is much better in the original. Instead of getting her father locked up in an asylum so she would even marry Gaston to get him out of there, the writers of the remake decided to insert a boring scene where Gaston and Lefou follow Maurice halfway to the castle until, and there's no explanation why, Gaston changes his mind, ties Maurice to a tree so Belle has no one left but Gaston... That's his 'plan' in the remake. Even Lefou's crush on Gaston is much more apparent here. Disney made such a big deal of it in the marketing of the 2017 remake, so it's pretty pathetic that they hardly got it right. In the original Gaston is much ruder and more violent towards Lefou so the fact that he's still on his side makes his crush much more apparent. In the remake Lefou even turns against Gaston in the end.Another chemistry that works much better in the remake is the one between Lumière and Cogsworth. Little moments like Lumière burning Cogsworth's arm are not in the remake. They make the original so special. Yet another moment from the 1991 version that is not in the remake is Belle's father doing all kinds of everything with Cogsworth when he first meets him. It's funny. It's adorable. In the remake they don't meet at all, the only time Belle's father meets any of the enchanted objects in that movie is him sitting at the dinner table, Chip moving towards him, saying that his mum forbade him to talk to strangers, Belle's father saying that it's alright and immediately running away from the castle. That's all we get in the remake, no fun, nothing. It's really not that great that Belle's father is afraid of the enchanted objects in the remake because there's so much chemistry in the 1991 version that make for great moments.Why is Belle's father a horologist in the new movie? It's not necessarily a bad thing but it's just an unnecessary change. The scene in the remake where we first meet him is really boring despite being much shorter and the original scene makes him much more adorable and interesting. His invention in the original (that doesn't appear in the 2017 version) is really nice, too. In the remake he's just a scatty old man. The way he gets to the castle in the 2017 B&B makes much less sense as well. I really don't like that they cut the signpost, the bats and the cliff from the new movie.In the original Chip made it possible for Belle, her father and the whole castle to be saved and he freed them before they were brought to the asylum. All of that has been cut from the remake where Belle and Maurice have freed themselves.In the remake the beast is really nice and friendly, which is the opposite of what he's supposed to be. In the original they got the beast right. In the beginning he's frightening and evil. In the remake the beast looks cute and beautiful, which was a huge mistake.Another character who's so much better in the original is Belle. In the remake she knowingly puts the whole castle at risk. In the original she doesn't know that the only way to redeem the castle is loving the beast in return. She doesn't learn that until she gets it over with. In the remake however she learns it about halfway throughout the movie, so she shouldn't hesitate trying to do something to fall in love with the beast. But that's exactly what she does, she spends so much time with the beast as if she had a lifetime.Another character that the remake turned into a lunatic is the enchantress. The remake added a whole sequence to the movie where we see the families of the residents of the castle return after the castle has been redeemed, which means the enchastress has kept families apart for ten years! This is why this movie didn't say that all memories about the people who live in the castle have been erased from the minds of those who love them, it's because those people didn't exist in the 1991 B&B!As you can see, the remake destroyed literally every single one of these amazing characters.There's so many more great moments I could point out that aren't in the remake, like the first scene in the library of the castle. There's so much nice buildup in the original and it makes for a really beautiful scene. And of course no comparison of the two movies may avoid mentioning the horrendous 'adaptation' of the date night. In the original we see the enchanted objects planning and preparing it, we get a song about them looking forward to being human again, we see them washing the beast and cutting his hair and we see Belle and the beast having dinner. What part of this remains in the remake? Nothing. All they do is dance to 'Tale as Old as Time' (which they renamed to 'Beauty and the Beast' in the remake for no reason at all) for three minutes. The whole sequence is magical in this movie, but in the remake they cut so much of it that none of that magic remains. Yet another scene that's just so much better in the original is the scene where the villagers attack the castle. In the original it's fun and entertaining, in the remake it's overly serious and trying to be suspenseful. The final confrontation between the beast and Gaston is much better, too.The animation is great. However, I have hardly seen any of the Disney fairytale classics. The only one I've seen is the Lion King and I saw that one years ago, so I can't compare the animation to the other Disney classics, but all by itself the animation looks really good. And this movie doesn't have any terrible CGI like the remake does.The main problem with the remake is that it's a whole 38 minutes longer than the 1991 B&B, which is astonishing considering how much is cut from it. There's so many unnecessary additions in the new movie that destroy the pacing. The very few things the remake does better than the original is the fact that the enchanted objects look better and more alive, I really like 'Evermore', the 'Be Our Guest' scene looks gorgeous and the remake has a very beautiful end credits sequence.The only flaw I'm having with the original is that I still wonder why the dog is enchanted. The dog didn't do anything wrong at all.The remake is not a remake, it's like a re-imagining by someone who hasn't seen the original in 25 years and hardly remembers anything. This movie however is great. Please see the original if you haven't, it's so magical. Please do NOT see the 2017 remake. And please send Disney an e-mail telling them to stop destroying their old classics in the live-action 'adaptations'.",10,2,2,1 June 2018
Moana," Sets the bar for animated movies higher
","The main reason I saw this movie is because Alessia Cara sings one of the songs. Sure, she sings it during the end credits and the same song is sung by Auli'i Cravalho during the movie, but that's the main reason I wanted to see this movie. I admire Alessia Cara, check out her songs, she's great! I also listened to some of the other songs from this movie on YouTube and I really liked them, so today I sat down and finally saw 'Moana'.I loved this movie from the beginning. The opening scene where we're told the mythological history of the island is beautiful. Little moments like Moana's scene with the baby sea turtle make her character even more adorable. Little moments like the adult sea turtle swimming next to Moana in the water, the chicken tripping and walking into the fire, the pig and more are beautiful as well and they add so much to the movie.The animation is gorgeous. Even though I didn't see it in 3D (but I would like to some day), at times you just wanted to grab into the screen. Everything in this movie looks so pretty. I saw this movie in full HD which was perfect. You could feel every single leaf of the flowers and trees and every single hair of the characters and the lighting they integrated into the animation is really nice.The soundtrack for this movie is amazing. I really like the Polynesian score, but what's really special are the songs sung by the characters, especially 'How Far I'll Go'. I might actually buy the soundtrack soon. What I don't like about lots of modern musical movies is that the lyrics are mostly irrelevant to the story, but here they are part of the story and they are meaningful.The story is great, interesting and continuously unpredictable, this movie has realistic characters, I cared about all of the main characters and I was invested in Moana's journey and the fact that she's clumsy (like me) makes her more interesting and relatable. Maui and the chicken are great comic relief while Maui is also a very serious character. This movie has a great screenplay. There's great funny and light-hearted scenes contrasting with emotional, sad, meaningful and tense scenes and the transitions don't feel abrupt. I also liked that this movie poked fun at the fact that people use 'men' as a gender-neutral word for 'humans' in one scene. The dream sequence isn't fooling us either which is a rarity these days. Another thing this movie does well is using slow motion with a purpose, there's a beautiful slow motion sequence towards the end.Another thing that I really liked about this movie is that the location is not irrelevant. The culture of the island is distinctly Polynesian and I love to see that culture being portrayed on the big screen.The voice acting is great, particularly Auli'i Cravalho is doing a great job, especially considering that this was her movie debut. I like that they cast voice actresses and actors that match what you think the characters would sound like.This movie also has a great message about people not being what they seem like on first sight, but actually being really beautiful inside even though you might not see it at first, it has a great message about believing in yourself and it has a great message about forgiving.I have a few flaws with this movie on first viewing, mostly little things that don't make sense but don't really have an impact on the story, like some gimmicks in the animation that don't make sense if you think about them, but they're pretty little moments which enhance the movie in the long run. Also, it's unlikely that Moana is doing that well escaping the pirates' arrows. And Moana has no access to food and water while she's off the island, yet she's never shown to be hungry or thirsty. I think the movie started off really good, but I thought the monster character who appeared an hour into the movie was really boring. Fortunately it's only in the movie for a few minutes. In the long run, 'Moana' is a great movie with flaws. The second act was good, the first act was great and the third act was just beautiful. It was a little boring towards the middle, but the middle part that I didn't like is so short that I'm not going to downgrade it because of that and I give it a 10/10. I hardly ever felt that invested in the characters, emotional and at times even tense in an animated movie. This definitely sets my bar for my ratings of animated movies higher.",8,0,2,30 May 2018
Alien," As close to perfect as movies get
","Alien is one of my favorite movies. In fact, it might even be my #1. There's three movies that are pretty much tied for my #1 spot and Alien is one of them and not just because I'm a fan of science fiction and science fiction horror. This might be THE best science fiction movie ever.This is a very unique movie and I can't really compare it to any movie outside the Alien franchise. The idea of an alien monster growing inside your body, planted there by what they call a facehugger that has acid blood that attaches itself to your face after jumping out of a giant egg-like spore is so unique and fascinating. I'll get back to that, but for now let's analize some the other elements of the movie.The cinematography of this movie is amazing. The lighting is flawless. When they're exploring the ship that sent the distress signal it might be too dark to see things clearly, but it makes for a realistic setting because the only light in this location is coming from thr crew's lamps. The pseudo-sexual imagery on the walls of said ship adds a creepy feeling to the scene. But the truly fascinating ship is the one our crew is using to return to earth, especially the inside looks great and it looks like a real environment that people actually live in. It looks so polished but used up at the same time. The editing in this movie is great as well, there's so many times we cut to the next shot at the perfect time, which basically happens throughout the entire movie.The acting is top-notch, especially the performance by Sigourney Weaver deserves a lot of praise. There's not a single dull moment of acting, not one. I also really like the characters. At first I thought the subplot that Ash is a robot wasn't really necessary, but his 'death scene' made for a very scary moment and his last lines gave a lot more depth to his character. I also like the fact that all of the characters are individual people and not just 'the team', which leads to several argument scenes that I really like and you always side with Ripley, because she's the reasonable one who tries to keep everyone safe. What I like most about Ripley is that she's highly aware of her responsibilities and that she's fearless. Even though Alien is the superior movie by a tidbit, she's even better in Aliens.I said I'd get back to the spores, facehuggers and xenomorphs and I am getting back to them right now. Each of these creatures, and they get unveiled in the order I just named them is more mysterious and menacing than the previous one. The spores, especially with their slimy inside are gross in a great way and intriguing, so you understand why Kane is so curious about it and touches one of them. The facehugger is menacing. We're stuck with it for a considerable time of the movie and it makes us as the viewers concerned with the characters, especially with Kane. Its design is awesome and it works well as a 'character' because it's an unknown entity to our human characters. I think that the fact that it has acid blood was added in order to fix the plothole that the crew could just kill it, but it doesn't come off that way because it makes the facehugger even more creepy and gross and because it turns the facehugger into an actual dangerous object. But the best creature in this movie is the xenomorph. That thing is so perfect! The way it gives birth is disturbing, it's an incredible antagonist, and obviously the xenomorph doesn't have a single line, but considering that it's one of the best antagonists to ever be put on screen without saying a single line just shows how well it works. The design is hands down without a doubt the best Alien design I've ever seen in a movie, it looks incredibly unique, slimy and most of all, extremely fear-inducing, menacing and SCARY. Speaking about scary, the first scene where we see the xenomorph emerging from Kane is scary as hell, even though the xenomorph is just a baby in that scene, even though it only makes two or three sounds and even though we only see it for a few seconds until it disappears. The next time we see it it's grown to its full scale and the scene is scary, too, and again, we only see it for a couple of seconds, later we get one very good shot of it that lasts less than a second. The fact that the xenomorph is hardly in the movie creates so much suspense and it keeps us waiting for the big reveal. All of those amazing short scenes and I didn't get into all of them build up to the finale which I absolutely love. The score highlights this incredibly suspenseful movie even more. This is a have-to-see movie, check it out as soon as possible if you haven't!",10,1,4,21 May 2018
Aliens," Aliens > Alien > Other Movies
","Aliens > Alien
I don't wanna make Alien sound bad, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. EVER. And it just gets better on rewatching. Alien was directed by Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors. Aliens was written and directed my James Cameron, also one of my favorite directors. Both are suspenseful beyond your imagination. While Alien is a little better than Aliens in regards to story and originality, these are just some of the reasons Aliens is superior to Alien:
1) It introduces my favorite Alien character, Rebecca 'Newt' Jorden. It's the only Alien movie she appears in and she has a LOT of screentime in Aliens. Carrie Henn was an amazing casting choice for her character. She gives one of the best, if not the best child performance I've ever seen in a movie (and yes, I've seen The Shining and I know that Danny Lloyd is amazing in it. You can feel her emotions through every ounce of her facial expressions, voice and actions. It's so so sad that she didn't pursue an acting career.
2) They got Ripley even better than in Alien. I love how James Cameron always puts very strong women in his movies and she is such a badass in Aliens.
3) Alien doesn't have a twist like Alien does. The twist that there's a xenomorph queen is awesome. I thought that xenomorphs are the coolest-looking creatures in all of science fiction, but this thing looks even better!
4) Alien has a great finale, but the finale of Aliens is the absolute best and I couldn't take my eyes away both times I saw it.
5) Aliens contains my favorite line from the entire saga: 'Get away from her, you bitch!'
6) Despite not having something like a big theme, the score of Aliens is even better than the score of Alien.Aliens is the best movie of all time in my opinion.
And now that I've seen both the theatrical version and the director's cut I can say that the theatrical version is better. I like the director's cut's addition that Ripley has a daughter who died while she was in hypersleep, but I like that Rebecca's first scene is not in the theatrical version. It slows the movie down a little bit.",10,1,3,26 May 2018
Alien vs. Predator," Terrible, yet better than 'Alien: Resurrection'
","I know that the AvP aren't canon to either franchise, but there's so many things that don't make sense in regards to the Alien universe, like the movie takes place in 2004 and Mr. Weyland is played by the same actor who played Bishop in Aliens. It doesn't help that he's called 'Charles Bishop Weyland' in the movie.That's not the only things that don't make sense. 1) When we first see our main character she's climbing up a frozen cliff on a mountain. There's a wide shot where we clearly see that there's nothing but snow on the plateau above. By the time she gets there there's a helicopter and its pilot up there who... flew there without her noticing!? 2) Mr. Weyland gives his speech at the briefing while standing on a bridge inside the ship's hangar BEHIND the characters 3) Our main character and I will just call her by her name Alexa Woods (*great name*) from now on is taking a helicopter to fly to the icebreaker where the team is located. Why not land the helicopter on the ship while it's still in a harbor and save gas? 4) It's never explained why Alexa decides to stay on the ship.The story of this movie is really not that special. Who thought it would be a good idea to make this a archeology movie? In the beginning we go from one place to another over and over again within minutes. 'Rogue One' did the same, but in that movie it worked because the things that happened in those different places were actually relevant to the story. Here they're not.All of the actresses and actors except Lance Henriksen are really bad in both their line delivery and facial expressions. The acting is better than the 'acting' in 'Alien: Resurrection' though.Let's talk about the 'characters'. We're supposed to care about Alexa the most, yet we don't know anything about her. Oh well we do, there's a ludicrous ATTEMPT of an emotional scene where we find out about the story with her dad. We're supposed to care about Graeme, yet all we know about him is that he's OBSESSED with taking photos to the point where it gets really annoying. This is my first Predator movie. In this movie they do nothing but kill humans and xenomorphs. The xenomorph queen looks amazing of course, but why is there visible electricity all around her? And she's tied up, laying spores/eggs, whatever you want to call them but I'd rather call them spores because that's what it says in the menu of my Alien Blu-ray, similar to 'Alien: Resurrection', where the xenomorphs are caged. This movie takes so long to get to the point which makes it really boring. Aliens did that, too, but it worked because the team we spent our time with was interesting and they were good characters. The human characters in this movie are hollow, boring and uninteresting and they suck at acting. They are really dumb as well. Once they're trapped in the pyramid they decide to enter its even lower levels.Once we get the facehuggers they jump out of the spores in slow motion for some reason. That was absolutely pointless. There's a lot of overuse of slow motion in this movie.In the original 'Alien' there was quite some time between the facehugger leaving the host's face, the host waking up and the xenomorph bursting out of the person's chest. In this movie it's taking minutes or even seconds. The moments we've all been waiting for, the xenomorph and predator fighting look like garbage. It's just shaky cam, which is a shame because they have really good xenomorph props and the predators look really cool, too. And why can xenomorphs fall through the floors of the pyramid? I don't think they're THAT heavy. By the way, why can't the xenomorph queen outrun a human?And there's no way I can review this movie without mentioning the jumpscares. For example there's a scene where we're made to think a xenomorph is about to show up but it's a penguin. SECONDS earlier Alexa touches Graeme from behind with the most clichéd loud music.This was my first Paul W. S. Anderson movie and everyone says his movies are terrible and he's a terrible director and this movie was written by him as well, so I was very concerned about what I was going to see. And here's my opinion: He's a bad director, but he's even worse as a screenplay writer. What I hate most about his writing is that there's so many exposition scenes. Or maybe it's the stupid twist that the character have to team up with the predators. It's ridiculous when they say 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'.I think Pepsi and National Geographic regret their product placements.Oh and the credits go on for TWELVE MINUTES.",1,1,2,29 May 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," A perfect-looking masterpiece of science fiction
","This is hands down one of the most special movies I've ever seen. Despite the fact that the story is pretty good, what really makes it so outstanding comes to live in the cinematography, which is so good, there's so many beautiful shots, even in the beginning where there's no CGI. This movie looks top-notch amazing! Yhe sets are perfect, and I know it's sets, but it all looks like they're in real space ships, like they're actually in space, like they're in an actual savannah. Despite being released in 1968, this movie looks almost perfect and it's tied with another 1968 movie for the oldest movie I've ever seen, but despite all that, it looks gorgeous! The score is really great as well, the main theme is memorable andit seemed familiar and it tells us we're in for something extraordinary. I also like that they used classical music in the first half of the movie, it's so calming and the music in the second half of the movie, which I should call noises, make for a mystical vibe. The use of silence in later shots in outer space make those scenes even more gorgoes.I have some flaws with this movie though. At first I thought that the antagonist is Hal, the dictator-like arrogant computer, but then I realized it's the off-screen aliens. I don't really like the face that we have off-screen antagonists. Also, I thought that the intermission was entirely pointless. And a minor flaw is that I would've liked to spend some more time with the chimpanzees in the opening sequence.I'm a 100% certain that George Lucas and Irvin Kershner were heavily inspired by this movie. There's so many things in this movie that resemble 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back', especially visual elements, such as the outside of the ships, and I saw two or three similar shots in 'Alien', too. Also, there's a shot on the lunar surface that resembles the shot in 'Revenge of the Sith' right before we see Yoda medidating being interrupted by Bail Organa.If someone else made this movie it would be like an hour long without all the elongated shots, but it would lose so much, it would hardly be special anymore.I'll go watch the sequel immediately, I have sooo many questions, this movie leaves you thinking! I highly recommend it!",10,2,3,18 May 2018
Jurassic Park," Very well written and executed, yet underwhelming
","This was my first movie from the Jurassic Park/World franchise and after this experience I'm planning to see the sequel 'The Lost World'. This was quite a good movie, however it has some issues.Now that the fifth movie of this franchise has just hit theaters it might not seem that way as much anymore and I wasn't alive in 1993, but this was a very original idea, mostly executed very well. The script had many strength, a few weeknesses and great dialog.The first act of this movie sets up a great, interesting and intriguing world. The buildup to the first time we see a dinosaur is so well done using great cuts between the characters and good camera angles. Our two main protagonists are paleontologists and they sold their amazement of seeing real dinosaurs for the first time so well! There's a scene where what looks like a T-Rex hatches from its egg and it looks cute at first but they foreshadow the danger that is to come using really good dialog and character interactions.The second act is underwhelming, it has two strengths however. We know that one of the employees of the Jurassic Park hacks the security systems, but the idea is executed much better than it looks on paper. We also get the first scene where a dinosaur is an immediate threat to our characters, which is one of my favorite scenes from the movie. Despite that, the fact that the dinosaurs weren't in the movie that much until the third act make them seem like a little bit less of a threat.The third act on the other hand is great and it did most things right. It had great action, yet not too much of it, a great finale and my favorite scene. There were two scenes intercut , which meant that one group of characters was not aware of the consequences of their actions while the other one isn't aware of the danger they were in, those two scenes being intercut made for so much suspense.The special effects are very very good and ILM did a great job with them, as always. The dinosaurs look so gorgeous, every part of them looks real. There wasn't a single poorly done piece of CGI, not one.The main message of the movie is that humanity might be orchestrating their own extinction and that we should be careful with what we use science for, but there's also a message telling us that nature will have its revenge if we don't treat it with respect and it's very well-integrated, but they don't portray nature, especially the dinosaurs as purely evil, they show that nature can be both dangerous and peaceful.Most of the characters are realistic people you care about and you want them to survive. It's not their profession that makes the two paleontologists so great, it's their concerns about the whole idea and their actions and the fact that they try to save everyone. Scenes like the kids being so interested in their work is what endears us to them and what makes us root for them. And I know that we're not supposed to like the park owner, but he's my biggest flaw with this movie. In the third act we see three of our characters working on their plan, so the movie should let us think that he's becoming reasonable which would be good character development, but he literally tells Ellie, one of the paleontologists, not to do something because she's a woman and that he should do it because he's a man. This was a very bad decision in the script, especially because we're that far into the movie. How are we supposed to at least support that character? This movie wasn't released in the 70s or 80s when moments like this were unfortunately accepted amongst the public.All of the actresses and actors are giving really good performances, especially Samuel L. Jackson even though he wasn't in the movie that much. I always praise kids though when they are doing well in movies because giving great performances at a young age is a higher accomplishment than doing so as an adult. Ariana Richards is doing an amazing job, even when she doesn't speak, her face expresses so much of the fear that her character is experiencing and her screams of pain are even more convincing than those of Carrie Henn from 'Aliens'.",9,2,3,4 June 2018
