The Blair Witch Project," Don't waste your time
","Honestly, I only watched it,because of the recently made game of the story, and I was curious what was the fuss about it. I still don't understand why it get a 6.5 rating in here.
So, the camera work was pretty much disturbing tho,that every time when something interesting suppose to happen, they just pulled the camera from the spot, and showed the ground or the edge of sthing. I know that in the story the kids were filming, and I did accept that all the camera job were shaky and my stomac went upside down even in front of my tv screen. But the characters were dumb af, and the whole story was..boring, and the ending is lame. So in my opinion, just do not waste your time, there are much more vetter ones than this.
