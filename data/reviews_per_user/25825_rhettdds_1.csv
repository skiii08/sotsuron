Skyfall," This movie is a giant steaming pile of crap. Sorely disappointed
","Where to begin? I was really looking for to this movie with high hopes that it was going to be far better than first two crappy cliché movies. I was sorely mistaken. Right from the get-go this movie was horrible. Horrible one-liners throughout (I mean horrible!). Bad acting. Bad Plot. Not even Javier Bardem could save this movie. M, or as she should be call, Lizard Face, was terrible. Every line out her mouth was just pure crap. I mean not only was it not funny, childish, and cliché', but she acts about as good as Daniel Radcliff in Harry Potter 1. Not even Adele's open song was good! I love Adele and her music and voice are amazing! But the song wasn't good. Not even a little bit. Well, maybe a little bit, but that's it. Craig did the best he could do, but his lines were just garbage. The whole movie was utterly pointless. The bad guy's plan was to set up this insanely complex ruse (not original though- quite similar to the Joker's in the Dark Knight) just to get revenge on someone. Just utterly lame. Plus, it totally ignores the first part of the movie which is the missing hard drive. Did they forget that part during filming, or do they just think the audience is retarded and won't think about it? Q, wow. What a dumb ass character. He acts about as good as my 10 year old son. His lines have got to go down in history as poorer verbal intercourse than anything out of Star Wars 1,2,or 3. Here's an example, paraphrased, 'There's only like 6 people in the world who could've written computer code this good.' Bond, 'Can you?' Q, 'I invented it.' Followed by stupid ass smirks from both actors. I mean wow. Really? Did he just really say that? I wanted to punch him in his ugly face so hard! Just horrible film making. And it was like this from beginning to end. If I could compare this movie to something else, it was be on the lines of something like Battlefield Earth. Out of of 144 minutes, I was entertained for about 12. Thanks for nothing guys. Next time I want to see a Bond film, I think I'll just watch Archer instead.",3,25,54,27 October 2012
