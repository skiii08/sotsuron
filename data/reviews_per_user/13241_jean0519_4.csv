Moneyball," See it. Now.
","There are good baseball movies (Bull Durham), bad baseball movies (Mr. Baseball), and mediocre baseball movies (Field of Dreams. Sorry.). This is a terrific baseball movie, even more so because it's a true story. Billy Beane is a failed major-leaguer who becomes General Manager of the Oakland As, a team whose budget is in the basement and whose best players have been stolen by better teams. Billy challenges orthodox scouting policy, and hires an economist who gathers stats to put together a team of under-achievers, based on their statistical potential. More than a sports movie, this is a film that illustrates how loyalty and desperation result in a leap of faith to change the lives of the players, management, and the entire city of Oakland. And it's true. Brad Pitt gives his absolute best performance (remember Benjamin Button? Lame in comparison). Jonah Hill as the statistician leaves his stoner- loser persona behind and actually does some quality work.Oscars all around!",Null,0,1,7 October 2011
Whip It," Inspiring + Heartwarming = Kind of Boring
","I love Drew Barrymore, Kirsten Wiig, and especially Ellen Page. Drew is adorable, Kirsten is hilarious, and Ellen is adorable, hilarious, and is a really great actor (forget Juno. Watch Hard Candy.) I was really looking forward to this movie, and was really disappointed. The action scenes were great, and they're all good skaters, but the plot was predictable and tedious. Was there ever a question that she would be allowed to go to the finals? (see Bend it Like Beckham, a far superior film which had the same outcome). And what was that underwater nonsense about? I guess it was supposed to be beautiful and balletic, but left me breathless because I wondered when they'd come up for air.Although the movie was a C+, I did enjoy Marcia Gay Harden's three-dimensional portrayal of the over-protective southern Mom. I especially appreciated the realistic portrayal of the parents. Too many movies play the parents as clueless, stupid, and/or narrow-minded. These parents loved their daughters and showed it.",6,6,13,12 October 2009

","I walked into this movie expecting a typical 'Fast and Furious' no-brainer. I was caught off-guard and was completely mesmerized by the pace, the suspense, and the European-style direction. The minimalist dialogue and the 'jump-out-of-your-seat' violence knocked my socks off. Ryan Gosling plays the lead as a conflicted, tortured, possibly Aspergian protagonist who falls for his neighbor, but resorts to extreme violence when he feels threatened. The only caveat is that Carey Mulligan is under-used. She is a terrific actress and her few scenes are powerful and wrenching, Albert Brooks is a revelation. Remember him in Broadcast News? Lost In America? Mother? This is a whole different actor. He's menacing and terrifying and may be getting an Oscar for this.",8,3,7,25 September 2011
Sinister," Meh
","Ethan Hawke? Actor? Author? Director? What did he see in this? The first two thirds were really excellent. Lots of suspense, jolts, mystery and twists. I even bought the supernatural aspects of the plot. Then it got derivative, disappointing, and predictable. Ethan Hawke plays a writer looking for the next great story and moves his family into a home where a horrible crime occurred and a child disappeared. His kids start acting strange, he finds some old movies that depict possibly-related murders, he starts drinking and not sleeping, then discovers the attic full of vermin and more snuff films. The ending is telegraphed an hour before it happens, our hero's actions come too little, too late, and I'm bored just writing about it. Maybe a viewing on Netflix, but don't waste your money at the theater.",5,1,3,23 October 2012
