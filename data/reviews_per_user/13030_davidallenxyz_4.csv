"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," So bad I had to switch it off!
","I am genuinely shocked at the number of good to excellent reviews this film has received.What hurts me more than the formulaic and juvenile humour, the market- researched casting and the slow pacing is that Simon Pegg, co-creator of the legendary 'Spaced' and 'Shaun of the Dead' was involved in it. Is this really what he wants to do? I wonder whether the Brit-slacker- humour was all a facade for his desperation to become a Hollywood film star...Take one pasty faced Brit. Add an unfeasibly beautiful baby-mother that he dumped at the altar (!), add a token American love rival, insert cameos from funny-blokes-off-the-telly-doing-something-like-that-thing- they-do-on-the-telly, clich√©d Brit-cussing, a Friend-ly anglophile director, and what do you get? A bit of leaden humour, a bit of heartwarming nonsense, and another pitiful effort by the British lottery funding industry - sorry, film industry - to create an international hit.Run, everybody, run.That being said, I had to turn the film off halfway through, it was that shameful. Perhaps the finale is a laugh-a-minute? Somehow I doubt it.",2,6,12,7 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A messy conclusion to a legendary series
","Action does not need to be rushed.Science fiction does not need to be far-fetched.Story matters. So does acting.Cut out half of the content and tidy up the storytelling and this could have been a good finale.Sadly, it's the worst of the new trilogy by some margin.",4,2,7,24 December 2019
Little Miss Sunshine," Overrated and frankly more than a little disturbing
","Once again I find myself watching a highly rated movie and thinking to myself 'is that it?' when the credits roll.Little Miss Sunshine has been widely heralded as a 'heartwarming comedy' and other apparently appealing phrases.However the truth is that there are almost no real laughs, and your heart will be swiftly chilled by the final scene.I won't put in a spoiler but the beauty pageant makes for very uncomfortable viewing indeed. As an attempt at satire and subversion it is well wide of the mark.Until then the film slowly builds into a low-key yet fairly touching story of a family who grow closer on a road trip as the pillars of their lives slowly collapse. The humour is wry rather than laugh out loud. However this is nothing that you would not find in any well made TV drama.What does stand out though are the performances. Young Abigail Breslin is excellent as Olive and Alan Arkin's supporting role as the grandfather steals the show.",3,0,3,4 January 2008
Sin City," One of the few films to truly create a new language in cinema
","Devastatingly stylish yet extremely violent and with a fetishised view of female sexuality this is a spectacular film.The monochrome comic-book visuals drive the story along with rare and intense splashes of colour to complement the gritty dialogue and performances.Effectively the film is three vignettes, stories from the soaked streets of Basin City, in a reality that could be today.The strongest performance is by Mickey Rourke as the tough Marv, punching his way through every scene. Bruce Willis plays cop Hartigan with conviction, but Clive Owen is less convincing as Dwight. This is not a film for a twisted Englishman, American muscle is what it takes. However Dwight's story is perhaps the most authentic, the others wandering a little too far into fantasy violence.The female cast manage to bring depth to what are superficially roles based on arousing lust and caution, in particular Brittany Murphy as waitress Shellie. Although the film kneels at the altar of female power, it isn't about female empowerment. Sin City remains fundamentally a man's world.Recommended if you have the stomach for what is without a doubt a standout piece of extreme cinema.",8,0,2,7 January 2008
