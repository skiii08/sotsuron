Insidious: Chapter 2," Some good moments, but rather poor and confusing.
","After being a fan of the first movie, I was looking forward to the sequel. But alas, I left feeling let down. Sure, it had some good scary moments, but the story was poor, rather confusing. Too many shock tricks than real psychological scary moments, which is lazy on the part of the writer and director.And the very ending which signalled a 3 movie (god forbid) was just silly. The dead medium had killed the 'demon' outright, but it seems the demon might be back AGAIN. Come off it! And the scenes seems a bit muddled when the lead was being 'taken over' by the old man.I have seen worse, but I have certainly seen better horror movies.",5,0,0,16 January 2014
Fury," OK, good in places, but not as good as S.P.Ryan
","Started well, good actions scenes (apart from stupid shooting the POW in the back scene), Shia LeBeouf was excellent, but sadly I wanted to scream by the end.The last action sequences of Brad Pitt being Brad Pitt the Hollywood ALl American superhero fending off a division of SS combat troops was Hollywood nonsense at it's worse.One panzerfaust would have destroyed the tank but oh no, this is Hollywood.And Brad Pitt the superhero was shot by a sniper point blank 4 times and yet he managed to crawl back into the tank to sound off the usual war hero clich√©s at the end. Could have been a great war movie, but never got there in the end.I was laughing at the end.",7,1,5,26 February 2015
Bird Box," Interesting but underwhelming. Great first 30 minutes or so then went downhill.
","First 30mins were v.good, set the mood, used the flashback device to tell how it started, sort of. Reminded me of The Mist but not as good. So many unanswered questions. Who were the ghosts/spirits/creatures? It started in Romania and Russia? Was it a Putin biological attack that gone bad?Were they aliens from planet Zlopadop? Who knows? Why could some survive without covering their eyes while others killed themselves instantly? If birds could live, does that mean this thing affected only humans? Why didn't we see a single animal then? No cats, no dogs, not even a cockroach.How could you sail a river and drive a car around streets strewn with bodies, debris, vehicles blindfolded? A sat nav? Oh please. Where were the Army? Why couldn't the creatures just break a window to get the survivours?You didn't really care about the characters, and the pacing was slow, could have cut lot of dialogue and got on with the story. John Malkovich and Sandra Bullock stood out for me. Better than average sci-fi end of the world movie but nothing special.",5,1,3,28 December 2018
The Witch," Was expecting great horror but what a let down.
","I was looking forward to this. At long last a great horror that will keep you on the edge pf your seat...or so I thought. Wrong.The good points: the first 30 minutes was good, the natural lighting was great, the look of the film was authentic and acting excellent. That said the main problem with this is the pace, slow and dull, and I mean SLLLLOOOWWW.Luckily I could fast forward the long boring dull bits otherwise in a cinema I'd have walked out. It's more a pretentious religious docu-drama with a touch of supernatural thrown in rather than a 'horror'. A classic? 10 out of 10? No way!! Would I watch it again? Nope.",3,4,8,16 December 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," The best war movie I've seen since Saving Private Ryan.
","Wow, simply wow. Where to start with the best world war 2 movie since Saving Private Ryan? Andrew Garfield plays conscientious objector Desmond Doss in a true story, his performance is wonderful. The beautiful Teresa Palmer plays his girl and later wife so well. The rest of the cast is perfect in their roles. The war scenes of the Battle of Okinawa are brutal yes like the great Saving Private Ryan but that's war. The theme of pacifism v war is superbly played out. The Japanese came across as suicidal maniacs yet brave soldiers. I was never bored for one minute. It's just a classic film, I guarantee it will leave you stunned at the end. If this doesn't win an Academy Award then they should just cancel it forever.",10,3,7,3 February 2017
