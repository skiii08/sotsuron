Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best of the Indiana Jones series and one of the all time greatest!
","This is by far and away the best movie in a trilogy of great movies. After establishing the fact that Indiana is a likable and yet not immortal hero, that the suspense never stops and that the characters still have room to be developed, there are two other things that really make this movie incredible.First, Marion Ravenwood is the best heroine of the series. If there's a possible rip against the next two, it is her absence. She is tough and aware of the events, and yet she is still beautiful and perfectly ladylike. It might seem like somewhat of a contradiction, but to anyone whos seen it, they know what I'm talking about. Elsa Scheider and Willie Scott of the later movies simply don't match up to Marion.Second, the movie is incredibly clever in that Indiana, despite all the trouble he faces, has absolutely no impact on the outcome. He could have told the government to shove it, and it would not have mattered. The Nazis eventually open the Ark, only to find that to be a somewhat gruesome thing. Its a funny irony, that the artifact they are so desperately looking for is better left untouched. Some might see this as bad, but I thought it was an interesting twist, and it does NOT ruin the movie at all. Besides, all the action and humor leading up to that point should more than make up for anyone who disliked that aspect.Either way, this movie is, IMO, the greatest of all time, a real must see!PS, I've just seen some negative reviews, and just like it was with When Harry Met Sally, most of the whiners seem to be coming from foreign countries, like France and Germany (who of course have a long history of popping out excellent movies...lol). None of them seem to have any good reason to rip the movie except that they're disappointed to see their own people getting beat up on. Oh, jealousy...",10,0,0,6 April 2006
When Harry Met Sally...," The best romcom of all time
","First, I got to say that I think its funny how over half of the poor reviews of this movie were by foreigners. Its the same anti-American sentiment and jealousy that pervades the rest of the world. But its OK, we forgive you...no one is perfect.As for the movie, it is excellent. It is cute, and funny, and clever, and yet its not a complete chick flick. Now, if you're a guy, don't get the guys together and watch this one. But if you're with a girl, or by yourself, this is an excellent choice.I would give more, but everything I could say has already been said. Majority usually does rule, and in this case, it will be obvious once you have seen the movie.Also, for the person who scorned Billy Crystals mannerisms, pfffffft! Its a movie! Enjoy it...its not a dating service...",Null,0,3,8 April 2006
Jaws," Smile you son of a...!!!!!!!
","This is one of the greatest movies of all time. One of the greatest parts about this movie is that it is so simple. Sorry, but as cool as some thrillers are, life is not chock-full of twists and turns. Life is actually pretty simple. Which is what this movie is. You can start watching it at any time and you will get the same enjoyment. The only thing you need to know is that there is a killer shark, and these three men have set out to kill it. Its so incredibly simple, and yet perfectly elegant. And even without the plot twists that abound in other movies, this movie has so much suspense. Its Spielberg at his finest.Now, one of my favorite parts about writing reviews for the classics is to make fun of the people who didn't like it. This one was particularly interesting, since there were a few critics who had the gall to place Deep Blue Sea above this movie. Someone said the sharks in DBS had a reason to be aggressive. Right, like the therapy they were on gave them PMS or something. Get real! Yes, sharks don't usually eat people, but sometimes they take a liking to human flesh. In fact, Jaws is based off of real events, the Matowan sharks attacks of 1916. It doesn't get any more reasonable than that. Jaws is a heck of a lot more realistic than DBS. To compare the two is laughable, and murders any credibility.So, ignore that crap, and go see this movie, because it was a classic then and its a classic now.",10,1,3,9 April 2006
