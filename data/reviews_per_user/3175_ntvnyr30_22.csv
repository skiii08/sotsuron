The Avengers," Impressive, most impressive
","I was waiting for this film and was not disappointed. My 10 rating does not place it in the same class as 'The Godfather', 'Citizen Kane' et al. This is the 'Citizen Kane' of superhero movies.When I was a kid, my friend and I used to argue about which was better: Marvel or D.C. I used to complain that the Avengers fought amongst each other too much, instead of the 'Justice League of America' who fought their foes more harmoniously. I think the former is probably more realistic, since all these egos on one team cannot work in complete harmony. There is a good scene where they are all bickering and challenging each other.This film is not only action-packed, but there are some very funny scenes--more funny than any of today's supposed 'comedies'. The Hulk has many comic moments which is ironic since the two 'Hulk' films were somewhat disappointing.Robert Downey Jr. also has many good lines, better than in 'Iron Man 2'.This is a wonderfully entertaining film, which is a rarity these days. I highly recommend seeing this film. Also, while there are some violent scenes, it is more viewable for the kids than 'The Dark Knight'.My friend was right all along, the Marvel characters are much more exciting as a team than their D.C. counterparts, although I would love to see a live-action 'Justice League of America'.",10,1,4,4 May 2012
Miracle," Patriotic film!
","It's nice to see a film that is patriotic and that doesn't bash our great nation. I've noticed scenes in other films (i.e. 'In the Line of Fire' 'Chaplin') where characters intimated that this nation is evil. Although we are great, that doesn't mean we are perfect. Yet we are the first ones to admit and attempt to atone for our past mistakes.I am a huge hockey fan. It is the most exciting sport, especially live (I have to laugh at the yahoos who called hockey 'boring'. These are the same people who believe a car going 'round and 'round a track is exciting). Herb Brooks coached my favorite team, the N.Y. Rangers. It is one of my life regrets that I did not see the U.S.-Soviet game--I was home and was watching something else. But I did see the Gold Medal game.I thought Kurt Russell's portrayal was outstanding. The hockey scenes were outstanding in their detail. Although I read that it did not actually happen, I loved the scene where Mike Eruzione yells that he plays for the USA.The drawback for me was hearing that failed one-term president Jimmy Carter's malaise speech---which instead of being inspiring, blamed the American people for his failings as a president. Oh yes, those halcyon days of double-digit unemployment, inflation and mortgages--which coined a new phrase 'misery index' were truly memorable until Ronald Reagan took the reigns and reversed course.And I'm glad the Soviets weren't portrayed as lovable bears either. The world has suffered hundreds of million deaths at the hands of world communism, and I'm glad this film didn't portray them as lovable 'Reds'.",8,0,0,19 November 2005
Shakespeare in Love," Deserved Best Picture
","Many people bring up this picture as the epitome of an inappropriately-awarded Oscar. I disagree wholeheartedly. I can think of more egregious examples off the top of my head ('Forrest Gump', 'American Beauty').This film was expertly crafted, as the reality of Shakespeare's writing his classic love story was interwoven with his personal love life. Such an innovative plot almost deserves an Oscar for that alone. Despite the underlying love story, it's not so syrupy that you lose interest. The film is also a parody on Hollywood and the concessions made on productions. For example, the major money contributors are given roles in the play, despite their qualifications.This is a fun, romantic film with great performances all around. Give me a film with British actors anytime rather than the dimwits we have in America. Such a great cast!---Dame Judy Dench, Joseph Fiennes, Jim Carter, Simon Callow, Rupert Everett (in a cameo), Tom Wilkinson and above all, Geoffrey Rush (not a Brit but close). Rush is hilarious and has the best comic lines in the film. The same year he was in one of my favorite films 'Elizabeth' as he shows his range in playing a serious role--which he nailed.Gwenneth Paltrow's Oscar was well-deserved--as was Dench's.The music is extremely uplifting and definitely adds to the buoyancy of the film.This is a funny, romantic film for adults and is well worth your time.",10,3,5,23 November 2009
Elizabeth," Modern Classic!
","This is such a wonderful film in all respects. It is visually exciting, well-directed, and exceptionally well-acted. Cate Blanchett was astounding. Geoffrey Rush is such a great actor and did a superlative job in this film. I can't believe he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Consider the total opposite performance he gave in 'Shakespeare in Love.' Also notable was Christopher Eccleston as the bombastic, arrogant and ambitious Norfolk, who covets Elizabeth's throne.I know people have questioned its veracity but to tell you the truth, I can't say I know enough about Britain's monarchs to give an opinion.I can watch this film over and over and it is still fresh. I can't wait for the sequel.",10,0,2,12 February 2006
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I really wanted to like this film
",'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' may be the definitive spy film for some but I found it meandering and slow in parts. It's a pity because the cast is absolutely stellar. However even these great actors couldn't save this film. Perhaps a different director could have made this film better.,5,1,1,30 March 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Good film, but the first was better
","Don't believe the hype. I heard one reviewer declare that this is the best Marvel film. 'The Avengers' was the best Marvel film--I felt that before and after I left the theater.Captain America is a bit too serious and on the verge of being cranky in this film. Scarlett Johansen looked a bit too gaunt. She--along with Morgan Freeman and Sam Jackson--has suffered from overexposure in films. I'm frankly tired of seeing her. I also couldn't watch Robert Redford without wondering how horribly he has aged. Stan Lee's cameo was funny.This film had little of the first film's charm--and patriotism for that matter. The best scene was in the elevator when Captain America beat up a bunch of would-be assassins.In summary, this was good but nowhere as good as the first film and certainly this was not the best Marvel film. I noticed that the newer generation of Marvel films (IM3, Thor 2, CA2) were distinctly inferior compared to their respective predecessors. I shudder to think with such a trend what the second installment of 'The Avengers' holds.",7,0,6,4 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The title should be changed...
","to 'Clone of the Empire Strikes Back'.This film had potential, and now I know why--it so closely mirrors my favorite Star Wars film 'The Empire Strikes Back' in so many ways: 1. Both Anakin and Obi Wan separate after the opening sequence, much like when Luke visits Yoda while Han Solo and the others escape on the Millennium Falcon.2. There's a love story in both films.3. There's a chase through an asteroid field.4. Count Dooku attempts to get Obi Wan to join him, much as Darth Vader attempts to get Luke to join the Dark Side.5. Obi Wan is imprisoned, albeit briefly, in a forcefield, similar to Han Solo's imprisonment in carbonite.6. Anakin loses his hand in the fight with Dooku just as Luke lost his with Vader.7. C3PO is dismembered in both films.I'm sure there are more parallels, and this is no coincidence. Lucas tried to recreate the best 'Star Wars' film made but he had lost his touch eons ago. I can't put my finger on why the 'Clone' trio of Obi Wan, Anakin and Padme don't match up to Luke, Han Solo and Leia. Either the script was bad, the acting was bad or both (I have to excuse Ewan McGregor since he's a good actor). The love story was lame and so was the humor with the exception of C3PO.The special effects were great but like many films these days, the effects were more interesting than the script. Contrast this to the earlier SW films, in which the plots were more interesting (and funnier) than the effects.Lucas should have outsourced his script.",6,0,2,24 November 2008
American Beauty," Hollywood's contemptuous view of 'Flyover Country'
","THIS won Best Picture?!!! THIS film is in the top 250 films on IMDb?!! Has everyone gone insane? I saw it for the first time on cable last night and was thoroughly unimpressed. This film was predictable and boring. Yes, predictable. Anyone who follows politics or popular culture these days can predict how a film character will be portrayed by politically-correct writers, and this film is no exception.Of course, you can see the upside-down world view of Hollywood depicted here: the most notable to me--since I served with the Marines--was the cartoonish depiction of the retired Marine colonel. He keeps a tight reign on his family, orders pop urine tests, and collects Nazi china. Get the joke folks--the military guy sympathizes with Nazis. (insert laugh track) His wife is a non-entity--a statue. Then naturally the kicker----that he's also a closeted homosexual. The depravity shown is not in the brave men who served for this nation, but of the twisted writer who wrote this rubbish.And of course, the most normal and happy people on the block were--you guessed it---the homosexual couple. Yay!!! You too could be happy if you were gay!!! What a bloody joke!I did say above that the script was predictable, and I was right. I just read that the 'writer' of this film is 'outspokenly gay'. Yeahhhh, I think I figured that one out on my own.As a side note, I heard some yahoo say that she only went to this film because there was a girl lying on a bed of roses and apparently was expecting something different. Uhh huh---this is the same type of mouth-breather who voted this in the top 33.Thank God I never paid to see this propaganda.",1,19,43,22 October 2006
The Exorcist," Still a classic film
","This is not a slasher pic. This is a serious drama--so much so that it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. What really makes this film still chilling is the fact that there's a serious subplot about the priest (well-played by Jason Miller) doubting his faith and guilt-ridden about his mother's declining health. I suppose what I like best about this film is the positive portrayal of the priests--a practice long since eschewed in modern day, Marxist Hollywood that is hostile to Christianity (see 'Priest', 'Dogma', and most recently Larry David urinating on a painting of Jesus).Another reason why this film works so well is that there are serious actors in this film: Cobb, Miller, Burnstyn, Von Sydow, not 20-something females with scanty clothing screaming constantly.I just watched it for Halloween, and still find parts difficult to watch. This is not a slasher film. It's still a great film and holds up today, in my opinion.",10,0,2,1 November 2002
American History X," Powerful film
","This is a very effective movie, which for me is gauged by how many times my stomach turned during this film. Edward Norton gives the performance of a lifetime, and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.The topic of race relations in America is a touchy subject, and this film thankfully didn't portray one side--i.e. the whites--as being the problem. There are many black 'leaders' who fallaciously allege that blacks cannot be racist because they haven't any power. This allegation is ridiculous: the fact that Tawana Brawley was never prosecuted for her fiasco is an excellent example of which side has the power. The worst thing that you can be labeled these days? A Communist--no. A Fascist--no. The worst thing you can be labeled these days is a 'racist.' That's why many whites are reluctant to speak on race relations, it's the 3rd rail of politics.No one probably wants to admit it, but Norton's character makes a lot of sense when discussing the illegal immigration problem and the Rodney King debacle. I had heard a stat from the FBI not too long ago that was eye-opening: that black men, who are 6% of the American population, commit 45% of the violent crimes in this country--that's unbelievable!! Further, you have people that practically swim to this country from Asia, learn the language, and still outperform blacks in school, and yet all we hear are excuses from the black 'leaders.' The vision of a Southern governor of the 50's standing outside a school to prevent black children from entering is a distant memory. Now you have schools practically begging black students to apply to college, despite their poor qualifications, in order to promote 'diversity' while Asian kids, for example, work their butts off and get cheated as colleges admit the less qualified applicants. So much for fairness and the American dream. And yet, these policies by liberal do-gooders promote more friction among ethnic groups. Unfortunately, however, a white man like myself is not supposed to brooch these issues--for only someone like Bill Cosby can, and he has, to his credit. Despite my rants above, I don't believe in the radicalism of these white supremacist groups. This nation would undoubtedly be more harmonious if there were no more 'protected minorities' and that all quota systems would cease. People should advance based on merit, not by skin color. After all, isn't that what Martin Luther King Jr said?",8,1,3,28 July 2007
Quantum of Solace," I walked out
","I was initially wary about Daniel Craig as Bond, but after having seen 'Casino Royale', I was immediately convinced that he was outstanding in the role, and couldn't wait for this film to be released. I can count on probably 2 fingers the number of times I walked out on a film. This was an extreme disappointment following such a sublime achievement in 'Casino Royale.' I know many people have compared this to the 'Bourne' films--none of which I have seen incidentally. I just cannot see the very liberal Matt Damon as a kick-ass super-spy.From what I understand about the 'Bourne' films, the action is quick and heart-pounding. You can see they attempted to mimic the same type of action, and they succeeded. However I couldn't tell what the hell was going on in this film! The action was so quick and the close-ups so tight that they action was completely lost and impossible to follow. I'm not sure but I think the villain was global warming or something like that...I have read some reviews prior to seeing this and was surprised that the producers didn't capitalize on the roaring success of CR. The opening song was horrendous. The producers jettisoned all the things we love about Bond films: the gun-barrel sequence, Bond asking for a martini 'shaken but not stirred', Q, Moneypenny and even a memorable song (I understand full well that neither Q or Moneypenny was in the last film).I note in closing that I had an appointment which hastened my exit from this insufferable film. I am certain that the producers will awake from this Bourne-induced nightmare and return Bond to some semblance of what he once was.",3,5,8,20 November 2008
Batman Begins," Awesome!
","I love films and because I do I rarely go to the theaters, since most modern films are consistently disappointing or are laden with heavily political (read: leftist) views in order to influence political neophytes. But I digress...I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this film. It is a vast improvement over Tim Burton's 'Batman,' and don't even get me started on his sequel 'Batman Returns.' The director, Christopher Nolan, actually tells a story so well that you believe that it is plausible that a character such as Batman can exist. The script is very strong.Christian Bale is undoubtedly the best Batman yet and the supporting cast--mostly Brits thank God--are equally outstanding. Even Katie the Stepford Wife was tolerable. I also have to commend the young actor who played Bruce Wayne as a child. He was outstanding. If George Lucas picked this kid, 'The Phantom Menace' would have been a lot more watchable.While I loved Danny Elfman's Wagnerian score from 'Batman,' the string-based score in this film is even better.This is one of the best films of 2005 and gets better with repeated viewings. Outstanding job by all!!",10,1,4,13 June 2006
The Longest Day," Inspired Epic
","My original review was written in 2003. I feel I should expand it to at least 10 lines since the first one was so brief and especially since this is Veteran's Day.I am a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces but I naturally I never encountered anything like the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944. When I was growing up in the 70's, calendars still had little icons denoting D-Day, VE-Day, and VJ-Day. Apparently, that's too politically incorrect for today's youths, since they are too busy being indoctrinated in school. But I digress...The scope and breath of this film is amazing. The fact that the film stays together after so much detail is amazing in itself. I read many of the user comments and tend to agree that a lot of the dialogue is stilted, especially in the American scenes. The best part of the film for me was the scenes involving the Germans. Their acting was years ahead of its time. I love the scenes where the German officers are afraid to wake Hitler to tell him about the invasion. The only French scene I can stomach is at the beginning when Irina Demick is on the bike trying to distract the Germans from the adjacent wagon of hay, in where her comrades were hidden. Holy crap she was hot!I thought the best American performances were from Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer and Henry Fonda, whose role was unfortunately too brief. The best British performance was from Richard Burton. His scene at the end is great.Although nothing can match the Normandy landing in 'Saving Private Ryan', I'd take this version of D-Day anyday. While people have commented about the armchair warhawks like John Wayne, I similarly find the inclusion of Matt Damon and other Hollywood lefties in SPR just as revolting.",9,1,4,15 November 2003
The Dark Knight," Its Predecessor was better
","I know this is almost heresy to the legions of people who have fawned over TDK, but this film was far from perfect. To begin with, while I didn't mind the violence, I shudder when I think that my friend took his 2 pre-teens to this film and the violent scenes those kids were exposed to. The violence isn't the comic book kind, and in my opinion it's much too graphic for kids. Once again Hollywood succeeds in desensitizing our youth and robbing them of their childhoods.That being said, Heath Ledger's Joker has to be the best villain ever. He is an urban terrorist--and proud of it! Ledger's Joker commands the screen in every scene he's in. He would be very worthy of an Oscar win.I've been a fan of Christian Bale since 'Empire of the Sun' and 'Henry V' and he's undoubtedly the best Batman/Bruce Wayne. However I thought it was just my sometimes poor hearing that I couldn't decipher what Batman was saying sometimes, due to Bale's growling voice. I had read recently that others felt the same, so I know it wasn't just me. Bale sounded like Bob Dylan in a cowl. The supporting cast is excellent as well: Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman (btw where exactly was Anthony Michael Hall?). Everyone was praising Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance, but I think Katie Holmes did a very good job in BB, even though I'm no fan of hers or her husband for that matter.The plot however, is another thing. One of the opening scenes with the Scarecrow was somewhat confusing, but the 'best' was yet to come. The climax about civilians and prisoners on separate ferries, while Batman attempted to locate the Joker using cellphone sonar--was a confusing hodgepodge of special effects that nearly gave me a seizure! In fact, while there are some artful scenes in this film--the 'break-in' in Hong Kong and the police procession--the story is muddled and I have to see it again to figure out the money laundering plot etc. 'Batman Begins' had a much more coherent narrative and frankly I think it was the better film. I know many have commented on the running time. However, if a film is truly well-done (i.e Braveheart, The Godfather films), the length of the film is an afterthought. In fact, a great film leaves you wanting more, and this film wasn't one of them.This film tried for the home run but it really turned out to be a ground-rule double. Make no mistake, I couldn't wait to see this film. Unfortunately, of the summer comic book films, 'Iron Man' was much better. While this film will far exceed the box office take of 'Batman Begins,' the important thing is that there is not necessarily a positive correlation between how much a film makes and its quality.",8,1,3,20 July 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Embarrassingly bad in some respects
","The flaws in this picture are well-known but I'll start with some other noticeable, less mentioned incongruities: why does Talia Shire's character Connie all of a sudden has a heavy Brooklyn accent in contrast to the first 2 films? Her accent sounded terribly out of place and was a distraction. Coppola should have corrected this. Also, I noticed a lot of double-breasted suits and longish hair on some male characters. I don't remember this style as being popular in the late 70's---more like the time around when the film was made. One more: the gratuitously violent 'hit' scene in Atlantic City. That was something more akin to an B-movie action director rather than a great auteur like Coppola who I consider to be a modern-day Orson Welles in many respects. Coppola's body of work (i.e. 'Tucker' and 'The Cotton Club') will one day be appreciated just like Welles' work is finally getting its recognition. Unfortunately the appreciation usually happens when you're dead. Another misstep, in my opinion, were the constant flashback scenes from the previous films. I mean--everyone knows these by heart by now. There was no need to show these flashbacks--unless they were meant as filler.Now for the major mistakes: Robert Duvall's absence hurt badly. Duvall allegedly told Coppola: 'Let's be honest, this is not about art. It's about money,' which was obviously true. Why didn't they just pay Duvall the money? Because of Duvall's absence, the script was overhauled. I am curious what the film would have been like had Duvall accepted. Despite his absence, George Hamilton did a very nice job as the Corleone's WASP lawyer (an interesting side note: maybe Coppola thought that the final product would be better since Robert Castellano was supposed to be in Part II, but asked for too much money and was written out of the script. A fascinating tidbit was that Castellano was the highest paid actor in 'The Godfather').My apologies to Coppola about the flack he tolerated about his daughter's inclusion in this film and her 'performance.' But let's be real, Andy Garcia falling for her? And speaking of bad acting, Eli Wallach should be tried in court for the most egregious crime of overacting. I think the long layoff after Godfather Part II made Coppola's casting skills atrophy a bit, not unlike George Lucas's casting mistakes a few years later in the Star Wars prequels.Even more painful than Soffia's addition was the lousy dialogue, especially between Michael and Kay. Every attempt was made to 'hit the home run' and give her the one-line zingers that were quite frankly painfully embarrassing to watch.I think it's a shame because the nucleus of the film--about corruption in the Vatican and the possible murder of a pope was very intriguing and done properly, this could have been a great film. Unfortunately it could only be called fair at best.",4,29,46,8 May 2006
American Gangster," Ridley Scott's Epic
","Ridley Scott is one of the finest directors and why the Academy Awards keeps snubbing him is beyond me.This is truly an epic film, depicting the gritty New York/New Jersey drug scene in the 1970's. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington are the main protagonists and both are sublime as usual. To me, the real badass of the film is Josh Brolin. He steals every scene as Detective Trupo of the Special Investigations Unit. Such corruption was commonplace in the 1960's and 70's, which resulted in Frank Serpico exposing the widespread practice of cops 'on the take.' Crowe is excellent as the honest cop searching for a decent team of crusaders to solve the puzzle of the distributor of Blue Magic.The attention to detail in recreating 1970's New York is outstanding. The whole picture has a 'French Connection' feel.The supporting cast is great too: Cuba Gooding Jr., Armand Assante et al.This is a really great film. However, as I commented on the message board, the one thing that disturbed me was the fawning over the real Frank Lucas on the extras DVD. This is a man who killed people directly or indirectly and people were all too willing to 'kiss his ring' when he was on the set. Is there any decency at all anymore?",10,2,4,15 April 2012
Prometheus," Another Scott Masterpiece
","I remember going to the theaters to see 'Alien' when I was a kid. I was scared witless at this xenomorph from another planet.Thirty-three years later, Sir Ridley Scott has created another fascinating world in his prequel 'Prometheus'. I have read many hateful messages and reviews directed at this film because 'it doesn't answer questions'. Why can't people just enjoy this film on its own merits, of which there are many? The cast is stellar. I frankly never heard of Noomi Rapace before this film, but her performance was spot on. Michael Fassbender steals the show as the android David. I can't believe this is the same actor who was in 'Inglorious Basterds'. David knows all about his shipmates for while they were all in cryosleep during the arduous voyage, he was watching their dreams. He is especially infatuated with Dr. Shaw's (Rapace) dreams and with her unshakable belief in God. Later in the film he cons her into taking off the cross. Does David have religious prejudices too? Is he able to be insulted as when Logan Marshall-Green calls him 'boy'? David exacts revenge later in the film on Green, but was it David's idea or someone else's? Without going into too much detail, the part that will have everyone on the edge of his seat is the machine performed emergency operation on Dr. Shaw. This is one of the most squirm-inducing scenes I have ever seen in recent years.The rest of the cast are wonderful: Idris Elba, Guy Pearce and Charlize Theron. Theron does a great job as the leader of the expedition. She slinks around the ship in such an eerie way you might think she was another android.This is the most visually stunning film in recent memory, especially in HD. This reminds me of the original 'Star Wars' in that the special effects were used to underscore the action, not replace the actors with a bunch of CGI which is what happened in the 'Star Wars' prequels. I think this is one of the best science fiction films of all time, right up there with '2001', 'Star Wars' and 'Alien'. Another great job from Sir Ridley Scott!",10,16,26,21 June 2014
Shrek," An Oustanding Film for All Ages
","This film reminds me of the classic Bugs Bunny films that were made in the 50's and 60's: they were hilarious for both kids and adults. It must be difficult to make such a film to satisfy both demographics, but 'Shrek' succeeds in leaps and bounds.This film, unlike the one that followed, has fairly clean humor that both kids and adults will appreciate. The sequel made a reference to the Pinnochio character wearing women's underwear. I cannot see how that is funny, maybe it was inserted for the West Hollywood audience. The older, better comedians like Jackie Gleason used to say if you have to resort to blue humor, then you aren't funny. I think the writers resorted to these desperate tactics on the sequel because it just wasn't nearly as funny as the original (but yet it made more money, go figure).I think Eddie Murphy's performance made the difference of the film. His lines and his delivery were classic ('You have to warn me before you crack one off like that. I had my mouth open too'). Mike Myers was excellent too. John Lithgow's Prince Farquaad was outstanding as the diminutive, egomaniacal prince.The film was supported by the straightforward plot and the excellent musical selections, the latter which included some fairly obscure tunes that fit in so well with the storyline. The love story is sweet and simple, easy for kids to understand that physical appearances are less important than character, yet still touching for adults.Sometimes, the most subtle jokes are the funniest: as Prince Farquaad approaches the torture room, his tiny status is made apparent; when Folonius breaks the small mirror to threaten the magic mirror; the parody of Disneyland; and when Fiona pushed the wedding cake figurine of Farquaad down to its appropriate height. I also loved the 'Dating Game' parody, a joke which was probably lost on people born after 1980. This is a classic enduring film and is definitely on my top 50 films of all time.",10,0,1,15 November 2008
Casino Royale," Boy was I wrong!
","Around the time when there was talk about canning Pierce Brosnan, I did something a bit uncharacteristic: I wrote to MGM, stating that Brosnan was the best Bond in years and it was a mistake to let him go after only 4 films.To see Brosnan play Bond for the first time after having seen him play the role 4 times previously would have required a great suspension of disbelief. He would have looked older, but that usually doesn't stop today's filmmakers (i.e. the upcoming Indiana Jones film). On the other hand, although Brosnan was a good Bond, his films overall were a little over the top. Frankly, of his 4 films, I think I actually sat through 2 of them. I thought 'Goldeneye' was terribly overrated. The usual sex jokes were tiresome. Speaking of tiresome, I just couldn't see Halle Berry as a superspy in 'Die Another Day.' Granted she is nice to look at, but a spy---uhhh no. And the gadgets were getting unrealistic---I mean, an invisible car?! Also the product placements were getting ridiculous---James Bond driving a BMW?? I'm not even a Brit and I was insulted. Bond belongs in an Aston Martin, period. This film was a very pleasant surprise. It returned to the basics. I was initially and prematurely disappointed after not seeing the 'gun barrel sequence' immediately, but was ecstatic after it was slipped in at the end of the opening scene. Craig was impressive in all respects--his physicality, acting, and stunts. I remember reading during the filming that he broke a rib--it's no wonder why! There was incredible action throughout; the opening chase scene was brilliant.The Bond girls were all hot!--especially LeChiffre's gal. The opening song was good and the meaning of the title was suddenly apparent after the final scene. Also, I can never tire of hearing Monty Norman's 'James Bond Theme'. It should be played in every JB film unadulterated---that is, not trying to make it more hip-hop etc. It's awesome as it is after all these years. I have been a huge Bond fan for years and am looking forward to the next flick with Daniel Craig. This is the best Bond film/Bond song since 'The Spy Who Loved Me' in my opinion.BTW, for those of you who didn't notice, Craig played the evil priest dispatched to kill Elizabeth (Cate Blanchette) in the outstanding film of the same name.",10,1,5,25 April 2007
Casino," Disliked it more and more since it was first released
","I saw this when it was first released and it has not exactly grown on me. Scorsese peaked with 'Goodfellas' and tried to re-create that magic with the same screenwriter, Nicholas Pileggi. He cast his usual trusty team of DeNiro and Pesce and Sharon Stone to play Ginger. The best of these was Stone, who reminded me of a lot of fake, greedy women I met in Las Vegas. DeNiro's character was just not likeable or sympathetic to me. Pesce was over-the-top psychopathic and his attempt at a Chicago accent was probably accurate, but annoying and distracting. James Woods was great as the slimeball Lester.
I thought the affair between Stone and the much shorter Pesce was comical.
The violence was too much, causing my date to shudder. Did we really need to see one of the gangsters spitting on the hero? Do we need to give the weak minded more examples of depravity?",3,1,9,15 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," When Lucas was still a visionary...
","I am always amazed at the creativity of artists. When Lucas first proposed 'Star Wars' the board at 20th Century Fox probably thought he was mad, especially since special effects were primitive at best. Who could have envisioned what he had in mind when he first made the original? Who could have imagined what a light saber was? As many have stated, this is much better than the original, and I wholeheartedly agree. After watching a film so many times, people become immune to the amazing innovations shown. A good example is 'Citizen Kane' which included memorable imagery including 'deep focus', low angle shots that showed ceilings, overlapping dialogue, and camera trickery. Many people see 'Kane' for the first time and proclaim 'Big deal!' In 'The Empire Strikes Back,' some of original innovations are the Imperial Walkers, the ice planet of Hoth and the Zen-like Yoda who philosophizes with phrases like 'Try not. Do. Or Do not. There is no try.' I won't re-hash the plot since everyone knows it by now, so I will review the intricacies that make this film work so well. I think the humor in this film works tremendously: for one, the interplay between Han Solo and C3PO cracks me up ('Sir if I may venture an opinion--' 'I'm not really interested in your opinions 3PO.'). Another thing that works is another character not listed in the credits--the Millennium Falcon. The lovable 'piece of junk' that is forever under repair but always comes through in the clutch, like when Han et al were trying to escape from Hoth. There was a pretty tense moment when the Falcon wouldn't start while the Empire's stormtroopers entered the docking bay ('Would it help if I got out and pushed?' 'It might!'). And yet, the Falcon came through as always when the laser machine gun appeared. Further, the non-functioning light speed on the Falcon is a great sub-plot of the film.Darth Vader is at his very best (or worst?) in the way he kills off his own men who fail him. The scene when he kills off Admiral Ozzle is priceless not only for Vader's vengeance but for Admiral Piett's trying not to look at his dead former commander on the deck. Another great scene is Vader killing off Captain Needa ('Apology accepted Captain Needa.') I will even overlook the 'borrowing' from 'Casablanca': in that film, the Nazis first won't let Victor Lazlow leave Casablanca and then change their minds when they won't let him stay. In this film, Princess Leia was supposed to stay and then Vader 'altered' the plans.Some of the greatest films are great in part to the score. How John Williams didn't win an Oscar is another infamous slight by the Academy (He did win a BAFTA). The 'Imperial March' is such a sublime acievement, perfectly fitting for Darth Vader's gang.Lucas ventured into dangerous territory in trying to make a film better than the original 'Star Wars', but he succeeded. Unfortunately, his luck ran out 22 years after the original 'Star Wars' was released when he tried to recapture the glory--and money--when he made the infamous prequels. His casting choices that were so inspired in the original trilogy became so insipid 22 years later.",10,0,1,15 March 2009
Alien: Covenant," Another home run for Sir Ridley Scott
","I had the pleasure of seeing the original 'Alien' in the theater in 1979 and thoroughly enjoyed 'Prometheus'. Unfortunately, the latter received a lot of unjust flak in the media. Michael Fassbender stole the show in Prometheus and does it again in 'Alien: Covenant' as Walter/David. This is much more suspenseful that 'Prometheus' and Scott builds the tension appropriately. Any film made by Sir Ridley and which stars Michael Fassbender can't miss. Just one more thing, Tennessee is a terrible pilot. The ending is awesome. Don't miss this film.",9,0,2,10 January 2018
