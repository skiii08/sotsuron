Ford v Ferrari," Awesome movie... Must see, best movie of the year....especially in 4Dx!
","As an ex NASCAR driver, I was excited to see this movie, and it didn't disappoint at all!
Truly well done movie, really drew you in and made you feel like part of the story, and Christian Bale's performance was perfect for the part, and really I couldn't think of a better actor for the part...
This movie made me want to race again...!
This is a must see movie...the best of the year in my opinion!",10,3,6,18 November 2019
1917," Decent film, great authentic scenery, good acting, but drawn out...
","I liked the soundtrack and great authentic scenery, and good acting, but long and drawn out, and less fighting than expected for a war film... Worth seeing...",7,0,1,11 January 2020
Joker," Great acting by Phoenix, but 2 major movie flaws...
","Was a fairly good movie, basically an introduction to the Joker character from his beginning, and Phoenix did some great acting.
I especially liked his dancing, was very funny and well done. Character development of the Joker was well done and explained.
The movie had 2 major flaws though...
First, the story was based initially about joker killing 3 guys with a 6 bullet 38 caliber revolver. First guy he shot one time, the second guy he shot twice, the third guy he shot once in the leg and then followed him out from the Train and shot him once in the back and then three times in the back after that. I can't believe that the producers and directors and actors could do such a poor job to not realize that you can't shoot 8 shots from a 6 shot revolver! WTF??? Seriously?
The second major flaw with this movie is that at the end, Bruce Wayne's father is shot and killed by a fake Joker! Why the hell would they have that happen, when everyone knows that from the beginning of the Batman Story the way it was always told, it was the real Joker that killed him!?! So that was a real letdown, to have the story changed for no good reason. Finally, there was no after movie credit scenes, which was a little bit disappointing, but not the end of the world.
Overall, Phoenix carried the movie, and did a fine job doing so, and I enjoyed the movie, although it could have used some nudity to complete the story. Phoenix will never be as good as Heath Ledger, he was a legend and the absolute perfect Joker, but unfortunately he overdosed and took himself away from us, and Nicholson had alot more confidence and charisma, but I did thoroughly enjoy the performance by Phoenix and recommend seeing the movie, and I look forward to the continuation of the story in the next film beyond this.",7,1,3,5 October 2019
Midway," Great movie...
","Great movie and acting, only negative was no mention of the atomic bombing afterwards, which would've been nice to see...",9,1,2,23 November 2019
