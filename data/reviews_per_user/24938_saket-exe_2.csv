Requiem for a Dream," Depression Defined
","I don't know what I watched but this is the most depressing movie I have ever watched and its best at being that.
I am writing this review almost after 10 years of watching the movie and still it hasn't left the spot in my head.",9,0,0,2 May 2020
Aquaman," DCEU Lifeline! Visually dazzeling
","Won't be suprised if it gets academy award for visual effects and production design. Dialogues are cringy but the cast has given everything they can to produce a masterpiece. The movie feels like a testerone charged rocket which keeps exploding every few minutes Avatar grade CGI work.
That being said, editing could have been better since this was supposed to be an origins story which are generally all good(insert: wonder woman). Still DCs finest jewel.
And yeah, Amber you beauty. I don't know how many times I will fall in love with you after I saw you in Never back down for the first time.",7,5,9,16 December 2018
