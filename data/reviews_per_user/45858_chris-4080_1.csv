First Man," Way too long and a bit boring
","You'll probably enjoy if soap opera is your thing and less so if you are interested in the Moon landing. It's slow and about twice as long as it need be. Apollo 13 it certainly isn't. Not by a long chalk. My recommendation would be wait for it to be on TV, record and fast forward the boring bits.",5,6,14,12 October 2018
