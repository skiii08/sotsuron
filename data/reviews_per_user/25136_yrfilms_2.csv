Changeling," Another triumph for Eastwood and Jolie!
","Clint Eastwood returns to 'Mystic River' territory in this period piece that digs deeper into LAPD's past in corruption. Anybody who thought that LAPD's bad reputation is recent would be shocked to find that it was as bad in the 1920's. Angelina Jolie delivers a powerful performance as a wronged mother whose son disappears. To add insult to the injury she's further abused by the LAPD who instead of finding her missing son, trying to use her for their benefit. The film has some minor problems with its length and the overbearing score by Eastwood as well but hopefully it will get fixed before its release in the fall.

Match Point," Some new territory for Woody Allen
","This film at first doesn't seem like a typical Woody Allen film but at the end you know it's one and why. While the story and theme is familiar, Mr Allen brings new perspective and avoids clich√©s. He goes to the themes he explored in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' but without the Ingmar Bergman homage. Instead it's more fun and exciting to watch. I guess the young hot cast and new location doesn't seem like the usual Woody Allen film, even though he used young hot talents before. This one belongs to his best films which is good news to his fans. The cast is excellent but the supporting cast outshines the leads somehow. Matthew Goode made a strong impression and sure to become a star in the near future. I'm glad Woody Allen changed locations and used some of the best British actors for a change. I guess people who will read this comment, will already know about the plot, so I will avoid it. I watched the film at Cannes where it was well received by critics and the audience.",8,191,316,7 June 2005
