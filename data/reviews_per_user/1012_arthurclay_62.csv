The Rock," Cage's best action flick
",This one you can watch many times. Connery is great as the old man whose smarter than the young man and Cage supplies the comic relief as the buddy. Ed Harris gives a great performance as the not quite but almost evil general who seizes Alcatraz Island for ransom to receive compensation for deaths of his fellow Marines in black ops missions around the world. There is a crap load of action. This cemented Cage as the actor in demand and lead to several other action movies for him. And Connery never looked better in his old age. This was one you had to see at the theaters if you didn't you missed the boat. I need to get this on DVD and I will when I find the time to do so.,10,1,2,24 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was pretty good
",I am a fan of the originals and I went to see it opening night like everyone else did twenty two years earlier. It was enjoyable to see it continuing for the younger generation and I kept an open mind. I was not disappointed. Lucas did a good job although the Jar-Jar Binks character should not have had as big a part and legions of fans still hate him. Another flaw was that Darth Maul didn't have a big enough part. He could have really been something had his character been given more lines and screen time. Not as big as Vader but still big. Other than those two things I would say it was commendable for not having any of the original cast with the exception of McDermid who is a big plus in my book. A solid actor if there ever was one and a nice guy so I hear.,8,1,3,8 June 2005
The Ring," One kid you didn't want to see get pulled outta the well
","A good adaptation of a Japanese film that had one hell of a killer ending. The Samara villain was pretty damn clever and cool I believe she even won an MTV Award that year. Another memorable trivia piece for this movie was that half the reels sent out to the movie theaters were defective and showed only half of the movie prompting many viewers to get their money back. Unheard of I don't know of that ever having happened before or since. One thing is certain. This made Naomi Watts a star. Maybe not a huge star, but a star. Whether or not she gets any bigger I wouldn't hazard a guess. The special effects are cool and the plot twists are fresh and keep you entertained. Brian Cox unfortunately has a very small part blink three times and you'll miss him completely. It's not a scary as most other well known and popular horror films but it will keep your attention.",10,0,1,19 August 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best action adventure movie of all time
",The movie that defined adventure movies. The one that every action movie aspires to be and never is. Harrison Ford's most spectacular role the role he was made to play. The film you can watch ten million times and it never looses its luster. It is all of these things. After all its the Raiders of The Lost Ark. Spielberg said himself he looks at every movie he has ever made and says there were things he didn't like about them. Things he would change. Not this one. He said it was perfect. And he was right. If you don't own this movie on VHS AND DVD you will melt like a Nazi staring at the Ark of the Covenant. Ford was never better. It was his defining moment. Immortalized forever. If you learn anything from watching this movie it is this: the moral of the story is America rocks and Germany doesn't. Followed by the controversial bloodfest Temple of Doom and the happy-go-lucky The Last Crusade. Six stars out of five. The End.,Null,0,0,18 November 2004
Chinatown," No, it really isn't the best movie ever
","Does that mean it's bad? Certainly not I wouldn't suggest that it's a really good movie, probably even a great movie but certainly not the best. Newsweek named it the most influential movie of the 1970's. They must not have seen the Godfather Parts I or II or a virtual host of other movies (Jaws, Rocky, Patton to name just three) that were more famous and much more noteworthy to the public. True this was one of Nicholson's best and most famous performances (along with The Shining, A Few Good Men, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and the same is true for Faye Dunaway perhaps her most famous role. She was young, beautiful, and talented and I know Ali McGraw couldn't have touched her performance in 2 million years. I have not seen this film for quite some time which explains why I don't believe it was the greatest film of the 1970's if it was I would have watched it more than a couple of times in my entire life. I never had much respect for Polanski's work and it had nothing to do with the accusations he committed a crime. I just didn't connect with any of his characters or his directing. No slam against him but I just didn't. If I remember correctly Detective Jake Gittes in L.A. is hired to investigate charges of adultery against a wealthy, influential man. When he turns up dead Gittes investigates and turns up a nefarious money making scheme involving the deceased's wife and his father-in-law turned business partner. I don't feel I need to throughly explain this movie as I'm sure it's been done a thousand times on this site but I do think people should view it as it is what I consider a classic. It's was just not that memorable to me aside from the ending which was pretty unexpected.",8,0,3,2 June 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Friggin funny!
","I have never been a fan of zombie movies and never will but this was a slam dunk. The first half is straight comedy and great comedy at that with the second half being more horror with some comedy thrown in. Shaun is a guy who works a average job but doesn't have much on the ball and no ambition to speak of (please stop reading if this hits too close to home which it probably does for most of us guys) not to mention the fact that he is dating a pretty girl who is getting way more than just tired of his backsliding and his complete lack of sensitivity and romantic tendencies. All he wants to do is drink at his favorite pub the Winchester and keep his relationship with her on life support which causes her to break up with him. His roommate is a complete a-hole and his best friend is a loser who doesn't have a job, plays video games nonstop and sells weed. He hates his father-in-law and he is sleepwalking through life. Then things start moving when zombies suddenly start appearing and Shaun has to deal with them. He does the best he can but not being up to snuff on zombie killing he has to try a little harder to save his family, friends and even his girlfriend from joining the legions of undead. The whole film is of course an homage and spoof of the Caesar Romero movies that the whole world has come to know and love and I feel it is worthy of just praise. I would like to see a sequel and there may be one with all the favorable publicity and acclaim Shaun of the Dead has received.",10,2,4,13 March 2005
Happy Gilmore," The best Sandler's ever done
","I had to write this review just to say that the fight scene between Happy Gilmore and Bob Barker is the funniest thing you will ever see on a Adam Sandler movie bar none. The kid getting hit with the baseball is also very amusing and Sandler's antics keep the film moving at a steady pace. The real noticeable good acting performance comes from Christopher McDonald the movie would not have worked without him. He supplies both the bad guy role and the darker comedy role to make it plausible for the audience. Probably the best role he ever has done and he is funny just as funny as Sandler. I liked this even more than 'Billy Madison', ten times more than 'Spanglish', and a hundred times more than 'Punch Drunk Love'.",9,1,1,14 June 2005
The Girl Next Door," Enter the Eli Experience!
",The funniest movie of the year. There was tons of great lines and Timothy Olyphant stole every damn scene and was unbelievably hilarious. And where did this kid come from? He's got a future ahead of him if he has an agent who knows what they're doing that's for sure. He is terrific. Elisha Cuthbert is hotter than napalm and funny to boot she can move next door to me any day she wants I'll even help her unpack. The whole plot is wickedly entertaining and his two friends are wildly amusing. I now sincerely regret not going to the theaters to see this it would have been worth every penny. The one movie that looked good this year that I didn't go to see on the big screen and it was the one I got the biggest kick out of. Go figure. And watch the unrated version it's the one you want to see.,Null,0,0,17 September 2004
The Others," Leave us in peace!
","'We must learn to live together . . . the living and the dead.' Certainly one of the most chilling lines you will ever hear. Kidman has done some good movies, some mediocre movies, and even a few what we would call bad movies. This is not one of them. She is terrific. She plays the mother of two terribly sick children living on an island off of England during World War II who has just lost her husband. She hires three strangers who just happen to have worked in her home previously and begins to have strange occurrences happen soon afterward. The movie takes awhile to come full circle but it once it has you in it's grip it won't let you go. It is fiendishly scary and the buildup to the finale is filled with tension and suspense. Another great twist ending and a real barn burner at that. Don't miss this one.",10,0,3,14 June 2005
Troy," A solid movie
","Not completely historically accurate and it took some liberties (Not that I care because I don't) but it was remarkable in many aspects. The cast was more than adequate and the realism was impressive. You feel like you are in the middle of the action and it never lets up. Watch it with surround sound and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I have never been a Brad Pitt fan and probably never will be but I have thought that three of his performances have been noteworthy (Seven, Interview with A Vampire especially) and this is the third. This film needed a big big name to play Achilles, the greatest warrior who ever lived and they found one. You actually like his character and want him to win the battles and get the woman he loves and who loves him more than anything. This is the romance that the viewer really cares about not the silly and ultimately self-destructive one between Bloom and Kruger. The women were also very beautiful and added nicely to the viewing experience. I am also not a big fan of 'star-crossed lover stories' but they did a wonderful job of weaving in the romance with all the action sequences. Bravo Peterson for not trying to give us another friggin Titanic which we didn't want or need. Eric Bana did a fabulous job as Hector he gave the film added credibility and Sean Bean as Ulysses was also a good if unexpected pick. Peter O'Toole as King Priam didn't hurt either and Brian Cox is back in the saddle riding high as the SOB Lord of Men King of Kings Agememnon with some clever dialog and witty banter with Pitt. Almost as good as Gladiator and Braveheart to be sure a great way to spend a Friday night. If the Gods are pleased they will follow up with The Odyssey as a sequel I would love to watch that as well and don't forget to cast Bean again.",10,14,26,1 January 2005
Insomnia," Best cop movie I've seen in the last 12 years
","When you have three Academy Award Winners in one picture, it's destined to be terrific or downright terrible. This movie is terrific. The funny thing is I didn't realize how good it was until about four years later. Time has a way of blurring your memory and mine is more blurred than most. You can't forget this one however because it sticks in your head and won't come out. The cinematography is superb and the lines are, in several places, quite unique and memorable. I will always remember at the end, feeling Dormer's (Pacino) insomnia. Literally feeling it. And obviously, I've been there. I once went eight whole days without a night's sleep. Don't ask me how, but I did. And after that much sleeplessness, it begins to mess with you. I have only seen about ten minutes of the original film on which this film is based, not because I got bored and turned it off, but because I didn't realize what I was watching. If I had, I most certainly would have watched the whole thing. Robin Williams was an illogical but certainly credible, deserved, and welcome addition to this film, and anyone who says he plays something other than what he actually plays didn't pay close attention. He is always good for an unexpected performance. Do yourself a favor, study this film. Really study it. A true work of art if there ever was one on film.",10,7,10,6 October 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Pretty decent horror
",I felt that at times throughout the entire movie that Tim Burton was being his deliberate just plain gross self which does bother me. There was no need to go completely overboard just to impress the younger horror crowd but he did and there you have it. Johnny Depp was good and the rest of the cast was the same. It also does not have much to do with the original story so if you are looking for a carbon copy of the old Disney classic keep looking you won't find it here. Icabod Crane is called upon to investigate a series of deaths in Sleepy Hollow and begins to suspect that the young daughter of Van Tassel is more than involved. The headless horseman is also an obvious suspect as everyone's head keeps getting cut off. A good twist ending is mandatory and is duly delivered. I may watch this one again sometime lord knows when that will be but I won't mind when I do.,7,1,2,30 June 2005
We Were Soldiers," One of the three most bloodiest war movies you will ever see
","The violence in this has to be seen to be believed and believe me it's violent. Bullet riddled, blown up, burned up bodies like mad. It is right up there with Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. The acting was fine with me I did not have a problem with that or anything about it for that matter. It was based on a book of the first account of U.S. troops fighting in Vietnam and I have to think it's pretty realistic. They were trained, schooled, properly equipped, and completely unprepared for what was about to happen to them. Lambs to the slaughter in every sense of the word. You watch this and it makes sense why America lost the war.",8,2,4,14 June 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Starts off OK gets worse from there
",The only good thing I have to say about this film was that they got the original cast members back. It begins with Vincent rounding them all up and telling them they owe him 150 million dollars and that he's ticked off and he's gonna kill them all if they don't pay him back. Good premise I like that. There are some funny parts in the first few minutes or so but mostly it's Clooney acting like he knows what he is doing but unfortunately he doesn't. There is no script apparently and the acting is atrocious. I guess they think since they are some of the most well known actors in Hollywood they don't have to work at it anymore they can just show up put in the hours and go home. Wrong. Come on Pitt I know you can do better than that. Putting on a 3000 dollar suit and 600 dollar shoes isn't acting it's fashion modeling. I can do that and so can most other physically fit people. The lack of a good crime scene ending bothers me. The presence of Julia Roberts bothers me. And yes Matt Damon saying Julia Roberts looks like Julia Roberts over and over forty different times bothers me! They had a lot to work with and they did nothing with it I'm glad I didn't buy or rent it.,4,0,0,14 June 2005
Snatch," Funny as Hell and a great crime caper
","I really enjoyed this one. Dennis Farina and Brad Pitt along with Alan Ford, Vinnie Jones, and Jason Stratham tear you a new one. A very large diamond is stolen from a bunch of Jewish jewelers in London by a group of Mafia gangsters and changes hands many, many, many times while at the same time two racketeers try and make peace with a boxing promoter/crime boss. It's witty, clever, and throughly enjoyable. I liked the way it flowed from story to story and Pitt is amusing as the fast talking kick your ass Gypsy. Dennis Farina is terrific and the scene with his brother thinking he is a Jew when he is of course Italian is hilarious. Alan Ford is the standout here giving a excellent speech about feeding his enemies to pigs. There is a little bit of action and shooting to offset the comedy which prevails throughout the entire picture. The acting is well done and fits nicely with the plot. Guy Ritchie has shown us that he has some good material up his sleeve and I hope to see a lot more.",10,0,1,7 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Movie that nobody wanted to see end
","But I guess it had to. That final scene between Vader and Luke is the most touching scene ever and the saddest for me it's worse than seeing Old Yeller get shot or watching Bambi's Mom buy the farm when I was a youngster. I guess the point was that no matter how evil or unscrupulous a person is they can always be saved if not in this world then the next. The Emperor is so unfathomably twisted it's sick he's worse than the Wicked Witch of the West, the Evil Stepmother, and that kid from the Omen all rolled into one. But damn he's so cool. I guess that's why he's in every Star Wars movie except 'A New Hope'. Lucas probably had a field day dreaming him up. I still can't understand why he didn't make the top ten villain list he deserves a spot no doubt about it in my mind. Maybe since the last three they will realize they have made a mistake and put him in. He's a really good actor probably the most talented of the bunch. I will finish my comments by saying 'And now ... my young Jedi, YOU WILL DIE!'",10,1,2,8 June 2005
Closer," So bad it bothered me for three days
","Where do I begin? I know. This movie was complete garbage. The acting was mediocre at best, the script appeared to have been written by a 15 year old high school dropout, the movie had no point and worst of all their was no ending. No really there was literally NO ENDING. Someone once said, 'A man without a plan is not a man.' This translates to film making as 'A film without a point is not a film.' That pretty much covers the point that I am so explicitly making. The four characters are supposed to be in love with each other. The writer tries to pound this point home but he forgets one thing. None of the characters have the slightest idea what love is and it is painfully obvious to even the most dimwitted individual. Telling someone 'I love you' doesn't prove to the audience that they actually feel that way. Yet Jude Law's character tells Julia Robert's character this the first time they meet after 20 minutes together. If you told that to a grown woman the first time you met she would immediately laugh in your face then ask you to leave. I don't care how good looking you are or think you are. I really wonder how this movie got nominated for four Academy Awards but more importantly what possessed these four to sign up for this disastrous bomb? It will not be remembered fondly if remembered at all and a serious film watcher shouldn't watch it once much less twice.",1,3,5,24 December 2005
Taxi Driver," One of the strangest and yet remarkable movies ever
","My brother commented that is was the weirdest movie he'd seen in a while and I have to admit it is definitely odd but strangely entertaining. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam Vet who goes to work as a Taxi Driver in NYC because he has nothing else to do. He comes into contact with some strange people which is OK as he is very strange himself. He meets a beautiful woman (Cybill Shepard) who is working to elect a Senator to the Presidency and he messes it up big time. He meets a extremely young girl (Jodie Foster) who works as a prostitute and works to save her from her predicament. You as the viewer watch Bickle lose himself and apparently his sanity minute by minute and somehow he pulls it together and you're simply amazed by the transformation. Scorsese and DeNiro are currently negotiating for a long overdue sequel and I hope they are able to do it. I know many fans have been wanting one for decades.",8,5,10,2 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," My least favorite of the trilogy
","I suppose it is because it gets too bogged down in politics and not enough action. Also Hayden Christensen is not likable. Couldn't they have found a more popular and seasoned actor to play Anakin Skywalker than him? I would like to think so. I know he is supposed to play a spoiled brat of sorts but I wanted to relate to his character one way or another, love or hate not simply indifference. I know he has some big shoes to fill literally so I tried to cut him a little slack but he just doesn't do anything for me I truly wish he did. On the other hand Ewan McGregor is good in his portrayal as Ben Kenobi he has the energy and the ability to make it work. I am not sure if I would watch it again to tell you the truth perhaps someday I will I don't know when that will be though.",7,0,4,8 June 2005
Gone Baby Gone," You won't regret watching this
","The first thing I have to say is the cast rocked. Harris and Freeman were top picks. Casey Affleck manages his part well. Yes, he's not a leading man, but his character didn't need a Russell Crowe type actor to play him. The storyline is good, even if the characters come off a tad cartoonish. The same could have been said for 'Mystic River' if the acting hadn't been so spot on. This film's plot is the reverse of 'Mystic River'. In Mystic River, the victims become the purpetrators. In 'Gone Baby Gone', the purpetrators are ultimately, the victims. These two films share a common theme. There are no good guys. There are no clear cut distinctions between good and evil. Right and wrong become viewpoints rather than right and wrong. And isn't this the 'truth' of life I mean the real truth? The kind of truth they don't teach in schools or churches. Ben Affleck hits paydirt. Maybe his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame will be made after all.",10,1,4,9 November 2007
The Godfather: Part II," Considered by some
","Critics to be better than the original artistically at least. I am still not sure myself but they may be right. It continues the legacy of the Corleone Family and digs into the roots of their criminal empire. There are a series of flashbacks and that could be confusing to some and to be honest I'm not sure that was positive for the flow of the picture but who am I to criticize that. There is more violence here than in the first Godfather and several scenes, like the original, feature real life events. I personally like the first one better probably because of Brando but I will watch both without reservation. Pacino shines here as brightly as in the first one and DeNiro gives it some much needed weight to replace or more accurately continue Brando's character. It is also much sadder than the first in my opinion and shows the misery and depravity of young Vito's life and why he was what he was. It is a true masterpiece.",10,6,9,2 July 2005
Predator," A Great Action/Science Fiction movie
","I've never been so terrified of a 'sci-fi' movie before or since. It borders on horror territory not only because of the gore and violence but the thrills and excitement leading up to each killing and following them. The writing and action sequences are damn good and each scene is packed with intensity and suspense. You wonder every minute, 'Whose gonna get killed, skinned, and ripped apart next?' This may be Arnold's best performance after The Terminator. And the supporting cast was perfect. These guys (and girl) were money. They worked so well together and fit like a glove. Special effects are off the hook. For a 1980's film they were light years ahead of their time. It looks so realistic. And the fighting scenes are too. If you haven't seen this run down to the video store and get it or better yet just buy the new DVD version.",10,1,2,20 August 2005
Léon: The Professional," I thought my hearing's going! I says to myself Leon's a pro!
","Never have I seen a film so well put together. Amazingly enough The Professional was the best work done by these four thespians: Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Danny Aiello AND Gary Oldman. They probably didn't know it at the time it was released and neither did anybody else. Why this movie was denied at the Academy Awards we may never know but it was terrific. The on screen chemistry between Reno and Portman is unforgettable. Their relationship is what makes it work but the real star is Gary Oldman. He is phenomenal repeat phenomenal. His over the top performance is the best of his entire career and earned his character Agent Norman Stansfield the number 6 spot on the Entertainment Weekly's all time greatest villains list.I have read the reviews of the two people in the world who didn't like this film and it doesn't take long to figure out why they didn't like it. The first didn't have a clue about what the movie was really about (readers can draw their own conclusions about that person's mental capacity) and the other somehow arrived at the erroneous conclusion that director Luc Besson is a sellout. I'm not going to bother to respond to that. The acting was top drawer for such a small budgeted film, the dialogue was remarkable and there is enough action to keep you entertained. Best film of 1994 and number 64 on the top 250 movies on IMDb.",Null,6,11,5 September 2004
The Bourne Identity," Action is Bourne!
","This movie has become my favorite spy/assassin movie of all time.  The first time I saw it I thought it was very good but not great.  Wrong.  This movie kicks so much a$$ it's ridiculous.  I think you just have to watch it a few times before it sinks in.  The acting was great, car chases were killer, plenty of shooting to keep you entertained, and a cool storyline to follow and keep you in suspense.  Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, rescued by Greek fishermen 30 miles off the coast of France with two bullets imbedded in his back, he has no memory of his life or what happened to him.  He soon discovers when he reaches land that a secret U.S. government agency called Treadstone knows he is alive and is trying to eliminate him.  He must elude his pursuers across Europe and discover his identity with the help of a woman he hardly knows (Franka Potente) before it is too late and they kill him and her.  Based on the best selling novel by the late Robert Ludlum, I have heard that the writers took some liberties when they created the screenplay but since when is that bad thing when you do a good job.  The casting was excellent and the locations fantastic, one of the higher points often touched upon in other reviews.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are poster boys for bureaucrats gone bad and Julia Stiles does well in her limited role.  Clive Owen is devilish as The Professor one of the hitmen assigned to kill Jason Bourne.  I never would have considered Matt Damon of all people as a legitimate action star but he sure can surprise you time and time again.  He has definitely eclipsed buddy Ben Affleck in terms of box office draw AND acting.  This one put him on the map as a leading man and sensational new star.  Engrossing from start to finish.  Followed by the sequel The Bourne Supremacy.",Null,3,4,16 August 2004
The Killing Fields," Heart wrenching and compelling
","'The Killing Fields' is something I recommend every person watch. The Khmer Rouge were one of the most evil organizations on the face of the Earth and without a doubt committed the worst acts of genocide in my lifetime. Even worse than Bosnia and Rwanda. Original estimates put the death toll at one million, later the number was upgraded to two million. The Khmer Rouge were not sub-human, that implies they had some humanistic qualities. They were in-human. To do those sorts of things you must have no heart, no feelings, and no soul. To them, human life is not cheap. It is worthless. And to allow these vermin to carry out this program of degradation and mass slaughter gives the whole world a black eye, not just America. America was involved in Vietnam, which spilled over into Cambodia. We were 'responsible' for that, although it most likely would have happened anyway. To allow it to continue unabated for the next decade was the real crime. I suppose the real question here is 'Should America be the world's policeman? And if not, who will be?' The easy answer is 'No. The U.N. is the world's policeman.' But the U.N. has proved itself time and time again to be unreliable at best and at worst completely useless. I honestly don't know if the U.S. has the right to interfere in foreign affairs. But if the U.S. doesn't do something, no other country will. And these kind of atrocities will continue in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere until the world ends.",10,4,5,10 April 2008
The Shining," Check In at the Overlook Hotel
","Stanley Kubrick outdid himself when he made The Shining and I thought Full Metal Jacket would be the only one I would remember him for. Jack Nicholson tears you a new one with his character Jack Torrance. Jack is a writer and teacher who gets the posh 'dream job' of running a old and very fancy resort, The Overlook Hotel as its caretaker. Jack is told that the winters there are especially brutal and that him and his family will be shut up there for several months. He is also told the hotel was built on an ancient Indian burial ground (Stephen King's favorite plot element) and that many years ago one of the caretakers went crazy and slaughtered his family. One of those 'Just thought you ought to know' embarrassing moments for the management type things. But Jack is unconcerned. He doesn't drink at all and needs solitude to write his book. They are given the grand tour and meet the head cook who 'establishes a mental rapport' with Jack's young son Danny. He and Danny have a gift where they can hear people talk without them talking and can sense impending danger. The family moves in and so begins the long winter siege. Jack likes the place very much in fact he loves it and he gets the impression that he's been there before. His wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall), who is enthusiastic at first, gets the impression that the hotel is not quite normal and is affecting her son in a bad way. Jack becomes more and more irritated with her attitude and day by day he spirals deeper into madness. Jack is determined to correct Wendy's and Danny's behavior and stay at the Overlook forever. Now young Danny and Wendy must find a way to thwart him and escape with their lives. Watching Nicholson slowly lose his strong mind is a joy to watch. It's as entertaining as it is frightening. Only Jack could make it so believable. And Duvall and the young boy are so good they don't even need to be tailored to fit. Danny Lloyd the kid is damn good I don't know how they made him do it for being so young. This film is the best adaptation of a Stephen King book and of the highest quality of cinema. Another one of the select few horror movies of the past 25 years that holds up to its fame and success.",10,0,2,26 June 2005
Collateral," Not like any other night!
","Fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  Tom Cruise did a superbly great job and Jamie Foxx surprisingly wasn't bad either.  This one has bumped A Few Good Men from my list for #1 favorite Cruise films.  I think he will at least be nominated for Best Actor for Collateral if not win and I would like to see that happen very much.  I was sure that Cruise would put on a show but I wasn't sure that Foxx would but he did.  I didn't have a very high opinion of his ability before I watched this so he scored a few points with me with his performance.  All I can say is THANK GOD they didn't cast Adam Sandler as Max the audience would have gone out and collectively hired a guy like Vincent to take care of him once and for all.  Enough humor but they did not go overboard.  It did take the edge off a little in what Vincent was doing which kept the movie from becoming too dark.  I was a little surprised by the ending but I didn't feel that was bad, maybe not what I would have done, but certainly not bad.  Michael Mann is showing some considerable skill in his directing he's moving up in the world.  And using the digital photography really added to the experience.  Brilliant.  Go see this one. Best film this year.",Null,0,0,27 August 2004
The Exorcist," I need a young priest and an old priest
",'The power of Christ compels you!' 'The power of Christ commands you!' has got to be one of the best film quotes ever and it's pretty damn good if you'll pardon the expression. I don't know how they got the kid to be so damn creepy and sick but the rest is movie history. The words on the front of the box tell you 'THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE' and this was probably true when it came out in 1973 and may still be true today. If I had been say 9 or 10 or even 17 when I first saw it I probably would not have slept for two months as it is pretty shocking and graphic. I know that when people saw the opening day release they left shocked and horrified like in a daze or trance. I also know for a fact that people actually threw up in the theaters which I have never heard happen with any other movie. Max Von Syndow has done many many good film presentations and this may be his most famous. Lee J. Cobb is also well cast and so was the other father even though I have not seen him in anything else to date. I would not watch this one again like I would other horror films such as 'Halloween' as it is not something that entertains or enlightens one but everybody should watch it once in order to say they have.,7,0,2,14 June 2005
Ocean's Eleven," Better than the original was
",The cool ending is a real mind blower and the plot is well put together. Eleven men attempt to rob three casino's in one in what is to be the biggest robbery in history. Clooney is good for a change and Pitt is good too. Andy Garcia plays the rich criminal butt hole role to a tee and he does the best job acting. Julia Roberts says to Billy Ocean 'You are a thief and a liar.' And Ocean says 'I only lied about being a thief.' The most memorable two lines in the movie. Followed by the big budget yet not quite as entertaining 'Oceans Twelve' featuring all of the original cast members. Watch this first or you will be lost my friends.,8,0,0,14 June 2005
Amadeus," The Music and the Madness but was it really Murder? *SPOILERS*
","*SPOILER ALERT* I had never understood why this movie was so coveted until now. I had watched it when I was about 10 years old and at that time it made absolutely no sense at all much as the Godfather was incomprehensible to me. Having watched it again the pieces fall right into place. F. Murray Abrahams is dynamite and just blows you out of the water with his performance and he's not the only one. Tom Hulce is the gasoline that gets the blaze going. The two of them are bigger than the Fourth of July. Before I watched this I knew that Mozart was a genius of music. I didn't realize that he was THE genius of music. There has never been anything like him before or since. He did for music what electricity did for light bulbs. Here are two men that are rivals. Bitter rivals. It is impressed upon you in every scene. Salieri is great, a true living legend. And he hates Mozart, not because he is better than him but because he is a unsophisticated, uncultured, impish childlike boob. He wants him dead. Does everything he can to utterly ruin him and make him fail. But he loves his music and operas completely, unabashedly and without limits. Covets and appreciates his talent like no one ever could and knows without doubt Mozart is the best composer in the world. But he won't let Amadeus succeed. As a result, Mozart sinks deeper and deeper into a pit of alcoholism, sickness and depression. Wife leaves him and he's flat broke. His father's death haunts him like a demon released from purgatory. Salieri hastens if not actually perpetuates his death and what does Mozart tell him on his deathbed? That he thought Salieri didn't like his music and that he respected Salieri more than anyone and begs his forgiveness for being so wrong! That is a biggest slap in the face I've ever seen delivered on screen. It takes the cake for pure cinematic irony. Mozart, in all probability would have died regardless of what happened but Salieri cannot and will not forgive himself for what he has so underhandedly done to Mozart and even more importantly to the world of music. The way this film is told is brilliant and I'm not surprised it won the many coveted awards it did as it certainly deserved them. Best film of 1984.",10,2,5,19 August 2005
K-19: The Widowmaker," Can't say it was the greatest but it was OK
",AMC says this movie was destined for greatness but as they put it 'It slipped under the radar.' Witty and poetic to be sure. Submarine movies in my opinion generally are good ones and this wasn't below par. I probably wouldn't watch it frequently but perhaps if there isn't anything else on I would. The plot is Ford's submarine the K-19 is out during the Cold War patrolling when it has an accident on board involving it's nuclear reactor and the whole crew is in danger of being killed or worse yet captured by the American forces and if they are released they will be sent to a Gulag in Siberia if not outright executed. Ford is pretty good yeah he screws up the accent but who cares so has a lot of other actors big deal. His character is believed to be a royal bastard by the viewer for 3/4 of the movie then does an about face and becomes a selfless hero which comes as quite a shock I was speechless. Good showing by Liam Neeson whose character can't stand Ford but is uncharacteristically loyal as well to him and ends up becoming his biggest supporter in a play that neither character could have anticipated.,7,0,0,14 June 2005
Patton," A great war film
","And the best performance from an Actor in history. George C. Scott is General Patton, the greatest General of World War II and the most controversial. Scott gives the performance of a lifetime if Patton watched this film he couldn't tell the difference himself. Scott portrays him the way he was, not the way he should be or the way we would like him to be. Patton is Patton, tough, resilient, fearless, sarcastic, angry, witty, cultured, charming, bull-headed, uncompromising, temperamental, and more patriotic than Uncle Sam on the 4th of July. The speech at the beginning with him in front of the American flag sets the tone. It's his way or the highway. And Patton is driving. His antics tick off the high command and rankle his subordinates but they all can't argue with his success. Karl Malden is his good friend and at times adversary General Bradley who is as resourceful as Patton is eccentric and they make a great pair. Every time Patton has a victory he screws it up by way of his gargantuan mouth. But he keeps going. When disaster strikes he always manages to pull defeat out of his rear and strike a blow for the 2nd Corps or the 3rd Army or whatever army he's commanding. His soldiers love him, his soldiers hate him, but his soldiers fight for him regardless because they know he's the best. Patton's rise is like Patton's fall, momentous. His last line is the most telling of all. 'They remind us that glory, like everything else, is fleeting.' Glory may be fleeting but this movie won't be. Perhaps the best war movie in history.",10,57,68,4 May 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Best movie of 2004
","When Eastwood directed Unforgiven and took home the directing Oscar, many people, myself included, thought it would be his only moment of glory. Wrong. Predictably enough, those same people thought that after he directed Mystic River. Wrong again. Eastwood slams another one home with Million Dollar Baby, the movie that took home the gold for all those concerned with the picture. Hillary Swank's stock just keeps going up and up she should be listed on NASDAQ. Freeman is stunning as ever with his performance and narration and let's not forget Eastwood. Eastwood hasn't shown that wide a range of acting ever. For the first time in my life I felt truly connected to one of his characters. I have always liked his movies but he really runs the gambit here. It was tailor made just for him. I can't say enough good things about this picture.",10,2,4,7 December 2005
Donnie Brasco," I'd die with you Donnie *spoilers*
","*SPOILER ALERT* Based on the explosive true life story of Special Agent Joseph D. Pistone who lived undercover in the Mafia for six years. Aging and down on his luck mobster Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Al Pacino)takes on Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), an orphaned jewel thief and brings him into his world, teaches him the rules and loves him like his son yet never for a moment suspects the truth. That Donnie is NOT a gangster but an FBI Agent named Joe Pistone whose job is to infiltrate the Bonnano Crime Family and bring it to its knees. But Joe didn't count on becoming real friends with Lefty and becoming part of his world. His undercover work gathers damning evidence against the syndicate however he slowly becomes entangled in their web of betrayal and immersed in their crimes which include drug dealing, hi-jacking and yes murder. When the boss is killed, Donnie comes under the thumb of Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), a charismatic and cold blooded captain who runs his crew with the sole purpose of propelling him to boss status, allowing him to run the family. Joe's wife Maggie (Anne Heche) becomes more and more distant from him as he climbs the ladder of La Cosa Nostra and becomes one of them. When four brutal murders are committed by the Sonny Black faction, Joe realizes that he has to leave the mob before he is killed. But if he does, they will kill Lefty for letting him get close to them. Operation Donnie Brasco resulted in the largest prosecution of a Mafia family in history and a $500,000 open contract on Pistone's life and his family. Hollywood being Hollywood took some liberties with the actual story but it's still a great watch. Top notch performances by Pacino, Depp, Michael Madsen, James Russo, Bruno Kirby, Anne Heche, and Robert Miano. May have been the best performances from Depp and Madsen you are likely to see and one of the top ten ever by Pacino. Best movie of 1997 ***** out of *****.",Null,0,0,8 September 2004
Black Hawk Down," One of Ridley Scott's better pictures *SPOILERS*
","*SPOILERS* And certainly one of the three most bloodiest war pictures I have ever seen the other two being Saving Private Ryan and We Were Soldiers. This is the story of a simple mission gone horribly horribly wrong. It happens because one idiot General (played wonderfully by Sam Shepard) orders a daylight raid in the heart of Mogadishu to capture some top level members of General Mohammad Farrah Aidid's militia. What results is nothing short of a complete disaster that turns into a military fiasco. A Black Hawk helicopter is shot down and the American General, being a true American, shouts 'Leave no man behind!' despite the soon to be obvious fact that those men are already dead. So he needlessly puts more of his men's lives in serious peril resulting in yet another helicopter being shot down and more men being killed. Think he would have learned his lesson the first time? No he sends more soldiers into harm's way to recover those doomed men! By the end of the film the viewer is practically demanding that this U.S. General be shot by firing squad for extreme incompetence. The end result is that 19 U.S. soldiers and 2,000 Somalis are killed in a single day, resulting in the eventual pullout of U.S. troops after they kill Aidid. This film needed to be made to show the world both how horrid war is and the price that has to be paid in order to make the world safe and I commend Scott for having the guts to make it.",10,2,4,20 August 2005
Major League," Funniest baseball movie ever
","And a great comedic lineup. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Wesley Snipes light up the screen with their antics while Bob Uecker brings the wisecracks which I heard were completely ad-libbed. When the owner of the Cleveland Indians dies the new owner his wife, decides to move the team to Miami but first she has to break her lease with the city. So she figures out a way. If the attendance drops low enough for the year she has the right to leave. So she puts together the worst team in the history of Major League Baseball. They absolutely suck. But then they get better and threaten to ruin her well laid plans. The manager and the owner are so damn funny and they have all the good lines. Watching the skipper whiz on Dorn's contract for the first time was priceless. If you haven't seen this one run out and get it I sure did and I don't regret it for a minute.",9,0,1,5 June 2005
National Treasure," Not bad but not very good either
",Cage does a good acting job with what he has to work with and Kruger is OK too but doesn't do a whole lot either. Bean is fine as well but nothing stands out here that is worth mentioning. I was disappointed to tell you the truth I figured it would be better than it was. The plot was fairly well conceived but didn't pay off like it should have I guess it reeked of too much Disney. Bruckheimer films don't impress me that much either as Jerry seems to go for mindless explosions and action with not a lot of substance. Too bad too because it could have been more than just decent. One comment on the boards said this movie was made to make the Da Vinci Code look good. True? It wouldn't surprise me. Not worth watching twice.,6,1,1,1 May 2005
Hoosiers," Best basketball movie ever made
","I have seen it more times than southern people have been UFO's. It's a true story of a basketball coach who led his little high school basketball team to victory against all odds. Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) is a former college basketball coach of the Ithaca Warriors who turns up in French Lick, Indiana to coach their local high school basketball team. He has a checkered past and a history of causing trouble. Right off the bat he gets into it with Barbara Hershey who is a teacher who becomes acting principal when the former one has a heart attack. Hershey doesn't like Dale at first but gradually warms up and becomes his ardent supporter and romantic interest. The townspeople don't like the Coach at all either and try to get him fired to no avail. But Dale has a recipe for success and it shows quickly when his team keeps winning and winning. I must say all the performances are terrific the best being Hackman and Dennis Hopper in his best role as Shooter, an alcoholic dad of one of the players who loves and knows basketball better than anyone and who Hackman recruits as assistant coach. Hopper is pure magic and it's touching to watch him with Hackman as Dale cares about him and won't give up on him. If you haven't ever watched this one do so it's an inspiration.",10,6,6,4 May 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Probably shouldn't have been made
",And the amazing thing about that is that it's better than most of the stuff being made today. I think the reason why it doesn't have the acclaim accorded to the first two is that it was made too late and doesn't have the powerhouse actors the first two did. Notably missing is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall wasn't offered enough money) and Sofia Coppola should not have been cast as she wasn't an actress (Winona Ryder backed out of the project at the last minute). The funny part of trivia about this film was Coppola's visit to Duvall's house in which Duvall thought he was wanting the recipe to his crab cakes not offering him a part in this next film and the fact that Coppola threatened to start the film with Michael's funeral because Pacino wanted so much money. Again real life situations are part of this movie and are obvious to the semi-trained eye. Garcia isn't bad he just isn't enough to make it truly great which in and of itself isn't his fault the movie was just too contemporary for it's own good. The ending goes for a real slam dunk and it achieves it as far as ending the trilogy. The best part is the mob meeting that was good and so was the action following it. You need to watch this for closure and that's about all.,8,1,3,2 July 2005
Mystic River," Best movie of 2003
","Eastwood, like Dirty Harry, is at it again. He keeps blowing moviegoers out of the water with his great films. Mystic River is no exception. Eastwood assembles a cast here that is second-to-none. Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Lawrence Fishburne. It reads like an A-List celebrity event. Three childhood friends come back into contact years later after a horrific event. One of the friend's children has been murdered and the hunt is on for the killer(s). Where the trail leads is startling and exhilarating. The plot starts off fairly simple and yet gets quickly complicated as all the characters come into play. And these characters are anything but simple. Even the bad guys (and there are many) are three dimensional Sean Penn's character being the most glaring example. Of course what people will talk about for years is the ending. What a bombshell. It's the kind of nightmare that happens in real life all too often when people predictably enough, jump to conclusions. This one is a grand slam home run.",10,1,4,7 December 2005
A Beautiful Mind," Cowe does it again
","A stellar performance from a stellar actor. Thought he was a flash in the pan with Gladiator eh? Me too. We were both wrong. He has proved one thing beyond doubt. He can do anything on film and it works. He indeed was robbed of his deserved Oscar and he indeed earned it in A Beautiful Mind. Superior direction from Howard combined with Russell's talent made it an Oscar favorite. The film does leave out several periods in his life story but I found that those additions only would have served to detract from the masterpiece instead of make it smoother or more 'factual'. This is a story about life, love, sickness, and genius. It is also a story of a triumph of the human spirit. The spirit urges us forward when the mind fails and the heart is not willing. It makes you feel things that most people can never hope to understand. Best film of 2001.",10,1,3,2 January 2006
The Departed," Saw it and absolutely loved it
","Will buy it as soon as it hits the shelves at my local video retailer. Now for the movie. It became obvious very quickly why they chose Jack Nicholson (good choice by the way), it was not only because he is a huge name first rate actor (and he is) but because he gave the film the humor and antics that it so desperately needed to break up the drama, tension, and non stop killings. Wise move Mr. Scorsese. I am the first to admit, I am not a DiCaprio fan. But it's the best performance a director has ever gotten out of him thus far. Matt Damon is terrific, Ray Winstone was solid as a rock, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen both good picks, but I have to say I was a little disappointed in Mark Walberg as he struck me as being way too crass and obtuse even for a cop. His character was the only guy I was hoping was gonna get wasted and shoved down a drainpipe far more than Damon's or even Nicholson's character. That having been said, I look for 'The Departed' to rake several nominations, and saints willing, some wins as well come Oscar time. Crime fans and drama lovers, flock to this film. I will most likely see it again before it leaves the big screen.",10,1,3,15 October 2006
Psycho," Hitchcock's most famous film
","Loosely based on the real life serial killer Ed Gein 'Psycho' is considered by many to be the best horror movie ever. Janet Leigh supplies the best death scene ever and Anthony Perkins supplies the most twisted sick crazed character ever. Norman Bates (Perkins) is a simple yet somehow complex man who runs the Bates Motel. When a beautiful young woman ends up at his place of business after stealing from a client and on her way to meet her fiancée to be, he proceeds to give her supper and tell her about 'mother'. A film known for the infamous shower scene and of course the ultimate twist ending. Hitchock even received an angry letter from a woman whose child would no longer take a shower after watching this film. Hitchcock pointedly asked her why she would let such a young child watch his film? A staple of the American horror genre and the top five best horror film winner.",10,4,7,14 June 2005
American Gangster," A Great, Great Gangster Film
","No Oscar nominations for Washington, Crowe, or Scott? Are you fricking kidding me? And I was becoming convinced that the Academy had turned things around with its celebration of Martin Scorsese's The Departed. Washington's performance of Frank Lucas is twice as good as his portrayal of Alonzo in Training Day. What are we getting tired of phenomenal performances? This is Crowe's best work since 'A Beautiful Mind' people. And what about Ridley Scott, he hasn't been right on the money like this since Gladiator. And what does this film get? Two nominations. Not eight, not five, two. This is the film to buy this year, alongside We Own the Night and Gone Baby Gone. I admit, I don't love every single film that Denzel has done but I can't ever question the quality of his performances, even if I didn't like that particular picture. But I loved this one. I loved him, I loved the fact that it was a real story, and I loved how it was told. You can't expect any more from a film than that. As far as I'm concerned, this was the best film of 2008.",10,0,2,13 February 2008
The Mission," Very Good and Extremely Tragic
",What I would call a heart breaker of a movie emotionally. It is no surprise to a lover of history that this sort of thing occurred on a regular basis but to watch it transpire on film is horrifying. Jeremy Irons gives a great performance and ditto for DeNiro. DeNiro is a pirate and killer who by unfortunate circumstances murders his brother and forces himself to atone for it. Irons plays a priest who saves DeNiro and gives him a purpose to his life. Become a priest and follow the order. DeNiro agrees to this and joins his cause. But events beyond both of their control force them to choose a path neither one wants. Their lives and the people in their mission are doomed and the cause is lost. Watching that priest on the cross fall over the waterfall in the beginning is one of the most shocking things you could ever see in a movie it sticks in your mind for years. Good performances by Adian Quinn and Liam Neeson. Must be watched to be experienced a review just won't do it or give it justice.,10,2,4,2 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My favorite of the last three made
","Saw it opening night as to be expected. It had good action, good plot, and a pulse. The beginning was slow and a little stale but it picks up pretty quick. The two best parts of this film were watching the Emperor fight the Jedi with his light saber and watching Anakin fight Kenobi. That was pretty horrid and memorable I'm not sure little kids won't be emotionally scarred from watching that or seeing some other choice parts. The Emperor is the best character gosh darn he's the best thing since central air. If I could choose to be a character in these last three installments he would be the one screw everybody else. That alone was worth the price of two movie tickets. I applaud Lucas for cramming that much storyline into that time frame I still don't know how he managed that. Pretty impressive that was a lot of ground to cover in two and a half hours. I sure hope he decides to do three more and if the money's right (and it will be) he just might decide to do precisely that. But if not I want to tell you Mr. Lucas it has been one hell of a exciting ride. Thank you for the opportunity to ride along.",9,3,6,8 June 2005
1408," A very good adaptation
","The best since 'The Shining'? Just might be. I read that this is the only selection that Stephen King has re-read that scared him. Watching the film, I can see why. It is a horror story that makes your blood run cold. Samuel L. Jackson's part is small but effective. He has that air of respectability and the demeanor of a guy who sits in a large expensively furnished office of a major hotel and perhaps, might have a fondness for sending postcards. Jackson was a nice touch. Cusack's character is believable, likable, and of course, stubborn as a donkey. The third trait gets his rear end into serious trouble. We can all exhibit that sort of mulishness at times and knowing when to listen to someone can be the best way to prevent disaster. If he had this knowledge, there would be no story. And everyone loves a good story. I'm also looking forward to 'The Mist' and 'Pet Sematary'. King's bucks just keep rolling in and I can't say he doesn't earn them.",9,1,2,22 November 2007
Raging Bull," A landmark in 80's films
","I admit I was never all that interesting in seeing this picture as I was not a fan of the Bronx Bull but I knew it was a masterpiece so I gave it a whirl one night. This film is different from most 80's movies in that it is black and white which is certainly remarkable and quite possibly most ingenious. DeNiro is great, Pesci is great and the movie therefore is great. DeNiro got an Oscar and Pesci should have got an Oscar. I would say the most fascinating thing about Jake LaMotta besides the fact he was one of the greatest boxers of all time is that he was friends with and personally knew several members of Nino Gaggi's uncontrollable DeMeo Street Crew of the Gambino Crime Family featured in the best selling book Murder Machine by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain. A great book maybe the best one on Organized Crime ever written. This movie does need to be seen it is powerful.",9,1,1,2 July 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Good performances but one sick movie
","I know a couple who had actually saw the premiere of this film in Hollywood and actually walked out of it when it started and right past Anthony Hopkins! That alone tells you this is one disturbed film. Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal Lecter, a unimaginably smart and insane serial killer who helps Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster won an Oscar) track down another vicious serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The lines are some of the best you will ever hear and the acting is breathtaking. But it is ridiculously vulgar and sadistic. Not for kids under 18 or for the faint of heart or stomach to be more specific. Followed by Hannibal and Red Dragon also starring Hopkins.",5,2,9,5 June 2005
Tombstone," The best western since Silverado
","Everyone knows the story of Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at O.K. Corral. This film covers the events before AND after that event with a beauty and ferocity that is rarely seen in westerns. Kurt Russell does well as Wyatt, Boothe as Curly Bill, Biehn as Johnny Ringo, but the real showman is Val Kilmer as the chronic killer 'Doc' Holliday and turns in the best depiction of the gunslinger since Kirk Douglas. He is astounding. I think it was the best role he ever had and he makes the most of it. Kilmer makes you care about his character like no else can and his chemistry with Russell works like a charm. The casting was very good and the realism is unmatched. The gunfights are entertaining and keep your attention. There is tension and suspense in Tombstone like no other western you can feel it permeating the whole picture. Forget the movie 'Wyatt Earp' with Kevin Costner this one knocks it out of the box rather easily. It's destined for classic status and is re-watchable which is unusual for most films being made today.",10,0,2,1 May 2005
The Sixth Sense," Shyamalan's Best Work
","With the twist ending that shocked the world. Reminiscent of 'Les Diaboliques' in that regard and several others and followed by 'The Others'. This may have been Bruce Willis's finest acting role. I wish he had been nominated for this. At least the kid got nominated even though he didn't win. Willis is Malcolm Crowe, a gifted child psychologist who is shot in his bedroom by a deranged former patient. A few years later he encounters a young kid named Cole, who is experiencing similar symptoms and appears to be harboring a well kept secret that he doesn't wish to share with anyone. But Crowe keeps pushing to discover what is troubling the boy as his marriage gets worse and worse. What could it be? The answer is as frightening as it is uncontrollable. By far the best horror movie of the 90's and one of my top 50 all timers.",10,1,1,14 June 2005
Casino," Brilliant and spectacular
","I've watched Casino more times than I can count and it never gets old.  It's right up there with Goodfellas though with Casino there isn't the same level of irony and humor that you find with Goodfellas but it's entertaining nonetheless.  This is a tale of unchecked greed, out of control egos, excessive behavior, and ultimately self-destruction that occurs as a result of all the money, power, and obsession.  The violence is right on par with Goodfellas maybe even more so and the violence is VERY necessary (including all the head shots) because it is both crucial to the story and faithful to what actually happened in real life.  I love the two old guys in jogging suits running around killing everybody (they were Felix 'Milwaukee Phil' Aldersio and Charles 'Chuckie' Nicoletti who were credited with 36 killings).  This was a tremendous performance for Sharon Stone and I'm sure it was the best of her career.  She makes you loathe her, despise her, and hate her but she somehow manages to  make you feel sorry for her by the end. DeNiro is dead on as usual and Pesci puts on a show that almost rivals Tommy DeVito.  Casino may not have been as popular as Goodfellas but I believe the acting was just as good and the story was just as gripping. Scorsese must have been proud of himself and this was my favorite movie of 1995.",Null,1,1,29 June 2004
Heat," If you can't stand the Heat
","Then you're crazy. I guarantee you in the last part of the movie (you will know which part when you watch it) will have you yelling at the screen 'No, no, no, no what the HELL are you doing?!?! WTF! WTF!' I enjoyed every minute but two things that DeNiro's character does at the end are inexplicably out of character for his character and there is no denying it. This guy is a master thief and killer he wouldn't have done what he did under any circumstances he was far too clever and the movie went to great lengths to point that out to its audience. If you are an avid movie watcher you will know immediately what I'm talking about. One of the things this movie does well like Collateral and The Professional is bring out the humanity in the characters both good sides and bad sides at the same time. You emphasize for Neil just as you don't feel anything for Vincent and want him to lose. The cast of this movie will blow your mind there are more big name actors here than Planet Hollywood ever had walk through its doors. They do an astoundingly good job. I was teed off at both of the main women characters throughout the whole damn show til right at the close because one was a insufferable pathetic nag and other was a self-centered greedy bitch and that is what they were supposed to be so they did just fine. And the shootout is tremendous it's like Vietnam in downtown Los Angeles. I'm not gonna throw any spoilers out but all I can tell you is that in real life this movie would have ended much much differently and it wouldn't have been an ending that would make Hollywood execs jump outta their seats and applaud. That last ten minutes has you in so much suspense you can barely breathe it almost kills you. You can practically smell the gunpowder. A great crime drama and worthy of just praise. It should have gotten even more attention that it received it's destined for classic status. Five out of five stars.",Null,0,1,9 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatest Sci-fi movie ever conceived
","And the funny part of this is it is not a science fiction movie. Like Mark Hamill says it is a fantasy! I did not realize this for almost 20 years. The plot elements are all there for a fairy tale. A white knight, a princess, and an evil lord. When I saw this film for the first time I was eight years old. I saw it on laser disc and it blew my mind. I thought 'This absolutely has to be the coolest movie ever made and that guy in the black costume is the most evil looking guy who ever lived.' I believe Darth Vader was number three on the Best Villain List after The Devil and Adolf Hitler. Even now I still think so. I can't believe there is a single person on the face of the Earth who hasn't seen it and if there is I pity them more than I can say. I can't wait for the trilogy to come out on a deluxe edition DVD set. That's the one you're gonna want to own. May the Force be with us.",10,3,5,8 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The most highly anticipated sequel of all time
","And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering 'the world is not flat it's round' surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying 'Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!' or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that 'This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that.' As Hamill said so eloquently, 'In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!' I must also include Silent Bob's quote 'She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'.' It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect.",10,4,7,8 June 2005
Gladiator," The Ben-Hur of Our Generation
","Simply put it is the achievement of a lifetime for Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. Crowe finally solidified his place in the acting community with this flawless performance and hasn't let up since. I will never forget the look on his face when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor he looked like he had been told he just won the lottery as I am quite sure he was thinking he was gonna get rear ended yet again. From start to finish you are awestruck with how great this masterpiece is. Ancient Rome never looked so good and the beauty and intense savagery is captured like water in a bottle. It also puts every movie that came out that year to absolute shame without doubt or question. It stands toe to toe with the best epic movies of all time, including Braveheart, Spartacus, and of course Ben-Hur which was by mine and many other accounts the best epic movie ever made. They put together the best cast Hollywood could assemble and knocked out audiences all over the world. Phoenix puts on a great show and certainly deserved the acclaim given him for it I was disappointed he didn't win an Oscar but very glad he was nominated. Gladiator was the Academy's Best Picture and is the best movie of 2000.",10,0,1,4 April 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The apology for the Temple of Doom
","Even though I don't believe the public needed an apology for the Temple of Doom they just wanted one and Lucas felt obligated to hand one out. This movie is deliberately light hearted and more in tune with the first installment of the trilogy. Ford is great as always and so is Sean Connery even though if he was Harrison's father he would have been 12 when Ford was born. Jones is once again pitted against the most evil force known to man, the Nazis. This time they are coveting the most precious religious artifact in all of Christendom the Holy Grail. So Jones and son must race against the Huns to reclaim it before Hitler drinks out of it and lives forever only to discover that he unknowingly gave Indy a sample of his handwriting which will be used as evidence against him in his upcoming Nuremberg trial. Action, suspense, intrigue, betrayal, and of course love are all included. Soon to be followed by Indiana Jones IV which is hitting theaters summer of 2006 and will feature a 60 year old almost Social Security eligible Harrison Ford and a much updated plot line.",Null,11,22,18 November 2004
Goodfellas," The Mob...Revealed
","The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was.  'The Godfather' for the 90's minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family.  Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it's like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to 'score' more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy 'The Gent' and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry's wife.  A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia.  The best movie of 1990.",Null,4,6,29 August 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Action is ReBourne!!
","The eagerly anticipated sequel to the box office hit the Bourne Identity. Matt Damon resumes the role of Jason Bourne, the amnesiac assassin who believes that the now defunct agency Treadstone is still after him and his girlfriend Marie. When a CIA operation to buy stolen Russian documents goes south and their agents are killed, the CIA blames Bourne and sets out to capture him. But insiders know that Jason Bourne is not really Jason Bourne, that name was just a cover for agent David Webb (Damon). Someone has assumed the Bourne Identity and is using it to frame him. When the real killer botches an attempt on Webb's life, Webb assumes that Treadstone is out to get him and decides to avenge himself. Joan Allen plays the bumbling CIA agent in charge of capturing/killing Bourne. Her dimwitted character has a real hard on to take down Jason but very slowly begins to realize that Bourne/Webb is no ordinary run of the mill thief and murderer but a highly skilled and trained expert killer who is now giving himself orders and neither she nor anybody else can stop him. I don't want to rip on this movie I truly truly loved it but I'm about to. This movie was comparable to the original in every respect with the major exception being that some morons (insert cinematographer and director's names here) decided to use the dreaded 'steadi-cam' to film the action sequences with the result being that it gave many people motion sickness (not me remarkably even though I sat close in the theater) and you couldn't see what was going on which pi$$es you off to no end. A major faux paus if they were in a Schwarzenegger movie they would be slated for termination the two of them. My other two smaller complaints were that the original actor for the character Picot was not recasted to fight Jason as the last member of Treadstone and that Julia Stiles role was limited to about two minutes (maybe less I didn't check my watch) and delegated to little more than a cameo. I call that 'I was in the movie for two seconds now give me some money!' acting. Not her fault at all but she should have gotten more screen time. The upside to this film was they spent less time in formulating and developing a complicated plot unlike the first one they simply picked up where Identity left off. This allowed more action sequences to be included and Damon more time to showcase his acting ability. And a rock solid performance from Brian Cox as the diabolical government official out to screw Jason and everybody else while he's at it. Yes this movie was great no it wasn't perfection like it could or should have been but it delivered the goods which is all you can expect from a sequel and more than you get from most. Just as good if not better in some respects. I have high hopes for a third and fourth movie and will be excited to watch them.",Null,0,1,16 August 2004
Cinderella Man," Yep, You Guessed It, Best Movie of 2005
","Probably the understatement of the year I just made for a summary. It's not even debatable. Russell just keeps knocking us out literally. Ron Howard, thank you again. Paul Gimatti, a shoe-in for best supporting actor nod. Good performance by Renee Zellwegger, and also Craig Bierko, if it looks like a killer and acts like a killer it must be a killer. Bravo my friend your stock went through the roof in my book. I also want to congratulate Howard on maintaining the essence of reality and historical accuracy it went far beyond normal expectations of the vast majority of hard core movie fanatics. If this film doesn't snag at least 5 Oscar nominations I will boycott my TV set for two weeks. People, watch this film. I don't care if you don't like boxing this went far beyond a boxing film. It is riches to rags to riches story, an uplifting story, even a feel good movie. It has a great message and some high caliber acting.",10,0,1,2 January 2006
V for Vendetta," An interesting piece of fiction with nonfiction overtones
","The funny thing about this film is that many misguided and uneducated people will see this as a slap against the Bush Administration and its handling of the war on terror and in Iraq (evidenced by the actual news clip segments and commentary which includes 'America' in it). The creators of this film may have made suggestions pointing to that conclusion, be they unintentional or intentional (and I suspect they were intentional). Nothing could be further from the real truth. There are two points here. One, this is a revenge flick, Hence the title, V for Vendetta. And two, if there is any slap to be delivered here, it is against tyranny and dictators, such as Chairman Mao, Pol Pot, Tito, Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Castro, Saddam, Ida Amin, Pinochet, Kim Jong II and countless other rulers who have cruelty exploited and brutally suppressed the masses in order to assume a totalitarian rule over a country (which also includes many of the Kings of England, France, and Russia). The themes of love, friendship, honor, justice, truth, devotion, and patriotism take a backseat. You may call them window-dressing, I would call them by-products. I felt it was my obligation to stress this isn't a political film and I would not be detoured from viewing it just because someone could make an argument that it is.",9,0,1,27 August 2006
The Godfather," THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. PERIOD.
","That I've seen anyway and I have seen more movies than most people except Siskel and Ebert. What else do you want me to say? Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give the best performances imaginable and the best of their respective careers as Don Vito and Michael Corleone, father and son who shall we say do not share the same frame of mind when it comes to the family biz. Don Vito is grooming his oldest son Santoro aka Sonny (James Caan) to take over from him and be the boss of the most powerful crime family in New York yet dotes on his second son Michael and sees him as destined for greatness. However, Michael, having returned from Army Service in WWII wants nothing to do with his father's illegitimate empire yet forces beyond his control cause him to become embroiled in its dirty politics despite his sincere attempts to steer clear of it. Attempted assassinations and murders quickly ensue and threaten to destroy Michael and his family that he loves. This masterpiece of art and cinema deals with many themes: love, honor, sacrifice, betrayal, and power are some of them. The central and most important one is FAMILY and that is the focus of the whole story. If the viewer doesn't understand that they will never understand this film at all. And that is why I and so many others believe this is the greatest movie ever made.",Null,1,6,1 October 2004
