Moneyball," Why?
","Not a Brad Pitt fan -- when I watch him I never forget that it's HIM -- he doesn't seem to disappear into his roles (like Phillip Seymour Hoffman could do). Anyway, the high marks and buzz about this movie along with Jonah Hill's rave reviews made me take a look. But for more than two hours I wondered 'Where is this thing going?' There seemed to be no real point to it, no real payoff, nothing. Once again, Pitt confirmed my earlier perception and he was always... him. An actor reciting a script in a movie that had no message aside from a new take on hiring players. Certainly not enough to hold my attention, and it makes me wonder how may layers of approvals it had to get -- or if the eye candy was enough to get executives to give it a green light.",3,4,7,22 June 2014
Lost in Translation," Makes Boring Seem Exciting
","A bad travelogue. How long did they want me to wait and watch this lady in her room, on the street, back in her room, in the bar and then back in her room? Bill Murray tried, but he couldn't make this slow-paced, molasses movie move an inch. Pointless and a waste of time.",2,2,4,9 February 2004
The Bourne Ultimatum," A Plodding Cartoon About Bureaucracy
","I counted about 4-5 action sequences, and the rest was the trite clich√© of a bunch of agents in a dark room playing with computers that create only-in-the-movies graphics and speaking to each other through dialogue was as mundane and predictable as the acting. If you're ready to sit through two hours of dark rooms and suspicious looks and obvious foreshadowing and sinister motives made by people you assumed were sinister to begin with, then this is right up your alley. Add to this the annoyingly persistent cinema verite/hand-held camera style to add unnecessary drama to ordinary situations and you've got yourself a flawed movie there, pappy. The least impressive follow-up to two very impressive movies.",6,0,4,6 August 2007
Marriage Story," I Saw it Coming
","While I give credit to the writer/director (who some people have heard of, although I hadn't) for being able to create a film, what he created was... what? My wife and I watched it last night and, from the beginning, I could tell this was going to be syrupy, self-indulgent, molasses-slow movie that, I assume, drew from his background in theatre and film. The characters in the stock company, the neurotic sister who acted like a child, the child who acted like a brat, the mediator who plays a cartoon character, and the dialogue between the two lawyers that I could visualize being delivered at a table reading kept me at a distance. Then there was the loooooooooong monologue delivered by the lead actress that, as she shared it with her lawyer, seemed so artificial and contrived that I felt sorry for her that she had to read what I'd imagine the writer thought would be an epic presentation. Like the lawyers' dialogue, you could visualize the writer knocking it out and the actress trying to make it real. Instead, all you hear is a Hollywood actress reading a Hollywood director's lines and without the illusion of reality -- which carries all the way through the ten hours of this two-hour film -- it's difficult to get into it. How this got six Academy Award nominations is anyone's guess. Maybe it's an inside joke.",3,6,17,9 February 2020
