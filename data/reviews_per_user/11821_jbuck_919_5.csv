Vertigo," I'm of a different opinion
","I've seen this movie several times and simply do not understand why it is consistently rated Hitchcock's best.  I'm not sure which would be the best, but I might vote for 'North by Northwest.'For one thing, it is overly long.  The scenes where 'Scotty' patrols the streets of San Francisco looking for 'Madeline' go on forever to no purpose. Though Hitchcock could pull off some improbabilities, the entire premise of this movie is flawed.  That the man would go into an asylum in such a deranged state when the original Madeline dies is extremely improbable.  The character 'Midge' disappearing so early in the film doesn't make sense.  The 'nightmare sequence' is a cartoonish retake of the one in 'Spellbound.' Finding the same girl again and remaking her into what he remembers is beyond impossible.  Discovering her ruse because of the extremely obvious pendant looks like a quick way to end the movie.  Him not still loving her and taking violent action against her is a plot twist worthy of a B movie. It is never explained how an ex-cop could live a fancy lifestyle in S.F. and 'keep' a mistress. In short, this is an overrated movie without a shred of credibility, and no really impressive performances.   And, frankly, no Hitchcokian suspense. You wanna see Stewart and Kim Novak in a MOVIE?  Watch Bell, Book, and Candle.",Null,3,7,6 June 2002
The Sound of Music," Has anybody noticed? (Yes, a couple of drawbacks)
","By all means, enjoy this movie as I have for many years.  Never in any way did it merit holding the record as the top box office hit for as long as it did.All filmings of Rodgers and Hammerstein, with the exception of The King and I and the little known State Fair, present problems.  Two neat numbers from the play are excised and replaced with two truly atrocious ones ('Confidence in Confidence Alone' and 'I Must Have Done Something Good,' which is the setting for what may be the most unintentionally laughable scene in all movie history, pace Ben Hur). There are other defects of detail.  Why does Maria tell the children that the Laendler is an 'Austrian' folk dance?  They know that they are Austrian.  They would also know about the dance by this time.  The last choral 'goodnight' in 'So Long, Farewell' makes one want to gag.  Then there's the literally sickening sugar-sweet plot, unique among R&H major musicals, which usually have some kind of dramatic bite.  Oh, well, they weren't the only ones to waste great numbers on a lousy book.  Enjoy it for the justly famous numbers (forget Do-Re-Mi; it goes on forever, and the fifth degree is 'sol,' not 'sew') and for the luscious scene where the captain and Maria dance the Laendler as a pas de deux.",Null,4,13,8 June 2002
The Caine Mutiny," Character of Willie Keith
","The board has voted and the result is unanimous.  This film has been thoroughly reviewed here, but having seen it this evening again on tv I feel the need to put in my two cents worth.Some reviewers have read the novel, some haven't.  I'm in the former category, in spades.  One wonders how Wouk could have dropped the ball so badly after writing such a great first novel.The play 'The Caine Mutiny Court Martial' drops the Willie Keith story entirely, a sensible decision.  But Willie is the central character of the novel.  The film is flawed by including his character and love interest at all at the same time it revolves around the concept of all star casting.Willie is not supposed to be a handsome callow youth.  He is in fact overweight and suffers from lordosis.  He only gets into the navy because the doctor feels guilty that he kept Willie waiting all day.  Willie should look a little like the actor who plays Alfred in Miracle on 34th Street. Richard Dreyfuss might have managed the part.  This very complex, almost Shakespearean plot involves not only everything that the movie shows, but Willie's coming of age.  In fact, at the end, he captains and then decomissions the Caine as a much changed young man.  It must have been an impossibility for the producers to reconcile everything within Wouk's incredible novel.  But instead of their silly compromise with pretty boy Robert Francis and 'May Wynn,' they should have written a whole new character who is seen only in the context of the dynamics of the Caine. That's major re-writing, but if you can get those kinds of performances out of an all-star cast that knocks your socks off, the other obvious adjustment should have been there too.",Null,1,1,4 August 2002
Good Will Hunting," I had a harder time than others with this movie
","An incredibly handsome working class boy with little formal education who knows absolutely everything and can outthink the finest university mathematician is not unlikely--it is impossible.  Take it from a mathematician.  If you care for a shred of credibility in your movies, forget this one.  It is pure fantasy, as is the director's other shamelessly self-indulgent movie, the low-budget 'My Own Private Idaho.'",Null,0,1,5 June 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," A dissenting view
","No folks, I promise not to do the same thing to the Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind, but this has got to be the most overrated movie of all time.It took me a number of tries to watch it all the way through, because it is so incredibly boring.  All the scenarios are exaggerated without a hint of the whimsy or joy that should mark  a Christmas movie.  NOBODY in it is likeable, including the hapless and almost hopeless hero.  They even give Donna Reed an improbable scene in the alternate reality where she is a total... well, if I want this posted, I can't use the word.But the worst flaw?  THEY NEVER GET BACK THE MONEY THAT WAS STOLEN.  It is morally unacceptable that this guy doesn't get punished and the townspeople have to rush in with a bailout.I've heard this movie praised to the highest heavens as one of the ten best ever made for most of my life.  I'll give them credit for the body language between Donna Reed and James Stewart in the scene where he is on the phone, but not for much else.",Null,15,29,6 June 2002
