Lucky Number Slevin," Take the time to edit out about 20 minutes of this movie, and we have a winner!
","Just saw this last night, and as they revealed the :noes:athon, my rating of the movie just kept falling and falling.Too much of the movie was about the actual truth, and there wasn't enough setup. The Usual Suspects was an AWESOME movie because Verbal's story led us along for the two hours, and then in less than a minute, the truth unraveled. The longer they drew out the 'shock,' it just got less and less shocking. The effect kept getting diluted until I just didn't care.Also, a big aspect in any story is the romance. It's either a part of the background, or a big driving force. In this film, what was it? It started off as a background romance, but then at the end they try to make Hartnett and Liu's romance important. And then they kind of got lazy and let the pen go off wherever kind of like how I'm doing because the movie bad something something.It started off OK, but there were so many times when we were made to suspend disbelief (while being aware of how contrived the situation is), or told to look left when we knew something was going to happen on the right, that a film with some solid strengths just became bogged down in the weaknesses.",6,0,2,3 March 2007
