The Blair Witch Project," exaggerated - don't read if you haven't seen it yet
","well i too got sucked into the hype of this movie and went to see it tonight.  my friends said it was really really good and really really scary. i went in positive and with an open mind.  unfortunately, after an hour or so i started to get really annoyed and bored. i don't know about anyone else, but i saw a clear line, exactly where the characters started to crack. it wasn't a gradual deterioration - it was almost all of a sudden.  okay *now*!  let's just completely flip out and start crying.  i mean, it's maryland.  even the characters themselves said, 'this is america' you just can't get lost like that - they had a compass and that should be good enough.  if you walk straight you should eventually hit a road or something. mike never even seemed like he wanted to do this right from the beginning - so why did he?  his attitude was completely annoying.  the only character i liked was josh cuz he didn't say a whole lot of annoying things.  heather i felt got a little far-fetched at times.  i'd like to see her get lost in the middle of downtown manhatten. the issue of leaving it all up to our imaginations is cool - but dammit, like others have said, it's way too vague.  i went into the moving knowing *this* much of the Blair Witch, and i came out of the theatre knowing *this* much of the Blair Witch, and $10 broker. besides the characters' clumsiness of either disappearing, or i guess hanging themselves, there would have been no movie at all.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," yay!
","well i actually got to see the very first showing of Phantom Menace at midnight on the 18th.  was brilliant!  i enjoyed every minute of it!  i was curious for the longest time, if it still would have an old skool 'star warsy' feel to it, and it totally has it thru and thru.  was nice to see C-3PO and R2D2 again - they are meant to be together that's for sure! acting was *excellent* all around - the only thing that bothered me a little, was that there was *WAY* too much computer animation.  i can't imagine what Episode 3 is going to be like; watch that one with full on computer animation, and then watch Episode 4 right after with its modest effects.  oh well =)",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
American Psycho," i am Patrick Bateman; we're all Patrick Bateman
","i have read the book MANY times (cuz it's damn good) and i was so excited to see this movie.  i saw it tonight, and i think it does alright!  tho i reallly think everyone should read the book before seeing it.  i put myself in someone's shoes who hasn't read the book, and the movie might not make much sense.  but for me, it has re-confirmed that i *am* patrick bateman. he is to me, a figure of what jealousy, hate, greed, fear, confusion, sadness, etc, etc all are, bundled into a character.  i chose to see the murders in the book as well as the movie more on the psychological tip, where we have all murdered people in our heads.  how many times have we gotten jealous and said, 'i could kill so and so' or hated someone for something, and uttered, 'if i see so and so next time...'.  those very thoughts are the murders that we read about in the book, and see on screen. patrick doesn't have a problem with murder as some people have commented. it's not the murder that is the problem at all.  for me i hate commercialism and how society makes you feel ugly if you do not conform.  i hate it, but i have to do it in order to survive; i am conforming, working at a job i dont' really like, paying too much for shoes that fall apart after 1 month, worrying too much about how fast my computer runs.  but i try to  take time out to focus on nature and the beauty of being alive when i get the chance to.  it's the only way to stay sane.",Null,0,0,23 April 2000
Meet Joe Black," too good
","i watched this movie i think 5 times in theatre back when it was just out in november '98.  it was one of those movies or stories that hit me so personally.  i fully understood what i was supposed to get out of this story.  i cried like a nutta, and then i realized how valuable our lives are.  i realized how lucky i am to have my parents around still - i had to tell them i appreciated all they've done for me after i saw this.  a couple of my friends have died since i've seen this movie (freak accidents *sigh*), and again, this topic of death washed over me again for a good few months. death is a part of our lives, and it's good to point it out now and then and remind us that we could lose loved ones anyday.the acting was brilliant, and so was the musical score.  yay for all the cast!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
