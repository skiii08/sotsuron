Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fun and exciting, but Jar Jar Binks should die horribly
","The movie itself was really good.  It didn't live up to all the hype surrounding it, but then again, what ever does?  If you don't go in with these lofty expectations, I think you'll find the movie quite entertaining and fun.Now I'm going to nitpick, these didn't necessarily make the movie bad, but they did suck.1. Jar Jar Binks should be completely cut out of the movie.  He's a stupid and annoying character.  (For those of you who don't know, he's the fully CG character that follow Qui Jon and Obi-wan around.)2. The little innuendo's between Anakin and Queen Amadalia were just a little too 'ew ew, he's 9 and you're 17!! EW!!!'3. Don't scientifically try to explain the force.  Its just the force.  (I'll let you see the movie to explain this, its a minor point, but annoying.)4. Lightsabers should be able to cut through forcefields damnit!  That's why they're such a damn cool weapon. (Once again, see the movie.)Now parts that I REALLY enjoyed.1. Darth Maul.  All I can say, without giving anything away, is that he's bar none THE coolest character in Star Wars.  Even though he has like 5 lines, his presence, and sword technique are just WAY TOO COOL. Trust me, you'll be blown away by the fights that he has, especially with the 2 jedi at once.  DAMN cool!2. Senator Palpatine/Darth Sideous.  He was great as well!  He did a good job conveying a certain duality, while remaining manipulative, good job!3. R2D2: All I can say is that droid rocked out!  I really liked him in the movie.  I've always wanted an astromech droid, and I now want one even more.  C3P0 was cool too, just because you could see these cool spinney things in his head!  *grin*4. The cameos.  All I'll say about this is look for some cool things on Tatoine.  Especially in the pod race, sitting on the mountains, 'watching' the race. ;)I'm going to go and try to see this movie again this coming weekend when I go home.  There are just SO many things that go whizzing by, that I want to have another look-see to see what I missed.So enjoy.  Go see the movie if you can get tickets, it's well worth it!",8,0,0,21 May 1999
Being John Malkovich," Jeung's Collective Consciousness
","First off, let me emphasize that as a movie year, 1999 has been on of the best in recent memory.  Being John Malkovich has to be THE most original movie this past year, and one of the best overall.  The basic premise is that a puppet maker, John Cusack, takes a filing job at a strange office on the 7 1/2 floor.  While digging behind one of his filing cabinets he discovers a portal into actor John Malkovich's head.  From that point the movie takes on a truly surrealistic direction.  Eventually there are hundreds of people paying money to spend 15 minutes in John Malkovich's head, witnessing various mundane things like Taxi rides, to the more exotic, like having sex.  This movie also had me asking questions, that were answered later on like, what happens if John Malkovich goes into the portal into his head.  It is an intriguing journey into our more primal fantasies, essentially playing on Psychologist Jeung's collective unconsciousness, twisting it into a 'collective consicousness'.  The movie is quite Freudian in the primal sense, yet drawing on some of the more modern behaviorist philosphies.  Let's all hope that Hollywood wakes up and sees that the 'blockbuster' is officially dead, and creative intelligent movies are back in full swing.  John Malkovich should be nominated for Best Actor this year. If you haven't seen this movie, go see it today.  Its on par with, IMHO, the best movie of the 90's, American Beauty.",10,0,0,6 January 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The Best Movie this Year bar none
","Yes, there is lots of hype for this movie, but in this case I think the hype is well deserved.  Unlike various other movies in this genre, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon manages to stand head and shoulders above the competition.  Why?  Simple, incredible acting.  Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and newcomer Zhang Ziyi are incredibly gifted actors, and truly show off their acting talents.  This move could have fallen flat and felt more like a videogame than a story, but it doesn't.  I can't wait for this movie to get a broader national release so that more people can experience this movie.  If you have not seen this, or if you're a bit warry of seeing a movie that is in chinese with english subtitles, don't be.  Visually this movie is stunning, the fight choreography is spectacular, and the love stories are well done.  In most movies that I see, action and adventure in particular, the love story is thrown in as more of an afterthought to 'get the girls' to come and see the movie.  I found the love story in this movie to be both very interesting and touching.  Another gripe that I hear people saying is that the flying and wall crawling are silly.  I just want to remind them that this is a particular style in China, much like Tolkienesque fantasy that we have here in the west.  I don't think it detracts from the movie but enhances its appeal.Musically this movie is beautiful.  Yoyo Ma did various cello pieces in this very traditional sounding yet maintaining the modern feel to it.  I see now why they were calling Chow Yun Fat the Humphrey Bogart of Asia, and I think he is better than Bogart at conveying emotion.  I think Michelle Yeoh stole the show with her performance.  I've been a huge fan of hers since I first saw her in Supercop, and have followed her ever since.  The other person that I'm really starting to respect is Wo Ping.  The fight scenes that he set up are just spectacular.  I found my jaw dropping at what I was watching on screen, and shouting and cheering the fighting.  It was beautiful, graceful, and stunning.  It also emphasizes the story, which is rare. Usually the fight scenes take away from a story to just show off a different type of 'special effect'.So to reiterate, this is by far the best movie of 2000.  I encourage everyone to see this movie, it is simply incredible.  I also agree with another reviewer here, I can't wait to get this on DVD. :)",Null,0,0,28 December 2000
