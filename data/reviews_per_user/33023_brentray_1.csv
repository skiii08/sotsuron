Requiem for a Dream," One of the most motivational movies I have ever seen.
","Some might say Requiem for a Dream is far too disturbing with too many controversial elements.  However it is a movie that truly gets its point across without any sort of doubt.  If you want to show someone something to get them to fight a drug addiction, show them this movie.  Guaranteed it will make them reconsider their actions and think about what they're doing. This movie is incredibly motivational, and I believe that the disturbing images are really what make it so powerful in this regard.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone, however I would recommend preparing yourself for a dark, meaningful movie.  Don't try to take this one lightheartedly.",10,0,0,20 February 2003
