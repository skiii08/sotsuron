The Avengers," Hollywoods Superhero Bar just got Raised!!!
","The Avengers is the best summer blockbuster for a long time, it balances all elements of fun, drama, action, special effects, multiple egos into a well directed, paced movie. The film has perfectly edited action set pieces, no fast editing like say transformers and it benefits hugely. The first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up, but after that the last hour especially is amazing. Credit has to go to the director, you really can tell he has a love for the source material and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film. The drama is not as dark as say the dark knight. As people have been saying it is a very funny film with some laugh out moments. The Avengers is simply amazing, Hollywood is in for a bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come, The Dark Knight Rises, Spider-Man, Skyfall, The Hobbit. The Avengers has started the summer blockbuster season with a bang and may end up being the best of them all in 2012. I highly recommend the Avengers.",9,2,7,27 April 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Great Adventure
","What can be said that hasn't already been said about Raiders of the lost ark. The film is classic Spielberg and Lucas in tandem, based on 1930's television serials Raiders of the lost ark ups the scale and budget and cemented the superstar status of Harrison Ford as a leading man. The action and overall tone of the movie is fast paced and creates a great sense of charm and adventure throughout. I am not sure how this film got a PG certificate upon release as some of the scenes are too graphic for children. Great work from Douglas Slocombe for the look/feel of Raiders, and Vic Armstrong for the stunt work in this film, which contains an amazing truck chase sequence. John Williams creates another legendary score after Star Wars and Jaws. Highly recommended.",10,0,0,13 April 2017
L.A. Confidential," LA Confidential is a Masterpiece
","LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.",10,1,2,26 June 2013
Predator," PREDATOR has become an science fiction /action classic
","Predator came out in 1987 and after a troublesome shoot it was well received with a modest box office return. Predator would later go on to become a action cult classic on video and DVD. Arnold Schwarzenegger had become a action movie star name after Conan, The Terminator, Commando, and The Running Man. One thing Arnold always did was take chances with original ideas and stories and made them work with his on screen charisma and very large screen presence. Predator is full of pumped up action men on a mission to find some hostages deep in the jungle behind enemy lines. Little do they know they will run into on of the best screen aliens ever to grace the cinema screen. The Predator was designed by Stan Winston with a little help from James Cameron and proves to be a almost unstoppable foe as it hunts down Arnold's team one by one. Predator is well filmed by action director John Mctiernan who would go on a year later to direct arguably the greatest action film ever Die Hard. Predator is fun to watch and filled with terrific one liners by all the cast. Like most films in the 80s the content is graphic and the action never holds back. It is a shame the Predator series went downhill after this first film, the second film has some great set pieces, but something just seemed missing (Arnold) hopefully one day another great predator film will be made with an original plot. I highly recommend Predator for an action / science fiction audience. Arnold Schwarzenegger wet on to star in even bigger Action hits Total Recall, Terminator 2, and True Lies. Cementing his status as possibly Hollywood's greatest action hero.",8,0,1,26 June 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great First Installment
","Peter Jackson taking on The Lord of the Rings books and creating a live action trilogy of films was a gigantic undertaking. One which paid off in creating one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. If all three films were one continuous film it would easily be the greatest film of all time. It all started with this first chapter being a commercial and critical success. I enjoy Fellowship of the ring the most out of all three films, its world is created with total love of the source material. Including great Sfx and model work, along with stunning vistas of New Zealand. Peter Jackson however never forgets that it his is characters that keep his world small and intimate. Great works especially from Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Vigo Mortensen whom anchor the entire film series. I find it hard to find anyone in the entire cast whom is not well suited to their roles. The story contains epic battles, friendships, death, love, hope, freedom. Try and watch the excellent extended edition. The film is recommended to anyone old enough watch it, it is a truly outstanding piece of cinema that will be remembered for a long time to come.",10,1,1,13 April 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," T2 - The first 100 Million Dollar Movie
","Terminator 2 is an amazing action packed movie from writer / director James Cameron. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game returning to play the cyborg the T-800, his most famous movie role. James Cameron's love of Science Fiction and action coupled with the latest film making technology pushed the boundaries in 1991 to their limit. James Cameron uses classical action shots that allow the viewer to see what is going on at all times, something newer film makers/ editors should pay attention to. The reason this film works so well is down to the story itself and the concepts it deals with, James Cameron always writes interesting stories for us to think about but were he differs to 99% of other directors is he merges this with jaw dropping set pieces filmed with energy, often a moving camera shot he totally understands that this is an entertainment medium, he never forgets about his characters though and this why his films always have heart. Terminator 2 is one of the best action / science fiction films of all time, James Cameron is the best action director of all time and Terminator 2 is proof of that.",10,6,7,27 April 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers : Age of Repetition
","Avengers age of Ultron fails to deliver topping the original Avengers movie. On a positive note it is an entertaining movie blockbuster very similar to the original except the action and humour are not as sharp as the previous instalment. There is a darker tone to this film then the previous entry, but in some ways not dark enough.It is hard to explain but something just seems very disjointed this time around our main heroes never seem emotionally engaged or in any kind of real danger like I feel they should be, maybe this is down to Ultron being a Cgi character as opposed to Loki being human in the original, maybe the actors found it hard too interact with an army of Cgi robots all the time. After the great Winter Solider last year I had high hopes for the Avengers age of Ultron. I am glad that the Russo brothers will be taking over from Joss Whedon after this film, he made a great first Avengers film but should of had the foresight to create something different this time rather then make a sequel like so many other sequels that just fall flat, he has admitted having a nightmare while making this movie and I think it shows. However it will still be a financial success because of the brand. New characters Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch are welcome additions, but still fail to add any emotional depth to the film. Scarlett Witch is given better material to work with then Quicksilver. I am sure the future will still be bright for the Avengers, especially after Civil War next year. Overall maybe Marvel and Disney's first stumble so far in this series after the fabulous Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy last year.",7,4,10,23 April 2015
Total Recall," Totally Rewarding
","Total recall came out in 1990 and was another hit for it's leading man Arnold Schwarzenegger. Again Schwarzenegger choose to enter the world of science fiction coupled with action as he had previous success with The Terminator, The Running Man, and Predator. Arnold sort out the services of the impressive Dutch Director Paul Verhoeven whom had success with 1987's Robocop. Verhoeven was not a science fiction director, however his greatest films have all been set in the science fiction genre.The great thing about Verhoeven as a director is he always asks questions of his audience, and makes them think about the message he is putting across in all his films. His films do use excessive graphic content and nudity, so he is not for everyone. It is almost like comic book violence at times. The 80s action films audience expected graphic violence, as we entered the 90s action films would steadily use less graphic violence Total Recall is set in the future and is about the character Douglas Quiad (Schwarzenegger) or is it? Quaid is a construction worker who keeps dreaming of mars. He can not convince his wife, played by the very sexy Sharon Stone to go on holiday to mars. So Quiad takes matters into his own hands and goes for a implanted memory of a holiday to mars. As Quiad awakes he thinks that people are coming to kill him, but is he just living his implanted memory or not? Does he really have a previous life and his identity as Douglas Quaid is just a set up. As like most of the science fiction films around at this time for example Terminator 2, it is filled with original ideas and makes it a intelligent plot line and can be thought of as deeply as the viewer feels necessary or just enjoyed as a action film. Action films these days seem to have lost the plot when it comes to over use of cgi at the expense of a good story. Total Recall is good thinking man's science fiction film and is highly recommended, kudos to the film makers and Arnold Schwarzenegger for making this film possible as a large budgeted film with star backing.",9,2,4,26 June 2013
Eyes Wide Shut," Final Masterpiece
","Stanly Kubrick is among the greatest film directors of all time and his final film is just as layered and beautiful as his previous works. I have always enjoyed Eyes Wide Shut even though after my first and even second viewing I was left with an anti climatic feeling, however the film stays with you and you begin to think about it. Just like all his other works there is something that keeps you going back and discovering something else you did not notice before. His films change as you change with age, giving you new perspectives on not just the films subjects but also your own life. This film is immaculately directed and among the best films to be ever be lit, the constant use of Christmas lights in almost every scene gives the film a dreamy like feeling. I know that Kubrick was looking to change the medium of film again, and the lighting in this film certainly did that. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play their parts well, and like all Kubrick characters there is something off about them. The film like 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the Shining is very much left open to interpretation, Kubrick liked to make his films as ambiguous and allow the viewer to make up their own minds as to what they have just watched. I highly recommend this film, especially to film students. It is created by someone who has a lifetime of knowledge in the film industry and was known as a perfectionist. Thank you Stanly and everyone that was involved in the creation of this great piece of art.",10,0,1,13 April 2017
Titanic," Filmmaking on the Grandest Scale
","James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired. I highly recommend Titanic and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible, films like this do not come along often. The 3d Blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d.",10,3,3,13 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Awakens
","After thinking about the films for several hours after seeing it, and being initially disappointed. I can say that Star Wars the Force Awakens is well crafted film that captures the spirit of the original trilogy very well. The new cast members all perform well and create a new set of heroes and villains. Older cast members are also great especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Daisy Ridley as Rey. The film moves along at pace, similar to the first Star Wars film and is essentially a chase movie for the first hour of its run time. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is an interesting villain, which has conflicting issues to deal with, and is quite a nut case that has hissy fits. My main gripe with the film is the plot line of the Starkiller base, being too similar to the death star of the original trilogy. There was really no need for this plot line, just having Kylo Ren looking for Luke Skywalker was enough. Also would the rebellion not of known about the creation of such a base well before its construction? I also feel that Luke Skywalker would not abandon His truest friends, I do understand there is a lot gone on since Return of the Jedi that could of driven a wedge between their friendships. Luke however would of sensed what was going on with signals in the force and surely of helped, I feel his appearance was purely to set up the next film. Although the resistance claims victory it feels like a subdued win because of events of the attack on the Star killer base. The action is well filmed and the lightsaber battles are raw and feel dangerous. Overall this is a good film and a return to the film making beats of the original trilogy. It had unachievable hype to live up too, but the mix of old and new bond well, it is exciting to see what happens next in the Star Wars Saga....",8,8,26,16 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars - The film that changed everything
","Star Wars is one of the most important films Hollywood has ever produced, it marked a huge turning point in the way films were made and marketed. George Lucas struggled for years to make this film happen, he is a true visionary of cinema and people should never forget that. His ambition and creative mind allowed the world of Star Wars to come to fruition. To me Star Wars is Cinema, it has the classical story of rescue the princess but set in space. However it is the way that George Lucas told the story, amazing visual effects, bombastic sound, mythical plot points merged with very likable characters, all of which was refreshing for Hollywood in the late 70's, people were entertained again. The 70s were a special decade for film, many great modern classic films were produced by Hollywood's younger talent, Spielberg, Scorsese, Coppola, Ridley Scot, De Palma, Kubrick. But Star Wars created hysteria on a global scale and is unlikely to ever be seen again on this level. So to George Lucas thank you very much for giving us Star Wars and influencing so many of the great blockbuster film makers we have today including James Cameron and Christopher Nolan, without Star Wars Hollywood would be a very different place.",10,0,0,27 April 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Violent but extremely fun spy adventure
","Kingsman like Kick Ass is a action packed and comedic film from X-men first class director Matthew Vaughn. It is well made and filmed with confidence which is refreshing after a spade of disappointing action films like The Expendables 3, Taken 3 for example. Imagine if Matthew Vaughn was allowed to direct an Expendables. This is a violent film but it is filmed in a manor that is in-between soft core action of again something like Expendables 3 and Graphic action of say something like Robocop making it both accessible to both audiences. The film has been marketed in a way which well respected actors such as Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, and Michael Caine are all involved in a comedy / adventure film, which is true, however anyone that has seen Kick Ass will know what is going to happen. I applaud the three above for their involvement in something they would normally not take on, they all give good performances, as well as Matthew Vaughn regular Mark Strong. The two young leads also give good performances, however I think Samuel L Jackson steals the show with strong support from Colin Firth.The film is good fun and deserves all the success I am sure it will receive. 2015 is going to be one hell of a year",8,9,17,29 January 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Kinetic Awesomeness
","Mad Max Fury Road is a stunningly beautiful and highly charged kinetic thrill ride. It is brilliantly filmed with amazing, and well suited bombastic soundtrack. The star of the film is its direction by George Miller, showing generation MTV how to direct moving action without getting lost in its mayhem. Almost every shot is moving, similar to a James Cameron action sequence. As mentioned before the film has not got much of a plot other then a giant chase. The first half of the film is great and the second half starts to loose steam due to what has come before it. Chalize Theron is great and adds presence to the film, it is one of her best performances. Tom Hardy gives a solid performance but I found his performance somewhat lacking, he does not have much to work with and is limited to a handful of dialogue, I preferred Mel Gibson's Max. The film suffers when it eventually slows down in pace, but when it is going full throttle there are not many films that can complete with it. Is it an action classic? as a chase film , yes I would say it is, along with set design and stunt work involved But the lack of any real story and small plot holes stop me giving this film a 10, not much is explained in the film. The ending seems sudden and could of done with some more depth to it, especially the Max character. It is still a wonderful and refreshingly directed film to add to the Mad Max Cannon of films.",9,43,76,15 May 2015
