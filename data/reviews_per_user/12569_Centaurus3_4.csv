One Hundred and One Dalmatians," 6 out of 8 in the Silver Era
","Due to the under performance of Sleeping Beauty, many changes were made in the studio, and they had to lower the budgets of their films, thus the Xerography process. Two years after Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians was the first film to be made in Xerography, and is considered the start of the Dark Ages to many people.The story is about a dog couple named Pongo and Perdita, who give birth to 15 puppies. An old friend of their owner Anita named Cruella DeVil comes by to attempt to buy the puppies, but when Anita's husband Roger refuses, she storms off and sends two men to kidnap them. They end up with 84 more puppies, and Pongo and Perdita has to rescue them before the 99 Dalmatians are skinned for fur coat.The characters in the movie are alright. Roger and Anita are your modern, quirky couple, Pogo and Perdita are your everyday dogs, and the Dalmatians are... Dalmatians. The breakthrough and the most memorable character in this movie is the infamous Cruella DeVil. She is so classy yet trashy at the same time, and is so rambunctious. Her sidekicks are the enjoyable bumbling fools.There is only one song in this movie called 'Cruella DeVil'. It has a sophisticated jazzy sound to it, and the score is decent.The animation is a HUGE change from all of its predecessors. The xerography process gives the film this trashy, lazy look that makes the film look cheap, so it is not as good as the other films. This is one of the few films where the xerography process looks good, but it is still not up to par with the earlier films.This film has your attention, even though the plot is not necessarily strong and the characters are not the most endearing. It is an entertaining, fun film which the family will like, even though it is not as good as the other films.",7,1,2,20 April 2013
The Jungle Book," 8th out of 8 in the Silver Era
","Four years after 'The Sword in the Stone', Walt Disney's final animated feature was released in October 1967; 10 months after his death. This film would be the last major memorable hit the studio would have Dow a few decades.The story is about a boy who was raised by wolves (Mowgli), has to return back to the man village because of the tiger Shere Khan's return to the jungle. Bagheera the panther, Baloo the bear, and Mowgli have a fun and dangerous adventure back to the village.The characters in this movie are all memorable and likable. Mowgli is the typical 10 year old who wants to live a carefree life by not going to society, Baloo is the bear who is very fun and relaxed (he sings the famous 'Bare Necessities'), Bagheera is the responsible one who wants the best for Mowgli. Shere Khan is the perfect intimidating yet classy tiger villain, and Kaa is a sneaky, manipulative snake who just wants to eat.The soundtrack is very memorable and to a lot of people, it is the best aspect of the film. The songs 'Bare Necessities' and 'I Wanna Be Like You' are catchy, jazzy tunes and all of the other songs are nice. The score in this movie is very effective.The animation in this movie is OK. It does not really mesh well with the background, but at the same time, the animation is not horrible. Here is where the reused animation is very noticeable, which gives it a cheap look. It being animated using Xerography does not help.With an alright story, memorable characters, memorable songs, and alright animation, this film is a bunch of fun. Good, not great or bad, but it will be an enjoyable film for the entire family.",7,2,4,28 April 2013
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," 1st out of 5 in the Golden Age
","Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether.The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her.Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White.The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright.The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like 'Heigh Ho', and 'Someday My Prince Will Come' add more depth into our characters and the story. PerfectIf you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason",8,2,2,12 April 2013
Cinderella," 1st out of 8 in the Silver Era
","After spending most of the 1940s with package films, Disney was on turmoil with this last film and if it was successful, they would make more movies but if they were not, they would close the studio, and this film was a big hit in 1950.The story is about a young woman named Cinderella who has become a servant in her own home by her own stepmother. When the royal family throws a ball for Prince Charming's return, Cinderella sneaks out of her house to go to the ball, and unknowingly bumps into Prince Charming.The plot is not the most complicated, as it is practically the same as the fairy tale, but they perform it so well. The characters are also very interesting, except Prince Charming. Cinderella is a nice, genuine, spunky (for the classic princesses), level eased girl. Lady Tremaine is a crude, selfish, manipulative villain, who has so much impact in everything she is doing; great villain. The stepsisters are Lady Tremaine's pawns, but their foolish, bratty behaviour is hilarious. The King is extremely cold and enjoyable at the same time, but he does not come off as extremely threatening. Prince Charming is barely in the movie, and faces the same problems that Snow's Prince had (they could not animate a realistic male character yet). The mice are cute, fun characters that provide our comic relief.The songs, everybody remembers them, from 'A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes', 'Bibbidi Bobbidi Bo', 'So This Is Love', etc. they are so soothing, and not overly energetic and fast. Disney's most memorable songs are in this movie.The animation is top notch. It is so stylistic, and the backgrounds are so beautiful. Cinderella's design, as all the other characters (excluding Prince Charming) are designed really well, and Disney really got the character movements down. This is one of the best animated movies they have ever done.Everything flows well with this movie, and the only thing that I wish would have been better is if they took away some of the scenes with the mice, so we could have seen more of what the royals were thinking, but this movie is practically flawless.This film is perfect for the entire family. Little girls will like the dresses and mice, boys will love the slapstick humour, and the adults will enjoy the animation, story, and the undertones of the movies. You should definitely give this movie a look.",9,1,3,16 April 2013
