Gremlins," Gremlins-A great 84 movie
","Anybody who doesn't like this movie just doesn't understand comedy.  I thought this movie was excellent.  It's about a son who got a Mowagi for Christmas, a cute furry animal that sings.  The only thing is there are 3 simply rules you have to follow.  Don't get them wet, don't feed them after midnight, and bright light can kill them.  Sounds easy enough till he accidentlly spills water on them and instantly 3 or 4 others pop right out his Gizmo (voice by the wonderful Howie Mandel from St. Elsewhere).  One night the Mowagis were begging for food, looking at the clock and seeing it wasn't quite midnight, Billy gives in and feeds them some chicken.  When he wakes up the next morning they are in a nasty looking cocoon.  All hell breaks loose when the mowagi, now gremlins, hatch and the town goes into haywire.  They manage to kill all but one of the gremlins, Spike the leader. They trap him in the store and Gizmo saves the day by making the blinds raise showering Spike with bright lights just as he was in some water. 10 stars. Watch the hilarious Gremlins 2",Null,1,3,23 February 2003
Sleepy Hollow," GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH ON HALLOWEEN
","This is a great movie to watch along with the Halloween movies around Halloween time.  The scenery in the movie is cloudy and gloomy; dead trees, leaves on the ground, no sounds of nature. The best part is when the horseman went in and out of the Tree Of Dead.  I just had to watch that in slow motion(I suggest you do the same). The only thing i didn't like is how you didn't really get to know the names of the characters because they didn't say their names that much and they got hacked to death. I also love when Icabod first comes into the house and Christina Ricci is blindfolded dancing around singing 'The Picatine Witch, The Picatine Witch, Whose got a kiss for the Picatine Witch.'  I could watch this movie over and over on gloomy days.  I gave this movie 10 stars out of 10.",10,0,1,30 April 2002
The Exorcist," The funniest movie i've ever seen.
","It's true. When the girl was finally possessed is when I started laughing. Can you blame me? Her head turns backwards, she cusses, does funny things with her tongue, barfs on the fathers. This was a really good movie except for the first 10 minutes where they were showing something about Iraq. Who cares about Iraq? I thought I was watching the wrong movie at first. How confusing it was. They should have taken that part out and put the spiderwalk in. I've never seen that part to this day. It sounds really cool. What's really cool is some people say I look like Linda Blair.",10,2,6,22 October 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," If I would have known the nut farm was so fun I would have had them drag me there when I had the chance.
","I really loved this movie.  It was so touching,sad,funny,and a little depressing. Of course what do you expect a group full of happy teens? I had two problems with this movie though. The first one is they make being in the nut farm a fun happy place to be. I mean come on, they didn't act to depressed to me.  Skipping medicine and going to the underground tunnels to a bowling alley? Come on, how many nut farms actually have a bowling alley? Then they sneak off to the doctor's office where one of the patients just happens to have a set of keys and look at their medical record. The second thing I didn't like was how we didn't find out what happened to the other patients? Did they tell you what happens in the book?  If they do please click on my name and leave me a message and let me know cause i am dieing to find out. This movie was so touching that I cried.  Winonna Ryder did such a good job as Susanna that i'm surprised that she didn't get an award.  Angelina Jolie did an excellent job playing a socialpath.  I loved how they showed her having really dry lips.  Good makeup job. I would definatly go see this movie if you haven't already.",10,0,1,22 March 2002
The Green Mile," One of Stephen King's Best book and movie a must see
",I loved watching the Green Mile. I just cried when they had to put John Coffee in 'Old Sparky'.  I always knew Stephen King was a good writer but this is one of his best even if it isn't a horror movie.  The book was so easy to read since it is almost like the movie with some added juicy details about when he was in the nursing home when he was older and one of the guys who worked there hated Paul and treated him like that jerk Percy.  The actors did a good job in the movie.  I can't believe he actually made a tear jerker movie.,10,0,1,4 November 2001
Bring It On," R'AH R'AH R'AH
","Bring It On is about a champ. cheerleading squad that finds out that their routines have been stolen from a Los. Angeles.  Taurance decides that they need a new routine when they go to state.  They hire Sparky (who kind of got on my nerves) and he gives them a routine that he gave out to everybody else.  They are forced to get a new routine to beat the clovers.i didn't care for the teeth brushing scene, thought it was kind of boring. I also didn't like the team name. Rancho Carne. sounds like something you would get at taco bell. I did like Kirsten and Eliza. very beautiful actresses.",10,0,0,3 July 2002
Halloween," The movie that started it all basically
","OMG, what a classic horror movie Halloween was, which basically started it all.  This movie is about the boogeyman aka Michael Meyers who butchers his sister when he was a little kid. Years later on the day before Halloween Dr. Loomis and a nurse goes to the mental hospital to pick Meyers up to take him to a different city for court.  When they get there they realize that a whole bunch of crazies are roaming around on the grounds unsupervised. While Dr. Loomis is out of the car on the phone talking to the hospital, Meyers gets on top of the car and attacks the nurse till she gets out and surrenders the car.  He then drives away in the car. The next day Dr. Loomis drives to Haddonfield which is Michael's hometown to try to stop the evil from killing.  Halloween day Laurie Strode keeps thinking she sees Michael Meyers but doesn't think anything about it.  Later on that night she is baby-sitting Tommy Doyle while her friend Annie (who's dad is a cop) baby-sat a girl, I forgot her name in the movie but her real name is Kyle, right across the street. Annie's boyfriend calls and wants her to pick him up so they can have sex so she takes the girl across the street so Laurie can watch them both and goes back to get into her car but realizes the car is locked. So she goes into the house and gets the keys and when she gets back to the car she just opens the door forgetting it was locked in the first place. She gets in the car and realizes that the windows are all fogged up. Michael Meyers pops up from the back seat and strangles her then slits her throat. Of course if she wasn't stupid enough to park in the back seat in the first place somebody would have heard her honking the horn. Later on the other friend played by P.J. Soles and her boyfriend comes to the house where Annie was sitting at and they go to the bedroom to have sex. After sex the boyfriend goes downstairs to get a beer.  Why he wasn't smart enough to turn on a light is beyond me.   There he encounters Michael Meyers where he gets impaled into the wall with a knife.  He then goes upstairs to kill the girlfriend by strangling her while she is on the phone talking to Laurie.  Laurie starts to get suspicious and scared so she tries calling back and gets no answer.  She then goes across the street to the house and there she discovers all her friends are dead. Michael Meyers then jumps out and attacks Laurie, who then falls down the stairs.  She breaks the back door to get out and screams for help with no avail. She runs back to the Doyle's house and gets into the house. Michael climbs through the window and hides behind the couch.  All you hear is his loud breathing through his white Halloween mask.  Laurie stabs him with a long sewing needle and thinks he is dead.   She runs upstairs and talks to the kids. Michael then comes upstairs so she has the kids lock themselves in the room and runs to the master bedroom. She opens the door that leads outside and then runs into the closet.  For all who wonder why she did that...would she be a responsible baby-sitter if she left the house with a killer inside and leave the kids alone? Don't think so. She hid in the closet and when Meyers started to chop the door down she grabs a hanger and stabs him with it. A little far fetched true but it got the job done.  She then goes to the kids and tells them to run out the Mackenzie's house and get some help. While the kids are outside screaming Michael sits up and gets up and walks to Laurie and attacks her again. Dr. Loomis notices the kids and runs into the house and shoot him till he falls out of the window.  When he runs out to see if he is dead or not guess what??? He's not there. He got up and walked away. A good classic recommended on Halloween night. But get the extended version.",10,1,1,15 June 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Best movie of the series
","I absolutely adored this movie.  It was scary, bloody, and it kept us all wanting more.  I loved when Johnny Depp was spending the night and he had to call his mom and lie saying he was at a relative's house when he wasn't so he put in a tape with sound effects.  After watching the first one though go right to the third one. I give this 10 stars out of 10 for the coming up with the brilliant idea of coming up with a killer who kills in people's dreams.",10,0,0,18 February 2002
The Birds," What do you expect with a 1963 movie?
",No really? it's not like they had computers and graphics back then. This was a really great movie for back then. It's about this lady Melanie(Tippi) who is going to deliver some love birds to some guy i forgot his name already sorry. When she gets to Bodega Bay she gets a welcome by a whole bunch of birds. I didn't really realize that there was no music until i read the comments here. so what if there is no music? It's different and better than having to listen to a song you don't like.  Instead you hear the birds cawing. I always thought the birds were real. I should have known that they were fake. How else would they have trained hundreds of birds.  It's not like they understand what you are saying. I could never get tired of watching this movie. I loved when the gas station exploded. So cool.,10,0,0,8 July 2002
Beetlejuice," all you have to do is say my name 3 times
","When this movie came out on tape, i watched it 3 times in a roll. that is how much i love this movie.  A married couple was in a car accident and died unexpectly.  When they return they don't know they are dead and spirits until they see some things(no hand in mirror, disapear for hours, can't leave house.) then some people move into the house and change just about everything, not to the dead couples standards.  They are unhappy so they try to get the people out themselves.  When that fails and get no help from Juno,their caseworker, they try to get beetlejuice to get them out. When that doesn't work Otho summons the dead and brings them back to life.  Lydia calls beetlejuice. The only way he can saved them if she says his name 3 times to get him out and for her to marry him.  All in all it's an excellent movie. Expecially the very in when Lydia dances. 10 stars.",10,1,2,7 July 2002
