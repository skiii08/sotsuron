Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie I have ever seen
","I was lucky enough to view an advance screening of this movie. Before attending the screening, I did a little background research. A lot of what I read about the movie pointed out that the movie was both extremely funny and controversial. Having seen the trailer, I thought of both statements as a little hyped up.They weren't. This was honestly the funniest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was funnier than every other comedy I have ever seen in my life (including the Borat interludes in the Ali G show) - old or recent - thoughtful or commercial. Consider this in light of the fact that I am not greatly amused with most comedies I watch - I might chuckle and laugh a bit at the Frat Pack flicks, and smile at the Woody Allen works. Here though, I was literally unable to stop laughing from the very beginning of the movie until the end, at which point, I had to hold back because my cheeks had become sore.Two of my other friends who came with me agree with me in that it was the funniest movie they have ever seen - although they knew nothing about Borat or Ali G before the screening. The audience in the theater was also enthusiastic - besides the constant laughter, there were several standing ovations.I somewhat debated giving this movie a 10 but I ended up doing so because I do not think I will ever see something as funny as this. Looking back, it was a unique experience and if you think you can get past the 'offense' you will probably agree with me as well as the thousands of others who watched and favorably rated the movie.",10,5,18,13 October 2006
Casino Royale," Good but not perfect.
","Among Bond films, Casino Royale is a refreshing sequel to the series. Daniel Craig is very smooth, very cool and very natural - there shouldn't be any concern about the transition between him and Pierce Brosnan. As for the action, in turn, it is somewhat reminiscent of Batman Begins in that it is real and possible but still impressive. All together, Bond's charm and abilities make quite the show and the movie is extremely thrilling in some parts and extremely smooth at others.That said, the movie did have its flaws and in all honesty, it does not deserve to be rated in the top 250. The story was somewhat undeveloped and the plot twists somewhat dull. There was also this whole misplaced love story bit that you probably won't believe if you know anything about Bond.",7,0,2,21 November 2006
