Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hands-down worst movie ever...
","I can't possibly describe how awful this movie is. Let's make a list:1. No main character, just a bunch of people no one cares about.2. Stupid story, without any logic at all, can't be comprehended.3. Childer who can't act and ask about angels.4. Completely different from any other Star Wars movie(logic suggests that if something is great, you don't try to change it...).5. Dissapearing fleet of donuts(that could be in No.2, actually).6. Star Wars used to be about saving the galaxy from an evil dictator, now it's about saving some Naboo people that we never see or care about from lack of food or something, dunno...Do you really want me to continue?",1,0,7,4 September 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I found it great...
","This is the greatest movie I've seen in months. Great story, great graphics and, generally, I got what I paid for(more Middle-Earth and Dragon scenes). There are random film snobs that will tell you that the movie 'sucks' while the book is 'great'. The truth is that it's the other way round. Peter Jackson accomplished making a really dark and interesting movie from a children's book. The story in the movie is much greater and more epic than in the book. And it's not the first time P.J. does that: remember the amazing fight between Gollum and Frodo ending with the destruction of the ring? You know what happened in the book? Gollum took the ring and amazed by it, it stumbled and FELL!!! I know that many grannies would prefer a movie with them sitting on a couch and reading the book for hours, but changes in the book do happen, much or little, and for a good reason. Accept that the story is better and move on with your life. Also, there are some sons of orks that will tell you that there is not 'character development'... What? Are you serious? We learn SO MUCH for characters that in the book we only know their name. Evil orcs, kind or fallen elves, people with families, corrupted people, dark-side of Thorin and so on, but I tried to omit the names to avoid spoilers... So, go see the movie, it's great, and don't listen to what others tell, trust only yourselves. You'll enjoy it!",10,2,8,23 December 2013
Frozen," Great, great movie!
","OK, so, I'm a big Disney fan and I've seen and loved all the classic Disney movies, but all of them just don't compare. The story is amazing and clever, with unexpected twists, the music is epic and believe me, those songs were the best I've heard in a Disney movie. There is a moral lesson, great characters and even technically, it's amazing. At last, a red head with freckles all over! Hey, Pixar, did Merida have freckles, while she should? Not to mention her potato-shaped head... Also, there were epic blizzards and magic powers to match Dragonball. Finally, you can get a glimpse of Rapunzel when they open the gates! Just watch carefully the bottom left corner... Finally, why are you still reading this? Go watch the movie!",10,4,13,1 March 2014
Schindler's List," Most shocking movie, and the most wonderful as well...
","There are no words able to describe this movie and where it excels. I could say about the amazing acting, the convincing environments etc. but again I wouldn't even touch the tip of the iceberg(did I get that expression right? I hope so...). It was the first 3 hour long movie that I didn't get bored not even a little(even in LOTR I get a bit tired after 2-3 hours!) and, even though 99.99% of it is in black and white, which at first seemed uncomfortable, when I saw the little girl with the red coat I almost broke into tears, even though I rarely cry even for my own misfortunes (after that, for some reason, the colors didn't bother me at all). Anyway, I don't want to start writing silly things a spoil this movie entirely so, to sum it up, watch it and I promise you, you won't regret it. Now, I'm sorry, I have to go. I'm gonna watch it one more time...",10,16,25,2 January 2014
Big Hero 6," Best animated movie of the year!
","I have to say that I have been watching the progression of this movie for a long time. Teasers, trailers, technical articles about the new technologies used etc. The expectations were great. And I have to say, the movie was worth the wait. Great animation, story, characters, humor, technologies that we might as well see in the near future... Even dark elements of anger and revenge that enrich the scenario. Generally, a great combination of everything that makes a good animated movie. People think that Pixar is the the king of the animation world, but Disney Animation Studios just keep proving that this is not the case. Instead of sequels and prequels, they actually make great, original and fun movies. If this one doesn't get any Oscars, I'll be disappointed for humanity. 10/10 , with no doubt!",10,56,102,8 November 2014
