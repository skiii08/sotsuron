The Hangover," Funniest movie I have ever seen, and I've seen them ALL
","This movie to me is not only the funniest movie I've seen so far in my life but also the BEST movie I have seen in 2009 so far. Todd Phillips (known also for directing Old School) delivers a smash hit that will stick in my mind for a very long time.The movie consists of many actors not very popular but they couldn't have picked better people to portray these Roles. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and the hilarious Zack Galifianakis are the best trio in any comedy movie I can remember. I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters and each time it felt like I had never seen it before because I was laughing out of my seat almost every scene. If you are having a bad day, watch this movie and you will laugh so hard you won't remember what a bad day is.",10,2,4,25 September 2009
Se7en," My favorite movie of all time for a number of different reasons
","Se7en is unlike any other movie I have seen before. This movie made me realize the genius of David Fincher. Each scene developed brings a different mindset to the audience because of the surreal art direction that gets into the psyche of the viewer. Each moment on screen gives you a feeling of what it is really like to be in the mind of someone who is insane. Andrew Kevin Walker writes a story that is daring, complex, and brilliant.The movie starts off with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman inspecting the first murder and the different personalities each detective has in the way they work. Brad Pitt's rebellious attitude and Morgan Freeman's old school antics is a great team of bold and brass. As each murder occurs, we can see the different reaction it has on the detectives and the way their stature is shaken by these events. Each different gruesome murder found increases the shock factor for the audience. To think that one man can do such manipulative and sadistic acts leaves the viewer stunned and wanting more. David Fincher couldn't have created a more suspenseful and elaborate plot to keep the audience on edge.While Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play their role to a T, the real star of the movie is yes SPOILER: John Doe himself as played by Kevin Spacey. The shear brilliance of this character is amazing and makes you uneasy with how intellectual and cunning he really is. The famous scene in which he gives himself up to the cops leaves you saying WHAT?! WHY?! and asking many other questions. While this is his first appearance on screen in the film, the presence of his character only gets better as the movie progresses.The second most famous scene to me has to the be the long monologue the two detectives and John have in the car ride on the way to the murder scene. This to me is one of the most memorable pieces of dialog in any movie i can remember. The genius of this scene is shown mostly in the ways Kevin Spacey answers the questions the detectives throw at him. Example when he questions Detective Mills about the fact that the people he murdered were innocent, actually leaves yourself questioning, Is John Doe really the evil one, or is society the devil itself? This was just a prelude to the most amazing ending to any movie I can remember.After the long car drive to the scene where John Doe is supposedly showing the detectives where the last two victims of his grand scheme are held, the unexpected hits you like a speeding bullet. In my opinion, I believe that the majority of the people who watched this movie think the last two victims were Mills and Somerset themselves and John Doe was just luring them to the be the final victims of his masterpiece. But David Fincher and company leave you with your jaw dropped and eyes wide open. As the scene progresses, a van is seen coming towards their direction. A man comes out saying he is supposed to deliver a box to a Detective Mills at this time. At this point I'm thinking what in the world could be in that box? Is it a bomb? But as Detective Somerset goes to investigate the box and John Doe says that he admires Detective Mills life, it all slowly starts to piece together.Once Doe mentions he admires him and his wife Tracy, everything starts to make sense. Once you find out Mills wife Tracy's head is in the box you are left speechless with eyes glued to the screen and cannot look away. John Doe's famous line, 'It seems that Envy is my sin' is one of the biggest twists in movie history. And finally telling Detective Mills, 'Become vengeance, Become wrath' is still one of the spookiest lines spoken on film to date. When Doe is shot and everything is over, you honestly have no idea how you feel. Its an assortment of feelings like amazement, sorrow, shock and disbelief. A great film is a film that you can watch over and over again and not get bored. This was one of those movies for me.This is by far my favorite movie off all time and if you watch this classic, maybe it will become a personal favorite of yours as well.",10,0,1,8 October 2009
Star Trek," One of the best films of 2009 so far and a great reboot to a fading trilogy
","When i first heard J.J Abrams was making a reboot to Star Trek i thought to myself oh boy another failure to restart a classic franchise. But was i wrong yet AGAIN in insuating a movie would be bad based on my little knowledge of the genius of Mr. Abrams. Star Trek is an exhilarating adrenaline rush of epic action sequences and visual effects that surpass any other Trekkie film of its kind. There are many haters out there on this movie stating it does not stay 'True' to the genre but i don't think they understand the concept of a REBOOT. A film in which you don't have to know anything about the series of Star Trek or any of its predecessors to enjoy. In my opinion many people belived this was going to be surpassed by other movies this summer, (Wolverine, Terminator) but this movie proved it is far better than any of those. A great recommendation for anyone looking to enjoy a great film.",9,1,9,4 June 2009
Coraline," Intriguing, good characters, but still missing something
","I was drawn to this movie due to the fact Henry Sellick directed it who brought us the timeless classic Nightmare Before Christmas. Coraline has many of the same elements Henry Sellick uses in his movies but it was still missing something to me to make it a great movie. Henry is a master at creating unique characters that amaze the audience. Coraline is no exception as the different characters and amazing scenery is what stuck out to me the most. The plot of the movie was also on point about a young girl escaping the real dismal world into a fantasy world where anything is possible. Many other aspects of the movie make it great as well like the amazing score and art direction but the pace of the movie is what slightly bothered me. Some scenes in the movie to me were drawn out too long and the point some of the characters were trying to make were halted for some unnecessary scenes. I guess with the many different characters in the film, there needs to be a lot of screen time to get their story across, but some scenes to me were not needed and dragged the film a little longer than it needed to be.But overall, Henry Sellick still proves he is a master of creating unique characters, stunning imagery and developing a great musical score to make any movie of his a must see. While Coraline has some flaws, it is still a good movie and a recommendation for anyone whose a fan of his work. 7/10",7,1,2,6 October 2009
"I Love You, Man"," slappa da bass!!
",I Love You Man delivers with its odd predicament about a man in search of a best man for his wedding. Something that very few men watching this movie would relate to which is why this movie is so hilarious. Paul Rudd has definitely proved he can be one of the funniest actors in any comedy and it doesn't just have to be people like Seth Rogen or Will Ferrel taking over the comedy world.I Love You man consists of hilarious one liners that will have you quoting the movie days after watching. Jason Segel is a great co-star to Paul Rudd and the two make a great comedic duo. The situations the two of them get into are awkward and so bizarre that you cant help but laugh at the scenarios. The thing I loved most about the movie were the many pop culture references and guest appearance by Lou Ferrigno. This movie also made me love Rush more than I already do. Go see and enjoy this movie for its many laughs,8,1,2,7 October 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Great film, with great action sequences but lacks some character development
","I saw this movie midnight opening and don't regret it at all. I can see why some people do not like this movie but from my perspective, i enjoyed it very much. Let me give my explanation without giving any spoilers....The people who didn't like this movie were probably die hard fans of the old comics with Deadpool, Agent Zero, and many of the other 'sub' characters. I am a big fan of X-Men and the franchise but not a die hard comic-con type fan, nor have i read the comics so i enjoyed this movie based on the action sequences and explanation of Wolverine's past which leads up to the X-Men series. Hugh Jackman was great as usual, and the explanation about his Weapon X transformation and relationship with all the other characters is very clear. Only problem i had with this movie was that it was about 50% Wolverine(obviously hence the title which is stupid for people to complain about that) 20% Sabertooth, 20% William Stryker and 10% every other character combined. I think the trailer gave snippets of every character, leaving the audience to believe OMG Gambit, The Blob, even Cyclops are in the movie!!! and they are in it for about 5-10 minutes and left some people disappointed. I was very hyped to see Gambit and Deadpool in the movie but their screen time was extremely limited. All in all, i thought it was a good movie, mostly because Hugh Jackman pulls off Wolverine flawlessly and the action sequences were better than any other movie i have seen in a while. So i recommend this to anyone who isn't looking for The Dark Knight type movie but more of a wildly action epic with a great explanation of Wolverines characters past",8,5,9,1 May 2009
Watchmen," Not my type of movie...
","Hearing about Watchmen I was very intrigued with the idea and the characters and scenery looked very good from what I saw in the trailer so I definitely was excited to check this one out. Being directed by Zack Snyder who I am a big fan of I had high expectations for this movie. But sadly I was left unsatisfied and drained.The best way I would describe this movie is like riding King-Da-Ka at six flags; at the very beginning you get all this adrenaline built up in you and just like that all the excitement is over. I think the weakness of this movie was probably all the different characters and how it tried to follow all the back stories of each character and in doing so made this movie boring to me. I know this movie is based on a famous graphic novel(which i have never read) so I did not know what to expect. The movie was 2 hours and 40 minutes and was probably the longest I've ever felt watching a movie in a long time. It honestly bored me to death and I didn't find the plot, characters, or many other sequences very interesting. This is just one person's opinion but like I always say, the only way to know if a movie is good or bad, go watch it yourself.",4,3,4,25 September 2009
District 9," An inventive and creative sci-fi story that redefines the genre
","I cannot remember another science fiction movie in a long time that made me leave the theater wanting more. District 9 takes the cliché concept of aliens on earth to something completely new that we have never seen before. The movie starts off kind of slow to let the audience take in the story of the aliens landing on earth, but after the story is explained, an epic adventure about the race of both humans and PRAWNS begins.In most movies about aliens, the plot consists of evil aliens landing on earth and then having a wild cat and mouse chase of aliens versus humans...NOT the case in this movie. For the first time Neil Blomkamp and Peter Jackson twist it around and make you feel what it is like to be on the alien side of the story and the emotions and struggles they have trying to cope with the human race on our planet. Almost every scene in which a human is abusing one of the PRAWNS, your heart sinks slightly and you cant help but feel sorry for them. The makers of this movie leave you with emotions of anticipation, depression and anxiety through each scene as it develops.Sharlto Copley, (unknown to me before this movie) plays his role perfectly as a once enemy to the alien race to a half turned ally towards them. His struggles through his transformation and escape is equally heart-felt as is the back-story to the prawns. The special effects and scenery were as good as any other science fiction movie i've seen in quite some time. If you are looking for a different and innovative movie about aliens and something you haven't seen before, i suggest you check this movie out right away. It is one of the best reviewed movies this year by far and i can see why. Do not miss your chance to see this classic",9,4,8,27 August 2009
Twilight," Good for lovers of the book, everyone else...not so much
","A movie like Twilight which of course is based on the highly acclaimed series of books by Stephanie Meyer, is a type of movie that will have a see-saw of different opinions. This movie had to be one of the most anticipated movies ever based on a series of books since the Harry Potter franchise. Teenage girls absolutely drooling over the fictional vampire hero Edward Cullen is a small taste of this pop-culture phenomenon. But enough about about the history lesson, the movie it self was mediocre. For those of you who say its a good movie JUST because you read the book and said it was amazing, then you have absolutely no say in a review about it. That is the biggest problem with this movie is that everyone is comparing it to the book when many who have seen the movie never heard of the series. For those who have read the book, including myself, i think its a great cast with the actors portraying the characters just as i had imagined them. I thought Kristen Stewart playing Bella was the best casting role they could have put in but of course, the acting was sub-par. One scene in particular i recall when Bella walks in front of the fan blowing her scent in front of Edward and then him covering his mouth pretty much summed up the acting quality of this movie. But all in all the movie followed the story of the book well and many of the other actors portrayed their character well. If you read the books, love the story i suggest you go see it. But if you have not or haven't even heard of the books by Stephanie Meyer, you'll probably get a feeling of what was the director of this movie thinking making this?? Average film at best.",1,0,2,4 June 2009
Taken," I've never seen one man whoop so much ass in one movie
","Taken is a great story about a man who will stop at nothing to get his kidnapped daughter back. Just rented this movie tonight and thought it was amazing. The story line is great and Liam Neeson is amazing portraying his character as a desperate father searching for his daughter. What intrigued me most about this movie is how well-developed the story line is and how after every scene it left me wanting more. Oh and of course, hence the title, Liam Neeson completely destroys anyone and everyone that comes his way. I was not expecting this much action when i first rented this movie but man was i surprised. This movie is action-packed, heart-pounding, emotional and all the aspects a good movie should have. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who just feels like watching a good movie. This is a must see",8,0,0,1 May 2009
Up," A heart-warming story with adventure, laughs and everything a great movie should be
","I saw this today with my friends and i wanted to watch Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell instead but my friends talked me into seeing this, and boy was i glad they did. Pixar has delivered some timeless classics like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. Finding Nemo, and the most recent Wall-E but this one has to be by far my favorite. Walking into the theater i was expecting a typical kids movie with a couple of laughs, crazy scenarios and funny characters but i got much MUCH more than that. The short film Party-cloudy couldn't have been a more appropriate warm up of what was to come in this movie because that short film had me tearing a little. The first 5 minutes of this story gave me such a nostalgic feeling of when i saw Bambi as a kid couldn't help but cry. The start of the movie had me moved with having Carl and his friend Ellie venture into the start of their lives and the close and unconditional love they shared for each-other. An amazing and almost too perfect couple put in a Disney film you think they could never have such a tragic event happen to this couple. But sadly, the animators of Pixar leave you bawling with this tear-jerker. The simple things about this intro really got to me like how they showed when they were kids and Ellie flew a balloon with a paper attached to it into Carl's room and Carl did the same thing to her when she was in the hospital. After his wife died, your heart sinks and you think to yourself how can i watch the rest of this movie after witnessing such a depressing moment? The scene afterwards with the bulldozers almost crushing his mailbox with their handprints on it and then wacking the guy in the head was almost hard to watch. But of course Pixar pulls it off again and takes the audience on a surreal adventure with great witticisms and characters. Russell's character was well portrayed and brought a lot of comedy and a great companion to Mr. Fredrickson. The dog 'Dug' brought a lot of great humor to the film and lines that had me laughing out of my chair at times. And the character of Charles Muntz, Carl's once childhood hero and now enemy was a great addition to the plot. All in all, this movie defines what real family movie is. It is literally for any age out there and you will enjoy it no matter where, when or who you are watching it with. A movie like Up will be frozen in the Pixar vault for a long time and other movies to come will have to be greatly designed to beat this classic. 10/10 easily",10,2,5,3 June 2009
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's greatest, and every other actor in this movie's greatest achievement
","Pulp- 'A soft moist shapeless mass of matter' Pulp Fiction- one of the greatest movies not just of the 90's but possibly all time and will not be surpassed by any of its genre for quite some time.This movie sparks the genius and creativity of Quentin Tarantino. A single masterpiece that gives you almost everything you could look for in Crime, Suspense and Drama. Each storyline that is thrown at you drags you in for a wild ride that leaves you wanting more with each scene and climax. Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary deliver the biggest set of characters in any other movie I could possibly remember. After learning that this movie only won one Academy Award for best screenplay I thought what a sham. Nothing against Forrest Gump at all but this movie blew me away with each scene as it developed and if this movie did not deserve best picture, no other movie did.The cast of this film is incredible with such A-list actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and many many other great performances. Each story drags you into the lives of each character and each is just intriguing as the next. Samuel Jackson is the star of this picture in my opinion because with each line of dialog he delivers keeps you in awe and amazement. This movie will stick in my mind for years to come and I'm sad I didn't embrace this epic earlier. Pulp Fiction is in every way a masterpiece, nothing else to say",10,1,2,4 October 2009
Zombieland," An unexpected hit
","Everyone rates movies differently but I rate a movie on how much I enjoyed the film and with that being said, Zombieland gets a 10/10 for me. This zombie action comedy flick sparkles with its hilarious twist on the idea of a zombie plague and hilarious cast. The idea of spoofing the classic zombie outrage was first introduced to us by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg in the hilarious Shaun of the Dead. The creators of this movie who were inspired by that classic deliver a movie that is as witty and hilarious as Shaun could be. The thing that amazed me most by Zombieland was the fact that it kept me interested and laughing out of my seat from beginning to end. Starting with the very first scene of the movie where Columbus is explaining his rules, pulls you in from there and you never look back. But the real star of the movie is of course Woodie Harrelson. Imagine his character from Natural Born Killers turn up the funny but instead for a knack of killing humans, its zombies. He pulls his role off flawlessly as the Zombie killing machine, Tallahassee, with a twinky fetish. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are great in their roles as well. Their characters show the love two siblings have for one another when everyone else in the world has vanished. The mixture of tough and bad ass action scenes, along with funny and sympathetic ones is greatly spread throughout this film. And lets not forget the great cameo by Bill Murray. This was just an extra bit the makers of this movie threw in their to make a great film even more exceptional.Zombieland is a great zombie action comedy that will remain as a favorite for a while. Go and see this and hopefully you will enjoy it as much I did.",8,2,6,6 October 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," One of those movies you're almost FORCED to like, and thats not a good thing....
","So i decided to give my review of this movie because it is in my opinion one of the most hyped most not just this summer, but probably this year. The Transformers phenomenon started in 2007 when Michael Bay introduced us to the famous Hasbro toy line come to the big screen. The first movie was a huge success and surpasses everyones expectations.....the sequel however, could not live up to the hype it was meant to be in my opinion. OK so let me start by saying i am the type of guy who doesn't mind a little mindless action and special effects blowing up every single minute, basically a good Michael Bay film. But i am also the type of person who looks for all aspects in a movie and Revenge of the Fallen is missing many of those aspects. I saw Revenge of the Fallen at the midnight showing and was excited and ready just like everyone else who went to see it. The first 5 minutes of this film automatically give you the tone the movie was going to give throughout, lots and lots of action and special effects. Hot cars, awesome fighting robots and big explosions. But of course, like many action packed movies, most of the focus is on the fighting sequences than the dialog or character development. Once the fighting robots and awesome cars clear the dust, we are introduced to the human stars of the movies. The first time we see Sam's eccentric mother already made me feel awkward about the humor in this movie. The writers seemed to put too many comedic punch lines in the movie when it was not needed AT ALL(i.e the 'weed' scene and Shia's sidekick Leo has many of those) And i am sorry Megan Fox, in my opinion you are the hottest woman in the world right now, but you still CANT ACT FOR YOUR LIFE!! Anyways, and of course i bring the topic of probably the biggest controversy in the entire movie, the introduction of the two new Twin robots in Skids and Mudflap. The writers seriously must have been smoking some serious stuff when deciding to portray these two characters in this manner because it almost ruined the film for me entirely. When i first here their voices, sounding ghetto and uneducated, i thought OK they wanted to add a little humor to the characters thats fine no biggy. But the ongoing ridiculous dialog and punchlines throughout the film was absolutely horrendous. Ex: talking about 'busting a cap in someone's ass' and admitting they are illiterate and cannot read. Oh yeah, and one of the robots even has a gold tooth which falls off in one of the action sequences. I think the movie would have been exactly the same, maybe even better if the characters were not introduced at all.Another major reason this film was slightly disappointing was The main villain, The Fallen. I say this because they should have just named the movie Transformers: Revenge of Megatron because The Fallen had absolutely NO IMPACT on the audience in the sense of how powerful a main villain should be. He didn't have an amazing presence, a resurrection or introduction to the film, he just seemed to be there and be like 'Hey look im the Fallen, and almighty god Decepticon that makes other Decepticons do my dirty work.' Megatron was still the main bad ass in this movie and the Fallen was just there to add more characters in my humble opinion. There were many other villains in the movie that i seemed to just forget about considering they were just added to only please the fan boys and more characters. In conclusion, the title of this post speaks for itself because in my case, going into one of the most hyped movies of the year at the midnight opening you are almost forced to like it considering the great action sequences and special effects. After reading this you may think i did not like this movie at all but not true. I loved the action and no one is better at blowing this up than Michael Bay but the aftermath of watching a big blockbuster film you will realize how simple the movie really is. The biggest thing to do in Hollywood in my opinion is to follow up a huge successful movie to an even better sequel and this movie proves that making it better is no easy task. I still recommend anyone who is a fan of the first one or even a fan of just good action to go see it but don't expect anything CLOSE to lets say a Dark Knight or anything Oscar worthy. Still think it will break many records at the box-office however.",6,1,5,27 June 2009
