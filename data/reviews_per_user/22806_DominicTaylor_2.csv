Black Swan," I absolutely loved Black Swan, one of the best, twisted, nightmarish films i have ever seen! Darren Aronofsky & Natalie Portman have done an amazing job.
","I saw a screening of Black Swan on Sunday, and i have to say that i loved every minute of it.The story is about a young ballet dancer called Nina (Portman) living in New York who has a lot of pressure on her by her mom, dance teacher (Cassel) and co-dancers. She is chosen to play the White Swan a pure innocent creature in the production Swan Lake, but must also play the dark, evil and sadistic sister the Black Swan. In real life Nina is sweet, quiet and innocent therefore the perfect role for the White Swan, so her dance teacher tells her to get in touch with her evil side so she can feel the Black Swan and make the performance much more realistic or she shall be replaced by co-dancer Lily (Kunis). But things turn very dark for Nina as she starts to suffer from hallucinations, paranoia and schizophrenia and becomes obsessed with 'perfection', and everyone around her and starts to go into a dark, mystical, seductive and evil place.When i read the story and saw the trailer to this film it just looked so twisted and awesome, not to mention all the awards it had one and i made it my top priority. So i went to the movies with high expectations and came out thinking 'what the hell have i just seen'. the reason i loved it so much was because it was innocent and bright at times and then all of a sudden turns dark and sadistic and goes back and forth. I have to say Darren Aronofsky has done a fantastic job and Natalie Portman was amazing.I am a huge fan of weird and twisted movies and this just blew me away honestly i cannot wait till this comes out on DVD, one of my new favourite films ever.",10,0,2,1 March 2011
The Wrestler," an absolute knockout!
","i had quite high expectations of The Wrestler with all the great reviews it got and have to say i wasn't disappointed one bit. The story is great, the wrestling is awesome & the overall outlook is memorable. Mickey Rourke's performance was brilliant. He really stepped up his game for this movie and gave an exceptional performance as the wrestler. Darren Aronofsky did an amazing job with this film. Without a doubt one his best finest he's made. the wrestling matches were awesome. They weren't amateur or poorly acted, instead they made you feel like you were watching a professional wrestling match.The depressing yet entertaining storyline kept you intrigued the whole movie and was admirable. One of the things I loved about this movie was it's originality. It was a bit of a risk this film because it's not everyones idea of a great film and obviously wrestling isn't everyones favourite thing in the world. However Darren Aronofsky & Mickey Rourke defiantly pulled it off and made you love every minute of the film, whether you like wrestling or not.the whole idea of an ageing wrestler who is at the peak of his career and try's to fix everything he messed up in his family life in order to live his dream is memorable and i can't find a fault in the story. overall i would have to say this was a truly great film. All the performances were exceptional, the directing was inspiring & the story was awesome! AN INSTANT CLASSIC.",9,0,1,14 May 2011
