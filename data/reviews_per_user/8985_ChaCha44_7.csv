Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Love the film but really love the HBO series more
","Don't get me wrong. I love this movie and will see it another 2 or 3 times before it comes out on DVD. Just thinking about certain segments and lines from the film have made me laugh out loud. That being said, I feel all the praise and buzz about this film should really be devoted to the HBO Da Ali G Show which is superior to this film, great as it is. As a long time fan of Mr. Cohen's, I'm glad to see him get the recognition he deserves as well as happy that those who didn't follow his HBO show have their first exposure to this genius but again, I think his HBO series is superior to the film.In the HBO series,watching Borat go house hunting or canvassing for votes with a mid-western Republican party candidate are among some of the most tear inducing and choking from laughter experiences I've ever had in front of the TV screen.",9,1,7,7 November 2006
Juno," Any TV Movie on Teen Pregnancy - All are better than Juno
","Update: This is the first time I have ever done this and I hope I am able to do it. I want to apologize for blasting this film. After another viewing, I started to fall in love with this little charmer. Now after several more viewings, I am totally in love with this movie from its folksy little songs that at first seem silly but are oh so perfectly fitting to brilliant performances to a story that at first seems mundane but becoming a lot deeper than you realize. Juno you are a wonderful film, sorry it took me so long to come around.**************************************************************For starters I didn't hate Juno. I thought Ellen Page was charming (though I agree with so many others in that her character could be annoying and pretentious). I also liked the rest of the cast. However, The story line of teen pregnancy is an old one. We've all seen countless movies on the subject matter so if you are going to make a film on this subject, you need to bring something new to the table which this film clearly didn't do.If this was just some throwaway indie film, I would have walked away from this thinking, okay, it was cute but when you hear buzz about how great this is and then HBO gives it 3.5 stars (which is the same rating they give The Color Purple), there are expectations that this film is special; it isn't. Could it have been more than it was? I don't think so. If you are reading this review and want to watch this film go into it not expecting anything great. Maybe if my expectations weren't so high, I would have given it another star, who knows?",3,0,4,18 January 2009
Closer," Haunting
","I love films that haunt, and this one certainly does. We have the writer, the dermatologist, the photographer and the ex-stripper (now coffee house server), four characters who are entwined in each others lives by couplings that are traditional and not so traditional.There isn't too much of a plot but there doesn't need to be; it's all about some very honest dialog and emotions. It puts you in a 'What would you do in this situation mode', forcing you to react and think as these people. The acting was superb and you have a hard time forgetting that this is just a film and not a reality show of these four people.Speaking for myself, I was deeply moved. The opening song was so beautiful and gripping. I don't have many soundtracks in my music collection, but this one I must have. It was definitely worth seeing but those people who don't want to feel too deeply should probably avoid since it will be wasted on them.",Null,0,0,9 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Disappointing
","If one more person comments how this is how the Harry Potter films are supposed to be, I'm going to barf up slugs.This long awaited film proved to be a major disappointment in many ways. It's not so much that the students didn't wear robes or that there is a new Dumbledore but it just feels as if Dementors sucked the very soul out of this movie. I'm well aware that movies cannot include every little detail that the book contains but I agree with so many others in that much of the essence of HP3 is supposed to be about the strong bond of friendship between Mooney, Wormtail, Prongs and Padfoot. To bypass any explanation of the significance of the map and it's authors is seriously derelict.A unique aspect of HP3 is that so many millions have read the books and it's with a very critical eye that we watch this 3rd installment. You can't just go and change the sets that we've come to know and love. On it's own, it's not a terrible movie. It certainly held my interest, good casting, some funny lines, great intro...but you just get the feeling there is no warmth or soul to this movie. I can sit and watch HP1 and HP2 another dozen times while this one I've watched three times trying to like it, but couldn't . It's like going for a steak dinner and winding up with hamburger. Be prepared to walk away from this one saying 'huh?'.",Null,0,0,10 June 2004
The Exorcist," Real, True Horror
","If you don't know by now what The Exorcist is all about, please skip to another review because this one isn't going to give you a synopsis nor is it going to speak of great performances.What I will share with you is how utterly scary this movie is. Teenagers and others who might think they are immune to this film because they have seen 'Bloody Ax Murders Who Know What Jason Did Last Summer' type horror movies should not dismiss this as just another horror flick. To this day, I occasionally have nightmares of Linda Blair's possessed face while 'Tubular Bells' chimes in the background. It's a nightmare that I am always grateful to wake from.I know that I could not even in broad daylight watch this movie without shielding my eyes or muting the sound of the demon as he speaks through the 12 year old girl with eyes that are the windows of hell.If I had it to do over again, I probably would never have watched this film. It honestly is terrifying and I've never seen anthing that has come close.",Null,1,2,9 November 2005
Mamma Mia!," Not Enjoyable On Any Level
","When this movie came out, it looked so appealing in the trailers. I never got around to seeing it and just recently heard that Mama Mia is breaking all kinds of records in the UK so figured it was time to give it a shot. What a waste of my time. I hated this boring turkey with a passion. Why? I liked the actors. I love ABBA music and I like beautiful scenery. With all these positives, why did I hate this movie so much? If the singing was passable, I could have found something positive to say about it but it really was mediocre. This was so boring and didn't work on any level. Amanda Seyfried was pretty good which is about the only nice thing I can say. Maybe I would have enjoyed the Broadway play more but as movies go, this one stinks. It really and truly does.",1,12,19,30 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," To be Oohed and Ahhed Over
","Hoorah! The best of the lot. For all you Harry Potter fans out there, readers of the series and non-readers alike, this is the absolute best Harry Potter movie. This new film comes to me as renewed faith in the Harry Potter series after what I considered a horrible turn by Alfonso Cuaron in Prisoner of Askaban. I know fans were divided on 'POA' and I was definitely in the 'hated it' camp with the reason being how many important elements were left out, and not just nitpicking little items but key ingredients. Enough reviewers here have told you about the plot and my, my how the kids have grown but what I would like to add is that this latest Harry Potter film really captures the humor of the books. JK Rowling's humor is one of the key ingredients to the success of Harry Potter and it's nice to see it fully demonstrated here. This is a truly wonderful film. Can't bless it enough!",10,1,3,6 December 2005
