Blade Runner 2049," Excellent film that will become a SciFi classic
","I enjoyed this film hugely. I watched it in IMAX 3D and it was great to have a big screen, however, I feel like REAL 3D might have been better, despite the smaller screen, because then you can tilt your head without the film coming out of focus or showing its two images. This isn't Blade Runner 2049's fault though, this is a fault of the 3D technology. If it's possible you should definitely watch the previous Blade Runner film and the shorts created by the Director's friends before you watch this movie. However, I understand that the trailer has spoilers in it and therefore you shouldn't watch that. I think I might have been a bit lost though if I had not watched the previous film so recently.The movie has an excellent plot. I had resigned myself to the obvious when Gosling thinks he is the born replicant but I was pleasantly surprised when the twist comes and he is not. I can't say I've loved Gosling's acting in the past (e.g. Drive or La La Land) but in this film he is fantastic. He mostly acts with breathing and facial expressions and you know exactly what he is thinking and feeling at all times.The special effects are astonishing, especially in 3D. It's not overused and the movie keeps all the tropes from the original but builds and improves upon them. The seduction scene (obviously CGI-ed to the maximum) is quite frankly staggeringly beautiful. I could not take my eyes off the screen. And, like the original, this film didn't feel the need to shove 'sex, sex, sex' in our faces.Harrison Ford still packs a punch (quite literally) but he is not overly present so it's not a 'Ford mobile', which is good. Also, I was pleasantly surprised that he has not gone down the Sean Bean route and decided to die in all of his films. I am not sure what I thought of Jared Leto, I couldn't really understand what his dialogue meant as he speaks in riddles. I know that he is meant to be the crazy technology overlord and his motivation is to find a way to get the replicants to produce offspring but his script is too abstract to understand. Slyvia Hoeks is impressive as Luv. I expected her to be a Rachel like character but she quickly and believably turns violent, obviously on the orders of Wallace, and plays psychopathic replicant without regret very easily. A complex character made very interesting and acted well. You feel genuine sadness for K as he realises that his treasured hologram whose personality we are led to believe is individual is actually not so replaceable. I thought the scene with the giant hologram prior to him dying for a different and more important cause added to the plot very well.Overall this is an absolutely fantastic film, well worth the preparation of watching the previous film and the shorts and the money and travel to get a 3D experience.",9,1,6,9 October 2017
Doctor Strange," Escapist fun but cynical prequel plot
","I did enjoy this movie. As with all the Marvel movies, the special effects were excellent and the premise was novel and engaging. I was disappointed by the lack of humour that is so prominent in those other films of the Superhero genre (e.g. Iron Man). In that way, it felt more like a DC movie than a Marvel. The attempt at humour with Wong near the end was poor in the extreme. Although, I did laugh at the cloak pulling Doctor Strange about.Chiwetel Ejiofor is an amazing actor and brings his own special magic to any role he plays. I especially liked him at the end when he changes to bad and I look forward to watching him in the next instalment. Tilda Swinton was a bold and interesting choice as the Ancient One. This is a complex character, especially when one is never quite sure what side she's on. She looks pretty scary bald.Benedict Cumberbatch is another matter for me. He is fantastic in Sherlock and it suits his acting skills down to a tee. However, in Doctor Strange I found his accent annoying and his performance somewhat overacted or underacted at most times.My main criticism of the film is the cynical prequel plot. It's a half film in the rolling, money making juggernaut of Marvel. It felt to me like they got part way through, ran out of ideas and thought they'd release it anyway because people will always eat it up if it has the Marvel name. He solves the end problem so easily - 'Oh I'll just loop time' - woo hoo, the Dormammu followers are gone, the big scary demon (that the Ancient One has apparently fought for hundreds of years) is gone. Yes it was a clever ending but disappointing too. Overall, if I had paid to go to the cinema to see this I would have walked out unsatisfied.",5,0,0,5 October 2017
Ex Machina," Tense little thriller, well chosen cast.
","When Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) and Nathan (Oscar Isaac) meet each other for the first time the atmosphere is uncomfortable at best and disturbing at worst. The actors and script manage to keep this going throughout the film, making for a tense and awkward feeling throughout.I haven't seen any of the actors in any other films so I was impressed by them all. Oscar Isaac flips from friendly, to cruel, to intimidating, to downright scary, to manic very easily. Domhnall Gleeson has obviously picked up his father's flair for acting. His Caleb is scared, nervous and excited all at the same time and his ultimate innocence, misinterpretation and betrayal is sad to watch.Ava (Alicia Vikander) moves beautifully as the android, almost like a ballet dancer. Her childlike innocence is endearing but still surprisingly spooky and disturbing. Also, the special effects are exquisite: from top to bottom she looks every bit the android.The script is well written but the parts about A.I. mainly repeat the old and often used clich√©s, which is disappointing. I recently saw Blade Runner 2049 where they chose not to go through lengthy monologues on A.I. and I thought this was a good decision. The scene where she asks him 'how do I look?' (when she is wearing the dress and then he watches her take it off) reminded me much of The Graduate and I was almost disappointed when he didn't reply 'very good'.The soundtrack is really interesting. It is often not present at all, which is a great choice and adds to the film's eerie suspense. When it does play it is well used.About two thirds of the way through I started to get disappointed as I had guessed all the small twists and turns from really early on. However, I didn't see the multi-twist at the end coming. Nathan is wrong when he says that the main aim in life is to reproduce, the main aim in life here is to survive.",7,1,3,18 October 2017
Blade Runner," A SciFi classic - more for the aesthetic than the plot...
","We watched the 'Final Cut'. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It was also great to watch a film which, unlike modern films (I hear Bladerunner 2049 is 2.5 hours long), didn't feel the need to turn into a bum numbing epic!The special effects were excellent despite this film being from 1982. As with others of the genre (Alien, Aliens), I think animation special effects were just hitting the top of the curve prior to digital effects taking over. Interestingly the quality of the special effects mean that this film does not look dated, just like Alien and Aliens. All the scifi tropes were here (hover cars, evil tech overlord, sky scrapers with giant advertising, awesome synth soundtrack, odd futuristic clothing, the nerdy tech guy...) but the difference is that this film almost invented them inspiring many later films. The cars look quite outdated compared to cars nowadays, which made me laugh, especially as the film is set in 2019 and we're nowhere near that technology. The soundtrack is almost hypnotic, especially when Deckard is walking the streets, for example the 'cross, don't cross' sign. Ford plays his role fantastically - he is best as the embittered rebel with a sense of humour. Rutger Hauer munches the scenery as always but maybe when you're playing a psychotic replicant who has stolen a ship to find your maker and extend your life then it's allowed. I felt genuinely sad for Rachel as she works through realising she is a replicant, her memories are implanted and her lifetime is limited. Although, the seduction scene made me slightly uncomfortable as it feels a little bit too on the non-consensual side. I had to look away when Roy crushes Tyrell's skull and presses in his eyes - that crunch is nasty.It's also interesting to read that Ford and Scott could never agree whether Deckard is a replicant. His dream sequence with the unicorn and his fellow blade runner making a unicorn out of paper seems to imply that his dreams may be implanted. Also, I had not before noticed the significance of him not answering Rachel's question about him having taken the test. Though it seems if Blade Runner 2049 is set 30 years after the original then Deckard must be human or he would have expired....This film does not have an overly complex plot but is a masterpiece nonetheless. I first watched it 20 years ago and it was every minute as good as I remembered.",9,1,2,7 October 2017
