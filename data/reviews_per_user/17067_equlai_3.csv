The Blair Witch Project," Fear to be experienced
","I knew nothing of this film going into it save for what I had read on the posters.  Luckily, I was extremely impressed but also extremely spooked by it.It wasn't meant to scare but to terrify.  The true embodiment of fear comes from within when the imagination is left to run wild as it does in the 3 characters of the film.  It wasn't meant to make you scream, it wasn't meant to make you jump, it was meant to make you think and use your imagination. Your imagination is more powerful than any cinematic effect that they could have possibly used.Other reviews said this film was a disappointment, they were waiting for the final punch.  I was more disappointed with The Haunting (yes, I did see it). I liked this film a lot and impressed with the fact that for something as low budget as this is, it can still do as well as it has.Do yourself a favor and go see this film.",10,1,2,4 August 1999
12 Monkeys," incredible storyline...
","I was rather impressed with this film after viewing it.  I liked the way Gilliam balanced the surreality of the future with the elegance of the visual effects to produce a rather engaging mix.  All other compliments aside however, I thought the ending was a bit ... different.  To put it bluntly, I didn't like the ending.  Granted, I don't know what Gilliam was thinking when he did the ending or the feeling he was searching for, but my take on the ending would have delved more into the realm of unending circularity.Aside from this small portion, I highly recommend this film.",Null,0,0,24 March 1999
The Sixth Sense," incredible...
","When I first saw trailers for this film, I was intrigued to say the least. But after seeing The Haunting, was a little worried with how this film would fare.I can say that I was very happily impressed.  Acting, music, script, mood, setting... I've never been so truly engrossed in a movie before.People cannot compare this film to The Blair Witch Project.  Even though they share the 'scare' or 'horror' genre, they do operate on different levels.At times, the film did drag and there was a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that this would end as horribly as The Haunting.  I was once again happily proved wrong.This film is definitely worth the money.",9,0,0,8 August 1999
