Iron Man 3," Wow this was bad
","I wonder who is putting these numbers up on this movie....a 7.9 it is not. Maybe a 5 at the most.This movie is terrible. You walk out going wait, what...? They really just let this one go. Almost like someone had a bunch of ideas about the movie, shot each scene separate, then filled with bad jokes and CGI.Not sure who out of the whole Marvel franchise would have let this go to screen without stepping up and saying it was horrible.4-5 decent scenes, wait for it to come out to your local Wal-Mart bin for $10",3,6,14,3 May 2013
