Conquest 1453," Excellent for Turkish Cinema
","I think the movie is very successful.It's the most expensive movie in Turkish cinema. Cast selection, visual effects, sword scenes are very successful. People criticize movie about historic mistakes.Director focused on Ulubatli Hasan.Some of critics said this is copy paste of Hollywood movies like Troy,The Lord of The Rings and Braveheart. On the other hand the budget seems too high in Turkey. Otherwise $17,000,000 is not high for Hollywood's historic production. This is the success of the director. Faruk Aksoy tried to his best. Fetih 1453 is a milestone for Turkish Movies. The success of this movie will encourage movie producers and directors in Turkey.After then we can see Turkish movies in Top 250.",6,54,120,19 February 2012
