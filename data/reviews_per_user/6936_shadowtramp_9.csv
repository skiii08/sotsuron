Minority Report," The first class compilation
","Yes. It is a compilation of many Sci-Fi films and books. Yes. It's a first class one. Hard earned B mark. Thorough made industrial film. I may say that on the road to home we discussed this cine. I compared it to Matrix, Solaris (after Lem's outstanding writing filmed by Tarkovskii) and couple more. In my opinion Minority Report looses to all primary ones. But tell me: how many films made today are worth of such comparison? I definitely won't go second time. But i definitely recommend to see it once. It would be better to see it in good cinema.",8,0,0,17 September 2002
Ready Player One," Not sure, who is the target auditory
","The main problem is the absence of anything substantial in this movie I want and can remember. Ask me what was it about two hours past the final titles, and I'm already having troubles remembering.
This movie may go well for some teenagers, with its school level romance. But it refers, and practically adores, so many things from past, so that it will hard to imagine teenager who cares about all those references.
There are few good moments in this movie. Hence the 4/10. But overall impression is very depressing.",4,6,15,2 April 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Do not recommend
","My problems are mainly three.1. This movie is like good old pron with the story: 'main characters' do some talks and pull some faces just to walk to another room and do their 'job' there. In MI5 main characters mostly do the same. All the clever talks and all the clever plot is just a mean to link action scenes.2. You may say, that it was always the same with MI series. Well, almost. This time actors do not play at all, except for Pegg. Simon Pegg is the only main actor who performs and does his job great. Cruise just pull one of the two faces. One being of knowing smile, the other - of great worry. And both suck.3. One could probably enjoy MI5 as much, as, say, F&F series. But the action scenes aren't great either. If you have seen trailer, you've seen the best one. The problem with the action scenes is that all of them end stupid.I will not do nitpicking about plausibility of stunts. But this time MI came close to being comics screen adaptation. And that's bad. Not here, not there.Don't waste your time and money.",5,18,36,3 August 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," CGI kills it
",This movie lasts 169 minutes. About half of this time is wasted for some annoying computer generated 3D images. 10 or 20 minutes more are left for stunning views of mountains. Which I actually liked a lot. And the rest is beautiful.The first thing one should understand this movie is not a rendition of the book ¨Hobbit¨. It is a kind of prequel to Lord of the Rings trilogy made by Peter Jackson that is loosely based on the book.And this prequel is just great. All the key moments are made to the greatest standards. My only rant is about tree-hanging scene which suffer from the same ailment as the rest of the movie - it is made to last way too long.And this brings me back to my vote. I vote 5 since only half of this movie worth watching. And it is better by far to watch it home where you can skip this irrelevant CGI.,5,12,25,22 December 2012
Arrival," Had excellent aftertaste
","This movie has few shortcomings: it has some inconsistencies in story line and some actors do not live up to the exceptional performance of the leading actress. And this is it.The rest will keep your attention during and well after the show. It is a rare gem of though provoking art, that is telling the story exceptionally, accompanies the story with beautiful and non intrusive visuals.And, finally, this science fiction concentrates on humans, and not on extra terrestrial gizmos. It concentrates on painting the picture of humans. And excels in it.",9,3,10,14 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Just emotions - if someone need more comments
",First of all: this film is one of the 'must see'.It's not just a collection of perfect moments. It's not just a work of good teammates. It's a single moment from the start till the begining when you live along with the characters of the film.And the last but not the least: it very hard to make film after strong book. Different seasons is worth reading and definitely very impressive. When I watched the start I honestly doubted that it will impress me that strong.,9,0,0,29 October 2002
Looper," It is well worth seeing
","Actually this movie is rather good. It could have higher marks and more exciting reviews. But it doesn't.It is not '12 monkeys', or 'Die Hard'. It will not start new genre. And most probably you will not buy it to add to home collection.For one time movie this one has all it needs: it has it's fun moments, and really sad ones. Willis and Gordon-Levitt do perform quite well. And supporting cast is great.What I mostly disliked were other two key characters. That you will not see in trailers. And I really didn't like the final.But you may disagree after watching. So I emphasize it once more: this movie is well worth seeing.",8,0,10,30 September 2012
Heat," Enthralling
","It is amazing how this masterpiece enthrall me more and more with the passing of time! Ihis one is among those rare movies you may watch once every year or so. And each time you will fill more like knowing characters personally. I even caught myself thinking once that I changed my attitude toward Neil. That I fill he is more villain and bad then I thought at first. I feel more for Vincent with the time. It is astonishing how romance evaporates from the characters of bandits with each scene. And there are not many movies I saw that had such strong and appealing characters in them. If you are looking for the title to add to your collection, one you may want to watch again, give this one a try.",10,2,4,15 August 2005
Mad Max: Fury Road," Not much madness
","Unfortunately the main part of Mad Max is absent. There is no main male character. There is no Mad Max in this picture. And the necessary component is really missing.I remember Mel Gibson eyes speaking of his character madness. I remember quite a few quotes from the original series. I will forget the most of the Fury Road very soon.The rest of the characters is denied good development either. Original series was about characters. The scripts were about characters.That said, I must explain why I gave this part such a high vote (7). The action part of the movie is really great. In a perversive way it is like Monster Track madness feat Cirque Du Soleil. Sometimes script gets in the way of this exemplary road action. But don't worry. It doesn't take much time.",7,7,16,18 May 2015
