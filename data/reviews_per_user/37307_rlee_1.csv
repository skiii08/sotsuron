The Blair Witch Project," incredible concept...
","The Haxan Five deserves a huge pat on the collective back for developing such an incredible concept for a film in 1999, when every other idea has been attempted.  This project was truly unique.  I only wish I hadn't read so many spoilers on their websites, which are equally commendable.  It would be unfair of me to critique their accomplishment after learning so much of the plot before I watched the film.  Thanks, Ed and Dan, for making yourselves so accessible to your adoring public, which multiplies in number every day, and will surely continue to do so in the summer ahead.",8,1,2,26 May 1999
