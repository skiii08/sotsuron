E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Extra Terrestrial
","An excellent movie for all ages with a timeless innocent story that will transcend anyone into an emotional attachment to the ET. The ET is so lifelike, lovable, and good hearted. you cannot help but to fall in love with him. I was 13 when the movie came out and I did not remember a lot of the scenes. This movie is much better than most movies out today. My hat is off to the actors and Steven Spielberg. The new effects appear to make the movie even better.I recommend the DVD that comes with both versions, the original and the computer enhanced version. It also comes with extras such as interviews with the cast, a 20th year reunion of the cast, etc.",10,1,2,7 September 2005
