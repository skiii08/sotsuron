Alien 3," Perfect Ending(pretend Ressurection never happened)
","I personally think Alien 3 is the perfect ending to the trilogy. It may not have thrills and chills like Alien, or the crazed gun-toting marines from Aliens(or the crappy story of Ressurection), but it does have dramatic value, and likable characters. 8/10",8,1,3,9 March 2002
