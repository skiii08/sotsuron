Blade Runner 2049," Better than the original. Great film.
","I am finally writing a review on this even though I saw it a few months ago. I watched it 3 times. Very well done and pretty cosmic.The original film was good but I always am surprised when people call it the greatest sci fi. I think that kind of praise is misguided.I enjoyed this film and I'm sure I'll wait a while and watch it again. I appreciated the look, design and cinematography. Pretty perfect film.",10,0,10,5 June 2018
Hereditary," Where is the 3 hour Director's Cut? Ghastly, profane, unrealized with existing cut.
","Very gross film. The kind of horror movie that should be sealed in cement or burnt in a fireplace......On the other hand, as a horror film that takes you by surprise---for it's complexity, not traditional scares--- it needs the 3hour director's cut, to be fully fleshed out.The acting is extraordinary, the film's technical style is excellent. The abbreviated resolution of the film is going to fail for most viewers because of the scenes clearly cut out of a longer, more detailed version.This film makes me wonder about the Motives for telling this nightmare story. Very cultish, scary, dark and disturbing. Do they hold secret rituals in real life? Creeped out and profane, but left to much backstory unrealized in 2 hours and 7 minutes. So bring on a Durevtor's cut.
Toni Colette is good in everything and here she goes full tilt bonkers.",9,29,56,3 September 2018
Unbreakable," Took a few times watching to appreciate
","This movie is M Night Shyamalan's best film. And after seeing it again tonight, my opinion is reinforced. it really needs a sequel! Or more than one.I've liked a few other Shyamalan's film, but this one sticks with me, more than the rest. I love the pace...and the music.",10,3,6,30 May 2018
Yesterday," Pleasant Love Story with great singing and songs. Fun and mystical.
","Both stars are terrific. Wonderful little movie that should have been a 3 hour love fest, but great as it is.Where do these lyrics come from? Did the Beatles also receive these lyrics from some cosmic memory?Some great surprises and nostalgia, with a mysterious twist.",10,0,1,28 September 2019
A Quiet Place," Darn thing needs a Prequel and a Sequel
","Aggravating 'edge of the seat,' brief glimpse of what could be a very large, epic alien, invasion story. This film is like a trailer of that story.Definately kept my attention, but the film left me annoyed that it was so limited in scope.If this was a series, this could be episode 1. Pretty scary, but leave a huge gap.",8,1,2,14 July 2018
Moulin Rouge!," The duets are awesome-always tears me up
","I saw this in the theater when it was released and saw it again. When the disc came out I watch it a few more times. Now they been showing it alot on cable and I keep watching it.Besides the amazing cgi and riveting special effects, the energy of the whole production and the radical arrangements of pop classics, the colors and movement, Nicole Kidman and Ewen McGregor have incredible chemistry and their duets are mind blowing, soaring and tender.",10,0,0,28 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Too noisy, CGI mess, Not enough characterization
",They made sure we would hate it. . Had forced charm. The 1992 TV movies was better.Way to much noise and crazy action instead of characterization.Disappointing.,7,1,1,14 December 2019
Mother!," Dr Suess - Thidwick the Big Hearted Moose Mother!
","This is ridiculous. 30 minutes into it and all I can think of is Dr Suess, the Big Hearted Moose that allowed all these vile creatures live in his antlers, till he died and had + + crosses in his eyes stuffed on a wall on the last page. Edit: I reread the story and I had forgotten the ending. Actually it had a good ending. It wasn't Thidwick who died and was stuffed. It was the antlers only and all its, vile, selfish creatures that were dead with the crosses in their eyes. I wish, Mother! Had a good ending like that. No wonder that some people were protesting Dr Suess, it's like refugees destroying countries offend the people who want to destroy the culture and happiness of countries.And all I can think of watching this is how I used to think Jennifer Lawrence was smarter then most of the young actresses in Hollywood. Now with her terrible political ravings how could I like this sick movie? The haters of Make America Great Again are like Thidwick the Moose's antler invaders! Poor Lionheart England. Poor France and other countries in Europe as the globalist wackos cause their countries to be invaded...just like the crazy people taking over the house in this film. Just open the door and let them all in.Shameful Jennifer Lawrence. Art imitates life. Is Aronfsky nuts now too?Would I still like Rosemary Baby if Mia Farrow and Roman Polanski are satan worshippers in real life? Blood drinkers?Can't they see what this movie is about? Poor Thidwick. How stupid he was.'GET OUT OF MY HOUSE YOU NUTS. NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.'GO DRINK BLOOD SOMEWHERE ELSE! Wake up Jennifer you are in with a bad crowd. Jennifer you are in with a bad crowd.",10,0,3,25 December 2017
Creed II," Not bad but needed more character involvement all around.
",We learn little about Rockys current life. It was unfortunately just a walk through part for Stallone. Could have had much more drama and real life. Everyone was good but not enough character development.,6,1,1,10 March 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Ultimate Extended Edition---Fantastic Masterpiece
","I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the 'Extended Edition ' on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a 'fan boy' of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a clich√© type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes.",8,278,433,16 July 2016
Warcraft," Absolutely incredible, first taste of a Warcraft series of films
","This review is for the regular version, not .3D or IMAX.I didn't expect the Warcraft film to be this excellent. It s magnificent. It must be hard for those not familiar with the stories and characters to follow this though. In many ways the Warcraft 'lore,' is far more complicated then 'Lord of the Rings.' Because the Warcraft stories are so sprawling and each aspect if the story requires minutia details, this film is just a tiny tip of the iceberg. I hope it makes a fortune at the Box Office, to ensure many more films to come.I saw the midnight show last night in Hollywood during the first giant battle scene, there was a large earthquake in Anza Borego in CA. The earthquake was thundering along with the Orc and Human armies. It was surreal.Technically the film excels. My only complaint would be that I'd prefer more wide screen long shots. The film is mostly closeups. Back that camera up more for wider panoramas.A 10! See it a few times while it's in the theaters.",10,3,6,10 June 2016
