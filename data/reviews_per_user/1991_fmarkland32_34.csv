Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Love hurts...
","Uma Thurman returns as the Bride, who this time looks to continue her streak of vengeance against Budd(Michael Madsen), Ellie Driver(Daryl Hannah) and Bill(David Carradine) the movie delivers more substance than the predecessor and is better due to the texture provided by character actors who perform their roles excellently. I liked Kill Bill:Volume 2 better than Volume 1, mainly due to the attention given the relationship between Carradine and Thurman, which overall makes the ending tragic. David Carradine has always been an underrated talent and although he made a lot of lame B. movies, he was almost always the best thing about them and in the role of Bill, this is his best performance in years. Uma Thurman is also effective, as is the cast and Tarantino abandons his usual smart-ass line readings in favor of a western atmosphere. Also on board is Michael Parks who is always a welcome presence. However what really accounts for KBV2's best qualities are the training montage scenes as well as the final showdown which consists of poignant dialog which turns this into more of a tragic piece rather than a simple revenge saga. Plus it's weird but Carradine and Thurman have an odd chemistry which never lets us doubt for a moment that they indeed love each other. Simply put this a movie that is well worth owning on DVD. Even if you aren't a fan of Tarantino's work. * * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",10,3,6,23 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Crushing force
","Obi Wan Kenobi, Qui Gon Jinn and Padme meet a slave kid named Anakin who could be the chosen one. I eagerly anticipated this prequel and it still stands as one of the biggest crushing cinematic disappointments of my life. Everything about this sequel is wooden, the villain Darth Maul while cool looking is merely just a throwaway assassin, the real villain Palpatine is kept kinda on the sidelines and the movie is pretty boring. The pod racing sequence is unexciting because we know he's going to win it cause we know who Anakin is going to grow up to be. Upon rewatch the CGI landscape looks video gamey, the political jargon is nonsensical and because the directing is so flat, none of the story develops any momentum and the smaller scenes meant to be heartfelt feel cloying.*1/2 Out Of 4-(Poor)",3,0,2,30 April 2020
Kickboxer," Kick or die...
",An American kickboxing champion is brutally beaten in a fight against the Thai champion and so his brother vows vengeance. Along the way he finds an old man to train him and whip him in shape because the final fight will be the ancient way. (Hands dipped in broken glass) and the mobsters have a lot of money against our hero. Jean-Claude Van Damme was the king of the tournament movies and Kickboxer is on par with Bloodsport. This is because of the fight sequences which are shot very well and choreographed with energy and detail. Also some cheeseball moments surface such as Jean-Claude Van Damme's drunken master act as well as some of the most overblown training montage music. This is all of course secondary to the mano-a-mano climax between the two fighters and it's well worth the price of admission.* * * out of 4-(Good),7,2,6,22 May 2006
Rocky V," Punching bag...
","Sylvester Stallone returns for his fifth go around as Rocky, this time he is brain damaged due to the fight with Ivan Drago and he has lost all of his money thanks to a crooked lawyer and so he is forced to return to his roots where he understandably wonders why he lost everything he worked so hard to gain. Along the way he trains a new fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who represents Rocky's chance to regain some honor until of course a promoter steals Gunn away and turns him against Rocky which then leads to a street fight. Rocky V if anything else is at least better than the abomination that was Rocky IV, this one is a little more downbeat and depressing as Stallone regains his honor but none of the wealth he throughly deserved. My whole opinion on why Rocky V is rated so low is because it basically puts one of the most likable characters into such a sad situation which nobody wants to see. Rocky V despite what anyone wants to say does have it's share of slow moments but the training montage as well as the final fight sequence works in at least establishing this as a guilty pleasure. The acting is far better in this entry (The Razzies have a prejudice against Sly Stallone) and really it is at least a watchable entry. Although truth be told the trailer made this seem far better than it was in theaters. Also Rocky V is fairly clichéd and generally predictable and lacking in a serious villain. Plus Tony Burton and Burgess Meredith are wasted as they are barely in the movie. Although Meredith provides the best moments of heart in the entire movie. I refuse to give into the notion that this is the worst sequel because Rocky IV was far duller. Plus the final fight sequence is pretty exciting.* * out of 4-(Fair)",5,2,3,2 August 2006
Blade," Open season...
","Wesley Snipes stars as Logan Blade, a vampire hunter/vigilante who has to contest with Deacon Frost(Stephen Dorff) an ambitious vampire looking to become a vampire god, while his ancient counterparts are used to blending in, Frost is looking to take over the world now, only one man stands in his way and it's Blade. One can not imagine a more perfect Blade than Wesley Snipes. Snipes a real life black belt and he certainly puts some nifty martial arts moves that make the action sequences quite exciting. Also the sense of humor as well as the level of gore make this a must see for horror movie and action movie fans in general.* * * out of 4-(Good)",7,0,1,15 June 2006
The Terminator," Targeted for termination...
","Arnold Scwarzenegger stars as a cyborg sent back to 1984 to wipe out Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) due to her giving birth to what will be the savior of mankind in the future. I remember seeing this back when I was 11 back when kids could get into R rated action movies without an ID. I saw this movie and I realized that my mom would have killed me if she would have known what I had been watching in the theater playing this movie. I was used to the R rated blood lust from various Friday The 13th movies and therefore I had walked out of theaters with my friends in an uproar over the carnage. Not this time, my friends and I walked out as if we had seen the goriest snuff film ever made. However I don't want to give off the impression that this was a bad feeling, indeed we went back the next day to see it again! We would feel the same way after seeing Aliens. The Terminator though was unlike anything we had ever seen, the pace was brutal and the action sequences were frightening in their intensity. The police station massacre and indeed even the opening scene set the tone for one of the greatest epics ever saw. It's an awesome movie. It really is. * * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",10,1,2,12 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A more innocent time.
","Luke finishes his Jedi training with Yoda to confront the Emperor, reach out to Darth Vader and save Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba The Hut. If I was honest in my criticism, I'd give this probably a 3 star rating as it is a little bit weaker than the two before it. Also the narrative is a tad disjointed as the beginning is Luke trying to rescue Han Solo, then you get the final training montage, then the Ewoks and then finally the confrontation. All of this works reasonably well, but it feels like you need to have seen the first two to understand the full scale of what is happening. My point is, it's a great sequel, but not as strong as a stand alone. That said, who cares? This sequel is the most character driven and has a lot of heart. There are two tragic death scenes that are moving and an epic light saber showdown climax that probably features the best action sequences in the series. Again, I was not at all disappointed in 1983, and like the others took my wife to rerelease in the 90s, because, sure I loved The Terminator, Rambo and Bruce Lee, but Star Wars was and always will be the cornerstone of my childhood.**** Out of 4-(Excellent)",10,0,0,30 April 2020
The Expendables," Stallone is Dependable...
","A gang of mercenaries (Stallone, Statham, Li, Couture and Crews) take on and single handedly destroy a Colombian army led by rogue CIA agent Eric Roberts and his two bodyguards Stone Cold Steve Austin and Gary Daniels, while Lundgren is kicked out of said gang and turns against his former comrades. The Expendables is a lot of fun, indeed i'm amazed at the reviews this has gotten. Indeed this is pretty much what you would expect, the story is right out of the Golan and Globus play-book, the acting is actually better than that and while the fight sequences rely too heavily on the shaky camera such doesn't take too much away from the choreography or the fact that the Lundgren Vs Li is a highlight. The rest of the action is very well staged and quite exciting. The climax in particular though is what gives The Expendables it's high marks, whether it be throwing a missile and exploding it, or the automatic shotgun this has all the hallmarks of goofy 80s action. Indeed my only complaint would be Lundgren's scant time (hopefully in the sequel he'll get to cut loose) and the way Li's martial artistry wasn't as exploited as it should've been. Other than that this is highly enjoyable stuff and really you get what you pay for. In a time when action cinema doesn't even deliver on the action and body-count (Usually long exposition for 80% of the movie) The Expendables is refreshing to see, It's also nice to see that the stars of our youth still have it. It's no Wild Bunch, but then really what is. Count me in for the sequel and hopefully Stallone recruits Arnold (for more of a part), Van Damme,Norris, Seagal and Michael Dudikoff. * * * out of 4-(Good)",7,4,10,25 August 2010
Blade II," Blood Match....
","Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson reprise their roles as Blade and Whistler, who this time join forces with the vampires to take down a new breed of viscous bad guys called 'Reapers', seems that only sunlight can destroy them and Snipes teams up with Vampire marines to wage a final battle. However there maybe a double-cross among the proceedings. Blade II is a sequel that manages to be even better than it's predecessor. For one the action sequences are imaginatively staged and the gore level is even larger. Snipes as usual has the silent hero thing down pat and Kristofferson is always a welcome sight but the script this time is written with more depth and the relationships between characters manage to give this more of a watchable edge. Also it's very enjoyable, provided you like lots of gore.* * * out of 4-(Good)",7,0,2,15 June 2006
Over the Top," No Holds Barred...
","Sylvester Stallone stars as Lincoln Hawk, an arm wrestling trucker who must not only arm wrestle muscle-bound truckers but wrestle his ex-father-in-law for the love and companionship of his son Mike (David Mendennhall) much arm wrestling ensues in this failed attempt to wring rah-rah cheer from the sport of arm wrestling. I didn't know arm wrestling was a sport but apparently it was an important enough sport to have Sly Stallone sign to rework Rocky out of it. Over The Top is honestly what you would expect from a movie with such a ridiculous premise. Some have called this one of Stallone's worst but I disagree, the movie is fun in spurts and isn't dull. Indeed I admit that the climax kept me amused. Especially since Double Elimination is explained at least 40 times through out, to which we are then reminded when Stallone loses once, that he has one more chance! The movie is very cheese-ball but it delivers what it promises and basically anyone watching this, knows what to expect.* * out of 4-(Fair)",5,0,1,27 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Rising Mediocrity
","Kylo Ren and the new order join forces with Emperor Palpatine to squash the resistance once and for all, Rey is training with Leia while pouting over Kylo Ren. Rise Of Skywalker is what I imagine if Menahem Golan or Roger Corman had bought the rights to Star Wars, it is such a hodge podge of ideas and elements that sometimes come together, but often don't. There are things I liked, again the Kylo Ren arc is compelling, there was potential for so much more, but Adam Driver is such a great actor that Rise Of Skywalker comes to life whenever he's on screen, which unfortunately is not often enough. The first 30 minutes or so is Indiana Jones rip off territory as Finn,Poe and Rey look for a sith artifact and it's really dumb. Like really, really dumb. Again, this is what Cannon films Star Wars would look like. The redeeming quality here is that the movie works better as a schlocky action flick better then it does as Star Wars. So it's not boring and even has it's moments. Again there are a few good scenes, Kylo Ren's return to the light is touching, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill's cameos are welcome and Billy Dee Williams is fun, but overall the well is dry and the thrill is gone.* * Out Of 4-(Fair)",5,15,22,30 April 2020
Rocky II," To be the best...
","This time Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) prepares for a rematch that a critically embarrassed Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) wants to prove that was sheer beginners luck rather than pure skill, so once again Stallone prepares to do battle by training in Philadelphia and this time Rocky is about to be father as he is now married to his beloved Adrian. Rocky II works the same way one of those Jean-Claude Van Damme tournament movies work, it's appeal is spread over the training montage and of course in the fight sequence itself. Rocky II does have some appeal still in the characters but the first one was far more interesting in this approach and although the characters are still fresh the main reason Rocky II is enjoyable is mainly due to the reasons I mention. Once again though there is still enough magic to satisfy fans of this series and it is a formula that one quite enjoys.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",6,1,5,1 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Droning Clones
","This time Obi Wan and Anakin face off against separatists led by Count Dooku, while Chancellor Palpatine has taken more power, also Anakin is in love with Padme. Upon rewatching the prequels, the only one that is necessary to even watch is Revenge Of The Sith. As honestly everything in the first two could've easily been implied in two 10 minute flashbacks. Attack Of The Clones is particularly pointless, again the thrust of this movie is relatively irrelevant, as we know who's pulling the strings and who's going to win and because the movie is as flatly directed and lamely acted as Phantom Menace, the action, politics and drama are largely banal. The love story between Anakin and Padme, which this dreary sequel labors to depict, is even more excruciating.* Out Of 4-(Bad)",2,0,1,30 April 2020
Predator," Big game hunting...
","Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star as two commandos who find themselves the target of prey to an alien hunter who likes to collect the skeleton remains of humans who pose a challenge. At first the commandos think it is a bunch of Latin American rebels but when their unit is picked off one by one, despite heavy weaponry, the unit must band together to survive a threat from out of this world. Predator could very well be the most macho action flick ever made, indeed the commando consists of such he-man type actors as Sonny Landham, Bill Duke, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger, however this macho-ism is actually a sly move due to the contrast of the fact that 'The Predator' is hunting them precisely for that reason. It is great entertainment, with lots of suspense and a memorable creature design. Plus the movie features lots of action and a tight pace which overall make this a great movie. One of Schwarzenegger's best films.* * *1/2 out of 4-(Very good)",8,0,1,18 July 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Saving face...
","Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, this time sent back to take on a far superior model that is programmed to destroy other terminators, however also the fact remains that destroying the data and chips merely postponed judgment day and John Connor (Nick Stahl who replaces Edward Furlong) tries to follow in his mother's footsteps in preventing the war but finds his attempts are futile. Also there is Claire Danes who is also targeted with Connor for termination and who will also grow up to be his wife. Terminator 3 can be seen as somewhat of a comeback for Arnold after witnessing what could possibly be the longest slump of an actor's career. After True Lies, Arnold made what has to be some of the lamest action flicks of his career (And that isn't even counting his embarrassing ventures into comedy and the Batman franchise) Terminator 3 can be seen as a comeback as it is superior to everything he's made since Terminator 2 but generally inferior to everything before. (Let alone the first two of the series) One peak at the title and one is somewhat shocked at the negative emotions regarding this film, a glance at IMDb's forum labels this to come up every now and then as Arnold's worst flick. (Let's not even get into the fact The Terminator and Commando fall behind Eraser and End Of Days in the best category (Shudder)) but this is not the case and Terminator 3 holds up fairly well in the story department which is handled very well. The action sequences are also exciting and Arnold is in good form. The main flaw is the new villain who just isn't as imposing as Robert Patrick or Arnold Schwarzenegger from the original. The novel touch here is that the machine is a female but clearly she doesn't do anything the T-1000 didn't do and even though Loken is adequate, it becomes obvious that she couldn't really hold her own against Arnold. Also the return of Earl Boen (The holdover from the first two movies) is wasted and is basically forgotten soon. Indeed the whole movie feels rushed and seems to indicate that the pace is quick because the director is on a deadline. Indeed usually you want movies to be shortened but for once I would have liked to see it longer so I could have found out more about some key moments which aren't developed due to the main plot. In other words Cameron could make a movie compact and complex. Jonathan Mostow can only make the movie compact and although Terminator 3 is worth watching for the genre fan, it goes without saying that it doesn't hold up when compared to the first two. Which is of course a given.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",6,0,1,4 September 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The verdict is out...
","Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the T-800, a cyborg protector this time sent to defend John Connor (Edward Furlong) against the T-1000(Robert Patrick) who can shift, morph and seems practically invincible. Also on board to aid in the survival of mankind is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who decides not only to stop the T-1000 but also stop judgment day from ever happening. It is interesting that a couple of reviewers have said that this is one of the rare cases where a sequel is better than the original, like The Godfather Part II. I myself am not one to debate since I think that like The Godfather parts 1 and 2 are on a par with each other, as both of them are better in different ways. Ergo the same goes with Terminator 2. Terminator 2 is bigger budgeted and works far better as an action movie but isn't quite as successful as the suspense fueled classic of the original. Also The Terminator is quite possibly the greatest B.movie ever made where as Terminator 2 is a classic blockbuster. Whatever the case I have to cave in and acknowledge the fact that I can't tell you which one is better as this movie has everything you could possibly want in a genre film. Terminator 2 is excellent in it's pace, action sequences, special effects and acting. It moves fast and it has been intensely put together. So in the end it is kind of like the same questions posed by Alien and Aliens, both are better in ways than each other because there are elements that each hold in their classic regard. I will say this though, Terminator 2 contains special effects that are still more spectacular (Even more so) than most movies today.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent. A Must See!)",10,1,1,4 September 2006
Rocky IV," Back 4 more...
","Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa the prize fighter who this time takes on a Soviet superman named Ivan Drago(Dolph Lundgren) who punches really hard, seems Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) made a very stupid move and picked the wrong opponent to come out of retirement to fight because Drago destroys him (Literally) and Rocky trains to get even for this deed. Rocky IV is in my opinion the lamest sequel of the series, mainly because it is so absurd, jingoistic and really stupid. For instance Rocky has gone from being about a movie about regular people into a tale about vengeance and patriotic glory of socking the Soviet union around. Even worse is how Stallone than tries to eat his cake too by providing a speech about how we can all be friends. This just makes one want to throw up at just how mind numbingly syrupy the sequence is. Also of note is how disappointing Dolph Lundgren is as a villain. I like Dolph Lundgren and to his credit his performance is probably the most credible since he was the only main character NOT nominated for a Razzie for 'Worst Actor' but that being said he isn't as fun as Mr. T was and his villain while quite opposing is lost in translation due to the fact that Brigette Neilsen speaks for him. Of course only in a movie with actors like Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Carl Weathers and Michael Patakai can Brigette Neilsen end up making those actors seem like Oscar caliber actors. Neilsen is a useless character and for one was hoping Dolph Lundgren would use one of his 2000 pound punches to knock her dead.* out of 4-(Bad)",2,6,15,1 August 2006
Face_Off," One of Woo's better American efforts...
","John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are on the opposite sides of the law. Travolta is Sean Archer an FBI agent who is trying to bring down Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) while succeeding in almost killing Troy, Archer is faced with the position of having to get surgery that involves trading faces. So Archer does so and becomes Castor Troy to find out the location of a nerve gas bomb however when Troy awakens without a face he forces the doctors to give him Archer's face and now Archer with Troy's face on must not only fight off Castor Troy but also his former allies who think he is the terrorist they are after. Did you get the plot? Suffice to say Face-Off is ridiculous and of course has gaping plot holes. (Isn't Cage and Travolta different heights and different in body structure?) Also the movie is way too long and could have been edited down by thirty minutes. That being said Face Off works fairly well and the action sequences are exciting if a bit too ludicrous. Also what makes this enjoyable is that Woo has managed to craft a movie that works because the characters sell it, Cage is very good as the good guy and provides some excellent acting in the quieter scenes where Travolta is even more impressive in his good guy role and villainous role. It also has it's share of some exceptionally brutal moments which Woo seems to be employing again after the noticeably tame Broken Arrow. Here Woo seems willing to go over the top and in the end gives us a product which feels the closest to his hometown charm that made him one of the best filmmakers in his country. Some people have balked at it's ludicrous story but really this is Woo operating at almost maximum velocity.* * * out of 4-(Good)",7,1,2,3 September 2006
Die Hard 2," Tries Hard...
","Bruce Willis returns as John McClane who this time faces off against mercenaries who have taken over an airport and are threatening to have all the plane crashes, McClane's wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia) is on one such plane and so it's McClane back in action as he ponders how the same thing can happen to the same guy twice. Die Hard 2 to tell you the truth was a mixed bag. On one hand it had lots of action and a brutal edge to the action but also lacks the suspense of the first. In either case though Die Hard 2 is not bad as sequels go. Indeed even though it's directed by Renny Harlin, Die Hard 2 works in-spite of itself. The only flaw is that the movie is feels too much like a carbon copy of the first film only with a bigger is better approach to the stunts. That being said this is a minor flaw to behold and one really doesn't understand the mixed reaction to this film, when the movie is overall very entertaining.* * * out of 4-(Good)",7,30,43,28 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Divided Empire
","Luke trains Rey in the way of the Jedi, meanwhile Kylo Ren has pretty much dismantled the rebellion and has them on the ropes, but Luke has a secret as to why Kylo Ren hates the Jedi. The Last Jedi actually divided my friends, now I actually enjoyed this far more than Force Awakens, I thought it was more ambitious, I thought the idea of Kylo Ren representing neither the Dark Side or the Jedis was intriguing. In fact if I have a complaint is that we didn't learn more on this plot angle, cut out the nonsense in the Vegas planet and gimme that instead. That said my best friend hated it,but my wife loved it, go figure. It seems to cut this way down the middle. I do think Luke Skywalker should've been more mythic, philosophical and more Yoda and less Anakin. That said The Last Jedi's biggest strength are the scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey, I for one found these sequences to contain intrigue as you're not sure if Kylo Ren can turn Rey or if They can turn him. I also find Kylo Ren far more interesting than most of the other characters as he bares a family connection to the original characters and again I would've liked a scene with him and Leia, even in flashback. The fight in the guard room is very impressive and overall the movie's weakest element (Aside from the Vegas planet) is in fact Luke's overall bitterness subplot. I totally get then why many fans hate it, as Luke went from being one of the most idealistic heroes to angry hermit, but overall I liked that they tried something new.***1/2 Out Of 4-(Very Good)",8,4,20,30 April 2020
Mission: Impossible II," Mission Unwatchable...
","John Woo contributes his worst movie to date in giving us the sequel which could quite possibly be one of the dumbest movies ever made. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, a secret agent who this time must keep a chemical agent out of the hands of the usual goons while using all kinds of phony disguises and explosive sunglasses in this assault on the brain. Mission Impossible 2 is John Woo's worst movie. Worse than Hard Target, worse than Blackjack, worse than Once A Thief. (And I enjoyed HT and found some merit in BJ) Where do I start? Well for one an action movie must have well, what is it i'm trying to say, uh, that's right! Action! It needs action and MI2 has hardly any. We get one at the beginning, we get one in the middle and we get one at the end and in between it is some of the dullest plot angles ever recorded. The action sequences are also largely lame with Cruise seemingly in love with himself and it goes without saying the climatic battle between him and Dougray Scott (The guy from Ever After?)is one of the most unintentionally hilarious climaxes ever. Indeed in theaters when Cruise and Scott hit each other in mid air everyone in the theater howled with laughter. Unfortunately had this movie had more amusement I may have actually woke up. MI2 is where Woo stopped being respected and if you don't heed my warnings and see the movie, you'll see why.* out of 4-(Bad)",2,2,4,3 September 2006
Total Recall," Do you suffer from long term memory loss?
","Arnold Schwarzengger stars as Doug Quaid (Persumably no relation to Dennis or Randy) an average joe who gets an artificial vacation only to be swayed into taking an ego trip which his presumed secret agent fantasy turns out to be real to which millions of bad guys come to kill him, there is also about martians, mutants, rebels and politics regarding the price of air. The book originally had the character (Named Quail in the story) get a secret agent vacation to break up his dull life only to wind up awakening his past, where he actually was a secret agent, in the movie though it basically toys with the idea that this is either a dream, his artificial vacation, reality or a product of his lobotomized mind. Once again this all makes the movie ambitious and frequently enjoyable but Verhoeven's kill crazy antics are generally too overwrought for the material and therefore the action takes priority over the story. However there is enough greatness to work and it is an entertaining movie. It just isn't as great as it could have been.* * * out of 4-(Good)",7,1,4,18 July 2006

Rocky probably didn't deserve an Oscar over Taxi Driver but that aside Rocky is a rather uplifting drama that works because it concerns itself with the lives of an average joe. Sylvester Stallone is perfect as the average joe who is down to earth, likable even if not too bright. The fight sequence at the end is in particular well staged and it really does get the blood pumping although it's more about the pride of one man and his chance at accomplishment than it ever is about who is really winning. It really is a good movie that not only opened up a genre but also stands alone as one of the most essential boxing movies ever made.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",10,0,0,1 August 2006

","Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa the beloved boxer who is currently enjoying the fact that he is a champion however this all changes when he is dethroned against hungry contender Clubber Lang (Mr.T the series' best villain) however after aimless thoughts of whether he can win the fight or not he is trained his former champ Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) who teaches him how to regain his edge and take back the heavyweight title. Rocky III is not as good as # 1 but remains superior to parts # 2, # 4 and # 5 (The jury is still out on Rocky VI) mainly due to Mr. T who is easily the series' most enjoyable villain. Mr. T taunts, intimidates and overall demolishes Rocky for the first half and really it is quite believable on why Rocky might not want to get back in the ring. Still Rocky III suffers from some silliness such as the whole Hulk Hogan cameo as well as some philosophy from Carl Weathers but really Rocky III isn't bad as these things go and I for one quite enjoyed not only the fight but basically everything about it.* * * out of 4-(Good)",7,0,3,2 August 2006
Die Hard," Now I have a machine gun...Ho Ho Ho!
","On Christmas eve, John McClane(Bruce Willis) is over at his wife's office party when hi-tech thieves break into said building and look to steal millions of dollars. While collecting hostages in the process, however there is one man who saves the day and it's McClane in what is one of the greatest action movies ever made. I must admit that i'm shocked it took so long to for me to review this. Over the years this has been in my DVD collection, I try to watch it on TV every time it's on and most of all I think it's there with The Terminator,Hunt For Red October and Rocky as the ultimate genre film. The real reason why Die Hard is so great is due to the suspense factor. Sure the action sequences are brilliant and very exciting but what really earns the high marks is just how suspenseful the movie is, it's one of those movies where the hero actually does the most logical things. Unlike the sequels per say, Willis uses the element of surprise and cunning to fight off the bad guys. Unlike the sequels where he was far more one man army. As it stands I remember seeing Die Hard in theaters and remembering being very skeptical of Willis (He was on that show with Cybil Shepherd) but knew right away after watching Die Hard, that Willis would be a great. However as it stands, this movie is a classic. On the other hand it's also a rare instance where one might want to buy a special edition DVD for the extras.

Die Hard with a Vengeance," Like a dead battery...
","John McTiernan and Bruce Willis return for Die Hard With A Vengeance and frankly one is ultimately disappointed with what the final result was. The movie this time finds John McClane(Bruce Willis) and a shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) both joining forces to fight off Simon (Jeremy Irons) the brother of Hans, the villain of part 1. The action this time finds Willis and Jackson driving around the city and looking and answering phones and what not, before coming up with a game-plan that saves the day. Die Hard 2 wasn't very believable but by comparison to # 3 it's the most realistic movie ever made. The problem is just how long the movie is, it follows the same repetitive path and the story lacks any form of plot. Worst of all is just how uninspired it all feels, it's as if McTiernan didn't know what to do with the story and so he just turns it into a long action sequence. Problem is I lost interest half way through and the only redeeming factor is Willis and Jackson's chemistry. (They were way better in Pulp Fiction.) * * out of 4-(Fair)",5,3,7,28 June 2007

","Anakin Skywalker completes his path to the dark side as he finds only The Dark Side can save his wife Padme from certain death. It's not that I hate the prequels, it's that I hate the first two and much to my surprise, really enjoyed this one. Mainly because this is what we wanted to see, I'll grant you the orgins of Anakin could be interesting, but the problem with Lucas is that he tells too much instead of showing, and finally here he does the showing and delivers rousing entertainment, often unintentional,but it's fun nonetheless. Revenge Of The Sith isn't great, but It's very enjoyable, indeed had they had a better actor than Christensen, this could've been something special. As it is, I still enjoy watching this every now and then and still relish watching McDiarmid camp it up. It's all very soap opera esque pulp, but I still years later find this prequel compulsively rewatchable. Guilty pleasure, anyone?*** Out Of 4-(Good)",7,0,0,30 April 2020
Halloween," Do fear the reaper...
","Halloween is usually remembered as a fun time for trick-or-treating, watching scary movies and basically all sort of festivities but in Haddonfield, an escaped murderer has escaped from an asylum and now he's going to paint the town red. Unless Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) can stop the seemingly invincible killer. Jamie Lee Curtis is the goody-goody teenager who is the killer's number 1 target. There are many reasons why I give this movie a four star rating and give Friday The 13th only a 2 star rating. The reason is because Halloween represents the ultimate slasher flick build around suspense and letting your imagination picture what happens before it actually does. Friday The 13th on the other hand is just splatter used to mortify and contains only passable suspense. However Halloween has aged very well as the 70's vibe has actually created a more gritty film that is somehow more creepy. The movie itself isn't scary because I've seen too many slasher films to remain disturbed after the film however Halloween is extremely suspenseful and offers pretty much everything you could want from a scary movie. John Carpenter's score adds tension to an already suspenseful movie.**** out of 4-(Excellent, Must See!)",10,1,2,24 October 2006
Blade Runner," War Of The Worlds...
","Harrison Ford stars as a replicant bounty hunter who the powers that be hire to terminate four replicants who have come to find their creator, along the way Ford discovers his purpose in life as well as some secrets and indeed his ideals start to blur. Blade Runner does have excellent production values, it does have a complex story and it does have a complicated way it deals with its plot threads. (Sometimes too much so) But what I really appreciated mainly about this movie was the hero's conflict with his mission. It's the type of character that is overlooked as one of the many inspirations from this film. Sure the film's pretty sets and tale of robots have inspired many low grade science fiction movies but without the conflicted hero the movie would have no purpose and no real anchor to drive home the film's message. Indeed the hero essayed by Harrison Ford is why I give this 4 stars, his burned out hero sharply contrasts the lights and atmosphere of the film. Without the hero's dim perception of his home this film would be just a work in special effects. That this contrast is made, as well as the hero's indifference to the life he lives compared to the replicants he hunts is what makes the movie the classic it is. So while others will find the sets amazing, the special effects breath-taking, I really found it to be the main character to what made this movie the classic it is. Also like the best science fiction, it's vague, dense and invites you to make your own interpretations as to what happened.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, Must See)",10,0,1,17 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Force Remaking
","Rey, a scavenger meets up with a storm trooper deserter named Finn and a hot shot rebel pilot Poe and joins the rebellion to oppose Kylo Ren and the New Order. Meanwhile Han Solo teaches our three protagonists the ropes while revealing a personal tie to Kylo Ren. Force Awakens is a solid enough sequel that is fine, but lacks any real freshness or even an identity. It's all perfectly serviceable, the new actors are relatively likable (Driver in particular is impressive as Kylo Ren) but the problem is that the movie tries to be too much of a reboot than a continuation of Star Wars and even more disappointing, while we want to know more about the new characters and their story arcs, as both an AWOL storm trooper and the son of Leia and Han leading the New Order holds so much potential and yet Force Awakens is too busy ticking the boxes of nostalgia than focusing on it's potentially interesting ideas.**1/2 Out Of 4-(Pretty Good)",6,12,14,30 April 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Waking up dead...
","Something strange is happening on Elm street, teenagers are mysteriously dying and yet nobody seems to know why, the adults of course are concerned but when the children ask about Freddy Krueger they get nothing but silence as the adults try to stonewall their story. However Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is determined to break the silence and escape the terror once and for all. John Saxon and Ronee Blakely co-star. Nightmare On Elm Street which is of course famous for introducing us to the bogeyman who invaded dreams, is by itself a classic horror movie with lots of suspense. Back in the 80's when it first came out, it was truly frightening and disturbing but now it's lost some of it's edge due to the sequels which took away from the menacing edge Freddy once had. Although it may not be quite as scary, it is however quite suspenseful with a fascinating premise and shocks that work. It is obvious that this is a classic but I for one found the mix of reality and dream-like mentality to be intriguing. One striking sequence in particular is how Langenkamp sinks into the stair way like quicksand, it's a very effective moment which borders on both reality and surreality of a dream with effective tension. If you haven't seen this movie, well you have either been under a rock or are squeamish of violence, never the less for a horror movie this is by far one of the best from the 1980's.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",10,0,0,1 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Beyond The Stars
","Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with a Jedi Ben Kenobi(Guinness), Smuggler Han Solo (Ford) to save Princess Leia (Fischer) from the clutches of Darth Vader and the empire. Wow, how does one review what is possibly my favorite movie growing up? Everything about this film is why I grew up to love B. Movies, science fiction and so on. Star Wars (Now called A New Hope) is sadly a film I actually watched in theaters around Empire Strikes Back, cause I was 5 when it came out originally, and I'll never forget how enthralled I was. There are so many sequences like the garbage disposal escape, the final battle and of course even the fight between Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader while dated by today's standards was at the time the greatest thing ever. Also I was surprised at the outcome, not ashamed to admit this. Here's where I get controversial, as much as I loved Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi, this one was always my favorite. You just had to be there at the time and understand seeing this before the others and having your mind blown. I should point out I've watched this so many times, I even took my wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) to the rereleases in the 90s and it's one I've never reviewed because I don't know if film criticism is in fact criticism if it's fan boy gushing. Therefore I merely say I love this film, it's one of my favorites and I can't recommend it enough. It's too much fun, not to be a 4 star rating.**** Out of 4-(Excellent)",10,0,0,30 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Striking Distance...
","Luke, Han and Leia find themselves waging war against the Empire, along the way they meet the Emperor, Lando, Yoda and find out Luke's hereditary tie to a certain Darth Vader. Again as I said in my review for a New Hope, film criticism from me is practically irrelevant since I love the original 3 movies. The Empire Strikes Back is still one of the most shocking film experiences of my life, mainly in how it ended, in which the good guys lost, Darth Vader was Luke's father and it ended on such a somber note. It also led to extreme debate as to where they would go from here and many kids at the lunch table wondered how this twist came to be. I still stand by A New Hope being my personal favorite, but this is a better overall film, the snow walkers in particular are still breathtaking and Cloud City while not as spectacular in 1980, still holds up really well. At the time this was out of this world and I left the theater crushed at the film's finale, but eagerly anticipating Star Wars 3.**** Out Of 4-(Excellent)",10,1,1,30 April 2020
Windtalkers," War is hell and so is watching this movie...
","Nicolas Cage stars as a soldier who has to protect a Native American code breaker in World War II along the way there are many battles and people fight it out and this reunites Woo with Christan Slater and Nicolas Cage. If anything else Windtalkers explains exactly how far Slater's career had fallen, Slater has a pretty big part and despite being a major character is billed behind Adam Beach and like a couple others. Considering that he hasn't done much since, it goes to show that Slater hadn't fallen on some career speed-bumps. Although this is slightly before Slater made a comeback in the movie we all remember him for Uwe Boll's Alone In The Dark (Not!) Windtalkers itself is a sub-par effort that is closer to Platoon Leader than Platoon and basically we sit and watch as the various soldiers are marked for death and watch as Woo tries extremely hard to make this more interesting than it is. Nicolas Cage also tries hard but once again the movie is so clichéd and tries so hard to be uplifting we never buy into the concepts the actors try to sell with what can only be interpreted as performances. Still there is one good decapitation that always kicks some like into the proceedings. Although I didn't know the Japanese carried samurai swords into the World War II battlefield.*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)",3,3,4,3 September 2006
