The New World," Boring
",What an incredible boring movie. This has absolutely nothing to do with 'what movie making is all about'. A movie should take your breath away and that is the single thing you need here in order to keep breathing while you are sleeping.This movie could have been made 60 minutes shorter easily. All you see is 2 persons in love and constantly looking each other with a look in their eyes where only women could fall for.Besides that the music in this movie is very lame as well. The only good thing about that is that it helps you getting to sleep.Good night !,2,1,6,30 September 2008
Sucker Punch," Finally a movie that makes you think again.
",After all the movies I've seen which such a high entertaining-value it was time for a movie to surface which had more to it then the eye would see at first. A friend told me to watch this movie and after a while I sat down and watched it. At first I wasn't sure what the movie wanted to tell me but while watching the movie more and more of what is happening is clear.The gift of Snyder is that he can make a movie which lets you focus on one aspect and it turns out to be different. This is what I like to see in a movie where not everything that you see should be taken for granted but you have to think for yourself as well to see more then the screen shows you. I loved the ending and I saw while searching the internet that it started some discussion of how the ending could be seen.There are a few theories possible. Go watch this movie and check which theory suits yours !,Null,3,6,28 August 2011
The Hunger Games," Never gets off the ground
","So, I am also someone who didn't read the books but still was eager to watch this movie after I saw the trailer and the high ranking it got on different websites.The first 20 minutes had the most depth for me. You saw Katniss' world and where she came from but all was still very basic. It's gets explained very quickly why they have the Hunger Games and then we see all sorts of weird dressed people. Nobody knows why they are dressed like that and knows anything about that world.I already read some good reviews (emptygravity for example) who said everything spot on. After a slow start of about 60-70 minutes you still hardly know anything about the characters. You know who mostly wins, who is good at what but it all remains very basic.Therefore when a tribute dies I did not feel anything. Not anger, compassion or anything as in the movie they are just shells, fillers that you know will die anyway and that's it.I won't go any further by saying what already has been said. The opinion I have is one I share with Emptygravity. Look up his review, it's spot on!It's a pity as the movie was entertaining when just lying on the couch watching but there are too many flaws and weird things happening that you start to wonder if this really is all the story they have in a book- based-movie.The movie just never pulled me in, it never gets off the ground and in the end it just wasn't convincing enough to leave me thinking when the movie was done.Pity. A missed chance.",5,2,3,11 August 2012
Spider-Man 3," Could have been way better
","Why why why aren't they making movies like Batman Begins anymore...In Spider-Man 3 almost everything happens without a reason and explanation. The black fluid that drops out of the sky in the park ? Where did it came from ? What is it ? Why did it drop on earth ? The criminal escapes to some facility where they are working with strange machines on the sand so that this guy becomes the sandman. What are they doing at that facility ? What do they want to get as a result ? Venom. A pretty cool character but in the movie they never call it Venom. It just has no name in the movie.Alter-ego: When Peter Parker feels good he dances on the street and doing macho-things. If he's doing this in real life, it's his choice, but why put this stupid scene in the movie, it has no use at all.So, after all this said, I really think they made 2 movies of Spiderman 3 where they add more depth to the story so that it just won't feel as a cheap entertainment movie.Kirsten Dunst is a lovely girl. But when she visits Harry and they go dancing on the song 'Twist' or whatever it's called I am wondering what the producer wants to say with this scene. It's not what I want to see when I go to the cinema for Spider-Man 3. I want to see him fighting tugs with a story. Not just 2 enemies with no story (not in the movie) It's just too bad. It could have been so much more.",4,5,7,10 June 2007
