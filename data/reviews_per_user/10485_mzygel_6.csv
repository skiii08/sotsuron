Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Perfect Start
","This was a great movie and critics did not understand the purpose of it. A Newsweek critic said that everyone expected to see how anakin turned to the dark side and is disappointing not to find that out, well this is another trilogy and of course Darth Vader is not on Episode 1 and I don't think he will appear in Episode 2 either. I think when the trilogy is completed everybody will see the P. Menace as a great film.",10,8,10,24 August 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Oscar mistake
",The worst movie ever to win an Oscar. Miramax really bought the award for this one. Judi Dench got an award for only ten minutes of acting. Life is Beautiful and Saving Private Ryan are ten times better then this film.,1,9,19,9 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A total failure and the murder of a saga
","You probably read this before, but Palpatine is alive. How he survivived? Who cares.But that decision by the 'writers' killed Star Wars, which was suposed to be the story of rise, fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight. Him 'killing' Palpatine in ROTJ to save his son has no meaning now.Can someone tell me why would you build a droid, insert a particular language in it system, but does not allow him to translate anything written in that language?!?!",1,30,50,1 January 2020
The Godfather: Part III," Great ending
","Despite some comments you may read, this movie is as good as the first two and in some ways is better.  Al Pacino is superb as Michael Corleone as is Andy Garcia as Vincent Mancini. The only thing that I miss from the other films is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.",10,0,1,1 September 2003
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Spectacular adaptation
",Coppola delivers a superb adaptation of Bram Stoker's masterpiece. Gary Oldman is amazing as Count Dracula and the same applies to Hopkins performance. The music is also great specially Annie Lennox's 'Love song for a vampire'. I gave this film a 9 because of Reaves's mediocre performance. This guy can't act and I can't believe Coppola gave him a part in his Dracula project.,9,1,2,19 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Simply the best Star Wars movie
","I am a huge Star Wars fan and I have to say this is the best of all movies. From Luke's training with Yoda to his battle with Vader and finding out he is his father, this is a superb cinematic experience.Vader's presence is incredible in the movie. He is so powerful that you know Luke has no chance of defeating him without completing his training.Can't wait for the DVD.",10,0,1,19 December 2003
