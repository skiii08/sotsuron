Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Undwerwhelming in the character department, but retains the imagination and excitement befitting a Star Wars film
","I once came across a complaint concerning an early scene in Episode I, wherein the two main Jedi drink tea, cited as evidence of the director losing sight of what makes the Star Wars films so exciting. Yet the subsequent sequence includes the sight of two Jedi fighting side by side, blaster bolts deflected in rapid succession, a lightsaber plunged into a metal door to melt it, and eerie insect-like machines with shield generators. How many upgrades to things in the original films were crammed into this one sequence?Don't get me wrong, for this is not intended to uphold 'The Phantom Menace' as a great piece of filmmaking. It still has a host of defects, many of which have been multiplied or magnified due to the clamoring of a fanbase overly insistent on being offended. Yet, its successes have been largely dismissed, and it is not the painful experience that many have declared it to be. Despite modern critics pandering to the fanbase with textbook theory and overcomplicating the matter, the biggest issue has always simply been the 'less than compelling' characters. The story, despite the occasional straining of logic and uneven pace, is passable, and, to its credit, contributes to the two primary subplots of the prequel trilogy: the creation of Vader and the establishment of the Empire. Disregarding the other prequels, I think it is interesting to learn that the Jedi leaders originally had grave doubts about Skywalker's future, a grim reminder of what eventually happens. However, I do agree that placing more weight and focus on a development as significant as the resurgence of the Sith would have made for a more streamlined experience. But, I digress. Criticism towards the characters, while not unwarranted, has been misdirected. Most of the actors put forth earnest efforts, particularly Ewan McGregor and Pernilla August. The problem is that they weren't given much to work with. Qui-Gon Jinn, despite having maverick-like characteristics that befit his role in the story, is too subdued for a central figure, and we don't get much beyond the very basic mentor/student dynamic between him and Obi-Wan. Queen Amidala gets by on admirability and determination. True, she makes some hasty or unwise decisions, but given her age and established inexperience that shouldn't be surprising. Her good intentions are constantly highlighted, so she gets credit for that, and I can't say I was unimpressed by how she conducted things during the climax. Some of the more effective characters don't have much substance, but are memorable, and sometimes that's more important in this film series. The CGI alien creatures, with one glaring exception, are a delight to watch. The shrewd, abrasive Watto is particularly interesting, and a testament that something simple as a unique means of locomotion can add much. The sleazy, hot-headed Sebulba is also great, and Boss Nass is amusing. The secondary villain, Darth Maul, may not have much screen time, but capably fills the role of a menacing, shadowy assassin. No doubt ever exists in the audience's minds that he is a capable threat. Notice how he refrains from the usual doubt exposing taunts, indicating his desire for a purely physical victory. Two aspects of the film that are indisputably well done are the effects and music, both of which have always been crucial to the Star Wars franchise, and both of which save 'The Phantom Menace' from true mediocrity. The reason for this is summed up well by the great Roger Ebert, who wrote, 'the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects'. People have grown so preoccupied with other aspects of production that they adamantly proclaim the impossibility of a film succeeding by virtue of its technical aspects; they're wrong. Such movies as 'Spider-Man 3', 'Transformers 2' and 'X-Men 3' were unable to do this because their visual effects were underutilized, ugly, or plumb not impressive. The standards of special effects in the 'Star Wars' movies have always been far above average, and this evident extra effort helps make up for deficiencies. Consider the string of expository scenes after the main group arrives at Coruscant. The individual discussions are mostly stale, but the scenes look so good that this part of the movie hardly feels bogged down.The 4-faceted climax is by far the best section of the movie, and helps overcome the preceding feelings of mundaneness. Though the space assault feels perfunctory and lightweight, the other 3 subplots are entertaining in their own way. The capture of Viceroy Gunray has its fair share of surprises (am I the only one that thought it was neat that a female character was essentially saved by another female character?), and the battle between the gungan and droid armies benefits from interesting new technologies. As much as I like the AT-ST walkers, this battle is an order of magnitude above the ground battle of 'Return of the Jedi'. The best segment is the duel between Maul and the Jedi, which remains a fine demonstration of innovation and upsurge in kineticism, trends that will extend to the succeeding two installments. While it remains the least of the 'Star Wars' film series (not counting the debacle that was 'The Clone Wars'), 'The Phantom Menace' manages to be passable. Yes, it has lapses in logic, unsubstantial characters and fails to truly expand the mythos, but, as the critical reaction indicates, these do not demolish the entertainment value to the extent that some would profess. Audiences expected greatness, Lucas delivered adequacy, but given that more than a decade has passed I implore people to adopt a better attitude about it.",6,2,3,13 May 2015
Star Trek," Well made and promising, though it has room for improvement in terms of thrills
","Star Trek was the unexpected success of the 2009 summer season. It's not hard to understand the reason for this. As James Rolfe put it, 'it has a kick to it, which makes it more commercial than any Star Trek'. I can't help but wonder, though, if timing had something to do with its success. Much like how 'Godzilla 2000' may not have been so well received were it not for the failure that preceded it, it's not difficult to suspect that this film may have garnered less praise had it not followed the divisive entries in a certain other franchise.There is not much delivery on the promise to 'boldly go where no Star Trek has gone before', which is something that Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli have already discussed far better than I can. This prevents this movie from truly being the groundbreaking project that a re-imagining can potentially be. Even so, there are many things that I admire about it. The style is noticeably different from any other space opera of its decade, granting a breeziness that is appropriate for a summer blockbuster. J.J. Abrams seems to have an apt for this genre, providing plenty of fast paced sequences and good scenery. It's not very often we get to see the Enterprise stationary upon land, where I believe it looks more impressive than in space. The performers are all competent given what they are aiming for, bolstered by some rather effective humor. However, it is somewhat disappointing that so many of them are underutilized. Most of them really amount to superficial updates of previous incarnations, which will not do much for the casual moviegoer. Kirk and Spock are the only substantial ones, though Spock is less successful due to giving the impression of a self-righteous teenager for much of the first half. Pine is suitably entertaining and arrogant as Kirk, managing to put a new spin on the familiar captain. Even so, I will say that, as far as an initial chapter is concerned, there is a much better effort at establishing the characters than there was in 'The Phantom Menace'.Where 'Star Trek' falls short of the Star Wars prequels, however, is in imagination and excitement, a comparison merited due to a style that veers closer to an action packed space opera than a traditional science fiction film. The special effects are all polished and mostly pleasant to look at, but lack that creative flair that made those other space operas so visually versatile. This can be seen in both the creatures and hardware. Aside from the iconic Enterprise, the space vessels are rather forgettable and fail to inspire awe from the viewer; the villains float around in what looks like a giant mutated pine-cone. The most creative ship is the one that contains the red matter and seems to have some type of gyroscopic structure, but compared to some of the other things seen in space operas in recent years it might as will be a wind-up toy. As for the creatures, consider that red thing on the snowy planet that Kirk is jettisoned to. It's definitely weird, but there's something disorganized and fleeting about it. The giant red angler fish and bio-luminescent eel from 'The Phantom Menace' managed to leave a better impression. The biggest issue is the villain, Nero. While his motives are made clear, he's not built up as a very impressive threat, mostly because it is painfully obvious that without his ship he is just another guy with a grudge. Compared to the unnerving quality of the Borg and the craftiness of Khan, I don't see Nero looming in the minds of many following the closing credits.Nonetheless, this is definitely a successful outing for the Star Trek franchise, which has suffered a rather bumpy road with its feature films. I recommend it for its entertaining characters, humor and sleek effects, all of which hopefully will be taken in a more interesting direction with its second sequel.",7,0,0,24 February 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Satisfying, But With a Pervasive Sense of Untapped Potential
","After two viewings, I remain uncertain how to feel about 'Rogue One'. Originally, I was prepared to label it a depreciation from 'The Force Awakens', but the second round was notably more enjoyable, and leaves me regarding it, for the time being, as more or less on the same level as the 2015 feature. Whatever the case, this is an unorthodox, sometimes frustrating and sometimes poignant addition to the Star Wars canon.On the level of functionality as a prequel, 'Rogue One' is adequate. It reveals the events that led up to the beginning of 'A New Hope', much of which is entertaining, but little of which enhances the pertinent conflict. Too much of the runtime is devoted to either gathering the main group or shallow attempts at a typical war movie moral ambiguity; it's a needless complication that further affirms that the people behind these movies are all too insistent on bowing down to fan demands. Keeping track of numerous individuals and agendas can be moderately difficult, but this problem is significantly reduced in subsequent viewings, after one understands where everything is headed. Strangely, substantial numbers have objected to the film's dependence on the context provided by 'A New Hope'. Oh my, the EIGHTH entry in an iconic, long established film series assumes familiarity with that series? What an outrage! How dare they make a Star Wars movie specifically geared towards Star Wars fans? As has been trumpeted in most circles, the large cast of characters is underdeveloped. It is notable, however, that most everyone is given a personal reason for being involved. These aren't fully capitalized on, but they are there, and bring just enough substance to the key players to make their endeavors engaging. Jyn Erso, despite some good fighting scenes, doesn't resonate for most of the runtime. Her ideally solid motivations aren't given weight until the mission at Skarif, when she gets to act upon them. More interesting aspects of her character, such as her family's belief in the Force and her ability to lift morale, are underutilized. Cassian Andor is notably better, and the only member of the group convincingly molded by war. 'Rogue One' should have devoted much more effort to this angle of exploring how the war effected people on a personal level, rather than shoehorning an overly clamored for moral grayness.The villains are overall better, primarily because of familiar faces. Krennic is a letdown. Though he certainly stands out with his distinctive white uniform, he falls victim to the bewildering new trend of turning Star Wars villains into pathetic pretenders in a cheap attempt to elicit sympathy. Plus, his attempts at humor are out of place.Some were quick to criticize Vader's final scene as intrusive, unnecessary and inappropriate, claiming that it overrides the impact of the climax. Considering the greater context and the villain's purpose in the movie, I would say different. Vader's inclusion here (essentially an extended cameo) is preparatory to his role in 'A New Hope', and his final scene builds momentum and anticipation as 'Rogue One' segues into the conflict of the succeeding chapter. Additionally, the transmissions, the fruits of the main characters' efforts, are also followed during these final scenes, keeping the significance of the climax alive.Gareth Edwards once again shows a talent for impressive sights, and 'Rogue One' is filled with great looking settings and excellent cinematography. While this is yet another instance of answering fan complaints, specifically the abundant use of green-screen in the prequel trilogy, it brings a sense of scope that helps set this entry apart from its immediate predecessors. Nevertheless, most of these places work better as sights (and very good ones, to be sure) than supplements to the story. Jedha, for example, feels less like a city ravaged by war than a settlement that has simply always been harsh. Any undercurrent of suffering or struggle fails to manifest itself. As is, the visuals mostly amount to the 'used future' concept dialed up to 11. 'Rogue One' needed more moments like the scene aboard Andor's ship after the escape from Jedha, where one can feel how shaken the group is by recent events.The end battle is an ambitious application of the multi-faceted climax structure first seen in Episode VI. The space engagement is top notch, while the ground battle is a definite improvement over its Endor counterpart. At times, it is easy to lose track of the proceedings, but if one pays attention it is impressive how everything is planned. Furthermore, this is the primary segment of the film to carry narrative weight in the larger context (although the stakes are clear even when only considering this film). The actual procedure of stealing the technical readouts is a little protracted and could have used more involvement by the main group, but it does what it has to. It creates a sense of challenge and commitment, and gives the heroes opportunity to contribute to something critical. My only issue with this sequence is the palm tree filled setting. It's disconnected from the style seen in the rest of the film, and makes the battle seem more like it takes place in Malibu. Regardless, the closing scenes are terrific.'Rogue One' is a reasonably entertaining and at times bold addition to the film series. It provides further background on the original story, gives us a few good actions sequences and memorable moments. Nevertheless, it's high time the series broke away from the Galactic Civil War. Filmmakers are going to have to move past the restrictions imposed upon them by fan complaints if they intend to expand the horizons of this franchise. Otherwise, the day will not be far off when the great Roger Ebert's comment on Star Trek in 2002 will also apply here: 'gradually it occurs to me that 'Star Trek' is over for me. I've been looking at these stories for half a lifetime, and, let's face it, they're out of gas'.",7,1,3,4 January 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Feels more like an extended TV episode, which is the mark of a lesser installment
","One of the many eternally pointless disputes of the last few decades is the rivalry between the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. It's a topic I prefer to avoid because there really is little to discuss beyond a few points. Aside from the obvious difference in objectives and style, both franchises have a different dominant medium; it is utter folly to compare a television series to film. However, purely as a film series, Star Wars is the clear winner. Despite varying opinions on the quality of the individual Lucas-helmed movies, the Star Trek film series' episodic nature prevents it from achieving the scope and flow of its rival. Most of the individual movies don't complement each other, leaving half of them feeling more like bloated episodes of the television series' than big theatrical events. Why do I start on this brief point? I was originally let down by the fact that 'Into Darkness' doesn't lend itself to a larger tale, but have since come to accept that that's a given with these movies. What really cements this potential problem is that the plot lacks the momentum of a feature length production. The first half is too splintered, shamelessly dropping in elements that weren't present in the previous movie and not exploring them fully. Wouldn't the big machination by Admiral Marcus have had greater impact if we had gotten to know this guy earlier, or actually explored the nature of the Klingons from this timeline? Because so many things are shortchanged (like the Spock/Uhura relationship), the movie feels like it's scrambling about to find its footing, until the second half that features a drawn out jaunt into space. For a better example of this type of narrative, watch 'Godzilla X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.'. The second big problem with 'Into Darkness' is that it is premature. Clearly, it was intended to be the 'Empire Strikes Back' in its own line, with everyone thrown into a desperate hour. But we haven't become sufficiently familiar with this group for such an event to have weight, nor is anyone's personal journey taken in a direction of particular interest (success in the latter is one of the reasons 'The Dark Knight' and 'Spider-Man 2' are excellent sequels). The lack of scope, an established threat and sense of consequences doesn't help. All things considered, the affair has all the symptoms of acting significant when it clearly isn't. The promising ending didn't necessitate anything that preceded it. It's a shame that all the focus on the stagnant story detracts from the cast of characters. As was the case in the previous movie, Kirk and Spock receive the lion's share of attention; no other member of the crew ever amounts to more than a prop for the story. Unfortunately, some of this is rushed in context, adding to the premature or hollow feel. Kirk temporarily loses command of his ship even though we've hardly witnessed his exploits as captain, Scotty's dismissal is virtually impossible to care about for similar reasons, while Pike's death, though well shot and acted, comes too early into the proceedings. Spock's concerns with fear and death are criminally underutilized, and one of the few elements that carry over from the previous movie. Benedict Cumberbatch is the sole standout as this timeline's version of Khan, and the only true reason to watch the movie; the confrontations between him and Spock are intense and vastly more interesting than those between the former and Kirk. As with its predecessor, the style favors action over protracted philosophical commentaries. But, as has been made very clear before, the Star Trek franchise does not lend itself very well to this sort of thing (and I'm sick of those phasers). Too much of the running length concerns multiple parties talking each other down, sizing each other up or SLOWLY progressing towards critical points with minimal payoff. The abundance of scenes within the Enterprise grow stale very quickly, and those lens flares reach a new level of irritating. Subtitling the movie 'Into Darkness' was very deliberate, since there is an exorbitant amount of shaded scenes, but this makes everything less pleasant to look at rather than infusing them with a somber quality; just another example of trying too hard for a dark tone. The best fight in the movie is Khan's ground skirmish with a bunch of Klingons, which, in addition to boasting several unique weapons, is a good mix of armed and unarmed combat. For all these issues, I cannot in good conscience label 'Into Darkness' a bad movie. The acting remains above par for a blockbuster and there are a few moments of genuine poignancy. But with a story too small for a feature length film, it's more a random chapter than a significant leap forward, not exactly the best way to further the reinvigoration of a venerated franchise.",6,0,4,11 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Uneven and often dramatically flat, but provides enough intriguing developments and action to entertain
","Summer blockbusters are experiencing a decline in second installments. Since 2008, they haven't been able to surpass or even meet the quality of their predecessors, the only exception being 'The Winter Soldier'. It's a shame because superior sequels were once practically a guarantee, a trend that even stretches back to the 1990's with 'Aliens' and 'Terminator 2'. The second Star Wars prequel falls into that category. Though not as well received as 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' or 'Age of Ultron', this is (in terms of visuals, story and action), a more dynamic and satisfying motion picture than either of those. Despite several contrivances and flags, 'Episode II' manages to engage thanks to a steady stream of intriguing developments and an acceptable balance of story elements. The double subplot structure echoes 'Episode V' and, unlike the first prequel, the truly significant stuff doesn't feel like byproducts of some relatively minor conflict. Contributions to Skywalker's journey and the transition of the old system to the Empire are at the forefront, and when everything converges to the beginning of the Clone Wars it really feels as if the saga has taken a great leap forward. Political content remains, but these are largely part of the backdrop and give the impression of a republic on the verge of civil war. The (necessary) romance subplot has elicited the most ire, some of which is justified. Truth be told, it's not terrible, just largely hit-and-miss. Yes, the dialogue is cliché riddled and the progression in attraction doesn't feel natural, but this isn't the nadir of movie romances. There are some appreciable interactions, such as the dinner scene and when she takes control of the situation right before they set off to help Obi-Wan. My favorite moment between them is a quick exchange in the arena that recalls an earlier conversation. It's a shame really; these two work surprisingly well when fighting alongside each other (even Han and Leia never really showed this type of synergy). John Williams' theme for this subplot is noteworthy because, honestly, I think it's better than the love theme from 'Episode V'. It's more elegant and an overall more pleasant piece of music.The cast is, thankfully, given more to work with, and if one isn't too concerned with who they are, there's at least enough to care about what they do. Skywalker is popularly reviled due to his impulsiveness and complaints, but I don't find it to be as much of an issue. A couple of scenes push the peevishness, but time is taken to show that he's not without merit. He commends the jedi leaders at least once, saves Obi-Wan's life and, most notably, shows great remorse for his actions at the Tusken camp. It is here that the personal failings that ultimately lead to his conversion first come to light. Natalie Portman seems more confident in the role of Padme, as the character shows an increase in determination and proactivity, even more capability in a fight. Obi-Wan mostly serves as a guide for the audience, but during his investigations you really get the feeling that he's the workhorse of the group, which grants him some esteem. Christopher Lee is under-appreciated as Count Dooku, whose confidence is evident in every scene. He's a convincingly capable enemy, one surprisingly good with words, though it's lamentable that we don't learn more about his fall. From the encounters with Windu and Yoda, it's clear that much is left unexplored. The CG are a delight, particularly the Kaminoans and the ever-rugged Watto in a surprisingly sentimental scene, while the CG Yoda boasts a strong presence throughout, similar to a grizzled master warrior. The typical 'Star Wars' high standard for visual effects once more elevates the experience, with an overall look that can best be described as refreshing. In addition to the polished, gloomy Kamino and John Carter/termite-inspired Geonosis, we are treated to new perspectives of older settings. Coruscant is given more life than before (as well as some noir-like visuals that complement the mystery aspect of the narrative), Naboo's scenery is expanded and Tatooine has a darker side displayed. Unfortunately, (with the exception of McGregor) Lucas failed to extract appropriate reactions from the cast, yielding the common complaint of a disconnect between the performers and settings. Even so, ambition is evident and half measures scarce; you'd be surprised how many of those backdrops are not CG (the Geonosian Arena, for instance). The final 40 minute action sequence is well worth the wait, possibly the best conceived battle in the series at the time, building to a massive conflict that gives the full impression of warfare. Sporting hundreds of lightsaber wielding jedi, 3 creatures, the imposing super battle droids and a host of new war vehicles, there is no shortage of memorable images. Those missile firing hail-fire droids and turbo- laser platforms, in particular, are outstanding..One thing I will freely admit is that the final lightsaber duel makes little sense past a certain point. Yet, it's still an engaging sequence; innovation and sheer progression in intensity can go a long way. I'm not of the opinion that involving Yoda in swordfighting undermines his contributions to the mythos. His comments on size pertain not to general matters, but to its lack of bearing on the capacity to perform feats with the Force. The fact that he is able to perform such difficult maneuvers that outclass his colleagues', despite pertinent physical limitations, reaffirms that notion; it further shows his mastery of the Force. Though 'Episode II' has its faults (forced romance, stilted performances, villains with untapped potential), its contributions to the saga make it a worthy addition. If you're looking for deep, compelling personalities and relationships, you'll be sorely disappointed. But, for those who appreciate the entertainment value brought by impressive sights, energetic action sequences and a momentous story, this one gets a hearty recommendation.",7,3,6,26 May 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The best and most consequential of the X-Men movies so far
","I wouldn't consider myself an avid fan of the X-Men. I know the basics of most of the characters and am familiar with some of the more significant stories, but as a whole they don't really command my respect, especially in regards to their film counterparts. In fact, out of the previous 6 movies, the only key players to leave a particularly good impression are Magneto and Nightcrawler. 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', however, flies in the face of expectations on multiple levels, and may represent the apex of this rocky film series.The 'X-Men' movies have suffered from 3 common problems, one of which is remedied, one of which is kind of remedied, and one that is only worse. These problems are: an overabundance of characters, Wolverine's portrayal and the action.Considering the wide array of superpowers, it's a wonder that none of these movies excel in terms of action. Most of the more impressive abilities are given a limited showcase, and most of the skirmishes are limited to mundane hand-to-hand combat. To date, the best of these remains the infiltration of the White House by Nightcrawler in 'X2'. 'Days of Future Past' is a definite downgrade in this arena, which is what disappointed me greatly upon the first viewing. The only thrilling/amusing sequence in this respect is the extraction of Magneto with Quicksilver, and the glimpses into the future war seem to tease us with a far more interesting conflict. However, when focusing on the other aspects of the production, this failing becomes almost trivial.Going off of the topic of action, Wolverine's portrayal is mostly improved. Sure, he's still a punching bag when fighting other superhumans, but, as with every other major player here, he works better as a realized individual than an action figure. In addition to the usual witticisms, Wolverine's role greatly demonstrates how much he has matured over the course of this film series, largely because it poses a challenge that can't simply be sliced. It centers on his admiration for Xavier and determination to fulfill his mission.'Days of Future Past' doesn't have a huge cast in competition for screen time. The focus is squarely on the 4 key players, with Beast along for the ride. Sure, there are other mutants present, but there is no pretending that their role is anything more than supplementary. It's an approach that allows for the relationships to feel more pertinent and natural. The evolution of the opposing ideologies of Xavier and Magneto is much more poignant than in 'First Class', where it didn't feel convincing for wanting of time. They're clearly affected by the weight that comes from championing the two sides of a conflict, and, thankfully, it is shown that there indeed were hard feelings over their last encounter. In this respect, the juxtaposition between their interactions in the past and future is kind of striking.Jennifer Lawrence continues to grow in the role of Mystique, showing rudimentary aspects of the incarnation from the earlier films. Her time on screen is noticeably lesser than that of the other key players, but no scene is wasted; her prowess as an infiltrator and hardy demeanor are on full display. Peter Dinklage, on the other hand, is a waste as Bolivar Trask. He was clearly chosen for the role due to his current popularity, and the character fails to come across as anything more than pompous, as opposed to someone with credible reasons for what he is doing. William Stryker from 'X2', despite his zealous approach, remains the most convincing mutant loathing human from the films. I'm actually curious if they'll ever dispose of the 'gray area' approach and include someone who simply has an extreme prejudice of mutants, and is all the more lethal for it. The shadowy Director from the comics would be an ideal candidate for this.Thanks to an early established objective for these guys, the storyline is more concentrated and better flowing than in the previous installments. Not to mention, it's not an objective that merely allows for a string of skirmishes; it requires crucial developments from those involved and lends a palpable sense of weight, both of which weren't strong suits for the other 'X-Men' movies. Very little feels out of place or unnecessary, and everything builds to a climax that fails on the visceral level, but is ultimately more fulfilling than that. For the first time in a decade, I can say that I'm interested in the next direction this series will take.",8,0,1,27 September 2015
The Incredibles," Relatively edgy and violent, but also smart and observant, this is an excellent family feature
","As Roger Ebert once pointed out, 'On the surface, 'The Incredibles' is a goof on superhero comics. Underneath, it's a critique of modern American uniformity'. That it is, a double-objective accomplished by emphasizing the incompatibility between the fantasy antics of the superhero world, and our own. The result is a marked attempt to broaden the Pixar audience, and a stand-out action flick. Given the central group, it should come as no surprise that family dynamics are the best asset. Of course, to one degree or another, all the Pixar films are about families; the 'Toy Story' trilogy made this a progressively emphasized component. What sets 'The Incredibles' apart is how observant it is about the subject. Some of the best scenes in the movie simply show the interplay amongst the family members, and throughout we witness marital dissonance, sibling rivalry, parental concern, etc. It's all portrayed convincingly and makes the characters come alive in a down to Earth way rarely achieved in the Pixar movies. More importantly, we care about these guys, because they clearly care about each other, even if they sometimes have a difficult time showing it. Nothing quite like thwarting a villainous plot for bonding time. Concerning the individual characters, Bob and Helen are the standouts. The former is actually a pretty complex creation for this genre, and the screenplay quite cleverly adapts the whole mid-life crisis element to his circumstances. He has a desire to help people, and tries to do so with what life has allowed him. The problem is that he doesn't feel valued for his efforts. More importantly, he doesn't value his line of work, which he believes wastes his capabilities (that last point serves as an interesting running theme also evident in the kids and Edna), and such a lack of motivation follows him home. A call for parents to draw a more stark line between work and home, perhaps? Helen, I believe, is the stronger character, and one of my personal favorites from the Pixar canon. She's the more level-headed of the two and throughout the movie has to keep everyone else in check. It's a great demonstration of the importance of her role in her family and greatly endears us to her. Not to mention, she's got a real knack for quick thinking. The other characters serve their purposes adequately. Syndrome is an amusing spoof of megalomaniacal bad guys (e.g. Lex Luthor), while Edna (a delightful nod to Q from the James Bond series), with her seemingly endless resources, dismissive attitude about her height and exacting attitude, may be my favorite supporting character in these movies. Violet and Dash aren't defined much beyond basic attributes, but their presence reinforces certain themes (notice how much more confident they seem after using their abilities in fulfilling ways) and their subplots are resolved well. I particularly liked how Dash's school race at the end was more an exercise in self-control than 'being the best by a tiny bit'. At that point, his relatives' opinions were the only ones that mattered. How nice. On the visual level, this one is not quite as fanciful as, say, 'Toy Story 2' or 'Finding Nemo'. There's a good variety of locations and the costumes really pop on screen, largely due to the combination of black with bright red, but overall this movie has a relatively subdued look. Even so, it gets major points for the actions of its key players. Every major member of the Parr family has a pretty standard superpower, but these are all utilized in a wide variety of dynamic and interesting ways. I still remember feeling surprised at Elastigirl's first display of speed and agility, a good indicator of the energy with which these powers are portrayed. Beyond that, it's also worth noting how the characters use their powers for expression (notice Violet hiding from her crush and Helen increasing in height as she yells) or for ordinary, everyday actions. It makes certain scenes that much more interesting to watch. Beyond that, I love the sense of scale. Bob staring up at an absurdly large computer screen almost gives the impression of being in an IMAX theater, while the Omnidroids both look and feel big, thanks to both the quality of animation and camera angles. All this being said, 'The Incredibles' is not perfect. For one, it does take longer to kick off than others in its own line. The first act, while necessary to set-up the main story, doesn't really cut loose in a way one would expect. This is supposed to be the golden age of superheroes; shouldn't there be more seen in action? Once we get to the family dinner scene, things start to get good. What's more, I would have preferred more interaction within the Parr family, which is sparse for a considerable chunk of the running length. The way that Bob comes to appreciate Helen and the kids could have had more thought put into it, but at least, as shown in the prelude to the climax, it's a development treated with weight when it could have easily been perfunctory. But my biggest reservation is how Syndrome is dispatched. I, for one, would have found it more satisfying for the Parrs to coordinate their powers to defeat this guy in a direct fight, rather than just having him undone by an (admittedly funny) wardrobe malfunction. But, these defects are ultimately of little consequence. 'The Incredibles' is a fine and intelligent animated feature, and one of the few from the pertinent animation studio that is fruitful for a continuation.",8,0,0,8 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Thematically misguided sequel that works better on its own terms than as part of a larger tale.
","'The Last Jedi' is a surprising film, and a disheartening one. Surprising for its willingness to shake the status quo, and disheartening for how it nearly turns Star Wars into a series at war with itself. Surprising for the poignancy it clearly aspires to, and disheartening for casually discarding the goodwill garnered by its predecessor. It doesn't destroy Star Wars, contrary to some reports, and manages to avoid a far worse trajectory towards the end, but nonetheless left me with the dashed hope that we would ever get a non-polarizing installment. 'The Last Jedi' essentially sapped my enthusiasm for the sequel trilogy.
Episode VIII doesn't feel very much like a Star Wars movie. The dominant feeling of hopelessness and despair isn't inappropriate, but it is excessive and, frankly, premature. No room is allowed for build-up before we are thrust into a dire situation. Purely in terms of the action, this is unquestionably the franchise's weakest outing; none of the scant fights or battles are exceptionally exciting. Even the much lauded duel between two primary characters and a bunch of First Order lackeys feels more disorganized than thrilling. What's more, the inordinately widespread notion on the true worth of one-on-one confrontations may have also gotten to the director; apparently, the least important aspect of a fight here is the actual fighting. How else to explain the dramatic and unexpected, but anticlimactic, climax?
Rian Johnson was clearly more concerned with giving the series a thematic overhaul than crafting a compelling narrative, and it's this prioritization that nearly defeats the film. 'The Last Jedi' is carefully constructed to affirm or voice the numerous complaints fans, authors, and online commentators have thrown about for years; resultingly the film denounces or rejects aspects of the mythos from previous entries rather than expand the horizons of the franchise. Why Lucasfilm assigned the director his own trilogy following the sheer cynicism on display here is beyond me.
Consider Luke's heavy-handed criticism of the Jedi, with his use of words such as 'hypocrisy', 'hubris', and 'romanticized'. Admittedly, the subsequent themes on his personal legacy, the impact of legends, and dealing with errors are worthy ones that lead to some strong developments. But, their faults in the films notwithstanding, the Jedi are a cornerstone of the Star Wars narrative, and the film's unabashedly negative stance towards them is a strident misstep. Never mind the irony on display. For a film that practically boasts of getting the series to grow-up, it has no problem making the immature claim that a millennia old religion's worth is defined by the (generalized) failings of one generation. Rian Johnson had the opportunity to better define and examine this fictional group's history and practices, imperfections and merit. Not only would this have been a bolder route, it might have decreased the gulf in the fandom. Instead, he opted for an approach that sustains some inflammatory commentaries while scolding prequel fans for having become invested at all, delivering some collateral damage to the original trilogy as well (try re-watching those movies knowing THIS is where it's all headed). This isn't just poor business-sense, it's an affront.
Another criticism worked into the narrative is that Star Wars has devolved into an elitist fantasy that promotes 'royal bloodlines' and 'disdain for common folk', which, for reasons beyond the scope of this essay, is a gross exaggeration. But Johnson seems to agree with it, and thus we have Luke talking derisively about 'Skywalker blood', the idealistic Rey having an insignificant lineage, and several self-conscious, yet perfunctory, scenes focusing on loyal/heroic Resistance fighters just before dying. Unfortunately, much of this comes across as shallow overcompensation. For example, the notion that the Force 'doesn't belong to the Jedi', which should be clear from earlier descriptions and moments, isn't expanded upon in any meaningful way beyond stern lecturing. It's also ironic that, despite the clear aim of highlighting the downsides of 'demigods' and heroism of 'common folk', the most consistently compelling individuals in the movie are all 'demigods'; it's the 'common folk' that water down the experience, plagued by drabness and half-baked characterization. And the less said about that groan-inducing epilogue, the better.
Gripes on the thematic level aside, the movie fares decently as an entertainment, something I conceded to on the second viewing. First and foremost, Mark Hamill's performance as an aged Luke is excellent, capturing the right mix of world-weariness, remorse, and, surprisingly, humor. He's actually the funniest person in the movie, and the recollection of a key action serves as one of the dramatic high-points. It's also appreciable that someone found a good niche for Kylo Ren as a direct foil for Rey. Their interplay is consistently engaging, though when left to his own devices it's a different story. True to his word, Rian Johnson included several unexpected turns. While there are no Earth-shattering revelations on par with that of Episode V, the legitimate surprises provide a good jolt when needed.
Adherents of 'The Last Jedi' will no doubt sustain Johnson's vision as a necessary course-correction, an antidote to Lucas' approach to mythmaking. But in my experience there's a significant dissonance between the disturbing implications people have extracted from the setting and the actual effects of the movies themselves (a pattern depressingly similar to the nigh-worthless genre deconstructions that have gained traction since the work of Alan Moore). Addressing a few straw-man arguments is a poor reason for casting a gloomy cloud over elements that function finely within the fairy tale parameters of the series. Star Wars will not become greater by mechanically subverting or criticizing its own conventions. Disney seems to have made a habit of this to modernize its latest animations, but have any of these even approached the likes of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'? Whatever missteps Star Wars has seen during its history, it has achieved greatness through its original direction, and I hazard that it will never reach that caliber again.",6,5,6,30 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Short on originality, but made with enough quality to be encouraging
","After much reluctance, I have decided to present my basic thoughts on the much anticipated (and polarizing) new installment of 'Star Wars'. I'm not going to go through any formalities or introductions for this franchise or its cultural impact, nor should I have to. Anyone reading this should have a sufficient understanding of such things. The fundamental question on the minds of the masses is whether 'The Force Awakens' succeeds as the initiatory chapter in a new story, and for me the answer is, mostly, 'yes'.It's apparent that Abrams and the rest of the staff had the goal in mind to recapture the feel of the original movies, resulting in a narrative that borrows significantly from the past. Oh, the story is told well enough in and of itself. It moves on a smooth, uninterrupted trajectory, justifies its numerous introductions and accomplishes them with efficiency. The issue is there are simply too many recycled plot points and, though tweaked enough to distinguish themselves, they largely fail to improve upon what came before. Consider the Starkiller base. In spite of its size and unprecedented firepower, it's less impressive than the Death Star. I think that's because the original battle station was presented so well in 'A New Hope'. The sense of awe and fear from the heroes was palpable, the villains' confidence in it convincing, and the place felt so expansive; it almost became a character itself. The biggest argument against these story decisions is the aesthetic. Though a good case can be made that this is not the best movie of the year, it's definitely the best looking. No other 2015 release, from 'Age of Ultron', to 'Jurassic World', to 'Fury Road' boasts such impressive visuals. The CGI Millennium Falcon is especially terrific, and the ruins of a fallen star destroyer are marvelous. From beginning to end, this movie looks exactly as we would expect: a sleeker version of the world in the original trilogy. These technical accomplishments are sufficient to sell the feel of a 'Star Wars' movie, rendering the familiar plot beats unnecessary. Even so, by placing much of the focus on the smaller stories of truly new elements, 'The Force Awakens' mitigates the negative impact of its uninspired backdrop. Through it all, there are some very promising analogs. Maz Kanata is a curious new creature that suggests Yoda without imitating him. The same essentially goes for the dynamic between Kylo Ren and General Hux, which is this film's obvious version of the Vader/Tarkin duo. It's underplayed, but the uneasy alliance between these two stands in contrast to their predecessors' cooperativeness. One thing that's pretty unanimous is that the new heroes are welcome additions. Like in 'The Phantom Menace', they share a sense of inexperience, the key difference being that their personalities are endearing and better drawn. There's little by way of actual dramatic arcs, but that's acceptable in an introductory chapter, and the same was largely true of the original 'Star Wars' anyway. What we do get is progress in individual histories and backgrounds that lend dimension, a promising foundation for future developments. There's also an interesting parallel between Rey and Finn, who are both essentially orphans, one desiring to belong and the other needing a new purpose. I do agree that her near-immediate picking up of Force abilities strains credulity, but, considering what we know about the Force, her instinctive piloting of the Millennium Falcon is acceptable. Surprisingly, the film's sense of humor has been quite under-appreciated amongst audiences. Sure, the in-jokes get tiresome quickly, but this is arguably the first entry in the series since 'Empire' to successfully derive wit and humor from character interactions.Kylo Ren, on the other hand, is a misfire. One thing I will readily concede to is that he's not lacking for substance. His motivations, vulnerabilities and history are clear, painting an individual who chose a darker path out of insecurity and self-loathing, both of which he is still hindered by. There's some good material here, but the screenplay's approach is what derails everything. Rather than manifesting or exploring these aspects of his character with restraint, his shortcomings are hamfistedly presented as blunt insecurity. Combine this with temper tantrums played for humor and a string of embarrassing defeats following the first removal of his helmet, and you get a villain practically stripped of menace and dignity that undermines the unsettling quality of the dark side established by the previous six films. Compare Zuko from 'Avatar', whose self-doubt manifested as despair and weariness, and was often counteracted by dignity, discipline and determination. As far as action goes, it's nothing extraordinary, but the refreshing look goes a long way towards making things captivating. It's interesting how big a role the settings play. The chase with the Millennium Falcon is exhilarating largely due to passing through a fallen Star Destroyer, and the traditional lightsaber duel has a great, atmospheric location. Even so, the duel itself is too crude to work. Sure, the sound work is first rate and combatants get wounded more frequently than normal (particularly Finn receiving a nasty slash), but the bladework lacks kineticism or the impression of skilled swordsman, and the result is what fans have been inadvertently clamoring for: a polished clubbing match between two 12 year olds. The humble thrills from the original trilogy simply don't fit into this modern age. So, how does it hold up in its own line? Oddly enough, it lands in the middle. It's marginally better than Episode II, but lacks the sheer ingenuity of Episode IV and the mythic quality of Episodes V and III. Even so, for all its missteps, 'The Force Awakens' is entertaining and made with enough feeling to get one primed for the next chapter.",7,5,27,2 January 2016
Godzilla," Well made and shows great promise for the future, but suffers from curious defects
","Watching Godzilla (2014) for the fifth time, I was surprised by how consistent the trend of new observations has been with each repeat viewing. I don't say this to uphold the movie as a particularly deep piece of work; even I wouldn't go that far. It's simply to observe that, for a summer blockbuster, the nuclear menace's modern update boasts a surprising amount of re-watch value.If there's anything I've had to ask myself for the last year, it's WHY did it have to be THIS film that suffered from universally recognized missteps? I was never too driven to discuss them at length because many, MANY others had already done that dirty work. The lamentation from this latest viewing has changed that, the operative word being 'lamentation', not frustration. Much of the basis for this resides in the first half-hour, before the uncalled for death of the most interesting character. Yes, killing off Bryan Cranston's character was a mistake, because not only did he churn out the best performance; he was also personally affected by the existence of these giant monsters, a trait that bolsters many of the better entries in this genre. Yet, lost opportunities within this first segment of the movie extend beyond that, such that I would argue that the movie wasn't necessarily lost without him.Consider the scenes with Ford and Elle Brody. They're certainly conventional as far as portraying the affection within a marriage, but it works, and it's the kind of stuff that the Godzilla series has been devoid of from the start. Had these two been allowed to interact more, this could have been an interesting illustration of spouses strengthening each other during a time of crisis. In fact, other notable relationships are established in the first half-hour. The scenes with Joe and Ford demonstrate a convincing father/son dynamic, within the context of great personal loss. Heck, with that loss we already have a motivation for Ford, who was effectively robbed of BOTH parents by these creatures. There's so much to be admired in this part of the movie, and so much to lament because so little of it carried over to the rest. That first half-hour is such a good basis for a monster movie that, even without Cranston's character, had there been follow-through 'Godzilla (2014)' would have approached the upper echelons of the genre.The middle act is choppy in comparison. It doesn't concern itself with any central character and often scrambles about trying to explain everything. That being said, the exposition is interesting, especially since the monster threat is constant. More concern is evident for simply making these people vanilla flavored good guys, which teeters between uninteresting and annoying. The military is particularly groan-inducing; I guess it's an unspoken rule in these movies that members of the military are incompetent or pompous. Admiral Stenz has presence, though, and Serizawa seems genuinely fascinated by the situation. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing them in the sequels.All that aside, the ultimate triumph of the movie are the monsters themselves. From a technical standpoint, these are perhaps the best portrayals of giant monsters to date, and the one thing that carries over from the first act. The sense of scale is undeniable. Even the male MUTO, a shrimp by giant monster standards, feels bigger than most of the kaiju from 'Pacific Rim'. On top of that, just about every scene that these things appear in is atmospheric and tense. Consider the scene on the railroad bridge, where the female MUTO easily towers over the man made structure. Say what you will about Gareth Edwards' slow burn approach, but the guy knows how to give the impression of actually encountering one of these things.As for the main attraction himself, it would feel redundant to affirm the sheer magnificence Godzilla is infused with. His presence is lacking for the first 40 minutes or so, but it does steadily increase. We first glimpse him in the (very good) opening credits, later learn more about him from the researchers, see his first full-fledged appearance that is excellently built up to, and finally he shows up for the climax. Echoing practically the rest of the world, I would have preferred for the movie to focus more on him, but every second he is on screen is nothing short of astounding. The increased bulk and longer tail complement each other well, while the mouth grants a more reptilian, almost snake-like appearance. Other welcome tweaks include the spines glowing in segments, which is a marvelous sight, and hints of intelligence, evident from his avoidance of the aircraft carriers and the innovative finishing strike. Perhaps most notable is the reinvention of Godzilla's image as the force of nature that maintains balance. It has a relative reverence that allows him to be a hero without becoming cheesy, and may prove fruitful for later exploration regarding humanity's opinions of him.Allow me a second to comment on one of the more understated technical aspects: the sound design. As all six of the Star Wars films have demonstrated, visuals are at their best when complemented by the right sound, and that is consistently done here. Godzilla's classic roar has received a fittingly teeth-shaking update, while the MUTO are both given a unique and versatile roar that is their best feature. One might say that these help give the monsters distinct 'personalities'. Other sounds, such as the EMP attack and the whirring that accompanies the glowing spines, are also effective.This is a good new start for the King of the Monsters, and one of the better blockbusters of the previous summer (second to 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'). The doors are open for such developments as a more complex relationship between monster and human or the capacity that crisis has to divide individuals or unite them. That is what I hope the next film will be about.",7,0,2,28 August 2015
