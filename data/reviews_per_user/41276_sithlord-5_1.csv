Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't Listen to me listen to them
","I've seen the phantom menace 4 times now and being a die hard star wars fan I really do think it is just as good as any of the other films. But I didn't really look at myself as being unbiased I took 2 of my nephews to see the movie. They actually have never seen the trilogy (well not until after they saw this move) and being 5 and 6 I knew that if the movie was really as mediocre as everyone else wants to think it is they would tell me. Well low and behold I was wrong. They sat enchanted for all 2 1/2 hours of the phantom menace. I guess to sum up my point here is you can debate the quality, the accuracy, the acting all you want. My belief is that some people were going to believe that this movie was going to be a boom and some thought a bust and really the movie could have been the greatest thing ever and the people who thought it was going to be a bust were going to say that it was sub-par anyway and likewise the movie could have been horrible and the people who thought it was going to be a boom would have made it a cult movie. So I listend to my objective observers and blocked out everyone who wanted to see the movie fail or succeed and now I have 2 nephews to talk star wars with.",10,0,1,10 October 1999
