The Lobster," He'd Be Better Off as a Lobster
","A very good cast in a ridiculous film. There's no point, no plot, no character development, no rhyme or reason for much of anything.",2,3,5,18 December 2018
Blade Runner 2049," 'Just a Piece of the Puzzle'
","Overrated. Too long. At times disjointed. Loses it purpose several times in the beginning, in the middle, and toward the end. It is easy to get bored and lose the continuity of the story. Only watch this if you really like this type of fiction.",3,0,2,10 March 2019
Wind River," Murder In Wyoming
","A murder of a young girl with an easy solution. Well, not really. It took place on an Indian Reservation which made it a little more complicated.",6,1,3,7 March 2018
Darkest Hour," Excellent Performance
",Could be Oldman's best performance. Great script performed superbly by the entire cast.,9,4,10,20 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," If You've Seen One, You've Seen Them All
","A rewrite of Star Wars Episode 4, the first Star Wars feature. Same script, different actors. Was completely disappointed in the script and the acting.",5,1,2,30 January 2018
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Kind of Silly, But Funny
","A kind of raunchy story of a 'famous' TV star and her boyfriend who break up and then accidentally vacation at the same hotel in Hawaii, her with her new boyfriend, he alone, to lament his break up. They get together again as her boyfriend leaves, but, it doesn't last as he has found someone else. Funny but nonsensical and many unnecessary references to sexual activity.",4,0,2,6 March 2018
Last Flag Flying," Well Done, 'Remembering Viet Nam'
","Three good actors telling a good story of remembrance of times when they were bad and times when they were good. Enjoyable, smooth, quiet and subtle impact.",7,1,3,14 May 2018
The Fifth Element," Mars Attacks, but Worse
","The film so ridiculous it was difficult to stop watching it. Worse than 'Mars Attacks,' and that was really bad.",2,0,8,25 May 2019
"I Love You, Man"," Disappointment
",Tons of unnecessary foul language. I think the film is a comedy but widely misses the mark. Disappointed given the cast.,2,0,6,19 September 2018
Spotlight," Finding Facts Is Hard Work
","'Spotlight' details the people, methods, and investigative processes surrounding a newspaper's desire to expose, detail, and reveal the molestation of children by Catholic priests in the Boston, MA area in the 1970s. The value of the film demonstrates the procedures and policies that true investigative reporters will follow in order to find facts that can be revealed in order to assure accuracy that cannot be mitigated. It's hard work, classifying, categorizing, detailing, fact-checking, and memorizing real-time and historical information just to write an exposÃ© that overcomes 'just-to-sell newspapers' column. A film well worth viewing.",8,0,0,10 March 2018
The Way Back," Wasn't There a Shortcut?
",Films based on true stories seem to work well. This is one of them.;,7,0,0,7 April 2018
Bird Box," Follow the River
","An apocalyptic film not unlike WORLD WAR Z and QUIET PLACE but with a different twist. Sandra Bullock does a credible job in her role, although the premise is a little bizarre in that the film never discloses exactly what the source of the problem might be. It's worth viewing.",6,1,4,22 December 2018
Split," The Beast
",Very good thriller with McAvoy playing a man with multiple personalities. The acting by McAvoy is excellent with the Shyamalan script and the combination of the two makes this piece almost believable.,6,0,1,20 February 2018
Wanted," Luke... I Am Your Father
","Super fantastic group of assassins recruit the son of one of them to kill one of them. Maybe Angelina Jolie just likes to dominate men. Maybe Morgan Freeman can actually make a bad movie. It's not a comedy, but you'll want to laugh at some of the fantastic, futuristic, unbelievable activities conducted by The Fraternity.",3,1,5,5 June 2018
Get Out," Take It or Leave It
","Psychotic, strange, at times unbelievable, improbable, and bizarre. Take it or leave it.",5,7,10,20 May 2018
Peaceful Warrior," No Guts No Glory
","'The Karate Kid,' 'Rocky,' 'Rudy,' and similar films provide the untimely story of overcoming fear and believing in your own capabilities that lead to success and inner happiness summarizes this screenplay. You'll have to be a fan of gymnastics to enjoy this interpretation of guts to glory.",6,0,1,20 August 2018
Stardust," Less Than Expected
","Sorry. Can't rate this fairy tale very highly. Corny, silly, pointless.",4,0,7,16 January 2018
Into the Wild," The Mistakes of Youth
","A film with three viewpoints. The narration by the sister of 'Alexander Supertramp,' (the character of Christopher McCandless played by Emile Hirsch), the Supertramp himself, and the unspoken perspective of the Supertramp's parents.The story: A disillusioned, intelligent college graduate realizes that he can not tolerate 'society.' As a result, he decides to dump his money, dump his car, and travel, as a tramp, losing himself by looking for himself. He heads, in a round-about-way, for Alaska where he can live alone.Supertramp's sister provides various narrations throughout the film trying to understand why he disappeared as he did -- and gets it -- after reflecting on their family life together.Not examined is the parental perspective -- worried and concerned -- at times fearing that Chris is dead, but not wanting to bear the fact that he wanted to disappear and they are or were at least partly to blame.While the film is enjoyable as we follow the adventures of Chris, it is unbearable to see this story from the parent's mindset. Chris is selfish, self-centered, and immature, and never thinks of how his parents may feel not knowing whether Chris is dead or alive, suffering somewhere alone, hungry or sick.Chris makes some mistakes living alone which eventually kills him -- wasting his life, devastating his parents and causing a great deal of sorrow for his sister.",6,2,2,16 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Yes, Watch This
","A comedy, yes. Can James Franco act? He really can. Does Dave Franco look like James Dean? Yes. Dave needs to make more movies... you should like him in this somewhat ridiculous movie. Did I say this was a comedy? There are several laughs every few minutes. Fun film. I give both Francos an Oscar nomination.",7,0,0,29 July 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," In the Spirit of Waiting for Guffman
","Silly, unusual, quirky, delightful. I almost quit watching it after a few minutes, but was glad I did not.",6,0,0,28 July 2018
Green Book," Just Watch It, It's Worth It
","Can't say anything other than, 'must-see.' But, I will. If you want to compare and come to some conclusion that some things have changed in the last 50 years regarding race relations, there are some parts of this story will help you with this issue.",10,1,2,21 December 2019
The Runaways," The Life and Times of an All Girl Band
",Fanning and Stewart wasted on this almost-biopic... in more ways than one. If you like a life of chaos you might like this story. Gee how I'd like to be a musician.,5,0,0,17 May 2020
