Despicable Me 2," Move aside, Pixar. We've got our animated film of the summer.
","Move aside, Pixar. We've got our animated film of the summer. The less-despicable- more- lovable sequel provides non-stop laughs from start to finish all the while maintaining the wit and charm of the original.In the sequel to 2010s unexpected success that was Despicable Me we find our former baddie Gru (Steve Carrel) living the single dad life, more focused now on his jam/jelly business and making sure the fairy princess shows up to Agnes' birthday party rather than freeze rays - though he does hold onto his villainous past. It's not too long into the film before Lucy (Kristen Wiig) unwillingly drags Gru to the headquarters of an organization known as the AVL (Anti- Villain League) where he is asked to use his expertise as a villain to track down a new bad guy who has stolen a top secret liquid that turns any creature into a mindless, indestructible killing machine.As much as the plot takes its time getting to, the story ultimately here is Gru finding love; this time in that of a woman. Between the constant set-ups by his neighbor and some flashbacks of his childhood we get the idea that Gru isn't really good with women. Throw in a girl like Lucy that's just as wacky as him and we've got an interesting love story.The film does a great job introducing new characters and gadgets yet still referencing enough from the first film for the audience to ease into the changes. Just like the original film the amount of physical comedy is off the charts, it's really what differentiated it from the other animated films. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of dialogue–based humor but there is also consistent slapstick style comedy happening throughout the film like a repeated montage, one of Gru giddy with love and the other dismal with heartbreak. This is also the best use of repetition I've seen all year, constant running gags some of which are still running from the first one.One running gag I'm sure the studio didn't expect to have the impact it did was the Minions. Those little pill-shaped babblers were crowd favorites in the original and are now back and bigger than ever. They receive just as much screen time as any of the other major characters and succeed at being tremendously hilarious both off-screen and on-screen. While there isn't much to quote from (mostly because they don't speak English) it's fair to say they make the whole movie.The voice work is great; Steve and Kristen both have great unique tics in their voices, which the animators played off of extremely well. It was nice to see Russell Brand return as Dr. Nefario as well, a voice that has always astounded me, being so far different from his natural one. Steve's is clearly different as well but it's quite easy pick out verbal cues.Despicable Me 2 is enjoyable on so many levels, it does a good job of giving the adult audience plenty of shout-outs and still being kid-friendly. Tons of euphemisms I'm sure kids won't understand but the adult humor is almost always delivered along with a piece of slapstick for the kids so no one in the audience ever feels left out.Despicable Me 2 is one of the most anticipated movies this Summer and it has lived up to the hype. The plot is rather predictable but there are enough surprises to keep people intrigued. It has its heartfelt moments with the kids, and with some of the new characters but what makes this run smoothly from beginning to end are the Minions and their ridiculous antics. They'll have you crying with laughter from the opening scene to the sequence during the credits. While being far from despicable, Despicable Me 2 is just as much fun as the original.Our Rating: 8.0/10Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of Despicable Me 2!",8,7,14,3 July 2013
This Is the End," This isn't just one of the best comedies I've ever seen but one of the best disaster movies as well.
","That's right, the most outrageous movie of the summer that has comedians playing themselves in an over the top end of the world scenario that's made up of at least 30% dick jokes, manages to be one of smartest, most heartfelt comedies to come out in years. This isn't just one of the best comedies I've ever seen but one of the best disaster movies as well. What could possibly test friendship better than the apocalypse?This is one of those films that's so ridiculous on the surface it's bound to cause walkouts all across the country as well people who will consider this film merely a guilty pleasure. It's unfortunate that this is the case because if you can look beyond This Is The End's shocking exterior you can see a true story of friendship and morality.The greatest thing about This Is The End is even though they present us with so many different types of humor going on within each form, whether it is in the acting, writing or editing they have a way of hitting their mark and quickly moving on to the next one. Even if you're aware of where the joke is going they hit you with the punch line a second sooner than you're expecting; this makes even the predictable gags unpredictable.The main thing I was worried about in this movie was the story. The trailer sold me on the comedy, I knew it would be funny but the story was going to going to make or break it. The apocalypse isn't just a gag in the film it really is a disaster movie; so with the end of the world taken seriously the comedy can latch onto the plot and take off in all directions.I know it seems ridiculous to suggest there is good acting in a movie where all the actors are playing exaggerated versions of themselves but I'm going to do it anyway. It's hard to differentiate in a piece like this how much was written vs. how much improvised however the amount that at least appeared improvised was very impressive. A prime example of this is when James Franco is upset about Danny McBride's poor handling of his porno magazine; the dialogue back and forth is so outrageous and immature that initially I was surprised the scene made it in the film and then it just goes on and on and the pacing makes it all the funnier. If you watch closely there's a shot during the scene that's over the shoulders of Danny and Seth and you can see Seth turn away from the actors and laughing. If you can make Seth Rogen laugh at his own movie you're doing something right.Through all the hilarity that takes place in This Is The End, never for a second does it forget what it's trying to show us. The moral of the film is strangely religious and the answer they give us in solving all the pain and suffering in the world will take you into heaven dying with laughter.Visit http://themoviebloggers.com/ for more reviews.",8,6,20,15 June 2013
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim is a stunning mindless action film, but in the end that's all it is; a mindless action film.
","Words could not describe how excited I was for Pacific Rim. Yes, it was a blockbuster about giant robots fighting giant monsters, but between Del Toro directing and all the early praise it was receiving from critics and filmmakers alike I went into the early screening extremely giddy. I'm sorry to say I didn't leave the theatre with the same enthusiasm.In 2013 a wormhole known as 'The Breach' connected our world with another, letting monsters known as 'Kaiju' invade earth. Millions of people were killed and entire cities were levelled After years of defeat in the war against the Kaiju the governments of the world joined together and developed 'Jaegers', giant fighting robots sort of Mighty Morphing Power Rangers meets Gundam. We pick up in the year 2025 with the Jaeger program failing as bigger and deadlier Kaiju are coming out of the Breach. With not much time left the governments call together the last of the Jaegers for one last final showdown in Hong Kong.I really wanted to like this movie. In fact I wanted to love it but I didn't. For the opening 30 minutes I was really into it, the quick news flash wrap up of the Kaijus first landing and the invention of Jaegers led me to believe this movie was going in a different direction than the trailer showed and I deeply wanted it to. Since there was so much praise for this film, there had to be more to it, right?There wasn't. Everything plot-wise was given away in the trailer. The only thing that trailer didn't show was the bad dialogue and over-the-top acting (arguable). There is lots of intentional comedy, which worked fine, but the rest was the bad kind of cheesy; the kind where you can't tell if they made a mistake or not. While I'm sure people are going to tell me it was intentional I can't say that it being intentional really makes it better in this case. I'm a huge fan of that meta/self-aware style but only when they use it to say something, to drive their theme or message home and I can assure you the overall message in Pacific Rim was not driven forward by ironic poorly delivered dialogue.Despite the overall negative tone of this review I actually ended up having plenty of fun with the film and I will say that it is an awesome monster movie. The overall production was quite a marvel to watch. The visuals are breathtaking and the soundtrack/sound design compliments the visuals masterfully. There is no doubt that Del Toro has left his visual signature all over this film. The soundtrack wasn't a bunch of dubstep noises either, which was one of my only concerns going into the film originally. There was actual score and it built up the emotion of the scenes better than most of the actors did. I would say that this film is highly enjoyable,as long as you don't go in expecting more - which I will admit is difficult if you've read any early discussions on the film.I put most of the blame on myself. I'm sure if I didn't hype this movie, and didn't read all the early praises I would have had a much better time with it. That's why I'm giving this film a decent rating, since I firmly believe it's my fault for not being in the right state of mind. The way people were reacting made me expect that this would be more than the trailer, more depth to it, you know? Pacific Rim is a stunning mindless action film, but in the end that's all it is; a mindless action film. I guess it's my fault for expecting more.I can't stress how much I wanted to love this film enough. I REALLY love Guillermo's work however this just didn't do it for me. I'm sure this movie will find its audience and I'm also sure my review will get ripped apart by his fans. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it again in a different mindset. I think I'll like it more the second time. Our Rating: 7.0/10Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of Pacific Rim!More reviews at themoviebloggers.com.",7,27,49,11 July 2013
Man of Steel," Sorry, but aren't you going to take us on a date first Mr. Cavill?
","It's hard to dislike 'Man Of Steel' because it does so many things right; however everything about this film screams LAZY. It's sad because clearly a lot of thought went into the story and I just wish the same amount of thought had went into the overall execution of the film.The opening 20 minutes was unexpected and refreshing. Similar to 'Batman Begins', quickly we're introduced to a story we've never really seen on screen before - the struggling Krypton. We get a well-paced introduction to why Kal-El is sent to us and how important he really is. However after the opening scene the rest of the film is paced horribly. We see Clark grow up in the laziest sequence of flashbacks you could possibly imagine and we spend WAY too much time on redundant story aspects while skipping over things that should have been deemed important. Unfortunately due to the pacing with getting to know Clark, by the time we feel we're starting to understand who he is he's handed (that's right literally handed) his suit already pimped out in blue and red and literally seconds later we're flying space with the dude. Sorry, but aren't you going to take us on a date first Mr. Cavill?As much as we do get to see Clark through the years we don't really see him grow up. We don't see him transition into Superman which is what I was most excited for. They hammered into our skulls that this was 'Superman as you've never seen him before' which I interpreted as lots of Superman not in the suit; more of a Clark Kent character study but this is not the case. This film is just as generic and cliché as the filmmakers told us it wouldn't be. It's not necessarily a bad thing, since I find Superman to be the most generic/cliché superhero to exist it actually seems rather fitting; also they do deliver it to us in an interesting way, so don't read this as entirely negative.The most distracting thing about this movie is the way it was shot. There is a lot of consistent shaky cam throughout the film to bring this sense of realism to the story. I'm not sure which filmmaker thought this hand-held/camcorder style shooting was pleasing to the eye because it's certainly not. There are, at least what appeared to be, well choreographed fight sequences but you can't see any of it. I understand a bit of shaky cam during an action scene but this film had it when people were talking, or walking and even just to look at things. The film was also shot very dark. I don't know why but I've noticed it a lot in these large production recently that they love making it just bright enough for you to kind of make out what's there. Even during the day scenes I found myself constantly taking my 3D glasses off to get a better look at the screen. On that note I beg you guys to watch it in 2D. There are quite a few films I have enjoyed in 3D and this was not one of them. If you are interested in actually seeing what's on the screen you'll have enough difficulty with the shaky cam and dim lighting; the glasses just make it even worse.The music was the only thing holding the tone of the film together. Zimmer knows exactly when subtlety is needed and when he needs to bring it loud. Having to follow up John Williams' masterful score seemed next to impossible, yet when I was leaving the theatre it was the only thing I could hear for the next few hours. Bravo.I've heard a lot of complaint over the action sequences so maybe my low expectations of them were the reason I enjoyed them. While I feel at least one of the major fight sequences needed to be cut from the film and the fights were essentially just Superman and the bad guys taking turns throwing each other through buildings, I would feel bad complaining that there was too much action in a superhero movie There's just something so anti-climactic about these seemingly immortal beings throwing each other around for 45 minutes.I found it rather difficult to relate to any of the characters but there's no question that actors are what bring this film to life. I was worried about Henry Cavill originally but the guy was great. As many of his cast members have said 'he IS Superman'. He looks, sounds and acts the part. Michael Shannon (who I absolutely adore) is our antagonist General Zod and he delivers this intimidating military leader that you almost sympathize with. I loved that the movie wasn't just about good vs. evil, there was this grey line of right and wrong and Shannon brings that out in his performance. However all the feels go to Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe who both play wonderful fathers willing to do anything for their son. They both stole the screen every time they were on it and it a pleasant treat to see how much screen time was given to both of them. Laurence Fishburne, Amy Adams, Antje Traue and Christopher Meloni all do fine in their respective roles but I found most of them highly under-used. Perhaps in the already scheduled sequel when (spoiler alert?) Clark is working at the Daily Planet we'll get more out of them. That'd be nice.While the film is wickedly entertaining the story is a little too cliché, the action is a little too over the top and there is WAY too much shaky cam for me to find it great. If they had cut an action sequence and replaced it with more Clark Kent transitioning into Superman this film would have been extremely enjoyable.More reviews at themoviebloggers.com",4,0,0,14 June 2013
Evil Dead," Horror filmmakers better be taking notes - this is how a remake is done folks
","This gut wrenching, blood-soaked remake pays it dues to the source material, managing to pleasantly surprise the die-hard fans of the original trilogy while establishing its own identity for newcomers to the franchise; a true homage to the 1981 cult classic. Horror filmmakers better be taking notes because this is how a remake is done folks.Obviously the film differs significantly in plot from original. Consider this a 'rebirth' rather than a 'remake'. As I'm sure you're all aware the film focuses on a young girl named Mia (Jane Levy) who takes a trip to her families old cabin for a drug intervention, bringing together old friends and her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) to help her through it. Mia's loved ones swear to each other no matter how bad things get they won't let her relapse again and it's not long before all hell breaks loose when her friend Eric uncovers the 'Book of the Dead' and reads a passage from it. The demon quickly latches onto the first soul it can find (Mia) and then the fun begins. The set up is actually extremely clever. So when Mia starts telling stories about there being 'something' in the woods the others all brush it off as a drug addict hallucination. The demon quickly takes over Mia and makes a promise to everyone that they are all going to die that very night. It's as much a promise to the audience as it is the cast. Next we have 60 minutes of nail guns, chainsaws, turkey cutters, mirror shards and needles all being used as you can imagine. It's the most rated R fun you'll have all year.Director Fede Alvarez doesn't let us down, he makes the cast go all out doing indescribable acts of violence to one another, each actor out doing the next pushing the R rating as far as it could possibly go. He also keeps the overall tone serious which only falls short for a bit before the climactic scene. the climactic scene being the best thing I've ever seen in a horror film.The actors all do a decent job with the occasional poor line delivery - which I read as intentional comedy. One thing they all manage to really do well is cry out in pain. A strange talent however I couldn't believe how much of a difference the actors made to the violent imagery. They all had very convincing performances as kids getting sliced and diced by one another. Jane Levy stands out being consistently good throughout the entirety of the film – you'll be sure to see her in other things after this.The cinematography was interesting to say the least with odd lighting choices and even weirder camera angles, which at first I didn't like but it quickly grew on me. I was really glad the 'Raimi- cam' (which I just refer to as just the Demon POV shots) were back and better than ever. That being one of many throwbacks to the originals just one I thought was worth mentioning. Unfortunately the score was rather forgettable but for everything they lack in music they gain in sound design. If you're someone who closes their eyes to avoid gore you will have no luck here, the sound effects are so good you're going to have trouble not imagining what's happening on screen with such convincing noises of bone's crushing and skin peeling. The FX in general are probably this films greatest success. Going back to the old fashion way of things and using make-up/prosthetics really shows the talent in such a CGI heavy industry today.The film does a great job of pleasing its targeted audience however don't go into the film expecting to be terribly frightened. It's really not a very scary film, although I never found the original very scary either so I don't see this as a negative aspect. I know there have been lots of complaints about how the film isn't scary but I was glad to see so few jumps scares in a horror flick and to be honest the idea of close friends becoming demons and torturing you to death is scary enough for me.Beware though, this film is not for the faint of heart. When I say that they pushed the R rating as far as it could go I mean I don't understand how this film actually managed a theatrical release. It had everything you would see in an NC-17 film. If the idea of gore makes you uneasy, pass on this film.Evil Dead is a great remake to a great cult classic and I suggest anyone who is a fan of the horror genre to check it out.7/10*Also if you are one of the die-hard fans mentioned earlier make sure to the stay after the credits. You won't be disappointed. Be sure to check out my review site: thejoshlreviews.com",7,11,53,6 April 2013
The Conjuring," With virtually no sex, no gore and no cursing The Conjuring earns its R-rating on scares alone.
","Who would've guessed that the director of Saw would end up being the most inventive horror filmmaker working in the industry? James Wan brilliantly takes us back to the retro days of horror, delivering an extremely stylistic, visually striking horror film that stands tall amongst the classics. With virtually no sex, no gore and no cursing The Conjuring earns its R-rating on scares alone.Set in 1971, The Conjuring focuses on the married paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren, who lecture at colleges across the US on all the interesting cases they come across. Just as they're thinking of retirement cue the Perron family; parents Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn (Lili Taylor) are scared for their lives and the lives of their 5 daughters claiming there is something evil in their now Rhode Island home. It doesn't take long for the Warrens to discover that the Perron's are being tormented by something supernatural, but what is it, and what does it want?In short: The Conjuring is the most terrifying film I've ever seen. Trying to erase his name from the 'torture porn' crowd has proved difficult for the director of Saw, however without a doubt he's finally done it. On looks alone this movie should be a PG movie, which would normally be frowned upon by the horror junkies, but despite having no sex, no gore and no swearing, James Wan's latest film has been slapped with an R rating anyway. If you're wondering how frightening it actually is I think the MPAA has spoken on its behalf.Most horror films these days climax somewhere in the middle; and in turn everything that follows doesn't really have the same affect. In The Conjuring there is comic relief brilliantly placed throughout to bring you down from your own climax so they get another chance to build your fear up and startle you again. Wan understands the psychology behind tension and builds suspense through mere scene construction.While obviously taking notes from the Exorcist and The Amityville Horror, the inspiration for this film derives from real case files from the Warren's, which is still their most famous case to date. Straying away from the ironic style made famous by The Cabin In The Woods, nothing on the surface of this story seems inventive, but I assure you the way in which this film works makes it one of the most creative films in recent memory. One thing I've always loved about James Wan is how he manages to take something so unoriginal, like the haunted-house- possession story in this case, and shows it to us like we've never seen it before.The scares, pacing, sound design and camera work can only be described as precise. Together James Wan and cinematographer John Leonetti (responsible for the look of Insidious as well) give us a fresh visual style that, unlike most horror films, include a lot of wide shots AND movement. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and not relying on shaky cam for its realism leaves a rather unique feel to the movie, separating it visually from any other movie you can narratively relate this to.One issue I've always had with recent films in the genre was that they revealed the demons too much. Insidious and Sinister are examples where they hooked me to the story and then showed me too much. Fear of the unknown is the greatest thing a horror filmmaker has on its audience and Wan has definitely learned from Insidious. In The Conjuring the apparitions aren't revealed to the audience until way late, and even then they're far away or out of focus. Letting us use our imagination is what makes this film truly horrifying, and I think horror filmmakers should be taking notes from Mr. Wan.This film is everything I wanted it to be and more, my only complaint about the movie isn't even something wrong with the film. Once again marketing has screwed us over and the trailer for The Conjuring reveals way too many of the scares. I avoided most of the trailers for this movie on command from James Wan's twitter account but it's hard to miss TV spots. I wish I went into this with a fresh mind so if you still haven't seen the trailer and want to see this film, please stay away from any of the marketing!Ultimately the overall production value allows The Conjuring to stand out in an otherwise rotting genre. The acting is impressive, the practical effects are perfect and the classic 70s feel Wan was going for make for a great time at the movies. This is the first must-see film of the summer.Our Rating: 9.0/10Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of The Conjuring!",9,542,687,17 July 2013
