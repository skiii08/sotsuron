The Hangover," The Funniest Movie ever
",Unbelievably Funny. Every Single time i watch this i laugh so hard. It has so many great one liners. It is very easy to re watch. I watched it 3 times in the week i first saw it and have watched it again recently. It's acting is not great but it isn't bad as the actors set out to do what they are meant to. This is the type of comedy i love. Todd Phillips is a good director other than this( Old School). All of it is just awesome. Zach Galiafinakis brings this movie to what it is. My Second favorite movie of all time. It's a shame about the crappy second one but even though that was a copy of this one. I would rather watch this exact copy of that kind of copy any day.,10,1,3,3 January 2013
The Dark Knight," Best movie
",This is my favorite movie for many reasons. I love superheroes and action. This does that plus is also a crime thriller which gives it its edge. Batman gets new light with this. The joker is played perfectly. My only complaint is about Maggie Gyllenhaal as she doesn't fit the role. This is one of the problems with this trilogy in general. They never really found Rachel Dawes. There are many great supporting actors. Heath Ledger's performance as the joker is not the best performance ever. Many other actors have better performances. There are people who say that the joker's character shouldn't be used again but it should.10/10,10,1,4,20 December 2012
