The Ring," A disturbing 'American' film
","I have to say that leading up to my viewing of 'The Ring', I was intrigued with the concept. I wasn't aware that it was an 'Americanization' of a Japanese film. So I went in with pretty much no ready made prejudices other than the fact that I am a huge horror fan and have been starving for something to push the envelope.What I got with 'The Ring' was an inkling of what current horror filmakers can do. I have a glimmer of hope that the old standard 'boos' will take a backseat to truly nightmarish and disturbing visuals. Yes the story is lacking a little (which I understand is explained a bit more in the Japanese sequels), but I think that revealing all to dummy it up for the audience is also insulting. So to all the snobs out there who are so willing to bash something because it has been 'Americanized', I think that you should look at it as a plus for those of us who may may not have heard of or seen the original, at least it is a start. To the rest of us enjoy something that will get under you skin and stay in your head for a bit.",Null,0,0,4 November 2002
