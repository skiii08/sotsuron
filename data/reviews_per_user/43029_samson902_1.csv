Requiem for a Dream," It will make you think twice about drugs, life and death.
","The film, i believe, is an in-depth analysis of the American dream, how one will go to all extremes, just to live it. This film is best described by the word Haunting. The supreme combination of audio, imagery and human emotion creates a movie experience unlike any other. The soundtrack is a must buy, I honestly have not been moved before by such quality music. The character emotions are so real that it hurts. There voices will ring in your head, long after you have seen the movie. Every character is sensational, no award can make it any better. The visual sequences that take place are also exceptional profound, giving drugs a new meaning. A true American classic.",10,0,1,5 May 2006
