Requiem for a Dream," Over-hyped and overwrought
","Had the moral complexity of an after-school special.  The usually great Ellen Burstyn overacts and makes an awful attempt at a Brooklyn accent, and the story is not remotely believable. I'm really at a loss why so many people loved this movie.",1,4,10,13 June 2003
