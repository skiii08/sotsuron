Requiem for a Dream," Another vote for best film of 2000
","Not only is this the best film of 2000, but it is one of my personal alltime favorites. Never before, and I do mean NEVER, have I left thetheatre so shaken......so moved! The performances are flawless,the direction and editing are assured and appropriate, and thesoundtrack........Let me tell you....the soundtrack is one of the finestever recorded for a film. There has been a lot of negativecomparisons to the 'MTV-like' quick editing and distorted lensestyles.....but where films like 'Charlie's Angels' use thesetechniques to be hip and not-too-boring.....'Requiem for a Dream'actually uses them to support the story and the 'hell-world' inwhich the characters live. Although this is not a typical 'horror' film, it incorporates manyhorror genre conventions that viewers will find unsettling and eventerrifying. As a horror movie fanatic it scared me more than anyHollywood horror film in recent memory.A definite 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,21 May 2001
The Descent," Overrated, practically shockless horror film that seems to have many fooled!
","Why has this film received such praise? Did I see a different film? Spoilers abound: The movie opens with a well constructed tragedy that sets an unsettling tone, which unfortunately, is ruined throughout the next half hour. What the audience is treated to is an insanely boring 'Night in with the gals' at a cabin that is supposed to help create three dimensional characters and sympathy for what is to follow. It produces yawns. In fact, I dozed off and awoke as the dimwits were descending into the hole. We are also introduced to the first of many dreamy sequences involving the main character's daughter that never go anywhere! Anyway, a hand is torn open by a rope and suddenly I think we're heading somewhere. Nope. But at least some suspense is building-I like suspense. I would have liked suspense 20 minutes earlier. Then a leg is broken. That sequence is single-handedly the film's best. Try not to squirm when her friend pushes the bone back in. Then a bunch of stupid monsters attack and the film goes down the toilet. At first, the creatures look creepy, but after the third time you see them, it's evident that they're really just GHOULIES (that haven't gone to college). Anyway, there is lots of blood and loud shock/jolt scares that would have been lambasted if in a Friday the 13th film, but seem to be highly praised in this 'monster' movie. I'm all for Monster Movies-we need more of them, but this film just didn't cut it. Too much of the movie is ho-hum, and it is shockingly filled with 'we've seen it all before-MTV style edited' thrills and chills. My verdict 5/10 or 'D'.",5,11,20,15 August 2006
