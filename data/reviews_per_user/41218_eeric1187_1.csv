Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This ain't your dad's star wars....too bad
","Well, I waited like many of you did. Waited a long time, for Star Wars to come back. The movie starts out well enough, Jedi taken out droids, but then it SLows down when they arrive on tatooine and slows down even more when they reach coreasaunt. The story of ANakin as a little boy with a retarded Jamican sounding side kick...just..well..sucks! The only thing that saves the movie is the last 40 minutes or so. The fight with the Gungans look cool, but YOU DON'T SEE ANY OF THEM DIE!. There are some dead ones in the background if your looking really hard for them. At least in Jedi, you see an Ewok by the farm. The fighter scene with Anakin, was pretty bad until he blew up the control ship by accident. The best character (qui-gon) gets killed off and that's the only emotional link the audience has to the movie. Did I mention how the pod race is fun the first time you see it, but after that you skip to the chapter on the DVD where darth maul almost runs over Anakin. Anyway, i liked episode 2 much better, but they are still a far cry from the originals.",7,0,1,12 October 2004
