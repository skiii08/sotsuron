The Expendables 2," We've seen it all before
","Every single aspect of this movie screams of Hollywood. Down to the smallest details it does not take an expert to tell this is a classic action movie in pure Hollywood spirit. We follow a crew of five-six unbeatable, super-humans that could kill a guy just by twisting his little finger while screaming 'yippie kay yay'. Their mission is to bring back an object that could be deadly in the wrong hands, but on their journey they bump into some bad guys (surprise surprise). The bad guys leader is also as straight forward as you think. Ice cold, but with a sense of humour, that doesn't mind killing to get what he wants. The most impressive about this movie is the cast. It's quite impressive how many star actors they managed to gather. But it does not help save this movie from being something out of the ordinary. We've seen it all before. A main character that is both a good guy and a bad guy at the same time. I'm sick of movies like this, which follows the old, well-used path to making an action film. It simply fails in entertaining.The only reason for you to watch this movie is you have to love the old Hollywood aspect of movie making. Sadly, I've seen enough, and I'm starving for something new and innovative.Overall: 5/10",5,7,17,18 August 2012
District 9," The story is spoiled by using the wrong type of characters and a badly written script.
","I watched this movie with high expectations because of the good reviews here on IMDb. I expected this to be a brilliant movie which would blow my mind, sadly it did not. The beginning of the movie starts out with a TV-crew giving a interview to the people of MNU, an organization which is in charge of communications with the aliens who have stranded on earth, the camera- crew follows the main person around and gives a unique insight to the event. This twist with the interview is something I liked very much, it gives the viewer good information about the event which has taken place. In short terms, it's very good. It also keeps things interesting, until they decide to drop it and go back to the original camera setup.What disappointed me the most was not the story itself. The story is actually pretty good, and I believe with a few changes I would have enjoyed it. No, what turned me off was the horrible script and the characters which doesn't fit in a movie setting like this. Not one time did I feel any sympathy for any of the characters. They simply does not belong in this kind of setting. With different actors and a new script this movie would be close to a masterpiece. The visual effects are good. The explosions look real enough and the aliens movements are very believable. I really liked it when the movie showed me the story from the aliens point of view. But sadly, this only happened a few, short times. Wespend most of the time watching the main character. The aliens are well created and and more time from their point of view would have given a boost to this story. In short terms, I liked some parts of the movie. Especially the beginning where the camera-crew took a very nice twist. But when they got back to original camera setup they failed. Continuing with the same camera setup would have given the story a nice twist all through it. The visual effects are nicely made, and the designers deserve some credits for it, sure I've seen better, but they are not bad at all. The story itself is actually quite good. But using the wrong types of characters and the badly written script destroyed the whole movie experience for me. All in all I'll give it a 6/10.",6,0,1,1 December 2011
