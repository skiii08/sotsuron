Blade Runner 2049," Slow movie, but worth the patience—has to be seen in cinemas
","As a fan of the original, I was skeptical with the new Blade Runner. Although Denis Villeneuve is a very skilled director, Blade Runner does have such cult status, almost sacredness... so people naturally had lots of expectations about this one. I think in the end, the new installment certainly delivers!The atmosphere is super thick and the movie makers went a lot in the world building direction, using the story to put in a lot of important sci-fi / cyberpunk ideas that should definitely inspire you and that definitely ask some deep questions, just as good sci-fi is supposed to do. The cinematography is indeed stunning, it's a one-in-its kind thing that you won't see in anytime soon. Hyper-stylized, yes, but distracting from the apparent realism of the world, no. As a fan of electronica, the soundtrack stood out to me in particular. It managed to be modern and unique while at the same time staying true to some of the tunes of the original.Now, a lot of people are complaining about the movie being slow and the story perhaps not living up to the visuals. I see where these folks are coming from as the movie is indeed slow—but that's in part at least because modern audiences are used to rapid plot developments and quick cutting sequences. In fact, let's remind ourselves that the old Blade Runner was really slow as well, and perhaps some things are better not be updated!If you have the patience, I think you are in for a really emotional ride. Perhaps even more so than the old Blade Runner, this one is filled with sadness. Ryan Gosling does a perfect job at balancing his calmness with this intense feeling of pent-up anger and despair. There's existential dread without an army or a massive fight. The big themes discussed in the movie hit on the theme of identity and one's purpose in life. Each character is struggling with their identity or purpose in some form or another. I admit that I cried at the end of the movie as multiple of the themes and metaphors that were explored throughout the movie converge on what I see as a beautiful conclusion to a truly epic story.So, expect a slow ride, expect to be sucked into a truly compelling word, and don't miss this one while it's running in the cinema—it's definitely not going to be the same on your average home screen. Go and watch it!",9,3,9,9 October 2017
First Man," A giant leap for humanity, but not for cinema
","We all know the story of 'First Man'... 1969 moon landing, Neil Armstrong, yada yada. It's an absolutely impressive story-after all, we flew to the freakin' moon! This is a massive feat of science and human accomplishment that truly needs to be celebrated, and what better way to do so with a stellar cast and a director of Whiplash fame!The movie starts off with a kick-ass nailbiter of a scene that rivals 'Gravity' in its suspense. They totally got the 60's clunky technology vibes right with an amazing sound design and visual effects so good that you never question the time you're in. Also, I like the overall idea of focusing on the human story behind all the politics, especially as Claire Foy's performance as Janet Armstrong was very powerful.That said, I felt surprisingly unmoved by this pic. What did move me was the human accomplishment depicted by the movie, but not so much the movie itself. It's almost as the movie relies too much on the power of the source material. Story-wise, I felt that the movie hat some pacing issues and felt a little slow in the middle, and the final moon landing felt underwhelming.I think one big issue is Ryan Gosling's emotional deadpan performance. It doesn't matter whether this does or does not reflect Neil Armstrong's real character: If a movie has a protagonist that is unemotional, then chances are that the audience doesn't feel as much either.Another big issue I had with the movie was the whole backstory relating to the Armstrong's lost daughter and all that. This aspect of 'First Man' reminded me quite a bit of 'Arrival', and just as in that movie, this tragic backstory was supposed to somehow motivate or drive Neil Armstrong. However, this whole emotional dimension was mostly lost throughout the rest of the movie... and when it did come back, it felt contrived and somewhat cheesy.All in all, a good movie with some great camerawork and some excellent acting by Claire Foy... however, in the end, this doesn't give justice to the epic scope of this amazing part of human history.",6,1,2,17 November 2018
Men in Black 3," Exciting and entertaining, with nice reconstruction of 60's
","J and K return to another adventure—this time with time travel involved. This sequel keeps some of the same energy that characterized its prequels and adds a bit of color by being partially set in the 60's.Yes, there is time paradoxes. And yes, there are some plot holes / points where the main villain, Boris the Animal, doesn't act particularly smart and you're wondering about his actions. But all in all the story works and adds some depth to the relationship between J and K, as well as quite some nice revelations towards the end that round up the whole Men in Black trilogy.Special effects are o.k. to good (sometimes the CGI looks very CGI) and the action is entertaining. All in all a successful follow up to the prequels.",7,0,2,25 February 2017
The Equalizer," One of Denzel's worst performances - soul-less and generic
","Everything about this movie is generic: the music, the lights, even the fighting, with some pretty corny cinematography to round things off. I generally really like Denzel Washington as an actor, but he gives such a lackluster performance in this one, and I think he has been miscast, or at least been misdirected by a director who does not seem to have a unique vision at all. Denzel's character's back story is something that we have seen time and time again, but it comes off as unbelievable here. On top of that, the story is so badly structured, with some characters that play a big role early on seemingly forgotten for the rest of the film. Altogether a huge disappointment.",3,0,1,28 March 2020
It," A movie's movie - stunningly beautiful, mystical, haunting
","I absolutely loved the new 'IT' movie and didn't expect it to be that good. It is a perfectly paced and beautifully shot movie that captures some of the love for 80's horror movies.But 'IT' is actually much more than just a rehash of a plain-old horror movie: The characters are all interesting and the kids' acting skills are surprisingly convincing and moving. You really do feel for them and you want them to succeed, which is really what makes a horror movie be a hit or a flop. The emotional subplots are not too shallow as well—the love story does not feel haphazardly attached onto everything else; the interactions between the characters feel meaningful and real.The new clown is also quite well done with some very creepy acting and a compelling voice. What's more: I didn't even mind the CGI of the horror effects. Usually CGI puts me off, but here, everything was done rather well with some really suspenseful moments.In the end, what really got me to love the new 'IT' is that this is a movie for people who love movies. The cinematography is just like true movie fans like it: Lots of stunning landscape and wide shots, perfect lighting and atmosphere, and on top of that a great score! What do you want more?",8,3,5,20 September 2017
Chinatown," This movie got it all: perfectly paced study of human darkness
","I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that's why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn't really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.In a recent New York Times piece, they called CHINATOWN 'a meditation on evil', which is spot-on. Set in 1937, this movie is just all-round perfect, first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie, that is rich in themes (water, evil, trust, guilt, greed) and even richer in suspense, as the audience—just like our protagonist—tries to find out what is happening. The story is 'complex' for sure, but it's not 'complicated'. Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.Besides the impeccable screenplay, everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway's stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful, the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic! So, if you're ready to delve deep into a richly layered exploration of the dark side of humanity—enjoy the ride. But don't expect to come back unscathed.",10,60,66,26 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," Would be better as a theatre play
","'The Death of Stalin' is a story of betrayal and treason within the communist party after Stalin's death. There's lots of deadpan dialogue and hilarious situational humor.My problem with this movie is that it LOOKS exceptionally boring. Yes, I get it: When one has such an impressive cast to boast, it makes sense to highlight the actors' faces, especially in a movie that is focused on the interaction between different people. The movie is extremely dialogue-heavy... which ultimately means that the creators missed out on an opportunity to tell a story with images. I honestly disrespect movies that could've just as well been a stage theatre play. Why not use what the medium of film has to offer?Besides the genuinely uninteresting cinematography, the whole thing felt contrived, which prevented me from being moved by the movie. Also, since all the characters are equally ridiculous, I didn't have any main protagonist to latch my feelings onto. To some extent I just didn't care what happened to the people in the movie. This lack of a genuine emotional connection could've been repaired by some deep message about communism, or some commentary on the nature of human life in dictatorships-but there was none of that either.So all in all, I felt that this movie was rather pointless, notwithstanding the amazing acting that is to be applauded.",5,3,6,20 January 2019
Train to Busan," More than just a zombie movie, and suspenseful nonetheless
","TRAIN TO BUSAN is a zombie movie for sure. But it's also a story about a father and his daughter. And it's a story about greed and sacrifice. This zombie movie has more heart than most other movies of the genre, yet it will also make most genre fans happy by having some pretty darn scary zombies.I thought this was an all-round solid movie with some scenes that were nail-bitingly suspenseful, effective cinematography, a fast-moving plot, and some decent acting. There's a few cliché moments in there, but hey, that's o.k.! TRAIN TO BUSAN did succeed in conveying some genuine emotions, as well as a genuine sense of dread and apocalypse. I highly recommend it.",8,1,2,20 August 2017
Green Room," Violent and stylish movie that keeps surprising you
","A punk band gets stuck at a secluded white supremacist barn party and carnage ensues. If you like the director's previous movie, BLUE RUIN, or movies like DON'T BREATHE and RED STATE that keep surprising you with cool ways of using a limited scenario in surprising and suspenseful ways, you are going to like this one.The performances are wonderful. Patrick Stewart as white supremacist nazi boss? Hell yeah! What a totally unexpected casting decision that totally paid off. He's super creepy and convincingly so. And Anton Yelchin is just always plain good— especially when playing the dorky but cunning type, as he does here.Plot-wise the movie manages to give the characters enough exposition that you care for them while also jumping straight into the action and ultimately keeping the suspense going for the entire time. Good job!But most impressive is the masterful cinematography. The very first few images tell you that this is a team that understands its craft: Lots of small little details are revealed about the characters with very few targeted images and cuts. Beautiful.",8,3,7,8 March 2017
Baby Driver," Stylish movie, sometimes too loud and fast for my taste
","BABY DRIVER is an action packed tale of a quiet getaway driver for heists planned by Doc, a crime lord played by Kevin Spacey. Baby lives alone with his deaf foster father after his mother died in a car accident, and he falls in love with Debora, a waitress at a local diner. Wanting to stay away from the heists, Baby only finds himself sucked deeper into a crime-filled underworld.The story is filled with themes we know: The beautiful girl as symbol for a normal life outside of crime. The theme of not being able to stay away from crime, and the underworld harming the one's closest to you. And the theme of the fatherly yet dangerous crime boss who took a young boy under his wing. But while we've seen many of these ideas in other movies, BABY DRIVER manages to implement them with grandeur.Sometimes the originality of a movie lies not within its story, but its execution, and it is here where BABY DRIVER excels. The movie does some really new stuff with sound: Baby has tinnitus and always numbs his pain with loud rock music. This serves as the movie's excuse for a manic fusion of music and action. And as we come to expect from an Edgar Wright movie, this audiovisual collage is craftily edited.Despite the impressive style and the great acting (with criminals played by the likes of Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm), I found the movie too loud at times. What jarred my ears was less the music than the car noise and gunshots. Perhaps this was my local cinema amping things up too much... but oh did my ears hurt after some of the action scenes!On top of that... and this is only nagging at the very high level of an otherwise excellent movie, I felt that the pacing was a bit irregular. The movie starts and ends really fast but has a long stretched-out middle part. This is important for character building, but the macro-rhythm of the story arch felt a bit jagged...But again, only small concerns regarding an otherwise impressive piece of film that is definitely one of the must-sees this year!",8,2,6,19 July 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A bold vision of a new kind of cinema
","Only ever so often does a movie hit the big screen that feels genuinely new, like nothing that has been there before. 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is such a movie. This is perhaps the most successful fusion of film and comic book to date, made with love to both genres.Of course, people rave about the movie's style and animation... and yes, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. However, the amazing look and feel of the movie should not make us forget that Spider-Verse gets everything else right as well. This movie has soul! It's a deeply moving coming-of-age story with pitch-perfect screenplay and some great voice acting.Let me also point out how bold 'Into the Spider-Verse' is: Something as experimental and colorful could've easily failed on so many levels, but the creators stuck with their vision and made no compromises in style or story. This is to be rewarded!All in all, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is absolute masterclass and hands-down one of the best movies of 2018.",10,4,10,20 January 2019
Dunkirk," Impressive, yes—enjoyable, depends.
","Christopher Nolan's DUNNKIRK is a war movie par excellence. It is raw, with a simple premise, no exposition needed. The story unfolds entirely through action, similar to movies such as MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. There is little dialogue, but the true nature of each character reveals itself through his (all major protagonists are male) actions.I appreciate Hollywood making movies like this. Its attempt to depict war in as distilled a form as possible, is a welcome change from the romantic-action- comedy-superhero miscellany we so often see these days. DUNNKIRK is very much 'old cinema'. There's a sense of purity, with a minimalistic score, an emphasis on practical effects, and lots of wide shots and landscape shots that take their time.That said, whether you ultimately like DUNNKIRK or not depends on whether you like war movies or not. And whether you can endure the intensity... and the deafening loudness of this movie. I have two problems with DUNNKIRK, and although both minor in themselves, together they spoiled my experience:First, the sound design is jarring irritating. Yes, director Nolan likes to emphasize environmental sounds and have his actors mumble through muffled masks. But the ratio of vocal amplitude to the amplitude of war sounds (particularly gun shots) is simply off. Nolan has a thing for deafening gun shots, and this time they almost made me want to leave the theatre to protect my hearing. While the difficulty of hearing voices compared to the loudness of the environmental sounds may give the movie a sense of authenticity, it also means that there's extra cognitive effort in trying to understand what people are saying. Nolan, don't make your audience work so hard! And please don't give us tinnitus!Second (and this one is perhaps more of a personal matter), Nolan should really try once and for all not to actively impress us. His style of cinema so desperately wants to instil awe in you, every image cries out 'do you notice how epic this is?' In recent years, Nolan has one made one great epic after another. And yes, his movies are truly impressive, but I would like to see how he would deal with something more small-scale and subtle.DUNNKIRK is definitely a must-see, if only to be able to talk about it. But be prepared to be actually thrown into the trenches (or beaches) of war, which may not be the feeling you seek in cinema, especially if you can't deal with noise so well.",7,1,3,4 August 2017
Get Out," Suspenseful & witty horror flick about racial stereotypes
","GET OUT is the story of how a black guy—Chris, played by the marvellous Daniel Kaluuya—and his white girl-friend visit her parent's mansion at the countryside. At first sight, his girl-friend's parents seem just fine with Chris being black. But he soon discovers that something is off. The black 'servants' at the mansion are behaving oddly, as if brainwashed. And as he digs deeper, more secrets about hist girl-friend's family are being revealed.GET OUT is witty as hell. It deals with racial stereotypes in a funny way, turning them outward and explicit by making racial divides within the US the premise of a horror movie. The script is spot-on, with just enough jokes to keep you laughing, just enough racial subtext to make it cringe-worthy, and just enough seriousness so as to not destroy the suspense. And it is there where GET OUT excels: In many movies, suspense and comedy are mutually exclusive. Not here! GET OUT manages to keep both up and going till the very end.Mix into this great performances (both on the protagonist and the villain's side), good cinematography, some fun play with US accents, self-awareness of and commentary on horror movie tropes ... perfected with a dash of violence and gore ... and you'll end up with something that's truly unique, managing to deliver many complex emotions simultaneously while still just being outright fun.",7,9,19,27 March 2017
Logan," Hyper-violent and grim successor to Wolverine 1 & 2
","LOGAN is a great successor to the previous Wolverine movies. It sets a darker and more personal tone, focusing in much more depth on an ageing and sicklish Wolverine who doesn't quite know what to do himself in a grim 2029. He ultimately finds purpose in protecting a small mutant girl, helping her to reach a sanctuary hidden away from the evil company that is chasing her.The girl reminded me much of Saorise Ronan in HANNA, a movie that had a similar theme of a gifted and violent 'product' being chased by her creators. Otherwise, the LOGAN combines the 'America's backyard' imagery of movies such as HELL OR HIGH WATER with moody tracks and suspenseful plot. The screenplay has a lot of room for character development, but at times I felt the story was a bit trodding along, with sometimes no clear sense of immediate purpose. The action is great, but unfortunately the most powerful action scene is early on when the girl's powers are being revealed—the action after that is still entertaining but it doesn't quite live up to that first scene.Of all X-Men-themed movies, LOGAN clearly is the most violent one, at times bordering into splatter. The body count is steadily rising and there certainly are quite a few beheadings, cut-off fingers, arms and legs, as well as many, many broken bones—brutal killings galore!! I abso-freakin-lutely loved the violence, but be warned: It might not be for everybody.All in all a great movie, albeit with a few minor flaws!",8,2,6,8 March 2017
Sicario," Masterclass in how to create suspense
","Sicario is a cineast's dream: great plot, spot-on acting, razor-sharp editing, and an absolutely epic score. What I love most about Villeneuve's style is that he allows shots to 'breathe', giving the viewer enough time for the beautiful compositions to soak in.Sicario is quite violent and will surely keep you at the edge of your seat, but it also has depth, both in terms of having interesting characters, as well as in terms of the commentary it makes about the politics of drug wars and border control.All in all, Sicario is a masterpiece.",8,2,3,20 January 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Colorful and entertaining
","The sequence to GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY sticks to most of the good things that made the first movie such a success. It's a more colorful vision of Sci-Fi than what we see in oh-so-many gray dystopias. And it's warm-hearted and light-headed, never taking itself too seriously. And even though self-irony pervades almost every image, there is some genuine sense of suspense in at least some of the action-packed scenes. The movie has some hilarious new side characters, in particular the arrogant queen of the Sovereigns—all painted in gold. The sensitive 'Mantis' and her interactions with Drax add a tint of cuteness. The performances of the main cast, the likes of Zoe Saldana and Chris Pratt, was as good as we come to expect.The plot's main theme surrounds the discovery of Chris Pratt's past. This piece of the story is interesting enough to keep you going, but it's also not particularly deep and moving—a somewhat slower pace and a bit more 'feel' for the depth of the characters would have helped here, but then, oh well, there'd been less time for all the fun action! And so VOL. 2 of the guardians is a blooming and buzzing action sci-fi adventure with a somewhat shallow story ... but it's entertaining nonetheless! If you liked the first one, this is definitely recommended.",7,0,3,28 May 2017
Mother!," Watch it to make up your own mind—deeply disturbing
","Ugh, 'Mother!' makes you feel bad... Jennifer Lawrence's character just moved in with her husband, a poet played by Javier Bardem. Their seemingly idyllic life becomes interrupted when a mysterious man and a woman, played by Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, invite themselves to the couple's new home... and from there on, things spiral downward.Among the many good things that stand out about 'Mother!' is Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. Her face fills almost every shot and the whole story is told in a deeply subjective way from her perspective: As she is trying to make sense of what is happening around her, so are we.When I watched the trailers for 'Mother!', I thought this was just going to be a rip-off of ROSEMARY'S BABY, but in fact, the movie is nothing like that. You continue to be surprised from beginning to end, and there is a lot of mystery that is deeply haunting. The suspense keeps going as you try to make sense of this movie, which is deeply metaphorical and open to many interpretations. You will leave the theatre wondering what you just saw and discussing the deeper meaning with your friends. Because 'Mother!' is rich, contextualized and multi-layered, it's best to just see it for yourself, if you don't mind being deliberately confused and irritated, and if you don't mind a lot of religious subtext.",7,1,2,28 September 2017
Lucy," Hard to swallow, even for the spiritually open-minded
","People say we use only 10% of our brains. The scientific community is 100% sure this is false. Call me a killjoy, but I find it hard to accept movies that are based on an utterly anti-scientific premise. In fact, I find promoting blatant falsehoods that promote anti-evolutionary thinking a bit irresponsible, even for the sake of art and entertainment!Science education set aside, how does LUCY work as a movie? Well, Scarlett Johansson is convincingly awkward and beautiful. Luc Besson's obsession with strong mysterious female leads clearly shines through and Johansson as an actor delivers. The movie is hyper-stylish, with gleaming colors and convincing CGI (lots of). The action is as entertaining as the visuals. And thankfully they decided to keep things short, focus on the core idea and stop right before it became trite.That said, I think LIMITLESS dealt with the 10% myth better as it stayed (somewhat) more within the realm of scientific credibility. And as far as movies go in which people develop godlike powers, LUCY doesn't beat the likes of THE MATRIX or SYMBOL (shimboru,2009).All in all an interesting but ultimately mediocre movie based on an utterly ridiculous (and intellectually dangerous) idea.",5,40,71,8 March 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Nails the mockumentary genre - hilarious
","WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a fake documentary following a group of vampires who have a shared living arrangement in a worn-down mansion in New Zealand. One of the new members brings a human into their group, which causes all sorts of troubles. An adventure filled with magic, werewolves and vampires ensues.WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the funniest movies I've seen since quite a while. The characters are plain hilarious, and each one is unique and also relatable. The characters are essentially just hyper-clichéd stereotypes, such as the German pedantic vampire with a penchant for organizing his friends' lives, or the sex crazed vampire master with a craving for torture. Yet, despite being such stereotypes, each character is quite believable—in part achieved through the great (and hilarious) performances.The movie exudes a sense of play and joy. It certainly doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's also not too silly to be dumb. A comedy like this falls or rises with the wittiness of its jokes and in this one, all the jokes are spot on. Definitely worth watching!",9,3,6,27 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," Not quite the Alien movie we longed for
","ALIEN: COVENANT follows a space mission that's planned to populate new worlds with humans. The crew of the colony ship 'Covenant' intersects an unknown signal coming from a habitable planet. As we come to expect from any movie of the franchise, diverting the colonization mission to the source of the signal may not have been the best of ideas...I consider myself a hardcore fan of the franchise. And I liked the beginning of the movie, especially when everything devolves into visceral madness in a way that is quite uncompromising .... but then, after starting with a massive bang, ALIEN: COVENANT slows down and just becomes utterly boring, filled with pseudo-gibberish about creation and perfection.There are aspects of the plot whose predictability are almost insulting to the audience. The pacing is off, with sometimes too much talk and sometimes too much action; no sense of rhythm for sure. And there are some characters that are just plain forgettable—you don't really care much when they die because you didn't get the chance to know them in the first place.But ultimately, what really shocked me the most was that I couldn't relate to Michael Fassbender's character. As we have come to expect from Fassbender, the acting is superb, but the story just doesn't give enough time to properly motivate the character's actions. I oftentimes found myself confused: Why does he do the things he does? What's the big deal?Besides shortcomings in the plot, the frantic and jittery action is at times off-putting. And then there's massive use of CGI. Oooooooh.... CGI ! Hardcore alien fans have come to hate it. Call me old school, but I really did long for more practical effects in this one. The xenomorphs, despite multimillion dollar graphics, just didn't seem to be 'there', they didn't have a real presence.I give it a 6 out of 10—slightly above average because the movie did manage to entertain me... and because of the genuinely gruesome and gut-wrenching body horror. But then, you can't base a good movie on just that. In the end, you need a compelling story.",6,2,8,20 May 2017
