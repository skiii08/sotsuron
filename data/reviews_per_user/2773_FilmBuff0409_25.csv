The Blair Witch Project," Scary!!!
",Scary movie. Builds tension effectively up to the unforgettable ending. This is one movie you'll never forget.,9,1,3,2 May 2019
It," If you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie
","This movie is pretty much 2 hours of little kids running around screaming and yelling obscenities at each other. Not sure what the appeal of a group of young kids coming together to fight the bad guys. It's not at all realistic for one, and it's just kind of annoying. I know I'm the odd man out on this one but I just can't get myself to believe that a bunch of 12 year olds actually talk like that, or have the attention span to dig into the mystery of It and go after it. No kid would ever go into a scary looking house where they know a killer clown is hiding. It did have some jump scares, cheap but effective the first time.Now, that being said this is definitely one of the better Stephen King adaptations, but if you're a reader, the book is a lot scarier and slightly more believable. I'm looking forward to part 2, an adult cast should bring this story to life a bit more.",4,1,6,30 April 2019
Hereditary," Incredible
","This is one movie I will never forget. It is very disturbing, and will leave you thinking about it for days after. The first time watching this I didn't know what to expect, I skipped the trailer for that reason. There are quite a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming. My boyfriend called a few of the big twists before they happened, but I'm assuming most people were surprised. Once the credits rolled I immediately decided that I never wanted to see this movie again, in a good way. It was just SO disturbing!! It gets under your skins and doesn't let you go even after the ending scene. I was confused so I googled some explanations and it cleared a lot up, but I recommend going into this one blind. It will blow your socks off!It loses one star because it is a fairly long and often boring movie. It's a real slow burner, but still worth the watch, just not something you can watch over and over.",9,2,5,30 April 2019
A Star Is Born," Horrible movie
",Can't stand the music from this movie. Not sure what the appeal was? Not a good movie in the slightest.,1,4,7,1 May 2019
The Babadook," A slow burner that pays off
","This is one scary movie. This is more a drama than a horror movie in my opinion but believe me, the horror scenes are plenty scary. I haven't seen this movie in years and I still remember vividly when the babadook entered the boys room at night. If that scene didn't scare you then I'm not sure what will. Highly recommend for those wanting a strong drama with some good frights along the way!",8,2,3,1 May 2019
Us," What a cringe fest
","This movie was so bad. I really don't have words for how I feel after watching it. None of it made sense, this director thinks he's something he's not because people liked his first film (which I also did not enjoy). There was absolutely no common sense, a few examples are<ul><li>when the woman is told to cuff herself to the table, why not cuff yourself to the leg so you can slide it off and free yourself? Rather than actually trapping yourself. And when she's reaching for the fire hook she couldn't just drag the table? She had to pick it up with her foot? Hmm. And if the hook broke the wooden bar so easily why could you not do it yourself?</li></ul><ul><li>when her face is being pressed into the table and the glass starts cracking, I'm sorry but you would suffer brain damage before the force would be enough to crack a glass table.</li></ul><ul><li>when the person stabs the car window with scissors and they go through the window, there is absolutely no way in hell that that is possible.</li></ul><ul><li>when the young girl is running away she runs right in the middle of the street in perfect light, common sense would be to get off the road and out of the streetlights? And when the 'twin' finds her the girl lays on the road. SHE ACTUALLY LAYS DOWN to look for her. That's not a good position to be in if you have to run suddenly. Good way to get yourself killed.</li></ul><ul><li>the young girl when she's in the neighbours house walks through the hall, not looking around at all. If there are people hunting you you'd better look all around you.</li></ul><ul><li>when the daughters twin is on the car and it stops suddenly, the girl flies backwards into a tree, a 3 year old could even tell you that in that situation you would fall forward, I couldn't believe the stupidity of it. And I'm a fan of the Scary Movie series.</li></ul><ul><li>The mom 'twin's' voice made me laugh out loud at how bad it was.</li></ul>I could go on all night about how awful this film was, but I'd sooner just forget about the whole ordeal. I will say that I did like main plot idea (until the half assed explanation at the end that made no sense). I really wanted to like this but every 5 minutes I was shaking my head in disbelief at the utter stupidity of the characters. Elisabeth Moss put your talent to better use next time.",2,2,4,24 November 2019
Dead Poets Society," Good
","I vaguely remember this movie but I do remember that I was a little bored, it was okay though just too long.",8,0,2,16 May 2019
Bird Box," Disturbing!!
","I read the book a few years back, I don't remember much but I do remember that it was real scary. The movie did it justice, Sandra Bullock did an incredible job portraying Mallory. This was one tense movie, from start to finish this was a nail biter and had some quite disturbing scenes. Netflix has been coming out with some pretty bad shows but this one's a diamond in the rough. Highly recommend.",9,1,3,30 April 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," Scary, bloody, relentless
",This is one wild ride from start to finish. The makeup is incredible and the story is unforgiving. Very well done. Recommend if you have a strong stomach.,8,2,3,1 May 2019
She's the Man," Fun movie
","This is a light fun comedy. Don't take it too seriously, just laugh and have a good time.",8,0,0,2 May 2019
The Conjuring 2," Just as good as the first
","Very entertaining, just as terrifying as the first. A refreshing addition to the horror genre. This will do the trick even for those who don't scare easily.",8,0,1,4 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Not bad
",Not my favorite Spider-Man movie but definitely not the worst. I would say Spider-Man 2 was the worst instalment. Go see this if you have a chance!,7,1,7,27 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," So I must have missed the point
","If I'm quite honest I walked out of the movie theatre just the same as I walked in. I purposefully didn't look at any trailers or read anything on the film. Seeing how I absolutely loved The Hateful Eight I thought that this, or anything by Tarantino for that matter, would be great. I was wrong. This movie was a whole lot of, well, nothing.My impression of this film is that Tarantino got bored of not being in the spotlight and just wrote a script over a weekend and gathered up as many big names he could to make this movie. So let me first start on a positive note, the acting is incredible. Leo and Brad are very convincing in their roles. Everyone else was good too, but most of the big names had very very little parts to play. Dakota Fanning was in this movie for maybe 5 minutes to play a crackhead. Tommy Lee Jones say in a bar from start to finish and he only got about 5-10 minutes of screen time.So back to the point, I don't really know how to write this bad review. Mostly because I don't know what I just watched. I don't know what the point of this movie was. If I had to give a rundown of it and explain the whole thing, this is what it would be... (don't worry, no spoilers here. Not that there's anything to spoil)Leo and his stunt double had buzzing careers in the film industry, when Leo finds out that he doesn't have the audience he once did and his career is going downhill at record speed, he decides to start acting in Italian films. Meanwhile Margot Robbie was just the neighbour and wife of a famous director. She spends her time in this movie simply walking around town. Leo starts filming and is struggling with remembering his lines. Brad Pitt drives around, then fixes Leo's antenna that blew down. Then he goes for a drive and picks up a 16 year old hooker. Takes her back to her trailer park and there's he goes to see his old boss there. The kids get angry and slash his tires and he beats the one up and makes him fix the tire. After that he picks up Leo and Drives home. They go drinking and then get back home. Then there's a break in and a big fight with the hippies, Brad goes to the hospital and Leo goes to meet his neighbor. The end.Firstly, the hippies had no real reason to want to kill Leo. They were high and explained that they wanted to kill all the people who taught them to kill in movies. Pretty weak, I didn't buy it. But okay sure.Brad Pitt apparently killed his wife. We see a 15 second flashback to that scene and nothing after. There was never any follow up.I don't understand what the neighbors role was in this movie. Margot Robbie was all over the cover of this film but literally all she does is walk around town then go see a movie, then go to a dinner with her friends.This entire movie was just a waste of good talent and my time. I don't see how people are rating it so highly. Maybe I was just wrong for expecting something with a little more Action or mystery like his last film. The critical reception is very good for this movie so hopefully he uses that not to make another movie like this but to get back to his old style.",3,8,24,28 July 2019
Get Out," Wasn't bad
",This movie was pretty predictable. Unique yes. Entertaining? Not really. I found myself dozing a few times in the theatre. For me this wasn't the masterpiece it claimed to be. I wouldn't watch it again but for a one time watch it was fine. But easy to forget right when you leave the theatre.,7,0,3,4 May 2019
Insidious," This is one scary movie.
",Easily one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Even now that I've seen it a few times it still gets me every time. You'll be sleeping with the lights on for a week after seeing this.,8,0,0,4 May 2019
A Quiet Place," Intense
","This movie is very good, don't think too hard about it and just enjoy the ride. The tension starts in the first few minutes of the show and builds to the point where you're squirming in your seat and trying to be as quiet as possible, you will not want to make a sound while watching this. This movie effectively adds some drama into it and makes for people you are rooting for right to the finish. The finale is intense and as sad as the ending is, I think it could not have been better. Highly recommend.",9,0,1,4 May 2019
Into the Wild," Does the true story justice
","This lived up to the book and the true story of Chris McCandless. This portrayed his spirit and drive expertly. Never have I related to a character so strongly. This story captures the beauty and unforgiving spirit of the great Alaskan wilds. But by the end of the movie I can forgive McCandless' lack of preparedness because he was truly willing to give up everything, even his life, to pursue his true human nature and leave all the comforts of the modern world behind. I think this is a story everyone should witness whether through the movie, or better, the book. This has a lot to say and is subject to a lot of debate. I can't speak highly enough of this story.",10,1,1,1 May 2019
Midsommar," I am speechless
","Watching this movie I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, or just walk out altogether. This is the most disturbing and graphic movie I've ever seen. Right from the opening scene I was overwhelmed with dread and discomfort and it never relented that awful feeling even after the credits rolled. I couldn't speak for 10 minutes after stumbling out of that theatre.
So all in all what to expect, you will Go through many emotions, most if not all of them will be negative. You will be disturbed, sad, disgusted, uncomfortable, shocked, anxious. But aside from all that there's something about this movie that keeps you watching eagerly.I'm not sure I can say I enjoyed this movie. But what the producer was trying to make the viewer feel, I got that. And for that I call this film a huge success. When this movie is held up to Hereditary, it makes the last movie seem like a children's show.",9,20,46,8 July 2019
Don't Breathe," Incredibly intense
","This movie is very scary, it's too late now but this is one of those movies you must see in theatres. The tension is almost unbearable. And with characters you care about and are rooting for you'll be holding your breath right until the end, this movie sticks to its title promise 'don't breathe'.",9,0,1,7 May 2019
The Descent," One of my favorite
","Because of this movie I'll never go spelunking. Whatever is underground I don't want to know. This movie scared me as a kid and scares me still. Great acting and the tension is real. If you have claustrophobia this movie might not be for you, some of the scenes in this movie brought me close to a claustrophobic panic attack.",8,1,2,1 May 2019
The Conjuring," I did not sleep!!!
","I saw this in theatres when it first came out and I can still remember how scared I was. Kept me on the edge of my seat, literally, from start to finish. And then once it was over I felt fine. Until I was in bed, I'm a grown man and I admit I slept with the lights on that night, only after staying up until about 5 in the morning. I'm a horror movie buff, not at all easy to scare, but this one did the trick.",8,0,0,25 April 2019
Halloween," Incredible achievement
",This is arguably one of the best old horror movies ever made. Michael Myers reign of terror hasn't let up ever since. Every Halloween night I watch this and it still scares me every time. Good fun! More suspense and tension than gore which is always appreciated in a horror movie. I'll never be sick of this movie!,9,0,0,1 May 2019
Life," Fun show
","This was a pretty good movie. I watched it for the biology aspect of it and the first half really delivered. It was interesting and realistic at first but then it got carried away to please a more basic audience, which was okay but I think if it didn't change direction and keep things within the realm of what is really possible then it would have been better. But again space is largely unexplored so maybe there is a creature who can survive just about anything, from fire to water to no oxygen to the vacuum of space where it came from. The end has a fun little twist, which I saw coming from a mile away but was still pleasantly surprised to find that I was right.I'm going to steal this line from Jurassic park because it fits so perfectly; life always finds a way. Humans are not always the apex predators once were rid of our weapons and wits.",8,1,3,4 May 2019
Easy A," Fun movie with a good message
","Pretty good movie, believable and funny. Reminded me of mean girls. This is a drama for sure but doesn't feel like it because of the humour. Drags on a bit at points, but aside from that it's a pretty great show. Recommend to any mean girls fans.",8,0,0,2 May 2019
Annihilation," What happened?
","I find this is very common with book to movie adaptations, I read the book and it's great, and then I watch the movie and I'm completely lost. This was no exception. The book was pretty vague and not the greatest, it left a lot of questions unanswered, but no appeal to read the next two books to find out. But this isn't a book review. The movie was a mess, I couldn't even finish it. None of it made sense, the scenes all felt like a jumble, it didn't have any direction from what I understood. This group of people go to some strange place on earth, for what? Who knows. They walk around and people die from time to time by some poor CGI effects. I don't even know how to review this film because I have no idea what happened!! And I read the damn book for it. I'm not sure where all the good reviews are coming from, I must have seen a different show or just missed a big bit of it? Very confusing film. Don't recommend.",4,0,2,30 April 2019
