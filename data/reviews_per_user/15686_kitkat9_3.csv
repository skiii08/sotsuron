50 First Dates," An Original Mix of Comedy and Romance
","What a pleasant surprise!  'Fifty First Dates'  successfully combines all of the elements of a laugh-out-loud comedy with a tug-at-your-heartstrings romance in a truly original way! There's enough gross-out, hurt angry guy and silly song comedy to satisfy any Adam Sandler fan.  And the love story is both sweet and funny (as all good love stories should be) without being too cliched or predictable. And although the movie-goer is pretty sure that they, along with Adam and the always silly and sweet Drew Barrymore, will get a happy ending, the movie takes you on the road less travelled and truly delivers a heartwarming and unique conclusion. This is definitely one date movie where both the girl and the guy will leave the theatre feeling happy (I know that I did!)!!",8,0,0,3 March 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," A kiss to end all kisses
","Just wanted to say that the ending of this movie is simply wonderful...that kiss!! WOW! The whole movie still gives me hope, even though I am in my 32nd year of being a singleton and I did not meet any handsome men in awful reindeer sweaters at a turkey curry buffet over the holidays!",10,1,2,3 January 2004
Cold Mountain," There Are No Small Actors
","This is a great drama that contains many interesting elements of romance, struggle, and the human condition, that nicely combine into a satisfying plot but it is truly the actors (and mainly the supporting ones at that) that make this a film worth seeing. There are many striking performances from individuals who ofter go above and beyond their pre-established skill levels.  Indeed, it is not the actors telling the story but rather the characters themselves. The Stanislavski method was definitely in use and just as the actors had immersed themselves in the roles, we, the audience we're able to be fully immersed in the story. Of particular note (besides, of course, the incomparable Renee Zellweger, who is fantastic but won her Oscar based not only on this performance but that of the last three years of work!) are Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Kathy Baker and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who all make the most of their brief, yet poignant, appearances in the film.  Each of these actors make their jobs seem effortless and all have an incredible way of getting at the soul of the piece and the heart of the audience. All in all, this is a fine drama and worth at least one look.  Be prepared to get lost in the story and inwardly applaud those who made its telling possible.",7,0,0,20 March 2004
