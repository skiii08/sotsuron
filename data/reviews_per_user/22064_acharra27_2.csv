"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," One of my all time favorites
","It has been in my movie top ten since its release. I love the costumes, I love scenery, I love the acting, I love the story, I adore the quirkiness and I applaud the atypical casting of and subsequent performances by 3 of Australia's most popular leading men.  They made me believe.  It is just an all around feel-good movie that I have watched over and over.",10,1,3,28 June 2003
28 Days Later...," Amazing story
","I am not a horror movie fan, but I do enjoy an occasional suspense. This movie was really amazing, just for the story alone.The lead characters were believable, although...at times I did have to ask 'Why are you going in there alone, you moron?' - specifically with Jim in mind.  The Road Warrior-esque deserted landscape was particularly interesting.  I would like to know how they managed to completely unpopulate London so convincingly.The director, Danny Boyle, also directed Trainspotting, which is almost half the reason I decided to see the movie - the other half being that I'm a fan of Alex Garland.  Danny Boyle's style is excellent, very dark with intense direction.  It fit very well as did the video format, choppy movements and slightly blurred images.  Very convincing, gave you a feeling of dark desolation and confusion, which the characters no doubt felt.  The movie was a bit gory, but necessary.Overall I feel that the movie was well done.  Surprisingly.  I am still afraid to see the Beach, afraid of how the book may have been butchered. I felt this was just very good, as far as 'horror' movies go.",8,0,0,28 June 2003
