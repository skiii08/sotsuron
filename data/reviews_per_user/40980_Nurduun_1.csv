Requiem for a Dream," Realism In Dreamview
","Harsh realism delivered in a fragile package.From start to end you are, in lack of better words, mesmorized by a fantastic direction delivered by Darren Aronofsky, a straight, sturdy realistic, perspective on the destructive force of drugs, brought to life by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly. spiced with a mind blowing performance by Ellen Burstyn, and topped of with a music experience, that gives one a sense of how fragile life can be.Never a dull moment.A sense of total devotion, from the team behind it.A film to be viewed, based on indulgence in the art of film making, but in every way, able to please any critic.A true masterpiece.",Null,0,1,9 May 2004
