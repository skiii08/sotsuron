Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Every Great Story Has A Starting Point
","It's hard to review the Star Wars saga and not say things that haven't been said a thousand times already. However, I'm going to take a different approach when reviewing the series, reviewing them in their proper chronological order rather than the order they were originally released. As we review the series in episodic order, we'll start off with Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, the most critically malled, panned, torn apart entry in the series. Never before has there come a film that has been so hyped and so hated by many Star Wars fanatics, and still to this day, nearly 14 years since the film's original release, the film still gets a ton of crap poured upon it. When the film was released in 3-D a year ago, instead of being excited, many were moaning and groaning and resorting to a certain internet reviewer's 90 minute review of the film. But what do I think about The Phantom Menace. To be perfectly honest, I like the movie, I like the movie a lot. We all have things we like and dislike, and The Phantom Menace is surely one of those things I like. The reason I like the movie so much is because it is the most light hearted of the saga, much like the first entry in the Harry Potter series. It has it's dark moments, but compared to the dark elements in the following installments, they're like a walk to the ice cream store with Ewoks. This film is mostly upbeat and starts off the story of one man, who at this point in the story is a little boy working as a slave on the planet Tatooine. His name is Anakin Skywalker, and although Jake Lloyd's not the best child actor I've ever seen, he's far from the worst. He's an open minded fellow, just like many of our youthful selves and when things go wrong, he just keeps pushing forward and looking on the bright side of things. He's like a lot of us when we are 9-10 years of age.Little Anakin is discovered by a Jedi Master named Qui-Gon Jinn, a peasant clothed girl named Padme, a dim witted, yet jolly amphibian called Jar Jar Binks and a walking trash can droid called R2-D2. All of them are caught within the midst of a trading dispute, a dispute putting the lives of many people living on Padme's home world of Naboo in danger. While repairing their ship, Anakin is able to win a pod race as well as his freedom and Qui-Gon and his party take him with them to the planet of Coruscant so Padme's queen can speak about the dispute to the senate and Anakin can go to the Jedi Order to be trained as a jedi. Because Anakin is too old and unusually strong with the force, the Jedi council doesn't allow him to be trained, but the benevolent Qui-Gon vows to teach him anyway, believing him to be the Chosen One, the one destine to bring balance to the force. Anakin accompanies Qui-Gon and his party back to Naboo where Jar Jar leads his Gungan tribes against the droid army, Padme and her forces talk to the Trade Federation leaders about a treaty, Qui-Gon and his padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi fight the evil Darth Maul, and Anakin is inadvertently hurled into the space fight just above Naboo. Qui-Gon is unfortunately killed by Darth Maul during the duel and Obi-Wan vows to teach Anakin, everyone celebrating the Trade Federation's demise as Anakin becomes Obi- Wan's padawan. The plot is complex, but simple to understand after a few viewings. This is the film that had the biggest shoes to fill, and although it left a few spots unfilled (until Episodes 2 and 3 came along), it answered a very pivotal question that plagued people's minds since Episode 6 when Anakin's backstory was touched upon for the first time. How exactly did Anakin become Obi-Wan's apprentice? It also established the trouble that would eventually lead to the Clone Wars and in time, the Galactic Civil War as seen in Episodes 4-6. The scheming Senator Palpatine, portrayed in this film as a kindly man, is pulling the strings and quietly planning out the events that will eventually lead him to become Emperor. And Ian McDiarmond prevails triumphantly playing the young Palpatine, lean and handsome before becoming mangled and hideous.Liam Neeson is also grand as Qui-Gon, a calm, collective and cool Jedi-Master who believes in the Living Force and that all creatures have a purpose. His apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, portrayed by Ewan Mcgregor, is the complete opposite, viewing many lifeforms as pathetic, although, as seen in Alec Guinness' take on Obi-Wan, his opinion would change overtime and this is what he teaches to Luke in the original trilogy. Padme, portrayed by Natalie Portman, is a pretty and sweet teenage girl, who's leadership skills make her stick out, which makes sense because it's revealed that she's the real queen. And Jar Jar, well, Jar Jar has his moments, but he's not the cinematic abomination he's often made out to be. There are also many other famous actors seen throughout the film, such as Samuel L. Jackson, Keira Knightley, Ray Park, Frank Oz and Anthony Daniels. Can you believe that young Vader built C-3P0? Other than a few minor aspects like puppet Yoda (which would later be replaced by digital Yoda), The Phantom Menace is a pretty good popcorn film and a great first entry in the always unfolding Star Wars saga, fully displaying the mythology and philosophy at the very heart of the series. I believe the message George Lucas was trying to get out was that even the galaxy's greatest enemies start out as good beings, optimistic beings that would go down a tragic path. Anakin Skywalker's path would become more tragic as Episode 2 and 3 would unfold. More on that next time.",9,7,10,4 March 2013
Iron Man 3," THE IRON MAN Christmas SPECIAL
","I was actually surprised that this film took place around the holiday season, similar to Batman Returns before it. But if you think the yuletide setting is enough to spoil this film, think again. Iron Man 3 is the best of the Iron Man trilogy and had a lot of elements that were even better than The Avengers. The first Iron Man was great, the second was a tad better (at least in my opinion), but the third just drove the nail further into the wood and not only gave us amazing action and suspense, but profound character development and soul as well. This is the darkest Iron Man flick and it's even a little jarring at times, but at the end of the day, Iron Man 3 is the perfect balance of humor, horror, suspense and overall excitement. It's a film any superhero buff would like, despite the tweaks and changes that were made to some characters that may get under hardcore comic gurus' skin. Robert Downey Jr. gives his best performance as Tony Stark in this film. He is still just as sarcastic and hilarious as ever, but in this film, we see his character go to a level we've never seen him at before. At the film's start, we see him torn apart and reclusive after the events of The Avengers and obsessed with building suit after suit. He has some of his best moments and some of the film's best lines, but his character is much more serious and dramatized this time around and he comes off as a tragic hero in many ways. He's a lot like Christian Bale's Batman, a determined, yet tortured hero that is deeply effected by the terrible events that unfold. Luckily, his character comes out of his shell towards the end of the film and, you guessed it, he saves the day. Big surprise.Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, but instead of being the clueless damsel she was in the previous films, she contributes to the action and even takes part in the film's climax. I liked seeing the feisty and rough side of her character and the fact that she takes out the main villain at the end makes her character as solid as a statue. Don Cheadle comes back as James Rhodes from Iron Man 2, this time around sporting red, white and blue armor instead of the classic War Machine silver and black. I'm not the biggest fan of Don Cheadle, but he's a decent actor and really shows his acting capabilities in this flick. He also delivers one of the film's best lines ('That's your department'). But the actor who steals the show, at least in my opinion is Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin. Holy cow, what a great adversary this is! I won't give too much away about his character, but let's just say that your jaw will drop once you discover a pivotal twist about him. One minute, he can be as terrifying as the Devil in The Exorcist, the next minute, he's a cheerful, quirky jokester with a love of soccer games on the television. Ben Kingsley really let it all out as the Mandarin, and he's one of the movie's most memorable players. But the movie really shines in the action department. This had the best action out of any other Iron Man film and in some areas, it had better action than The Avengers. I really liked the scenes where Tony went up against the explosive Extremis Soldiers and rescued all the senators from a desecrated aircraft in his Mark 47 armor. And the final scene involving all of Tony's different suits was one of the best scenes ever executed in a Marvel movie. Seeing Tony constantly switching suits and at one point, leaping into one as it soared through the sky, it really puts gas in your stomach and you really wish you could go out there and jump into a suit of armor yourself. The final fight against the Mandarin was also dazzling as you see the villain use his Extremis abilities to the fullest. It's also worth mentioning that Guy Pearce gives a slick, yet malevolent performance as Aldrich Killian and a brief appearance from a fellow Avenger in the after credits scene really makes the film come full circle. Iron Man 3 is one of the best films of the year. Hopefully, with upcoming films like Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, Marvel and Disney continue to give us high quality adventures that take us into alternate realms and send us on thrilling, chilling rides of exhilaration.",10,3,7,3 May 2013
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Mice and Rabbits Unite
","Growing up as a kid, I had this stuffed rabbit doll that I used to sleep with at night and carry around with me everywhere I went. Since I was young, I never really got the name of the rabbit until I saw this masterpiece of a film and was blown all the way to the moon. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not only a comical action packed suspense thriller, but a film which brings all our childhood fantasies to reality. Who didn't want to see Mickey Mouse interact with Bugs Bunny? Who didn't want to see Donald Duck throw Daffy Duck into a piano? Who didn't want to see Mary Poppins' penguins serving drinks in a nightclub? It's all stuff we imagined as youngsters, and this film brought it all together in a well paced, well put together, exciting, innovative, and most of all entertaining epic. It's undeniably one of my all time favorite animated films and one of my all time favorite films in general.I think what I love most about this movie is the way the human characters interact with the cartoon characters. The way Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) picks up Roger and tosses him in the sink, pretending to do his laundry, it's hilarious and impressive at the same time, and I still question how they were able to pull off such an effect. The way Jessica Rabbit dances around Marvin Acme, tugging on his cheeks and taking the hat off his head, it makes you think the cartoon characters are actually there and not inked animated creations superimposed over the film. I also like the scenes where the cartoons interact with human appliances. The scene where Roger is drinking, he's drinking from a real glass and he picks it up just like a flesh and blood human would. The scene where Roger is smashing plates over his head, he's smashing real plates and not animated cartoon ones. The scene where the Toon Patrol tracks down Eddie, they are wielding real guns and not cartoon ones. What's ironic is that the human Eddie would wield a cartoon gun later on in the film. This film has the perfect blend of slapstick, humor, drama, terror and straight forward fun, which makes sense for a film involving cartoon entities. I love some of the jokes seen throughout the motion picture and the puns spewed from the mouths of some of the characters really add a bit of comic relief, even in the film's most horrifying of scenes. I really love Charles Fleischer's voice work as Roger Rabbit, but would you believe Paul 'Pee-Wee Herman' Reubens originally auditioned for the voice. Although Reubens would have done a great job, I really dig Fleischer's voicing of the character, especially his PWWWWLLLEEEAASSSEEE! You gotta love that, for it's the character's most distinctive trademark and makes him stick out among other rabbit characters in the world of the Toons. Bob Hoskins is also phenomenal as Eddie Valiant and to this day, it's considered one of his best roles, although I'll always remember him for playing Mario Mario.But the actor who steals the show in my eyes is Christopher Lloyd as the slinky yet intimidating Judge Doom. Straight out of Back to the Future, Lloyd delivers a menacing performance that has you laughing and screaming in fright all at once. You really feel frightened by this dude, and although he is defeated in the end, he sticks out in your mind and has his cartoonish red eyes watching you in your dreams. He's just that chilling. Although the human/cartoon interaction and Lloyd are some of my favorite aspects of the film, my favorite moment of the film is the scene at the very end where the wall to Toon Town is broken and all our favorites come running out to get the spotlight. Literally, ALL our favorites are there. Mickey, Bugs, Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Donald, Daffy, Goofy, Yosemite Sam, Pinocchio, Droopy Dog, even Peter from Disney's adaptation of Peter and the Wolf somehow squeezes in a cameo. My only gripe is that my all time favorite cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry don't make an appearance, but that's just a miner nitpick.Overall, this is a perfect movie. This film clearly displays what films are made of or can be made of if a lot of hard work and ingenuity are put into them. This film clearly displays what fantasies and images of imagination are all about, and takes all the things we love about the Toons and blends them all together into one solid concoction. It also combines genres. One time it can be an action thriller, the other time it can be a romantic comedy, the other time it can be a horror film with Judge Doom drowning a Toon shoe in the horrid 'Dip'. It puts together a lot of stuff we love about the movies and when you set your eyes upon this film, no matter how many times you set your eyes upon it, your inner child is released and in no time, you feel like your in another dimension filled with flying elephants and reluctant dragons. AND DON'T FORGET THE FLOWERS AND TREES. This is a solid picture that I've seen so many times, and I still can't believe how magnificent it is.",10,0,0,25 February 2013
Star Trek," A Brilliant Revamp Of A Classic Series
","I'm a huge fan of Star Wars, that is no doubt, but I was always a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation which often aired on Spike TV or the CW during my schooldays. I was never really into the original Star Trek and never understand it as much as The Next Generation, but all of that would change once J.J. Abrams' reboot graced the screens. 2009's Star Trek is not only my favorite Star Trek film (that might change when Into Darkness comes out), but one of my favorite sci-fi films in general and it really delivers in so many areas which I'll cover as the review materializes. It is a fact that Abrams didn't create Star Trek, but the way he revisions it is really something breathtaking. He reimagines the worlds that Roddenberry incepted in a more modernized and stylized fashion and it fits for today's movie going and sci-fi loving audience. Hopefully, this is something that carries on when Abrams helms Star Wars: Episode 7 and let's hope that if Abrams includes lens flares in that film, he makes them work in their own right and doesn't make them distracting from the rest of the picture. Getting back to Star Trek, Abrams shows his talent for storytelling as well as his understanding of the Star Trek lore and mythos. Even though this is an entirely new Trek based on an old Trek, it still has that outgoing, adventurous Star Trek feeling that really makes it stand out from all the other films in the 11 (soon to be 12) film series. Simple put, this is a film Gene Roddenberry would be most proud of, for it showcases his brainchild in a new shell and in a new light. All our favorite Star Trek characters have their place with James Tiberius Kirk and Spock leading the pack. Of course, Kirk is more troublesome and slick in this version, but he still retains the leadership and benevolence of Shatner's Kirk and the ability to take on the command chair. Spock is also much more emotional and aggressive this time around, but still retains what made the character stand out to begin with and he even gets a few pointers from the old Spock, played brilliantly by the legendary Leonard Nimoy. All the other characters are spot on as well. Uhura is the sassy chick with a skill for communications, Bones is the ill tempered medical expert, Sulu is the high flying swordsman, Chekov is the mathematical wiz, and Scotty is the rambunctious engineer who loves to shout and run around like a loon. The main villain of the film, Nero, played by Eric Bana is also a highlight, delivering that perfect balance of tyranny and determination to take out the good guys. He's one dude you don't want to pee off and when you do, he'll impale you with his sharp staff of terror. As I said before, the great Nimoy is in this picture and he portrays the prime Spock in a dignified, wise manner. He tells his younger self to put aside logic and do what he feels is right and persuades him to stay in Starfleet, saying that he can't deprive him of his inevitable friendship with Kirk. The special effects and sound effects are also something to write home about. The man behind Star Wars' sound effects, Ben Burtt did the sound effects for this film and they are very Star Trek like and fitting for each scene they are in. The space battles sound like Star Trek space battles and when characters are beamed off the Enterprise, it's the classic transporter sound from the 60s TV show. I also like the Phaser sound effect, not exactly like the classic sound from the show, but really intriguing and sci-fi like. Instead of the fizzing sound from the original, this phaser sound effect is more of a solid clink or clank. I also admire the new design of the Enterprise, which is obviously much bigger and more advanced than the one in the original show. The bridge also doesn't have all those massive buttons and levers, it looks much more advanced and technological. Although this film is well loved, many Trekkies were offended by this flick, feeling that it was less of Star Trek and more of a mindless action flick. Abrams did however reboot the franchise in a way that it doesn't ignore the other Star Trek series, but you'll have to see the movie yourself to understand what I'm talking about. It really is an excellent movie and it doesn't require you to know about Star Trek to get into it. Hopefully, Abrams can carry on the same magic in the upcoming sequel, and fingers crossed that he will reboot The Next Generation. James Franco as Riker, anyone? Just kidding.",10,1,3,4 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," The Wrath of John Harrison
","Well, after four long years, we are finally getting a sequel to JJ Abrams' highly acclaimed Star Trek film from 2009. I must say, it's quite interesting that it too that long to bring forth a follow up, but were the four years worth the wait to see the further adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the USS Enterprise? You bet your bottom dollar! I personally think this sequel was superior to the first and delivered some of the finest moments in all of Star Trek. This film also paid homage to the Star Trek of yesteryear and revamped one of the franchise's most famous adversaries, the tyrannical superhuman Khan Noonien Singh. But we don't find out he is Khan until about half way through the film. In the beginning, Khan goes by the name John Harrison, a Starfleet officer recruited by Admiral Alexander Marcus to build advanced weapons and starships for the upcoming Klingon war. It is also revealed that Khan's blood has enhanced platelets that can cure almost any illness, foil any ailment or revive dead tissue. I loved the way Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed Khan, paying homage to the great Ricardo Montalban on several occasions but also bringing something new to the famous Trek baddie. He also has a magnificent, overpowering voice that's very reminiscent to Patrick Stewart, adding a bit of sinisterness and malevolence to an already malevolent villain. 'No ship should go down without her captain!'Returning from the previous film are of course Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Kirk and Spock respectively. The other crew members of the Enterprise also return and a new blondie named Carol Marcus joins the band, but Kirk and Spock are front and center and are the film's main focus. The relationship between the two is the film's best element. The relationship between Kirk and Spock is the highlight of any Star Trek episode or movie, but in this film, you can really see how these two characters relate to one another or get at each other's throats in certain perils. Kirk is also annoyed by Spock's logical statements and beliefs, giving the film a teaspoon of comic relief and humor only available through human and Vulcan association. Speaking of comic relief, Mccoy, Scotty and Chekov get a lot of funny moments in the film. Uhura of course shows off her skills as communications officer while chatting with a Klingon and Sulu shows off his gallant command skills while hunting down Khan. And once Khan is aboard the Enterprise, he relentlessly taunts Kirk about killing his crew and how he is better at 'everything'. I love the way Khan sees right through Kirk and knows what will bring Kirk to his knees. He surely knew what would take Kirk down in The Wrath of Khan, which is one of the many reasons why it is many Trekkies' favorite Star Trek flick. I should also mention the great performance of Peter Weller (aka Robocop) as the secondary villain, Admiral Marcus, who comes off as a pompous string puller who believes a war is coming and that all should be prepared for it's consequences. The plot of the film is different from most Trek flicks, but it still has that Star Trek feeling if you ask me and brings in a lot of elements from the movies, TV shows and even the animated series to make a slushy of awesomeness. I do believe Star Trek Into Darkness is my favorite of the 12 Star Trek films, from it's Indiana Jones inspired opening to it's Wrath of Khan inspired ending. I hope JJ can crank out one more Star Trek flick before setting his coordinates to Star Wars Episode 7, but one can never be too sure. Into Darkness was certainly a sequel worth waiting for and a great love letter to Roddenberry's brainchild.It also has a spectacular cameo by Leonard Nimoy. That alone makes the film worth going to see at warp speed.",10,8,20,20 May 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," I Don't Think It's Dreadful
","Oh boy, now we get to the X-flick many seem to spit upon. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a spin off and a prequel to the previous three films of the series, and while it's not my favorite of the series, it still has it's ups as well as downs. I'm going to come right out and say that I enjoyed this one a bit more than I did X-Men: The Last Stand. Many of the problems I had with The Last Stand I didn't have with this film, and the overall tone and feeling of this spin off was a bit more satisfying than the one in the previous film. But that doesn't mean the film is flawless, for there are many flaws present in the film that I will touch upon as my review progresses. One of the reasons I liked X2 so much is because we got a brief glimpse of Wolverine's backstory, which has been shrouded in obscurity since X1. In this film, we see his origins head on, and I think it's my favorite aspect out of the entire film. Seeing Wolverine and his stepbrother Victor aka Sabretooth fight throughout all the major World Wars, it really shows why the two of them are as angry as we know them as. Seeing Wolverine get injected with blazing hot adamantium, it really puts gas in your stomach and you can almost feel the unbearable pain Wolvy had to endure during that dreadful procedure. And seeing Wolverine get his memories wiped away with an adamantium bullet, it tied all the loose ends and explained the very reason why he didn't know who he was in the previous three films. After all, the entire point of a prequel is to explain why things are the way they are in the films that came before. Why do you think the Star Wars prequels are caked with rich, yet complex stories? Because they have a lot of questions to answer. The acting, like in the previous three films, is very wooden at times, but I will say that it has improved drastically, especially with Ryan Reynolds in the film's ranks. He is spot on as Deadpool, and although he would later go on to play Hal Jordan in the Green Lantern movie, he seems to embody Wade Wilson perfectly. It's too bad that they had to turn him into a mouthless, silent drone with adamantium blades protruding from his wrists. They might as well have brought in Baraka from Mortal Kombat. It wouldn't have made much sense, but at least they wouldn't have butchered the trademarks of a beloved comic book character. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is brilliant as always, and Liev Schreiber was pretty cool as Sabretooth, although his appearance is different than the one in X1, thus creating an unresolved plothole. Maybe Sabretooth had some plastic surgery before X1 that gave him blonde hair and black eyes. Maybe it's a different Sabretooth. Who knows? There are many other mutants present in the film, but with so many characters, we run into the same problem we had with X3. Some characters are killed off anti-climatically, others don't get enough screen time or development. I did like Will.i.am as the teleporting mutant John Wraith, portraying him as a wise cracking, sarcastic cowboy like character. But he surely bites the dust very quickly and his character doesn't seem to have that much dimension beside his snarky attitude. Taylor Kitsch was perfect for the role of Gambit, but his appearance in the film was limited to only a few scenes. And Danny Huston's take on William Stryker was just not on par with Bryan Cox's portrayal of the character in X2, as Huston portrayed Stryker as a pathetic, cowardly adversary rather than a cunning, scheming opposer. That doesn't mean all the casting is bad, for Lynn Collins was triumphant as Wolvy's love interest Kayla Silverfox and Tim Pocock was decent as young Scott Summers/Cyclops, helping the mutants escape Stryker's lab and get recruited by Charles Xavier in one of Patrick Stewart's finest cameos. One of the film's prominent highlights is the action. Though it's not on par with the action of X2, it still packs a punch and I think the fight between Baraka Deadpool, Wolverine and Sabretooth towards the end was one of the saga's best fights. I also must point out that the effects have improved very much since the first X-Men film, although, as many have pointed out, Wolverine's metal claws look very computer animated at times, especially in the scene where he extends his claws in front of the bathroom mirror. However, the effects do shine in the scenes where Cyclops shoots his optic blasts or when Emma Frost activates her diamond skin. And when John Wraith and Drone Deadpool teleport, you get a brief glimpse of their skeleton as they teleport away. So as you can see, there are many things I enjoy about X-Men Origins: Wolverine and as I said before, I think this one is a tad better than The Last Stand. Of course, we all have our different opinions, and I think that, for a prequel to one of the highest grossing superhero series of all time, Wolverine did a fairly good job. From what I understand, a sequel is on the way this summer. Let's hope the filmmakers are able to capture the same magic this film was able to bring forward.",8,1,3,4 March 2013
X-Men," The Film That Got Me In The X-Men Mood
","I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of X-Men growing up in the late 90s early 2000s. I fell more into the crowd of Spider-Man, Power Rangers and Harry Potter fanatics. But then I saw Bryan Singer's X-Men, the live action adaptation of the comic book of the same name. Immediately, I was hooked and since then, I have become a hardcore X-Men buff, watching all the cartoon series (with the exception of Wolverine and the X-Men) and even breezing through some of the comics. X-Men takes place in a time of mutant discrimination and protesting. On the good side, there is Charles Xavier, the leader of the X-Men who believes that mutants and humans can live together in harmony. On the bad side, there is Magneto, the leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants who believes a war is coming between mankind and mutant kind. Charles and Magneto are very similar to real life civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen do a magnificent job portraying their respective characters. In my opinion, it's one of Stewart's best roles since Jean-Luc Picard and Ebenezer Scrooge. In the heat of all this tension and travesty, Xavier's X-Men get themselves into quite a few confrontations with Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. Of course there are several members on both teams so everyone can have their favorite heroes and baddies. There's the optic blasting Cyclops, the weather witch Storm, the telepathic Jean Grey, the power absorbing Rogue, and of course, the adamantium claw clashing bub, Wolverine. On the enemy side, there is the hairy beast Sabretooth, the long tongued Toad, and the blue, shapeshifting Mystique. All these characters are just as classic in the movie as they are in the comics, although I believe that some of the characters should have had a little bit more character development and a tad more dimension. Some of the acting is wooden, yes, but that's not enough for me to totally despise the movie. It has a lot of things to love, and every time I watch, I find something I have never seen before in previous viewings. I like to think of this movie as an end of the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s movie, setting the stage for more superhero flicks to follow. X-Men does indeed have some dated elements (like some of the special effects), but when you get right down to it, it's just a fun, entertaining, action packed, high flying thrill ride that has you captivated all the way to the end credits. This is the film that got me into the X-Men mood, and I was pumped up for more, and although the X-Men franchise has had it's share of scrutinized elements, it still has things I go absolutely wild over. Sure X2 and X-Men: First Class came along to take the place of my favorite X-flick, but I always look back at this film and say 'X-Men, what an experience this movie is'. And this would only be the beginning of a new age of superhero silver screen successes. WE ARE THE FUTURE, CHARLES.",9,0,1,12 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Anakin's Story Continues
","Ten years after The Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker is the rambunctious apprentice to Obi- Wan Kenobi. The two of them confront Padme after several years as they are informed that several assassination attempts occurred trying to claim her life. As Anakin is assigned to protect Padme, the two of them are shipped off to Naboo while Obi-Wan tries to track down the ones responsible, leading him to Kamino where a massive clone army is being built. Meanwhile, Anakin continues having nightmares about his mother and heads to Tatooine to save her, meeting his step brother Owen Lars and his step father Cliegg Lars, who informs him that she was abducted by Tusken Raiders. Going to the Tusken Raider village, he talks to his mom for the first time in a long time, just before she dies, sending Anakin in a rage and causing him to massacre the entire village. At the same time, Obi-Wan is lead to Geonosis where he discovers that the wicked Count Dooku is behind the attacks on Padme's life. As Obi-Wan is captured, Anakin and Padme go to rescue him, unwillingly getting thrust into the battle droid manufacturing plant.They too are eventually captured by Dooku's enforcer, Jango Fett (Boba Fett's daddy-o) and are to be executed at the mouths of several wild Genosian creatures. Eventually, the jedi arrive and take on the incoming battle droids, then Yoda comes with the Clone Army, then Anakin and Obi-Wan take on Dooku, then Anakin gets his arm cut off, then Yoda comes in to kick Dooku's tush, then Anakin and Padme get married, then the Clone Wars begin.If the plot of Episode II: Attack of the Clones sounds complicated, that's because it is. I think it's the most complex and befuddling of the saga, but that doesn't mean in the slightest that it is horrendous. In fact, it's a tad superior than The Phantom Menace, at least in my book. It has some of the best oohs and aahs out of the entire prequel trilogy, and seeing Yoda pull out a green saber is enough to make this film worth wild for me. As a kid, I always wanted to see him fight like a jedi, and seeing him do so in this film was like a fantasy come true. Some will argue that him using a lightsaber goes against all the wisdom he spoke of in The Empire Strikes Back, but you gotta remember that takes place many years after Attack of the Clones. Yoda's perspective has changed drastically by that point, and when he says 'War does not make one great', he's talking out of experience. There are many other things in this film that fill me with glee. Seeing Obi-Wan put up a fight with Jango Fett on Kamino's rainy surface, it was one of Obi-Wan's greatest moments out of the entire saga. Seeing a feisty and ambitious young Boba Fett before he puts on the Mandalorian armor, it added so much depth to his character and made him a bit more understandable in Empire and Jedi, especially after Mace Windu's purple lightsaber meets his father Jango's neck, decapitating him. Seeing Padme in beautiful, revealing gowns, it made many of us guys drool like dogs. Anakin's one lucky dude.Speaking of Anakin, one of the biggest complaints about Clones is that he is too whiny. Hayden Christensen gets picked on by so much by critics and members of the media for his portrayal of pre-Vader. But just stop and think for a while. Anakin is about 19-20 years old in this film. He has grown up, and is dealing with a lot of the things us teenagers deal with in real life. When we first met him in Phantom, he was an optimistic, dreaming little fellow who was looking forward to becoming a jedi. Now, 10 years have gone by, and the life of a jedi has torn him apart. He wants power, he wants to break free from the shackles the jedi have him in, he wants to do things no person has ever done before. Anakin's transformation in Clones really shows how someone can be torn apart by their dreams and want to undo everything they did in the past. Hayden Christensen really hits the nail right on the head, capturing Anakin's innocence, arrogance, and lust for unnatural abilities. But I think that Christopher Lee's Count Dooku really steals the show and comes off as a space version of his famous Dracula character from the Hammer Horror films. I think Dooku is the most wicked out of all the Sithlords in these films, even more wicked than Vader and Maul. He just has that electrifying presence every time he enters the room and when he pulls out that curved lightsaber and shoots his lightning bolts, you can tell he's gonna do business, and that business is not going to be good. I also must praise Ewan Macgregor as Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman as Padme, for their performances have really improved since the last film and they seem to fit more into their roles in this film. And kudos to Samuel L. Jackson for kicking a lot of droid behind in the Geonosian arena with his purple lightsaber. Although the special effects can be rubbery at times, they really look appealing and fantasy like. The effects on the clones, the digital Yoda, the Geonosians, the republic spacecrafts and gunships, they bring in a retro appeal and stick out tremendously among all the other scenery in the film. Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones may very well be the most visually appealing out of the entire saga, and when you watch this film, you instantly get sucked into the film's many environments and become part of the action and suspense.",9,6,9,5 March 2013
Man of Steel," Not One of My All Time Favorites, But Still Worth a Watch
","Growing up, I was always in the Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men and Power Rangers kinda crowd. When it came to the big guy with the 'S' on his chest, I thought he was cool but I never really gravitated towards him as I did with the Caped Crusader and the Wall Crawler. Nevertheless, he was still an awesome character and I could see why he was considered an American icon as well as the pinnacle of the superhero genre. When it came to movies based on Superman, it's quite obvious what zooms to the mind first. Richard Donner's Superman flicks are fun movies even if there are some elements that are extremely outdated and Christopher Reeve solidified Mr. Sups and made the role synonymous with his name. 3 and 4 of the series are admittedly guilty pleasures just like 3 and 4 of the Batman series and Superman Returns, well, it's not Citizen Kane but I liked it better than most. Now comes a reboot of the Last Son of Krypton, straight from the mind that brought us the on screen adaptations of 300 and Watchmen. Did Zach Snyder prevail with his reimagining or did it all go down the crapper. Well, the latter certainly isn't true, but Man of Steel is not one of my personal favorites. It's a good movie, far from being one of the worst, but there are several flaws that I think should have been improved upon. But there are certainly tons of goodies thrown in there as well that make Man of Steel entertaining as well as satisfying to the average movie goer. Hans Zimmer's score for the film is just as exciting and memorable as John Williams' classic score for the Donner films and if you are a sucker for CGI effects, you'll be captivated by the film's eye candy and brilliant imagery.The planet Krypton is a marvelous place. It's like Pandora from Avatar, only darker and more mechanized. Some of the technology on Krypton is amazing to look at and makes me wish we had technology like that on Earth. I also liked Russell Crowe as Sups' father Jor-El. If only he had a singing number or two (just kidding). Crowe portrays Jor-El very similar to Brando, but with a little more edge and agility never seen in the character before. The scene where he engages in a fight with the film's villain, General Zod is suspenseful and one of the film's best action scenes. It's a pity though that he couldn't fight alongside his son in the film's climax. That would have been spectacular. Nevertheless, Crowe's Jor-El is one of the film's best players and the wise father figure that guides the hero through his journey.The other actors are okay. They have their moments of blandness, but they get the job done. Henry Cavill did a good job of filling Reeve's red boots and there's just something about the guy that makes him a great Superman for a new era. He's got edginess like his dad and a determination to take out the invading Kryptonians, but his character development is all over the place. One minute, he's a fisherman, the next minute, he's a nine year old boy saving his classmates from drowning in a school bus. I wish these scenes could have been sorted out more and put in order, for it would have helped us to understand the character a little bit better. Michael Shannon as General Zod is a decent superhero foe, but he just comes off as an abused war general kinda villain that is driven insane because he can't defeat the main hero. I was also disappointed that he didn't shout 'Kneel Before Zod' anywhere in the film. Come on, if Terence Stamp could do it, Michael Shannon certainly could. Amy Adams, Lawrence Fishburne and Kevin Costner, there pretty good as well, but they lacked a bit of character development that could have made their characters a bit more relatable.The action, it's pretty darn monotonous. Sometimes it's so fast, you can't even depict what's going on. I think it will give people a headache or make their eyes pop out of their skulls. Sups and Zod hurl into buildings at thousands of miles per hour, no doubt killing many innocent civilians in the process. And the fact that Zod becomes a psychopathic slaughterer that wants to kill all humanity, it just comes off a bit clichéd. Luckily, Sups snaps his neck like a tree branch, has a good scream and is comforted by Lois. He then goes on to work at the Daily Planet and puts on those corny glasses that somehow conceal his true alias. The End. The film's climax feels a bit rushed and hackneyed and I think a few more touches could have made it much more iconic and memorable. Still, it's fun to watch and a sweet Easter Egg can be spotted when Sups and Zod brawl in space.So there's my review of Man of Steel. Not a groundbreaking piece of cinema, but certainly worth two and a half hours. Looks like a Superman/Batman crossover is coming up next, so I'll certainly give that a watch when it arrives.

Edward Scissorhands," Burton's Magnum Opus
","Here we go, Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton himself has gone on record saying that this is the work he is most proud of, for it captures the very nature of what his films are all about. Whatever his perspective is on the film, this masterpiece is certainly my favorite of his filmography and for various reasons. For one, it was the first collaboration between Burton and Johnny Depp, and this relationship still lasts to this very day. Depp has been the main player in many of Burton's flicks and it's hard to imagine some of the movies without him. Second, it marked the swan song for one of my all time favorite actors, the master of macabre Vincent Price, who Tim Burton had idolized since youth. He even made a short film about Vincent Price in 1982, fittingly entitled Vincent. Third, the film hearkens back to the 1931 Frankenstein film and makes the mad scientist's creation sympathetic and pitiful. Fourth, the main character of Edward is such a whacky yet contemporary character that I can't help but relate to him at times. Then again, I think we can all relate to Edward Scissorhands from time to time.The film constantly shifts atmospheres, but it works greatly in this flick. One minute, it can be a dark, Gothic horror related atmosphere, the next, it's the bright, sunny and upbeat suburban neighborhood. The film also has one of the all time greatest film scores, performed brilliantly by Danny Elfman, who's Ice Dance score fills me with butterflies every time I set my ears to it. One time, when I was younger, a saw snow falling outside on a cold winter's night, but the darkness didn't stop me from seeing each individual snowflake. I immediately thought of the Ice Dance theme. It's the very epitome of a beautiful tune. In fact, all the film's compositions are great, especially the theme that plays in the opening credits of the movie where we see a montage of the old inventor's lab equipment. Perhaps my favorite scene out of the entire movie is the scene where Edward sees a can opener and has a flashback of the inventor's cookie making machine. The inventor, played by Vincent Price walks in, marvels at his contraption, takes a heart shaped cookie and holds it up to the chest of the lettuce slicing robot that would later be transformed into Edward himself. It's a very touching moment and shows just how great ideas can be born from great minds. The acting in the film is also something worth writing a book or two about. Johnny Depp's debut in a Burton film is probably his best. Even if he has little dialogue, Depp makes up his performance through his body language and movements. Depp based the movements of Edward off of Charlie Chaplin and it really shows, for several scenes show Edward waddling about and making facial expressions the Tramp himself would make. My favorite line of his from the film is after the neighbor Joyce (played by Kathy Baker) tries to seduce him in the beauty salon and he meets up with the Boggs family in a nearby restaurant. When asked by the father (played by Alan Arkin) on how his day went at the beauty salon, Edward tells him that Joyce lead him into the back room where she 'took all of her clothes off'. The delivery and the way Depp says the line makes it not only the most humorous line out of the film, but also the most perfectly time line out of the film. The other players are also grandiose with Anthony Michael Hall taking a break from playing the nerdy wise guy in John Hughes films and instead playing the dirtbag jock who torments Edward throughout most of the film. Winona Ryder, straight from Burton's Beetlejuice is also the apple of Edward's eye and comes off as the pretty girl many boys her age would love to date. But one of the main reasons why I love this film to pieces is that it was Vincent Price's last and arguably his best performance in a motion picture. He plays the role of the inventor as a kind hearted, noble fellow who was on the verge of creating a creation like no other. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, he's not an insane fellow obsessed with his work, he's just a kind gentleman with a passion to build things and enjoy the very things he constructs. The scene where he passes is a heartbreaking scene, for he was about to give Edward normal hands, ridding him of the sharp scissorhands he was bound too for so long. Still, Price is a child at heart in this film and his performance sums up his entire career in the Gothic horror/macabre genre. The scene in which he teaches etiquette to Edward is a memorable scene that will have you laughing and tearing up all at once.What more can I say about the movie, it's magnificent. Sure, some may question where Edward got the ice for the ice sculptures at the very end, but that's a glaring issue. Edward Scissorhands brings us the best humor, the best imaginative elements and the best performances out of any other Burton film. Some think of it as a retelling of Shelley's Frankenstein, others say it's ET, I consider it a collage of many things, both from the horror and fantasy genres as well as the works of 19th century authors and their tales of weird beings and creatures of the night. And like I said earlier, I relate a lot to Edward, for he was a outcast, like I am an outcast, like we are all outcasts in certain times of our lives.",10,7,9,15 June 2013
Spider-Man," Who Am I? I'm Spider-Man
","If there is one superhero I relate to the most, it's the web slinging Spider-Man. Ever since I was a kid, this red and blue, wall crawling arachnid has also been the superhero I saw myself in, the superhero I can see myself portraying. When the 2002 film starring Tobey Maguire came along, I was as excited as a leprechaun locked in a chamber full of beer. This superb superhero flick is up there on my favorite superhero film list and even if sequels have come along as well as a stellar reboot, this film still holds a special place in my heart. This is a shining jewel in the comic book based movie category and when it comes to Spidey films, this is a feast fit for any Spidey fan. The comic book look and feel of the film must be praised. Sam Raimi and his team surely came through in delivering a great comic panel to silver screen transition and making us feel like we were watching a comic book come to life. From the New York skyscrapers to the abandoned warehouse to the film's web slinging scenes, you really feel like your sucked into the motion picture and every, jaw dropping moment. You feel like a piece of the pie, and this film is a pie that will make any comic book guru go bonkers. This film hearkens back to the great Steve Ditko stories of the golden age of comics and really delivers a scope and feeling of epicness. Spider- Man is mighty and the actor portraying him is radical. Tobey Maguire gives us a more serious Spider-Man than the wise cracking one seen in the panels of the comics, but he still has a touch of humor here and there and really fits in Spidey's shoes perfectly. When it comes to playing Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, Tobey also hits a home run and really portrays him as an average ordinary everyday teenager. Many people, including myself can relate to Maguire's take on Parker/Spidey, for he plays him as a realistic, determined fellow just trying to make his way in the world. William Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, giving us a menacing and hilarious villain who loves being villainous. I will admit, his costume is a bit ridiculous, but it's not the worst I've ever seen. It's a lot better looking than Halle Berry's Catwoman, that's for sure! The other actors are also good in their aliases. James Franco is a rebellious, yet headstrong Harry Osborn and Rosemary Harris is a sweet, grandmotherly Aunt May (More wheat cakes, Petey?). Kirsten Dunst is as Mary Jane as you can get, although she can be a little petulant at times, especially in the later films. And of course, the great Bruce Campbell in all his glory makes an appearance. Him and Sam Raimi are like peanut butter and jelly, and Campbell always knows how to make his cameos work, giving us brief, yet funny and memorable moments. Did anyone see his cameo in the latest Oz movie? Overall, Spider-Man is a fun, whirling and twirling action packed suspense thriller that will have you entangled in it's awesomeness ever second. Honestly, I could sit here for countless hours talking about the grand action scenes, the iconic dialogue, and the cheesy, yet comic book inspired special effects, but IMDb has a limit, and I gotta keep it short. Spider-Man is just a head spinning ride of unexpectedness and epicness, but doesn't hold a candle to the sequel that would follow two years later. We'll get to that one some other time.",9,0,1,7 April 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," A New Spider-Man For A New Time Period
","Just recently, I did a review of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man from 2002. Now, I think it would be cool to have a look at the most recent reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, directed by Marc Webb. After highly praising Spider-Man for it's comic book feeling scope and great take on the classic characters, what do I think of the revamp of my favorite superhero? I loved it, simply put. Sure, people will be comparing this one to the original, but to be honest, I really can't compare the two. I love them both evenly, but we are not here to compare the 2002 film and the 2012 film, we are here to talk about the 2012 reboot solely. So let's get started, shall we? Refill your web shooters, climb up the nearest wall and enjoy the review.I think what I like most about this film is that it combines the modern day Spider-Man with the Spider-Man of the past. As the original Spider-Man film was much like the Steve Ditko era comics, this film is a lot like the Ultimate Spider-Man stories from the last decade. There is a much more modernized look to the film and the characters act like real life people do nowadays. For example, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spidey is a much more sarcastic, outspoken fellow who does what a lot of teens do these days. He explores, he gets into it with his aunt and uncle, he listens to music, and he skateboards. He's a lot like the modern day teen, rebellious and free, just like all of us are in one way or another. This film also borrows key elements from the golden era, some elements that were even missing from the original Raimi film. Garfield's Spider-Man wields web shooters instead of organic webs and has his trademark sarcastic nature and attitude. Peter also has his first female flame from the comics, Gwen Stacy, who is portrayed by Emma Stone. She is a much more determined and headstrong female lead than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane in the previous films, who always sat around, complaining about how Peter didn't support her or how Peter didn't care about her. I also liked Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors aka the Lizard, who comes off as a good man who just wanted to make a difference, but it ultimately turned him into a human reptile killing machine. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were also spectacular as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, and Dennis Leary is incredible as Gwen's father, Captain George Stacey. Unlike his comic book counterpart, Stacey despises Spider-Man and it takes him until the end of the film to finally trust him as the hero he really is. The Amazing Spider-Man is simply put, a New Spider-Man for a New Time Period. The audience who grew up with the original Raimi film are now much older, and a new audience will come in to cherish and savor this new take on the colorful hero. Some people who watched the original might even like this one better, for their opinions and perspectives have changed throughout the years. But I like both Spider-Man films and I hope that, in this new series of Spider-Man flicks, they keep the juices flowing and make Spider-Man retain what we admire him for.Oh, and one more thing. I like the look of Spidey's suit. It actually looks like something an average teenager would stitch together in a matter of minutes. Way to keep the film diverse from the original, Webb! The Amazing Spider-Man is an exciting treat overall.",9,3,6,7 April 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Do Not Talk To Me Of Dragon Fire!
","Okay, I have to admit, when I first heard that the Hobbit was going to be split into three movies, I was a bit skeptical. Why is Peter Jackson taking Tolkien's shortest book and chopping it apart like sushi? If he was doing that, he should have split each Lord of the Rings story into three movies. But I will admit, An Unexpected Journey was a fun, entertaining adventure, even if it dragged in a few sections, and The Desolation of Smaug, while it had a similar problem, ultimately proved to be a stronger film. Much like The Empire Strikes Back and Judgment Day before it, The Desolation of Smaug is one of those sequels that can be argued to be better or just as good as it's predecessor. The second chapter of the Hobbit trilogy, like the first film, takes a good chunk of Tolkien's original tale and expands upon it, adding new characters, subplots and action to make the world of the Hobbit much more broad. All our favorite characters return as this flick picks up where the last left off. There's Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Fili, Kili, Bofur, Bombur, Dopey, Sleepy, Happy, Doc....oh sorry, wrong movie...oh you get the picture. And Martin Freeman is just as believable as ever while portraying Bilbo, the wielder of the One Ring and the unexpected hero to save the dwarfs' behinds. Ian McKellan's Gandalf is spectacular as always and it was great to see him kick Necromancer rump in Dol Guldur. Then there's Orlando Bloom, putting on his elf ears once more and wielding his bow as Legolas, the wisecracking, showoff elf. He's accompanied by a female elf named Tauriel, who throughout the film, develops a bit of a relationship with dwarf Kili. Just imagine what the children will look like! I also liked Doctor Who star Sylvester Mccoy as Radaghast, who is an expert at building bird nests on top of his head. There's also the quick and wise Thrandueil, Bard the Bowman, the skin changer Beorn, a couple of giant spiders and the giant lizard himself, Smaug. Portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan from Star Trek Into Darkness), Smaug is as intimidating as he is massive and no where near as ridiculous as his 1970s Rankin Bass counterpart. This Smaug is scary and sure to make all kiddies in the theater wet their underoos. Every time I heard that dark, raspy voice, I wanted to flee to the bedroom closet and snuggle with Mr. Cuddles. He's one of the greatest and scariest dragons ever portrayed on film. Hiccup, you and Toothless better avoid this dragon! The look of the film is dazzling, from the golden piles in Smaug's chambers to the foggy, glowing glow of Laketown, to the claustrophobic, cluttered land of the elves. And Dol Guldur, home of Sau...I mean the Necromancer is like a spooky cemetery or haunted burial ground. And don't expect to get a happy ending with this flick. The ending to the Desolation of Smaug is as bittersweet as it is terrifying and let's hope that when There and Back Again arrives in 2014, all loose ends will be tied and Bilbo can return to his cozy little home at Bag End and overtime, turn into the dude from Alien 1. The Desolation of Smaug was fun, more fun than An Unexpected Journey, although that film is still worth a dozen views. Let's hope There and Back Again is the perfect conclusion to this awesome trilogy and leads into The Fellowship of the Ring just as well as Revenge of the Sith lead into A New Hope.",9,1,6,20 January 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," I've Never Seen A Film Quite Like This
","Anyone who has read my review of Who Framed Roger Rabbit knows how bonkers I am over that film, but to be honest, I've longed for another film where many famous icons of popular culture unite. Wreck It Ralph was the film I have longed for and in my mind, it's high on the list of best computer animated flicks. This film has one of the most original stories I have ever seen, some of the most likable characters I have ever seen, and some of the best quarks I have ever seen put to film. As a gamer and a lover of films with imaginative qualities, this was a math class daydream come true, and after seeing this film on a cold winter's day, I couldn't be more happier with what I was putting my eyes to. It's like if Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Toy Story got together and had a baby, with video game characters. Wreck It Ralph is one of those films I could definitely sit through a million times plus a billion. First off, if you are going into the film expecting to see Mario and Sonic as the main heroes, you will be mighty disappointed. In fact, Sonic only makes a brief cameo and Mario doesn't even make an appearance, although he is mentioned by Fix-It Felix Jr. towards the beginning of the film. The main hero, I mean villain, I mean hero/villain is Wreck It Ralph, the nemesis of the arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. who wants to become good and get a medal. He embarks on a quest throughout many arcade games including the first person shooter Hero's Duty and the racing game Sugar Rush. While trapped within the Sugar Rush game, Ralph befriends a glitch named Vanellope Von Schweetz and vows to help her win a race. Meanwhile, Fix-It Felix Jr. goes looking for Ralph and teams up with the female general from Hero's Duty, Sergeant Calhoun as the two develop an odd, yet whimsical romance that is both comedic and satisfying. What I go absolutely nuts over in this movie is the many references to the famous arcade games of the 80s and 90s. There are cameos from Dig Dug and a Pooka, the Pong sticks, Q-Bert, Peter Pepper from Burger Time, Ryu and Ken from the Street Fighter franchise, Yuni Verse from Dance Dance Revolution, and everyone's favorite yellow chomper, Pikachu! Nah, just kidding, it's Pac-Man. I love that Root Beer Tapper is an actual bar where the video game characters hang out after a long day of fighting sausages and eating ghosts that turn blue. That is brilliant! I love that the evil King Candy uses the Konami Code to get into his secret layer. That is a perfect nod to the gamers of the 80s! I love that Q-Bert talks in gibberish and his iconic word balloons come up. That is ingenious beyond ingenious! This is certainly a film for all the gamers out there, the young and the old, the old gamers and the new gamers. But I think the thing I savor most in this movie is the gags in the Sugar Rush world. When Fix-It Felix Jr. and Calhoun go looking for Ralph in the candy forest, they fall into Nes-quik sand only to be saved by Laughy Taffy that expand as they laugh. One of King Candy's henchmen is a green lozenge that gets a lollipop stuck to him by the end of the film. And the palace of King Candy is a powerful threat, especially when Oreo guards are watching the territory, chanting O-Reo, Yum, Yum in a tribute to the Winkie guards in The Wizard of Oz. I literally peed myself watching that part, and it has stuck out in my mind as the most memorable aspect of the film. There are a lot of cheesy references to candy and sweets throughout the film, but I think the unique and diverse plot is where the film really soars. I'm not going to give too much away, but I will say that it's unlike any other plot in any other movie. It's different, it's well thought out, it's fitting for a film about video games, and I dig it. There is also a slight twist towards the end of the film that I really wasn't expecting, but it delivered when it came around and I say kudos to the filmmakers for such a clever revelation. It was almost as dramatic as when Darth Vader revealed himself to be Luke Skywalker's father! What a jaw dropper.Wreck It Ralph is the best video game movie ever made. Sure, some people will compare it to other video game related films like the infamous 1993 Super Mario Bros film, but from the way I see it, it clearly shows what we love about games and what we don't like about games. The characters die and come back again just like we always do while pushing the buttons of a controller. The film dwells on the catchy and the not so catchy aspects of games and overall showcases how elements of fantasy worlds can come together to form one big fantasy world. The only thing I can really complain about in this movie is that it leaves you wanting more. You want to see what happens to these characters next and you still want to be entangled in the film's pixelated worlds by the time the credits roll. But like Roger Rabbit, this is a lovely film to behold, a lovely film that takes you out of reality and puts you in the depths of a stylized, imaginative world. This is up there with the Pixar films as some of Disney's best classics, and if you are a gamer and an overall lover of motion pictures, this is a delicious candy apple you just have to sink your teeth into.",10,2,3,25 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Blunt the Knives, Bend the Forks
","A lot of people were skeptically when it was announced that Peter Jackson was taking JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit and turning it into a trilogy. Why take the shortest book out of the four book series and turn it into three movies is beyond me, but the first installment in the Hobbit trilogy is perhaps my second favorite out of the Jackson film adaptations, right behind The Fellowship of the Rings, which takes home the grand prize for it's upbeat nature and wholesome Middle Earthiness. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey received a mixed reception when it got released, some saying it was an entertaining blockbuster in the heart of good adventure stories, some saying it was as bad as Battlefield Earth. But I think it's good popcorn and nacho fun and if you want to kill a Saturday afternoon by watching a movie, then this might be your flick. I'm a big fan of LOTR films with good humor, action, character development and wonder (which is one of the many reasons why I hold Bakshi's LOTR at such high regards), so I thought this film was grand for what it was. After all, we have not seen a motion picture that takes place in Middle Earth for nearly ten years. Some complained about the special effects and Jackson's controversial use of 48 fps, but this didn't bother me all that much while watching the film. I will say that the film has scenes of fast pace and scenes that leave you out of breath, but this factor is meant to intensify the whole movie experience. It is there to make you feel like you are right there with the characters and experiencing the adventures they are hurled into and although some things seem a bit out of place, the film does have a nice look to it and a great atmosphere to be engulfed in. I love the look of the Shire, for it has such a woodsy, fragrant and greenery appeal to it and makes me want to live there, eating vegetables and smoking the 'finest weed in the Southfarthing' with the Hobbits. The look of Rivendell (the land of the elves) is also lovely to behold and something reminiscent of a ancient fairy tale land or a land straight out of a classic Disney film.Now let's talk about the characters. Martin Freeman may not look exactly like Sir Ian Holm, but he has Bilbo Baggins' distinct personality and characteristics down to a tee. When he runs about the Shire shouting 'I'm going on an adventure!', it sums up his outlook and trademarks flawlessly and reminds us of the timid, yet optimistic Bilbo in Tolkien's original novel. He also delivers funny lines during the troll scene, which is arguably the most hilarious sequence in all Lord of the Rings. Sir Ian McKellen pulls off Gandalf the Grey flawlessly, even if he hasn't played that version of Gandalf in almost 12 years. When the other characters are in turmoil, he always knows when to show up and work wonders with his wooden stick of might. All 13 of the dwarfs are reminiscent of the dwarfs in Disney's Snow White and know just how much butt to kick when vicious abominations and creatures show up to start trouble. They are liable to get a few chuckles out of the audience, for like Bilbo, they have quirky dialogue and perfectly timed one liners. The other actors are also exemplary in their respected roles. Christopher Lee can still pull of Saruman at an impressive 90 years old and Hugo Weaving is still a triumphant Elrond with a deep, kingly voice. Perhaps the funniest characters out of the entire film are the corpulent Goblin King, the three hungry trolls who steal the gang's horses and the Gollum, who is admittedly a cutey pie this time around and not the scheming twerp he was in TTT and ROTK. When he and Bilbo play the game of riddles for the ring, he stares up at Bilbo with the eyes of a dog and the excitement of a three year old who just found out he is going to Toys R Us. I felt a little sorry for him when he found out that Bilbo stoled the ring and he went absolutely nuts as if he just lost a fortune on a failed Italian restaurant. Poor little dude. All he wanted was his 'preccccioussss'. I have to give credit to Andy Serkis, for he is able to make the Gollum realistic and lifelike with his spidery and agile movements. The animators also did a brilliant job and were able to capture Serkis' movements and animate overtop of them perfectly. Sometimes, it's as if he isn't even computer generated at all. That's how realistic and incredible the effects are.An Unexpected Journey is far from being a boring film. This funfest has action at every turn and will keep you captivated until the end credits. One minute, the characters are put up against deadly wargs, the next minute, they are in the midst of a deadly rock giant fight. In one scene, they are picked up by giant birds. No fooling! I think some were expecting to see the films of the original trilogy all over again, right down to the gritty war battles with a choir shouting songs in elvish. But remember, this film is entering a different territory than the territory explored beforehand. You just got to except it for what it is and enjoy the fun despite the obvious goofs and mishaps. I certainly enjoyed this film, for it was stuffed with the very things we look forward to seeing in movies, exhilaration and excitement, stuff to get the adrenaline flowing. Hopefully the sequels can carry on in these shoes as we encounter giant spiders, flies and the dreaded dragon, Smaug who sleeps in a bed of gold coins. I wish I could! Take care everybody.",9,1,6,20 May 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," Falls Right in the Middle
","After X2, I was really looking forward to the third installment of the X-Men saga. When the film came out, some were happy with what the third film had to offer, while others were angered to the point of ripping every X-Men comic book in their household. I on the other hand had mixed feelings on X-Men: The Last Stand, overall liking the film, but feeling that it could have been improved in some areas. The new director of the series, Brett Ratner, really tried new things and did something unlike Singer did, but I think Ratner's X-Men 3 falls flat in some spots and really doesn't live up to the previous two installments. It had things I liked and things I disliked, but overall, X-Men: The Last Stand is an average film that would turn a lot of X-fans off the series for quite sometime. Let's talk about the pros. Like the previous two films, X3 really digs in deep with the political matters and mutant protesting. The inclusion of Kelsey Grammar as Hank Mccoy/Beast really makes the mutants more heard in the face of the humans. The humans, as corrupt as they are portrayed in this film, view mutants as sick beings and form a cure to rid them of their mutant abilities. Both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants oppose of the cure, and while the X-Men continue on their quest for mutant acceptance in society, Magneto's Brotherhood plans to overthrow the humans and take out the source of the cure, which in fact is a mutant named Leech. The tension between the good side and the bad side really shines in this film and you can feel the motivation of each character, especially Magneto, who recruits several hundred mutants into his league to stop the humans from trying to make mutants more like them. Another thing I like is that Professor X, despite all the crap he endures in this film, continues preaching his philosophy and optimistic point of view of each situation. Like he did with Captain Jean-Luc, Patrick Stewart really makes Professor X a kindly father like figure to many of the film's main characters. Also pleasant in the film is the overall themes of corruption and deception. The character of Jean Grey/Phoenix is manipulated by Magneto as she finds that she can no longer find her place among the X-Men. The character of Warren Worthington/Angel is forced to endure the cure against his will, for his father is the one who developed the cure from Leech. As he is almost injected with it, he uses his massive feathered wings to fly out a window and he later joins the X-Men. Another theme of the film is choosing fate. The character of Rogue has to decide whether to take the cure or not, for she wants to be able to touch people and not inflict any pain upon them. And kudos to the filmmakers for adding the Days of Future Past simulation in the Danger Room at the film's opening. It was great to see the mutants' powers put to good use and for Wolverine and Colossus to perform the 'Fastball Special', Wolverine beheading a Sentinel in the process. Now let's get to the cons. Too many characters are killed off or pushed aside in this film and many characters are not as developed as they should be. I could go on and on about how Cyclops was killed off about 20 minutes into the film, but it has been said dozens of times already and I'm not even going to bother talking about it now. I will say that people hate this because the promotional images for X3 showed Cyclops in full costume walking alongside the other X-Men as if he was a major part of the film and that James Marsden left X3 to play a meager role in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns. Other characters to get the shaft are Rebecca Romijn's Mystique and even Patrick Stewart's Professor X bites the dust almost an hour into the film. It's not that these characters' demises aren't dramatic, for deaths of major characters can work if done right, but each of these characters fall in such fast paced, anti-climatic ways. It doesn't really add that much tension.The wooden acting that was present in the previous two films is also amplified in the third film. Ben Foster's Angel could have been acted out a little better and his character could have been developed a bit more. Anna Paquin's Rogue was a little flat, but then again, her acting was also flat in the previous films. Even Ellen Page (pre-Juno) as Kitty Pryde could have used a little more depth, although it's good to see Kitty Pryde actually play a major part in an X-Men film rather than just have a brief cameo like in the previous films. So X-Men: The Last Stand falls right in the 'okay' category. It's good for what it is, but not near as good as what X-Men and X2 had to offer. Take it for what it is, or just plain out avoid it.",7,1,2,4 March 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Blows The First Film Out of the Water. This is the Spider-Man I've Been Waiting For
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been a subject of much controversy since it was first announced, which was even before the first film hit theater screens. There have been many of the same arguments given by people, saying that the series didn't need a revamp and that it will never live up to the epic proportion of the Sam Raimi films. But it's all a matter of opinion, and while I deeply loved the first Marc Webb directed reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a superior film, a Spidey flick I've long dreamed to see. Spider-Man is my favorite costumed hero, I know this, everyone who knows me knows this and to me, this is the film that displays the red and blue web head in all his glory. While I still consider Spider-Man 2 one of my all time favorite superhero flicks, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 might very well top it, in many ways than one. I finally got to see my favorite superhero act the way he did in the comics. Seeing the wisecracking, sarcastic side of Spidey brought a smile to my lips and while the Raimi films had a touch of it, this film really showcased Spidey for the silly schmuck he is. He's very reminiscent of Josh Keaton, who voiced Spidey on the Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon. Andrew Garfield has that perfect balance of humor, seriousness and determination, making Peter Parker more than just a vigilante crime fighter. He's very much like a realistic young adult. I also like the suit. While the first film's suit was more stylized and unique among Spidey's wardrobe, this one looks as if it was taken right off the comic book pages, minus the elongated spider logo and shiny black webbing.Electro is my favorite among Spidey's rogues gallery and Jamie Foxx played Max Dillon as not only an electroshocking Mr. Freeze lookalike that likes to shoot lightning from his hands, but a sympathetic and relatable so called 'nobody'. He starts off as an admirer of Spider-Man, but as the film progresses and he gets a dosage of electric eel juice, he comes to despise the wall crawler, feeling that he is stealing his thunder (pun intended). There's also the Rhino, portrayed by Paul Giamatti. He's very different than the character portrayed in the mainstream comics and the various animated series, but Giamatti plays the Russian mobster turned pachyderm like the ham ball he is. Then there is Harry Osborn, portrayed by Dane DeHaan. And let's face it, the cat's out of the bag. If you have seen the trailers, you know he becomes the cackling, glider riding Green Goblin. Yes, DeHaan portrays a maniacal and in many ways grotesque goblin, but the buildup to his goblin transformation is really something to see. Harry Osborn is played out to be the misunderstood son of a rich man, who can be relatable in some scenes and teeth grindingly evil in others. We'll see if he'll don the green glider again in upcoming sequels, or if his daddio, Norman Osborn comes back from the dead to do the job. The chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is probably the film's best element. It was evident in the first installment and it glimmers here. I love the way the two actors work off each other and act like a contemporary couple. You can really tell that Peter and Gwen are madly in love with each other. Now if only Peter didn't make that promise to Gwen's dying father to keep her out of his Spider-Man duties. Now I'm not going to reveal anything, nor deny that a certain main character meets his or her end by the film's conclusion. You'll just have to see the flick for yourself. If your a Spider-Man fan, this might quench your thirst for a good Spider-Man adventure. Sure, some will not go gaga over this sequel or it's predecessor, but for me, it's one of the best superhero flicks I've seen in a while. Better than Man of Steel, better than Spider-Man 3, better than The Wolverine. It's simply fantastic and like the first film, it's a treat. Just go in with an open mind. You'll never know what to expect. I just can't wait to see what Webb and co have in store next. It looks to be the beginning of a much bigger, broader Spider-Man movie universe.",10,13,34,26 April 2014
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Think of It As Rudolph Mixed In With The Works of Edward Gory
","I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.",10,1,1,1 March 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Twinkle, Twinkle Little Bat
","Growing up in the late 90s, early 2000s, there was one director who's work either haunted me or enchanted me. You might have heard of him, his name is Tim Burton. I loved films he worked on like James and the Giant Peach and Pee Wee's Big Adventure, for they captured a wonderful, whimsical and fantastic essence and structure. But when it came to films like The Nightmare Before Christmas and Beetlejuice, I was turned away and terrified, for I just didn't care for the macabre feeling and dark humor. Even the 1989 Batman and Batman Returns didn't suit my taste at first. It wasn't until my later years when I got into the movies and realized how brilliant they really were and how imaginative and demented the mind of Tim Burton was. Sure, some of his films were oddballs like Planet of the Apes and Mars Attacks, but Burton was a mastermind with a signature style and outlook. So when it came time for him to reimagine Lewis Carroll's timeless tale of Wonderland and a little girl named Alice, I was intrigued. I saw pictures of Johnny Depp as the Hater and Helena Bonham Carter's big headed Red Queen and thought this would be an interesting experience with classic Burton humor and memorable characters. And while I'll say right off the bat that the film was interesting, it's not one of Burton's best. It's a brilliant and imaginative dream ride and you were very lucky to see it in stunning 3-D, but at times, I forgot I was even watching a Tim Burton film and instead watching an over bloated, CGI mad fest. The CGI felt a little out of place at times and some of the film's plot points became a little repetitive, like Alice eating the cake to grow and drinking the elixir to shrink. Still, the film has some elements that even rival that of the original animated Disney film and other interpretations done throughout the years. Johnny Depp is a stellar actor and his performance of the Mad Hater comes off as something entirely new and refreshing. He's not a tea obsessed, mad ball like the Ed Wynn version was, he's just a cheerful, optimistic and at times serious fellow that giggles at inconvenient times and gives off a creepy, yet humorous grin. I don't know about you, but every time he smiles, I give a snicker or two. Helena Bonham Carter is also amusing as the Red Queen, a cross between the Red Queen from Through the Looking Glass and the Queen of Hearts. Her quadruple sized head and overbearing voice make her intimidating and fear worthy and in my opinion, it's one of Helena's best performances in her husband's films, right up there with Mrs. Lovett and Emily from Corpse Bride. One of my favorite actors is also in this film. Count Dracula himself, Christopher Lee makes a cameo as the voice of the frightening Jabberwocky and even if he delivers just a few lines, he's a powerful force to be reckoned with. Interesting enough, Michael Gough is also in this film. Of course, he and Christopher Lee worked together in Horror of Dracula and Dr. Terror's House of Horrors. Mia Wasikowska is alright as the lead Alice, but I found myself a bit underwhelmed in some areas of her performance. Anne Hathaway is also decent as the White Queen, despite her constantly waving her hands around like a ninny. The look of the film just screams Wonderland. Burton and his crew were able to capture the stylized and lavished surface of Wonderland beautifully and as I stated before, you were a lucky duck to see this in 3-D. From the inside of the Red Queen's palace to the opaque atmosphere of the White Queen's palace, this film has lots of eye candy to look at marvel upon. The designs of some of the CGI characters is also a highlight. The look of the Chesire Cat really stuck out the most for me and his charisma and quirkiness makes him my favorite character from the movie. He's also voiced by Stephen Fry. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are swell goofballs with ridiculously large heads and a hilarious way of walking about and Absolem is long, blue, slow and outspoken, much like Severus Snape from the Harry Potter films (which makes sense because he's voiced by Alan Rickman). Some of the characters that got under my skin a bit were the Red Queen's associates, you know, those characters with the long noses, huge chins and oversized bellies. I felt they added nothing to the film and a scene where their noses, chins and bellies fall out came off as a bit predictable. Still, many of the character obtain a sense of dignity and determination to do what they feel is right. Alice, in the end, realizes that she was destine to slay the Jabberwocky and in the grand scheme of things, she is able to accomplish just that and save the land. But the film's major highpoint and moral is to believe in your dreams even when you don't want to believe in them. Sometimes, things you think are fake are 100% reality and that you can take control of them, but only if you, you guessed it, believe. Alice in Wonderland gets that point across flawlessly, even if the film itself is far from flawless. Then again, what film is flawless. Alice in Wonderland is a fateful adaptation of the source material and Burton's very best hit at the Carroll tale, but it's in no means his crowning jewel. Aside from a few CGI issues, acting issues, and over the top moments of ridiculousness, it's a pretty decent and fun movie and well worth a few hours of your time.",8,1,2,15 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," From Anakin To Vader
","Oh boy, it's the moment we've all been waiting for. Ever since the prequels got started, the very thing we wanted to see from the get go is how Anakin Skywalker became the man in the black mask with the voice of James Earl Jones. Now, we get the answers we have long craved. With this film, the loose ends are knotted, the circle is complete, and the entire Star Wars saga becomes one solid storybook. Revenge of the Sith is by far my favorite of the newest trilogy, and it's not because it has it's balance of darkness and silliness, it's because it ties so flawlessly into the original trilogy and makes the two trilogies comes together like peanut butter and crackers. Here, we see why Obi-Wan and Yoda go into hiding, why Padme is not in the original films, why Luke and Leia are separated at birth, how the Jedi get wiped out, why Palpatine looks like he has a shellfish allergy, and why Anakin gets sealed away in a shiny black iron lung like a can of green beans. Anakin has a lot of decisions to make throughout the coarse of the film. After defeating Count Dooku once and for all, he is constantly tempted by the scheming Chancellor Palpatine, who secretly wants Anakin to be Dooku's replacement. After being tormented by visions of Padme dying in childbirth and his trust of Jedi Order splitting down the middle, Anakin becomes stressed and gives into his inner demon to become Darth Vader. I think Hayden Christensen has matured greatly since Clones, and even if many say he is still whiny, he is whiny for a reason. I mean, come on, you would be whiny and desperate too if you were having visions of a loved one in pain. I also think Hayden's take on Anakin parallels that of a tragic figure in literature, someone like Achilles or Macbeth or maybe Anakin's inspiration to begin with, movie star James Dean. The supporting characters are also top notch in their respective roles. Ewan Macgregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi gets more Alec Guinness like ever minute of the film. Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine is chilling and hideous, very much like demon from the Underworld. And Natalie Portman (pre Black Swan Oscar winner) delivers an over the top, yet tear jerking performance as the tragic Padme, who unfortunately meets her demise at the end of the picture. What makes Padme so tragic is that Anakin turned to the dark side to save her, and out of his own anger and impulsive actions, choked her, causing her broken heart to break even further which makes her loose the will to live. By the end of the film, Anakin, who has been deep fried on the planet Mustafar and put in a suit of armor, realizes that on his own intentions to save Padme have ultimately backfired, and on his quest to save her from death, he caused her death, and that, in my book at least, is reminiscent of a great Greek tragedy. Now, Anakin, who has long since been dubbed Darth Vader, has nothing left. The Jedi have been wiped out by the newly born stormtroopers. His wife was killed at his own hand as he desperately tried to save her. Now, his only purpose is to serve as Palpatine's lumbering henchman, a henchman who would be force choking many Jedi for the next two decades before A New Hope. It's a sad fate for a sad character like Anakin Skywalker, who would spend the next 26 years or more living in a life support suit and fighting for redemption. Revenge of the Sith really is the darkest out of the series, even a bit darker than the grand Empire Strikes Back. From the moment Anakin beheads Count Dooku to the moment Order 66 is initiated to the moment Anakin bursts into flames and becomes a human spare rib, it's surely some intense material for a Star Wars flick. No wonder it got a PG-13 rating when it was first released. And to think that in 7 years, Disney will have distribution rights to Revenge of the Sith. A little too extreme for the mouse house if you ask me! I also must say that Sith has the best lightsaber duels out of any other film in the saga. I love when Anakin and Obi-Wan take on Dooku, I love when Obi-Wan takes on droid General Grievous, I love the final fight between Vader and Obi-Wan, but I think my favorite has got to be the duel between Mace Windu and Palpatine. I personally think it's Samuel L. Jackson's crowning moment out of the prequels. All this and more is the reason why I think Revenge of the Sith is the real trophy out of the prequels. Sure, it has it's groaning moments, like the scene where Anakin and Padme are expressing their love for one another, but this one has got it where it shines. A lot of people who disliked Phantom and Clones really digged this one as well, and in their eyes, it made the entire prequel trilogy worth wild. Tune in next time, and we'll have a look at the original films.",10,0,3,13 March 2013
The Lion King," Perhaps The First Movie I Ever Laid Eyes on
","Growing up in the mid 90s, my mind is pretty vague when it comes to the first movie I ever saw. I could say The Wizard of Oz or The Nightmare Before Christmas, but then I remember The Lion King, a movie I saw when I was very, very, very young and I immediately consider it the first film I ever laid eyes on, although I'm still uncertain whether that's the case. I will say that The Lion King was my first venture into the world Walt Disney started and still to this day, almost 19 years after the film's release, it's still as mesmerizing now as it was then. It's my favorite Disney film (although Mary Poppins comes pretty darn close), and as I watched it throughout the years, I was not only astonished by the film's unforgettable plot and characters, but by it's morals, outlooks and philosophical meanings. There's more to The Lion King then I originally thought, and as I grew older, I came to realize what the film was really about. The first thing I must point out is that this is one of the defining movies of my childhood. I had all the Lion King figurines as a toddler and even put my hands on a Super Nintendo controller while The Lion King video game was in the system. But that's not the main reason why I love this film to pieces. The animation in this flick is some of Disney's finest and really demonstrates the capabilities of the CAPS (Computer Animation Production System). The film also demonstrates techniques that are almost as old as Disney films themselves. While making the film, the Disney animators observed real African wildlife, much like how Disney and his crew observed real deer and woodland creatures while making Bambi in the 1940s. And you can really see this in the creatures in The Lion King, for they have such a lifelike quality and display realistic movements. It's almost like you are watching real life animals rather than animated ones. It's really something spectacular. Another thing I love about this film is the surroundings. All the African scenery and environments are beautiful to observe and witness and they really fit the tone of their respective scenes. For example, the elephant graveyard really fits the scene involving Scar and the hyenas. The canyon with the stampede really fits the scene where Mufasa meets his doom and Simba runs away. The jungle with all it's waterfalls and slimy critters really fit the scenes with Simba, Timon and Pumbaa. It all ties together nicely and really makes the film feel more wholesome. It's as beautiful as a newly painted landscape. The voice acting in the film is some of Disney's best and some of the veterans from this film would go onto voice characters in other Disney films. James Earl Jones is triumphant as the voice of Mufasa and is his best voice work in my opinion (next to Darth Vader of course). I just love the might he brings to Mufasa, making him into the most dignified and most serious character out of the entire film. Jeremy Irons is also magnificent as the voice of the villainous Scar, really making the character into a sadistic, slimy, yet satisfying adversary who really turns the hyenas into dim witted stormtroopers. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are the perfect pair when it comes to voicing the film's main comic relief, Timon and Pumbaa and come off as clumsy, yet potent creatures who just want to make their way into the world and eventually, they do when they help Simba and his crew take out the hyenas. But my all time favorite voice acting in this film comes from David Guillaume, who voices the wise, yet rambunctious Rafiki, a feisty baboon/mandrill hybrid. I just love how Guillaume plays Rafiki as a prominent mentor to Simba, prominent, yet still playful and exotic. One minute he can be bouncing off the trees, the next minute he can be meditating. He's like a cross between Yoda and Tim Curry's It. I just love how Guillaume portrays Rafiki as a down to Earth, yet off the wall teacher and not just another clichéd 'no nonsense' mentor.The music in this film is in my eyes, the best Disney music ever. Now everyone has their favorites and really, it's all a matter of opinion, but if I was to be asked what Disney movie has the best music, I would come right out and say The Lion King. I must admit though, I'm not the biggest fan of Elton John, but the music he wrote for this film along with Tim Rice really fits the overall tone for a film about a lion on the verge of becoming a powerful king of all lions. You got the opening theme which sets the mood (Circle of Life), the song about the main character's point of view (I Just Can't Wait To Be King), the over the top villain song (Be Prepared), the comic relief's number about not giving a hoot (Hakuna Matata), and the inspirational love song (Can You Feel The Love Tonight). It all falls into place nicely, and with Han Zimmer's excellent score echoing along with the songs, you can't go wrong. It's something he would pull off again when doing the score for a certain trilogy of films about a guy who dresses up as a bat. The Lion King is an all around perfect film and the film which spawned my everlasting love for anything with Walt Disney's name attached to it. It's a film which digs into the heart and soul and we can relate to it's creatures, even if we are human and they are obviously not. It's a film for everybody, helping them to realize that they too have their place in the Circle of Life.",10,0,0,1 March 2013
X-Men: First Class," Gets Better and Better Every time I See It
","In the early 1960s, mutant kind is elusive in the eyes of the humans. A mutant tyrant, Sebastian Shaw, plans a nuclear attack on America that will kill the humans and make the mutants the most dominant species on the planet. To stop Shaw, young Charles Xavier and Eric Lenscherr form a team of gifted youngsters, youngsters with incredible abilities and powers. Overtime, they learn to harness and control their powers, and they prove most vital in the final showdown with Shaw and his evil Hellfire Club. But all does not turn out well in the end, as Charles is paralyzed and he and Eric part different ways, Charles officially forming the X-Men while Eric becomes Magneto and forms the Brotherhood of Mutants. That's basically the premise of X-Men: First Class, the astonishing prequel to the X-Men film series and the best and the boldest X-Men film in my eyes. Sure, it has had it's share of controversy when it was first revealed, but overtime, the public basically forgot all about the controversy and just enjoyed the movie for what it was. And what it was was a well written, well acted, well paced action piece that really fit the time it takes place in. Watching this movie, I forgot it was made in the late 2000s and thought it was made in the 60s. It has that incredible luring that sucks you in and really makes you feel like you are in the 1960s atmosphere. Everything fits incredibly well. From the footage of JFK, to Green Onions by Booker T and the MGs, to pinball machines, it really takes you back in time before James McAvoy became Patrick Stewart and Michael Fassbender became Ian McKellen. Speaking of which, both actors steal the show head on. Both McAvoy and Fassbender as young Charles Xavier and Eric Lenscherr respectively really share a very brotherly relationship and you really feel sorry for both of them when they split up and become what they become. I really love how Eric is the most rebellious of the two and that Charles is basically the one in the background saying 'Eric, control yourself', but that only makes their relationship even more interesting. You can't help but feel pity for Eric though, for the nefarious Shaw, played by Kevin Bacon, savagely murdered his mother right in front of him when he was a child. You can really feel his thirst for Shaw's demise, and it makes it even more powerful when he eventually does defeat Shaw, although Eric believes in Shaw's motivations that mutants are superior to humans. I also loved Jennifer Lawrence as young Mystique. She's so sassy, slinky, and at times seductive, you can't help but drool over her. That Beast is one lucky guy! I also think Nicholas Hoult was a perfect choice for young Hank Mccoy aka Beast, although, I have to admit, his blue, furry Beast makeup looks a little silly and out of place at times. Luckily, he still retains the geeky, nerdy, 'sciency' personality he's known for, and he kicks a lot of butt when fighting the teleporting Azazel. Even though this film lacks the original five Kirby X-Men (with the exception of Beast), it still has some pretty iconic and well developed X-Men to fill in the void. There's Banshee, the wailing mutant that will blow your ears off, there's Havok, the plasma blasting mutant that shoots cosmic hula hoops, there's Darwin, the adaptable mutant who can survive in any environment, and a very brief appearance by a certain claw slashing mutant that shall remain nameless.One of the highlights of this film is the action. I think First Class has the best action out of any other X-Men flick, even better than the Statue of Liberty fight in the very first X-Men film. Once again, you get sucked into the reality, and you really feel like you are right there watching Beast, Havok, and Banshee beat the snot out of Azazel and Angel Salvadore. I also really enjoyed the final confrontation between Eric and Sebastian Shaw. Bacon portrays Shaw as such a maniacal villain, you just want to see him get his butt kicked, but his final fight with Eric was played out in a very straight forward, yet very effective manner. The music played during this scene and many of the film's action scenes is phenomenal. Kudos to Henry Jackman for making the score fit in with many of the film's emotionally charged scenes. In the end, the only real thing I can complain about is that the film leaves you wanting more. It leaves you wanting to see how exactly this universe will progress, and how it will further tie in with the X-Men films that preceded it. I know an X-Men: Days of Future Past movie is in the works that has Stewart and McKellen returning as McAvoy and Fassbender's older counterparts, but for now, I will settle with this remarkable masterpiece that has driven my love of X-Men even further. I can't wait to see what happens down the line and to see how this new installment relates to the installments that helped make X-Men the pop culture sensation it is today. Remember, the point between rage and serenity.",10,0,1,12 February 2013
The Wolverine," Kinda....meh
","I liked X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Yeh, sure it's despised by a lot of the X-Men movie fan community and the comic book purists, but I quite enjoyed it the first time I saw it and while recent viewings of it didn't leave the same impact, it's still a movie I wouldn't mind watching every couple of eons. Of course, it's only my perspective, so I have to be quite honest when expressing my thoughts on a motion picture or picture show. That being said, the semi-sequel to X-Men Origins, simply titled The Wolverine is, well, kind of mediocre in my eyes. I didn't really have all that high of expectations for this film and it wasn't atop my MUST SEE list of 2013. But, after seeing the film twice now, I think the film is okay, but not a personal favorite. I was never a big fan of the storyline where Wolverine travels to Japan, fights Silver Samarai and all that jazz to begin with, so I didn't really know what they were doing with this one, not what to expect.There were good action scenes and great character development for our main player, once again played by Hugh Jackman, but part of me was constantly saying 'I've seen this stuff a million times'. A million and one wouldn't have hurt, but I really wanted to see something unique, something fresh and innovative, something that was never done in an X-Men movie before. Of course Wolverine gets his claws covered in blood for the first time on film and the whole plot about Yashida taking his healing powers was very interesting, but most of the time, it felt like Wolverine just going around, stabbing people with his claws and smooching with the ladies. A million times. Sure, it's cool to see Wolverine being haunted by the ghost of Jean Grey, who he had to skewer in The Last Stand and the main female character, Yukio is beautiful, but at some parts, I wanted to drift off to slumberville. Some parts, I wanted to walk away and make my own assumptions on how the movie would end. The movie just didn't seem all that appealing to me. Now remember, it's just my opinion and if you like this movie, that's perfectly fine. Everyone has a different taste. But I really wouldn't want to watch this one that often. It was bland at some parts, mediocre in others and my overall verdict of the film is.....mehI liked some of the effects and the whole Japan environment is nice to look at, but I really don't have that much to say about this one. I really couldn't give a fist full of adamantium claws. It's just okay.Hopefully, X-Men: Days of Future Past will be a zillion times better.",6,0,0,26 April 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," An Umbrella Wielding Nanny Goes Up Against A Mouse
","This is a story of a curmudgeon Australian born author bound to keep her story of a magical nanny out of the hands of Hollywood. It's also the story of a man named Walt who was determined to keep a promise to his daughters to turn the curmudgeon author's story into a movie. As Walt tries to persuade the author to hand over the rights to her books, the author keeps telling him that the story of Mary Poppins is not meant to be turned into a motion picture, for it is a story of her life, a story of her childhood and a story about her beloved father, the inspiration for George Banks in her tale. That's exactly why this film is called Saving Mr. Banks. It's not just about P.L. Travers trying to save her stories from the gloved hands of Mickey Mouse, it's about letting go of the past, learning from it and using it to become the person that you are. This film makes you think of Mary Poppins in an entirely different light. I always liked that the meaning of the 1964 film was about Poppins helping Mr. Banks realize that he didn't need a nanny after all and that he should be the one to guide his children in the right direction, but to see the development, the struggles, the conflicts and the overall madness that occurred to get Mary Poppins made just makes you think to yourself.......We are so lucky that this film exists.We can see why Travers didn't want her story mauled by the mouse house but at the same time, we can see why Walt Disney wants to turn Travers' beloved tale into a movie. There's no good guy or bad guy, it's just two entirely opposite individuals at entirely opposite ends of the fence. And I just love how Travers and Disney go at each other's throats, I mean they really play off of each other and you can really feel the tension between the two as they try to get their own ways. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were spectacular choices to play both Travers and Disney respectively and I think they'd be perfect contenders to receive Oscars.There's also Dick and Bob Sherman, the songwriting team behind the 1964 classic as well as Paul Giamatti as Ms. Travers' car driver. The relationship between Thompson and Giamatti's characters is another highlight of the film and very heartwarming at times. Colin Farrell is also grand as Travers' father, an alcoholic banker who stills has a heart of gold. I also liked the woman who played the Travers' nanny, the obvious inspiration for Mary Poppins in Pamela's books. You can also expect to hear a lot of songs from the beloved Disney film such as Feed The Birds and Let's Go Fly A Kite. And I have to admit that at the very end of this film, I got a bit choked up. Not that the ending was necessarily sad and depressing, but because it was bittersweet and changes the very way you look at things. From this day forward, I won't look at Mary Poppins the same way again. Seeing the making of one of my all time favorites has altered my entire view and I can honestly say that I like the film a heck of a lot more now than I did when I was 6 years old. Saving Mr. Banks is a great film to close out 2013 and a great way to celebrate Mary Poppins' 80th anniversary. It has a tad for everybody, plenty of laughs, cries, and a timeless story about a timeless story. It's simply.....Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.I don't know if I spelled that right.",9,1,3,3 January 2014
X2: X-Men United," Singer Knows How To Tackle X-Men
","A few weeks ago, I reviewed the very first X-Men film as well as First Class. Now, I figure it's only fitting to review the remaining films of the series as well as the Wolverine spin off. One thing I can say right off the bat is that Bryan Singer knows how to tackle X-Men, and his sequel to the 2000 film that boosted the superhero film genre really shows his taste and understanding of mutants. X2, also called X2: X-Men United is one of those many sequels that parallels that of the first and in many ways is superior to it's predecessor. I lot of the things I wanted to see in the first film and didn't see, I saw in this film and the action and special effects in this film were far more contemporary than the often cartoony and dated effects of the first film. X2 really pushed the X-Men franchise to the edge and really brought something to the dinner table that had never been seen beforehand. Until First Class came along in 2011 to steal the trophy, this was my favorite X-flick, but even if it's no longer my favorite, it's still a fantastic film and ranks high on my favorite superhero film list. Kudos to Singer for making the 'X-sequel' reminiscent of the beloved 90s cartoon series, yet still adding a realistic and recognizable environment into the mix. Like the 90s series, this film brought in a lot of serious and over the top scenarios and dealt with a lot of the same elements present in the first X-Men film, such as mutant protesting and disarray, governmental corruption, and the X-Men trying to maintain peace while the Brotherhood wants to start a war. It also deals with the topic of assassination and mind controlling, for the villainous William Stryker, played by Bryan Cox, uses a serum to manipulate certain characters like Nightcrawler and Magneto and makes them either reveal top secret information or launch a full scale attack. It took X-Men films to a whole new height and it makes the film not only a good action thriller but a brilliant political thriller as well. The acting is pretty good for what it is, but like in the first film, it can be a bit wooden and bland at times. I have to praise Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen for their takes on Professor X and Magneto respectively, but the real player in this show is Bryan Cox as the scheming and conniving William Stryker, a mad scientist/string puller who really has you grinding your teeth in angst. Hugh Jackman is also top notch as Wolverine, and to see elements of his past was among some of the best highlights of the film, something that would be seen firsthand and expanded upon when X-Men Origins: Wolverine rolled around. I also must bow down to Alan Cumming for his excellent portrayal of Nightcrawler, the teleporting smurf....I mean mutant who really makes the comic book character come to life. It's too bad that they couldn't expand upon his relationship with Mystique, for in the comics and many of the animated series, Mystique was his mother and Rogue was his stepsister. But since they didn't make Professor X and Juggernaut stepbrothers in X-Men: The Last Stand, it's no biggy. But the best element of this film is the action. This film has the best action out of any other X- Men film, even better than the action in First Class. Although First Class had the best character development and best story, this film has the best action and the best nail biting sequences that send the suspense meter through the roof. I love the fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike. I love the fight between Wolverine and Stryker's henchmen at the Xavier Mansion. I love the opening scene where Nightcrawler takes on the President's security guards. I love them all, for they compliment the story and add that perfect blend of alacrity, dilemma, and expanse to the film's overall scope. Another thing I must point out is that the heroes and the villains, despite their perspectives, join forces and work together for once. That's something that isn't seen too often. X2 is something special to me, for like the first film, it made my love of X-Men rise to sky highness. I was really looking forward to the next chapter in this constantly unfolding saga, but X-Men: The Last Stand......okay, well talk about that one next.",9,0,1,4 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Fairy Tale Set In Space
","May the fourth be with you everybody! Today, on Star Wars day, I figure it only fitting to review the film that started the whole starry craze, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress! Nah, just kidding, it's Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope of course. It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz. But what makes Star Wars great is something I can't sum up in one single review, but I'll certainly give it a try for your sake. This is 1977's Star Wars, the film that changed cinema forever. I can relate to this film on so many levels. I see a lot of myself in the characters of Luke Skywalker, C-3P0 and even the cocky Han Solo, a rebellious lad with a devil may care point of view. I can also look up to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has become a lot like his master Qui-Gon Jinn by this episode. He has gone from a brash, outspoken padawan who viewed many creatures as useless to a wise old man who saw the potential in all creatures. I love Obi-Wan's wisdom and it's wisdom I live by every minute of everyday of my life. My favorite line of his is 'Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?' He has such a rich perspective of everything and his knowledge of the Force can give you the push you need to go about even the deadliest of tasks. It's his guidance that finally allows Luke to demolish the Death Star at the film's finale and it's probably something that will carry onto mentor Luke in the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7. Obi-Wan is the kind mentor we all wish we could get knowledge from so we could become wiser souls. Darth Vader is a menacing entity and is up there with the Wicked Witch of the West as one of film's greatest foes. The emotionless mask and deep dark voice of James Earl Jones really makes him ever more terrifying than he already is, but if you saw what he once was in Episodes 1,2 and 3, you tend to fear him less and less. It's hard to believe that underneath that breathing helmet is the charred face of Hayden Christensen, a once proud hero with a charming charisma. Little did we know that it would take him two more films until he finally reached his redemption and even than, it was before his untimely demise. Darth Vader is a motion picture icon, not only because of his wickedness and evilness, but because of his tragic past and his fight to gain back what he lost all those years ago. That's what makes an incredible villain, a villain that never wanted to be bad, but was thrust into badness because of one fatal decision.The other characters are also worthy of mention. Mark Hamill prevails as the adventurous, yet good hearted Luke Skywalker who would become the galaxy's most acclaimed hero towards the film's conclusion. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is a lot like Dorothy Gale or Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic Wonderland stories. Sure, she gets captured, but she's perfectly capable of defending herself and even defending her companions. She's a fearless woman who is not even afraid of kissing her long lost brother straight on the lips. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the film's most memorable human character and with his headstrong and hipster attitude, he was what a lot of children wanted to be like when they first saw Star Wars back in 77. He's the ideal punk, but he's also the gallant hero and tough guy who's not scared to shoot down some green aliens (Who cares who shot first!) or stormtroopers. Personally, I became more fascinated with the non human characters like Chewbacca (Why didn't he get a medal!), R2-D2 and C-3P0, for like the humans, they were always trying to get the spotlight and give their share to the story. I feel like C-3PO is the most underrated character in all of Star Wars, for he is often seen as a symbol of homosexuality and annoyance. But Star Wars has a timeless story first and for most and this story gets better and better every time you experience it. Every time you experience it, you spot things you never spotted beforehand and that adds to the film's overall charm and magic. Even though it was made in the 70s, it still has the touch of a story that will last forever and never wear out. With all it's grand special effects (no matter what version of the film it is) and alien lifeforms, Star Wars is a storybook with a grand scale and a powerful, prudent moral that all creatures have a force flowing through them, allowing them to reach out and achieve the impossible.I'm not quite sure but I think that's why we love it so much. That's the reason I love it at least.",10,5,7,3 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Greatest Sequel To Grace The Screen
","It has been echoed an infinite amount of times before. It has been chanted from the highest hilltops and the most well known critic sites on the internet. It has been said time and time again. Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars movie, but the best movie sequel ever made, and a prime example of how follow ups can match up and even prevail over their predecessors. While I like the prequels and the film that started it all in 77, The Empire Strikes Back has always been the SW film that glowed the most for me and had the best scenes out of the entire saga. It also introduced my all time favorite Star Wars character and my favorite movie character in general, brought to life by a man who based the character's look and facial expressions off his own. The Empire Strikes Back is the ideal Star Wars film for me, and although it received a mixed reception when it was first released, it has garnished a monstrosity of a following these last couple decades and it shines as one of the greatest sci-fi thrillers with loads of twists and turns to quench your thirst. From the opening battle on the snowy world of Hoth to the final confrontation between Luke and his soon to be revealed father, Darth Vader, this film has a scale, a scope, a powerful, eminent feeling to it. John Williams' exuberant score plays through like an orchestra at an opera and each scene carries suspense and magnitude as you see the events the main characters must live through. As a sequel, it also digs much deeper into the characters' souls and puts them up against powerhouses we never thought they'd go up against, not even in the first movie. Luke Skywalker must train to become a jedi on the swamp planet of Dagobah and at the same time, he must learn what makes the ways of a jedi work. He must be patient and believe in the unbelievable, which is something he fails to do at first (That is why you fail!). He also must learn to avoid the temptations of the dark side and learn what the force is all about. The force is not always about lifting things and tricking people's minds, it's a much bigger entity than Luke could ever imagine, and it's something that touches every life form. In a peanut shell, the force is with everything and allows all creatures to coexist and be bound together as one solid package. This is one of the many lessons Yoda teaches Luke in the second act of the movie.Luke's friends, Han and Leia are also met with extreme challenges in this sci-fi sequel. As they are constantly on the run from the relentless Empire, they must learn ways of hiding and working together for the benefit of surviving the Empire's vicious clawing. Han and Leia must also balance their romantic feelings for one another and learn to get along as well as not let their inner devils get the best of them. But in the realm of seriousness, there is also a bit of comedy and endless excitement. I love Han's relationship with C-3P0 (Never tell me the odds!) and that the Millennium Falcon is always malfunctioning and breaking down. It can't even make the jump to light speed, which it did so frivolously in the first outing. The chase through the asteroid field remains one of my all time favorite scenes out of the saga and John Williams' score for the scene amplifies it's awesomeness. Now let's talk about Yoda, my favorite Star Wars character and movie character of all time. Designed by Stuart Freeborn, Yoda drew inspiration from Albert Einstein, Buddha and even Kermit the Frog, but overall came off as a wise little creature with a brain as big as the galaxy itself. He undeniably has the best dialogue out of the movie and at times, it's hard to believe that Yoda was a puppet and not some real life alien from another world. Luke takes his teachings seriously, but when Vader uses Luke's fears to his advantage (by torturing Han and Leia), he flees in a state of franticness and his inexperience is the main reason why he fails against Vader in the Cloud City 'windy room'. When Darth Vader revealed himself to be Luke's father, many jaws dropped, many undies were pooped, and many gasps were heard throughout the theaters back in 1980. Today, the climatic twist is still as legendary as it was then and it has been lampooned bazillions of times on television shows, parodies and other movies. What makes the scene great is the build up. It's something we weren't expecting and when it came, it smacked us hard in the faces. Of course, there is so much more to talk about, like the Fett man, the awesome Harryhausen style stop motion of the AT-ATS and the tauntauns, the brilliant, exotic looks of the environments and the overall quality of the film, but I've rambled on long enough. The Empire Strikes Back is a mesmerizing experience that still holds up some 33 years later. If you had to watch one Star Wars movie and didn't know which one to watch, why not give this one a viewing. I don't even think you need to see the first film to enjoy this masterpiece, for it's energy and richness makes it stick out like pink hair. It's truly an experience that will leave lifelong lasting memories, so if you need a getaway, take a trip to that galaxy far, far away and let George Lucas' imagination do the talking.",10,0,0,15 June 2013
The Wizard of Oz," The Greatest Fantasy One Could Embark On
","In 1900, Lyman Frank Baum wrote a story about a little girl named Dorothy who was hurled away from dusty Kansas to the magnificent land of Oz, filled with talking Scarecrows, wicked witches, big headed wizards and magical shoes. This story was so successful upon it's release that several film adaptations have been made throughout the years, but it wasn't until 1939 when the world first saw the film that is probably the most well known and admired film of forever more. The Wizard of Oz is the pinnacle motion picture of many of our childhoods, for we saw it at a very young age and it augmented our lives and points of view. Some consider it their favorite film, others consider it a icon feast, I however see it as the greatest fantasy one could embark on. This is one of the greatest tales ever told (both the movie and the original book) and every time I set my eyes upon it, I realize more and more how much I love this film and just how legendary it really is. The Wizard of Oz is THAT film, the film everyone has seen more than once and it's imagery and surroundings are very hard to rid from the mind. It's characters are relatable and very vivid to look at (Would you believe Bert Lahr's Lion costume was 90 pounds!) and the songs the characters chant are songs everyone can sing, for everyone has heard them so many times and know the lyrics by heart. But where The Wizard of Oz truly shines is in it's moral, that there is no place like home. Stated only once in Baum's original story, this quote has been the most prominent and well known movie quote ever spewed from a human mouth and it goes to show that no matter who you are and where you are, you always have a place to go to and people you can love and cherish. It's not about what kind of home it is, it's the fact that it's a home and it's a place where you can be who you want to be and relate with those most dear to you. It's the love and the warmth of being together that really matters and it's what Dorothy realizes at the very end of the film, that no matter how sepia toned her homelike is, she can be happy there and always love the things around her. That is one of the many reasons why this film is truly perfect in every sense of the word. Nah, it's not perfect, nothing is perfect, but this film is pretty darn spectacular and it's a film that will live on many, many, many, many, many years down the road, even after I am gone off the face of the Earth. This film is a tradition that generation to generation can savor and take to the heart and it's a film no one can deny, no one can get fed up with. It's the very film that gets you out of sadness and despair and into the realm of grandiose and fantastic nature. It's the film that gives us brains, gives us courage, gives us heart, gives us strength. That's all I have to say about that.",10,3,4,3 May 2013
