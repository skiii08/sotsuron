The Avengers," How this movie is anything less than a 9 is beyond me
","This was by far one of the best Marvel movies made to date. The action, acting and comedy laced in were on point through out the whole film. The best part has to be when Hulk did his smashing of Loki and called him a puny God. That stuff was super funny and entertaining. I can't wait until the next Avengers and what it brings. All the characters were super entertaining and I'm glad they were able to bring in A list actors to do the job. Do NOT go cheap on the 2nd one please! Thanos at the end was a great teaser so definitely looking forward to that. I didn't mind Mark being the Hulk this time and he would be good to play the next movie as well. It would be nice to see some guy play the Hulk more than once and he does look the closest to the old Bruce Banners from the original TV series.",9,3,7,27 October 2012
