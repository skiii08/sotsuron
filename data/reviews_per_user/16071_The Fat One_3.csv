Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just What You Expect
","I was determined to view this movie with few expectations and judge it on it's own merits (no small feat, since most would agree 'The Phantom Menace' is the most hyped, most anticipated film in motion picture history), and for the most part I think I succeeded.  Having said that, I must also relate that my 10-year-old son, who watched it with me, was not immune to the hype and clearly had high expectations as we went into the theatre.'The Phantom Menace' does not try to disguise what it is:  a prologue to both the new trilogy it begins and to the classic Star Wars trilogy it chronologically precedes.  Fortunately, this does not mean it is all introducing the characters (some new, some familiar when they were younger) and explaining the galactic politics and The Force mythology that drives the story.  The pod race sequence, the battledroid confrontation, and the climactic lightsabre duel are some of the most impressive special effect/action scenes ever put on film, and the story seldom bogs down before picking up the pace again.I enjoyed 'The Phantom Menace,' and I know I will see it at least once more while it's still in theatres (which is sure to be a long, long time). It is not my 'new' favorite Star Wars movie (that is still 'The Empire Strikes Back'), but the pod race just might overtake the Battle of Hoth as my favorite sequence.As to the performances, some are better than others.  None detract from the movie (even the computer animated Jar Jar Binks).  But only Ewan McGregor truly stands out.  I would also hope the sequel will afford Samuel L. Jackson with more than a cameo role.As for my 10-year-old's perspective, he told me 'The Phantom Menace' was 'good,' but it was obvious he came away expecting more.  More from this movie, or more from George Lucas (i.e., the next Star Wars installment)?All I can say is he wants to see it again...in a theatre!",Null,1,1,19 May 1999
Chicken Run," Beautiful--Simply Beautiful!
","This is a visually beautiful animated (clay stop motion) film.  The detail the artists used in both the characters and the miniature sets is unbelievable.  It is impossible to imagine the number of skilled man-hours that went into it's making.But, more than being visually stunning, the story speaks to children with humorous eloquence, while simultaneously hooking adults with it's sophistication.  I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this film.",9,0,0,28 June 2000
Resident Evil," Well--it's better than Super Mario Bros....
","My son is really, really, really into this video game, and as you might expect, he enjoyed it a lot more than I did.  However, I'm not going to rag on this Video Game-to-Movie.  To tell the truth, I found myself enjoying it for what it is:  A good, scary zombie flick with the kind of special effects we take for granted anymore and lots of action.",7,0,0,15 March 2002
