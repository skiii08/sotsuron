Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not As Bad As Everyone Says... BUT Not That Good Either.
","The Phantom Menace is a perfect example what NOT to do when bringing back a beloved franchise, that earned MILLIONS of fans through its quality. But is it as bad as everyone says? No. Not at all. Because, some things are done very well here. Like the final battle between Qui Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul and also the Pod Racing scene. But of course, the main thing done wrong was Jar Jar Binks, and he's the main reason why this movie is the worst Star Wars ever made. Why? Because he's the most unnecessary character to be added, and is also one of the most annoying. You could see Lucas was clearly trying to add some more comedic elements into the movie, but the humour here is bland. It's not funny. At all.It also goes without saying, nobody cares about Anakin when he was a kid. Nobody. This was another unnecessary thing added to the movie. These movies were meant to be about his path to the dark side, not his life as a child. Nobody wanted this.However, the good things in this movie were certainly the battle sequences. They were great. And the locations were very Star Wars-y too. They had a great feel to them. And also the Pod Racing, as mentioned before, was very fun to watch. I just wish there were more Pod Races in this movie, and battle sequences especially. But it feels so drawn out. Which is why the movie is rated as low as it is.5/10 - ONLY JUST average.",4,0,4,20 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," That Bitter Taste...
","This movie: I can sum it up with one word... Bitter. Not because it was bad, or boring, or just plain old terrible but because I had extremely mixed thoughts about it and cannot quite decide whether or not it was good or bad.The action was brilliant as it always is in these types of movies; Wolverine is just a badass in the film, but at the same time, I felt like this movie could have been something more... A lot more. The story was boring as hell for starters. The characters and the way they portrayed them seemed to feel dry -- the love story was extremely boring -- not to mention the amount of build up to typical action scenes. Just wasn't worth it.Some action scenes did feel exciting to watch, and the effects were not bad for 2009. Out of all the X-Men movies I've seen, this one probably has the best action in it and is probably the most enjoyable. The story and the mediocre-clich√© love story ruined it. Same with the rubbish and forgettable characters.6/10.",6,0,0,19 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," We Should Have All Seen This Coming...
","The moment Disney bought the rights to Star Wars, the movies were booked a one way flight to disasterland.Disney's lack of understanding and care for the lore and the fans is ever so paramount here. The lack of logic; suspense and care put into this trilogy is insulting. The amount of jabs they take at the original trilogy with little nuances hidden in the so-called 'story'; their way of telling you that you're dumb for thinking the originals are masterpieces.While we all sit here; angry and pissed off at this insult of a movie, they're sitting back, relaxing and wiping away their tears of laughter with their billions and billions of dollars. And it's all our fault. We gave them money. They don't care if it's good or not; they know Star Wars sells.The plot structure is absolutely garbage, just like the story and character development. The characters all have god mode enabled and are never really in any true danger; there's no suspense or any reason to care for their well being as the trials before them are overcome with ease.The twists are laughable; the comedy some of the worst I've ever seen in a Star Wars movie. It's like Marvel humour, but without the 20+ movies behind it to actually make the jokes make sense.We finally find out who Rey's parents are and, while this is the only twist that was slightly unexpected, it was still utter garbage and lazily done. The movie, again, just like the two before it relies way too much on nostalgia, making the current roster of characters feel more pointless than they already are.The only plus points to this movie are the visuals and the soundtrack (John Williams saved this movie from being a 1). But I don't go into these movies just to go like 'Oooh, look ma'. Pretty things! Ooh!'. No, I expect a damn Star Wars movie! Not whatever this crapshoot was!",3,9,13,13 January 2020
The Matrix Revolutions," This one slowly drifted away from the whole 'Matrix' thing and headed more to a direction of...The Terminator?
","Worst of the trilogy. In fact I wouldn't call this a Matrix movie, but it was decent. The action was great and over the top, the story was strong. But where's the slow motion, bullet dodging like in the previous two? It isn't there!! The only slow motion parts are in the final battle, which captures the face reacting to the punches. It was a great conclusion yes, but it isn't The Matrix. This movie should have been called 'The War of the Machines'. The first one is and always will be the best one of the trilogy. I found that this one lacked the class the first two had, not to mention this one was rushed. We waited ONLY six months for this to be released.The action like I said was good, the effects were good for its time and the script was well written, the acting is superb and the final battle was a great way to end it. Sadly this didn't live up to expectations and it could have been so much more!6/10",6,0,0,14 May 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Good, but still the weakest of the franchise
","Now I have watched this movie so many times and I have grew up with harry potter like most of you here have and I was disappointed with this movie. It was a good movie but also bad at the same time. Let me explainThe good: The movie still has it's humor which is great. It has the old Ron that was scared of everything. The enemies were a great addition to the franchise. Great acting that always impresses me when I watch these movies. Making Sirius Black act like a true criminal towards his first scenes.The bad: The movie gets boring. It drags on. Poor action sequences. And those annoying stalking moments with the map, too many of them moments.Overall I give it a 7/10 It is a good movie, but it needs work. The ones before and after it are much better than this one but that's my opinion. This movie remains the weakest of the entire franchise",7,0,1,21 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Disappointed with a wannabe Spider-Man, but yet still fun to watch.
","Now we all know Tobey Maguire is a better spider man, but Andrew Garfield was good yet, he was disappointing. I wasn't exactly as disappointed as I thought, since I knew he wasn't going to be as good as good ol' Maguire. All though the story of the film isn't completely fresh, it's still a better story than I had hoped. I didn't like 'Gwen' where is MJ? But I should stop ranting about all the bad parts.Anyways, the film itself was fun to watch and the humor made me laugh a couple of times. The villain wasn't shown in the previous trilogy and it was really nice to see Doctor Connors turn into the lizard. The CGI in this film is just like every other movie, you can tell it's fake but it did really capture the action well!Compared with the trilogy, I'd say this movie is the WORST Spider Man movie of all time, but it ain't terrible...7/10",2,0,1,8 May 2013
Saw III," Brutal, yet satisfying
","SAW I Is still the best. But SAW III corrected what SAW II did wrong. More of the billy puppet was seen in this sequel and it showed us what happened to the characters at the end of SAW I and II after the credits.The gore has never been more brutal, I admit I found myself looking away at some points but that was the fun part! And that is how a SAW movie is meant to be like!But what happened to Laurence Gordon? Unless I missed something in the previous SAW movies. The last I saw of him was when he went to get help at the end of SAW I and he never came back for Adam.All though this movie was amazing, we still had some unanswered questions at the end of this one.9/10",9,0,2,28 April 2013
Frozen," Frozen; Pixar's Overrated Disaster-piece.
","Don't get me wrong. The animation in this film, like in most Disney Pixar films is fantastic. But animation does not in any way, shape, or form make a good movie. Sure it's good eye-candy and pretty to look at, but it's honestly a lazy way to grab people's attention.Frozen is a movie that pretends to be something it is not; a good movie.Let's start off with the songs. Songs in Disney films normally have purpose in the film. They relate to the movie, and include lyrics that relate to a later or earlier event in the movie. However in Frozen, this is not the case. Let's use 'Let it Go' for an example. The overrated and stupid song known as 'Let it Go' seems pretty deep, and sad, right? You'd think maybe this song would have more behind it. Nope! The meaning of the song is later diminished, as if the song never happened in the first place.'Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?' is a song that is placed there for no reason. Other Pixar films would have done that scene, without the song. Maybe added a little comedy element. Such as the character doing acrobats, and trying to make as much noise as possible. It'd be so much better than a little girl singing to a door, and doing dangerous stunts while she's at it.And the story? Don't get me started. Elsa (the boring protagonist) has NO background. No explanation to how or why she has the powers she has. She is shown as the villain for most of the movie, but then there's a special twist at the end which says 'NOPE. F**K YOU. WE'RE DOING IT OUR WAY!' If you're going to have a plot take a twist, at least do it right. At least hint stuff. At least have some real build up, instead of throwing it out there for the hell-of-it.Olaf is annoying. What more can I say? He's a snowman who loves to joke when there's something EXTREMELY serious happening. Oh yeah, but he's Olaf, so it's okay.The other characters in this movie? Like the real villain (Hans, I think); pointless, forgettable and worthless! Same as that dude who is supposed to like Anna. He's even more forgettable, I've forgotten his name! When that happens, you've got a terrible movie! Their 'love' has no build up. Some trolls sing to them both, saying how they should love one another because, y'know, it's Disney! What sorta' Disney film is complete without pointless romantic relationships?Frozen fans will turn to me and say 'It's a kids film, it needs no depth'. That's their excuses to stop you from criticising this film fairly. A film is a film, kids film or not, we deserve to say what we don't like about it.This has got to be the most overrated film in history.",1,11,24,29 October 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disappointingly Average
","I originally went to the midnight showing of this back in December. Only reviewing it now because, for whatever reason, I was unable to make a review for any title for the longest time.I've not watched it since, so forgive me if any information I say is... inaccurate.But this movie. Where to I begin? Well, I suppose I say it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Because it's not. There's something to enjoy here but, some sequences, make it incredibly hard to enjoy it the way it should be.I'll say the cons first, because they are the most glaring.I'll start off by saying the Canto Bight sequence was 100% pointless. It was unnecessary and slow. There was no substance in any of the scenes that showed Canto Bight. It felt like they were trying too hard to spread the 'animal cruelty is very much real' message. I get it that they want to spread awareness, but don't make it glaringly obvious. Actually have it play an important role in the movie, rather than having it there for the sake of it.Rose is an awful character, in my opinion. She is just there for diversity sake and nothing but. The actress, which I'll give credit, did a great job with what she was given but I felt like she was shoehorned into this movie. Rey's training feels far too rushed. Before anyone says that Luke's Jedi training in Empire was rushed, I'll correct you by saying his training took up a good portion of the movie and even by the end he wasn't a full Jedi. He was a full Jedi in The Return of the Jedi. Awakens ended with Rey finding Luke; her training barely happened and all of a sudden she's able to use the force to move rocks out of the way as if she had been training for a long, long time.Speaking of Rey, the whole 'strong female role' feels forced. Again. I'm all for female roles being strong, I am. But don't make the male's almost irrelevant. Finn didn't really do that much in The Last Jedi. Yeah, he had a few scenes here and there, but he practically spent the entire film with Rose. Doing, let's be honest, very little.Rose saves Finn. Okay, but if Finn is to be killed off in the next film, they've missed a great opportunity. It was a typical 'here comes Disney' moment, ruining what would have been a great scene. Not saying I wanted Finn to die, but if they have plans to kill him off in the next one, I'd suggest they don't because they missed out on what could have been a great death scene.Humour? Too much of it, but there are also pros around that too. So I won't say too much. And Ben Swolo. Why? Oh, and Phasma again falsely built up.Oh, and last but not least. Luke. This film completely goes against what his character is about. He's meant to be this confident Jedi who always tries to find a way. In The Last Jedi? He's the opposite. He's pessimistic. He's not wanting to save anyone or anything. It's not Luke. And the promise about his screen time? Yeah, false. You probably know that though because you're reading a spoiler review.Now onto the pros. There aren't many, but the stuff they get right, they do get right, hence my rating.The effects, in my opinion, are great. They're not overly reliant on CGI. It's good to see that a majority of the aliens in the movie are puppets, but really detailed and realistic ones. It's good to know they've not used CGI for the sake of it like how it was with the prequels.The acting is fantastic, in my opinion, for the most part. Yes, Rey's still a bit... whiny. But she's not as whiny as she was. She's much better than she was in Awakens. The action sequences are very well shot and very well choreographed, with all the angles and such. I feel they did extremely well in that department. Really, really well. I enjoyed the sequences.The humour, albeit overused, was funny in some places. So I could enjoy it in that respect.Overall? It's not as bad as people say, but don't go out of your way to watch it. If you're a die hard Star Wars fan (like me) then. Go ahead, I guess. But don't go in with high expectations. Keep your expectations neutral and just go in with the 'sequel mentality'. Rule of thumb is: movie sequels don't tend to always be as good as their predecessors. (Unless your movie is Empire)6/10",6,4,6,5 July 2018
Saw II," Saw 1 still remains the best of the franchise, but this is close behind.
","Saw I will always remain the best from the franchise, but Saw II follows closely behind. I will explain the good parts and some of the flaws it has.The good: The story is still strong and links closely with the first film. The acting is superb once again and the emotion is captured perfectly. Amanda returns which was an amazing feature! The traps, once again sinister and terrifying. An intense movie once again.The bad: The iconic Billy Puppet, wasn't in it much which disappointed me a little. Some of the characters were just...Annoying, like that girl who couldn't stop screaming her head off.Overall? It's a great movie, just falls short of a must see but it's worth a watch. 8/10",8,0,1,27 April 2013
Taken," Liam Neeson at his best
","This film was amazing, Liam Neeson is as hard as nails!He kicked butt better than Jason Statham and Bruce Willis combined!! The story is pretty straight forward, his daughter gets kidnapped and he has to go and save her. Yeah, pretty easy to understand. But the action within it, is epic, brutal and badass!!This movie is definitely one of the best action-thrillers out there and I doubt it can be beaten by some of the greatest directors of all time!!Taken is one of those films that you'll love to watch, it is amazing.10/10",10,3,4,26 July 2013
Saw," Intense, gory and amazing...but it's not scary.
","Saw is an amazing film to watch. Now the definition of 'scary' doesn't fit this film. More like 'intense' would be the word to use for a film like this. But if you're not a fan of this genre, at least consider giving it a try. It is really good, and I was thoroughly impressed from how they actually made this film. I mean the story of two guys, locked up in a room from this mysterious killer. The atmosphere of it all is one of the strongest points, it has that slight eerie feel to it, that you won't find in most of these types of movies.This is a must watch and also a golden movie for the entire genre.10/10",10,0,1,26 April 2013
Joker," A Deep, Dark and Twisted Masterpiece - No Film in 2019 Comes Remotely Close
","I will start off by saying this review will be spoiler free, as well as a minor disclaimer for those thinking about seeing Todd Phillip's Joker.If you are expecting your typical, over-done, run of the mill comic book movie. You won't find that here. This is not a film filled with jokes that either work or don't work; this isn't a movie where the heroes always win. This is a movie centered around a troubled man and his descent into madness.It is dark and, at times, horrifying. And it is an outstanding masterpiece because of that. Had this movie been toned down, it would not have been nearly as great as it is.Joker is centered around a failed, mentally-troubled comedian called Arthur Fleck. He is constantly looked down upon by society, beaten and bullied. And, as you may have guessed, this causes him to slowly lose his mind and become the Joker. That's not a spoiler, by the way. If you think that's a spoiler, look at the name and synopsis of the movie.It's filled with shocking, gruesome scenes. Tense encounters. A realistic depiction of how it is to lose sanity. And it is absolutely terrifying. A once innocent man trying to chase his dream like so many of us is beaten and bullied, or often ignored by society when it matters, becomes ones of the most notorious criminals in all of comic book history.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance that rivals that of Heath Ledger. And at times? It trumps Heath Ledger's Joker. It is crazy and sadistic and, at times, honestly haunting. Terrifying, even. The writing is absolutely incredible in this movie and complements Joaquin's acting abilities. I don't think there could have been anyone better to star in this movie than him.Acting his fantastic across the board. But this review would be incredibly long if I wrote as much about them as I have Phoenix. But everyone, from top to bottom, contributed to this masterpiece extremely well.If you've not seen it already, go see it! Just do not expect this to be like anything else you have seen. It's dark, twisted and haunting. It's not a happy-go-lucky, joke filled superhero flick.10/10",10,8,13,7 November 2019
Inception," Entertainingly complex
","Inception is one of those movies...that really plays with your mind, that forces you to think. Not to think to hard, but it does make you think.it is a unique film, there is no other movie like it. I have never seen a film so beautiful, so breathtaking, so complex, that it made me think. Guys and girls, this isn't just your average action movie. This is a masterpiece, a one of a kind! Christopher Nolan never fails to impress, he always finds a way to amaze his audience and if you are not impressed by what he does...I'm afraid you don't know what an amazing movie is. Inception follows the story of Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio) who was convicted of killing his wife, he gathers a team to help clear his name and how he tries to clear his name is by performing Inception, by going into other people's dreams and infiltrating the subconscious of their targets. When he arrives in Los Angeles, he gets reunited with his children and tests if its reality with the spinning top, he goes to play with his children and the Spinning top seems to still spin. So we don't know if it's reality or in his dream and THAT's how the movie causes you to think, is it reality or a dream?Inception is a definite 10/10",10,0,2,14 May 2013
Toy Story 3," A fantastic ending to one of the best family movie trilogies in the history of film.
","Toy Story 3, one of my favourite Disney Pixar films of ALL TIME. I think most recent Disney films are barely up to expectations. Along with Finding Nemo, Up and the past Toy Story films, this is one of the better Pixar films released. It is a smart, unique idea that has never crossed the minds of other animators in history.Toy Story 3 perfects Pixar animations like never before, every minuet of it is a fantastic! This was definitely 2010's best movie without a doubt, it is a movie that ALL audiences will enjoy, no matter the age, this movie will make you laugh, cry and even makes you leave with a smile.Toy Story 1 and 2 were movies of my childhood, and Toy Story 3 gave the franchise the very send off it deserves.",8,0,3,2 July 2013
Fantastic Mr. Fox," 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is... well, fantastic!
","Back in 2009 when this movie was first in cinemas, I turned a blind eye to this film. I didn't really watch many kids movies then. I was an all- action person. I loved action films, and still do, mind you. But over recent years (last two years?), I've found myself getting more in touch with my younger side; the side that loves animated films.I'm going to try and keep my review spoiler free, but I will mark it for having spoilers just in case something slips out. The premise follows the same as the book; Mr. Fox steals food from three wealthy and dangerous farmers, and in an attempt to kill him, they dig up his home, forcing him and his family to dig deeper and deeper underground. That's a rough outline of the storyline. There's more, I can assure you, but I'm only filling in the necessary plot details. Right off the bat, the stop-motion animation is smooth and effectively used. The characters, despite it being stop-motion, move smoothly. Acrobats and quick movement are actually quite entertaining to watch and you don't have to wait long to see some good use of stop-motion.The cinematography in this movie is used very well, making some awesome scenes. You could have one thing happening on one end, and another thing on the other end, all in one scene. And it's not just subtle. You can clearly see two things are happening at once. When they're digging away from the farmers, it gives you a side view to show you what's happening above and below. This is used really, really well!The humour in this movie can get a few chuckles out of you, even if you're the type who only laugh at adult comedies and not family comedies (note: I said family and not children's). The characters we can certainly relate to. We all know an Ash. We all know a Mr. Fox. We know that one kid who picks on anyone for being different. This makes the emotional aspect of this movie carry that extra punch.Speaking of the emotional side of things; despite it being more comedic, the film does have a lot of touching moments. These moments make this movie even more forgettable than it already is. Am I glad I watched this in the end? You're cussing right I am! Great movie for not just children, but for any movie-lover really.",10,2,4,19 October 2014
Looper," 'Face your future, fight your past' - this film is amazing!
","I was not expecting any of this, this was a totally different movie than I was expecting. But that's a good thing, Looper has amazing Special Effects, amazing story, amazing acting and also makes you think.This movie is about Joe, a Looper who kills people sentenced to death through time travel. Of course during this, he notices his future self (Bruce Willis) come through, yet he doesn't know this. This film is about hunting him and killing him, as Old Joe is trying to kill the Rainmaker to save his wife from the men who killed her.It's a very deep story, with amazing action scenes. I didn't know it was Joseph Gordon-Levitt until I saw the poster, and that shows the make-up department did a damn good job on his face.Looper is a nice action film, with J.J Abrams style effects with a fantastic side story in it.10/10",6,2,6,26 August 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Only 3 stars? You got to be kidding me
","Now...after revenge of the fallen i felt a little, uneven with this movie but when i watched it I loved it, I was gripping my seat with the GREAT CGI effects, and intense action. The story telling in this movie was better than ROTF. Now don't get me wrong I enjoyed revenge of the fallen but it was the worst of all the movies, this was a HUGE improvement. I especially loved the battle at the end. I don't understand the hate for this franchise and if this story is over then the next movie should be a prequel.If you don't agree with me on the note that this movie rocks...then yeah take your hate somewhere else, because Michael bay did a damn good job on this movie.",6,4,8,29 December 2012
