Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Everything I wanted in a new Star Wars movie and a bag of chips
","First of all, how much fun is this movie?  Amazing!  So intense, so visually exciting, so encompassing!  So ends my 16 year wait. I need to say that before I saw the film, I read the reviews which almost unanimously slammed the movie.  Actually, all the reviews looked like they'd been done by the same critic, but that's another matter.  The critics are not wrong.  They just weren't really watching the movie.  They pretended to look for deep meaning in vain, yet missed all of the subtle satire and double meanings hidden within the movie. To be honest, I wasn't looking for the greatest movie of all time.  I just wanted to see a new Star Wars movie.  And Phantom Menace delivered.  And this episode works so well in conjunction with the other films.  If you know the story for episodes 4-6, Phantom Menace takes on a whole different tone. You know who Palpatine is.  You know who Darth Sidious is.  And you know who Anakin is. That's it - Just go see it - whether or not you've seen the others. This movie can and will stand on its own.  In 20 years, the next generation may have grown up watching episode 1 first and Return of the Jedi 6th.  One word of advice - don't operate a car within a half hour of seing this film!",9,0,0,19 May 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Overrated
","I just saw this movie for the first time for a class, and I have to say I was disappointed.  I've been told that some of this stems from my having read Arthur C. Clarke's book, which has nothing to do with the film. But I enjoyed the book and had trouble sitting through this movie.  I can certainly see why it was considered a 'drug movie' in the 70's.  It has a lot of the same elements of the music of the period - long, drawn out, surreal sections of time full of discordant images (or sounds).  It is most likely art and as such, appreciated or hated by its viewers.  But as a movie, I thought it stunk.  As a storyteller, it stunk. I'm sure people will try to explain the film's cosmic beauty or underlying amazingness on a level I will never understand, or tell me that it's precisely because it bored me to tears and was mostly incoherent and repetitive that makes it great.  Maybe I shouldn't have read the book first. But I can not imagine ever wanting to see this movie again.",3,9,17,6 May 1999
The Waterboy," Funniest feel-good movie I have ever seen
","This movie had me gasping for breath the same way 'Something About Mary', 'Birdcage', and 'The Mask' did, but Waterboy was more than just a comedy.  I saw avowed Adam Sandler haters cheering with the rest of the crowd at the end of the movie as our hero prevails.  This is a must see movie for anybody who enjoys football, laughing, or movies.",10,0,2,16 November 1998
