Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Analysis of Kill Bill Vol.2
","The more I see this movie the more I like it. Tonight I really got into the camera work. Way too many over the shoulder camera shots. It made me wish Tarantino included an Ozu film or 2 in this homage orgy. (Which, lets face it, is what Kill Bill is). There is this one shot in the wedding rehearsal scene that showed the back of Rufus's head, the Bride, Plimpton and a couple of her friends all in deep focus. It really reminded me of the opening shot of the suicide attempt in Citizen Kane where it shows the the bottle, the glass with the spoon in it, Susan and Charles Foster Kane bursting in the room all on a 70 to 80 degree angle. Gregg Toland is crying for joy somewhere. I really like this movie mainly because I like westerns. I appreciate shots like the one that showed the Bride walking from the grave to Budd's trailer. I like the long takes. The opening scene with the Bride driving was great film noir (another genre I like). I think people were disappointed with this one because they wanted another 'Kill Bill Vol. 1'; all blood, guts and quick editing. Another thing I like is the dialogue. The writing in here is more classical prose as opposed to the hard-boiled stuff used in 'Resevoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction.' I especially like the monologues on the Black Mamba snake, the story of Pei Mei and the Superman myth. Many people want the dialogue to be similar to Pulp Fiction. Please. People seem to forget that Bill, Elle Driver and the Bride are millionaire assassins, not low-rent criminals like Vincent Vega or Mr. Pink. Millionaire assassins do not talk like those kinds of people. You can imagine discussing 'La Dolce Vita' or Noh theatre with Bill or Elle or even O-Ren. And if you lived to tell the tale, well then that would be something.",Null,0,1,25 September 2004
