Minority Report," Action/thriller with Signature Highlights from Spielberg to Cruise
","Minority Report is the latest film from Stephen Spielberg that stars Tom Cruise as a cop from the year 2054, who works in the pre-crime division of the Washington D.C police department. The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.Based on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration. (Sounds like a visit to amazon.com?) Spielberg lightens up the tone with his signature wit and humorous quips and visuals now and then, as opposed to Ridley Scott's more serious and consistently dark visualization portrayed in Blade Runner.As a plotline, Minority Report is intelligent, has a good consistent flow, isn't always predictable (at least not that long before it happens), has many twists and turns with legitimate dead-ends, and above all, tells a plausible story (even if the basic premise itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief). As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program, he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the `pre-cognitives' who predicted his crime. To tell any more of the story would disclose too much; besides, it isn't necessary. You know all you need to know here.The best parts of the movie are so good  from the high-tech special effects to the light-hearted humorous moments to the good, steady flow of the action and plotline  that the problems with the film are easily forgiven. That said, my main gripe is the presumption that, in the future, anyone convicted of a crime before it happens is immediately sent to a state of suspended animation, an alternative form of the death penalty. This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.Still, in the end, these didn't bother me that much. I still had a great time, and enjoyed it as the frivolous and wonderfully playful action/thriller it was intended to be.",Null,6,6,21 June 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun for the whole family, whether you've been on the ride or not.
","Ahoy Maties! Grab your swords and board the dreaded pirate ship, the Black Pearl, and sail back in time to when you were a kid at Disneyland, going through the boat ride, `Pirates of the Caribbean.' Whatever your imagination could have conjured up, it couldn't possibly compare to the wonderment, fun and childhood excitement that the live-action film delivers today. This is, in many ways, the perfect film, because it not only does exactly what it intends, but it does so without a hint of corniness, overdone computer graphics, sappy dialog, or boring plot line.Sure, the movie is just for fun, and you can enjoy it for what it is if you go into the theater with the same sense of fun that you'd have going into the ride at Disney parks. In fact, just about every scene from the robotic namesake ride (that's over 30 years old) is featured conspicuously in the film, causing giggles of nostalgia from the audience.The plot is classic fairy tale formula for a Swashbucklin' Pirate story that involves pirates, fair maidens, a hero to save her, royalty, and an intricate intertwining of relationships that make things oh so juicy. Here, Johnny Depp leads the pack as Jack Sparrow, a lone pirate on the Caribbean Sea, looking for his lost ship, the Black Pearl. It'd been commandeered years earlier by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who'd lead a mutiny against him. For Sparrow to get his ship back, he must commandeer one of his own, so he picks one from the Royal British Navy. But first, he must cross swords with a young sword maker, Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom.In the meantime, Barbossa has his own agenda: to break a curse set upon the crew after they stole ancient Aztec gold artifacts. To do this, they must return the gold, plus spill the blood from a descendant of the original captain of the Black Pearl that pirated the loot in the first place. Through misidentification, they capture Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley, who is subsequently kidnapped. In this scene, Geoffrey Rush delivers a brilliant monologue about his plight as a cursed pirate.At this point, Turner and Sparrow set out as partners to find the Black Pearl: Turner wants to save the girl, and Sparrow wants to get his ship back. Over the course of the film, as secrets are revealed and events unfold, the tension and action builds to a rewarding and pleasingly climactic ending.Essentially, the movie has it all: cartoony sword-fighting, skeletons drinking rum, dream-like scenery that captures the spirit of the dark, imaginary world of pirates swinging between ships, ladies having to walk the plank, and valiant heroes saving them. With the youthful target audience in mind, a more cynical viewer looking for a more intense or less `comedic' tone might be disappointed; similarly, an overly protective parent might be concerned for their youngsters' fear factor at some special effects, but these are all phantom concerns. `Pirates of the Caribbean' as a great mid-summer hit that's sure to please the whole family.",Null,0,0,30 July 2003
Seabiscuit," Yes, this beautiful docu-epic drama is good... but not THAT good.
","Seabiscuit, the true story of a knobby-kneed racehorse and three men down on their luck, is the latest Docu-Epic from Hollywood, beautifully filmed in California, with its signature late-afternoon golden light, close-up intimate shots of emotional facial expressions, and the freedom-like feeling anyone gets when watching a horse run freely in a pasture. It's the telling of an American dream: a depression-era drama about down-trodden misfits and an unlikely animal hero who overcome the odds. Yes, this two-hour and twenty minute cinematic masterpiece is sure to grab the public by their little heartstrings, and send them tearfully home with hankies and sniffles, proud to be a member of that great expanse of land between the oceans known as. America.Ahem. Ok, the more sober description goes this way: Laura Hillenbrand's wonderfully-crafted book about the race-horse, Seabiscuit, is going to be this year's mid-summer blockbuster.It's not a terrible movie by the home stretch of the imagination, but like my early characterization, `Seabiscuit' is a huge glorification of a documentary intended only to show the best side of an otherwise ratty bunch of well-meaning characters. Jeff Bridges leads the pack as Charles Howard, the flamboyant bicycle repairman-turned-millionaire, who purchases Seabiscuit at the behest of his recently hired trainer, Tom Smith, played by Chris Cooper. Smith, a sort of horse whisperer who was known for his quiet nature and his ability to get along with horses better than people, meets Red Pollard, the infamous jockey, played by Tobey McGuire, who reportedly lost 25 pounds to fill the part. Seabiscuit and the three men, all down and out underdogs with their independent and wretched pasts, all helped revive each other through Seabiscuit, and give the American people a reason to hope during the Great Depression.The movie is another retelling of a timeless theme that always wins with audiences: good-guy losers beating the odds. When you mix a sure-fire premise with gorgeous cinematography, you can't lose. And this movie won't lose either. But that doesn't mean the movie is as good as the reviews  or the box office  will claim it is. The main problem with the film is that it tries to serve two masters. That is, it's both a documentary and a dramatic Hollywood big-screen Epic. The movie's `documentary' aspect leaves a lot of things out, and ends on a great, wonderful, victorious event, despite the real story ending quite differently. Consequently, the film's `drama' suffers, because it leaves out the deeper and more disturbing character flaws and relationships that truly fleshed out the characters. The film does manage to stir emotions about a profoundly difficult era with historian-narrated commentary and photos, but the context doesn't translate well to how the characters think or behave. In short, the movie's parts are all great, but they don't tie together well-enough to deserve the praise the movie is receiving.All in all, Seabiscuit is a really good-looking film, with great lighting, epic-like proportions, terrific acting,, but there is nothing really interesting about the film except for the story itself, which is better told by Hillenbrand's book.",Null,0,0,30 July 2003
Black Hawk Down," Great visuals, but remains too neutral in message
","In the opening scene of Black Hawk Down, the plain white text on black background says calmly that the movie is based on actual events. This is an understatement. In the midst of reality-based entertainment, this film pushes the envelope the furthest so far, totally immersing you in a war environment like no other experience before. Director Ridley Scott re-creates a fierce 15-hour battle between besieged U.S. troops and Somali fighters on the streets of Mogadishu in 1993, in which 18 Americans were killed and 73 injured, along with thousands of Somali militia. Scott's exceptional visual sense is expressed to perfection, putting you directly in the center of action, from beginning to end, as if you were one of the soldiers themselves. But, don't think it's just another testosterone-laden war film. It's not. It is an intelligent and ambitious effort to accurately portray the soldiers' experiences of that fateful day.                                    The plot is actually rather simple. American servicemen were to capture the warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid, in a mission that was to take less than one hour. Things went awry from the beginning when a soldier falls to the ground from a helicopter. The dominoes start to fall as his comrades attempt to rescue him, and they start getting picked off by snipers. The movie is all about what these soldiers went through, and how they survived, or how they died.                                    And herein lies the dilemma. The cost of portraying reality so intensely and dramatically in two hours means that anything that could soften this experience has to be left out. In this case, any sort of character development, plot, or historical context that may suggest political commentary one way or the other have all been swept aside. Also note that the film portrays experiences, not necessarily everything that happens. The political objectives of their mission are, as you might expect from a soldier's point of view, all besides the point. What's more, certain events, like the dragging of two American soldiers through the streets - an event that was televised on CNN that moved American public opinion so strongly - are also left out of the film. It isn't entirely clear what the Scott's intent was for the film, since what I saw seems to differ from what he said he wanted to do in interviews I've read with him. Regardless of intent, I thought the film was a fabulously intensive visual experience, and I felt I got a true sense of what things are like in a modern combat situation.                                    Discussion of the problems with the film get complex and difficult, since it's not entirely clear what story or message the film wanted to tell. From a filmmaker's perspective, this is a risky approach, and in so doing, has already alienated many people who feel that the film leaves out too much context, or that the film should take a position on whether we were doing the right thing by being there. Then again, when you're in battle, it's easy to forget, let alone think about, the political or humanitarian reasons for your presence, and the movie makes that abundantly clear.                                    But, taking the position of 'neutrality through non-statements on either side of the issue' is not as ambitious as 'neutrality through explicit expression of both sides of the issue', as was done so skillfully in the film, Dead Man Walking. In that context, I felt Black Hawk Down paled dramatically to its potential. Even less excusable is that the skills of these mature and well-seasoned filmmakers could have taken those bold steps.
                                   While the film's realism is violent and bloody, it is not exploitive. Rather, it is tastefully done such that anyone-as uncomfortable as they may be seeing such things-can have a better appreciation for what real battle is all about. It is also timely, as the very same powder keg in Somalia is once again back in the news as this film is being released. In fact, the same warlords are still in power. What we do about it now, as opposed to 1993, will be interesting to witness. One of the effects of September 11 is that America had a rude awakening to the realities of a harsher world with terrorists and anarchistic warlords. Seeing and understanding Black Hawk Down is a sad, but necessary next step in our maturation process for world events. It's only too bad that it didn't really take the bolder and more difficult step in broaching the difficult and complex political and social issues.",Null,0,0,19 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Good, but nothing new from Ron Howard
","Ron Howard's latest film, A Beautiful Mind, is also a beautiful movie. In fact, it's so beautiful, that it seems planned and packaged just for the Oscars, and just in time for Christmas. The film stars last year's Oscar-winning actor, Russell Crowe, as the real-life John Forbes Nash, the mathematical genius who, while a graduate at Princeton University in the 1940s, discovered a principle equation that changed economic theory. But his prodigious career was sidetracked by his struggle with schizophrenia, almost destroying his family and himself. The irony of his predicament was that the drugs that kept his psychosis in check also prevented him from thinking coherently. In order for him to think, he couldn't take his medication, which lead to perpetual delusions. He eventually learned to use his own mind's logic to keep his thoughts in check, even though he still suffered from schizophrenia The movie portrays this struggle, and shows how he learned to live with his illness, while going on to win the Nobel Prize and continuing to teach mathematics at Princeton University.
Howard's treatment of the characters, plot and atmosphere are all done with his usual gifted talent for direction. But here, he employs an interesting story-telling twist: the first half of the film is viewed from Nash's perspective alone, so we're just as confused, surprised and shocked as he is when his psychosis manifests itself, blurring the line between reality and paranoia. Then, the perspective changes to an objective viewpoint, compelling us to feel sympathy as an outside observer. Crowe's portrayal of Nash's gradual deterioration into schizophrenia is believable, and as he devolves both mentally and physically, we are lead through his emotional and psychological struggle. It's Crowe's performance and Howard maturity as a director that will make this film an Oscar contender.
Yet, despite its wonderfulness, the film also has its problems. Yes, it's a sweet, good-looking film, but you almost feel pulled into the same old Hollywood formula that worked in the 80s and 90s. We're not seeing anything we haven't seen before, especially from Howard. It also seems to be a fad to make dramas about a genius who is forced to deal with psychological problems, while keeping the audience somewhat unsure about what's real and what's not. This trend started with Good Will Hunting and The Sixth Sense and continues directly into this week's Vanilla Sky. In all these strength of the films are the struggles between the two extremes of the protagonist's mind. Not that A Beautiful Mind is another Good Will Hunting or Finding Forester, but their common element is that they pique our fascination and curiosity about a brilliant mind being in a confused state, using the same psycho-dilemma technique.The ace-in-the-hole with A Beautiful Mind, however, is that it's based on reality, which has a disproportionately stronger emotional effect than it might otherwise have. By contrast, movies like Good Will Hunting have to be several notches better at character development and personal triumph to have the equivalent emotional impact as their reality-based counterparts. As a strict comparison of movies, the characters in Hunting were far deeper, and the drama more compelling than in A Beautiful Mind, but one can't tell an audience that. True, Nash's actual life may have more interesting because of his being real, but it's the director's job to make us feel it without the reality check as a crutch. Remember, the film was inspired by events in Nash's life, and is also based in part on the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, so more of this movie really is more fiction than real. With this much artistic license, we shouldn't be so willing to excuse oversimplified and over-dramatized accounts of events, but we do anyway. That was Howard's trump card.That said, just because the movie wasn't as strong as it could have been doesn't mean I didn't like it. I did - in fact, I think the film is excellent, and well worth attending with family or friends this holiday season. It's a feel-good film that we deserve at this time, and there's nothing wrong with that.",Null,0,1,23 December 2001
Vanilla Sky," Surreally entertaining, but ultimately fails in its own objectives
","An adaptation of Alejandro Amenábar's narcissist's nightmare 'Abre los Ojos', it's like a cross between The Matrix, Total Recall, and Fatal Attraction, only this production takes the worst-common-denominator of the three. That they were good films with creative ideas and vivid characters is what keeps Vanilla Sky above water, but won't likely be appreciated by a more sophisticated audience.While the ending does bring together all the unlinked and confusing elements, Vanilla Sky wants to be much more than a simple action-thriller. A love triangle, a deeper and more meaningful introspection on the 'self' and its various psychological components, a philosophical bent... A lot could be done with this mixture of science fiction and psychological drama, but the movie ultimately fails to accomplish its own goals. If it's going to be about an ego-centric publishing heir who turns a new leaf, give us more of a basis for his motivations. Sophia's character wasn't strong enough for us to believe that she, alone, compelled him, especially since they knew each other only a day when his tragedy befell him. While Cameron Diaz did an excellent job at a femme fatale, her relationship to David was too unimportant to him to make the 'love triangle' germane to the plot. It was hard to feel empathy for him. (Fear, yes, but that's two-dimensional; not the depth that the film could and should have achieved.)To its credit, the film does succeed in providing a beautifully filmed series of scenes, with good-looking people and a climax that does pull together the loose ends and give the audience a sense of completion. To a less-discerning, younger-generation of movie-goers, this may be worth the price of admission. However, for me, the movie failed to meet its own potential, eroding my opinion of it to a tepid yawner.",Null,0,0,13 December 2001
Bruce Almighty," God, I loved this movie. :-)
","There's nothing like a good comedy flick to lead in the summer, and Jim Carrey's, `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' is the best of its breed. It's formula, to be sure, and all been done before, but `Bruce' is funnier, wittier, smarter, and  odd as this might sound  more sophisticated than its predecessors. It's as though Carrey and his filmmaking partners refined the comedy/romance formula to a science, because this film does exactly what it intended to do: entertain.Like previous Carrey films, `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' follows the familiar plot line where a down-on-his-luck guy gets a magical ability, fools with it for a while for fun and laughs, and after he goofs up and learns his big life lesson, walks away with the girl in the end. In fact, most Carrey comedies follow this story, most with director, Tom Shadyac at the helm. This time, Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter who always gets the humorous lifestyle stories, but never the big news stories that will give him a future as an anchorman. True, he's great at his job, has a great girlfriend, and seems to enjoy life to the fullest. But, Bruce wants more out of life. His ambitions exceed his abilities, so bad things keep happening to him. When he finally breaks down in a bout of self-pity, he blames God for all his failures. God, in response, has a meeting with Bruce, and decides to give him all the powers that He, himself, possesses. With that, Bruce goes on a wild ride of performing magical acts and other deeds of self-indulgence to `right the wrongs' that he feels were done to him. Through a series of hilarious and well-crafted gags, complete with special effects, Bruce eventually makes the big mistake that makes him realize that being God isn't all that easy, and that he was perfectly happy with his life as it was.There is no question that any film that broaches the subject of God will noodle the zealots one extreme, or disgruntle the intellectual community on the other, unless it delivers poignant messages, or makes philosophically acute observations about the meaning of life. `Bruce' doesn't even attempt to address these tougher subjects; but it carefully inserts a couple one-line commentaries that make us unambiguously aware that yes, the filmmakers are avoiding the subject, and they know we're watching for it. This is done so well, in fact, that it's part of what makes the movie so appealing to a wide audience.As for Carrey himself, It's true that Jim's a unique actor, and he's shown capabilities far beyond the notorious over-the-top physical comedy he's best known for. But, his funny side is still where his genius lies, and he has traditionally fostered a relationship with a rather narrow audience because of his style. So, those who are not Jim Carrey fans might find it hard to bring themselves to see `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' But, I think they'd be surprised; his humor is less reckless, arbitrary, and irrelevant to the storyline. Instead, `Bruce' is funny largely because he remains within the framework and context of the story, supporting characters, and the persona he endows in his own character.To that end, all the supporting actors are perfectly cast as well. Morgan Freeman depicts `God' exactly as I'd like to see Him, and Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's girlfriend makes her relationship with him all the more believable. I should also mention Steven Carell's role as a news anchor is tearfully hilarious in his own right. He came from Comedy Central's `The Daily Show', where he also played a TV reporter for a ½-hour show that spoofs the news nightly.In the end, `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' succeeds in doing exactly what it intended to do, and works at every level. Even the use of a few four-letter words didn't seem inappropriate (it's rated PG-13). I'd say it's perfect for the whole family, and a refreshing way to start the summer.",Null,1,2,30 July 2003
Signs," Dissenting Opinion: Shyamalan sacrifices characters for 'surprise endings'
","M. Knight Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense', and his latest film, 'Signs', have both done very well at the box office, not to mention gaining some critical acclaim.  He brings a wonderful sense of mood to the screen, portrays human emotion effectively, uses dialog well, and his slow, determined pacing takes the audience through wonderful psychological distresses. He also presents interesting and compelling supernatural ideas for a premise to get us to wonder and imagine other-worldly situations. Mixed in with that, his surprise endings successfully leave the audience feeling duped, but happy.  We were into looking one way, while the magician skillfully removes our wristwatch without our noticing. What a clever skill, right?Well, the problem is that his technique for getting us to look the other direction is, frankly, done on the cheap. To illustrate the point, understand that supernatural/sci-fi films require at least two storytelling elements: 'suspension of disbelief' and 'staying within the circle of plausible possibilities.' That is, 'suspension of disbelief' is where an impossible premise is used as the framework for a story. For example, we can believe in aliens, or that a child can see dead people, because we can imagine a fantasy world where that may take place in our mind's eye. Because we know it's not a true story, which we would 'disbelieve', we instead 'suspend' that disbelief in order to keep the fantasy going. And, as long as everything that happens  that story makes sense, we're willing to continue playing the game. This is the 'circle of plausible possibilities.' If the boy who can see dead people suddenly becomes an award-winning chef and gets a TV cooking show, we don't like it because it distracts from where the story was going. If the story and the characters don't remain consistent with the premise, we are left unfulfilled.Let's address how these take place in two of Shyamalan's films, 'The Sixth Sense', and 'Signs.'In 'Signs', Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, an ex-priest who lost his faith after his wife died in a freak auto accident. When crop circles suddenly appear around the world, followed by a hostile invasion of aliens, he begins to wonder about his own faith in God and the meaning of life. Challenged to face his own demise (and that of his family), he desperately searches for true signs, purposes to life, anything to help him come to terms with his situation, and the ultimate meaning of life. Yet, during the struggle for survival, he pieces together what had appeared to be unrelated statements or events from his past, enabling him to save his family and regain his faith in God.Here, the suspension of disbelief is 'aliens attack from outer space.' The circle of plausible possibilities include ways he deals with that, and his personal search for the meaning of life. Whether he actually saves his family, or how, is not really important. The  story, and the one the audience is really watching -- is the development of his character. How does  come to terms with his own loss of faith? How does he reconcile the struggle between logic and faith, the two classic opposites that challenge most people in their quest for belief in higher powers? These are universal themes, and we're given a story that promises to tell us something new.  What we are looking for is something that brings him around to whatever conclusion he's going to come to.  Yet, when we are given the surprise at the end, which suggests that there are no coincidences, and that everything happens for a reason, and God has a reason for everything, this premise is presented so unambiguously, so far-fetched, that it falls outside of the circle of possibilities for this story line. It's not that it  be the case, but it detracts from the story we were being told. All of Hess' objectives are gone. It's as though God himself spoke to him and said, 'it's like this'. All you can say now is, 'oh, ok.' What happened to the story we were being told?In 'The Sixth Sense', the same thing happens: the suspension of disbelief involves a boy that can see dead people. The other story involves two characters with personal struggles: the aforementioned boy and his relationship with his mother and others in his environment; and a child psychologist who has to deal with his own inner demons and his failing relationship with his wife and search for personal meaning.  The circle of possibilities includes all the ways that these people have to face and deal with these problems. Whatever happens to help them come to terms psychologically with their searches is fine--as long as they come to discover something about what they're looking for. However, the surprise ending shows us that none of these issues are even relevant anymore, so we can toss out all the invested emotions we put into them. Their stories no longer matter.In each movie, the endings are surprises because they addressed a simple 'fact' of the backdrop -- how it is the boy saw the psychologist, or how god now unambiguously exists. We were surprised not because we didn't see it coming (even though we didn't), we were surprised because we didn't NEED to see those stories solved. Sure, it's fun that we did see them solved, but the movie isn't over till the character's stories are concluded too. It doesn't matter that we can't predict the ending; what's important is that all endings tie together.Compare either of these films with Alfred Hitchcock's classic 'Psycho.' Here, we are lead to believe that Norman Bates and his mother live in a hotel and are killing people, and the surprise at the end shows us that it wasn't quite what we thought. Yet, the  was his psychological profile: why he did what he did, and how other characters were affected by it. This is  addressed the characters' issues; we weren't left hanging.Granted, 'complete' filmmaking is harder, since tying things together effectively requires an extra level of ingenuity that only a true master of storytelling can accomplish.  Shyamala's skill is his portrayal of the human spirit and character. He gives us three-dimension people, not just kids in a summer camp about to be murdered. These people have motivations, ambitions, goals, or losses that they need to come to terms with. He just needs to learn how to incorporate their issues with his surprise endings, so that all holes are filled.  What makes a story compelling, is the characters discovering things for themselves, through their own interpretations of events, and have the conclusion - surprise or not - come from the results of those learned lessons. Otherwise, we lose the bonding that we feel for them. Shyamalan's films are good, but not nearly worth the critical acclaim they are getting.",Null,1,1,28 August 2002
