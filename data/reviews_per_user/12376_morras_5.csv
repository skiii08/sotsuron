Ali," Definetely not just Boxing...
","The movie develops too much on the other aspects of Ali's life. All of them interesting enough to keep the movie going ok. But fighting aspects (his training and the sequence on his career) are given very low attention. Besides, boxing scenes are weak. And that is a major setback for anyone who watches a movie on the greatest boxer of all times...",6,0,0,26 August 2002
Captain Marvel," Below Marvel Standards in terms of entertainment and story; too powerful Main character
","I would also argue that there were also too many changes to Miss marvel's story we all know. Guess I could live with that, as maybe most people could, and I am saying this mostly because Miss Marvel was never a core Marvel character. But still, it is good to see respect to the history of a established character thats been around for over 25 years. Same thing happened to the Skrulls, that now have been portrayed as sort of good guys when we have seen them as anthagonists to Human race ever since they were introduced in the Marvel Universe.But the fact is the movie feels overall below Marvel high bar in terms of fun and story. Also, the heroe is too powerful. It is on a league of its own. Unless they come up with some sort of a kriptonite to balance the odds, in the way she is portrayed she could face all the characters in the MCU together with an arm tied to her back.",6,5,6,11 March 2019
Justice League," Not bad. But should have been better.
","Batman very good once again. WW too. Although I'd prefer to see the traditional versions of heroes, I liked the changed Aquaman, with a more powerful and with a badass looks and attitude. There was not much development of the character, but we all know him and he is goingo to have his own solo movie, so thats not a major problem. IMHO, Cyborg was not a choice that made sense for a JLA origin movie. He is originally a Teen Titans character. They managed to make some good sense for his being there, though. As for the Flash, he is just too differente from the character I grew up with as a DC fan. Too young and clumsy and clearly effeminate. Not that there's anything wrong with a gay character, just with the turning of Barry Allen into one.So overall it was a fun experience. But not yet the DC movie that does justice to JL.",7,1,5,17 November 2017
Signs," EXTREMELY disappointing... Real JOKE!
","There has been quite some time since a movie have disappointed me as much as this one. It goes pretty well up until the last 20 minutes, when it derails on a desperate will of putting up the two different agendas together (aliens/faith). Could work out fine, and it should have... But the director just shows how bad he is. He is far from successful, specially because spoiler here) the treatment the aliens receive in the end is pure non sense!!! The way they leave earth all of a sudden... Helloooo, havent a civilization that seems to be light years ahead of ours ever heard of space suits? Well, there is a message, beautiful and all? Yes. But the aliens in the plot are totally unnecessary for it to be delivered.Its a joke, and a real bad one.",3,1,1,4 October 2002
Donnie Darko," Interestingly weird
","That kind of movie that gets better the more you think of it. Though I haven't been able to get a consensus wrap up with friends that have seen it too, the incredible thing is that I couldn't find anyone who hasn't been caught up by its weirdness. Go get it.",8,0,0,30 August 2002
