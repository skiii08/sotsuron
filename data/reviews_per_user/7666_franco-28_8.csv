Alien 3," Ripley has done all she could in the fight.
","Ripley took the fight to the Aliens as no one else did, she single handedly destroyed more Aliens than anyone could, By the end of this flick, she had given her all, its great work, great acting, great special effects. Gore, suspence, the fear of not being safe, its all here.  Highly underated movie, it didnt make the fame it deserves but still impresive.  I highly recomend this to all horror fans.",Null,1,2,13 October 1999
Alien: Resurrection," not bad...
","When I heard they were making Alien 4, I thought NO! Ripley has done enough, she gave her life as the final act of destroying the aliens, but when I saw the film I was impressed, Ripleys come back was believable & as usual Weavers performance was compelling.  1 could feel the desparate situation, the fear, & the bond that made enemies friends.",10,6,9,28 October 1999
Alien," A great original work.
","At this point in time, I have seen up to Alien Resurection & I still have to admire the original concepts in Alien.  This film had chills, it was gross, it kept you on the edge of your seat, I liked it when I first saw it & still do.  It still is scary, even when you know what is going to happen.  Great acting, special effects, directing, etc.",10,0,1,13 October 1999
Aliens," One of the best action/horror movies ever!
","Being a former Marine myself, I identify with this part of the Alien movies, I like the way they had the 'boot' lt who had no experience in charge (SNAFU) Paul Riser has always been a villian in my eye since this flick, even playing opposite Hellen Riser in Mad About You, has never changed his character to me.  What can I say about Weaver that hasnt already been said, she is the perfect individual to rid our galaxy of these intergalactic cockroaches!  I have seen this flick over & over & it just gets better & better, its my personal favorite Alien movie.",10,1,2,13 October 1999
The Exorcist," excellence in film
","Here is one of the finest films that 1 can see, it has a feeling of horror that lasts way beyond the end of the movie. The acting, script, plot, & effects were beyond the norm. This is one film that isnt necesary to remake, it is fine as is, how can you top it? I especially like the ending as it kind of leaves you wondering what 1 would do in the same situation. Excellent.",10,0,1,29 October 1999
The Evil Dead," Superb work!
","Raimi, is one of the best directors around he had little to work with & made it into a lot more, this film had chills, gore, & great scenes.  A must for all horror fans. The camera work was outstanding!  The build up to scenes could scarcely be done better, dialog, well, it left a lttle bit to be desired but the 2 sequels made up for it, this was basically a fledgling attempt, that much like the Blair Which Project, just took off with the original ideas.  Highly recomended is the Evil Dead.",10,0,0,13 October 1999
Army of Darkness," A great work of art
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's a slapstick comedy/horror with a silly hero with tons of 1 liners.  Sam Raimi set out to make a movie that would be in a horror setting but silly, & he did so with my highest commendation.  Bruce Campbell is the wacky hero who saves the day & the world.  Based on the original 'Evil Dead' which was more horror based with great camera work, Army of Darkness continues the story line with ever increasing cleverness.  It, as is the case with all things, is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of dark humor, then watch this flick.",10,1,1,12 October 1999
Evil Dead II," funny, scary, original.
","Sam Raimi has some of the best movies, Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, the list goes on but Dead by Dawn; Evil Dead II is a masterpiece.  Scenes of his dead girlfriend dancing 1/2 rotted for him with her head coming off, the laughing furniture, Bruce Campbells 1 liners, the A-team style combat readiness, Ted Raimi's portrayal of the demon mother, it's all too good.  I have watched this film over 100 times & still love it.  Tons of blood, Candarian Demons, evil going ons.  I suggest it to all horror fans.",10,1,1,13 October 1999
