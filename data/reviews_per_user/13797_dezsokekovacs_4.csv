The Avengers," Hihihi - Hahaha
",Questions: 1. Giant robotic prehistoric whales swimming in the air? 2. The nuke is the best weapon in the Universe? 3. Every villain dies like in Independence Day (probably because they minds were connected)? 4. The cube has the power to destroy the Universe (strongest then the Big Bang)? 5. Hulk beat the s**t out of Loki? 6. The flying carrier has no radar so they attacked it with no warning? 7. No US army? Seven ? are enough for first (and definitely the last) view.,1,34,81,18 May 2012
Gravity," 3D vs. Plot
","In my opinion 3D represents the package of the plot, so if you want to make a good movie, first of all you must take a good plot and wrap it in a beautiful 3D package. Unfortunately almost every 3D movie being made these days by the big production companies are bulls**ts wrapped in 'outstanding' packages. For a clear view of the quality of a movie, first you must see it in 2D and if it's good then you go to see it in 3D (like I did with 'Life of Pi', for example). After reading so many reviews I figured it out that there are two kinds of peoples: the stupid, mindless people, products of the consumer society, for whom the package is the most important thing, no matter what's in it and the people who are not too lazy to use their brains and who are disgusted of such a huge amount of mediocrity they try to sell us, telling us, through the voice of the critics paid by them, that they are masterpieces. The fist kind is the majority so they will make more stupid movies for stupid people's money.I could and I will use this review for almost all the 3D movies they made since 2009's Avatar (which, by the way, in my opinion, it's a decent movie â€“ I saw it only in 2D).",1,17,37,15 October 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Money. money, money ...
","This film wasn't made for the LOTR fans; it was made for those who were born after the LOTR was made.It looks like a Walt Disney Picture movie (they even sing songs) or an RPG (role-playing game) like Dungeon Siege II. I read in some reviews that this movie looks like 'The fellowship of the ring'. FALSE! The beauty of 'The fellowship of the ring' consists in the mortality of the main characters, like Gandalf and Boromir. The hobbit is more like Ice Age: Bilbo & Co. looks like Manfred & Co, they are all immortals. And there is another significant difference: while in the LOTR the most of the villains were real, in 'The hobbit' every of them are CGI.I saw it in 3D, 24 fps but when it was filmed with fast camera motion I can't saw a damn thing, everything was shaky. So, what was the point of making the movie in 24 fps? I think the point is: if you pay more you can see everything, at 48 fps.And another thing: I don't care if the book has only 300 pages because there are a lot of movies (some of them are very good ones) based on short stories (easy to find on IMDb by using the keywords 'based on short story'). I was expecting for another 9 hour epic masterpiece, made in a LOTR way, but ...I think the film is more like a 5, but I'm giving it a 1 because I think that it's too much 10 ratings. I've been waiting for this movie for years and I never thought that I will write such a negative review.",1,26,54,19 December 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," This movie isn't entertaining (exept maybe for the Thanos fans)
","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. 
At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!
This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big 'idiotic' bam.
The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half. I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?",3,121,283,28 April 2018
