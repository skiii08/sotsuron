Requiem for a Dream," Intense, dark, deep, moving
","Some people don't like films like this.  They call them depressing.  I have to say that I find a lot of happy, jolly, false stuff unbelievable and depressing a lot more than stuff like this.  Admittedly, Requiem is frighteningly intense in places; but this is a quality which is rarely found nowadays; only Magnolia in parts and oddments of Fight Club compare to this in terms of nerve-shattering emotional intensity.  Or perhaps Monkey Trouble.  Only joking :).  Ellen Burstyn plays a lonely widow & mother named Sara Goldfarb who becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to make herself presentable for a TV appearance she applies for.  This becomes the focus for her lonely existence.  Aronofsky skilfully compares this with the lives of Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend and friend who are all regular Heroin users.  Marlon Wayans in particular is fantastic as Harry's friend Tyrone, but the star is undoubtedly Burstyn who, especially in the second and third parts of the story, had me in almost constant tears.I really can't recommend this enough.  I think you know if you'll appreciate (key word that) this movie.. if you think you will, don't for god sake miss it.Stunning..10/10.",7,0,0,9 May 2001
Memento," A movie about amnesia I'll never forget
","Memento runs in reverse chronology - one of the main characters dies in the first scene.  For a split second, I thought the whole movie would flow backwards, but scenes link in and it's pretty easy to keep track, but you need full concentration!The basic plot revolves around Leonard Shelby (Pearce) who has no short term memory since the rape and murder of his wife.  He tattoos himself, takes numerous photographs and makes notes in order to conduct his life, which is focused on the task of gaining vengeance for her death.The logic of time suggests that knowing what has happened in the future would help with understanding the past - however, this is a dangerous route to follow in the case of this picture and I was constantly furrowing my brow trying to put into context what I was seeing.  I'd heard of anterograde (apologies if that's a mispelling?) amnesia before from studying Psychology and had seen a documentary about a sufferer, who's wife killed herself because she couldn't cope with the heartache of her husband not remembering her, which gave Memento a real emotional edge for me, and there were some quite poignant moments where Leonard recalls his wife and the intangiables which truly characterise 'knowing' someone..Guy Pearce (who if he keeps up like this, will never, ever be referred to as 'Mike out of Neighbours' again is good in a difficult role, but the supporting cast are tremendous, especially Joe Pantoliano as Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, two of Lenny's 'friends'. 
It's hard to say too much about this without spoiling it, so I'd just recommend anyone to give this a go.. It's certainly not your average run of the mill revenge thriller, but it is engrossing from start to finish and the 2 hours seemed to pass in about half the time!9/10.",Null,0,0,22 January 2001
Billy Elliot," Absolutely stunned
","Billy Elliot is the story of a young lad from the North-East of England in the early 1980s whose Mother has passed away and is being brought up by his Father & Brother.  Both are Miners involved in the strikes.  Beyond that, I advise you to go and see it yourself!Slow at the start, but once into the meat and bones of the story you set off on an emotional rollercoaster.  Incredibly poignant scenes are immediately followed by brazen comic sequences.  The fruity language throughout helps with the realism as you feel that in other hands, this could've been Disney material.  As I was growing up at a similar time, a lot of this rings true, and lots of childhood memories came flooding back (some nice, some long forgotten) and I was a gibbering wreck by the end.  There are plenty of amazing characters in this, from the hothead brother, the senile Gran and the effeminate boy down the road who has a paricularly soft spot for Billy.Absolutely stunning.  If you like this, then I recommend The Straight Story, the only film of recent years to have a similar emotional effect on me.",7,2,4,4 December 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Good but flawed
","Superbly shot, excellent cast and effects.  The tree of death was fantastic. There was a slight style over content problem, and the moment of revelation I wasn't really satisfied with - having someone basically tell you a story instead of you seeing it - It smacked of 'Oh heck, we've done 2 hours, whadda we do?!' and was disappointing.  But otherwise, pretty good and worth seeing.",5,0,0,13 August 2000
Rosemary's Baby," Disturbingly believable
","A wonderfully disturbing story about a woman who fears she is carrying the Devil's child, it sounds a difficult task to make a convincing movie out of it, but under Polanski's direction and with an amazing performance from Mia Farrow as Rosemary, this is an absolute gem.Tales of witchcraft are as old as the hills, as are many of the witch-type characters whose heads surface during the course of the just over 2 hours running time.  The claustrophobic atmosphere and paranoia that engulf Rosemary as she realises exactly what has been going on is palpable.  This is a definite precursor to The Exorcist in terms of brooding suspense, and although there is very little visually that is horrific, I came away from Rosemary's Baby with a real feeling of sickness in my gut and feeling genuinely unnerved.Excellent 9/10.",9,0,1,8 May 2001
Am√©lie," Mindblowingly imaginative, magical but a bit overlong
","Amelie is a beautiful film.  Visually it is absolutely stunning, with some marvelous sequences that delight the eye; the story is wonderful, quite well balanced although (only very) occasionally becoming saccharine.The first third introduces you to Amelie as a child and her family. This is superbly done, at a frenetic pace with delicious jaunty humour and is truly inspiring to watch.  Particularly good is the development of the characters; many have endearing quirks which are wonderfully explained in a comical quasi-documentary style.  'Amelie' is perfect in every way up to and including Amelie's first good deed, a moment which is truly wonderful to experience and as life affirming as anything I've seen since The Straight Story.  After this, the movie is a little less inspiring, detailing the peripheral people in Amelie's town and their lives.  Were it not for the momentum lost in this section, this would undoubtedly be a 10/10 picture.  Some of the repeated jokes (gnomes, confusing grocers) begin to lose their edge.  The feel of the film here becomes more reminiscent of 'Delicatessen', also directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.However, the final third picks up on shy Amelie's quest for love and regains some of the vigour previously lost.  Audrey Tautou is brilliant in the title role, and it's good to see Matthieu Kassovitz (writer and director of La Haine) in the wonderful role of Nino.  All credit, it's a lot harder too make a good 'feelgood' film than a cynical one, and Jeunet has succeeded with aplomb here.9/10.",9,0,1,16 October 2001
High Fidelity," Warm and sad
","As a music obsessed 25 year old single male..this film is aimed right at my consciousness!  And it mostly hit the mark.  Extra points for Stereolab obscurities, Belle & Sebastian album tracks and The Beta Band (even if only 20 seconds!).Seriously, this is a warm but sad tale of an anal but well intentioned record store owner who has been through a series of failed relationships and is trying to analyse what is wrong with him.  This analysis is going on on the back of a split up with Laura, who is No.5 in his all-time hardest break-ups list (I told you he was anal!).John Cusack and the whole cast are excellent, the characters well observed, the script full of laughs and emotion.  I haven't read the book so I can't judge it against that, but I would recommend the film to anyone, but especially post youth music obsessed folk.8/10.",5,0,1,16 April 2001
