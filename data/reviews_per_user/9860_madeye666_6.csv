Black Swan," A masterpiece.
","I am absolutely speechless. I keep trying to formulate words to describe this magnificent film, and I just cannot adequately express it.If you are an artist of almost any performance type, mostly an actor or a dancer, you will relate almost frighteningly closely with this movie. The journey that Nina descends into after being rewarded with the role of the Swan Queen is a journey that any performer who has ever taken on any role that has challenged them can identify with.The explosive climax is one that will be talked about for years to come. No matter what conclusion you come to, there will be someone else that can find a hole in your theory. Vincent Cassell, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder all deliver nuanced performances that transcend the lines of a supporting performance. They are all absolutely stunning and scene-stealing.However, not a single performance in the film, nor any performance in any film in the past year and possibly the last five years, can overcome what Natalie Portman has achieved. She has completely defined exactly what she portrays in this film: she has completely and totally transformed into Nina, and done so without breaking a sweat. She is mind-altering good. She is perfect. If she doesn't win an Academy Award for this performance, than nothing is right in the world. She is beautiful, sexy, dangerous, and absolutely flawless, and she delivers a performance that is perfect because it is not a performance; it is real.There are surely a thousand more things to say about this film, but as I have stated, I cannot form the words. If you don't see Black Swan, you are missing out on one of the true masterpieces of our generation. See it.",10,5,11,28 December 2010
Marie Antoinette," Sofia Coppala's Best Film by Far
","After a betrothement, Marie heads off to France, stripped (almost literally) of all Austrian background. Her marriage is awkward, and after the two soon find themselves ruling.It is possible this is the best picture of the year. It was the most beautifully written, most expertly modernized, and the most fantastically directed film I have seen in recent times. Antoinette was like a rockstar, uncaring of the peoples' view of her and almost tragically uncareful. It was stunning. After seeing it, there is nothing but fireworks, large hair, beautiful costumes, and absolutely sensational set design. It was stylized to a point where it was no longer a film about Marie Antoinette. It was a film about the royal lifestyle, a satire on how royalty was a modern day kind of celebrity.I was moved by this film. I have never been so stunned by Kirsten Dunst (except perhaps in Interview with the Vampire). She held her role almost swimmingly. It was one of my favorite performances of the year. Equally fabulous acting was contributed by Jason Schwartzmen.The directing was perfection. It was definitely part of the stylization. The last film that opened my eyes to a way of stunning directing was the marvel American Beauty. Indefinitely, this was the most finely directed film of the year.The writing is phenomenal. Sofia Coppala has always had a way with words, and it shines through in Marie Antoinette. She surpassed Lost in Translation by about seven billion points. It is, again, the most expertly written film of the year.My one complaint has been the way the main character is portrayed. You get a feel of her emotions, thanks to Ms. Dunst, but you don't feel like you know her and how she feels about the people around her properly by the end. Its probably some tragic editing mishap, but there is just something missing from the character.It is hardly noticed though. The film is a tour de force. Its fantastic.",10,0,2,22 May 2009
Beauty and the Beast," The Second in the Nineties Golden Age
","Film-Beauty and the Beast Rating-G Creator-Walt Disney Feature Animation Release Year-1991With it's classic story, memorable characters, dramatic songs, and under toned villain, this film is one that absolutely deserves it's place in Disney's coveted 'Platinum' line of DVDs. Now come along with me as I explore these three sections of the film-the Villain, the DVD, and instead of comic relief, the Music.Gaston is the rude and conceited man who tries to get Belle to marry him through his achievements and looks, and as a child you wouldn't see that this man is the dramatic villain, until the final sequences. His song, 'Let's Kill the Beast,' truly captures his intentions, and to me, is what truly made this film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.The 2002 Platinum release of this title was dazzling. The disc offered three versions of the film, a beautiful making of feature, wonderful packaging, and of course, silly games for the kids. It's a DVD worth buying, yet maybe not buying to wait for it's upcoming new Platium release in the years to come.And now for probably the best part of this film, the Broadway style music. Composing the film is Alan Menken, the genius behind 'The Little Mermaid (1989)' who brings this film to stunning style musically, with it's basis of theatrical dramatic songs, and having the range to do the silly songs as well. And then of course, there is the glue between film and music, the lyricist for the film, the late Howard Ashman. His witty style doesn't dumb down for any age. It's glamor when needed, and fun when wanted, is witty and catchy-these songs will forever stay in your mind. Howard Ashman test HIV positive in production of this film, and died a few months before it's release. Fans of his work know this as his last true film, although he contributed some work to 'Aladdin (1992)' though the lyricist for that is mainly Tim Rice. All in all, Beauty and the Beast is a golden triumph among the Golden ages, and should not lose it's place in any home. With it's fabulous villain, magnificent DVD, and genius music, it's no wonder that so many fans find this their favorite Disney film.Walt Disney Pictures Beautiful Classic, Beauty and the Beast",8,1,1,16 April 2007
Cars," PIXAR's weakest effort.
","Without a doubt, PIXAR creates truly memorable films, not only for children, but for adults as well: Toy Story (1 and 2), A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. (and more since than, but for the sake of fairness, I'm reviewing from a THEN standpoint.) But when I saw Cars for the first time in theaters, I remember walking out feeling two things: disappointment and somewhat confusion.I was confused by the storyline of the film: a rude, arrogant, conceited car is thrust into a town of humble, down to earth cars. He's rude and obnoxious to them, and than changes very, very suddenly. And than we're supposed to care for him? Sure, he does admirable things towards the end of the film, but with a character so grounded in stereotype to change in an instant to another stereotype is something that PIXAR has never done before, and shocks me. I felt no sympathy at any point for Lightning McQueen, or any of the other characters except Mater, who though comedic, is a character with originality and appeal.My disappointment ran so deep because I was expecting, for the first time EVER, TOO much of PIXAR. I expected something heartfelt, meaningful, deep, and ultimately fantastic, and instead I was given something that was shallow, clich√©, somewhat boring, and ultimately just a DECENT film from a company that usually creates NEAR-PERFECT film.PIXAR has since redeemed themselves: The fantastic Ratatouille, and three pitch-perfect MASTERPIECES: WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3.But now that the next film in PIXAR's canon coming down the line is a sequel to the film that was so dismally decent in my opinion, I find myself somewhat worried for a spotless reputation the company have given themselves.Please PIXAR...prove me wrong.",7,1,2,21 June 2010
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," A Masterpiece At Least
","Film-'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' Rating-G for General Audiences Creator-Walt Disney Release Year-1937From the timeless melodies of 'I'm Wishing,' and 'Heigh Ho,' to the ballads of 'Someday My Prince Will Come,' and 'One Song,' the world's first full length animated feature is a brilliant sensation. It is a singularly amazing triumph, with memorable characters, catchy songs, and a fairy tale setting, this film outlined the recipe of old and upcoming films, like RAPUNZEL.The most chilling part of this film-the dramatic villain-the Evil Queen, who turns herself into a hag to kill Snow White, so she can be 'Fairest in the land.'And this film has it's place as the most fantastic DVD debut of all time for a Disney film. I do not have the discs, but borrowed them from a friend once, and I was in deep shock with the dazzling restoration in picture and sound.The comic relief is a most spectacular hilarity in this film. With the Seven Dwarfs-Happy, Bashful, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy and most memorable of all Dopey, this film is a pure treat with it's innocent charm in the department of comedy.All in all, this film is a sheer joy-Spotless. It is a dazzling triumph and holds a place in everyone's heart. It is the most memorable of all Disney films.Walt Disney's Timeless Classic, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!'",10,3,3,7 March 2007
