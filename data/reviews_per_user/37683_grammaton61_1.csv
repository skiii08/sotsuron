Sucker Punch," Action that puts a smile on your face
","I loved Sucker Punch, and count it as my favorite truly action-centered movie, even above The Matrix. The story and premise was great regardless of critical viewers' opinions. The opening to the movie set the tone and also pressed the theme of abuse which added the bitter element needed to keep the movie gripping. Sucker Punch is in a genre that is otherwise largely dominated by childish components, so a mature tone without the explicitness is noteworthy. Some of my favorite movies include Gladiator, Defiance, and Blood Diamond, both for their real-to-life injustices and bitter-sweet endings. To be honest, Sucker Punch is not to be compared with the movies above, however, it contains elements that made those movies great, and because of that you can take it more seriously. Overall, it's an action-packed, fun, and saddening story. As a guy, obviously the beautiful and awesome girls are a major draw. But miniskirts aside, the real meaningful factor is the anger that anyone should have against the 'bad' characters in the movie. It's a good movie to get fired up about, showcasing true-to-life abuse that goes on, yet in very imagined and creative world. More can be taken from this movie than simply the most spectacular fantasy fight scenes and environments ever created.",8,3,9,5 April 2011
