First Man," One of the worst films...
",I never want to see this again. I walked out of the theater after he walks on the moon. Never seen a cast so disconnected in my life. No Tripods or steadicams except for the moon shots so if you have motion sickness DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. Same as Hurt Locker - another film I cannot watch because of all the 'over the shoulder crap'. This film has almost no music. It is like attending a funeral. Ryan smiles 5 times in the film. No emotion is what this film should be called. It is boring a lot of the time. Terrible DOP. Great Focus puller. Maybe 20 shots in the film had no movement. Only one of three films I have ever walked out on in my life. Don't see it.,2,51,95,17 October 2018
Empire of the Sun," In my Top Ten films.
","Spielberg says of this film.. it was one of his best films he made that no one saw.I think it is one of the best films I have ever seen. Looking through the eyes of a 12 year old at war. 'People will do anything for a Potato' Spielberg excels at 'Point of view' and this film does not disappoint. This film is about a series of 'moments' that confront and face our reality. It is a confront we can relate to. For a moment when the P51 attacks the Japanese in their POW camp you can feel the humanity arrive back in Jim's lungs..The photography is nothing less than spectacular. Angles & lighting. Incredible. Tired of digital people like Gladiator? They did not exist then. I like to think of this film as one of the last made with thousands of extras. Real people. Spielberg gave us a treat, an adventure in emotional torment and we are along for the ride. Trapped in a celluloid jail of which we do not get air until we leave the theater. Spielberg takes you where you don't want to go but cannot resist looking. Like a car wreck.I recommend you set aside a rainy afternoon, some popcorn, turn off your cell phone and put down your tablet. Turn off the lights and watch what happens inside of you.",10,4,9,9 June 2013
Blade Runner," Best Film Ever Made
","Visually this film is stunning. You could stop the DVD or Videotape and print the frame.. and put it on your wall it is made so well. Oddly Harrison hated the film and will never talk about it. Joseph Cronenworth - The Director of photography was so sick he was in a wheelchair. Some shots the shutter was open for over 24 hours (city) and oil drums were lit to make the smoke. It was Sean's first film. Watch for the picture of here and her mother - watch what happens to the shadows in the picture when held. THis is the last film made without ANY computer animation. THis film was voted by the American Cinematographers Association as one of the ten best films made in the last 100 years.Incredible film.. Rutger's finest acting.Go see it, do not wait. Jimwww - Producer, Vancouver, BC",10,0,1,1 September 2006
Spectre," Worst Bond FIlm Made
",Don't bother - Saw it a few hours ago. 1. Clearly the Continuity position is vacant now in Hollywood. Spiderman won for the worst in that department.. Spectre bleeds it all the time. Alfred Hitchcock fired one of the crew for moving flowers in Rear Window. 2. Thanks to digital or 4k everyone looks old. Everyone. They should have stopped with Daniel in the last film and recast a new bond. 3. Good luck with the weak story. It drags on and on. 4. Nice car chase. Bond only wrecks one Aston Martin. Not sure why the press are reporting they wrecked 20 Million dollars worth of them. 5. How does the Rolls Royce driver know when and how to pick them up? 6. Amazing how many clothes you can change into with only one bag.Save your money. I will never see it again.,3,4,10,8 November 2015
