Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," No one is that stupid - even if hes from Kazakhstan
",Cultural learnings - yeah sure - if you think Kazakhstan is a porn country Okey i have humor too - but everything about his humor is about sex in some way - and its a very jumpy movie Now to the movie itself - it starts in his hometown and its a miserable place - with cows in the house and of course the hose isn't anything but a shed. The presentation of his sister and wife and of course the rest of the people in his hometown is a little bit too much. I liked the car and the engine of witch he travels away from Kazakhstan too meet America. Finally in America he just has to kiss everyone - and who really likes that - from a two meter ling mustache man from Kazakhstan (it would have been different if it was a nice girl of course). He gets invited to all kinds of stuff when he enters America - but of course he screws all up - and of course he does - where would the fun come from if not. This Borat guy cant even use a toilet - hes from Kazakhstan. On the way in America he gets an obsession on a famous girl - and has to meet her to marry her - what a failure - i just wonder how any girl could be a part of that meeting - that is a have to see thing - poor girl. Endline - OK its a lot of humor - but do you watch this movie again - i don't think so - cos the humor is just the first time - then it isn't.,3,5,9,21 March 2007
Spartacus," its old - but still going strong
","This movie is about slaves in the acient rome and italy - the movie is folowing a slave called spartacus in his struggle against the roman empire - a struggle that makes him choose between family and war for freedom. He begins in a gladiator training camp and gets in trouble, the slaves free themselfs. A lot of them die and some donÂ´t. As the rumour spreads that slaves have freed themselfs - a lot of slaves join them in a fight through italy - to a final battle against rome. I can only say as they said themselves - a free slave is a dead slave, cos the romans killed all of them.",10,0,1,2 July 2003
