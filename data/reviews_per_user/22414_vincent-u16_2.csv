Hereditary," Guys, as a fan of the genre, don't go watch this in cinema...
","Warning! Boring! Long! Useless! Not scary! Don't waste your money! Once again it's a trap! Like they did with 'It Comes At Night'!Please, don't fall for the fake reviews and paid advertisings, As a huge fan of the genre, I have watched almost every horror movie, most of them in cinema. This one reminds me a lot of 'It Comes At Night'. Remember? Boring, Looooong.... Not scary at all... And just plain weird.
They too used the news as a way to mass advertise their failed 'art-movie'. People who are looking to have a good time and a good scare, save your money for when 'The Nun' comes out!
Please, don't waste your money on this. Trust me... I'm not even going to bother actually talking about the movie because I'm sure nobody cares. Just let this movie die and put it next to the other art-garbage that hipsters are trying to pass off as 'scary horror movies'.For the sake of fun and entertainment I hope these 'art' directors will stop trying to make horror movies.",2,2,7,10 July 2018
Minions," Better than 'Despicable Me 2'
","As a big fan of the Despicable Me movie, I was disappointed by its sequel (Despicable Me 2). And thus I hesitated a long time to go and see 'Minions'. But as I went to the movies with a friend, who wanted to see the movie, I gave it a shot. And I must say, I am happily impressed. Lots of fun and cuteness with a nice story behind all it. An enjoyable time is what you'll have if you go and watch 'Minions'. This movie speaks to everyone. Go and watch it with your family, your friends, or even your girl-/boyfriend and you won't be disappointed. So if you, like me, had doubts about this movie because Despicable Me 2 was a bit of a letdown, I'm here to tell you that they made up for it. You'll enjoy lots of laughs, lots of 'awww's, and have fun watching 'Minions'.",8,1,1,29 July 2015
