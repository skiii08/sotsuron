The Blair Witch Project," Struck a little too close to home... I need to catch my breath
","Not far from my house growing up we had many 'Indian Burial Ground' rock piles and foundations from Colonial times. My friends and I used to scare each other telling stories of witches. One day while walking in the woods among some old foundations, my two friends and I superstitiously stuck leaves on the ends of sticks stating that we were safe from witches as long as the leaves remained on our sticks. No wind came but all three leaves fell at once. My dog spooked ran back towards home with us close behind screaming... Twenty years later... I felt like doing the same at the movie theater.Never has anything been so realistically portrayed where I have to keep reminding myself that it wasn't real. I would love to see it again but I don't want to spoil the illusion. Kudos to the cast, crew, writers, and directors.",10,1,2,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cool but...
","Great effects.  Not a lot of depth or insight.  It will be interesting to see how this ship gets turned towards the Star Wars world we know.Jar-Jar Binks (the computer animated lizard guy) was too whiny.  He was an amphibious Ewok.  Unfortunately, Binks role was much too involved with the film.  Darth Maul had the opportunity to be one of the great villains of all time, but the character wasn't given enough development or film presence.Lucas' effort towards creating a family film was very apparent.  We appreciate the effort but a little more subtlety would be more appropriate. Perhaps he should watch a couple more Disney films, which can entertain children and adults with the same humor.  The balance of suspense and action with family fun wasn't even enough for us to give it anything higher than an over-all 8.  If there weren't such great special effects and it wasn't Star Wars, Jar Jar (and his annoying voice, actually mostly his annoying voice) would have dragged it down to a 6.The cinematography was phenomenal as expected.   Highlights on the cool list: all robots, the senate chamber, Darth Maul, pod racing scene, light saber duel, underwater creatures and scenery.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
