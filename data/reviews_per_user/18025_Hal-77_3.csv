The Rock," the best action movie I've seen!
","This movie will always be the best action movie in the history of Hollywood!I have seen this movie around 9 times and every time it just keeps getting better. For starters, the soundtrack accompanied with this movie is exellently done and fits the mode of the movie perfectly. And then there is by far the best chase scene ever. What better idea than a Hummer and a Farrari speeding around the hills of downtown San Francisco! everything is just so well done it will go down in my books as the best action\thriller of all time!",10,1,1,18 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," visually astonishing, worth the money.
","Well, after seeing Star Wars, I was left with that shakey feeling a person gets after riding a roller coaster. I'm guessing that I didn't blink once throughout the entire film. The cast is directed flawlessly and unlike most sequels or prequels in this case) It captures the story and the atmosphere perfectly. I would highly recommend spending the money and watching this film as soon as you can, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
Psycho," One of the best horror movies I have seen.
","Let's face it, Alfred Hitchcock was a genius! He managed to capture the true demented character of Norman Bates. In the 90's Psycho does not seem to be one of the scariest movies around. But the way Hitchock managed the lighting and camera angles, made it so obvious why this movie became such a hit. I just saw this movie a few months ago, and even then, everyone I watched it with seemed delighted to scream again at the geinius of Alfred Hitchcock.",Null,6,10,18 May 1999
