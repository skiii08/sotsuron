The Mask," One of the finest comedies ever.
","The Mask has got to be one of the best comedies ever, everything here smells originality. If you've seen a Jim Carrey movie you know his style, he tends to overdo a little sometimes but he manages to stay funny, a lot of people don't like him because of all the weird stuff he throws in while acting, but this movie can change some minds about Carrey. The Mask follows the story of Stanley Ipkins, an average guy who finds an ancient Scandinavian mask, it contains within the Norse god Loki banished and imprisoned, now whoever puts on the mask gets possesses by the joker spirit of the god gaining incredible powers and the will to cause problems.In The Mask Carrey plays two characters, one is the more-than-regular Stanley Ipkins, who's a shy fan of cartoons and works at a bank, he's not good with the ladies and the world seems to conspire against him at all costs, luck sure doesn't seem to enjoy playing on the side of Ipkins at all. The other is when he puts on the mask and transforms himself into a green-masked party-boy maniac, ready to joke all around town, all his romantic repression is unleashed and he starts acting in a cartoony style much like the cartoons he enjoys so much seeing. There are funny scenes all around but the highlights are when Carrey puts on the mask, including dance scenes; one is particularly funny because it has a cover music track of Cuban Pete sang by Carrey himself, seems like the song was destined to be funny. The movie also features the debut of Cameron Diaz when she actually looked cute and not a super-sized barbie doll.If you like Carrey you really should see this movie because it's one of the best stuff Carrey ever pulled. If you're not a fan, you can still enjoy it because he also plays a normal character that's actually normal, without the weird faces, with the crazy stuff being performed by his masked person, although the crazyness is probably boosted, it's easily understandable since he's indeed possessed. If you're still not convinced about Carrey maybe his comedies aren't for you, you can probably enjoy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind anyway.",10,7,8,27 December 2009
The Avengers," The Avengers
","I'm not exactly sure I get the hype, but this movie felt pretty sub- par. I'm not an extremist that think films should have a cult format, I do enjoy big production, though blockbusters have seen better days. They basically put together some comic book heroes of some sort and tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for having them all participate in the newest world/New York saving.Not a good idea, the rushed pace to make every character fit the length is easily noticed. I'm no super-here expert—quite the opposite —but I'm pretty sure Scarlett Johansson's past doesn't involve two parents made of stone, so I'd argue her acting is not at its finest.Not that the script helps. Hollywood makes amazing stuff but its stigma of being shallow, focused on silliness can be entirely summarized in this particular movie. The cheesy lines aiming for climatic humor, the grand scale explosions, lots of known names in the cast. Nothing really stand out because nothing has sufficient time to shine, everything feels cramped.Destruction on this scale demands a villain with capital V. Loki is never that guy. With the exception of a scene that turned out to be faked with Johansson he never looks threatening. It's hard to tell where everyone came about as well as Loki himself because every few minutes a new super-hero pop up on screen.The biggest problem in having that many unworldly people together is the fact that everyone comes from different imaginary worlds. Hulk seems to be the top dude on the street while Thor is portrayed as a god. There's also a guy that shoots arrows. Scarlet's character also seems to have a gymnast-like elasticity and a way too harsh personality for having just that. The desperate attempt to make everyone's role slightly equal is absurd.The effect are top-notch after all. Expected from a blockbuster of this magnitude. This might appeal to hardcore fans of comics but I can't see how anyone would enjoy it beyond that. At being a dumb- action movie it does a pretty awful job.",3,3,8,9 February 2015
500 Days of Summer," I'm impressed.
","I'm impressed by this movie. At first I thought it would be just another romantic comedy, then I thought it would be a very good romantic comedy, and finally I found out it was something completely apart from all that. The narrator advised this wasn't a story of love, I grasped that as something they wouldn't play with, turns out he was right, this is actually a pretty depressing movie. Not by a mere generic kind of way, the boy loses girl and that's that. We actually feel he has lost something, and something he had absolute chances of getting, actually, it's revolting. The two main roles are played naturally, the girl has a mystery going on throughout the entire film, we never get the feeling we completely understood her; the boy is more of an open book, a shy guy who lost much of his aspirations even though he had lots of potential.500 days of Summers actually refers to a girl named Summer and her relationship with the man-protagonist, from the first day, the day they met, until the last one. I would divide the film in three parts, two of them are the part with them getting along well and the one where they weren't, these two are interchanged during most of the film in no chronological order, for a good insight on their relationship overall. Until it reaches almost the end, the last part, and it starts following the correct order of events to finally come to an end. The support roles are pretty good as well, mainly with the guy's friends -- they share similar personalities with the protagonist. I also thought the comedy moments were great, lately I've been having some problems with comedies, they all seem rehashes and leave you with the feeling that you've heard or saw that one before, sometimes even many times before, that's something never actually occurred to me while watching this movie, even when you think that the main characters' overall personalities don't stray too much away from the romantic comedy cliché, but the way they are presented feels fresh.Well, so much for the heart-warming romantic comedy, even so this ends up being a very touching movie. It's just that it's more of an encouraging 'get out of your seat and so something' style than it is a 'don't worry, everything's gonna be all right'. Either way, an amazing movie nonetheless, full of freshness.",8,1,2,4 November 2009
Barry Lyndon," Barry Lyndon
","Sometimes we forget that technology can change how we see things. This movie was released in 1975 but has such memorable, vivid scenery that's it's hard to imagine a movie that hasn't been tainted by the unforgiving test of time. If movies are moving images then this is one, images moving the eyes and soul.Every scene takes its time for the viewer to savor every bit of detail. Some of them are especially tasty, building tension as it goes by. I'm of course mentioning the two duel scenes. The second one is a test for the heart. The story about a humble guy that rises and falls is amazingly told. His love affairs, trickery, the desperate attempt to rise in 18th- century England. From the sharp voice lines to the monumental soundtrack. And of course, the last line in the movie which puts a lot of things in perspective. Truly a landmark.",9,3,5,2 February 2015
Collateral," Masterpiece! - Absolutely brilliant thriller!
","OK guys, what we have here is not just one of the best suspense, thriller films, not quite one of the best 2004 movies, but indeed one of the best movies ever made! The greatness of this movie can't be described in words, you gotta see it. The film focuses on Vincent and Max, Vincent is a hit-man hired to take some witnesses down, and Max is a taxi driver, Vincent hires Max for the whole night to do his job - of course the taxi driver doesn't know what kind of job yet - and get to the airport fast enough, but you know, things happens...Most of the movie the action is set inside the cab, with conversations between max and Vincent, they talk about life, experiences, universe, you get to see both points of view, and then you realize that their relationship gets deeper, it's not just a sociopath and his collateral inside a cab preparing for the slaughter, there's jokes, hangouts, and even parent visits, while Vincent prefers to think that as his job, Max condemns it.The atmosphere created is outstanding, 95% of the movie happens at night, just the beginning that doesn't, and with it they really got to make the best of a metropolitan city night, and along with the excellent atmosphere created, the soundtrack contribute to set the perfect mood, simply amazing! The acting is stunning, I always liked Tom Cruise's job, but with this he made nothing less than the best acting of his whole career, we can say the same for Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith was just great and Mark Ruffalo did a fantastic job as well! And acting turns out to be not much of a problem when the plot is asmagnificent as this is, just pure original and nicely thought-out storyline! After watching it in VHS, I had to buy it, and I did, yes I did, I got the special 2 DVD set, and expect to buy the soundtrack pretty soon! It's that good!",10,4,6,12 December 2006
Resident Evil," Just crap
","This movie is a total crap, there's nothing related with the game, which is one of the best video-games series of all time... I guess they tried to make the movie enjoyable for the people who already knew Resident Evil and the people who never heard about the game or the series story.... When they started with that 'the hive' bullshit I just wanted to die! Where was the Resident Evil that I was expecting since I knew they were making a Resident evil movie?.... If you're a Resident Evil fan you can watch this, but don't expect to see that much of classical elements of the games here....just an average action movie....nothing more than it.....",2,0,1,24 January 2006
Quantum of Solace," Usual Bond, still amazing!
","I loved this movie, what you find here is the typical James Bond. Car chases, explosions, pretty secret agent girls, rooftop chases, bullets, absolute power seekers, stunts defying common sense, and all that. What's not to like? Ever since I first saw the introduction to Cassino Royale I knew Daniel Craig was the right man for the job, and once more he proves me right. You have to understand that I'm all Pierce generation, I grew up playing Goldeneye, always saw his movies in the cinema and actually thought his face was James Bond's face period. But now I've embraced this change, and actually enjoy very much, even more than Brosnan's movies -- except maybe Goldeneye, a guy can have his weakness.This follows the story where Cassino Royale left off. The menaces to the planet's safety are actually all new, but James Bond still haven't recovered from the death, and betrayal, of his girlfriend in the last movie, and he is haunted by this ghost of the past during this one. The story is well developed as always, it's about a secret organization trying to control the water resources of Bolivia; it was nicely thought-out but what really shines are the moments of action, much more enjoyed if seen in the large screen. Daniel Craig, great as always, plays a more centered Bond, and seems much more lethal, especially now motivated by vengeance.There's not much to say about this, it's a James Bond film, like many others released, except this one takes advantage of more advances in technologies and increasing development costs. Come and see James Bonds on his usual life-threatening adventures, it's worth to notice that a high definition TV and a good sound system would make you enjoy the ride a lot more.",7,1,10,5 November 2009
The Dark Knight," Batman's new style continues strong.
","It's hard for me to think of a movie which I had more expectations than The Dark Knight, I guess I can thank Batman Begins' ending for that, the way the plot was left for sequel possibilities was genius, and I'm not even a comic book nor a Batman fan, I imagine the effect that caused to some of those. The Joker card presented with information about a new criminal with a theatric vein just like Batman was the thing that caught me. And here it is, Dark Knight is not only a commercial success but also a critics success.The plot revolves greatly upon the Joker, incredibly played by Heath Ledger, and that's fine, but I believe not even the producers and the director ever thought this impact would be so unbalanced. Heath Ledger is the soul and body of the film. It all started in Begins, where Batman was reinvented to a more plausible manner, out with the weird costume with the underwear wore outside the pants, in with the high-technology suit giving a mere human abilities no other would match. Sounded too good to be true, but they did it amazingly. Now with the Joker they did the same, the Joker is a mysterious guy, it would be somewhat pointless to just have someone out there making jokes in a more mature Batman movie, so now even Joker's smile has a reason, he's got scars on his face that along with make-up form the infamous smile, the actual reason is uncertain due to the character's playful personality throughout the movie. Dark Knight's Joker is a blend of a chaotic, anarchic, mysterious and with a good sense of humor character, the result is an amazing personality that fits perfectly to Batman's new approach and is also stunningly played by Heath Ledger.The rest of the movie is good and it never goes beyond that, with solid performances from all the other actors. I must admit that the absence of Katie Holmes worried me a little bit prior to the release of Dark Knight, but my worries turned out worthless, Maggie Gyllenhaal did a fine job. The overall atmosphere still has that dark touch. The ending, again, leaves much room for a sequel, and I certainly hope they get started with that soon, now with a new villain, developed during the story of this one. In the end this movie survived the high amount of hype it was thrown against it, but it won't receive a maximum score for the simple fact that the rest of the movie didn't really accompany the massive success of the Joker, and without him this would be more of another great action movie than anything else. But the way it is, it's an amazing experience that shouldn't be missed.",9,1,2,5 November 2009
3 Idiots," Some cringy moments here and there, but overall quite bold in its message
","Those Indians seem to be up for the challenge of putting out movies that Hollywood wouldn't really venture into. I hate art-sy movies that depend their own existence on some hidden fundamental meaning of how human existence is badly guided and the directors (artists know nothing about sociology, as much as they want to think otherwise) simply hand out the answers in a silver plate.The main character seems like the run-of-the-mill politically correct guy that thinks 'being yourself' is one of the best pieces of advice you could ever grant someone with. As the movie flows his complete lack of respect for authority gets more coherent with what he preaches. Basically you have a few students that are graduating in engineering while having to cope with an extremely perfectionist professor. While the protagonist believes that the imagination of the students is as much an education problem as studying hours upon hours immersed in technical books. Their world views collide when Poncho, the main guy, falls in love with the professor's daughter. This is a funny movie while maintaining a strong message of not having to choose a high-pay job to be successful. Contradictions are bound to arrive, like family problems and old ways that always seem to die hard.Just forget that the film is desperately trying to output some kind of universal happiness through doing whatever you feel like doing in your life, getting ever closer to a modern day fairy-tale than the cheesy foreign comedy.",7,1,3,14 July 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Not impressed.
","I'll go ahead and speak plainly about events from the movie, not caring too much about spoiling or not. If you haven't seen the movie and do not want the major plot twists told beforehand you should avoid this review.I must admit I was one of those guys who went on a hunt for this movie just because it is the highest rated movie on this website. It was second place on general public top 250 when I decided I had to see it. Not to mention most recent high-rated films I am familiar with to a point of remembering, or hearing about; this one wasn't the case.To tell the truth I watched the movie three times now and I still haven't seen anything resembling greatness to be the highest acclaimed film in the most important website about cinema in the planet.It's not bad, but I found overshadowed by the immense hype surrounding it. It's certainly 7/10 material in my book, but the idiotic fanboys along with the constant praise for it being superior film-making just slides it down a notch or two.The story about a guy that is innocently convicted and how his life develops inside the prison with a friend named Red and a few surprises here and there is well told. The so-called message it carries? Well, it seems people are all about that 'hope' thing since he indeed is innocent of the crime he's in for, and how eventually he escapes prison leaving behind a hostile environment that never really believed in him, a warden that exploited his dry as much as he could, and of course beating the error of the system in his own game.He loses his whole life while at it though, but who cares, it's all about hope. It's hard to relate anything to real life since even the finale seems too wonderful to be true. The guy just goes to an obscure island and lives happily ever after. Even Red drops by when he's finally out on parole. Great deal.After 30 years digging a tunnel with a miniature pickaxe after being wrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit and stealing from the corrupt warden in the process sounds the absolute catharsis for some, I thought it was sad, sad that he lost his whole life in a prison, sad that he had to put up with all that crap for so long, sad that he must have been reintegrated after a while if somehow his story went on. Call me a pessimist, but that's not hope.I sometimes wonder what so many people saw in this movie that I was the only one on planet earth who did not quite 'get it'. The only thing this movie taught me more than anything else is that democracy is not always the best regime. What did every one suddenly see that back in 1994 people did not? Maybe it's an internet this right? Internet stuff, that serious business. This strange Leviathan that transforms unknown South-Korean pop singers in music sensations and record-holders for most watched movie on the planet. The internet, maybe someone watched it and thought it would be funny to invent a secret message, so deep, so unworldly, so incredible and anyone who could not 'see it' was instantly deemed unworthy.That monster that drives everyone to think this average movie should be considered some kind of demigod due to its averageness. We see that because we're average, enlightened beings see greatness, colossal messages within that lifts the human spirit, cleanse our souls with its reach.The movie was good, and that's about it.",6,0,0,3 September 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","Quite a hard task to live up to its two predecessors. The first Batman was a landmark because it marked the change of direction. Less silliness from comics, more focused on a strong, tangible storyline. Of course we're talking about a superhero here. The Dark Knight wasn't all that great if you think about it, Heath Ledger took the scene though and made it especially memorable.The third and final statement might not have received the extensive hype of its direct predecessor but the overall result is even better. The movie's main antagonist Bane gives us a memorable performance, it simply won't be easily compared because the Joker is essentially more charismatic. Also, Ledger's death over-hyped everything about his impeccable job, turning him into a legend in no time. I wouldn't want to face a task that difficult.Tom Hardy takes on this like there's no tomorrow and bring a performance comparable to Ledger's. Although the nature of the Joker makes him much more easier to stand out, Bane's got something on his favor. The story surrounding everything is much stronger. The dialogs are full of witty moments. There's so much happening and everything seems to somewhat be linked with everything that comes next.The twists are more recurrent, in the last movie action was based on how disturbingly ingenious the Joker's next move would be. This movie inserts important plot links all over the place. Unfortunately for Nolan this is the last movie of the series and might lack a ground-breaking aspect to it. Not in the sense of quality because quality is there. Lots of it in the strong screenplay, the stylish main villain, the background supporting what's being shown. What this movie lacks, and this is mostly an advertising thing, which ultimately leads to memorability, is a title to go by.Pretty much like Begins is 'the new Batman' and Dark Knight is 'Heath Ledger'. If you compare them without the rose-tinted glasses you'll find that Rises has as much or even more quality as the other two.",9,2,3,27 January 2015
Sin City," Sin City - You have never seen a film like this!
","I love it when you watch a film, and end up thinking 'wow I didn't see that coming! That was good!', It happened to me with Sin City, a lot was being talked about this movie, but I always stick to my criticism about large amount of hype, and that criticism is simple, It doesn't work! Sure, people started talking about how good it was and stuff, but I didn't had ears for that kind of chat, I kept on living until a certain point that a friend of mine said she had bought this movie, and asked me if I wanted to see it, of course I said yes, and I'm glad I said yes! What a joy! At first I though it was one strange film, all uncolored, highly violent, weird stories about helping people you barely know, killing, killingand then it hit me, this is Sin City, it ain't the City of Beauty, it is chaotic, trashy and nasty, it is the city of corruption and violence, and I love it!! Three stories connected to each other, but each one of them with its own focuses, and they pretty much look like what they should, a comic book transformed into a film, the dialogs are sharp and tight, some very poetical, referencing persons as goddess and such things.The choice of the actors to play the roles were very good, I can't firmly cite better actors for the characters, since all of them did such a great jog, the one actor that happened to be not-so-good on the screen was Jessica Alba, she was OK, but surrounded by actor that surpassed all my expectations about the film, I found her doing the least enjoyable job, but even so, a very decent acting. The highlights goes to Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen. I didn't have doubts about Clive Owen doing or not a good job, he was born for this kind of character, dark and mysterious. Mickey Rourke was the best in my opinion, everything about his acting was outstanding, voice, acting, lines, characterization.I strongly recommend this movie, it's a piece of pure dark art, full of action, suspense and memorable lines, you maybe have got to open you mind for some brutal scenes, even though they're all like a very realistic cartoon, because that's what this film is all about, sins and violence, but yet not losing its comic side. Yes the movie doesn't have any color, except for some key objects like a bed, some blood, the 'monster guy' and such, but that just adds to the atmosphere, excellent film!",10,0,1,21 April 2007
Gladiator," Gladiator
","This title does a good job in combining slight story complexity, historical background and action scope. It's been a while since release and time hasn't been tough on quality. The battle at the beginning continues one of the best ever crafted. Sometimes people tend to underestimate the value of drama a film occasionally has to receive not to be deemed shallow. This isn't simply about blood- thirst of the Colosseum crowd, it focus on the relationship between a general and it sking, how this king seems to favor the general instead of his own son to be next Caesar of the great empire of Rome.When the son kills his father and takes on the throne the general is cast out and his family brutally murdered. After a series of events he ends up a gladiator and seeks revenge against the king. Sure the scope is taken to a hole new level for stuff like battle between the two, a king and a gladiator.The general expertise in battle grants him a considerable high status upon so many victories as he climbs his way through. All in all the movie seems accurate in whatever history is left to back it and as entertaining as an action movie that thrives to go beyond simple carnage.",7,1,2,27 January 2015
