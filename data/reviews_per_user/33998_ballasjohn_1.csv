Black Swan," Didn't't turn my head once!
","I went to go see this movie with a few of my friends hearing all the good talk about it. i saw the trailers and TV spots. I thought it was a lame drama for chicks. I was wrong, the movie was amazing, so dark, so interesting. Natalie Portman is a fantastic actress. Mila Kunis was also a spectacular, supporting actress. Every scene was shocking. I may say a few parts of this movie disturbed me. When Natalie was in her room and her legs broke back in the opposite position made me cringe. also when an the women chased after her with her bloody face. it was very good. i went to see it three times. No movie will ever be like this for a very long time i can tell you that much.",Null,0,2,21 January 2011
