Sucker Punch," Inception 2
","if you loved inception there's a strong chance that you'll love sucker punch but if you hated inception you're definitely gonna hate this movie, first of all there's like three different plots in it and it's a bit confusing ,second of all the best word to describe this movie is fresh i don't think you're gonna find another movie with this type of story and plot(not even inception, the similarity between the two is the complexity)but the highlight of the movie is the kick-ass visual effects and awesome cinematography(obviously Zack Snyder's style in directing),when there's action in this movie it's gonna seriously entertain you. there's isn't much to talk about the acting, nothing interesting in that department. to sum up this is definitely an interesting and very awkward motion picture. p.s.:this is not a family movie.",6,9,19,25 March 2011
The Hurt Locker," Boring Yet Interesting
","Ever since the 82nd annual academy awards , when the hurt locker won 6 Oscars including best picture , i was dying to see the film that overthrew avatar(my favorite film of 2009) but after watching the movie i was pretty shocked for i was expecting much much more and i understood why it failed at the box office despite of all its international awards.For starters there was no music whatsoever and in my opinion music is a key element for both the film's beauty and success and this particular picture was in desperate need of some music to keep the viewer interested.Another thing, most of the film's scenes should be enlisted in the Guinness book of records as the most boring scenes in cinema history, it was as if i was watching a documentary about war with no actual combat but the reason behind this is that the film tells the story of a bomb squad and their job doesn't require shooting enemies nevertheless there is one intense scene that will make your body shiver .What's great about this film is its concentration on the effects of war upon soldiers. However, other war films such as platoon made a much better job analyzing this subject making the hurt locker look ridiculous.Despite the negative things i mentioned before the movie has a smart and interesting plot, the cinematography is quite impressive but a bit confusing and as far as acting, Jeremy Renner(the lead actor) gave a powerful performance worthy of an academy award .To sum up, the hurt locker is a movie worth renting but definitely not worth buying and Avatar should have won best picture.",10,0,2,24 August 2010
