Requiem for a Dream," Dream's Nightmare
","Easily the best film of 2000, I finally got to see it, and was left shaken & drained at the end. All my druggie friends are going to get a copy of this one for sure. How was this film so overlooked by society, when drivel like Erin Brokos***s gets so much publicity. To Ellen Burnstyn - you are my favourite, and to director Darren Aronofsky - thank you thank you thank you!",10,0,0,25 May 2001
LÃ©on: The Professional," Eurotrash
","Judging from the French names in the credits, this was not an American production. Euro influence also shows in the misplaced cultural references in the script. An American child in the 1990's imitating Charlie Chaplin or Gene Kelly - give me a break! All those tourist shots of the Manhattan skyline; maybe that sells in Hong Kong, but I'm not buying. I don't understand why this film is rated so highly by IMDB users. It's a standard violent action movie with a bit of Lolita thrown in...nothing wrong with the concept, but really, what's so great about it? Jean Reno is very good, Gary Oldman is annoying as usual, and the kid is just another movie brat. This film faded from memory as soon as the credits were over...barely worth a rental.",1,22,111,18 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," BORING
","This is the most boring movie I have ever suffered through. It's like a 3 hour Sinbad-Hercules-Xena Warrior Princess sword & sorcery adventure - been there, done that many times. Why do directors insist on battle scenes where a few main characters can defeat hundreds of enemies - stupid and monotonous. I have to give this 1 out of 10 just to counter-act all the perfect scores that the geeks have awarded it.",1,1,4,24 December 2001
American History X," Contrived & Predictable
","Oh how original. A bad young neo-nazi goes to prison, has some experiences and mellows out. Oops, too late. Unrealistic dialogue sounds like the movie was written as a warning for school kiddies. And Edward Norton is the prettiest skinhead I've ever seen.",1,8,35,17 February 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Poubelle
","Bleh. What a load of technicolour bull-crap. An overdone-to-death little love story stretched out into a massive production of instantly forgettable song & dance routines. Nicole Kidman is about as sexy as a dead fish wrapped in newspaper and Ewan McGregor's singing left dogs howling outside the cinema. The sets, makeup, and costumes were visually obnoxious, and the music could only be possibly enjoyed by the same type of morons who listen to all '80's radio.",1,39,68,4 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo : You owe me 8 bucks!
","Possibly the worst movie I've seen in a decade... I usually can sense dreck like this before I'm tricked into paying for a ticket, but the rock-climbing preview seemed to promise a cool summer film. It wasn't...the movie consisted of bad acting, inane dialogue, stupid plot, horrid music, annoyingly repetitive explosions and gunfire, actors who aren't half as sexy as they think they are, endless staged-looking car crashes, too many aerial shots of Sydney, and dumb rubber masks being pulled off half the casts' faces. After seeing this & Broken Arrow (starring another lame-actor Scientologist..Travolta), I think John Woo has got to be the most over-rated director out there.",1,0,1,30 May 2000
Gladiator," Maximus entertainment!
","Wow! An action movie that's great to look at, fun, exciting, and has political intrigue to boot. From the opening battle against the barbarians to the Colisseum death matches, the action never disappoints. Ridley Scott tries to spare us some exposure to the extreme violence with quick choppy shots...for which I was grateful. Great performances by all actors, especially the macho,sullen Crowe and a fascinatingly creepy Pheonix. And the wonderful costumes definitely deserve a mention at the next Oscars. Well worth paying full price on the biggest screen in your town.",Null,0,0,1 June 2000
