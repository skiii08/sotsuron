The Avengers," A spectacular spectacular!
","I just got back from the movie theater where I saw The Avengers. Without spoiling anything, I must say it is indeed a spectacular spectacular and I hope to find time to watch it again in the near future. It's an action bonanza laced with fine performances (I love the arguments between Captain America and Iron Man cleverly delivered by Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr.), clever humor and not surprisingly Marvel universe references. Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars. The script was nicely done and the dialogue really reflect the minds of each character. Really, The Avengers is the complete package of entertainment that engaged me with lots of thrills and absolutely no boring moments. I highly recommend it.",9,7,15,25 April 2012
Sucker Punch," I like Sucker Punch!
","After more than a year of waiting, I finally got to watch Sucker Punch and I must say that it definitely is worth the wait.The film is not perfect and obviously there is more style than substance in it. The good thing, however, is that Sucker Punch as a story is pretty much driven by its characters and the performance of their players (kudos to Emily Browning, Oscar Isaac and others) followed closely by the high energy action sequences laced with Zack Snyder's style.From a distance, Sucker Punch looks dumb and hollow but in reality it's got some nice stuff in it. For one thing its presentation took inspiration from comic books, video games, anime and fantasy adventures (mixed with a distorted sense of time), mixed them all in a bag and made the story's core concept of the struggle for freedom a enjoyable ride.The film obviously won't win any awards for acting, but this one still has a strong sense of drama which will remind you that the characters are not paperdolls-for-the-screen but rather believable human beings.With its energetic style, high production values, solid cast and edginess, I find Sucker Punch to be the best women-led action film to date. It's almost like it grabbed Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, So Close and DOA: Dead or Alive by their necks and threw them out the window big time.While it is the queen of women-led action flicks, I don't expect Sucker Punch to win the approval of those who have no little-to-no-interest in the action, fantasy or adventure genres.It is flawed and may not be the cup of tea for many, but I declare Sucker Punch a very solid film to watch if you're open to its concept, performances and style. It also has some new stuff that are worth paying attention to.",8,8,22,25 March 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Spielberg and Lucas are the best adventure makers!
","Now this is where adventure really got exciting and entertaining! Raider of the Lost Ark was the start of a great team-up between Steven Spielberg and George Lucas! Compared to modern action-adventure movies, Raiders has the highest replay value, fun and enjoyment despite its age. Harrison Ford here was superb and he really fit well when it comes to acting and action. Also it's great to see an adventure that took place in the past!With this film's quality of adventure unmatched by any other out there, Raiders is worth watching again and again. Concerning Spielberg and Lucas, I want another Indiana Jones movie as well!",9,0,0,13 November 1999
Unbreakable," One of the best films this year! Shyamalan is the man!
","M. Night Shyamalan delivered greatness in film directing and story telling with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999. This year, he has done it again this time around on a higher level!'Unbreakable' is great story about a man who survived a massive train wreck who later discovers he's unbreakable, or essentially a super human who's only going to know more. Played by Bruce Willis, David Dunn's greatly portrayed with deep acting and a deep sense of discovery and reaction. Samuel L. Jackson, who's the best black actor there is today, play's fragile Elijah Price who's basically the 'breakable' counterpart of Dunn.  Elijah's portrayed to be very knowledgeable, very interesting and very fragile to the viewer.This film reunites Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, and compared to their past team-up, this team-up here is the best I've ever seen involving them. Shyamalan really showed he can bring out the best of the 2 stars and mold it into his story. Oh, Shyamalan himself has a cameo appearance here and it's cool!Simply put, 'Unbreakable' does not have much high-tech gimmicks, special effects, or exagerrations...it simply has one of the best stories ever told on film! There is a twist on the film's end, which I'll not reveal here. Let me just say that the twisting-end here is even better than that of 'The Sixth Sense'.'Unbreakable' is a supernatural story that's so deep, you'll think a lot. The film is not as scary as Shyamalan's other film, but it delivers with more depth and characterization.What to do? Go to the theater's now and watch this movie! It's simply one of the best films this year! My congrats to Mr. Shyamalan!",8,0,0,18 December 2000
Iron Man 2," Good, not great
","Let me say it straight – Iron Man 2 is good, not great. I definitely liked it but nowhere as much as the first film.Specifically, Iron Man 2's plot does not seem that interesting and as such the narrative relied on special effects for impact in certain scenes. No matter how fantastic or bombastic action and effects could get, they just don't help the storytelling very much. The new antagonists – Justin Hammer and Whiplash – are both weak and not compelling. They both pale in comparison to Obadiah Stane (brilliantly played by Jeff Bridges) in terms of personality and antagonism. Don Cheadle as Col. Rhodes/War Machine never felt like he belonged in the film and the more he appeared on screen, the more I wished Terence Howard was back.I also felt that the comedy in this film seemed forced. While the first flick made me laugh or smile, the sequel did not amuse me very much. While Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance as Tony Stark is worth praise, I find it weird that Stark now seemed more psychotica far change from the conflicted man he was before.Aside from Downey's stellar performance, the other big redeeming value was the film's adaptation of character elements from the critically acclaimed Iron Man comic storyline Demon in a Bottle. In that storyline, Stark was portrayed with an addiction to liquor and this concept was nicely portrayed in Iron Man 2. Expect to see Robert Downey, Jr. drink and drink a lot.Having waited two years for Iron Man 2, I felt a bit disappointed. I tried to like the film. It is not a bad movie, but more of a less compelling continuation. The distraction scenes (leading to the Avengers) and the improved action scenes simply could not lift the film's weak story. Adding insult to injury, the final battle with Whiplash is totally unsatisfying to watch.As long as you don't set your expectations very high, Iron Man 2 can be enjoyable. Clearly its presentation is different from the first film, and that made it less enjoyable for me. While you watch Iron Man 2 in the theater, I'll just replay Iron Man on my DVD player.Score: 6.5/10",7,0,3,5 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," More of show than soul.
","The third film of the series unfortunately had less magic in it when compared to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. For instance, there was an obvious drop on both character expression and development along with a huge increase of special effects. The film was more of show than soul most of the time. However, I could not think of a better way for the story to go and maintain the soul The Empire Strikes Back formulated before this film. George Lucas did his best and I accept that. Among the best things I liked here was the Emperor's presence (he is VERY evil), Darth Vader presence until the end, the Ewoks and the special effects. Return of the Jedi's a great film overall, though a step lower from Empire.",6,1,3,27 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The BEST Star Wars in a LONG time! Great movie!
","After suffering from the hype and disappointment of the special FX-dependent Episode I, George Lucas and his Star Wars franchise made a great comeback with Episode II.Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones marks the return of greatness to the franchise plus some new elements added.AOTC is the most emotional movie of the franchise where there are some credible (although a few were not) crying scenes of pain. To be honest, I don't remember a Lucas-directed movie being this expressive and I'm glad George himself presented it.Not only that, we finally got to see the ORIGIN of Darth Vader in young Anakin who was driven by arrogance, rebellion, rage and hatred as seen in the movie. Hayden C. delivered those elements very well and is convincing enough. Natalie Portman's Amidala is much better and more expressive on the screen. Heck, now we've seen how Luke's mother was.Ewan McGregor delivers a good performance in AOTC as Obi-Wan, in fact a major improvement over his The Phantom Menace performance. In the first movie, Ewan is labeled as a guy who does not know acting.  Of course, don't expect a Moulin Rouge-expressive act from him here since this is a fantasy.Christopher Lee, aka Dracula, is remarkable as the count. As for Yoda, this is the best way to present him. We get to see Yoda's TRUE POWER and wisdom for the first time ever, and there was not a single moment wherein I did not believe in him. True, because of his size, he looks funny to the audience when he was about to fight with a lightsaber but in the end he is a convincing Jedi master and lightsaber user.On the technical side of things, Lucasfilm really made a lot of effort to make the film production great. The special effects from ILM, as expected, are groundbreaking. The sets, costume designs, and other things are all graded A.The story is very well presented and easily the best since The Empire Strikes Back. We see a very nice presentation of the Anakin-Amidala love story, Obi-Wan's missions, Anakin's 'new' family, the big battle, etc. George Lucas wrote the story with Star Wars fans in mind, and as a result fans get to see everything related, not alien, in the Star Wars universe. As for those of you who suffered from TPM, don't worry...this movie is NOT CHILDISH like that one.The movie is very replayable and I'm already looking to watching it again in the theaters. Not only that, I'm already looking towards the DVD of AOTC!Overall, Star Wars: AOTC is the best film I've seen for the year! As a movie buff, I must admit that I enjoyed this movie BETTER than A New Hope, Return of the Jedi and TPM. Only Empire Strikes Back stands taller than this one.The greatness is BACK, everyone! Star Wars is right on track and I hope that George Lucas can deliver a slamming conclusion with Episode III. I'm already looking towards 2005. :)",10,0,0,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring...the King of the Fantasies.
","I will be very honest here.Star Wars is NO LONGER the supreme fantasy movie franchise. LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring INSTANTLY KILLS any Star Wars movie for that honor hands down and no questions asked.The Fellowship has an extremely high level of quality and excellence. Never have I seen a fantasy epic that featured a perfect-cast, very deep character development, excellent pacing, excellent special effects and best of all, an excellent story that was perfectly translated from Tolkien's books.Right from the beginning of the film, which details the history of the Ring, I was blown away by a wave of cinematic excellence.As far as fantasies go, The Fellowship has a perfect cast and each character is excellently cast, like Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf, VM as Strider/Aragorn, Liv Tyler as Arwen...etc. Heck, by seeing them onscreen I don't think of the actors but more about their characters...it comes to show that the stars instantly vanished to transform into the famous characters many people know worldwide.LOTR: The Fellowship is nothing less than excellent as a fantasy...and as a movie in general. I highly recommend to EVERYONE to see this film and I promise you...forgetting about Star Wars is worth it as long as there is LOTR.A lot has changed when I saw this movie. I never knew Peter Jackson before LOTR but now I greatly respect him as a master of fantasy and story detail...I am not afraid to say that Mr. Star Wars himself, George Lucas, has finally met someone who has BEATEN HIM to the punch.
By comparison, Lucas is responsible for the decline of fantasy entertainment value of Star Wars since he made The Phantom Menace, and no, Attack of the Clones is not enough to entertain me. Perhaps he should try hiring Peter Jackson for Episode III...Sorry Star Wars, I am sticking with LOTR. My salute to Tolkien and Jackson!!!",10,1,1,11 January 2003
American Beauty," Pure filming excellence!
","American Beauty is one-hundred percent pure filming excellence in quality! It has a story that really is one of a kind, has a great cast and it explores some of the things we overlook in today's world. For the cast, Kevin Spacey's got excellent delivery of his character ranging from a worn-out father then into a teen-age personality of his own. Annette Bening is the most beautiful woman to see in the film, and in equal to her beauty is the greatness of her acting. In fact, Annette's act here is the best I've ever seen in her! No doubt, she's the American Beauty here...in looks and in act! The story of this film is truly an original! It's so creative and expressive at the same time, and this leads to this film's incredible detail! The 'Bill & Monica' love story in real-life has a big influence in the story if you're wondering.No doubt about it! American Beauty is probably the best BEST PICTURE winner I've ever seen! Better watch this on the theaters or go get a DVD or VHS of this film! Excellent is the way to describe this movie!",10,0,0,16 May 2000
Collateral," Tom Cruise + Michael Mann= GREAT FILM! One of 2004's best!
","I entered the theater having huge expectations with Collateral. Not only does it have superstar Tom Cruise (M:I-2, Last Samurai, Minority Report) but it also has director Michael Mann (one of the BEST directors around) whose credits included Heat and Ali.And after spending over two hours watching, I must say that Collateral is one great movie!Tom Cruise is hit-man Vincent. Already very experienced in his underworld duties, Vincent is the hit-man who really knows what to do, what to anticipate and motivate people. Heck, Vincent even has humanity him especially when he actually helped Max (Jamie Fox) out of trouble.True to hit-man fashion, Cruise delivered GREAT moves with his fists, kicks and guns. Having seen him use guns in John Woo's M:I-2, Cruise played with the guns very differently and realistically in this movie. Performance wise, Vincent is greatly played by Cruise with such elements of being a hit-man and a human being. I wish Cruise good luck to winning his first ever acting Oscar.Jamie Fox plays Max, the taxi driver who works hard for his living. His bad luck started when he met Vincent and everything changed for the worst. Max is very human in the sense that he gets torn apart between aiding Vincent, interacting with his mom and even helping a young woman he met only hours ago. Jamie Fox deserves big credit for his role and I can't think of anyone else playing Max effectively.Director Michael Mann is back to what he does best with the police/criminal/assassin genre of films. Like Heat and Manhunter, the lead characters are actually very lonely guys (Vincent Hanna and Neal M anyone?), there's also a huge shootout (Collateral's shootout is shorter but solid enough compared to Heat's bank heist), guns galore, people getting killed, lots of talk, etc. Not only did Mann do what he does best, his film has very good editing, lively camera angles, and best of all he delivered the plot and characters to life. Thanks to Mann, Collateral is very convincing and such a story can actually happen in real life.Conclusion: Collateral is one of 2004's BEST FILMS! Whether you go for Cruise, Mann, Fox, action, drama, suspense and all others kind of stuff, Collateral has something to entertain and inform any kind of moviegoer.This movie is a MUST SEE! I rate it a 9 out of 10!Now for the future of Collateral: DVD! Could hardly wait!",9,0,0,6 August 2004
Aliens," Aliens is a classic!
","I watched once again Aliens and even though the film is over 25-years- old, it still is a GREAT film to watch all thanks to James Cameron and his team. The film is not just a sequel to the 1979 film by Ridley Scott but also a reflective story as well. Think about it. Cameron stated that the Vietnam War was an influence on Aliens not just with the presence of soldiers but also with Ripley agreeing to go back to the world where her crew (who died one by one) visited and discovered a place of many alien eggs. Ripley's role as an observer parallels the acts of some real life Vietnam War veterans who, despite their nightmarish experiences during the war, returned to Vietnam in a totally different manner.As for why Aliens stands out nicely among other action films of the 1980s...it is SUBVERSIVE of the cinematic trends of the decade.Think about it. In Aliens, there were these highly trained and brave soldiers who easily symbolized the Gung-Ho militarism culture of 1980s action cinema. Like Rambo, these soldiers were macho and had deadly firepower with them. Yet in the film, you see that they were helpless when they encountered the aliens. Behind it all, Cameron inserted a strong mother-and-daughter relationship between Ripley and the young girl Newt. While she was lost in space, Ripley lost her daughter to old age. Newt lost her parents to aliens. Of course, none of Ripley's scenes would have happened without the incredible dramatic performances from Sigourney Weaver who truly deserved her Oscar nomination in this film. From a survivor to a mother and a fighter, Sigourney Weaver is excellent.Finally, the film's aliens (xenomorphs) are very well done even though a different creative team worked on it. It's great to see how James Cameron and his team came up with clever ways to present the aliens as numerous despite their limited resources. A lot of research was done and special attention to detail was made too. Overall, Aliens is a classic!",10,1,3,16 June 2012
Quantum of Solace," Quantum's good enough and unique to watch
","After two years of waiting, I finally watched Quantum of Solace expecting another unforgettable adventure as well as another great 007 performance from Daniel Craig (the best Bond since Connery).I am surprised somewhat with the way the film turned out. As the 22nd Bond film, this one takes a noticeable departure from the trends that defined the franchise. Gadgets are nowhere, no Miss Moneypenny, the James Bond theme only plays with the end credits, and no 'Bond, James Bond'.Fortunately, the departure led to a unique kind of story for Bond. While past films featured the agent fighting megalomaniacs, Quantum puts Bond into the middle of big mess in the intelligence community. Not only that, Bond is struggling with the loss of Vesper, thus hurting himself emotionally. He gets suspected of taking things personally when he's supposed to do his assignments professionally. Luckily, Daniel Craig delivered a very human portrayal of Bond that few could imagine.Quantum has lots of action and stunts, but I must admit I was bothered with the MTV-style editing (too fast and dizzying) and I was annoyed with how the action scenes mimicked the style of the recent Jason Bourne flicks. Is this Bourne or Bond?! You watch and decide! The story does have some originality in it. Let's face the fact that in the global economy, nations compete with each other for foreign investments. That aspect is pushed to the extreme in the film with Greene's scheme and deal with Bolivia. True enough, some governments out there make deals with these kinds of 'investors' even if it would mean danger. The bargaining, selling and functioning of such deals each have risks to both the investor and the authority. More importantly, such deals complicate matters in the international intelligence community, and in this film it causes division between and within state intelligence. Come to think of it, the last time I saw deep intelligence politics as far as the Bond movies go was in 1963's From Russia With Love.Overall, Quantum of Solace is a worthy sequel. It does not really try to outdo Casino Royale, but then again it does not need to. For one thing, Bond himself still has a lot to dig and dig within MI6. The Quantum organization is the 21st century's answer to SPECTRE of the past, and there is no denying that MI6 now has a real problem to watch out for. True enough, a new espionage war is brewing and Bond must do what he can for Queen and Country.Score: 8 out of 10",8,3,7,8 November 2008
Saving Private Ryan," No equal in war!
","The most realistic WWII movie ever is the best war movie ever made! Steven Spielberg has shown us once again why he's born to be a director. With Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg showed us all why 'war is hell'. Watch it and you'll always remember how great this film is!",10,0,0,5 September 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A huge disappointment!
","There is no doubt that Steven Spielberg has slipped upon his return. With Schindler's List, he was simply the best. This film is his comeback movie, and it really disappoints me to the heart...plus this is where I started having doubts about Steven's credibility.I've read the novel a year before this film came out. The translation from book to film is horrible, and this is a loser in the game of entertainment. We have Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Harding (played by Julianne Moore) on their story return, but they simply don't fit well with the story.Storywise, this film is better off as a spin-off than a sequel. The Lost World is simply 'more of everything' from Jurassic Park and a little new touch. Anyone who did not read the book would like this film, but then again there would be some who won't like it.Steven Spielberg's directing here feels weak and generic. In fact, there are other directors out there who can direct this film and even improve on it. Spielberg, who's known for his artistic direction (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List, Jaws, etc.), really disappointed me here. I expected better from him.I feel cheated by this film, and cheated by Spielberg. It seemed that this film was made only to squeeze out money from viewers, who would simply pay to see dinosaurs. The plot is very bad, the cast is not good, the special FX are better, and there simply is very little enjoyment with this film.Better not pay a high price to watch this movie. You'll be amazed with the dinosaurs but you'll notice just how bad the plot is, how bad the cast is and how little value you can get from The Lost World. You'll be disappointed eventually.",1,17,50,15 September 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The World's Best Movie Of 2000!!!
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is the best movie I've seen in the theaters this year! The film's production is incredible and despite the reported $12.5 million figure for the budget, the film looked like a $70 million production! Just look at the number of extras used, the sets, the costumes, the locations (China is a very beautiful country!) the stunts, and the list goes on!To stress out why the film is the best! The cast is virtually perfect! Chow Yun-Fat, who's more known with those gun man roles, is simply the best to play Li Mu Bai. Chow's calm, combined with the character's wisdom, showed that the role was like it was made for him. Michelle Yeoh's acting adds maturity to the story, and as great as she performs martial arts, she acts great! Ziyi Zhang is easily one of the most promising young actresses in the world, and you'll see why. The supporting cast is very great too! Pei-Pei Cheng's Jade Fox is very expressive, very wise and it gives the film a strong presence of 'opposition'. The martial arts scenes are perfect! Woo-ping Yuen, who choreographed the martial arts scenes in the usually over-rated 'The Matrix', worked harder and better in this film. As far as martial arts go, Crouching Tiger is easily the best of them all not just because of the amount of action, not just because of the kind of styles used, but because Woo-ping dedicated a lot of research and heart. The result is a martial arts fest that connects itself with character expression and story flow. And if you think 'The Matrix' is the greatest martial arts fest, you're very wrong! Crouching Tiger easily destroys 'The Matrix' into a billion pieces! As if that's not enough, Crouching Tiger's story and character development is so deep it renders 'The Matrix' obsolete and worthless.Acting and action speaking, Crouching Tiger never failed me. Like the tradition of Chinese epics, we see the stars act and perform the action themselves! If you thought Chow Yun-Fat's only good with guns, you'll be shocked to see how he performs martials arts here. Even Pei-Pei Cheng, an old chubby lady, would shock you with her moves. Cheng showed that even women in her age and build can move fast and fight with greatness! Michelle Yeoh still fights as great as she did when she was young. As for Ziyi Zhang, she makes a great martial artist!Heck, if you put Keanu Reeves up against any of the above mentioned stars (or anyone in the film), he would either chicken out or easily be defeated!Ang Lee's direction reminds me a bit of Irvin Kershner's work in 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Aside from the use of fight scenes and some special effects, Lee brought out a lot of expression and drama from the characters to the point where the viewer sees everyone here in a high level of being human.
Crouching Tiger's story is one of a kind. A great sword gets stolen, then the story pushes on with unmatched expression, very nice twists, characters express a lot of themselves, viewers get to learn some very valuable lessons and morales, and the story ends with one of the most unique endings I've ever seen in any movie!Use of music is done greatly, and it perfectly fits the mood and what goes on. CoCo Lee's theme song 'A Love Before Time' is the best movie song I've heard in a long time. I feel it should be nominated for the next Oscars, and that goes the same with the musical scoring.Now that I've seen this film in the theaters, I now look towards the upcoming DVD version. And to those of you who read this review, I highly-recommend watching this. You'll be amazed and entertained with greatness! This is the Year of the Dragon, and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is simply the best movie in the world today!",10,0,0,1 November 2000
The Bourne Legacy," Good, not great.
","What can I say about the film? It is good, not great. It's another Bourne film without the presence of Jason Bourne/Matt Damon.Without spoiling the plot, the movie is in essence a talky movie about an agent who had been dependent on 'meds' and finds himself struggling just as the 'programs' start shutting down. Compared to the previous three Bourne films, The Bourne Legacy had more dialogue (which could burn you out) and less action.Surprisingly, Jeremy Renner does make a good action star and you can see more talent from him. Really, his appearance as Hawkeye in The Avengers was just a small preview of what he can do. His character Aaron Cross was arguably shallow but was saved by Renner.Oscar winner Rachel Weisz plays the supporting role Dr. Marta Shearing but in a big way in terms of screen time. Compared to other action flicks that have female supporting roles, Weisz has a bigger on-screen presence and added some importance to the plot.And there was also Edward Norton whose sheer talent made up for the lack of depth of his agency executive. Norton makes a good executive who is brash, tough and demanding. Since this movie had an excessive amount of dialogue, I should say that the motorcycle chase scene that was filmed in the Philippines was the closest thing the film had to an action highlight. For me, the Philippine motorcycle chase was a nice reliever (from the lengthy talk) and added some much needed speed to the film's pacing just enough to save it from being a total bore.It's kinda hard to recommend The Bourne Legacy to everyone. If you are the type of viewer who is obsessed with the Bourne franchise, be it the books or the films, then this movie just might prove to be good. If you cannot handle a Matt Damon-less Bourne film at all, skip this.",6,2,7,13 August 2012
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight is a masterpiece!
","After 3 long years of waiting, I saw The Dark Knight and left the theater amazed and awed. This film, filled with realism, maturity and incredible performance, is not just a sequel but a masterpiece in film-making! The Dark Knight shows a Gotham City with escalated crime led by the Joker, who is graced with the amazing performance of the late Heath Ledger (he's truly one-of-a-kind). Because of this, law enforcement has been pretty busy and fortunately it has Batman and district attorney Harvey Dent leading the fight. As the film moves on, the plot gets much, much deeper with story twists and surprises that you must see.Character development is astonishing, in fact The Dark Knight scores multiple gold medals on this field. Graced by the talented Christian Bale, we see Bruce Wayne getting more concerned than ever on state of the city's society. He acknowledges that being Batman may not be enough to completely eradicate crime and that only local authorities have the resources to fight on the long term. This is the reason why he feels that Dent, who is doing a great job, should be the face of justice. Dent however has some character flaws like playing by chance (with his flipping coin) and controlling his emotions. His transformation into Two Face will make you realize those flaws.The Joker is a madman in every sense of the word. For him, society needs to 'loosen up' and in his view having a society led by a powerful justice system is very much like fascism. He is the anarchist and easily the complete opposite of Batman. While Batman and the Joker represent extreme ends, you will notice that the people in the middle suffer a lot and this is the whole point of the film.If Batman Begins' theme is the conflict between vengeance and justice, The Dark Knight is about justice and corruption, and order and chaos. It is a fact that the people we look up to commit acts of corruption just to get their jobs done or to satisfy themselves in return of service. Along the way, someone starts a rampage of disorder to intimidate both the people and their authorities. Batman and the new commissioner Gordon are both incorruptible, while Dent, despite his achievements, is not. The Joker complicate matters by turning Gotham upside down.The film's cast is excellent, in fact I give it an A+ for its grade. Maggie G. does make a nice replacement as Rachel D., but I'll bet you will miss Katie H. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine add depth to the Wayne portion of the story. The production values are very high (boombastic action scenes, great locations and balanced use of CGI) and director Christopher Nolan deserves praise for crafting what is probably the best comic book movie ever.Overall, The Dark Knight is a masterpiece. I highly-recommend this film to everyone.Visit Sharkey's Pool http://sharkey360.blogspot.com",10,1,3,19 July 2008
Pulp Fiction," Incredible!
","I must say that Pulp Fiction caught me totally surprised with its artistic story telling and dialogue. Quentin Tarantino is the factor behind this and the cast are perfect for the story. John Travolta's performance here is probably the best I've ever seen from him and his dance here is the greatest he performed. Pulp Fiction requires quiet a bit of thinking to endure the story, because if you're the type who only likes special effects or who does not think and listen, you'll easily get turned off. Understanding what you hear and see here is the key and I recommend this film to anyone who can. Don't listen to those pro-life supporters, anti-violence supporters, special-effects-lovers...go watch this film!",10,0,0,6 January 2000
Jaws," Still the best creature feature
","It's been over 2 decades since this movie first hit Hollywood's waves on the beach. Steven Spielberg in this film proved that water can really get scary, especially on the beach...this reflected what happened to several beaches worldwide after Jaws' release. Despite the fact that the shark's teeth looked fake, the fear and intensity was still around whenever the shark was around. For Jaws as a series of films, this is the only movie worth watching. Before going to the beach, watch this film first. Who knows? The water could really unsafe the least you know it.",10,1,2,17 November 1999
Scream," Horror goes forward at long last
","I got so used to many other weak horror films, Scream actually shocked me with it's incredible story telling, natural characters (though the 'guilty' is unnatural), and of course, the many scary moments and jumps. Scream is a work of art, and it's the kind that should lead the way for modern horror movies in America. Scream is so unique, it deserves more attention. Go watch this one!",10,0,0,25 September 1999
Prometheus," Enjoyable
","It may not be perfect but Prometheus still is an engaging sci-fi flick that comes with a mix of mystery, science, horror and some notable solid performances. Director Ridley Scott tells a story that dealt with the search for answers regarding the origin of humanity and similar to his 1979 classic Alien, Prometheus has a star ship and a crew with a mission. At the same time, the famed director made great use of the technology and with his technical team delivering great cinematography, striking effects and most of all a great sense of immersion into the story.The first half of the film had a strong sci-fi exploration flavor in it laced with mystery. In the second half, the tone changes into suspense, horror and shock all delivered in a fine pace. Along the way, there are lots of elements that connect Prometheus with Alien and for sure the nerds or the more observant moviegoers will have a blast connecting the dots. The casting is a mixed bag although it is somewhat justified by the time the film ends. Sure there were crew members who are pretty shallow and not worth caring for. Of course, the more notable roles such as David (Michael Fassbender), protagonist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) somewhat made up for the lack of depth from the others.Noomi Rapace delivered a fine performance as a strong-willed woman who not only searched for answers but also came up with the courage to survive against tremendous odds ala Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in Alien. Charlize Theron is excellent as the beautiful but very cold-hearted Meredith Vickers, and for the most part her presence attracted a feeling of animosity from the viewers. Still, there is also that feeling that before you want to get rid of Vickers, you also would want to know what she knows, what she is after and more. Michael Fassbender, in my view, stole the show as the android David. He is no copycat of Ash (Alien) or Bishop (Aliens) but rather he stands out as an android that not only tirelessly works to accomplish his goals but also learn about humanity as well as the search for answers on the galactic level. Quite symbolically, David is very much like a living, walking version of HAL (2001: A Space Odyssey) as well as a more sophisticated version of Star Trek: TNG's Data. Will Prometheus end up as a timeless classic like Alien? That is something we won't find out until decades to come. No box office numbers or any wave of media reviews will be able to justify that because clearly only time will tell if Prometheus will be remembered whether as an indirect prequel to Alien or as its own sci-fi story. In my honest opinion, Prometheus is a very solid sci-fi flick on its own and definitely it is one of Ridley Scott's best films in a long time.",8,5,8,6 June 2012
Signs," Gibson + Schyamalan= GREAT MOVIE
","Signs is another winning film from M. Night Schyamalan, one of the leading Asian directors in Hollywood today. Schyamalan, who already had a unique talent in film story telling since he was very young, once again has shown that very talent and strike gold in Hollywood with Signs.As a film, Signs is a very itriguing and very detailed suspense thriller story that has a good mix of sci-fi and horror elements. Signs takes a very close look at the 'crop cycles' phenomenon of UFOs, a particular matter that had lacked attention in movies since most UFO movies prefer to look at the 'abduction' scenario.As a Schyamalan film, I find Signs the best since the 1999 classic The Sixth Sense. There are many things about this movie that struck hard with attention and at the same time left me something to remember for a long time.Signs is also a great vehicle to have superstar Mel Gibson work together with the super talented Schyamalan. They both benefit each other's work ethics and at the same time add depth to the movie. Mel's acting is very good and has presented his character very well.Joaquin Phoenix is also good in this movie and complements well in the movie playing Gibson's brother. The 2 kids are also good.Schyamalan's style of filmmaking is of golden quality as usual, such as reflections on TV screens, suspense buildup and scary visuals. I also enjoyed seeing his cameo appearance in Signs, and despite being a known filmmaker, NOBODY in the movie theater here in the Philippines knew that the man they saw on screen is the director himself.Signs is a great movie and now I'm already waiting for the upcoming DVD release which I will surely go for!EXCELLENT MOVIE!",10,0,2,31 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," A GREAT comic-based movie sequel!
","Being one of the first people around the world to see X2 in the theaters, I left the movie house this afternoon HIGHLY IMPRESSED.X2, or 'X-Men 2' as the way it is branded here in the Philippines, is truly a GREAT sequel especially for the comic-based movie genre. For movies in general, X2 is also an impressive sequel.What makes X2 great? For the most part, the story is the main factor of the greatness. Being a comic collector years ago, my expectations and demand for quality story making in X-Men has always been high and the great thing is that this sequel's story is very well made.Unlike the first X-Men, X2 is presented with a more matured toned and the story always makes sense concentrating on the conflict between humans and mutants. The characters are also very well presented in delivering the atmosphere of the X-Men universe and this time around the relationship between Professor X and Magneto has been explored even deeper thus blurring the boundary between good and evil. Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine has IMPROVED this time around and the same goes with Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique. But most notable among all is Sir Ian McKellen's portrayal of Magneto which is much better this time around (I guess playing the wise Gandalf really helped him). Patrick Stewart continues to bring quality performance as Prof X.The biggest new addition to the cast, who also has a very impressive performance, is Brian Cox as the obsessed William Stryker who will stop at nothing to wipe out all mutants.Any flaws? The cast, while generall very good, does have MISCASTS. James Marsden is STILL TERRIBLE and STILL IMMATURED as Cyclops/Scot Summers while Famkke Jansen is TOO OLD and UNAPPEALING as Jean Grey.In my own opinion, Cyclops and Jean Grey should be played by actors who live up to each character's maturity and appeal. With the fact that Marsden is 9 years younger than Jansen in reality, their age gap is very present in the story.Aside from having a great story and strong cast, X2 also has some of the best action scenes in film yet this 2003 not to mention some of the most impressive special effects works. With the way the film ended, I was left impressed and satisfied plus I am already looking towards the next X-Men movie. If the film crew follows the way X2 ended as far as story telling goes, I am optimistic that they will explore the Jean Grey-Phoenix storyline that was legendary in the comic books (I just hope that Marsden and Jansen get REPLACED).X2's rating for me: 9 out of 10. Definitely HIGHLY RECOMMENDED VIEWING!",9,0,0,30 April 2003
Munich," Spielberg's best since Schindler's List
","Munich is undoubtedly Steven Spielberg's best film since Schindler's List. In today's world of international terrorism, Munich is highly relevant and it deeply explores the conflict between country, duty, family and humanity. Told mainly through the view of Avner (Eric Bana), you can see just how difficult and disturbing waging a war against selected enemies can be. Leaving your family to perform a duty for country is already a hard task to swallow, while executing team strategies against the enemy adds even more danger and hardship.Spielberg's directing in this movie is very striking and artistic, which not only exposes the most relevant elements of Munich but it also delivers deep impact to your conscience. That's right, Spielberg's impact is too powerful to ignore and your conscience will tingle a lot. Truly Spielberg is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) and he stands high and right beside the legends of Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Lino Brocka.",10,2,3,12 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best in the history of film sequels!
","I liked this film a lot over other movie sequels, and among the Star Wars films this one is the second best to The Phantom Menace. With a huge success like A New Hope, making a sequel worthy to it was very tough...unless the makers put their mind to it...and they did. George Lucas did not direct this and he found a great direct with Irvin K. who made this film more human in nature than the first film. In fact, character expression here is the best and so is the character development...both the best in the series. You get to see just how natural the relationship of Leia and Han develop, you get to see more emotion, feel pain (like when Han got tortured or when Luke learned who Darth Vader is), and so much more. This film is definitely worth striking back for! Go for it!",10,0,0,27 December 1999
Windtalkers," John Woo does it again with greatness! Cage's act is his best in years!
","WINDTALKERS is a World War II movie that takes a close look on why the US forces won the Pacific...the Navajos and their code. Along with them came John Woo's style of story telling, namely human relationships between characters ala 1989's THE KILLER.Nicolas Cage plays Joe Enders who is assigned to protect the force's Navajo codetalkers but most of all, protect the code at ALL COSTS. Adam Beach plays Yahzee whom Enders is assigned to, and with his part you can see the Navajo culture. Christian Slater, who expectedly did not have that much screen time as one might think, plays the friendly soldier Ox who is assigned to another Navajo named Whitehorse.Cage's performance in this movie is nothing less than excellent, in fact I believe it's his best performance since his award-winning role in 1995's LEAVING LAS VEGAS. Enders is traumatized in the beginning, has personal clashes, suffers from his left ear, and tried so hard to relate with others before finally realizing his mission and its value. Cage also showed A LOT of emotion throughout the movie.The Navajos were well portrayed. Not only did they have to leave their homeland and families to train and fight, they also had to deal with the realities of war, war horror and even discrimination in their own army. The movie showed that Navajos truly deserved honor right in the beginning, and they had to wait over 55 years for it. Another thing here...you can really feel the pain Navajos get when they're discriminated or snubbed or used.John Woo's directing in this movie is rather different from his other movies. Don't expect any 2-fisted gunplay here, don't expect any of his action gimmicks but the one thing you should expect is the way he directs his characters...through human relations. Just like the classic THE KILLER, Windtalkers showed deep character development between Enders and Yahzee. While The Killer showed the boundary between an assassin and a cop gets erased, the boundary between the white man and the Navajo also gets cleared off leading to one major cause to fight and stand for in the war.There are several slow motion scenes here as well, although I do find them shorter played and seemed to run kinda faster than those in old movies. As for the violence, expect A LOT of bombing, firing, killing and other elements of destruction to fill the screen. It is John Woo's most violent film since his Hong Kong movies, but they are not as graphic as that of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's not a bad thing though because the violence on-screen is very well worth watching. Woo surprised me with the fact that he is truly CAPABLE of directing a war movie. He can really direct thousands of extras to run forward with all those explosions and still make it look realistic and convincing. Woo is indeed not limited to the 'lone action hero' style of screenplays with this movie, and aside from violence he can really bring out the act and emotions from his characters.In concluding this, I give TWO-THUMBS UP for Woo's direction, the expressive cast and the story. WINDTALKERS is one of the best movies I've seen this year and it easily kills the earlier war movies like HART'S WAR, BEHIND ENEMY LINES and WE ARE SOLDIERS.WINDTALKERS is not SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but it sure sits up there beside it. Easily one of the best war movies ever made.Salute to Woo, the stars and the Navajos!",6,5,11,2 August 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," As great as Raiders
","The third film of the series is virtually as great and as entertaining as Raider of the Lost Ark. We get to see Indy on a 'quest' to find the Holy Grail, which is even rarer than the Ark of Covenant and the Ankara Stones. In fact, this one is Indy's most challenging adventure yet. To add more greatness to the cast, we get to meet Indy's father Henry Jones Sr. (played by Sean Connery of James Bond-fame). Seeing Harrison Ford and Sean Connery as father and son gave me that 'James Bond is Indy's father' kind of feeling.The film's action scenes are great to watch! Spielberg's directing formulated the action to a higher level than that of the Temple of Doom. In fact, I find the action here the most exciting yet. Overall, The Last Crusade is one of the best movies ever made with action and adventure. It's right beside Raiders of the Lost Ark on top.",8,4,7,1 January 2000
