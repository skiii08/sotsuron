The New World," I want to see the LONG version
","I actually haven't seen the film yet, but have been anxiously waiting to see it for 6 months as its release got pushed. Unfortunately it made its original New York run while I was out of town for the holidays and was GONE much to my dismay the day I got back. I am very upset that I have to wait for the DVD to see the LONG version. I happen to like films with well developed expositions, even if the current fast food culture has no patience for them. I wish there was a choice...maybe one long version showing at specific theaters for those who want that option. Do you hear me out there producer/distributors...some of us want the whole portion! not the short shrift.",Null,2,4,20 January 2006
