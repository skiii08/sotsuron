The Blair Witch Project," Waste of Time
","I saw this film long after the hype was over. If it hadn't been for the jumpy photography, I would have fallen asleep. No discernable plot, gratuitous profanity - which added absolutely nothing to the film - and poorly acted.I know they're making a sequel, but I have to ask why? I think I'll wait for it to come out on video - then spend the time reading a book. My rating was 2.",2,0,2,16 September 2000
Marie Antoinette," Fails on So Many Levels
","First, I want to say that I really like historical dramas. This leads me to a bias, however. A good historical drama needs the feel of the period it represents.Marie Antoinette completely fails at this. Costumes were good, but there was no real feel of the excesses of the French court that led to its downfall. The score was - in my opinion - an unmitigated disaster. It didn't know what it was trying to be. Ranging from anachronistically modern to occasional strains that *MIGHT* have been intended for a past period, it detracted rather than enhanced the experience.Ms. Dunst is a good actress - but she wasn't allowed to show it here. She looked like she was sleep-walking through the film.Not surprisingly, it took great liberties with history. Certainly not unusual in such a piece, but the inaccuracies seemed to be based in an attempt to show Louix XVI in a poor light. The sad part is that he *WAS* a poor king. It would have been better to properly portray him.I give it a 3 out of 10.",3,1,2,21 March 2008
