Ghost," I just couldn't see what the hype was all about
","Okay, so we had the late Patrick Swayze here in his prime and Demi Moore in the beginning of hers. And not to mention the incredibly unfunny Whoopi Goldberg thrown in as a token element in the mix.Now I'm not saying I am being heartless in a review of a film countless number of people loved and adored, it's just I can't understand what the hype was or the romantic meaning of the storyline was. My ex-wife loved it, but I saw nothing remotely interesting that would catch my attention.My reasoning behind the 4 out of 10 star rating is for the soundtrack and not-too-shabby acting, although Demi Moore looks like she was so attention-starved it was almost too funny. Yet I'll leave this Ghost for all the Casper lovers out there because that is the only Ghost I believe in.",2,1,4,4 June 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," One brilliant biopic...
","...and very powerfully made!I grew up listening to Queen in the 1970s, and from the start of the film, I was very impressed with his much Freddie Mercury's life was so complex and eccentric. The movie itself could play as as rock opera, but not in the caliber of Tommy (1975) or Gimme Shelter (1970). The acting is well-performed, as if you were right there in the band's presence. I really enjoyed it and could watch it again...it was that surreal and spot on with the songs, even if they did incorporate Queen's actual vocals and music in it.Highly recommended - a must-see twice or three times to feel the storm of the music and how Mercury lived his life, with and without the band.'s presence.",10,3,4,15 December 2018
We're the Millers," Now THIS is comedy!
","Although it is slow in parts and seems to drag, it picks right back up with a one-two punch to the gut and will leave the hardest person just bust out in a hard-core fit of laughter. Did me!So here we have a good-hearted drug dealer who has cheated his dealer and to get the dealer the money back, he must get a load of high-octane marijuana from Mexico to him. Problem is, the marijuana will be stolen as well.Not wanting to travel alone, our lucky dealer seeks the help from a stripper, a complete doofus of a neighbor, and a stteet-smart kid...all to pose as his family to not look so conspicuous.Then the fun starts......watch the movie, it's well worth the time if you like stupid humor like me. I actually liked this movie so much I bought it on DVD.You won't be disappointed.",9,1,2,2 May 2019
Get Out," Trash!
","This had to be the worst movie I had ever seen in the last 15 years.It appears this appealed mostly to the African-American audience in attendance while I was there because every time a Caucasian character was either injured or killed, the whole theatre broke out in cheers and doing the Arsenio Hall arm wave. Totally disgusting and uncalled for.I have nothing good to say about this movie despite the others here who raved about it. Plot made little sense and I just put this movie in with the cobwebs of movies I never want to see ever again.Get Out made me want to get out - it was that awful and very racially insensitive.",1,13,21,8 August 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," I've watched this countlessly...
","...even read the Sentinel a few times, and I still can't figure it out.By far this ranks as #2 of my all-time favorite movies, it still resonates superiority in filmmaking; Kubrick had extreme vision, although there may have been differences with Arthur C. Clarke behind the storyline. Even in 1968, some technologies did come to pass in our own 2001. There's just something about the film that keeps you interested and intrigued if you like the sci-fi and suspense genre. I like to think of the story as man vs. machine conflict, like who would win the battle of the fittest...which in turn leads to the question of if man created the machine, would not both destroy themselves if they were to error?And that's where I get lost. I'm going to watch this yet again to see if I can reason with myself to see if I can make deeper sense of it all...and because I love this movie.A no-questions-asked 10/10 in my books. It will never get old.",10,2,5,6 May 2019
Rocky," One of the best...
","..sports movies out there, but it was good enough to rank #3 of my top five in that category.Like many of the reviews here say, Rocky is not a boxing movie, and I agree with that. I saw a movie about opportunity, about being an unknown becoming known. There were parts I did not care for, like Paulie incessantly breaking Adrian down. Not called for, but people said it the character's drinking problem that caused his rants and rages. Fine. Yet the movie itself makes you want to cheer for the underdog by being right there ringside. From start to finish, it's an awesome movie with an awesome score with awesome acting.Packs a mean upper cut. Very excellent movie indeed.",10,0,0,3 May 2019
Downfall," Strong and intense!!
","I have seen many films about both world wars, some were good and some bad...but Downfall seems to me, in my opinion, the most intense, deepest, and strongest movie about the demise of Hitler and the end of the European theatre.Bruno Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler as if he were Hitler himself. The gestures, mannerisms, even the look would literally give an intense fright to anyone if he walked into a room where no one knew who Ganz was. So much of the story follows the real story of life in the bunker, in and around Berlin, April 1945. The film grips you with clutches of paranoia, fear, and the unknown. It is truly one of those movies that you have to truly appreciate history to understand the complexity of Germany at the final end. It is not an ordinary 'ding dong the FÃ¼hrer's dead' movie; it's a compelling and to-the-point one you never want to get up and go pee kind.Very sharp, deep, and intense. Definitely a buy and keep for any military or history nostalgia buff.",10,3,3,24 April 2019
Casino," Uncomparable
","I really didn't watch many mob movies except for the Godfather trilogy, Once Upon a Time in America, and Goodfellas...then in 1995, along came a Scorsese classic I found deep, intense, and very well told...Casino.The best parts of this movie hit you right at the moment when you least expect it. DeNiro and Pesci again make a dynamic duo here. One of the greatest assets in my opinion was getting to see plenty of Sharon Stone's gorgeous legs. The whole main cast was above and beyond...plus being an Alan King fan, this made the movie a plus to me.However, there are some senses that I felt should never been in the movie, but being by Nicholas Pileggi's book, they were. Unforgettable scores by many big 60s and 70s bands, all the way up to the 80s.Overall, a very impressive film, despite the length, which was great, but maybe more elements could have been added. This movie is a sure bet to always be in my vast library.",9,0,0,24 April 2019
The Proposal," Usual story and overblown
","Now I happen to be a big Sandra Bullock fan, but honestly, she never should have been cast in this movie.The movie itself seemed amatuerish; the ho-hum beginning, the yawn, and the big sleep. Personally also, I do not like Betty White, and her presence here just sunk the movie more into the abyss.Only reason I gave this two stars out of 10 is for the presence of Bullock. Nothing else in the movie made me laugh or chuckle. That bland.",2,3,4,1 May 2019
