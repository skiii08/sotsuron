Sucker Punch," Wait for it to hit Netflix and Redbox
","This movie was thoroughly disappointing. In the previews, it looked like a decent movie. Honestly, I saw this little girl fighting a giant samurai statue holding a Gatling gun (which me and my wife couldn't resist saying enemy death machine spinning up in the theater, CoD humor) in the previews and that got my wife and I in the theater. We both play video games and enjoy visually stunning movie battle scenes. This movie was visually stunning during the fighting scenes but the orphanage scenes were just horrible. Girl is in an mental institute/orphanage, depending on before and after the frontal lobe lobotomy has taken place, and it's all ready been known to everyone there that she's there because her father/step-father wanted to get rid of her and she had accidentally killed her little sister, which is also a lame story-line, trying to protect her. So one of the orphans asks her if she had anyone like a relative on the outside that cared about her. Um? Duh, she's an orphan, and on top of that her background has already been explained... Just so many dumb little things like throughout the entire story; the five things she needed, we were able to call out the list AND where to find the items before she said even it; her killing her sister by firing one shot that broke the light hanging from the ceiling in the closet which somehow managed to ricochet and hit a little girl curled up in the corner of a very small closet. The only positive things I can say is that the movie had very good soundtrack and the visuals were awesome. The movie was kinda fun to laugh at but most of the scenes cause involuntary eye-rolling. Watch with low expectations and it may be decent. But the soundtrack and visuals are the only reason this movie isn't getting a 1 star.",3,6,14,8 April 2011
