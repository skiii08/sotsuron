The Blair Witch Project," Go in knowing nothing
","Unfortunately, due to the preposterous amount of hype surrounding this film, almost everyone who sees it has a pretty good idea what the storyline is. This is a shame, because it means that if you've seen any of the TV shows about the movie, this will greatly spoil the effectiveness of the film. When viewed as a piece of fiction, the Blair Witch Project is not particularly scary. If approached as a factual documentary, it is much spookier. The moral is this; find out as little as possible about the film before you see it. It is also important to note that anyone expecting another teen hack-and-slash gorefest and a storyline off the back of a cornflakes box will not enjoy this film. Appreciate the fact it was made for less than $30,000 and admire the idea behind the film and you will. This film requires you to use your imagination a little if you want to experience it fully.",Null,0,1,22 December 1999
Snatch," Average
","I admire Guy Ritchie as a director, and anyone who has seen Lock, Stock... can attest to his ability, but I can't help being disappointed by Snatch. Where Lock, Stock... was thrillingly original, Snatch is confusing and overly complicated. The characters are less convincing, and the performances are pedestrian. Had this film been the work of anyone other than Guy Ritchie, it would have been touted as an unoriginal, commercialised and inferior Lock, Stock... clone. This movie proves that a bigger budget does not a better movie make.",6,0,1,7 March 2001
Schindler's List," Deeply moving WW2 film depicting the horror of the holocaust
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. While essential about the heroic quest of Oscar Schindler, it accurately reconstructs several aspects of the holocaust, and gives tremendous emotional insight into the suffering of the Jewish people during World War 2. Spielberg's use of Black and white successfully translates the viewer into the historical setting. A must see for anyone who loves great movies.",9,12,18,29 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," Beautiful and moving.
","The Thin Red Line takes the standard war movie (lots of violence, little substance, 'happy' ending where the good guys crush the bad guys) and changes it, makes it something more meaningful. The film's philosophical tone, the beautiful images of nature contrasted against the horror of war, the moving story, flawless direction, brilliant performances all round (with the exception of a slightly mis-cast Travolta) will astound and impress anyone willing to take the time to appreciate it's brillianceThe theme of nature, and the nature of man, lend this film substance on a level which most movies lack. A cinematic device whereby we can here characters thoughts as they try to make sense of what they see taking place around them provides an efficient way of allowing us to better understand them and is also a better vehicle than a narrative voice over for the moral and even existential questions which the film puts to us.The soldiers experience of the war is imparted to the viewer clearly through strong character development and wonderful camera work and cinematography. Many low angle shots make us feel as if we too are lying in the grass with the soldiers, every gunshot and artillery shell is felt as well as seen.Terrence Malick has created a film which needs to be seen time and time again to better appreciate its texture and depth, as well as for its contrasts of pure visual beauty and horrific battle images.",10,5,11,3 January 2001
