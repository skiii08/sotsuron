Black Swan," Natalie Portman Can't Save this Dying Swan
","'Black Swan'is a dark look at the world of ballet, but its only giving us a surface of what makes it so biting. Natalie Portman delivers an outstanding performance, but because we can't really relate to her or understand her motives, it just looks like a really great piece of chocolate that's too bitter to enjoy.Portman is Nina, a hyper-sensitive, vulnerable beauty that lives with her mother in New York in quite a nice pad for a single parent. There's evidence that she cuts herself and is a perfectionist, and the first time we see her dance she's punishing her poise and acting like the world is about to demolish. Over-dramatic? Of course all artists are like this, but in Nina's case she seems to be twirling in her own universe. She wants the role of the Snow Queen, the lead role in the premiere ballet of a French Director whose so positively sleazy his accent justifies his predictable actions. She confronts him in his office about getting the role, and when he tries to seduce her she bites him. 10 minutes later she finds out she has landed the role. Is the director intoxicated by her hard to get actions? Or is she just that great? Nina is a great dancer, but technique- as he points out- isn't everything. She needs to lose herself in the role of the White Swan & later the darker Black Swan. She seems to be able to play the White Swan fine. After all, the White Swan is delicate and refrained. But the Black Swan is elaborate, sultry and relaxed. Nothing that Nina is used to. This whole White Swan/Black Swan ordeal would work if we understood what makes Nina so uptight and scared when she dances? Its as if she performing for Hitler every time. I would have understood this fear more if it escalated as the rehearsals progressed. But instead, she remains psychotic from day one. It's like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining': We knew he was a nut the moment he entered the Overlook Hotel. No need to be shocked he later tried to murder his family. Nina is a mess from the start, and so she ends the same way.The other problem with 'Black Swan' is the confusion of reality. What's real and what's a hallucination? Nina meets a girl named Lily who resembles her quite a bit and also is more vivacious and forward. This tips Nina into thinking Lily is trying to back stab her for the part. Or is she just this innocent sexpot? The movie can't decide and neither can the audience. The cinematography is so jerky that we're inept to think this is all just a mind twist.Without revealing the ending, I will say its a bit daunting and underwhelming. Nina's final curtain is supposed to be a spectacular emotional moment, but instead we're still looking for clues as to what the hell is wrong with this girl, and what makes her so paranoid? Why is her mother this abstract figure in her life? Why is Lily coming across as a mysterious persona? And does her director just want sex or does he believe in her? There's also the business of Winona Ryder, who plays a brief role of a has-been who tries to warn Nina of the directors ways. After she's hurt in a senseless accident, we never really get a glimpse of her purpose. She's just thrown in for a reason to see a drunk woman say nasty obscenities to the new star.Natalie Portman luckily kept me intrigued the entire way through. She's extremely beautiful to gaze upon and her dancing is impeccable for a movie star's standards. It's just too bad even her performance can't save this dying swan that's got a lot of potential, but not enough empathy for me to care about the outcome.",5,7,13,12 January 2011
Gravity," Visually Stunning & Beautifully Crafted
","Gravity in physics means the force that attracts a body toward the center of the earth, or toward any other physical body having mass. Alfonso Cuaron's film that centers around outer space and Sandra Bullock, defines this notion both technically and emotionally. I won't get into minute details of the film; I am not a science geek nor do I aspire to be one. I will say this is outstanding to look at, and aesthetically it is a triumph of both atmosphere and boundaries. Bullock plays a doctor who, along with George Clooney- an engineer- are dealing with an abrupt crisis that causes death and despair, and then for Bullock, ultimate survival. I am not too keen on watching one-man shows unless there is something intriguing with the actor's personality. Tom Hanks succeeded to do this with Cast Away on a remote island; James Franco wasn't as successful but still sufficient in 27 Hours immersed in a cave; and Will Smith wasn't as forthcoming in I Am Legend, though that could also be because the movie itself was a laughably bad approach to isolation. Sandra Bullock, however, is quite impressive with her limited yet engaging presence. We want her to survive, but we also connect with her personally. She briefly confesses to Clooney (while they're plummeting in space) that she had a four year-old daughter who died unexpectedly. Now, she has nothing to live for. After the dire circumstances involving the mission, she must choose between accepting death, or willing to stand strong. I won't say how the film concludes, only that it is quite satisfying and beautifully executed. While Clooney does his usual dose of Clooney-isms, Bullock is great at portraying a woman that is reserved and cautious in her approach to life, but still sympathetic. The film over-all is awesome to watch and the visual effects are ahead of their time; there isn't a cartoon or CGI feel to the movie. A great experience.",9,4,8,21 November 2013
127 Hours," An Intense Experience and Great film!
","Just saw 127 Hours and this was a spectacular experience! James Franco is truly remarkable, and gives a touching and triumphant performance of a man forced to take survival to the next level. While Tom Hanks had a whole island to explore and grow on, Franco has an arm wedged in-between a rock in a canyon. And he makes the most of it, with the infamous 'amputation' scene being just as graphic and terrifying as its hyped to be.I also want to praise the ending. I have been recently let down by endings from two other Oscar contenders (Black Swan and Blue Valentine). But this one has a satisfying finish, though no movie ending has ended as emotionally as The King's Speech this year. Kudos to Danny Boyle for bringing Franco's situation to other levels by inserting visions and hyper-hallucinations into the movie.The best acting I saw from Franco was actually a smaller moment. When he's bidding farewell to the two pretty ladies who accompany him on a mini-adventure, they tell him about a party they want him to come to. As they're talking to him about it, he intertwines some 'Umm-hmmms' and 'uh-huhs' into the mix. The flat and almost automated way he speaks this dialog is extremely convincing. I have met many a guy who is sort of rushed in their way of interaction, and so the words he speaks come across muddled but still friendly. Franco also was a character who was sort of a loner in his own respect, and marched to his own drummer. And that comes across so well in Franco's interpretation.This is one of the best films of 2010, and James Franco deserved his best actor Oscar nod. Also the music is uplifting and pat, and the song 'If I Rise' is beautiful.",9,0,2,4 February 2011
Spotlight," Compelling Subject, Average Film
","The film Spotlight plays like an average Joe type of movie. There is no inspiring cinematography or unique dialogue floating off the screen. It's a clean cut film about a team of reporters who decide to expose Priests molesting children in Boston- and later, we learn, all over the world.It takes place in 2001, right when the internet was just starting to replace print journalism as the new way people read their news. As the story opens, we learn that a section of the Boston Globe- the movie's title- is suffering from low ratings and no readers. The new boss that is hired to direct the team asks the Editor of Spotlight, Michael Keaton, how long it will take for the next story to unfold. 'A few months, maybe more.' Keaton says casually. This does not make his boss very enthused. The rest of the team, which includes Mark Ruffalo as an eager reporter, and Rachel McAdams as a bland one - begin digging for clues and interviewing victims of the Priests around town. Other people in town refuse to address the topic. Stanley Tucci, who is very good, eventually lets Ruffalo interview a victim who goes into deep detail on how his molestation took place. It's rather uncomfortable to hear, but necessary. McAdams also has interviews like this, and soon everybody wants the story to release. But then September 11th hits and they decide to wait. And wait longer. While the subject matter of the movie is very interesting, I found the movie to be an uninspiring showcase of events save some strong performances- Ruffalo and Tucci are the best in show. Keaton is okay but nothing to write home about. And Rachel McAdams has NEVER been so dull. Why she's the only one in Oscar consideration is beyond me; her character lacks any personality other then to speak like a dial tone and be the sole female on the team. She can do better than this. But because the script is dominated by male personalities (and screenwriters), what more do you expect?Is this the Best Picture of 2015? According to many sources, yes. It's the default, safe choice because allegedly voters aren't going to want to crown far more intriguing movies like The Martian, Mad Max, Brooklyn or Room- to name a few titles I found far more exhilarating. It's an okay attempt to tell this important story about a corrupt justice system and of course the Catholic Church in general. But it's stale when it comes to the artistry.

500 Days of Summer," Works until the very end
","'(500) Days of Summer' is cleverly contrived, and at times very funny. The performances by the two leads are believable, concise and motivated. But despite a dependable build up of sharp characterization and witty exchanges, the conclusion is somewhat dishonest in the way it presents Zooey Deschanel's Summer.She's an independent, subdued woman, very pretty yet her eyes are hollow and almost condescending. She dates Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but makes it clear to him that she just wants a casual tryst. He understands, but of course starts falling for her. In no time at all he's making complicated reasons why she should be with him. She let's him know numerous occasions that she doesn't believe in true romance.This is all fine- a profound homage to 1970s romanticism when Diane Keaton and Glenda Jackson could be outspoken role models for their audiences. However, the ending is then a 360 degree mess- when (Spoiler) Summer meets up with Tom months later, only to be a married woman to some guy she met in a coffee shop. What gives? Wasn't she someone not into the love scene? She tells him it just happened, but like him we are confused and tired out from her reasoning.'(500) Days of Summer' is a breath of fresh air to film enthusiasts like me who love to see a storyline finally build in realism with people and relationships vs. cheap beer parties and Megan Fox taking her top off. But the screenwriter obviously needs to still give us a little more insight into why Summer's character aloofly refuses Tom, but accepts some minuscule nobody we never even get to see.",7,1,13,23 July 2009
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl Streep's best performance of the decade
","'The Devil Wears Prada' is not sheik in how it presents its material- its more pretty and layered. However, the costumes (designed by Oscar-nominee Patricia Field) certainly hold all the weight of a runway show.This was a film that probably would have been shelved into oblivion had it not been for Meryl Streep being attached to the project. Haven lost a lot of weight, dyed her hair a platinum white, and walking in with flamboyant coats, Ms. Streep seems born to play Miranda Priestley, the fierce and ruthless editor-in-chief of a top fashion magazine. She allegedly based her parody off real life editor-in-chief boss from hell Anna Wintour (from Vogue), though changed her accent to American and toned down her process of dialect to a more subtle and observant tone.So as much as I loved watching Meryl sink her teeth into her best work of the decade (her line 'Why is no one ready?' during a meeting is perhaps one of the best line deliveries I have ever witnessed), I couldn't help but cringe at Anne Hathaway's shrewd appearance, whiny manner and consistency of being a royal pain in the butt. I didn't mind Streep (or the great Emily Blunt) bossing the new assistant around because frankly she needed a dose of reality- what would-be New York journalist doesn't research the boss she's going to work for? 'The Devil Wears Prada' is basically Hathaway's journey into self-identity, complete with a hot boyfriend on the side and irritable friends to boot- as well as impossible tasks to do for Miranda (the best being to fetch the never-yet published Harry Potter manuscript).Eight stars out of ten ain't bad considering seven belong to Streep. If Helen Mirren hadn't stolen the Oscar that was meant for Meryl in 2006, we wouldn't be complaining for the academy to hand over a third Oscar for the lighter 'Julie & Julia'. But Streep embarks a clean technique in the way she handles the character, presents her anthologies, and dresses the body (Streep probably has NEVER looked better on screen, and she's 56).So please see this comedy-drama, if only to see Streep and Stanley Tucci teach the less talented Anne Hathaway how to have some true respect for the work force, and also engage in a laugh or to.FINAL GRADE: A- (all for Streep and the costumes)",8,0,0,7 August 2009
The Revenant," Beautifully Filmed but REALLY Confusing!
","I just got back from seeing The Revenant. Took my friend Helen to see it- we're both poor so we had to see a matinée and pool our money together. The movie is a total question mark. We both kept saying out loud 'What's going on???' To audible groans from our fellow audience members. At one point, Helen got up and said 'They're going to kill Leo- might as well leave now.' It was the scene where they put cloth over his eyes after that bear attack. I convinced her to stay.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a 1800s frontiersman in the rural wilderness, who's a fur trader. When their camp is attacked by vicious Indians (Native Americans), they fight and then flee.Then a bear attacks DiCaprio and in a gruesome 10 minutes we witness lot's of blood and screaming. I had to cover my eyes, and Helen went to the bathroom during this horrid turning of events. Now it starts getting confusing. Leo's gang finds him, and because he knows where they're going- they agree to carry him around on a stretcher. But Tom Hardy, the evil one of the bunch, doesn't like this. He's a power hungry mongrel. He insists they leave him for dead. But DiCaprio's companion, someone who looks Native American too, pleas they don't do that. But somehow- Leo gets abandoned, and the Native American friend is killed by Hardy. Leo then discovers the dead body of his friend- and pursues to cross the wilderness on his own. He befriends the Native Americans, saves a woman from being raped, hooks up with ANOTHER Native American who looks like his dead friend - and then has to hide in a dead horse because the bad guys return. Then he finally gets back to camp, and seeks revenge on Hardy. There's a final battle between them, and he finally kills Hardy. Then he breathes heavily in the snow- see's a 'spirit' of his dead friend, and the camera blacks out before we know if he dies or not. Just like the director did with his previous film, Birdman.Helen and I agree that while the movie was visually stunning, it didn't make much sense. There was no character development. Leonardo Dicaprio spends most of the movie mumbling. 'I couldn't understand what he was saying', Helen added. 'He's supposed to be a fur trader. As a salesman, he wasn't very customer focused. I like to hear what my salesman says to me.' We laughed at this, knowing it was a joke. But seriously- who was DiCaprio's character? There's no backstory. Hardy was also poorly written. Just evil to be evil. Everyone says Leo is winning an Oscar for this, and he does have some scenes of intensity (his big Bear scene, his reflection in the cabin towards the end)- but it's nuanced and not very showy. Hard to win when you're too subdued. And the whole Native American war didn't make a lick of sense either. What was the purpose for their battle? What benefit did either team get? They were stuck in the middle of a cold, heartless deadline. Why not make peace and work together?FINAL GRADE: C for Confusing!",7,2,7,3 January 2016
Revolutionary Road," One of the WORST Films of 2008
","Wow I am shocked at how bad this film was! It was a boring, pointless 2  hour pain that I am surprised has gotten so many great reviews. I think  many posters on here miss the point when people like me complain about  the movie. I thought Winslet was okay, but seemed mannered and  annoying. DiCaprio was just flat out annoying in this. He sounded like  a 15 year-old boy at his first high school play. Both actors seemed,  again, far too young to be playing these characters.  The film lacks story arc, structure, and most importantly...CHARACTER  DEVELOPMENT! One of the first things they teach you in film school (Mr.  Mendes) is that you need to have CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT to make your  audience care about what's happening to the people on screen. This  movie opens up with Kate and Leo fighting. We don't care about the  fight, however, because we don't know who the hell these people are. As  the movie progresses, we still don't see anything hint about who these  people are. He works at a boring job. She's a housewife. Gee, like we  never have seen one of these stories be told before. And then- nothing  happens! There's no plot! The movie is an excuse for Winslet and  DiCaprio to have yelling matches together. It's like watching a VH1  reality show shot in 35mm. What's more, we don't feel or care about the  characters. When ever Winslet cried, I cringed. It's being touted as  one of her best performances? Really? I thought it was mannered,  controlled and whiny. She's done billions times better then this stuff.  And DiCaprio is just flat-out BAD. Perhaps I would think they did  better jobs if I cared at all about the movie's premise.  On top of this, the film is morbidly predictable, and cliché.  (SPOILER!) When Kate is 'Upset' one morning, and having a fit in the  kitchen, Leo asks her what's wrong. It's so blatantly obvious she's  pregnant, and having 'Morning Cramps'. And then of course, she says she  wants an abortion. I knew what was going to happen before it did.  Mendes, a master of storytelling with American BEAUTY and ROAD TO  PERDITION, fails so low here I almost feel bad for him. Every shot of  this movie looks like its designed for Academy Awards in the Art  Direction and Cinematography department. But there's no substance at  all to the storytelling. Every shot is a silhouette or closeup of  boring dramatic angles that mean nothing other then to have dumb  audiences go 'Oooo, now that's a great camera angle.' If this movie  gets nominations from the Oscars (which it will), I will know its  because those voters haven't seen the movie yet, and are voting for it  on name bases alone.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Cate Blanchett is Incredible!
","'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is a gorgeously shot film about a boy who is born old and gray, and ages backwards. While others around him age forward and die before him, he ages the other way- and gains youth. The film, directed by David Fincher (Zodiac), and written by Eric Roth (Forrest Gump), is 167 minutes but seems to fly by as you're taken into a World War I and flown through Benjamin's lifetime of mystery, sex and love.I think what makes the film work the best is Cate Blanchett, who has never been as luminous, gorgeous or stellar. It's as if she knew her character so well, she melted into it. Blanchett meets Benjamin when she's a little girl, but as their lives intertwine, she realizes his secret, but grows to love him anyways. In some scenes involving breathtaking cinematography, the two form a bond that's stronger then sexual passion- there seems to be a spiritual trust that surges between their souls. Cate plays herself as an old woman too, and in pounds of makeup, confesses to her daughter- Ormond- about her life with Benjamin. I hope Blanchett is nominated for an Oscar for this performance, however with competition being so tight she sadly might miss. I hope she makes it.Brad Pitt is fine as Button, but I felt a certain element lacking from his performance. Tom Hanks in 'Forrest Gump' also plays a man with a disability who floats through life in amazing adventures. But Hanks was able to capture a certain depth to Gump that Pitt is overtly lacking. It seems Pitt plays Button with the same dismal note over and over again, only sometimes taking the character to another level. He is still incredible to watch.Taraja B. Henson (Hustle & Flow) is a nice surprise as Queenie, who takes care of Button once she discovers him on her doorstep. Playing the role with enough sass to put Hattie McDaniel to shame, I often found myself thinking she was playing the role to the stereotype. But she's adorable none the less.The biggest winners from 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' should be the makeup artists. Not only do they make Blanchett and Pitt appear older, but also YOUNGER! Pitt, in his 40s, at one time looks 25 again. And it's sexy as well as creepy. Blanchett, a ballet dancer in her prime of the film, is shown as a giddy 19 year-old and also a 55 year-old widow. It's brilliant to see how the makeup mixed with the actors can make this film go beyond it's level of greatness.Over-all the film has excellent music, beautiful costumes, and riveting messages about death and being happy to be alive. Tilda Swinton also turns out a brief but powerful turn as a rich woman who shows Benjamin true passion for the first time. Bravo again- to Ms. Blanchett!",10,2,5,26 December 2008
Paranormal Activity," The Most Over-Hyped Movie of the Year!
","Oh how I so wanted to be scared of this film. And truly appreciate its 'artistry'. But sadly, I am mundane and skeptical. Here is a film made for less than $15,000 that is now on its way to grossing over $100 million domestically. It is pretty much 'The Blair Witch Project' ten years later. While that film captured true horror by never showing us anything remotely 'horrific', it was the idea of the horror that led us to find the movie chilling and heroic.'Paranormal Activity', which by the way should read 2009, not 2007, under IMDb, is a loathsomely tedious experience. It builds nicely- I admit I was nervous in the first thirty minute cycle. We meet the couple. He is a salicylic investment banker, she's his clingy girlfriend. They move into a nice house that has a pool that's apparently larger then their turf. But we know from the start why this is shot on a handy-cam. He has been videotaping their life because of the 'activity' that has been going on. Weird noises at night. Bumps from downstairs. And worse of all- unexplainable happenings like fires starting, footsteps appearing, and actual levitation miraculously occurring.Perhaps what makes this synopsis so frightening are two things. One, the couple appear to be real. Its like watching your friends on home video. Two, no music soundtrack. So you basically have to endure long periods of silence while their sleeping, ultimately wondering what will happen next. That part's scary. What's not scary is what actually happens. (Do not read further if you don't wish to be informed).Without giving away too much, let's just say the happenings become more hokey, and if you're not religious you'll really laugh a quite a bit of what happens (there's a scene where the woman is dragged out of bed by the 'demon' and flung to the floor, where the door slams behind her.) Many screamed in the audience. I was trying my best not to laugh too hard.The conclusion of this over-hyped fiasco is what really makes me cringe. Without giving too much away, let's just say too much is revealed in too scarce amount of time for us to care, or sympathize, or even understand. If you've seen 'The Ring', you'll get a general idea of where I'm coming from.'Paranormal Activity' has been dubbed by some as the most frightening movie ever made. Hardly. It's not even the scariest film of the year. It's clever at best, but not scary or frightening except maybe when you dread what will happen. The critics who knight it the best ever have either only watched movies that have come out in the past decade, or simply have not seen 'The Shining', 'Jacob's Ladder', 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Silence of the Lambs', 'Psycho' or 'The Exorcist'- let alone 'Rosemary's Baby'- which is still the best horror film to contrive the idea of demonic happenings without revealing it. Save your money on this dud and rent it on Netflix. You're sure to conjure up more 'paranormal' activity in your own work life then what is presented here.",3,7,13,30 October 2009
Steve Jobs," Boring, Uneventful & Slow
","Steve Jobs has one of the worst movie titles in film history. Of all the names for the marketing team to come up with, this was the weakest one. If the Ashton Kutcher movie hadn't been released already, I am betting the farm this would have been named Jobs. That being said, the movie plays REALLY long- and until the ending, it's a talky bore.Michael Fassbender plays the title role, and although he's a fine actor- Christian Bale (the original choice), should have been cast. Nonetheless Fassbender does what he can. We witness how the co-founder of Apple is during three behind-the-scenes unveiling's for his product, all before the 2000s. When watching the movie, I was reminded of The Iron Lady with Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher. Both that film and this center around a famous public figure, but the movies aren't really about them or told as biopics. They are more personalized and experimental. Streep's movie is really about how a woman deals with dementia and her love for her husband. Fassbender's movie really is about how a man deals with narcissism and his love for his daughter. Both films are uneven and messy because the focus is too grounded in emotion, when the audience is more interested in their overall lives and not just these niche moments. Because of this, both movies are not that interesting to watch- but are elevated by strong performances. Streep won an Oscar for her role, and Fassbender will be nominated.Kate Winslet, with an uneven accent, plays Steve Jobs' assistant who is the only person who can really stand up to him (well, that's a lie- since Seth Rogan and Jeff Daniels also have cat fights). I was a little annoyed with Winslet's personality, and awful hairdo. She starts getting on my nerves when she threatens to quit unless Steve can patch things up with his daughter. Any professional knows not to mix business with personal- and her job is to work for Apple, not be a therapist. Winslet is okay in her scenes, but her character is unlikable. If I were Steve Jobs, I would have fired her.Then there's the business of Lisa- the daughter, and I guess the TRUE emotional back-story for the movie's purpose. Forget that I'm worth billions of dollars, I better run after my little girl and remind her that I plan to invent the iPod for her songs and that I remembered some dumb painting she made on the Macintosh when she was 5. The daughter is also unnerving because Steve Jobs was paying child support, and didn't love the Mother anymore. He owes nothing to his daughter if he doesn't wish to donate- but he attempts to show he cares, and she eventually folds in the parking lot (which looks just like the parking lot in the Tom Cruise movie Vanilla Sky).Steve Jobs is talky and overtly uncinematic, so I was restless when viewing it. There is nothing happening but a lot of nerdy white people talking really fast and using big words to impress folks. Oh, sound like The Social Network all over again? Well, Aaron Sorkin wrote that too. He's not a good screenwriter- he's an elitist who has a big vocabulary. But he sucks at creating characters that are believable. Fassbender and Daniels aside, this movie is one of 2015's biggest disappointments. FINAL GRADE: D",4,102,204,29 December 2015
The Big Short," One of the BEST Films of 2015!
","Just finished The Big Short- blows Spotlight out of the water! I loved it. The first 10 minutes made me think it was trying to ripoff The Wolf of Wall Street and GoodFellas with 'gangsta tawk' voice- overs and camera stills, but trust me- this is not a distraction once the story gets going. While Spotlight focuses on the topic of scandalous Priests and the Catholic Church, The Big Short focuses on the housing market crash and corporate greed. In terms of topics alone, Big Short feels more important. I'm not downgrading the former movie's subject matter and dismissing it entirely. I'm simply stating Big Short already has a theme voters will relate to more.Now let's get to the rest. First of all, Kudos to Adam McKay- this is a splendidly vibrant and compelling movie, and his direction is quick and alive. I think he's a VERY strong contender for Best Director, not only in the nomination department- but also the win. We'll see what DGA says, but right now he's in my predictions. The acting was stronger then the ensemble work in Spolight, the former movie having a solid cast but no one seemed to really come to life save Tucci and Ruffalo. Where as here, EVERYBODY is electrifying. Christian Bale and Steve Carell are the standouts, and Bale def deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Carell also - WOW- just didn't expect him to be this good after being slightly underwhelmed with his work last year in Foxcatcher. But he's brilliant in this- and both him and Bale are also very funny! I also enjoyed Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Finn Wittrock, Jeremy Strong, John Magaro and Marisa Tomei (the latter being a relief to see playing a wife who's actually the proper age; if this movie had been directed by David O. Russell, ten points for guessing who he would have cast). The screenplay is also fresh and informative. Even if you're someone like me who doesn't understand all the fundamentals or backdrops for what caused the housing market crash or how banks operate, this movie breaks it down so it's a little more clear- and in fun, innovative ways including a cameo by Selena Gomez playing blackjack in Las Vegas. I know Spotlight is still the favorite, but with a year so open and full of surprises- looking for an alternative to go against it might be The Big Short and not the sci-fi threesome (which may be a two pair or just a loner by Oscar Nomination morning). The Golden Globes are on January 10th- and if any movie is beating The Martian for the Comedy Globe, this is your horse to bet on. The SAG Ensemble award also could be going to The Big Short cast, which in my eyes did a hell of a better job then Spotlight's must quieter group",10,4,8,30 December 2015
Casino," An epic vision from Scorsese
","'Casino' is a three hour look into 1970s Las Vegas, and how the Mob once held vicious control over how it operated. Robert De Niro, in one of his finest performances, plays a well-to-do perfectionist whose obligation is to get things done right. A superman for running his Casino, his kryptonite is Sharon Stone. She's a sultry casino hustler who makes her way in big bills by making sure all the 'insiders' are taken care of. De Niro is in love, but she warns him she doesn't love him, but still agrees to marry him. There's also Joe Pesci, playing a loud-mouthed, violent buddy of De Niro's, who will jump on anyone who makes him feel threatened.All in all 'Casino' is a terrific ride, and also very long. One is of course, reminded of 'GoodFellas', because Pesci plays basically the same role he played there. And of course there's all the violence and destruction, but we like this. For three hours, I was never bored. I was aware how long I had been sitting, but I never found myself tapping my fingers. Scorsese knows how to keep his audience intrigued, and this is a good thing at 180 minutes.Then there is Sharon Stone. I must say I was very surprised with her performance. She is over-the-top in many scenes, but her character is initially an annoying child. So this is how she is supposed to play it. Trust me if you don't think Stone can play it cool, watch 'Basic Instinct' again. Although she never has had a very impressive career, she has had her share of good roles (Along with 'Casino' and 'Basic Instinct', watch her in 'Total Recall', 'Last Dance' and 'Gloria'). She earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and deservedly so. I think her performance is astonishing, and definitely puts 'Casino' into a higher league then it would have been had it not had her in it.",9,1,2,18 October 2006
