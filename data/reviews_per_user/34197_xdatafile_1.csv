The Blair Witch Project," Scariest movie ever... don't compare The Shining with this...
","This film is excellent. It was great because recorded with only two cameras.The film was made with a very small budget no explosives or anything.Not very known celebrities. But still i've watched many scary horror and thriller film's.You can't compare any of the films that i've seen with this one.I once watched Shining with my cousin at 12 O'clock and it was pretty scared.I watched this film with my father at 21 and I have never been so scared it was the scariest film i've ever seen.People who wan't action or don't want to be scared, don't watch this. This film is the best production of all the time. Watch it.",10,1,3,12 May 2007
