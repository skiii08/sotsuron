Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not As Good As The First But Not Bad
","Volume 2 Kill Bill: Vol. 2 Starring Uma Thurman David Carradine Daryl Hannah Michael Madsen Michael Parks Music by Robert Rodríguez Cinematography Robert Richardson Release date(s) April 16, 2004 Running time 136 min. Budget $30 million USD [2] All Movie Guide profile IMDb profile A few minutes before the events that open the first volume, Bill (Carradine) tracks down The Bride and her friends as they are gathered for her wedding rehearsal. He is polite and mild-mannered, and even consents to being introduced to the groom as her father. She takes her place at the altar as the other four Deadly Vipers arrive at the chapel, weapons in tow, to kill everyone at the rehearsal.In the present, Bill ventures to the California desert to talk to his brother Budd, aka 'Sidewinder' (Madsen), another former Deadly Viper. Bill warns him that The Bride will come for him next. Budd, now overweight and alcoholic, has put his assassin days behind him, lives in a trailer and works as a bouncer at a local strip club and has lost his former respect to his new boss.The Bride arrives at Budd's trailer that night to take his life. Anticipating her entry, Budd shoots her in the chest with rock salt the moment she opens his door, then injects her with a sedative. Budd calls Driver and offers to sell her The Bride's Hanzo sword for one million dollars. The Bride is buried alive by Budd.As she lies in her grave, The Bride remembers her early training in China, when Bill took her to the temple of legendary martial arts master Pai Mei (an intentionally classic example of the elderly martial arts master stock character). He uses cruelty as a tool for discipline and obedience. Although he 'hates Caucasians, despises Americans and has nothing but contempt for women', he takes The Bride in. Her training was extremely rigorous, and she endured many hardships, but she became a formidable warrior under his tutelage. In the present, The Bride calls on Pai Mei's training to break out of the coffin and claw her way up to freedom.",9,1,2,4 July 2007
Vertigo," Well Done Alfred you've done it again.
","Vertigo is a 1958 psychological thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film features James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. The film tells the story of a Vertigo sufferer and police detective, John Ferguson, who believes that his newly found girlfriend is a reincarnation of a possessed woman who he saw commit suicide in the San Francisco Bay, after being assigned to investigate what was wrong with her. Both women are portrayed by Novak.It was premiered in the San Sebastian International Film Festival on May 8, 1958, where it was received poorly, polarising both critics and commercial audiences. However, as the film aged, it has become one of the most recognised, acclaimed American films ever made. In 1989, Vertigo was recognised as a 'culturally, historically and aesthetically significant' film by the National Film Registry and subsequently restored internationally in 1996.",10,5,6,4 July 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This movie sucks!!!
","This is the most sick, disgusting thing ever I mean these are all the bad things about it and why you should not see it or get rid of it.Half the time Borat is naked as well as showing photos of his sons willy, having a gay fight with a naked fat man and going to a gay parade.This film has a rubbish story line and some times tries to be too funny when I didn't laugh. The film is about borat going to America and going looking for someone from bay watch.I mean who allowed this to be made!!-2/10",1,5,10,10 July 2007
Citizen Kane," Amazing
","Citizen Kane is a 1941 mystery/drama film released by RKO Pictures and directed by Orson Welles, his first feature film. The story traces the life and career of Charles Foster Kane, a man whose career in the publishing world was born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolved into a ruthless pursuit of power and ego at any cost. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is revealed through the research of a newspaper reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word, 'Rosebud.' Citizen Kane is often cited as being one of the most innovative works in the history of film. In 1998 and again in 2007 the American Film Institute placed it at number one in its list of the 100 greatest U.S. movies of all time. In a recent poll of film directors conducted by the British Film Institute, Citizen Kane was ranked number one best film of all time.The film's main character, Charles Foster Kane, was inspired by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. Upon its release, mention of the film was conspicuously absent from Hearst's newspapers.",Null,0,1,4 July 2007
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Great
","South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is an Academy Award-nominated animated satirical comedy/musical film released in 1999 and based on the animated television series South Park.

Hot Fuzz," Comedy, Action and Horror ! ! !
","Multiple nods to Shaun of the Dead are also made, including the fence-based short cut ('What's the matter Danny? Never taken a short cut before?'), but with a role reversal of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the one-worded Cornetto requests, the way Angel and Danny describe some suspicious characters on the street, a pub slot machine jingle (Oo-ah-Dracula) heard in the 'Winchester', the product advertised in the pub; in Shaun, the rifle in the Winchester was thought to be deactivated but was not while in Hot Fuzz, it was thought the sea mine was also deactivated but was not.Also, when the massive shoot-out is taking place, Danny asks where they should go, to which Angel replies 'Pub?' which is also said with the roles reversed in Shaun. In Shaun, Ed (Nick Frost) is said to have shot his sister in the foot with an air-rifle. In Hot Fuzz, Danny shoots Dr. Hatcher in the foot twice: the first time, accidentally with an air rifle; the second time, deliberately by 'surrendering' his shotgun. Most blatantly, the UK DVD - altered to show the Spanish title of Zombies Party - is briefly seen in a supermarket bargain bin, with a price sticker covering Pegg's face.",10,1,2,27 June 2007
The Others," Scary
",The story line is a bit confusing at first but as the film continues it slowly unravels until you find out that they're actually DEAD! Really good idea.The scariest bit is when Nichole Kidman is wondering around her house with the oil lamp and she goes into her daughters room and sees her in a brides dress and so she slowly wakes around her until she stops and takes the bridal vale and there is that creepy old lady there! Also what really scared me was the dead people that haunt Nichole Kidman and then they tell them that their dead. also Scary Movie 3 spoofs it.SCARY10/10,10,1,4,19 June 2007
Scary Movie 2," Fun To Watch
","The Exocist spoof is probably the best part in the whole movie. In fact I have the song they sing on the piano that goes - 'Shake your ass watch you self...' etc. on my mp3 which I love it makes me laugh every time I see it and I never get bored of it. Also inside the Exorcist spoof is The Amitiville Horror spoof which is so funny i cried with laughter.James Woods is good as Father McFreely and he should have got an award for that, James should try and be main character for something as he is so good, shame.6/10",6,0,2,10 July 2007
American Pie," I Love This Film !!!
","Here Are Some Facts...American Pie is a 1999 teen comedy film directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz and written by Adam Herz. This was the first film directed by the Weitz brothers. The movie is centred on four boys who make a pact to lose their virginity by their high school graduation, and their subsequent adventures. The title refers to a scene in the film in which the lead character is caught having sex with a pieearlier he was told that 'third base' feels 'like warm apple pie'. It was a box-office hit and spawned two direct sequels: American Pie 2 in 2001, American Wedding in 2003. Singer Don McLean was credited for allowing the name of his hit song to be used as the title.This film ranked number 49 on Bravo's '100 Funniest Movies', and ranked number 32 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted American Pie the 6th greatest comedy film of all time.Since the conclusion of the American Pie trilogy, featuring the courtship and marriage of Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty, the American Pie name has gone on to be used as an entity similar to National Lampoon. The American Pie entity has spawned three spin-off films: American Pie Presents: Band Camp, which was a direct to video release in 2005, and American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile was released on DVD in December 2006. The next film, American Pie Presents: Beta House will be released in 2007.",10,0,2,28 September 2007
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's Best
","Cary Grant stars as Roger O'Hornthill as a mistaken spy by foreign intelligence in this classic thriller. What was good about it was the way how you get so hooked in by the film you don't want it to stop especially the ending on the top of Mt. Rushmoore! If you have seen From Russia With Love then you will know that near the end there is the scene where Bond gets chased by a helicopter,doesn't that sound familiar? Of course it does because the same thing happens in this which was made 4 years before it only though its not a helicopter in this film oh no its a Crop Spraying plane! Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10",10,0,2,19 June 2007
The Shining," Scary !
","The Shining has every thing that a good horror film has and not many horrors do that. Jack Nicholson delivers great acting and actually looks like he is going mad, so good! My favourite scene like probably everyone else's is the 'Here's Johnny!' bit it is probably one of the most famous lines and scenes in cinema history.Although the film trails off a bit from the Stephen King Book it still is really good and I recommend it to everyone that hasn't seen it and is reading this comment. Sherly Duvall was good but still she got a razzie award for worst actress ?????? Plus Stanley Kurbick was nominated for the best director but then got another nomination for worst director!!!10/10",10,1,2,18 July 2007
The Evil Dead," Good Amount Of Gore !
","Wow this is what a zombie film is all about. It mixes between a slasher film like Friday 13th with a zombie film like Night Of The Living Dead because there isolated in a forest- (Slasher) and they get attacked by flesh eating zombies- (Zombie Film what more could you ask for!! Also the effects are really good especially for its time, 1981!I haven't seen the sequel but I gather that it is better than this one so I really want to get it. I hope that it IS as good as the 1st and as gory.Sam Raimi's best piece of work.10/10",10,1,2,17 July 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Violent but good
","Volume 1 The Bride (Thurman) is introduced to the audience in a blood-spattered wedding gown immediately after a violent showdown at a Texas wedding chapel. She attempts to tell her would-be killer, Bill (Carradine), that she is pregnant with his baby, but he shoots her in the side of the head.Four years later, The Bride arrives at the house of Deadly Viper Vernita Green (Fox), codenamed Copperhead. Vernita and The Bride engage in a brutal fight, with The Bride eventually killing Green in front of her four-year-old daughter Nikki. She tells the girl that she's sorry for killing her mom in front of her, and that if the young girl wishes to avenge her death when she grows up, The Bride will be waiting. The Bride then leaves in a yellow pick-up truck.A flashback to the events after the wedding reveals that the comatose Bride is the only survivor of the massacre. Elle Driver, a.k.a. California Mountain Snake, the one-eyed assassin who has replaced the Bride as Bill's lover, slips into the hospital ward intending to inject poison into The Bride's intravenous line. She is stopped at the last second by Bill, who believes The Bride deserves a more honourable death.The Bride wakes up from her coma in the present and escapes from the hospital after killing an orderly named Buck, who has been selling sexual access to her body as she lay unconscious. She steals Buck's truck, the Pussy Wagon, and hides in the back seat as she slowly works her limbs out of atrophy. In the back of the truck, The Bride narrates the story of another Deadly Viper, O-Ren Ishii (Liu), codename: Cottonmouth. The events are shown in anime form. O-Ren rose to the top of the Japanese crime world as well as working as a highly paid assassin. The segment introduces her personal bodyguard Go-Go Yubari, her friend and lawyer Sofie Fatale (another protégé of Bill), and Johnny-Mo, leader of O-Ren's personal army, the Crazy 88.The Bride travels to Okinawa to get a katana from Hattori Hanzō (Chiba), a renowned sword-smith, who has retired. Though Hanzo has taken an oath to never make another sword, The Bride is able to convince him of the merit of her mission, and he forges for her the best sword he has ever created.The Bride tracks O-Ren to a hangout called the 'House of Blue Leaves', where a band (The 5,6,7,8's) is performing. The Bride arrives wearing a yellow motorcycle jump suit (an homage to Bruce Lee movies), taking Fatale hostage to lure O-Ren from her dinner. O-Ren dispatches Yubari and dozens of the Crazy 88 to deal with The Bride, who proceeds to wage war on her henchmen. The Bride then turns her attention to O-Ren, climaxing in a dramatic sword fight in a snowy garden (which borrows heavily from the Japanese sexploitation film Sex & Fury).The film ends with the revelation by Bill that The Bride's daughter is still alive, though this is not revealed to her.",10,0,2,4 July 2007
Psycho," Brilliant, the mother of all horror films
","Some people say that this the best film ever, well I agree this was good and the plot was so good it left me guessing all the way through but probably the only bad thing about it is that its one of those films where you watch it once and thats it because you already know whats going to happen and it kind of spoils the whole film when you watch it again. What really surprised me was that the blood from the notorious 'shower scene' was actually chocolate syrup! For me after 'North By Northwest' this was Hitchcock's best piece of work. Every movie has a bit where it probably would never happen and Psychos is the death where the detective gets stabbed at the top of the stairs and manages to slide all of the way down them again BACKWARDS! But other than that I say well done to the great Alfred Hitchcock",10,0,0,5 June 2007
Jaws," Steven's Best
","Jaws has spawned a number of sequels, Jaws 2,3 and Jaws 4: The Revenge and has been copied by some other films such as, Piranah, Lake Placid and Deep Blue Sea plus more.Jaws is good for Horror lovers and gore lovers as each death is good, very good.At the beginning of the film two people, boy and girl, go swimming, well the lady does. As she is swimming something grabs her and hurls her bake and forth until she just screams to death.Well done Steven Spielberg10/10",10,2,4,19 June 2007
Scream," Horror had fallen until ' Scream ' came along.
","Scream is a 1996 horror film, directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. The film revitalised the slasher film genre in the mid 1990s, similar to what Halloween (1978) did for the 1970s, by using a standard concept with a tongue-in-cheek approach that successfully combined straightforward scares with dialogue that satirised slasher film conventions, (for example, the final girl). The film features many teen idols of the time, including; Neve Campbell, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and in addition, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Liev Schreiber.Scream became a major commercial success upon its release, and was one of the highest grossing films of 1996. It was also highly acclaimed by many critics worldwide, who appreciated the film's tongue-in-cheek approach. It got an 86% rating at rottentomatoes.com. As a result it spawned two sequels, Scream 2 and Scream 3.The film also provided the direct inspiration for the horror movie parody tetralogy, beginning with Scary Movie (2000)which also became a box office success, spawning its own three sequels, as of 2007.",10,0,1,8 July 2007
Casino Royale," Bad, Very Bad
","As I said not bad but like every James Bond movie it has too many unbelievable bits in it like the chase scene just after the opening credits when Bond is chasing the man and they jump off a crane, now come on at least a broken leg from that! If you watch the scene where Bond and the Assassin are fighting in the car at the airport and they are heading straight for the big special plane whilst going about 50mph it takes them about five minuets to get there and in that time Bond manages to free himself from the bad guy get hold of the steering wheel and stop the car! This isn't an unbelievable bit but what I find a let down is that Bond is too rough and hardly ever uses a gun. So if you compare the climax of The Spy Who Loved Me Bond uses a gun but a fight scene from Casino Royale, well he uses his fists.",10,7,12,10 July 2007
Rear Window," Chilling.
","Rear Window is a 1954 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story It Had to Be Murder. It stars James Stewart as photojournalist 'L.B. Jefferies', Grace Kelly as his fashion model girlfriend 'Lisa Carol Fremont', and Raymond Burr as the suspected killer 'Lars Thorwald'. The film combines its main theme of a murder mystery, with a critical examination of the ethics of marriage and voyeurism. It is considered by many film goers, critics and scholars to be one of Hitchcock's best and most thrilling pictures. (FOR YOUR CONCERN)THIS IS SPOOFED IN 'THE SIMPSONS' AND IT IS Really FUNNY ! ! !",10,0,3,4 July 2007
The Birds," Amazing Effects
","The Birds was made in 1963 for Christ sakes and yet the effects still amaze me because if you compare the effects for this film with the one in Jaws 3 the you'd think that this was made years before it. The bit where Melanie is stuck in the phone booth is my favourite bit because its well spoofed in the Simpsons, or the scene where that man is dead and his eyes are pecked out.I cant believe that it is being remade in 2009. They should leave things alone like with the ridiculous amounts of sequels like with Halloween or Friday the 13th.10/10",10,2,3,11 July 2007
The Simpsons Movie," f.u.n.n.y !!!!
","I am a fan of the Simpson's and haves the show since i was about 8-9 and I am so pleased that they have made a film of it. I first new about it when i was watching a program about it in 2005 and until this year its finally come out after almost 2 years of waiting!!!! The only bad thing was that the TV advert kind of ruined it because when i was at the cinema watching a film, when the adverts came on I laughed at the jokes in it like spider pig. But when i watched the film the spider pig wasn't that funny. But at least the bits not shown we good.8/10",10,0,2,28 September 2007
Dodgeball," So Funny!!!!
","Such a great cast in this film, Hank Azaria from 'the Simpson's' as O'Houlihan. Ben Stiller 'Meet the Parents' as White Goodman. Vince Vaughn 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' as Peter La Fluer. Not only that but also great lines. Eg. O'Houlihan-'Is it necessary for me to drink my own urine, no, but I do it any way cos its sterile and I like the taste'. HA HA HA!!!!! Also I think that the story line is a bit too simple I mean the fact that a gym owe money and enter a competition the win 50,000 dollars I think, which just happens to be the same amount they owe!!!But I don't care.????????????????????????????????????????????????? 8/10",10,0,1,28 September 2007
