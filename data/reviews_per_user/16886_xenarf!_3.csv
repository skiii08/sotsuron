Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," it was all so bad jarjar didn't even bother me
","I lack the sufficient words to properly convey the utter horror and disappointment i suffered while staring up at a sci-fi extravaganza devoted entirely to big-budget special effects and to the promotion of merchandise. Somewhere in the practically non-existent script all the magic and wonder of the Star Wars trilogy was lost to the attempt to achieve blockbusterdom. An overdose of mediocre acting (except Natalie Portman, the saving grace of the movie), horrible and heartless dialogue, and pointless characters are a disgrace to the original trilogy. >",2,0,1,9 June 1999
Sleepy Hollow," all i can say is OUCH..
","Alas, the day of the fall of Burton has come. We all knew it had to come, as with other legendaries before him (such as Raimi - For Love of the Game? Bleech!). It seemed this film would have been much less painful to watch if the complicated-to-the-point-of-jargon script was abandoned and the entire movie consisted of the Headless Horseman doing his own thing. No point to ANY of the characters...ANY! Why did Casper van Dien bother gaining 30 lbs for a 30-second role??? Danny Elfman seems to have lost all ability to compose his classically haunting scores. At least i agree with the title - the writer must have been both SLEEPY and HOLLOW at the time.",4,1,3,21 November 1999
Pitch Black," I admit it! I actually liked it.
","In light of the recent surge of mindless (bordering on stupid), effects-oriented blockbusters hitting theaters (Lost in Space? Godzilla?) it is refreshing to see an entertaining film in this genre that attempts to be ambitious through cinematic techniques other than CGIs. The first half is a pleasantly bizarre and almost artsy blend of choppy editing, a variety of odd camera angles, and alien lighting effects. Even if the characters, plot, or dialogue are lacking or ridiculous, at the very least it's not boring. Unfortunately the second half (once the darkness sets in) reverts back to the traditional formula of the sci-fi horror, however the movie has its moments, which is more than a disturbing number of recent similar films have had to offer.",Null,0,1,25 May 2000
