Vertigo," My Favourite Film of all Time
","This movie absolutely blew me away. I have the movie poster framed in my room so that must be an indication of how mucg i love it.I have a fascination with movies from the time period this was made in and seeing as Hitchcock is one of my favourite directors I thought I would check it out. Hitchcock's cinematography is beautiful as always, the camera is almost a character itself. The story is suspenseful and well written. The use of colour is vibrant and well thought out, the score is great, the special effects mostly hold up to a degree, all the performances are perfects, i especially liked all the little nuances and expressions in James Stewart's performance, the highlight of the film.And that twist genuinely surprised me and caught me off guard, I was not expecting it and I didn't even recognize Kim Novak when she was Judy. The ending wassudden and unexpected, I'm still thinking about it.I love this movie, would definitely recommend it.",10,1,2,20 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Amazing work again by Tarantino
","I absolutely loved this film. Tarantino's flawless cinematography brings this vibrant world and it's rich characters and their story to glorious life. The score is very well thought out fitting the time period perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now and Brad Pitt is the coolest man alive. What keeps it away from being 10/10 is the movie starts to drag slightly a bit towards the end of the second act. Nevertheless, there isn't a dull moment and the ending is my favourite of any film ever.",9,6,9,7 September 2019
