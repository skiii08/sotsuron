The Blair Witch Project," Unique, Haunting and Original.
","The Blair Witch Project is not your average horror film. I did not expect it to be what it was like, which was bad and differently shot. But, the way this film is shot isn't bad at all, and the film is actually a great surprise!The first few minutes are disorienting, deliberately shot with all the shakiness of raw footage from some backpacker's video diary. The actors, using their real names, swiftly establish soon-to-fray relationships: Heather (Donahue) is the director willing to suffer for her art who doesn't care if others suffer less willingly with her, cameraman Josh (Leonard) is the slacker-type along for the ride and sound technician Mike (Williams) is mostly concerned with making sure they get the rented equipment back on time. After interviewing a couple of locals about the legend, the foolhardy trio head into the woods, and everything starts to fall apart.Everything about this film is powerfully real, the performances are all very polished and excellent, Heather Donahue was amazing, she did not deserve her Razzie award, even though she got annoying, her performance still lives long in the memory. Mike Williams is frightfully good and Josh Leonard is towering. The directional debut from Edward Myrick and Eduardo Sachez leaves you wanting more, I can't wait until their next film. The screenplay is extremely unique and memorable, I have never seen a piece of writing that seems so realistic.Chillingly memorable and stunningly filmed, The Blair Witch Project has made it's place in film history as one of the most haunting films ever made.I rate The Blair Witch Project 8 out of 10.",9,3,5,24 November 2000
Antz," Not Really My Type of Film.
","Antz looked like quite an interesting premise, I was absolutely intrigued to see it. Unfortunately, I was bored stiff during this imaginative but near-unwatchable film.The action hones straight in on Z-4195 (Woody Allen), a worker ant living a blue-collar existence among a colony of millions, who is none too happy with his lot in life. Possible escape comes in the form of the lovely Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), with whom he becomes smitten after an impromptu dance at a bar, only for a string of mishaps to occur in his attempts to impress her: 'Z' becomes a war hero, a revolutionary, and finally kidnaps Bala, stranding the pair in the outside world. Meanwhile, it becomes increasingly clear that Bala's fiancÂŽ, General Mandible (Gene Hackman), is one untrustworthy ant.The story is original, but the idea of computer-generated war ants is used poorly. The actors are a major upside to Antz, Sylvester Stallone who plays `Z's war buddy is excellent for a change, and Woody Allen is amusingly choice as `Z.' The characters are plenty likeable and the direction is great, but Antz drags on for many large drinks of coke, and the story soon begins to lose track of where its going.Antz isn't all that terrible, I guess it isn't my type of film. For slightly more impressive computer-generated work, check out the similar A Bug's Life.I rate Antz 5 out of 10.",5,1,1,23 November 2000
Meet the Parents," One of the best of the year 2000!
","I got told by my parents that Meet the Parents was 9.5/10 film. I was really looking forward to seeing this, and from the first minute of the film, I could tell I was going to like it...and I loved it in the end!On the verge of proposing to his lovely girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo), Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is faced with one final hurdle: meeting her parents. And when it transpires that daddy, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro), is a retired CIA spycatcher masquerading as a florist, the weekend from hell commences as Greg's every attempt to impress his prospective father-in-law goes hopelessly awry.Meet the Parents is a real winner. All the jokes are successful and funny, I was laughing so hard I barely breathed. Sometimes there are downright sad and emotional scenes, though, but it is the comic writing that wins the day - if the script does not get some sort of award there will be no justice, it is an endlessly creative, mercilessly entertaining piece of writing to be truly cherished. The performances are excellent - Ben Stiller is immaculate once again, he is becoming one of my favourite actors, many of the jokes relate to his other characters (especially about his Jewish Rabbi character in Keeping the Faith) and Robert DeNiro, who is already one of my favourite actor's, puts in a clean-cut performance, he hasn't done a film this good in God knows how long. Jay Roach is also a star, this is even funnier than his previous project, Austin Powers! And that is a big achievement all on it's own!Easily one of the best of 2000, Meet the Parents is comedic brilliance in filmmaking. A must-see for everyone.I rate Meet the Parents 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,29 December 2000
Unbreakable," Quite A Disappointment, But Not Completely Awful.
","M. Night Shyamalan's first film, The Sixth Sense, was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life. But, however, his second feature, Unbreakable, does definitely not meet these standards.Security Guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia. Not only is he the sole survivor out of 132 passengers, he also is completely unharmed. A little later, comic book specialist Elijah Price contacts him to confront David with an incredible theory: Elijah, who has been nicknamed 'Mr. Glass' due to his more than fragile bones, thinks that David has got all which he himself lacks. The two of them 'seem to be linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends'. First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't. Slowly, David begins to discover the shocking truth behind Mr. Price's assumptions. But after all, David's fate is not only to find his real place in the world. It also is about proving Elijah's theory of his own existence. There are lots of good things about Unbreakable. But, unfortunately there are many bad things. The writing is somewhat rushed, while the characters are hardly developed before the action part of the film begins, and sometimes Unbreakable is just too slow and too boring for its own good. But, some of these bad things are saved by some good performances (including a blaster from Spencer Treat Clark), M. Night Shyamalan's magical directing touch and rare thrilling action sequences.Not memorable, or brilliant, but it should keep you interested for a couple of hours.I rate Unbreakable 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,15 December 2000
Fight Club," Near perfect.
","Many friends had recommended Fight Club to me, so when I missed it at the theatre, I was a bit p****d off. Then came the chance for video, and wow! was it an experience...Edward Norton stars as Jack, a chronic ismoniac desperate to escape his excruciatingly boring life. That's when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad pitt), a charismatic soap salesman with a twisted philosophy. Tyler belives that self-improvement is for the weak - self-destruction is for the strong and capable. Before long, Jack and Tyler are beating each other to a pulp in a bar parking lot. To introduce other men  to the simple joys of physical violence, Jack and Tyler start a secret underground Fight Club which becomes widly successful. But there is a big surprise coming towards Jack...There are about 2 flaws which stop this film from being a complete masterpiece. It may be slightly too slow-moving for some of the crowd, and some of the things the fight club members do are wildly far-fetched. But, still, there is an array of dazzling performances, particularly from our two leads, who both play their characters realistically and with absolute honesty and passion. David Fincher goes beyond what he did in Se7en, and that is quite an achievement to beat. Jim Uhls adapts the Fight Club book perfectly, making a screenplay which is, infact, better than the actual book itself.The first rule of Fight Club is - 'You must see Fight Club.'I rate Fight Club 9 out of 10.",10,0,1,10 January 2001
As Good as It Gets," Great!
","I had heard As Good As It Gets was a great film, but then again, I was told Anaconda was a great film, so I didn't know what it was going to be like. The result of As Good As It Gets was very good indeed, actually, forget that. It was great!Melvin, played by an impressive Jack Nicholson, earns his crust, absurdly, writing cheesy romance novels, and lives as reclusively as he can in a Manhattan apartment. One of his obsessive rituals is breakfasting daily at a cafe where only salty waitress Carol (Helen Hunt) - a single mother with her own stressful woes - will tolerate Melvin's diatribes and sass him back.When Simon (Greg Kinnear), a gay artist who lives across the hall, is hospitalised, old misery-guts Melvin is coerced by Simon's agent (Cuba Gooding Jr.) into caring for his despised neighbour's ugly but endearing mutt and - you betcha! - bonding is soon afoot as the pooch wags its way into Melvin's corroded heart. Thus softened up, Melvin is reluctantly but irrevocably goaded into a series of grudging good deeds which are entirely motivated by self-interest but which inch him in the general direction of humanity and improbable but superb redemption. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Academy Awards for their memorable, brilliant performances, but the rest of the cast aren't bad when it comes to acting. Greg Kinear is excellent, Cuba Gooding Jr. is great as usual and a brief but impressive performance from Skeet Ulrich secures As Good As It Gets' supporting cast. James L. Brooks is also the perfect director for this film, his efforts to make this film great succeed.   This dramatic but funny film is well worth a look.I rate As Good As It Gets 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,23 November 2000
Alien: Resurrection," An Entertaining, Terrifying Sci-Fi.
","I had only seen one of the Alien movies before I saw Alien: Resurrection, which happened to be Alien3 , but I had heard lots about the ass-kicking series. Alien: Resurrection is not liked very much by critics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this flick, I own the film and watch it when I seriously need some horrifying stuff.Two centuries on from Alien3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lieutenant First Class, number 36706 is still very dead but Clone 8 - grown aboard the Auriga by the evil greedies at United Systems Military - looks damn near perfect (even if the only hair she has is her eyebrows when first we see her). From inside her, USM cut an Alien queen, then against the advice of General Perez (hairy-shouldered Dan Hedaya), let Ripley #8 live. She meets the six-strong vagabond crew of the Betty then USM's captive Aliens get smart and get free, chasing the crews through corridors (and flooded kitchens) until they die - or escape.Although the plot sounds fairly thin and silly, it is a strong story with a scary twist. The actors are all really good, Weaver puts in yet another excellent performance as Ripley, while newcomers to the series, Winona Ryder and Dan Hedaya, are both just as watchable. The screenplay is played out to ridiculous ends, which, in Alien: Resurrection's case, isn't actually a bad thing.If you like the Alien series and you're a big fan of sci-fi horror films, I highly recommend Alien: Resurrection.I rate Alien: Resurrection 7 out of 10.",7,1,1,23 November 2000
Blade," Get Those Fangs Into It...
","Blade looked like an intriguing idea from the adverts, so I decided I would follow my instincts and go and see it. Although Blade is not a great film, I certainly enjoyed myselfÂ…Meet Blade (Wesley Snipes). From the outset it's clear this is a troubled hero - a pre-credit sequence has him enter the world shortly after his mother's fatal encounter with a pointy-toothed demon of the night. Hardly your model birth. But every superhero has their dark side to wrestle with and being half-vampire just leaves you with an aggravating desire for meat cooked very, very rare. With a nifty serum suppressing such cravings and equipped with weaponry by grizzled armourer Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade launches a one-man crusade to rid the world of vampires, forsaking the classic cross and holy water combo for a more forthright reliance on weighty darts, bullets capped with garlic essence and a sword edged in silver.With an opening sequence to die for, it is certain Blade is going to be lots of fun. Wesley Snipes is perfect for his role, and Stephen Dorff is a superb villain. Kristofferson is also very watchable. The direction is enthralling, I look forward to see some more good stuff from Stephen Norrington in the future. The script is flawed but enjoyable, and the art direction is fascinating.Blade is a film you can really get your teeth (or should I say fangs?!) into, I recommend it for action fans who want a scare!I rate Blade 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,24 November 2000
The Mummy," Deeply Flawed.
","*Warning. There May Be Brief Spoilers.*My friend had recommended The Mummy to me, he told me it was an excellent flick. The Mummy is far from excellent. Even great or good is exaggerating. This film is a mess, it could of been a spectacular action flick if it wasn't let down by a disgustingly poor script and lots of acting flaws.The movie opens in Ancient Egypt, a voice over tells us the story of forbidden love between the scantily clad Pharaoh's wife and the high priest Imhotep. It is of course a story with a tragic end for the prohibited lovers as she is murdered and mummified and he is buried alive with an obscene amount of Scarab beetles to gnaw at his flesh. Cut to 1925 and O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and a group of legionnaires are fending off the remnants of the Ancient Pharaoh's Royal guards who have kept a pact over the centuries to keep Imhotep's tomb from being discovered. Confident that they have vanished all the intruders the guards retreat , unaware that Rick has inadvertently discovered their secret. Thus enuses copious amounts of adventure and Mummy gahs as our hero, now accompanied by Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), Jonathan (John Hannah) and a hoard of expendable extras resurrect the ancient evil and then run away and hide.The Mummy is sometimes an entertaining feature film, and it is a joy to watch Fraser try and do something a little less George-of-the-Jungle-ish, but, this is an extremely poor flick in the sense of how much quality and cleverness it provides.Prepare to be entertained during action sequences, but just take note, most audiences won't exactly be that spellbound  with The Mummy.I rate The Mummy 6 out of 10.",6,1,1,22 November 2000
Chicken Run," Hardly Anything To Dislike!
","Chicken Run was a total must-see for me because I love the Wallace and Gromit films, which were done by the same people, and filmed in the same way. Chicken Run impressed me just as much as W&G did!Ginger (Julia Sawalha) is the leader of a gang of chickens who are trying to break out of a Yorkshire chicken farm set in the 1950's. As the group of chicks continuously try to break out of their hatching-hell, more chickens are been taken into a machine to be made into chicken pies. Ginger and her gang are about to give up, but then an inspiring and decidedly sexy chicken named Rocky comes along and announces that he is able to fly. In a matter of time, Ginger realises Rocky is actually a runaway circus chicken. Ginger then demands to Rocky that he must teach them how to fly out of the Yorkshire farm or else Ginger's group will give his secret away.
There is basically nothing to dislike here, the voice-over performances are naturally astounding, the cinematography is breathtaking, the direction effort from Nick Park is some of the best I have seen all year and the screenplay is simply lovely. The way the film all strings itself together is just beautiful, and parents, teenagers or adults better think again if they think that Chicken Run is just a kids flick. No-siree. This film will impressive everyone who goes to see it, and if you do take an hour-and-a-half off your busy schedule to see Chicken Run, you won't regret doing so.Cute, cuddly and amazingly inventive, Chicken Run is one of the best films I have seen all year!I rate Chicken Run 9 out of 10.",10,0,0,2 December 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Magnificent.
","I had heard Sleepy Hollow was very good, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. One of the most spellbounding and best films ever constructed. This film is totally flawless, everything about it I loved.Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a small-town constable, is sent by his superior (Christopher Lee) to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of brutal murders, Crane arrives, appropriately enough on Halloween, and quickly learns that all the victims were found beheaded and their bonces never found, Ensconed in the home of Sleepy Hollow's finest, Baltus Van Tassell (Michael Gambon), Constable Crane is told the story of the Hessian Horsemen (a pointy-toothed Christopher Walken) - a former German mercenary who specialised in decapitating the locals during the War of American Independence. It is his ghost - the Headless Horseman - whom the locals believe is responsible for the killings. Crane believes nothing of the sort until he comes neck to neck with demonic being. In between fainting with fear, leering with desire at the Van Tassell's daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) and several more attacks from the headless one, Crane begins to uncover the true story behind the towns killer...Tim Burton, as usual, delivers stunning direction, and his film is easily his best one yet. The actors are all amazing, Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci have amazing on-screen chemistry. Emmanuel Lubezki's camerawork is immaculate, he deserved an Oscar for his amazing cinematography. The music is another stand-out for Sleepy Hollow, Danny Elfman's score is engaging.If you miss Sleepy Hollow, you'll miss out on what is probably one of the best films of the 20th century.I rate Sleepy Hollow 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,22 November 2000
The Beach," Very Enjoyable and Creative.
","The Beach isn't one of the most impressive films I have seen in 2000, but it is easy to call The Beach a very good film. And a great one wouldn't be exaggerating either.Leonardo DiCaprio is backpacker Richard, who thinks he's worldly-wise, but is so 'the young American abroad' when he seeks adventure and danger in Thailand. A strange encounter with crazed Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who rants of a perfect, secret beach, seems the travel tip for him. And he recruits a French girl he fancies rotten (Virginie Ledoyen) and her amiable boyfriend (Guillaume Canet) to join him on a mysterious, funny, scary journey to the spectacularly beautiful haven. There Sal (Swinton) holds sway over a community of drop-outs who are kind of a cross between the Swiss Family Robinson and an apocalyptic water sport cult. Although not one of the best films of 2000, The Beach is still an exotically engaging piece of work that results in the `Very, very good' column of filmmaking. Leonardo DiCaprio is electrifying as Richard, his performance lives long in the memory. DiCaprio is well supported by a largely unknown cast, Ledoyen, Swinton and Canet are all just as impressive. Danny Boyle once again gives us masterful directing effort, and the adaption from Alex Garland's novel wasn't bad, although it somehow loses its way towards the end.Overall, The Beach is a very recommendable Friday-nighter.I rate The Beach 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,24 November 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," Cute, Fun Entertainment.
","1999 was a year for dumb-ass teen films. Fortunately, 10 Things I Hate About You wasn't one of them, I, surprisingly, largely enjoyed this film.
10 Things I Hate About You focuses on cute, affluent sisters Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katarina (Julia Stiles), the former as sweet and popular as the latter is mean-spirited and sulky. Their dad (Larry Miller) has imposed a house rule that Bianca can't start dating until her older sis does - not the best news for besotted Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). In order to win the saccharine sophomore, he plots to find someone willing to date Kat - the ideal candidate being loner-with-past Patrick Verona (Aussie newcomer Heath Ledger) - and the inevitable sparks fly.I expected this to be just like She's All That and Drive Me Crazy, but this film is so cuddly, clever and cute that you can't help but have a blast watching it. The performances are great, Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger, both newcomers, have a marvellous on-screen chemistry and they have a promising future. All the characters are properly developed and the film paces itself brilliantly, therefore resulting as one of the better, more carefully worked out teen films of the year. There are faults, of course, the film is extremely predictable and some of the performers sometimes becoming annoying, but otherwise, this film is no less that a good, strong teen flick. Recommended for a bit of fun on a weeknight, mostly for teens, but larger audiences may also find this entertaining.I rate 10 Things I Hate About You 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,24 December 2000
Armageddon," Entertainment to the max!
","I wasn't that pleased with the other disaster flick, Deep Impact, which was released earlier than Armageddon, so I wasn't really expecting it to be all that good. Although it wasn't great, Armageddon entertained me to the max, which made it for me not to enjoy.At the obligatory scientific-military crisis conflab with NASA's director (Billy Bob Thornton) we get a refresher course in extermination events. This particular cosmic uh-oh, Asteroid Dottie, is the size of Texas and will hit planet Earth in 18 days, leaving not even a bacterium alive. Our only hope is for a rock rendezvous mission to drill a hole deep into the sucker and nuke it at the core. Hence the urgent need to locate 'the world's best deep-core driller'. Cue Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, a rowdy, globe-trotting maverick inspired by famed oil well firefighter Red Adair. Harry graciously agrees to save the world - like ya do - but only if he can take his own team with him. Enter a ragtag bag of roughneck, rambunctious and ex-criminal cowboys who include Harry's calm best buddy (Will Patton), a gigantic muscleman Ving Rhames lookalike (Michael Clarke Duncan), a Zen-babbling young dude Matthew McConaughey lookalike (Owen Wilson), the handsome reckless stud (Ben Affleck) - who's in love with Harry's gorgeous, headstrong daughter (Liv Tyler) - and a wisecracking weirdo genius geologist (it could only be Steve Buscemi).Armageddon gets more exciting, more intense every second, every minute. The actors are all fine, Bruce Willis is great as Harry, Ben Affleck is an excellent supporter and Liv Tyler is beautiful. She is the stand-out of Armageddon, her performance being Oscar-worthy and allÂ… The direction was also impressive, especially for a guy I have quite frankly never heard of! The only thing that needs a little work is the screenplay, which seems rushed at times, and silly at others.Armageddon is an entertaining, under-appreciated little gem which deserves praise.I rate Armageddon 7 out of 10.",7,2,3,23 November 2000
Pitch Black," A Gigantic Disappointment!
","I expected Pitch Black to be entertaining, fun and horrific. It was neither of them, and it has few good things about it.After a freak mishap, a spaceship crash lands on a desolate planet. The survivors include an escaped convict (Vin Deisel), his captor, and a bunch of devout Muslims among others. This unlikely collection of people have to team up together when they realise that the planet they have landed on not only has no water, but it is also infested with a bunch of nasty aliens intent on eating them. These aliens don't like the light, so it's a good job the system's three suns ensure 24 hours a day light ... or at least, that is, until a total eclipse arrives.This is basically an Alien clone done in a dumb-ass I've-seen-it-all-before style. There is one good performance from Diesel, who was given a poor script and crap, newcomer co-stars with no potential or future. There are no scary or tense scenes in the film, just a mix of moving shadows, slimy tenticles and objects going through people's stomachs, which isn't disgusting at all, just, embarrassing, try-hard horror. The use of colour is unwatchable and the cinematography is blurry and done in a boring way, unlike most horror films. The set decoration and art direction are neither bad, but they can barely save the film.Seriously not worth your time. You have been warned.I rate Pitch Black 2 out of 10.",3,0,1,25 December 2000
U-571," Horribly Inaccurate.
","*Warning: Spoilers*I was the only person in the cinema for U-571. I don't know why I saw it, but bad reviews and an empty cinema secured this movie as bad.While on a 48-hour leave from duty, Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), along with his crew, are stripped of their leave and given a new objective to follow. Their mission: to impersonate German soldiers, sneak their way onto the German u-boat U-571, and capture the Enigma, the decoder for the secret code tha is used by the Germans to search and sink opponent submarines. Their mission is a success, only until their own sub is destroyed and the US crew is trapped in a German sub in hostile waters. Now it is up to Tyler and his crew to make sure that the Enigma reaches the hands of the American authorities without allowing the Germans to realize that is has been stolen; otherwise, the mission is a failure.A question: what the hell was the point? The basic plot was that the dumb ass American's who expect to win a war by using a German U-boat. This tells you how clever the writing is, and how clever the entire film is going to be. There are two good performances from Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi were are strong and believeable, but the rest of actors let them down with embarrassing, clumsy performances. The direction and design are both stupid, you can actually see the end of the tanks, which is a big no-no.Disappointing, silly and corny - U-571 earns 3 points for good sound and impressive effects. McCoughaney better watch his back...I rate U-571 4 out of 10.",4,1,3,16 December 2000
American Beauty," Amazing.
","After winning five Oscars, I was intrigued to see American Beauty. After I finally caught it, I was sitting in my seat for about 10 minutes after the film had finished. It was hard for me to recover from such a masterpiece overflowing with brains and beauty.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) finds rebirth after his daughter's jailbait buddy Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) zings his long-buried sexual antennae. Immediately, he starts pumping iron, develops a range of taking-no-more-c**p retorts and drops out of his dronehead job to flip burgers at a local drive-through. Alongisde his frefall are his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening)'s more direct self-destruction and his estranged daughter Jane (Thora Birch)'s own sexual awakening.The story is plain and simple, but Ball's script is one of the most intelligent, engaging pieces of screen-writing I have seen for an extremely long amount of time. The performances are all perfect, Spacey and Bening got lots of credit, which they rightfully deserve; their performances been strong and powerful, but my personal favourite performance came from Thora Birch. She pulled off a stunning and real performance as the uniquely beautiful daughter Jane. Other stand-outs where Mena Suvari's Angela and Wes Bentley's Ricky.This movie is so brilliant, that, if you haven't actually seen it, you should be shot.  American Beauty, easily the best film of the past decade, secures a place on my top 5 films of all time.I rate American Beauty 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,22 November 2000
The Patriot," Big Disappointment.
","I expected this to be a good war film, and it had excellent reviews. Unfortunately, this wasn't to my taste. I wasn't pleased at all...Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a hero from a previous war, but having lost his wife and with seven children to look after, he is reluctant to get involved in the American war for independence. However when one of his children is killed in the conflict and his home is set on fire by the British, he reluctantly joins the Continentals in battle.He sets up his own militia army which brings fear to the British by fighting dirty and ambushing them in the woods rather than fighting them like gentlemen on the battlefields. Mel Gibson portrays Benjamin properly, and Heath Ledger is perfectly watchable, although he has chosen the wrong movie to start his 'blockbuster' career. The battle scenes are well-filmed and all, but the history is inaccurate and the story is a shambles, moving at the pace of a turtle's walk. This and Godzilla all tells us Roland Emmerich obviously has trouble making a good movie. This could've made up for his past mistakes, but it is an addition to his list of awful films.Over-long and boring at 160 minutes, The Patriot is an overrated and effortless attempt a blockbusting war film. I rate The Patriot 5 out of 10.",5,2,5,22 January 2001
Being John Malkovich," Unique, Memorable Piece of Filmmaking.
","I had wanted to see Being John Malkovich for a long time after seeing it was placed on the top 250, and that it had excellent A+ reviews.
John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, a straggly-haired, poverty-stricken puppeteer goaded by his animal-fixated wife (Cameron Diaz, almost unrecognisable under a gigantic brown wig) into getting a proper job, which he does, as a filing clerk on the seventh-and-a-half floor (a gag which really has to be seen) of a nondescript office building. It's here, while working for a dotty centenarian boss (Orson Bean) and lusting after colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener) that he stumbles upon the hidden portal that sucks unsuspecting parties straight into John Malkovich's brain, thus giving the person the opportunity to literally 'be' John Malkovich for 15 minutes, before being spewed out beside the New Jersey turnpike. But what starts out as a money-spinning novelty quickly descends into insanity, as Diaz discovers the joys of the portal, Keener discovers the joys of Malkovich, and Malkovich slowly begins to twig that a bunch of complete strangers are messing with his head.The acting is brilliant in Being John Malkovich, Cusack has rarely been better and Diaz hasn't done anything this amusing or creative in a long time. But it's Catherine Keener and John Malkovich who stand out the most here, Keener's performance is wickedly enjoyable, she deserved her Oscar nomination. And Malkovich, who really needed to get that Academy Award nomination over Michael Caine, is amazing, he pulls off the most superb performance of his career, playing himself. Spike Jonze is also a man I look forward to seeing more from, his direction skills are ironically fascinating. Charlie Kaufman's writing deserves an Oscar and a Golden Globe, because he has written the most original story I have ever seen in a film.At the end of Being John Malkovich, you'll be sitting there with your jaw dropped open because this film is such a mindblowing, intelligent ride. You'll never, ever see another film like this, so, for your own good, don't miss out.I rate Being John Malkovich 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,24 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Amazing
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had mixed reviews and I hadn't seen many non-english flicks before this. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it. Enjoyment is not quite the word for this film...breathtaking would be a more accurate description.Set in 19th century China, a 400 year old sword called the Green Destiny is given away as a present by Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), a legendary warrior. However, the same night it is stolen from its new owner by an impressive young female fighter who has been trained by the infamous Jade Fox. This leads Li Mu Bai and his companion on a quest to recover the sword and reveal the truth about the thief. It's simple - Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is flawless, making it easily the best foreign film ever made, the best action movie ever and simply one of the best flicks overall. The performances from the largely unknown cast shine, Chen Chang should be a sure Oscar contender, Michelle Yoeh is a great heroin and Chow Yun-Fat digests his character and is a very watchable main man. The visuals are amazing and literally breathtaking, every minute of the movie I just had to remind my heart to keep pumping the blood around. Ang Lee is simply one of the most assuring directors around, this is his best film by a long shot, but all his films are crowd-pleasing and all demand continuous viewings.Incredible, intriguing, memorable and utterly brilliant, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a deluxe achievement.I rate Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,30 January 2001
The Insider," Intriguing and Clever. Worth a Look.
","After getting nominated for 7 Academy Awards, I was dying to see The Insider. Well, I must say, I was basically blown away by how much effort went into this film, and it is very recommendable.Based on a magazine article, The Insider follows the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), head of a tobacco company's Research And Development department, who discovers that the fag companies have for years not only known that nicotine was addictive, but worse, they've been messing around with the formula to make it even more so. After being persuaded to give a TV interview by producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino Pacino), Wigand discovers that smoking is deeply bad for your health, even if you've never lit a gasper in your life. Harassment, death-threats, a possible prison sentence and a collapsed marriage are a few of the ordeals that Wigand is put through -all, it would appear, to no avail when squabbling at CBS' 60 Minutes news programme leads them to ditch the programme, much to Bergman's horror.Some powerhouse performances here, Al Pacino is corker as Bergman, but New Zealander Russell Crowe pulls off the most impressive act in the film, therefore earning himself an Oscar nomination. Michael Mann, director of Heat, has assured direction here, he knows what he's doing, and he does it well, his script for The Insider is also well thought-out and amazingly clever. The only faults there may be here is the fact that The Insider could be a big bore for some audiences, but for me, it was an enthralling experience.A well done film, definitely worth your time.I rate The Insider 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,20 December 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," A Fulfilling, Moving Experience.
","Definitely not just a 'chick flick', Girl, Interrupted is an underrated little gem. Perhaps the best mental-hospital movie since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.Winona Ryder is Susanna, a 60's sensitive type who commits herself to a mental institution after she takes a bottle of aspirin to cure a headache. We are then introduced to the inmates who will quickly form Susanna's clique: Daisy (Brittany Murphy), an anorexic daddy's girl; Polly (Elisabeth Moss), whose horrifically scarred face masks her innate sensitivity; and Lisa (Jolie), a free-spirited sociopath who has turned asylum escapes into an artform. Of course, the girls bond (though never in a sickly way), and have 'adventures' (midnight bowling, sneaking a peek at their psychiatric reports); yet this is never as cute as you might think, director Mangold always injecting the proceedings with a slight, distinctly anti-Tinseltown edge.The performances are incredible, Winona Ryder is at her best, Britanny Murphy pulls off a strong, believeable appearance as Daisy and Whoopi Goldberg is typically great. But, here, Angelina Jolie is the real sparkle. Girl, Interrupted is HER movie, and it bought her into stardom, she won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her moving, memorable performance as Lisa. Director James Mangold's direction is cruelly underrated, his effort is extremely impressive. The script is thought provoking and excellent, Mangold again is underrated, while his co-writers Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan aren't bad at all.Girl, Interrupted results as a must-see drama, well worth your time.I rate Girl, Interrupted 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,20 December 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Brutally Brilliant.
","A Clockwork Orange was probably the first Stanley Kubrick film I ever saw. Well, it made me want to see more of Stan the man's movies and I'm glad I did.The film is about a violent teenager, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), of the 'future' (i.e. a dated 1970s view of the future) who goes on a brief rampage before being captured by the police. He then volunteers to take part in a scientific experiment to change his behaviour - the result is that he is transformed into a 'normal' person. He then goes around and sees the wrongs that he has done to his former victims.A Clockwork Orange is held together by incredible direction from Stanley Kubrick, a brilliant and memorable performance from Malcolm McDowell and a haunting screenplay. Although brutal, the world of Stanley Kubrick remains a completely stunning one, all his stories and films are remarkable, and this is easily one of his best ever. Everything about it is just so ... excellent. It takes your breath away.A Clockwork Orange is a remarkable film that deserves all the praise it gets, then some more. A masterpiece.I rate A Clockwork Orange 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,7 January 2001
Scream 2," Killer Sequel!
","I thought Scream was a masterpiece, so, naturally, I wanted to see Scream 2 and I expected it to be just as good. Although it was far from a masterpiece, Scream 2 is just as much fun as the first movie.It's two yeas after the gruesome Woodsboro murders and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is enjoying a new life, a new boyfriend and new friends as a student at heavenly Windsor College. But that was before the opening night of 'Stab', the movie account of the horrific slayings at Woodsboro, based on the best-selling book written by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Now a 'copycat killer' is one the rampage and wants Sidney dead, again. As the body count rises the pressure becomes unbearable. No one is safe, and everyone is a suspect.The great performers return from the first film - Neve Campbell is brilliant as Sidney, and Jamie Kennedy reprises his role as geek Randy perfect and David Arquette and Courteney Cox, who where rudely underused in the original, deserve credit for their more-developed characteristics. Wes Craven returns to the director's seat again, and he puts lots of effort into this killer sequel. Also, great writer Kevin Williamson reminds us how good sequel-scripts can get.A must-see for fans of the original!I rate Scream 2 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,16 December 2000
Bring It On," Entirely Recommendable For All Audiences.
","Bring It On was one of my many must-see's of the year 2000. Well, I must say, I was definitely not let down by this almost brilliant teen cheerleader flick!Torrence (Kirsten Dunst) is the new captain of a San Diego high school cheerleading team, which has won the National Championships several years on the row. Torrence is thinking they are all going great until the team discovers that its routines have been stolen from an inner-city Los Angeles school. This means that they only have a limited amount of time to come up with a new routine in order to save their embarrassment.Kirsten Dunst was marvellous as Torrence and Jesse Bradford was a nice, charming romantic touch, but he screws his face around too much. Overall, not just for acting, Eliza Dushku was the real star. She is an underestimated actress who has done extremely well in Buffy, The Vampire Slayer and this very film, she's sexy, she's deadly, and she's one of the most talented young actresses around today. It's not just the acting or the cute script that manage to impress, but a bunch of memorable one-liners like `That's alright, that's okay, you're gonna pump our gas someday!' and `Your ass is so big it could make it's own website' also manage to win the day.Hilarious, fun, enjoyable, clever and unpredictable Ã‚â€“ Bring It On is an entirely recommendable experience for any audience.I rate Bring It On 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,5 January 2001
Scream," Masterful.
","I hadn't heard much about Scream, surprisingly, so I didn't even know what I was going to see. When I realised it was about murderers, I was deeply surprised and very intrigued...Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has alot on her plate. It's hard enough to be a teenager, coming of age in today's world, let alone have a boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) with raging hormones, a father whose life is one business trip after another, and still feel healthy when your mother was brutally murdered one year ago. Just when things seem to be getting back to normal for Sidney and her friends, the small town is once again plagued by a killer. Someone who is taking their love of scary movies one step too far. To survive they must follow the golden movie rules - don't answer the door, don't leave the house, don't answer the phone, but most of all, don't SCREAM.Scream is one of those movies you can watch day in, day out and never stop loving. The performances are fine, Neve Campbell is the perfect heroin, while Drew Barrymore plays Casey Becker in her gory opening scene to perfection and Skeet Ulrich is perfect for the part of creepy Billy Loomis. Kevin Williamson is a marvellous writer, his 'do you like scary movies?' terrorising plot is amazingly convincing. And, of course, Wes Craven has done it again...A total classic, Scream fulfills in all areas.I rate Scream 10 out of 10.",9,0,0,16 December 2000
The Iron Giant," Exquisite.
","The Iron Giant is a critically acclaimed piece of animated cinema. I wasn't expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.The Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.The Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking. Please, for the love of God, make your life better and see this brilliant film.I rate The Iron Giant 10 out of 10.",Null,77,96,22 November 2000
Final Destination," Creative, Intelligent Fun.
","I had heard Final Destination was the best teen horror film since Scream. Although that may not be exactly correct, I still enjoyed myself during this intelligent and fierce thriller.Death has a plan and Alex (Devon Sawa) has ruined it. After having a premonition the flight he and his school group are about to take will explode in mid air, he tries to warn everyone. Of course no one believes him and with a handful of classmates, he is thrown off the plane before it takes off. When the plane bursts apart just after take off, Alex realises he has cheated death Â– and now it's time for payback. One by one, the survivors begin to die in horrific, mysterious circumstances. Now that Alex has figured Death's plan, can he do anything to alter the destiny that awaits him?Final Destination isn't a bad film. In fact, its pretty darn good. The performances are impressive, Devon Sawa possibly gave his best performance, while Dawsons Creek actor Kerr Smith gives a smartly evil role as Carter. Also Ali Larter, Chad Donella and Sean William Scott are very good performers for this horror flick. The script is very original, writer Glen Morgan deserves praise for his abilities on the keyboard. I love the deaths, they are very creative, and the direction is full of effort.Although slightly sometimes Final Destination can be slightly overrated, I highly recommend it for an audience who want to have a scarily funny good time.I rate Final Destination 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,15 December 2000
The Matrix," One of the best science fiction films in a long time!
","The first time I saw The Matrix, I thought it was such tosh that I didn't even bother to watch all of it. When I came on Cable TV, I decided I would give it another go. I watched the whole thing, and I was thoroughly impressed! I think The Matrix is one of those movies were it must be seen twice to be understood, and to be liked.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a bit of a slacker, selling illegal software on the side under the pseudonym 'Neo' to finance his computer hardware needs. He wants to find someone called Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). He's searching for the answer to a question. He has no idea where the question came from. But the urge to discover 'What is the Matrix?' will lead him to places where nothing is what is seems and to people who hope he is The One...Although over-hyped, The Matrix is a largely entertaining sci-fi thriller with an attitude. The action sequences are stunning, the sound is immaculate and the acting is very watchable, Fishburne in particular is amazing as Morpehus.Overall, I strongly recommend The Matrix. It is a stunning, clever and unique thriller with style.I rate The Matrix 8 out of 10.",9,0,0,22 November 2000
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Something I Really Got My Teeth Into!
","*Warning: Possible Spoilers*Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles made a great book. No one knew what to expect from the film. Well, this well-made, clever, intriguing story is far better than anyone had the right to expect.The film kicks off in modern day San Francisco where the 200-year-old vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) begins to relate the story of his life to a young interviewer (Christian Slater). It is a tale that begins with the death of plantation owner Louis' wife and child back in New Orleans in the late 18th Century, an event that, for Louis, effectively marks the end of his human existence. The arrival, thereafter, of a vampire called Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers him an escape from his terminable grief with the outside chance of immortality. Yet, as Louis comes to learn, this grief ultimately pales into insignificance compared with the pain that comes as a consequence of having to slaughter humans in order to feed. Initially he resists, drawing sustenance from rats and other animals, before he succumbs to his condition and sinks his teeth into Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a young orphan. Refusing to let her die, Lestat instead fashions her into Louis' companion, and thus Claudia becomes his surrogate daughter/lover, a child-woman who remains shackled within the body of a young girl while her brain and appetites grow.Eventually Louis and Claudia plot to kill their maker, and having escaped Lestat, they travel to Europe in search of fellow blood-suckers and meet Armand (Antonio Banderas) and many more at the Theatre Des Vampires in Paris.Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is a film I could really get my teeth (or should I say fangs?) into. The performances are excellent, particularly from the young Kirsten Dunst and the outstanding Brad Pitt in one of his best roles. Although Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas are underused slightly, they are still impressive in their juicy roles. The editing is very good and the story is well-adapted from the excellent book.Simply fang-tastic!I rate Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles 8 out of 10.",9,2,3,1 January 2001
