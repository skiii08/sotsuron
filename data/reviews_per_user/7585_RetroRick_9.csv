Hereditary," the kids aren't all right
","A movie that divides people in the way that this film does is typically a good sign but in this case the issue probably goes deeper than 'you'll either love or hate it'. This is a film you either will or won't invest in, and that will partly be about your expectations about what a horror film is; what a horror film should or shouldn't be. I suspect that many who dislike it will simply object to the emotional cost of entry: it isn't pleasant or fun for the most part, and while the film certainly has its forerunners neither is it clear what the rules are, or indeed what the genre is. That in itself is unsettling and no doubt intentionalThose who end invest will find themselves buying into what is an exquisite nightmare that gets worse by every turn. I was going to say it moves inexorably towards its conclusion. I'm not entirely sure whether it does. Once it arrives the end will either leave you gob-smacked or dissatisfied. It is only at that point perhaps that it is clear what the film is, and where it's comparisons are to be found. Quite a few on these boards have compared have compared this to the exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. Personally I think only the latter is an appropriate comparison, but while that film is a work of brilliance in many ways Hereditary goes further. There is none of the cosiness of the former film. No sense that evil might be fun, a club that might have exclusive benefits worth the price of admission. Yet oddly and disturbingly it is only at this conclusion, the apogee of the nightmare rather than its dissipation that there is anything like repose. I'm not sure this is a film that everyone or even most people will enjoy, and for that reason it might be worth thinking about whether its your cup of tea before you buy the tickets. Much of it is unpleasant rather than scary and the subject matter is uncomfortable to say the least. The story involves the destruction of a family and there is nothing in that that will make you feel good, however it does create the conditions for the cast to do some wonderful acting. All of the cast are good but the standout performance is most definitely Toni Colette's. Her scene at the bereavement encounter group was just so good and effortlessly natural and I struggle to think of any other actress who could have pulled off her part so well. Personally I think Frances McDormand, in comparison is over-rated and Collette acts the latter under the table in this film. I really do hope she gets recognition for this role.Did I like it? I'm not sure. Probably no, but I do think it was very good, and presents some fine innovation in terms of refreshing the horror genre. It is overlong, and slow for much of the first half of the film, but the momentum gets going in the second half",8,3,6,23 August 2018
Knives Out," Lower your expectations & you'll enjoy, raise them too much & you'll be disappointed
","Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn't good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it's difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don't always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it's quite good, it isn't that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn't work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn't clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I'll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I'd have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston's Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I'd venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though",6,145,264,6 January 2020
Deadpool 2," people in glass houses etc
","It just saddens me that this film is so highly rated. There were parts of it I enjoyed but not that many. The tie-in with the X-men world worked for a while because of deadpool's looser sense of ethics, and the reduced circumstances of his - and the kid's incarceration in mutant prison almost makes him vulnerable enough to care about, but none of that lasts, and for the majority - and after those events - remainder of the film, we find ourselves in the presence of someone who not only won't die, but - and of course it is his trade-mark - won't shut up. All superheroes are effectively immortal, but there is something about deadpool's unkillability that really destroys any tension in this movie, and unfortunately it is all done quite deliberately. In most superhero movies we know that that the (super)hero must survive but somehow also worry about them. With deadpool though everything is an in-joke, and that includes the fact that superheroes - deadpool at least - are indestructable, and the movie plays with that endlessly. There is at least one funny scene that arises out of this (consequent to his meeting the monster in the prison basement) but for the most part it simply means we don't care about what happens in the way that we normally would and since the writers appear to anticipate this we are treated instead to endless knowing jokes about his desire to die. The intention seems to be to try to make deadpool into some kind of existentially tragic figure - but unlike say groundhog day, where unkillability becomes a metaphor for sameness of every day, the writers completely fail in this respect. Deadpool's loss (of a loved one) and motivation never seem real, and when he somehow finds a mission in the redemption of one of the characters in the movie it just doesn't seem like something he'd actually do. 
 
There's also the politics of the film. Leaving aside the PC aspect (which is pretty much universal these days) there's also something disturbing about the hate figures in the film. The people who run the 'ophanage' in the fim are thinly disguised religious bigots, and not only the main 'preacher' like head of the institution but all of its staff - who are likened to paedo philes - are simply despatched as token 'haters'. Given the controversies surrounding some of the people who made the x-men films themselves there is something slightly ironic about this - people who live in glass cages shouldn't ....etc.. That's not to say the mutant hating bigots aren't to be faulted, but that we shoiuld perhaps be a little wary about taking our morality from anything as ethically warped as deadpool, a man who though he can't be killed or effectively injured despatches legions of bad guys more in offence than defence, and typically in nasty and fundamentally unfair ways. In fact at times, particularly at the beginning, deadpool as a superhero feels like the cinematic version of shooting, stabbing, hacking and decapitating fish in a barrel.
I just find everything about this film immature and fake. However it probably does know its audience, who from the ratings would appear to like being force fed dubious easter eggs, not to mention hollywood politics and morality. In truth I'm probably just too old for this kind of film, but at the same time I kind of feel so should anyone older than a teenager",4,158,345,19 August 2018
Elf," Big Sugar Rush of a film
","Elf is a film that will inevitably divide the critics. Some may consider it the greatest christmas movie ever made whereas others will scoff and declare it the greatest movie ever made in any genre. I mean why shouldn't a christmas movie be right at the top. It's vastly more entertaining that snoozefest Citizen (Candy) Kane for instance, and so is the acting and the story. I know I'm not declaring like for like but Elf is just....betterAnd it's all thanks to Will Ferrell. The supporting cast are great, especially Grinchy old James Cahn and brassy Zoey Deschanel the tough as nails new york princess who we see suddenly and completely disarmed by Ferrell's absolute innocent abroad. Who says girls are attracted to boys on Santa's naughty list?And seriously who wouldn't want to discover that sugar addicted Will Ferrrell in an Elf's costume is actually their long lost and unknowingly begotten son? Ferrel is simply the only person I could imagine pulling this off. He's fantastic in this role, slowly conquering New York, probably the most cynical city in the world, with a palpable sense of pure joy and the kind of energy normally reserved for a brand new puppy. Gritty compelling cinema.",10,0,3,19 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," occasionally, very occasionally, reminds us of proper star wars
","As an ending to what could have been the greatest science fiction franchise ever, this is a major disappointment. I hated the first half, but was pulled in somewhat in the second part, mainly because Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is kind of intriguing, at least compared to the rest of the cast. When he's around, the film almost seems like it might become proper star wars, and that despite the fact that for part of it he ponces around in the silliest Sith suit you could imagine. Whoever thought that red streaked helmet looked cool should be summarily fired from their job.Kylo Ren inherit's the film's tradition of quasi-oedipal conflict. Motivation wise, it's not quite clear what's going on, but we know his past, who he's killed (actually I needed a reminder) and his precarious relationship with both the dark & light sides of the force & it's representative in this incarnation of the star wars universe. If only because of Driver the dreadful first half gives way to a second half that at times actually feels like proper star wars.Unfortunately it never quite pulls it off. The story bitty & far from compelling. Rey seems like a nice girl but she's just too bland to really care. It's not Daisy Ridley's fault. She's not at all objectionable, but there is simply nothing remotely exceptional about her. As a Skywalker, she should have been a re-tread or reworking of the Luke story, the wonder of which was a bored teenager trodden down by his workaday life who suddenly finds himself swept into a galaxy spanning story of epic proportions as the key player. Technically Rei was designed along the same lines, except there was never even a remote sense of her really being swept up from the mundane in in the same way as with Luke. This is entirely the fault of the writers & a perfect example of why progressive writers with agendas really do their pet projects absolutely no favours: by making her far too powerful almost from the get-go in the very first film, they simply broke the character & plot development that was essential for her to become the pivotal character she is supposed to be.We are never remotely worried she will fail. At anything. Because she's far, far too powerful. There is a scene at the very end where - not to give too much away - she appears out-matched albeit very briefly - but it is so out of sorts for her character it seems really odd? There's someone more powerful than Rei? That can't be.There is some attempt at character development on the part of Rey, insofar there is the ever so slightest suggestion that she might be toying with the dark side, but we never really believe it & after three whole films it's clear that as the central character of this final trilogy she never quite makes it as a character we believe in. This is compounded by the fact that all of those with Jedi powers in this film, i.e. both jedi & Sith are suddenly imbued with vastly amplified powers, something which just makes all the rest of the action, not really seem to matter that much. Jedis are supposed to represent the power of the force, sure, but they are not supposed to be virtual Gods.As for the rest of the cast, they are not really alive in the same way as the original characters, or even those of the prequels. John Boyega is ok, but after 3 movies I still care nothing about the guy flying the Millenium Falcon, not even to look up his name, and when - spoiler - he suddenly ascends to a top rebel commander rank, it just seems odd & jarring.There are few good set pieces, the best of which features the broken form of the fallen death star from the very first film (or possibly the third, I'm not sure), now but a wreck in a very tempestuous sea. This is probably the point where the film feels most like Star Wars, and it's not coincidental that this is where we encounter the film's central (& arguably most climactic) conflict, where both Kylo Ren & Rey get to work on their inner demons, such as they are.At this point it looks like the film, after a dire first half, could really redeem itself and provide a real conclusion. Unfortunately, it's unable to sustain the improvement. We are soon presented with the final conflict, unsurprisingly the final conflict between the evolved first order, now re-made as the Final Order & the still ramshackle rebel alliance. It's a shame but it isn't well done. We encounter the Emperor Palpatine once more, but now he seems increasingly like a pantomime character & the final conflict that occurs both above & below, above in the form of the clash of the imperial fleet versus the ragtag rebels & below between the adults - the jedi & the sith - working out their differences - never seems properly balanced in the way it once would have been. If you think back to the original star wars film, & the tension, the sheer impossible odds involved in the a no-hoper farm boy from Alderaan firing the killer shot that destroys the entire death star, and compare that to the pedestrian, go through the motions foxy boxing that we get here (I'm exaggerating a bit, some of it's ok I suppose), it's hard not to rue what a wasted opportunity this was.",6,3,7,4 April 2020
Bad Teacher," mildly amoral, refreshingly different.
","Am reviewing this to counter-balance the far too many negative reviews out there. This is a funny, not hilarious, but funny and sometimes cruel film about a bad teacher, who is funny because she is bad. Just like bad santa she isn't being held up an examplar for teaching or a role-model for young women (actually I'm not too sure about that). What she is is an anti-dote to the righteous, touchy-feely, moralising lesson preaching,heart-in-the-right-place films that normally dominate this genre, or at least do whenever there is a female in the lead. God knows the world would suffer if every film was like this, but a little bit of gentle cynicism is good thing in a world that is full of fraudulent fictional xmas cheer. Spoiler: As for the sensitive little boy not getting the girl, isn't about time that movies stopped lying to teenage boys that being nice & sensitive will get you laid.",Null,39,64,7 October 2011
Avengers: Endgame," downbeat, overblown & so so long. Cuts all your favourite characters down to size
","Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I were a real Marvel fanboy, although from reading the other reviews I might well have cause to doub that, but as someone coming to this film through all the hype, and the knowledge that this has just outgrossed Avatar in terms of the box office I am simply astonished how lacklustre this film is.Sometimes I dislike a film, and rail against it while secretly having quite enjoyed it, the objection being to some aspect of the film which annoyed me, maybe something ideological or political. But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up. Ultimately what is the point of a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?This is just a bad overblown movie that seems to take pleasure in down-sizing it's heroes in anticipation of a new greatly diminished future",3,80,132,3 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," a not always gentle hommage to Sharon Tate & a former hollywood
","I did enjoy this film, despite its length, probably because I didn't expect it to be earth-shatteringly brilliant. DiCaprio & Pitt are as good as ever. It's not either's best role but they're always watchable & good company, particularly in a film which involves strolling through so much of Hollywood history.As some point out there isn't that much of a story going on with the male leads. DiCpario plays a fairly successful TV/film star whose career might or might not be about to go down the pan, while Pitt is his stunt man, driver & friend. We get to see them go about their daily lives & careers & although DiCaprio's actor has his ups & downs most of what happens is just portraiture.One notable & controversial scene involves Brad Pitt's character besting an insufferable Bruce Lee. Why Taranantino chose to show Lee in such an unflattering light is unclear, but I suspect it has to do with something close to the heart of the film, which is something akin to revisionism, Bruce Lee & at least one other 'real character' is subject to some major critical re-assessment in this film, something which with respect to the other personage, & in light of the speculative nature of that re-assessment, is done rather obliquely, presumably so as to skirt anything too overtly libellous.Though we spend most of the time in the company of Leo & Brad (a man known around town for having got away with the murder of his wife) the real heart of the film is of course about the impending catastrophe that we know is approaching in the house next door to where DiCaprio's actor lives on Cielo Drive.This foreknowledge of what must be brings a real poignancy to every scene featuring Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate, the young actress (& wife of absent director Roman Polanski) who was so brutally murdered along with former boyfriend Jay Sebring & some others on 8th August 1969.I don't want to say too much about this, except to say that in many ways the central conceit of the film in relation to this amounts to a what-if twist on the idea that maybe the killers did go to the wrong house that night.What Tarantino does with this, is, in a small way, kind of ingenious. Robbie's Sharon Tate is portrayed as an innocent, full of joy for life, revelling, in the right way, in her success, even though she isn't quite a household name. Tarantino clearly had a soft spot for his leading lady Uma Thurman, & it's hard not to imagine him feeling something similar for Margot Robbie, who, in this film, is the centre of every scene she is in, ethereally captivating in that particular sixties/seventies way. Except it might not ultimatley be Robbie who Quentin's obsessed with but the Sharon Tate herself, both her story, tragically abbreviated, but also the possibility of a kind of justice, something which strangely we witness delivered somehow in the closing sequences of the film.A part of this justice perhaps, is in a third Tarantino re-assessment, that of the murderous Manson family itself. Oddly, Charlie himself, makes but one very brief entrance. All other encounters with the family are overloaded with mockery & contempt. Margaret Qualley's youth buys her some slack, but for the rest of them, they are portrayed as fundamentally weak, cowardly, envious, & in equal measure both predatory & incompetent. There's a reckoning due in this film for such people, & with Tarantino in charge of delivering justice, one can rest assured it isn't going to be pretty.Altogether a fine return to form for Tarantino, if rather too long, but not at all surprising that's it's divided so many reviewers",8,0,1,11 May 2020
Joker," Actual cinema for a change. Compelling film with a compelling performance by Phoenix
","This film looks likes and is ...cinema. I really didn't think they that any more. it's probably due to the setting in a grim but intensely real Gotham City, which has never been more like a truly unattractive new york (without the landmarks of course).Joachim Phoenix is understated but mesmerising. Fundamentally vulnerable for much of the movie, his becoming is slow but inexorable. He won't be become quite the Joker you're used to, but be assured he will become the Joker, one with a great deal more depth than we've had before.In a sense that's part of why the film's met with some mixed critical responses. Some of the critical voices have been quite vocal in condemning not the film so much as the 'wrong message' they feel it conveys. While the film certainly doesn't glamorise the violence in the Joker, since it explains it from the inside, it does make us sympathise fundamentally with the character, a rare feat given that he is portrayed as an abused, socially awkward, mentally ill loner, the kind who society mainly hears about when like in the Joker they decide to do something to be remembered by. The fear being articulated in other words is that the film with it's portrayal of a cathartic explosion of violence by the socially rejected will inspired others to follow.People sometimes are inspired by films to act out, in good ways and bad, but fears like that seem misplaced & betray one of the worst aspects of modern movie-making, namely, that much of it seems to involve very conscious efforts at social control. Angry loners have been doing angry loner things for a long time and an actual study into why human explosions do happen, the discovery of what it's like to be on the other side of the glass so to speak, probably isn't going to make things much better or worse, except insofar as understanding people and what makes them tick, what makes them angry or sad etc is generally something which makes the world better rather than worse.Moreover the issues also touches on one of the reasons the movie works: because so much of our entertainment & media is made with a conscious awareness of what kind of effect it's supposed to have, what sort of message we, in other words, are supposed to get, we are increasingly left with what often feels like synthetic experiences, involving synthetic feelings, where we are supposed to feel angry or happy, agree or disagree etc on cue. The Joker avoids this kind of socially responsible paint by numbers cinema and for that reason, almost bizarrely given that it's a Batman origin movie within a comic book superhero genre, it feels real, fundamentally authentic.Whether the film makes the world a better or worse place remains to be seen, but ultimately, movies are only supposed to make the world a better place because they are works of art or vision or something approaching that. Having said that many great works of cinema really have been politically or socially subversive & there probably is something of that in this film too. Not only do we have a controversial hero/anti-hero but we also have his identification with the little guy (literally in one scene) within the context of the depiction of social anger & mass uprising against the rich, that more than a little seems to evoke the barely covered by the news mass protests in france for instance, not to mention populist feeling articulated against out of touch 'elites' within the wider international political system.The depiction in places of quasi-revolutionary violence, which in the context of the Batman universe, we have always previously been led to believe was a case of simple thuggery & criminality, does a great deal to turn our perception of things upside down. In this sense the film really is a departure from what we are familiar with. With the humanization of the Joker comes by implication something like a destabilization of the essential goodness of his opponents, if not Batman himself - who as yet doesn't quite exist - then of the plutocrat class Batman represents, which here is ingeniously symbolized by the somewhat ambivalent, but certainly not sympathetic figure of Bruce Wayne's old man.In many ways this sets up potential for good things to come. We already know Bruce Wayne's anger and now we have discovered the source of the Joker's too. Whether Phoenix's Joker will ever meet an adult batman remains to be seen. It probably won't happen, but it would certainly be something to behold",10,2,3,8 October 2019
