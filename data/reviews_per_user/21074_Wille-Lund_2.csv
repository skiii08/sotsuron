The Avengers," Great effects, too funny.
","When i went to the theaters to see this movie I was really excited, I've wanted in 6 months for it to have its release, what i had seen in trailers was something of the best I had seen in movie effects way, and when the movie was finished, and I walked out of the theaters it was the same thing, maybe the movie with the best effects ever, but i wasn't really pleased with what i had seen, the actors are good, the story is okay and the effects are exploding of course, but it's not what I want the avengers to be really, I mean of course you break all the records with that actors and that trailers, but thats just a question about money. it's an action-comedy, and when 9-year old kids around me laughs their heads off every other minute, its not really that feeling you want to have when you watch a superhero movie, the whole movie has received very good critics, though it's only the visual effects that deserves it! I'm one of the few people who didn't add this to their all-time-favorite list, but actually the movie doesn't have much more then an amazing visual effects job, that does the movie pretty entertaining. that's what I think, 7 of 10 isn't bad, but with harder work on the story, it could be a 9-10.",7,6,13,12 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Wow...Nolan!
","The Dark Knight Rises, The third and last part of an amazing trilogy.BOM! the music is brilliant, I love that last second when the movie theater experience that last 'BOM' and the big screen showing 'The Dark Knight Rises' and you know this is it, this is the end of an fantastic trilogy.In the beginning of the movie, Bruce Wayne or Batman has not been seen since that night 8 years ago, the night of Harveys death, but when a masked man starts to move around in Gotham, it's also time for Bruce Wayne to put the mask on again.For the last part Nolan decided that Bane is the final villain. Bane who challenges Batman both mentally and physically, which makes the choice of villain obvious to the final part of the trilogy,also a smart choice of actor to play the muscle monsters. Tom Hardy! Tom Hardy got a tough challenge with the role of Bane, I mean the bar was set pretty high when Heath Ledger did a extraordinary performance as The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' But can you really do Bane so much better? The way he talks, walks and fights, Tom Hardy is perfect for the role of Bane.And as we know from the two previous movies Christian Bale does a fantastic performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman.Yeah, actually I'm very pleased with all the actors, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and so on.Bane is presented early in the film, in a very big scene in the air where his plan is to 'crashing this plane, with no survivors' and from there you know what Batman will face.A fantastic trilogy deserves a fantastic ending.Thanks Nolan!",10,13,27,26 July 2012
