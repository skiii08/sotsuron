Requiem for a Dream," Intense
","I watched this film last night after seeing it on IMDb. It kinda sounded like the type of movie i would enjoy, however, it turned out to be one of those rare movie experiences that made me feel exhausted and speechless. the film was beautiful and traumatic all at the same time, the direction was fantastic and was cinema in the true sense of the word. If you have empathy and understanding of addiction you will really feel for the characters and if you don't, this movie will challenge your beliefs to their core. This is a non-safe movie which will guarantee that it acquires it's haters , but it's the safe, same old, same old movies that will not live long in the memory, where as Requiem for a dream will be here forever. If you are open minded and enjoy unique films, i highly recommend this film to you and you will love it. 10/10 along with pulp fiction and City of god",10,0,0,5 August 2008
