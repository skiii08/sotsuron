50 First Dates," No.. just no.
","I most definitely preferred Adam Sandler when he was doing movies like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and even Eight Crazy Nights. This is a romantic comedy, and like nearly all romantic comedies, has extremely cheesy moments. The only things that save this movie from disgrace are Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, and the person who played Sandler's coworker. These 3 characters are pretty damn funny. Besides that, this movie is not worth the time and money it takes. 5/10",Null,1,2,14 February 2004
