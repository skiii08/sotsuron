Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A one-time-ain't-enough-movie
","I saw the movie now four times and I still want to see it again! In my opinion it's the best movie of the Star Wars family! Of course it has great special effects and more action than the others, but it also has a complex plot! I'm ashamed to tell, that I first realized why it's called 'The Phantom Menace' after the third time I saw it! I guess you have to see it a few times to realize all the details and symbols in this film. If you already have, you can imagine what's in the next Episode. But you can only imagine! You don't know exactly, so you keep thinking and building your own Episode II and that's why I like this movie!",Null,0,0,26 July 1999
