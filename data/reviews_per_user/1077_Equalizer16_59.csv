Blade Runner 2049," Only Denis Villeneurve
","30 years after Ridley Scott's sci fi masterpiece, Denis Villeneuve astoundingly brings the epic classic back to the screen in a perfect sequel to the mind bending dystopian thriller.In the year 2049, the Wallace corporation dominates the Nexus industry in producing new 'Replicants' with complete obedience, now a new Blade Runner: K, (Ryan Gosling) pursues the surviving Nexus 8 replicants, but unravels a shattering mystery.After the tense drama of Prisoners, soul stirring atmosphere of Sicario, and immense experience of Arrival, learning that Villeneuve was going to direct the Blade Runner sequel, there was no other director who could take on the job, and the long awaited film is confirmation of that truth. It is clear that Villeneuve has great passion for the Scott's work, which is shown through the sensational craft of Blade Runner 2049.The critical significance about Blade Runner is its eerie arty atmosphere unlike any science fiction thriller. Its not a action packed blockbuster, its a steady thought provoking neo noir. Villeneuve absolutely understands this and has continued this course remarkably in the sequel. What Villanueva and writer Hampton Fancher successfully produce is a progressing exploration into the stirring narratives of what it means to be alive and memory that drove the first film. Carrying more heart wrenching depth into these matters, 2049 provokes stronger spirit into the concept of Blade Runner. As the story of humans and replicants progresses more mind boggling and moving threads are revealed in this next chapter.The most marvellous achievement of 2049 is the breath-taking scenery of the same dark dystopian Los Angeles in sensational colour schemes exhibiting the amazing realism of the Blade Runner world. So many moments of beautiful set pieces and design show the wonderful art that cinema really is, furthermore presented through the enchanting cinematography of Roger Deakins. A perspective into the Blade Runner world identical to the first vision in magnificent presence of vibrating terrain. From the towering lens flare city buildings in L.A, to the desolate orange wastelands of Las Vegas.Of course one of the most memorable traits of the first film was Vangelis's shivering yet absorbing score, which again is brilliant revived through the work of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfirsch replicating (no pun intended) the startling and momentous sound of the captivating future.Ryan Gosling again proves his brilliant talent, in a authentic performance of pain and humanity carrying the soul of the film through his character's journey. Jared Leto's scene chewing creepy Ninader Wallace is a disturbing display of character that will stay with you for a ages. Ford's returning presence was an impressive display especially in his first contact with Gosling (A reprisal I found much more credible than his performance in the recent Star Wars) Blade Runner 2049 is the cinematic spectacle people have been waiting for years and is arguable the most significant film of 2017 and is most defiantly one of the most mesmerising. The most perfectly executed sequel to a loved classic I have ever seen. The original Blade Runner for me will always be on top, but Denise Villeneuve's work is an exceptional accomplishment.",10,3,13,7 October 2017
First Man," Only 33
","Ryan Gosling brings massive intensity as Neil Armstrong in Damien Chazelle's First Man.Leaving the Hollywood musical scene, Chazelle reaches for the stars in this biopic, bringing all his cinematic talent from La La Land (2016) into a space epic.Pilot Neil Armstrong (Gosling), desperate to escape the grief of his daughter, joins the NASA, for the Gemini missions and eventually Apollo 11, striving to touch the surface of the moon. While ruthless to make the giant leap for mankind, Armstrong struggles to keep himself together and tender to his wife (Claire Foy) and children.Astonishing to think that only at the age of 33 Damien Chazelle has already written himself in film history and he continues to do so with First Man. Although I said it was a 'space epic', what Chazelle is more interested in is the relationship between Neil and Janet, as the earthbound strains and anxieties make Neil want to escape his grief. As well as being a an exhilarating journey to the moon, Chazelle's creation is more of a character drama than a space epic.Its Gosling and Foy's chemistry at the very heart of the film, struggling to let go of the past, but afraid to show any emotion of it, Gosling's Armstrong is silent and isolated, fixed on his mission. A role which has felt comfortable for Gosling, but in moving quiet passion he is a man finding it hard to breath but continuing to hold his breathe. Armstrong's emotional comptonization is shown rarely but when it is revealed in heart-breaking motion, from the interaction with his children, to his moments of solitude.This is mainly seen through the eyes his wife Janet who releases the feelings for both of them. Foy stunningly shows how she tries to support her husband's mission but in she clearly hides the fear of losing her husband. Foy's performance brings us closer to the disturbing shock and danger of the mission and how much it cost. It's in the show and not tell that makes Foy's performance outstanding.In frequent close ups and shaky cam, First Man puts us right in the middle of the action, bringing to life history itself. Chazelle's collaboration with cinematographer Linus Sandgren has brought him great favour again, from opening right in a test flight leaving you clenched and breathless from the start. With another previous collaborator Justin Hurwitz the brilliant creator of the heavenly score for La La Land, Hurwitz gives us an glorious and atmospheric soundtrack. From the gentle yet powerfully moving harps to the lonely nostalgic sound of the thermion, Hurwitz score carries the emotional intensity, thrill ride, and silent wonder of space all together.It is here we also find an acquainted operatic display, as First Man echoes similar space epics, From 2001 (1968) to even Interstellar (2014). In the several overwhelming test flights to the ultimate climax we are met with stellar sound design, culminating the loud launches and crashes with unexpected silence is almost entrancing. Chazelle combines cinematic practice with emotional drive to create one inspiring work, again another example of how beautiful blockbuster cinema can bePay no attention to the ridiculous controversy brought by some very annoying Americans, First Man is astonishingly sharp and beautiful, one of the most impressive films of the year. Chazelle reminds us of this great accomplishment in human history, that we may neglect from time to time, I know I do, but powers it with a fantastic character story.",10,1,4,27 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Something had found us.....Dan Trachtenberg.
","10 Cloverfield Lane is the spiritual sequel to the 2008 found footage monster movie Cloverfield, featuring the very scary John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher, Jr. It follows the events of a young woman who wakes up in an underground bunker after a car crash, and discovering Howard (Goodman) who claims that some unique event has wiped out everything on the surface and poisoned the air. 'Monsters come in many forms' they do indeed in this intense, suspenseful thriller (horror). First, it does not need any viewers to see the previous film, I believe though they are completely different films.So hats off to Dan Trachtenberg's gripping debut as he directs an experience we will never forget. John Goodman makes the best performance I have ever seen from the fine actor (have not seen to many Goodman films, but enough), as he shows of a psychotic Norman Bate of himself. As soon as you see him you know this character is not right, actually prefer to be fighting monster instead. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, also gives a great performance as well as we share the experience with her, and almost imagine ourselves in her position.The film is really intense, and will always keep you on your toes, for whatever comes your way. What makes the narrative so good is that if focuses on what's happening elsewhere when the world is going to hell, and ask you where would you rather be, underground or on land, trust me after seeing this film, you may not know.However, I can't say the film is a must see, but if you like a great intense experience, then this is perfect for you. I'm not sure about how the film end either, but the film overall is still really good, and a 9/10.",8,0,2,19 March 2016
War Dogs," War Dogs: an entertaining, exciting, and rarely funny true story
","Miles Teller and Jonah Hill star in the remarkable true story of two young arms dealers who became way over their head when they try to snag a $300 million dollar deal. Todd Phillips who brought us the Hangover trilogy gives us a reveal of how much money is invested into the US military, and it can be easily intercepted by two twenty something year old's.Watching Jonah Hill and Miles Teller felt like these two had been working together for years and therefore another successful duo seen on screen this year. We witness the events through Miles Teller's eyes as David Packouz a former massage therapist who jumps from his hollow career to the dangerous arms trade. Though Teller's performance is standard he effectively acts to be the average Joe in the scenario and guides us through the story as the narrator and helps us relate to the character in the situation. We may not totally approve of what this pair are doing we are in favour that Miles Teller ends up okay.But at the heart of it is Hill's performance as the Scarface impersonating money thirsty gangster Efraim Diveroli. Hill gives us a great performance unseen by any other young actor trying to be a rich arms trader, but unfortunately carries a very annoying laugh throughout the film.Also making an appearance is the always charming Bradley Cooper who passes the torch to the aspiring dealers in providing his assistance in the trade. Although his appearance is brief he still gives us a dangerous Robert De-Niro style meeting.War Dogs although based on true events is a surprisingly entertaining and an easy to watch experience. However the film does juggle with its serous dark themes and comedic moments which doesn't quite reach what it wants, as what you get are rather hit and a miss jokes that don't work at the right times, but what you do get are effective jokes that takes a breather from all the seriousness which is much better. This also only really takes place during the middle of the film and from the beginning and end we have the more dark atmosphere of what's going on.All in all War Dogs is entertaining and fascinating in revealing its true story and I'm sure won't let anyone down, but it does not quite make a good balance in humour and drama. 7.6/10",7,1,1,31 August 2016
John Wick," Absolutely delivers, is cool, and admirable.
","Although this viewer has not seen many other works of Reeves, I can see he is an experienced actor, getting himself back into the big films. Reeves stars in the all-out action packed John Wick. The film shows the events of an ex hit-man who comes out of retirement to seek revenge on the Russian mafia, who stole his last chance to find solace in his grief over his late wife.The film is filled with non-stop violence, which presents Reeves' Matrix acrobatic skills as he takes down highly trained assassins. What make the film most fun is how the violence is shown. For example the acrobatic skills and moves performed by Reeves is very admirable and exciting. To add style to it as well Reeves also pulls the trigger by wearing very smart suits which makes the action very clean.Thankfully the film does not resort to all elements of a typical action film: the girl, the archenemy, and frequent defeats. The film also displays beautiful cinematography, and stunning visual effects.Unfortunately, the story is all not fixed, to me the film felt like the middle of a story, lacking an introduction, and a revolving ending. Also Reeves performs more with his body and less with his voice, which weakens the actor's performance. The film is also very cold and dark which gives the audience the same feeling.To all dog lovers, the first 15 minutes of this film is not for you. To action enthusiasts, this film completely delivers.To summarise, John Wick is not a 'must see' but a cracking good watch, and is the action of the year.",8,2,6,3 October 2015
A Star Is Born," 'Electrifying'
","Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's music romance is a rip-roaring journey back stage of love and fame. A star is truly born in Bradley Cooper's directorial debut.When returning from a gig, country music singer: Jackson Maine (Cooper) walks into a drag bar to find a phenomenal voice in waitress Ally (Gaga) moonlighting as a club singer. Enchanted, Jackson and Ally share an evening professing their passion for music, leading Jackson inviting her to join him on stage during a concert to reveal her voice to the world. The couple's romance quickly blossoms as Ally's musical career begins, but Jackson's alcohol and drug addiction begins to disrupt their dreams.42 years following Frank Pearson version with Barbra Streisand, Cooper launches his directing career with a 21st century re-envisioning of the Hollywood classic. Following the legacy of Janet Ganor, Judy Garland, and Streisand, Gaga is an apt idol of modern pop, and her transference of her musical talent to the screen is magnetic. With rumours of Clint Eastwood directing the project in 2011 with Beyoncé, I can honestly say I'm glad Eastwood's project never lifted the ground. It's incredible to think that the man who stared in three Hangover movies, and voiced a space racoon, can produce a stunning piece of cinema. As demonstrated from A Star is Born, Cooper understands the art and craft of filmmaking, and its a joy to see him put his skill to work. As the alcoholic Jackson Maine, Cooper depicts a likeness to Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line (2005), but at his centre is a heart passionate to share Ally to the world, but troubled by his tinnitus, pulling him to the bottle. Donning a deep Arizona accent Cooper loses himself deeply into the role. A character on the edge but spirited to heighten Ally's gift. Then we have Lady Gaga as the Ally who's nervous and hidden soul majestically blossoms in her romance with Jackson and her rise to fame opposite Jackson's decent. Gaga has complete investment in the film and we completely buy into her. Moments on and off stage Gaga crushes it as the heartfelt Ally. Gaga and Cooper's chemistry on screen is sublime, the very heart beat of the film itself, producing several powerhouse ballads.Opening in the middle of a concert with the roaring crowds, howling guitars tuning and high frequency amps, met with the smooth camera motion, Cooper literally invites us to join him on stage to be in the moment. This no more true than during the climax of the first act, when we witness the captivating 'Shallow' already picked for award attention for Best Original Song. At this point I have never found a better moment to use the world 'electrifying'. Matthew Libatique's cinematography engulfs the audience into the music scene, decorating each shot in exquisite lighting and composition producing beautiful imagery throughout the film. Any one of these shots could be seen on an album cover.Cooper remarkably presents the joys and troubles of showbusiness with the central couple's imbalanced relationship, one rising to fame, the other declining. With a realistic feel to the drama behind the stage, alike to the ups and downs of La La Land (2016). But know that this is in no way like the Hollywood musical, but an honest romance occurring in the music industry. There is much excitement to be had in the music but also much sorrow.With already early awards buzz, A Star is Born will no doubt be a hit for the audiences and critics and will do well when awards season arrives. I am hoping that viewers who love The Greatest Showman (2017) will see this and forget all about that nonsense and appreciate a real piece of cinema.",9,2,4,7 October 2018
Wind River," Heat to the Cold Sheridan's fantastic crime thrillers work beyond change in weather
","After the southern heat of Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan gives us the cold wintery thriller Wind River.In the frosty Wind River Indian Reservation of Wyoming, the body an 18 year old Native American girl is discovered by Wildlife service agent Cory Lambett (Jeremy Renner). Lambett with his knowledge of the mountain assists foreign FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olson) to track down the killer, but also his own personal reasons wants to find the killer in an attempt to wrestle his own demons.Inspired by true cases of missing native American girls, Wind River has cold hearted passion in its story-telling. A very melancholy murder mystery drama exploring grief and vengeance but also the neglect of the Native Americans in the mountain regions in the USA.During a time this week while I was pondering the significance of different crime thrillers, with also the approach of the The Snowman in November, Wind River is real important stand out. The film itself although is about a murder is more centred on the atmosphere and location. Repetitive vibes of a hellish land resonate throughout the film. This mostly breathed life by the chilly aerial shots of the cold mountain land, identifying misery through the snow breeze and wind (an atmospheric format that was similar expressed in Hell or High Water). The most haunting aspect is the character brought to Wind River by Nick Cave and Warren Elis eerie soundtrack, echoing the dark past of the freezing land.What leads us into the desolate mystery of Wind River is Jeremey Renner superb performance as the experienced hunter possessed by the past but also enriched with perception of his home land and its welcome. Renner very much appears as himself, however is a perfect casting choice with his neutral expression hiding his deeper emotions. Opposite is Elizabeth Olson, the most convincing FBI agent I've seen on screen for a while. But her city slicker style does not prepare her for the divergent law enforcement experience in the isolated Wyoming. These two leads are the perfect casting, with a enigmatic presence that makes you completely believe in them.While Wind River has deeper meaning at its centre, Sheridan knows how to thrill his audience in quiet sensational but violent sequences. Loud sound effects of the gun shots bring light to the silent landscape that the characters dwell, and present a sense of realism to the experience.Sheridan's third feature in his trilogy of modern American law enforcement, following, Sicario, Hell or High Water, has shown his strength in creating masterful crime thrillers with much to reflect about the real world. This capacity has also lead stronger confidence his potential prospects in directing a Bond film. 9.2/10",9,116,141,9 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A very pleasant modern nod to classic Star Wars.
","The prequel sequel spin off movie set before a New Hope, arrives following the journey of the group of Rebels who are on a mission to steal the plans for the completed Death Star.Gareth Edwards (Monsters) executes a perfectly superb Star Wars spin off, the old and new. Bringing Star Wars fans on a history trip back in time to the excitement of Star Wars in the early days, and packing a real exciting punch. With a brilliantly developed ensemble cast, led by Felicity Jones, Rogue One transports us across the galaxy into a fantastically moving and fun journey.Jyn Erso (Jones) is an orphaned rogue criminal lost in her way, until she is recruited by the Rebels to help fight against the Empire and find out about this new ultimate weapon. Allying with a very diverse group of Rebels, they must all come together to bring hope to the galaxy and face the dreaded Empire.Now that Disney have brought back Star Wars, they are going to do as much as they can to squeeze as much money out of our pockets. Buts it's worth it if they make dam good movie. Therefore Rogue One very much is an introduction to the future planned prequels on the way.The main inescapable issue with prequels and sequels, especially if they are part of a franchise that's about 30-40 years old, there is clearly going to be a change in the tone and atmosphere of the films depending on when they were made. So its sometimes hard to believe the events your watching are meant to take place in the same universe as a film that came out in 1977. But Rouge One pulls it off with a sensational final act, expressing the full and beautiful pride that us geeks and fans have in the Star Wars Franchise.Rouge One is its own story, but is still Star Wars, with a relatively slow and averagely entertaining first act, and second act, the film build us up to the ultimate climax. With the Force Awakens only being released a year ago, Gareth Edwards shows us that they have not forgotten the original series that started it all. Thankfully with an appropriate amount of jokes as well, mostly derived from the obnoxious droid K2SO (Alan Tudyk) I personally much prefer this to Force Awakens, as it captures what I love in Star Wars. I do like the Force Awakens but I have a lot of issues with it.Although fairly rough around the edges and a final act that makes and steals the whole film, Rouge One is what the fans want, a modern yet classic Star Wars tale, with a several cameos, and the pure pride of being Star Wars. 9.0/10",8,5,11,16 December 2016
Zootopia," 'Try everything' even this amazing film that will not disappoint at all
","Zootropolis (UK) or Zootopia (US) is the new fun family Disney animated adventure that finally explains why in all animated films the animals act basically like humans. The film centers on ZPD Cop Judy Hopps who is the first rabbit police officer in Zootropolis and hopes to make the world a better place. However, when she is demoted to parking duty she meets a slick Fox hustler, who becomes the key for Judy to solve a case in the city that will prove her worthiness as a police officer.Zootropolis is a brilliant, exciting and hilarious film to see, very enjoyable for all audiences, and will make your day. It is absolutely fuelled with funny jokes that will even really tickle adults as well. It is visually stunning and so beautiful you would want to visit the animal kingdom itself. It is also supported by a great song 'Try Everything'. Like 'Everything is Awesome' it fills me with an appreciation for life.Like any other animated film, it is filled with heartwarming messages of reaching for your dreams and believing in yourself, but also some more really grown up messages potentially trying to mirror society, such as diversity and understanding. This made the film seem really mature, creating a real impact to me as a viewer. Of course this does not make it inappropriate for children at all. I'd like to see much more animated films with depth.Although I only really got into the story by half way through, so it needs to pick up after a while. But the narrative is one of the strongest points of the film, as you will gather when you see it yourself.The problem with these films is that at the end, it puts you in such a feel good mood, you don't want it to end. One day I hope to see a Disney animated film that is 3 hours long.A very strong enjoyable film, with much more depth to it, not the best animated though but a very good one, 8/10.",10,4,9,31 March 2016
Us," Fear Yourself
","When the Wilson family arrive for their holidays in Santa Cruz, father: Gabe (Winston Duke) is pumped for the family fun, but mother: Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) feels sceptical for their peaceful vacation, as a past trauma seems to be haunting her. When night comes, another mysterious family appear outside their house, who begin to terrorise the Wilson family, but appear to be a set of doppelgangers carrying very lethal scissors.Fresh off his Oscar success with Get Out (2017), Jordan Peale cements his course for the horror genre in a new complex episode. Coincidentally being the new host of the upcoming revised Twilight Zone series, Jordan Peale directs an ambitious original tale of terror wrapped in its own dimension of mystery. The notion of the danger coming after you being yourself is a creepy concept, and Peale takes this into a gripping thriller opening up to a fascinating reality.Taking a more joyful embrace of the horror genre, Us goes full out to scare, disturb and shock. The nightmare beginning with a classic home invasion is familiar territory but patiently frightening. The doppelgangers' lack of movement and intimidating stillness is enough to send shivers, accompanied by their overarching grins; we know that they not carrying those scissors to offer a free haircut. Praise be given to chorography throughout the film for its constant parade of sinister, embodied beautifully by the cast, especially to Evan Alex who plays Jason and his doppelganger Pluto in a feral animalistic physical performance. Even one moment for me during the final climax matched a perfect note of sound and movement, tense but like a ballet.Lupita Nyong'o carries a fearsome energy all the way, encompassing the victim of terror as well as the terror itself. A magnificent staple of double identities, Nyong'o is unstoppable in both roles, a strong heroine but unnerving villain (but which is which, Peale suggests). Winston Dukes brings the relative breather in the mist of the horror, offering a frequent variety of comical lines, and humorous moments. Peale wants us to enjoy the experience as well as dread it at times. Even Elizabeth Moss's presence is well judged for the scares.Although stating clearly that this one is not dealing with race issues, Peale continuous a political engagement through an expressive exploration of horror. The scariest thing in the world can be ourselves. An ambiguous statement, but Peale leaves enough blank spaces for this thesis to be interpreted for ourselves. As the title implies and a later a cut-throat line of dialogue: 'We're Americans' brings clear to the table the ideas that Peale wants to address. With the current state of America, Peale wants to invert some challenging ideas on where a sense of position, identity, and social divide stem from; not all explicitly explored. More subtle then Get Out, Peale again holds up a mirror but really hands it to the audience for what is it they are seeing. It may be confusing, but Peale's efforts are a skilled practise of cinema and genre.Jordan Peale's new nightmare is an impressive and exhilarating watch, definitely one to come for the fun and fear, but also you're in for an intriguing new socio-political study, along with a few laughs now and then.",8,3,6,25 March 2019
Spotlight," Overwelming
","Overwhelming, and excellent are just two of the qualities this film has.Spotlight tells the true investigation of the Boston Globe Spotlight team to uncover the scandal of Boston priests who abused children. A cold, heart breaking story that is told so well, you need to see it to know it.It is a very strong simple film that plainly explores the investigation itself, supported by brilliant performances from the ensemble cast, particularly from Ruffalo, Keaton, McAdams, and Schreiber.You are completely drawn into the story, and how it develops only pulls you closer. It is very solid and unbelievable that you are learning about real events.It has frequent moments that just open your mind and make you feel real emotion, and deep thought. Even though it is a dark story is a very well made film, strong piece of cinema.This may not be the right film for people who don't find a full talking film very appealing, but it is very compelling, and eye opening that does not make it dull at all.It is also supported by a moving score that represents the atmosphere perfectly and only makes you feel more affected by the story.It is a pure 9/10, on its own its excellent, but with the Oscars on the way, I am unsure whether it is the right film for Best Picture. However, this is highly recommended, and defiantly deserves praise.",10,0,0,30 January 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Unique Solid MCU fun
","Tom Holland really hits the spot in his first solo web swinging adventure.Returning to his regular friendly neighbourhood life in Queens, after his call to arms in Captain America Civil War, Peter Parker must earn his wings as a super hero by tending to his local community cries for help, while balancing his academic life, including his best friend, his crush and bully. But Peter gets his chance to prove himself when righteous salvager Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) the winged Vulture beings smuggling extra-terrestrial advanced weaponry, and its down to the wall crawler to take him down.The journey of Spider-Man has been a long one from the camp 70s TV series, Toby Maguire's perfect Peter Parker, just not so much Spider-Man, to Andrew Garfield not so perfect Peter Parker, to excellent Spider-Man. Now thanks to Marvel and Sony's new agreement we are blessed with the sensational presence of Tom Holland. Since he wowed us with his brief appearance in Civil War, fans have not slept till we saw his own flick, and how much does this man deliver. Although still not bang on the precise age of Spider-Man Tom Holland does amazingly capture the exciting teenager character of Spider-Man, a much more realistic and enjoyable screen presence, something that Magurie and Garfield could never bring.With spot on directing by Jon Watts Homecoming wonderfully explores the real life troubles of Spider-Man, especially at the early stages of hero-ing he is. With great focus and detail to Parker's teen life with a great mixture of a thrilling plot and well establish villain (something that the MCU does struggle with, just not today). This is brought to life the rest of the supporting cast, such as Keaton, who demonstrates a who new Birdman since his last costume role. Furthermore Parker's best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) proving significant contribution to the laugh factor. Robert Downy Jr also popping once or twice to play the role he must certainly nail in his sleep, Tony Stark/Iron Man. This was also a relief as Iron Man's appearance is perfectly distributed in a low key tone not once stealing the thunder of Holland.One thing that the MCU does seem to do well in is the laughs, and with a wonderfully witty character like Spider-Man there is much loud laughs to be had. Not just brought by Holland but the majority of the cast. One slight resentment is that there may so many jokes that could convince yourself your in an all out comedy movie, but when the action and drama starts, it becomes an intense roller-coaster.It may seem that this just another spider man film (in 3 years) but the MCU creates more space for all heroes in their own worlds. So when we enter Spider-Man's world we can have a fun and energetic perspective of the world of super-heroes. This of course comes form Tom Hollands performance. There is great national pride to be taken since we have had two British Spider-Mans in a row.Spider-Man Homecoming is a magnificent exhilarating experience unique on its own for the MCU, with a flawless performance by the worlds perfect Spider-Man Tom Holland. Sold Fun. 8.8/10",9,8,17,6 July 2017
Black Mass," A must see performance by Depp
","As Edward he was soft, as Jack he was funny, but now he's deadly.Johnny Depp returns with a mind blowing performance as Boston gangster Whitey Bulger in thrilling crime drama Black Mass.The film focuses on Bulger's alliance with the FBI to catch a bigger gangster, however things get out of control as Bulger brings his killer attitude with him. Also starring Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon, the film provides varieties of five star performances, and scenes.When you meet Bulger on screen, it's not Johnny Depp it is Whitey Bulger, and he has a danger zone cover his entire body space, one you cross it, you will be in the ground. He's scary, and a nightmare for a neighbour, and if you think that sounds negative, it's completely far from it, if an actor achieves this description in a film, then you know a great performer.If you want to know more on Boston's gangster history, then Black Mass is a film that will peak your interest, but also make you discuss. Although it not be as acclaimed as classics such as the Godfather, and Goodfellas, this film is still a brilliant biography of a dangerous criminal.Black Mass is a must see performance by Depp, although maybe not being the absolute must see film of the year, but still a thrilling, magnificent piece of work. I give it 8/10",7,1,2,28 November 2015
Suicide Squad," Fun not great
","The anticipated Suicide Squad is in cinemas and is okay. Following the events of Dawn of Justice, Amanda Waller assembles a team of villains to work together to stop a supernatural threat. Directed by David Ayer (not Snyder) the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) continues to grow by introducing the DC equivalent of Guardians of the Galaxy (the only difference being that Guardians of the Galaxy is a masterpiece). The Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith) Haley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and some other character shoe horned inn, also the Joker Played by Jared Leto.So what is expected of the film on one hand is provided, as kick ass, cool, and loud action to make a real fun cinema experience. On the other hand what was also expected was an awesome strong film with consistency, but this is not quite the same film I saw in the trailers.So what happens to the film is a rushed pace, that goes wonky at the end, with some layered characters next to some very un-layered characters in a narrative with not much consistent direction. What holds the film together is Margot Robbie's performance which really carries everything with her pure insanity. Although Will Smith plays a pretty cool Deadshot, all I see is Smith being the same as he always is in every other film. So what should be a Squad becomes a duo as these two are the only real characters in the whole film. Which brings us to Jared Leto. We all know that no actor could beat the great Heath Ledger when it comes to playing the Joker, and Leto holds no candle at all, by providing a gangster Joker which no one asked for. What Leto does nail is the scary intimidation of the Joker, but struggles to be the Joker we all know and love.What is also a vital part to the film is the action sequences, which are enjoyable at first but end up getting more dramatic. This is also supported by a very strong use of CGI which pretty much invades the whole film. The film also provides entertainment with its humour which we were hoping to quite consistent, but it appears every line has to be delivered by Robbie or Smith as the scene is about to end.What I also found annoying was the narrative as it feels sloppy and does feel like its heading in the direction it should do, and with the consistent mad and fun atmosphere flowing through, but it does not quite match with what it concludes with at the end.The DCEU so far has not had a good start, but at the moment Suicide Squad is the lesser of three evils, with enjoyable action and fun. 7.0/10",6,6,9,13 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Absolutely fun and what Marvel do best
","This isn't really a review, more or an informal statement.So this has been the number one film I've been looking forward to all year (yep more than Civil War and Finding Dory) for a few reasons, one its a marvel Movie which I am a big fan off, Doctor Strange is a great character and story, and Benedict Cumberbatch is my favourite actor. (just to say I have more a right than a lot of other people to say that Cumberbatch is my favourite actor as I have been following his career for 6 years now since the first episode of Sherlock) All this in one is just brilliant.Although this year I have been very nervous about whether it would be good or not. Don't get me wrong the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) have never made a bad film) but after some of the bi disappointments this year (Batman vs Superman, suicide squad, X men Apocalypse ( I like it but the majority of society doesn't)) and that the director Scott Derrickson has only produced not great horror films, I did worry slightly.But I am so glad to breath a proud sigh of relief, as Marvel have done their job as usual in creating a great fun action film with a great story and well executed performances. A really solid piece of blockbuster entertainment and fantasy.Doctor Stephen Strange is brilliant but arrogant neuro surgeon who's use of his hands fails him when he is victim to a car accident. He will then become so lost that he seeks help and guidance in the Ancient One, who teaches him in art of the dimensional and mystic arts to become a defender of his world to stop an approaching evil.First Cumberbatch, brilliant executes the role of Stephen Strange, an ignorant surgeon who becomes to obsessed with his ego and then transforms into the mystical sorcerer supreme. I was concerned about Cumberbatch's accent but its absolutely fine so no worries there. What I love about Cumberbatch is that he can tackle countless roles and characters which is what is very clear here, by displaying elements of being an ass-whole (excuse my language) becoming a strong confident hero and also a quirky humorous fellow.A big hats off to Tilda Swinton as well delivering an awesome performance as the mysterious Ancient One, showing off her wise craftsmanship as a teacher and skills as a defender of the dimensions.The story is a solid great structure with comfortable direction by Scott Derickson, just a bit rough around the edges in a few moments, but nothing to make me go mental over the internet.One of the big aspects of this film is the heavy visual effects, giving us a hint of Christopher Nolan's Inception at times (best film ever made). This wonderfully developed visual artwork really puts you in the realms of dimension and transports you to worlds never seen before in the MCU. I wouldn't be surprised to see this nominated at the Oscars.This is a key aspect that sets Doctor Strange from the rest of the movies, as it enters a whole new universe of super hero. But that what I love about Marvel is that the super heroes aren't really typical super heroes. (Cpt America, is a super strength patriot, Thor is a God, Hulk is a green monster, and Doctor Strange is a sorcerer) Doctor Strange was everything I wanted and needed it to be, a really solid good, fun, Marvel movie with a spot on performance by Cumberbatch, can't wait to see him in the future movies. Great fun Loved it 8.6/10",8,107,204,25 October 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Why Martin McDonogh is a fantastic writer
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a very poignant and moving tale of justice, grief and redemption about a unstable little community opposing Frances McDomand's rough, and tough Mildred Hayes.From playwrite, director: Martin McDonagh creator of In Bruges (2008), and Seven Psychopaths (2012), and numerous plays such as The Beauty Queen of Leenane, brings us a remarkable new black comedy, led by a ruthless display compelling performances . With a mix of tension and laughs as per usual to McDonagh's previous work, Three Billboards thrives in its substance and characters, in a surprisingly sentimental story.Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) wages her own war against her town's police department by putting up three billboards with direct messages to the police, after no progress or effort has been shown after Hayes' daughter Angela was raped and murder. Protesting her acts, Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) tries to keep the town from tearing itself apart from the indecorous billboards. But Hayes' real battle is with despicable Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). As the billboards stir the pleasant towns folk, Hayes gradually earns herself more enemies attracting more hate to her and her son.Less thrill ride than Psychobaths but more dark passion as with In Bruges, McDonagh's latest achievement is a vigorous triumphant in story-telling. With a immense ensemble cast leading the way and a script as naturally articulated by the cast sets McDonagh's drama in its realist genuine setting.McDomand bringing an astonishingly fierce performance as the grieving mother, shows more grit than her more cheerful detective from Fargo (1996). Every moment with Hayes is an emotional presence of anguish but also sorrow. McDormand thrives forcefully in a rough kick performance of aggression, fuelling the drive of the film. Especially shot in intense close ups, our attention is drawn to the intensity and emotion.Sam Rockwell also finally receives the recognition he deserves as a fantastic supporting role as the sluggish, racist Dixon whose demented life style is just as abroken as Hayes. Rockwell's familiar drunk charm and quirkiness serve him best in his latest performance for the antagonist. Dixon's odyssey in the film manifests in a timeless journey of redemption.If you haven't learnt of McDonagh's genius as a writer, than Three Billboards is the hard cold evidence. One of the unique things that the trailer sadly misleads you on, is that although you may think this is quirky black comedy and it is, but still has really mournful heart in its centre subject matter. Continuing to tie in the accustomed biblical concepts and heaven and hell, Three Billboards is another formidable reflection of the soul.McDonagh triumphantly brings out real humanity in this twisted drama. Its the small moments McDormand crying towards the camera are really heart-melting. The transition that McDonagh constructs for his characters are a fabulous force of spirit, rather encouraging at this point in time. Carter Burwell's soundtrack furthermore is an appropriate background, guiding the tale from start to finish, contributing to petite moments of sadness.An exceptional mix of comedy, wow, and healing, Three Billboards is an unpredictable sorrowful story with an unforgettable presence of talent by the ensemble cast, but is maintained and victorious in its masterly story brought to life by McDonagh.",9,2,5,13 January 2018
Baby Driver," Edgar Wright cranks up the tunes, turns on the ignition in Baby Driver, unique action driver film Baby Driver.
","Baby, B.A.B.Y (Ansel Elgort) is a get a way driver hired by crime boss Doc (Kevin Spacey), who with his personal blend of music in ears drowning out his tinnitus becomes the best and most skilled driver ever to hit the road. However, in a underworld where doesn't belong, Baby tries to escape this life, especially as he meets waitress Deborah (Lilly James) Director: Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim) conjured this idea of a structure combination of music and action 2 decades ago with focus on the right soundtrack to match the driving action. He most certainly has demonstrated this in his quirky action-packed thriller.Delivering a new twist of action, correlated to the fantastic choices of music, Baby Driver becomes its own film setting the quirky, fun atmosphere through the immense soundtrack. Each song telling their own story and expressing the emotion and tone of each scene, but most importantly putting us in the driver seat of Baby, and the life he leads. With one most exhilarating opening credits scene.Driven with action packed sequences Baby Driver is full of fun and thrills, including the most impressive driving scene witness in a film for a long time. Well constructed sequences wonderfully put together consisting sensational shot tracking shots, and a non-stop thrill ride event occurring in the third act.What also Baby Driver is made of is, its foundation of classic drivers movies, including, Walter Hill's The Driver, Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive, and aspects of Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde, but very much standing on its own legs, as Empire Magazine called it 'One of the most utterly original films in years.' Although I don't completely agree with the majority of that statement, but Wrights creative use of the soundtrack spark the unique magic that sparks Baby Driver.Although I can most certainly appreciate Wright's work, I undoubtedly do scratch my head as I necessarily don't quite understand what exactly about the film that earned it massive critical and public applause on this level. I perfectly enjoy it but seem to be missing this wow factor that has caught many others viewers.One of the stand out features of the film is the great ensemble performances, such as Elgort's closed off Baby a perfectly executed character. Opposite Spacey's Doc who chews up scenes with his Underwood like authoritative speeches and heist plans, then Lilly James' sweet waitress Deborah, although with little background acts the perfect love interest for Baby. The stand out for me was Jamie Fox's Bats, intense when he needs to be and a scene stealing rough mouth.Baby Driver is a wonderful mixture of action and music and car chases unique to the action genre. Although arguable I didn't quite meet the reaction that most others have reached, this is most certainly a film to enjoy, if you appreciate Wright's other works, enjoy a fun thrill ride adventure, or love jamming to your tunes while cruising in your vehicle. 8.2/10",8,12,21,29 June 2017
The Revenant," 100000000000000/10
","Films are works of art, pieces not to be taken for granted, unless they are ones that want to be taken for granted. There is a new term for the word masterpieceRevenant!!Unbelievable, breath taking, exhilarating, these descriptions are not enough to describe this wonderful movie. When left for dead by the rest of his military group, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) must look death in the face and battle great woodlands to seek vengeance on the one who betrayed him. DiCaprio is mind blowing in his performance that looks so convincing, you'll believe he actually went through it. You do not recognise this man at all in his performance, there is no sign of Belfort, Jack Dawson, or Cobb, DiCaprio shows us a completely new person, you won't believe he is even an actor. FWI I am being deadly serious here, not joking at all. One of the most unique parts of the film, is the use in cinematography, the most effective, and beautiful use I have ever seen. It pulls you in to the film, and you completely feel the rush of the film through your body. Alejandro González Iñárritu has pulled of another remarkable, and stunning piece of cinema, that will take you to a whole new world of film. It may be long, but every moment pulls you closer.This truly is the most amazing, beautiful, and unbelievable film I have ever seen, and is now close to becoming the best. It's a whole new experience and must be viewed in cinemas. It's a complete 10/10, and must be viewed by all film fans.",10,2,7,16 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," That bridge better lead you to the cinema to see this film
","There so much history we don't learn till, many years later, lie I didn't know that Tom Hanks was an American hero.Bridge of Spies follows the acts of an American lawyer who is tasked with defending a soviet spy, but leading him to become the key to peace between two nations. Tom Hanks stars as the brilliantly smart, wise, and very likable character while trying to do the best that he can for his country and relations with the Soviet Union, he becomes caught in a moving tale of an eye for eye, and doing the morally right thing, no matter what is safe.Honestly though, the film took a while to get going for me, as the film mainly consist of men in suits talking and drinking, along with some brilliant dramatic music. However, when we come to the main plot of this exchange in Berlin, the film pulls you in, and now you never want to fall asleep. Even if the event is known to you, you are feeling the suspense.You also get a real life feel of what it was like during the cold war and the tension between the USA and Soviet Union, which makes it a powerful film. This pulls the audience into the time and place, and you get strong emotional reaction in some scenes.I wouldn't say though that the film is unique, I think the story definitely so, but the film is one I've seen a few times.That being said the best part is the final Bridge scene, which really gets you on the edge, not just for suspense but also in pride, and emotion. This was a unique scene for me.Bridge of Spies is a strong 8/10, and is definitely in my list of nominations at the Oscars.",8,1,3,12 December 2015
Apocalypse Now," Here are my thoughts
","After a long journey in pursuing this film, I finally got my hands on Frances Ford Coppola's epic war movie Apocalypse Now (1979). With two accidental purchases of the Redux, version, my anticipation for the original feature was high and hoped my efforts have been worth it. So this is my review/analysis (some slight SPOILERS) During the orange heat of the Vietnam War in 69, isolated Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is tasked with a classified mission of seeking out and terminating Colonel Walter E Kurtz: (Marlon Brando) a officer who has gone insane and become a demi-god among his own native followers in Cambodia leading his own war attacks against the Vietnamese and US. As Willard pursues the fragmented dictator, him and his unit explore the dark depths of the war.From Robert Duvall's famous battle line of 'I love the smell of Napalm in the morning' to Brando's harrowing whispers of the 'the horror, the horror' Apocalypse Now takes a revolutionary journey of war, morality and truth, such a transition is a rare expedition for cinema. Arguably one of the deepest, heaviest films to be made to date, Coppla's work in my eyes is a poetic tale of Vietnam War or war in general. To be perfectly honest, the films wade on me too much for me to even conjure an opinion yet.To someone with no idea of the context of the film, the title 'Apocalypse Now' probably suggests a post apocalyptic setting, but it is more complicated than that. Now titles are very important to me, and I can't help but partly try to consider what the title means while watching the film, until its explained itself. So I'll admit throughout the 2hr and 33mins duration that 15% of mind was trying to work it out while the remaining 75% was fully focused. And what typically ends is being one of those titles with multiple interpretations or implications based on what you have witnessed on screen. The gratifying majority opinion agrees that the title's significance represents the weight of horror and terror in the Vietnam war There's one line that implies soldiers forget their home lives and there is only the war. Coppola shades the majority of the film in a ghastly brown orange colour pallet, mimicking the sandy environment but possibly the horrific atmosphere of a post apocalyptic world. So the title should probably make perfect sense, if I was in Nam at that time, I'd probably think its the apocalypse too.What we find the character of Willard enter is a revolutionary experience of the war, which gets him early closer to Kurtz. Willard is fascinated by the mad Colonel story and continues to read his file throughout his mission. Each part of the war they encounter along the way only builds up intrigue and gradual understanding for Kurtz so called insanity. Coppola slowly constructs great tension and anticipation as we get tot know the character of Kurtz through his file, and await the confrontation. Brando's voice only springs sinister. What we discover is a damaged soldier tired of the killing but still welcoming it as it all he has. There's no doubt about it that Brando is creepy as a ghost, and sees the only truth in the world is continuous destruction demonstrating his sight of the real apocalypse that we live in.One masterful aspect that Coppola constructs in Apocalypse Now, is its magnificent cinematic presence. Brought to live sensationally by Vittorio Storaro's cinematography amazingly capturing the extreme, and at times documentary character to the Vietnam War. Featuring one of the most fierce battle scene when the choppers arrive and begin shooting down below with the sound of Ride of the Valkyries (one of the most influential moments in film history).Coppola's 1979 work earns the name as a work of genius and master art, one of the most 'mad' and heavy pieces of cinema standing against the weight and horror of the Vietnam War, and war itself. I would agree this was an important point in cinema history to be witnessed by all.",10,0,1,5 August 2017
Dunkirk," Nolan Does it again
","Christopher Nolan's new cinematic war thriller literally takes your breath away, as the masterclass director returns in an intense powerful experience.On the beaches of Dunkirk, the British soldiers wait to return to England, but ambushed by German attacks, must fight for survival to get home. In a triptych storyline, we see the events on land for one soldier Tommy played by (Finn Whitehead), in the sea, arriving support their troops Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance), and in air in a British cockpit with Farrier (Tom Hardy) This is a grand event for my relationship with cinema, as Dunkirk had the privilege to be my first IMAX experience, for which the journey is so worth it. With Nolan's 65mm format, Dunkirk is not a film its an experience or better yet it is happening. In such a massive screen at the BFI IMAX, it becomes a powerfully immersive experience that places you right in the middle of Dunkirk, surrounded by the booming sound of the guns and bombs. So many moments you will find yourself holding your breath, the 1hr 47 mins run time is an fierce gripping venture.The magnificence of Christopher Nolan always surprises, as my favourite director, Dunkirk has been a very anticipated feature for me and so many and finally with its release Nolan has amazed as always. Carrying the spectacle of Intersteller (2014) but down to a Belgim, Nolan proves how really gripping, smart, and cinematic film can be. I know that an IMAX experience asks a lot, with the journey to London and higher price, but when a film like this comes along it is very worth your while.Dunkirk is not just a cinematic presentation but also a remembrance to all the soldiers at Dunkirk, emitting a spectacular tone of British pride, Nolan demonstrates his passion and respect for the event, which through certain moments brings out a sensational joy to the heart. With a lack of a script, Nolan resembles silent cinema, and this is where the film is strong, with marvellous beautiful sequences of silence or just sound and no speech creates the real cinema of the film.Hoyte van Hoytema's clutching cinematography is fantastic, from the tense silence at the beach, to the sinking ships, and the rather wonderful landscape shots above Hotema's only drags us further into the film. With a classic Nolanesc feel to way of the camera, we o have a documentary feel to film adding that extra authenticity. The most mesmerising shot war films since Saving Private Ryan (1998).The real technical talent is Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. So many times Zimmer's collaboration with Nolan has given birth to many brilliant tunes, and Dunkirk brings the best one yet. From the tension building sound of the ticking, to the unsettling but absorbing groans of the sea, and ships, Zimmer creates pure war poetry and indeed horror.As for the ensemble cast, Nolan places all members exactly where they should, especially Kenneth Branagh's pier commander is exactly perfect for the film. Tom Hardy showing off his eye acting talents with his plane mask on, experience gained from his role as Bane no less. But a well done is deserved to Finn Whitehead in his debut film with a real perspective of the disaster.Christopher Nolan proves once again why he is the greatest director of all time, in an explosive cinematic experience. Inception and the Dark Knight will always be his masterpieces, but Dunkirk is a wonderful piece of work. I do strongly recommend an IMAX viewing if possible, or just a cinema experience. 10/10",10,5,14,21 July 2017

The Favourite," The Favourite is a very enjoyable, mad tale, webbed in glorious design,
","During the early 18th Century, Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) becomes bedridden from a severe case of gout, while needing to tend to serious matters regarding the war with France. Her confidant; Sarah (Rachel Weisz) tends to the Queen's duties herself and comforts her in an extreme intimate nature. Arriving at the palace is Abigail (Emma Stone) cousin of Sarah who seeks employment , but is degenerately put to work in the slum kitchens where she is forced to sleep in a cramped room with countless others. While Anne is helpless in bed, Abigail sneaks her self into the Queen's favour becoming her new bedroom maid, toppling her friendship with Sarah, and emotively aggravating Sarah.Within the first moments of the Favourite, I think you immediately decide whether you are on board with it, and I found myself in comfortable arms from the very beginning. In a very quick and witty story, the Favourite is an easily enjoyable and elegant tale, if you are compatible with the world of wigs and mad humour. Slightly far off the tone of Lanthimos previous films, unlike The Lobster (2015), and the Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), The Favourite is a less challenging and more entertaining watch.This is systematically brought to life in widely smart and funny script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. The tension and powerplay in the narrative is almost Shakespearian with its wicked ensemble of double crossing. The pleasure of these character's quibble is truly smashing.The film's true charm is achieved in the love triangle between Queen Anne, Sarah, and Abigail, as both court favourites compete over receiving the Queen's praise and friendship for their own gain. The talents of Coleman, Weisz and Stone are undoubtable expectational, with an exquisite dynamic on screen. Weisz is uptight and tough and an intimidating presence who dominates the film. Although still a confidant, Sarah seems to be really pulling the strings on he political matters. Sarah even walks over the spoilt childlike Anne who roams her palace helplessly shouting at her musicians and cuddling her seventeen rabbits. Coleman's British wackiness seems never out of place. Then Emma Stone; first a sweet and innocent Abigail is sympathetic lead, but gradually reveals only to be a self serving villain herself as she greases herself up to the Queen. Although Coleman's role had been identified as the lead, it feels at times that her presence is mostly overtaken by the performances of Weisz and Stone.Additionally grand is the film's gorgeous periodical production design, covered in the delicate artwork infested hallways and ballrooms, to the coordinated outdoor gardens and palace landscapes. There is an almost post Barry Lyndon-esc serge that echoes through Robbie Ryan's sharp photography. There are frequent shots of spherical frames twisting the scale of the land, but capturing beautiful texture. With a high contrast with the palace rooms, the film's art direction powerfully embodies it's historical period, almost overwhelmingly so.The Favourite is a very enjoyable, mad tale, webbed in glorious design, precisely crafted by Yorgos Lanthimos, but it's heart is truly made in the ensemble cast. If his other films are too weird for you, then I think the Favourite will be a much more amusing experience.",9,3,6,9 January 2019
Room," Discover the world in the beautiful emotional story of Room.
","Room is the splendid unique film that explores the world through the eyes of Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Only knowing the environment of one confined space, the young boy and his mother are welcomed back into society, where Jack slowly begins to discover a whole new planet.This storyline is so cleaver and heartwarming, as it explores mothering relationships, childhood, and discovery. Brie Larson is amazing as being the perfect mother in an imperfect situation, her winning leading actress at the Oscars would be no surprise. And of course Jacob Tremblay plays the wonderful, adorable, real Jack who is so convincing in his performance if it wasn't for Revenant he deserves the Oscar. His performance brings you in to the film and makes you feel like discovering the world for the first time.The whole film is uniquely shot, and feels completely new and different to other films. It makes way for all the emotion that is to come.To the middle of the film it begins to get a bit slow for me, but that is really part of the narrative.In my Oscars list I will hope Brie Larson wins that award, and for the screenplay, but for the moment the big won for me is hoping to go to the Revenant. However Room is beautiful film that will make you draw tears three times and is a clear 9/10.",9,0,5,23 January 2016
A Quiet Place," A honourable construction of terror and concept triumphantly put together by a young director.
","A family living in silence in order to survive detection from sound seeing monsters is a very adventurous film for the former Dunder Mifflin employee, but manages to be successful and bone chilling experience. 'Good work Jim'.I must take my hat off to John Krasinski in his tremendously directional work. It's surprising when you watch a horror film and you yourself are particularly sensitive to jump scares, but you emerge from the cinema with a great big smile on your face. Although filled with tense edge of seat, and moments of unimaginable terror, I couldn't help but love it. This is not a salute to the idea of horror and fear, but purely to the craft that Krasinski has displayed.In the year 2020, when earth has been ambushed by ominous creatures that locate through their amplified sense of hearing, we follow the trail of the Abbott family lead by Lee (Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) with their two children Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe). Living alone on a farm moving only in bare foot and communicating though sign language, the Abbott family are taking every precaution to avoid being found by the creatures. But it only lakes one lamp falling over, one pin to drop for their quiet home to be invaded by petrifying monsters. In a non-stop seat gripping array of set pieces, A Quiet Place is in a inescapable nightmare.Now although the posters, trailers, and what I've just described sounds disconcerting, what A Quiet Place is filled with is sentiment, love and family. A story about a family living together and the efforts their father will go to, to protect them. Kraskinski's lead is a fitting choice in his strong, and leading father and husband, opposite his brave and supporting wife which Blunt delivers mighty. Blunt steals several clenching moments which she seems almost to perfect for, but which also become endless. Regan played by deaf actress Millicent Simmonds is also a stand out performance as the deaf oldest child, which makes her one of the most vulnerable characters in the story but also one of the most strong.Our investment into these characters becomes all the more real with relationships and character drama underneath. On surface this may be horror film, but it is charged with powerful drama and emotion.The films most striking aspect is defiantly the use of sound, poignant to the story and atmosphere. Mostly constructed by silence, the film brings to life the quiet in the world of the film that makes the even smallest noise a little jump. The idea itself of sound being the cause of horror is a fantastic proposal which is really brought to life on screen as Krasinski takes all of cinema to make this sound mixing experience. Then we also have Marco Beltrami's score, familiar to his previous horror work with loud and threating drone noises, but also adds the sentimentality in the family drama which I won't lie almost reduced me to tears.Kraskinski has indeed been daring for this chiller, with moments and sequences that will jaw drop and shock but work in creating a very impressive piece of horror cinema, which is all the more surprising as Michael Bay is also tied to this film, lets hope he's learned a thing or too now.A honourable construction of terror and concept triumphantly put together by a young director.",9,3,5,21 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," An Atmospherc and Beautiful Summer Romance
","A sensual romance about a boy who finds himself through the discovery of another.Luca Guadagnino's third chapter in his desire trilogy, following I am Love (2009) and A Bigger Splash (2015) is Call Me By Your Name, a novel arbitrary love tale between two young men in the shimmering summer of 80s Italy. A romantic drama pealing back the layers of its Romeo and 'Juliet' in a elementary yet bewildering fashion.In the 80s suburban Italy, 17 year old Elio ( Timothée Chalamet) and his parents unwind for their summer lounge, when Oliver (Armie Hammer) a 24 year old academic arrives at the families home to work along side Elio's father Lyle (Michael Stuhlbarg). While Elio's first impressions of the strapping American are sower, Elio's enchantment with Oliver blossoms a beautiful friendship between the two and then as the drama proceeds a romantic one.Guadiagnio's vision of a summer love affair is one to truly be admired by the way Call Me By Your Name eases you into a conceivable relationship. Instead of your traditional love at first sight films. Call Me By Your Name has the confidence to take its time with the characters to produce a remarkable layered character journey. From this we are given the perspective of Elio's world and his flourishing growth as young man, before his world is truly altered by his contact with Oliver. The film is more a coming age of story of Elio as well as a romance.Obviously the coursing heartbeat of the film is the central characters relationship as it blossoms from the very start to finish, an amazing master work in romantic story telling to say the least. As Elio and Oliver converse over music, philosophy and archaeology, the two's connection is thickened in the company of each other, and of us the audience as well. This is wonderfully transcribed in James Ivory's script beautifully adapted from André Aciman's book. Although Elio is our main window into this romance, both characters are as equal as each other, as the title implies.Real masters giving life to this tale is the cast themselves. A fabulous ensemble performance by all participants in a warm welcoming environment, usually found unfamiliar in this narrative context. From Michael Stuhlbarg's wise Lyle passionate about his love of archaeology that he shares with Oliver, while also being a passionate father to Elio guiding him in his journey as a youth. Armie Hammer's Oliver is scene stealing charming puzzle which along side Elio we are trying to unravel. Hammer brings forth an exceptional performance which is already ringing potential Oscar bells. Although those bells better be ringing louder for the true standout performance of Timothée Chalamet. Chalamet brings a marvellous collection of young but also mature character in Elio trying to decipher his own identity which becomes all the more clear when he meets Oliver. A major break out performance hopefully to set Chalamet on the path of even greater work.What moulds Call Me By Your Name is its glistening flavour is its exotic summer presence in honourable landscape beauty of Italy, tenderly caught by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography. A strong throwback to the hot summer just gone, as we now enter the cold winter. A lavish film in its own right, seriously a film to really immerse in with its exotic atmosphere while, pouring its heart out in the characters.Call Me By Your Name is the most remarkable drama of the year, if you believe in any love story this year let it be this one, as your swept in a fantastic voyage of discovering love for the first time. Truly a masterpiece in romantic story-telling.",10,15,37,9 November 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Not Salaza's revenge, Dead men tell no tale but who cares.
","revenge, Dead men tell no tale but who cares.Yet again the Pirates set sale on what seems to be the last adventure, but unfortunately not. After the weak adventure of On Stranger Tides, directors: Joachim RÃ¸nning and Espen Sandberg are Captain of the ship in another poor excuse for a sequel.Set 9 or 12 years after the events of At worlds End, Will Turner's son, Henry (Brenton Thwaites) pursues Jack Sparrow to help him find the Trident of Poseidon to help free his father's curse, but is ambushed by dead man Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem) to deliver his message of vengeance to Sparrow. This leads to a clash of characters being terrorised by the dead, and all in hopeful search of this Trident.Although the Pirates series has never been perfect, I have always found satisfactory enjoyment in the first three, but now I have lost patients. What you have the same reused material and structure again, but really exhausted to the point of apathy. From the very beginning I immediate had no excitement or enthusiasm and just didn't really care at all. Although the main narrative thread is hat they are searching for this magic artefact, (as usual) there is also much else going on, in underdeveloped mini stories just leading nowhere, or nowhere important.You still do have the same swashbuckling action, turned up to a ridiculous degree, moving banks, to zombie sharks, which may still be kind of fun but just too ridiculous, and wasn't enough to keep the woman sitting next to me awake, or the person in front off their phone.What the entire film really relies on is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who has rightly so by other critics become a routine, but just a very annoying routine. I know the whole point of Sparrow is to e a bumbling fool, but from the beginning the character is just drunk, and stays like that for the rest of the film. It feels like a fan's very oversold impression of Sparrow, and Depp is just there to do his thing.What I was hoping to save the film, was Barden's performance as the villain, which he appears to be the only one actually in his character and very intimidating, but is sadly not enough to save the film.We also have the knew Keira and Orlando replacements played by Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario, both just walking plot devises helping to move the story on in no direction. Combined with their weak acting talent and the appalling script, the entire experience is just aggravating. There is even a small theme that is meant to comment on the historical social ideas at the time, which I personally fund to be quite offensive, but I don't know to what degree that it is accurate.Which leads on to the jokes, which by some miracle amused the audience I was with, but did not impress me, besides its humour we surely must all have seen in any other family comedy, but just became another reason to get frustrated.So in the end there is nothing really to like in Pirates 5, it may entertain a younger audience, but I completely lost patients with it. Its not terrible, but just nothing really good happens. 5.5/10",5,3,10,30 May 2017

","This year in super heroes so far: Deadpool Awesome, Dawn of Justice Entertaining but could be better, Captain America Civil War Fantastic and X Men Apocalypse.satisfactory.Following on from the previous brilliant X men films Days of Future Past and First Class, X-Men Apocalypse raises the roof several times to a whole new realm of action, destruction, and of course mutants. Now Xavier's school for mutants has become a proud established academy with many students, but a new threat has risen from the earth. Apocalypse rises to bring about a new earth and kill all life but with the help of four rogue mutants.To start off, X-Men Apocalypse defiantly promises what it delivers in the trailers and on the posters, so for the fans looking for what they see in the trailers is exactly what you get. However, this isn't a super hero masterpiece, but it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Probably not the best out of the X Men series, but impossibly no the worst. I would call this the Age of Ultron of the X-Men universe, or the better version of Man of Steal (associating with how much destruction there is).Before I talk about negatives I will go over positives: good performances by cast (especially Sophie Turner), good direction of narrative to an extent, great score, entertaining, hype building, explosive, slightly funny, and cool use of costume.One of the main problems at the beginning was that there was too much going on, and there are numerous stories going on a the same time so it gets quite crowded. Not just with the story but also characters. It tries to pull focus on too many characters which makes it kind of each person gets their time in the spotlight feel. It is also far too long, which doesn't make you bored but does slightly drag on a bit.I will also say there were moments which I call were awkward tense moments. This is when there are brief moments in the dialogue which try to be significant but are not delivered correctly. For example in Force Awakens when Ren and Rey are fighting and he mentions in a bad delivery 'I can teach you the ways of the Force' One of the strong but also weak points 0f the film is its very strong use in visual effects including CGI and editing. This consists of some remarkable scenery to be admired, but it is very repetitive and could make one dizzy.Overall X-Men Apocalypse is very entertaining, and is fourth out of eighth' place in the series. I understand its hard to always top the previous film, but this still doesn't quite reach the momentum of Future Past or First Class, but is still very good. 8/10",6,6,13,20 May 2016
Coco," Remember This one
","Pixar return in a death defying new magical tale: CocoEntering the wonderful Mexican culture of Día de Muertos or Day of the Dead. Director: Lee Unkrich, the outstanding creator of Toy Story 3 (2010), packs the same emotional punch through the magnificent Spanish tradition in a beautiful and heart melting story.Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez) aspires to be a musician in his home Santa Cecilia, Mexico, but as part of his family history, song and music have been condemned forever. Unable to fight his dream, during the Day of the dead, Miguel finds himself in reach of his idol: Ernesto de la Cruz's (Benjamin Bratt), guitar which transports him into the land of the dead, becoming visible to his remembered ancestors. To help Miguel figure out how he can make it back to land of the living is the 'unforgettable' Hector (Gael García Bernal) a rickety skeleton trying to reach the land of the living but is fading from the memories of his own family. As always baffles me is Pixar's astonishing talent in compacting the laughs, the story, and tears in exquisite animation pictures. The animation's studio's 19th film shows that they've never lost the magic. In unique territory then before, but still bringing all you'd expect, Coco will be regarded as another animated classic. Although Coco hasn't revolutionized the customary storytelling, Coco still becomes a wonderful and beautiful work, doing that Pixar thing in a new and interesting form.At its core is the virtuous chronicle about remembering, and family, a touching look into heritage,and identity. An emotional driving force of memory really brings out the tears in the expected heart-wrenching moments. Even more successful is the film honourable achievement of taking this rather delicate subject matter and producing it in a playful and joyful fashion. Pixar execute this tremendously surrounded by the ravishing and colourful imagery of the land of the dead, as well as the laugh out loud jokes (one at the beginning, which if you have any extended European family, will find hilarious.) As always with Pixar humor is the slapstick, against the hilarity of the funny yet poignant laughs part of the film's universal appeal.Similar, to a previous 2017 animated feature, (The LEGO Batman Movie), Coco does become a very energetic film, in early rushes and excitement to get going with the plot. This is only minor nit-pic, but just moments I wanted it to just take its time, which is better than wanting the film to hurry up.
More distant from its regular works, Coco still keeps in tact with its own ancestors, like Ratatouille (2007) (embracing the delicious French culture) investing in the wonderful Spanish society, or Monsters Inc. (2001) (bringing to life and civilizing, the whimsical world of monsters) beautifully visualising and fabricating the land of the dead. Furthermore bringing that home grown family love that all Pixar works provide. Of course there is significant resemblance to the 2014 animated adventure The Book of Life, which if you enjoyed then I 'm sure your love Coco . The film also echoes moments from 2016's stop motion picture Kubo and the Two Strings, with similar emotional background.Pixar's latest masterwork is an exceptional tribute to family and ancestry, in a new but also traditional form. For those who find themselves at this point in a mournful state, I truly believe Coco will be an uplifting and celebratory watch in remembrance of the ones we loose, but never forget. A fantastically moving creation by the brilliant animated magicians, Pixar yet again create an exceptional piece of cinema, to be relished by all.",10,0,1,20 January 2018
Sing Street," A funny, remarkable, touching and charming musical story.
","John Carney the director of other musical dramas such as Once and Begin Again has introduced the very enjoyable funny romance story of Conor, a teen living in heavy 80's Dublin, who becomes enchanted by the mysterious Raphina. But for the young lad to have a chance with the young lady, Conor says he's in a band and wants her to be in a music video, in which he must now in a haste build a band and start developing a video.What you're invited to in this 80's music celebration is a very enjoyable cliché drama that explores the history of pop and rock with the combination of trying to fit in at school. A coming of age story for young nippers during exposure to artists such as Duran Duran, A Ha, and Motörhead. Sing Street also introduces brilliant fun original songs that you can't but help but just have a great time with.The moment I truly decided how great this film is, was during the amazing gratifying performance scene of 'Drive It Like You Stole It', followed by the inspiring 'Brown Shoes' With great, smile inducing performances from new young actors including Ferdia Walsh-Peelo (Conor), Lucy Boyton (Raphina), along with the brilliant talent of Brenden Tayor; the protagonists older brother. But a complete charming and entertaining performance by the rest of the supporting cast, all providing quirky hysterics and characteristics.What only lacks the film is that its atmosphere compared with other British comedy drama that does not surprise and that as far as tone it does not stand out. During viewing I couldn't help but cast my mind to film's like Submarine, and Nowhere Boy, but it does become distinctive in its own sense as the film further develops.So Sing Street is a very remarkable and enjoyable story, with great fun music, and wonderful charming performances. I would probably call this the British version of School of Rock, but still quite a stand out musical drama. 8.6/10",9,1,2,17 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force has properly Awaken
","The 8th chapter in the newly resurrected Star Wars series, is a rollercoaster of an adventure, filled with the unexpected fun, twist and turns that have been delightfully introduced by Rian Johnson. What you would expect is not what is given to you, in the most whimsical Star Wars film to date.Following from the end of the Force Awakens, we find Rey attempting to bring Luke Skywalker out of hiding to help the battle against the vicious First Order, but Skywalker himself does not seek to return, as his own past has defined him as he insists on staying in the dark. Meanwhile General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) leads the resistance in escape from the First Order in deep space, where Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Hux ( Domhnall Gleeson) won't rest till they are finally destroy them.As a life long Star Wars fan, it was regrettable when I went to see The Force Awakens two years ago, and coming out feeling very disappointed. After a couple more views, I have been able to enjoy the film, but still find several issues with it, that haven't made it the Star Wars film for me. I have to admit though that the ending, with reveal of Rey's power and that final appearance of Mark Hamil did have me anticipating in glee for the next chapter of the series. With a darker appearance than the previous film, and a different director: Rian Johnson, I have been very excited about the promise of The Last Jedi.As the caption 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away' emerged I had a sudden shiver of joy (as did it last time). Unfortunately soon after, I found myself thinking its was going in the same direction of the Force Awakens, with the same issues occurring.We start with a rather choppy beginning in the establishment of our characters, that created a great disturbance in the balance of things. This was only pre-mature but stood out to ne. Again we have frequent moments of on the nose dialogue, that may sound good on paper, but through certain delivery is not. There is also have middle subplot with Finn (Jon Boyega) and new rebel character Rosa ( that doesn't really land on its feet and eventually becomes a waste of time just to fit into the 152 minute runtime.We furthermore have the return of the endless string of laugh out loud jokes and quirks that turn it almost into comedy, charming to some maybe, but not for this fan. Star Wars at its core is film about the struggle of good vs evil which I and I'm sure many fans take seriously, but its very hard to take it serious if the film isn't half the time. Its not just the cute humour with BB-8 but there are times during critical conversation, that it appears a custard pie has to be thrown. I know if you take any Marvel film you could pick out a hundred moments of humour, but there's something about the humour in the latest Star Wars films, which just ruins it for me, it pulls me out of this fantasy and draws attention to the artificial construction.That being said what Star Wars The Last Jedi wonderfully succeeds as a fun, action pack, adventure, character drama, and I am over joyed to say for myself, as a Star Wars film.A Bold and original take for the Star Wars series, The Last Jedi at last becomes its very own film, in a inventive war drama, taking you places you would never expect to find yourself. From a brilliant dramatic tension between, Rey and Luke, to Ren's desperation to prove himself to Supreme Leader Snoke, and the resistance struggling to work cooperatively against the First Order. This is mostly held together by Mark Hamill's stand out performance as the broken Jedi master, in his heart-rendering eyes and stares, Hamill, perfectly embodies an aging Skywalker, lost of hope for the rest of the galaxy. This is the key heart that drives the soul of the film. Furthermore Driver brings a much stronger an more powerful performance in Kylo Ren, especially when opposite his counterpart Rey, with Daisy Ridley also bringing a more thriving performance.Of course opposite Johnson's brialliant storytelling, is a range of fantastic action, including some sensational space dog fights, planet battles and as always exhilarating lighsaber battles. The Last Jedi, almost never rests in its continuous array of action making it one of the most action packed Star Wars films yet.What I wanted for The Force Awakens is exactly what I got in the Last Jedi with its own story, still with certain shouts to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but still a new chapter to remember. As also similar to last year's spin off film Rogue One, The Last Jedi, properly begins and ends with a monumental final third act This is where the new Star Wars era finally become Star Wars for me. The film represents the change and innovation which the filmmakers are presumably planning to bring into a new Star Wars generation.Star Wars The Last Jedi has now thankfully awakened the force in me, as to appreciate this new Star Wars era. It does still suffer from a several flaws within narrative structure, and my personal quarrels, but managed to bring out the real Star Wars fan in me. An incredible and enjoyable watch, The force is very strong with this one.",8,234,445,15 December 2017
Jurassic World," Almost the same to the original and very predictable
","They cloned dinosaurs and tried to make them a theme park attraction, it went wrong, research teams tried to examine the remains, it went wrong. Now they've remade the park, with more dangerous creatures lurking around, what could possible go wrong? THIS!! Instead of moving on from the idea of a dinosaur petting zoo, the managers of the park believe it can still work with no loose dinosaurs. However, the idiot scientist think it will be no danger to breed their own dinosaur with a mixture of different creature DNA. So eventually a highly intelligent blood thirsty dinosaur becomes loose around Jurassic World.The film is completely fuelled with intense, pulse racing action that Jurassic Park delivered only bigger and louder. Although it is new I did believe that the film is almost the exact same feature to the original, with the exceptions of a slightly different narrative and several annoying characters.The film does present though an interesting narrative, and brilliant visual effects. There is also a small emotional theme to the story of the relationship between the dinosaurs and humans, which I think Chris Pratt executes brilliantly.Sadly the film becomes very predictable with other themes presented throughout the story, and becomes infested in plot wholes. Throughout watching it I could not help but think WHY? To the characters as they perform stupid actions and not even do the sensible thing. There are also moments of intense gory images and disturbing scenes, which make men question the certificate of the film but also nearly made me believe I was watching a horror movie.Overall to me the film was just exhausting, familiar, and annoying. However the film provides what it promises and I'm sure will entertain fans of the previous films. I give it 5/10.",6,40,83,21 August 2015
Cold War," A Cold War Romance
","Pawel Pawlikowski's Cannes hit is a tragic romance in background of the Cold War. After winning the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film for Ida (2013), the Polish director pays tribute to his parents with a love story threatened by historic conflict. Its rather poignant for me to be seeing and hearing outrageously positive things about Pawlowski's latest film, as my own university; Oxford Brookes has been once been home of teaching for the director. Although I haven't myself had the pleasure to be lectured by the man himself, his education in film is reaching me through his craft and non-more superbly shown then through Cold War.While recruiting a group of Polish citizens to perform communist propaganda songs in a traveling concert, composer Wiktor Warski (Tomasz Kot) becomes infatuated with a peasant girl Zulu (Joanna Kulig) rumored to have killed her father. As their secret love is kept hidden during the tour, Warski and Zulu struggle to find true happiness in their bond while the events of the Cold War unfold over 15 years.Loosely based on the lives of his parents, Pawilowski takes us on an powerful journey into war and love simultaneously. As Zulu and Warski cross paths over different sides of the Iron curtain their attraction to each over is invaded by their political contexts that prevent them from being together. You could easily mistake this couple for Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman from Casablanca (1943).Its not just the central romance that rings the bell of Rick's CafÃ©, but indeed in the look and feel of the film the golden age of cinema is seeping out. Pawel Pawlowski's takes us back to a more traditional form of cinema with a 1:33 ratio, black and white, and more classical cinematography from Lukasz Zal. We are transported back in time, with Zal's camerawork with movements and stills that could very well have come from films from the same era.The central performers of Kulig and Kot bring authentic and immersive energy to their roles, building a beautiful relationship that we are engrossed by for the entire film. But its Joanne Kulig's electrifying performance that's the stand out. From her journey to small peasant girl to a concert star is a natural as the flourishing of a flower. One sequence with Kulig's Zulu dancing in a bar is poetry itself.Cold War's jazz soundtrack is narration of the story itself with an early melody about a forbidden love already foreshadowing the star crossed lover's tale. With some unforgettable music sequences in the dark smoke room clubs with glimpses of tormented eyes of Zulu as she sings. You can almost see a lot of Damien Chazelle's La La Land (2016) in the nightclub scenes.Pawlikowski's portrayal of love in war is a masterful construction of beauty and melancholy, led by the wonderful central performances. A tale that says much more with its visual than dialogue another pure testimonial to cinema itself as well as the director's parents. Marvellous.",10,15,29,7 October 2018
Logan," One of the most sophisticate 'super hero' films of all time
","After 7 films, Hugh Jackman still proves, we can never get enough of his wild uncanny wolverine.Continuing in the newly adjusted X Men timeline, Logan is set in the year 2029, where mutants have become and endangered race, and Xaviar's school for the gifted has disappeared. Wolverine, or Logan (Hugh Jackman) now makes a living as a limo driver, as he tends to the needs of the fading Charles Xaviar (Patrick Stewart), who is suffering from his own telepathic psychic trauma, causing the entire earth to shake. But soon Logan comes across a mysterious girl who is more familiar to him than he knows as he embarks on a journey to protect her and take her to a safe Eden for her kind.After last year's below average, but satisfying X Men Apocalypse, James Mangold concludes the Wolverine story with a cold hearted bloody violent neo- western, standing out from the crowed against all super hero films.To be perfectly honest, this isn't really a super hero film at all, and is actually more of mature action drama. With its 15 certificate, Logan takes the advantage that Deadpool brought in which it can finally exploit and deliver the R rated bloody violence fans have deserved from Wolverine for ages. When the violence comes, it comes hard core, with 20th Century Fox making as much use of the certificate as they can. This however gives Logan its fuel for it to be what it is, which is a sophistical written piece of drama, standing alone but as a part of the X Men franchise.This comes at rare moments when the film stops being itself and just takes time to be human, and capture a warm essence through the characters and story. But which is then taken back to its routes with its mainstream action. Which isn't a bad thing, it rather balances the drama, and action very well.Entering a whole new side of the character of Logan that we have got to know so well. Jackman gives his shinning performance as Wolverine by far, collaborating all the effort and history that the character has delt with in all the films to create a clear and understandable portrayal. We see a crystal clear life led by Logan as he struggles to find peace in a life with out peace, and then sparing another of the same by attempting to give them a life without the misery he has lived.Stewart also particularly shines, in giving us a new and completely different angel of Professor X, being one of the factors that the film reminds us that we are not living in a comic book, but the real world. Stepen Merchant plays Caliban who sportingly shines, and you barely recognise the popular comedic actor, even if he didn't have the pale skin. One of the most important cast member is Dafne Keen who with so little movement in her facial expressions does so much in her eyes that we really see her shy childness but also aggressive mutant abilities emit.The film does unfortunately at times struggle to find things to do, trying to keep with in its 2hr 20min length, it reaches certain points where feels slightly with no direction, but does not reach any sense of boredom at all, and eventually finds real strong purpose.What you eventually find is a film which is very much substance and style, in a good balance, with a surprising emotional atmosphere throughout recognising its audience journey with the character of Logan, and then resulting in a melancholy tale that will bring tears to the fans.Logan is a powerful action drama, with well balanced story and action, with the best performance of Wolverine by Jackman, which is something new and outstanding from all super hero films. 9.0",9,2,6,5 March 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," Open the pod bay doors Hal and enter an astonishing experience.
","Stanley Kubrick's mesmerising masterpiece goes into the deep reaches of the universe., and becomes an ambiguous crusade through the nature of humanity. Before Star Wars, there was 2001, before J.A.R.V.I.S, there was HAL 9000, and before Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan there was Stanley Kubrick. A combination of Spielberg's AI, Nolan's Interstellar, with a bit of Terrence Malik's The Tree of Life, 2001 reigns high as one of the most influential innovative and stunning science fiction movies of all time.When the Discovery One makes its exploration to Jupitar Space, the shuttle super computer HAL 9000 takes control of the mission himself (or itself), while Kubrick takes us on an revolutionary journey from the origins of man to beyond the Universe, as we witness Kubrick's vision of the development and evolution human existence.An outstanding cinematic masterpiece that reveals true originality at its heart, with an experience to remember that leaves you in a shocking and mind-blowing condition. Victims to listening to one of the most epic dramatic scores of all time by Alex North, we awaken into the dark mystical ruling space. Our journey is magnificently shot through the beauty and artistry of Geoffrey Unsworth, really drawing us into the stars and beyond. But also the masterful perfectly executed editing by Ray Lovejoy that professionally shows us how we jump from the dawn of time to the futuristic world of space travel.What Kubrick wonderfully uses to itch our minds with, is the creativity and complexity put forward into the several mysterious objects that wonder the universe. For example the startling simplicity but so complicated appearance of the Black Monolith, and the stone cold terrorising voice of Douglas Rain capturing the essence of the intelligent and apprehensive entity of HAL 9000.What faithfully won the Academy Award for best visual effects in 1969, shows off the strength of technology at the end of 60s. Though it is limited and dated compared to today's capabilities, you can't help but become engulfed through visual poetry. From the God like aerial shot of the humble earth, the atmospheric landings and movement of the cosmic space ships, to the breath-taking sequence of the star gate, 2001 is a pure alive artwork.2001 A Space Odyssey is a landmark event in film history and sits consistently on one of the thrones of science fiction. A triumphant masterpiece seeping into unknown realms of not just space, but also film history. A odyssey indeed into the extraordinary 10/10",10,2,4,18 October 2016

As the two build off each others dreams, both enter the majestic land of love, dreams and music.Damien Chazelle thrills us again in a sublime musical wonder after the intense drama: Whiplash, Chazelle dazzles us with a happy celebration of music. After the dark perspective of the Jazz world, Chazelle gives us the other end of the spectrum, with the celebratory joy of jazz through the passionate Sebastian, opposite a display of the labour in Hollywood through Mia's ambition to be an actress.What we find the film taking us on is a massive tribute to Hollywood golden cinema age from the 30s-50s. Enjoy all the layered reference and hat tip to Gene Kelly's lamppost dancing Singin' in the Rain (1952), and monumental epilogue attributing An American in Paris,(1951) to the underlining echoes of Casablanca (1942), From its overwhelming screen presence, La La Land is marvellous treat for the eyes, consisting of unforgettable set piece designs and locations combined with stunning colour schemes in scenery and costume. This of course is the setting for the magnificent soundtrack of songs. From the eccentric 'Another Day of Sun' from the start, to heart tugging 'Audition' La La land contains amazing original music about reach for the star Brilliant cinematography by Linus Sandgren, who guides in a fluent vibrant city in a sensational visual presence especially during the songs, particular opening with Birdman endless take around the dancing traffic drivers.

Life Is Beautiful," A very extraordinary life story in making the best of a bad situation.
","La vita è bella (Life is Beautiful) is the 1997 Italian comedy drama directed and starring Roberto Benigni about the constant over the moon father who becomes determined to distract his son from the horrors of the holocaust when captured and taken to a concentration camp. Receiving 7 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, and winning 3 for Best Actor, Original score and Foreign language film, it is rightly so to this unbelievable masterpiece. Life is Beautiful exceptionally defies controversy by bringing comic value to a delicate subject which it very successfully executes, combining the strong power of comedy and emotion in the same package.Guido Orefice (Benigni) is the most joyous and glee filled Italian waiter in Italy and arrives to his Uncle's home town to work in his restaurant where he twice falls (quite literally) head over high heels for the lovely 'princess' Dora with whom he is certain is the one. When life moves blissfully on, Guido and his son Giosuè get captured and sent to a concentration camp. However, to spare his son from the truth about where they are, Guido convinces his son that they are part of a game and must gain 1000 point to win.With an absolutely wonderful performance by Benigni, Life is Beautiful swirls us into a fabulous new world to look for all the happiness that dwells in the darkness. As well as effectively portraying a fun loving father, Benigni perfectly presents his dedication and care as a father to his son even in the hardest times.What makes the film unique, is the sensational blend of pleasant satire and heart melting drama, a rare success. Although you think at first, that the film is going to be easy to watch charming slapstick humour, it gently moves you into its rather delicate subject matter but making it still an easy watch. This also supported by the charming Oscar winning score by Nicola Piovani.Another star of the show is Giorgio Cantarini who plays Giosuè, phenomenally expressing the whole experience through his eyes and as we are driven along with the story we feel attached to the lie that Guido states and feel a softening tone to the situation.Life is Beautiful is a very extraordinary piece of film and a very daring make, but perfectly accomplished, deserving everything it received. An unforgettable film that does something that many other films haven't. An absolute must see. 10/10",10,0,2,7 October 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Disney can still work the magic even out of the animation studio, and 26 years later after a treasured classic.
","Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, The Fifth Estate, and Mr Holmes) re-invents the wonderfully powerful fantasy tale of Beauty and the Beast, continuing Disney's mission to make live action versions of their classic films. Re-introducing the lovely story of love and beauty that we all treasure, Disney have created a fine piece of work that reminds us of our passion for the story.As we all know Belle (Emma Watson) is a intelligent girl a head of her time, who is snatched from her ordinary life, into the mysterious world of the Beast (Dan Stevens), when her farther is taken kidnapped by him and she takes his place. But as she discovers the secrets of the Beast's castle and furniture she and the Beast find something that wasn't there before. See what I did? In a visually magnificent presence, the story we love is moved pleasantly onto the live action screen in a colourful and enjoyable experience. Of course not replacing the original masterpiece, the film has its own merits as its own re-telling. These new live action films are not here to replace our memories but show them in the real world instead of animation. I hold that the same magic is equally qualified but with the advancements of technology in filmmaking, the magic that animation could only portray can be seen in real life form.Emma Watson is the perfect Belle, with no other actor coming to mind to replace her, with her lovely appearance and character fuelling and taking lead of her performance, Watson is an absolute pleasure. Dan Stevens apparently taking the role of the Beast but is too layered in CGI and voice adaptors to tell its him, but somehow making perfect sense when his flesh self is seen. Not forgetting the jewel of the story but the living furniture of Lumière (Ewan McGregor) Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), Mrs Potts (Emma Thompson), all shinning still amazingly all the household appliances that we'd love to own.Luke Evans steals the show as Gaston , really showing off his self centred, boasting character combined with the humorous match of Josh Glad as LeFou, who's secret is clear but barley as shocking as claimed.What can be said about Beauty and the Beast (2017) is that a it is a very justified and fine reminder of why we love Beauty and the Beast (1991). Not to say that its not good on its own, on the contrary it is a very enjoyable delight with its majestic music sequences that captures the magic perfectly. But its just not the Disney classic.The film has added its own additions and side bits, which unfortunately bring very little to the film and could be removed with no difference but are still perfectly fine anyway. At times I couldn't help but look at the film and think that's it was very set piece-y and not as real as it would like to be. Personally I thought I was watching a theatre play at moments.The Beauty and the Beast song remains as indestructible as ever, but is challenged by Emma Thompson's slightly over sold accent, but does not stir away from the magic. By the end of the film you re-discover the power and love of the story.At the end of the day, Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful experience that I'm sure will be enjoyed, but just won't match the power of the original, and sometimes too loud in its scenery but none the less an absolute delight. 7.5",7,1,6,18 March 2017
Sicario," A real message hidden in perfect film making.
","Emily Blunt stars in the magnificent cold hearted crime thriller that brings us into the world of the FBI war against drug cartel. A solid directing work by Denis Villeneuve, who brought us Prisoners, Enemy and the up coming science fiction Arrival entering a cinematic display of down to earth drama.Kate Macer (Blunt) is an FBI agent who is brought into the task force team against drug cartel between the American and Mexican border. As Macer enters a world she is not used she consistently questions the activity of her task force leader (Josh Brolin) and the true objective of their job. She is also becomes the colleague with the mysterious Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) who is much more then meets the eye.What is at the true centre of Sicario lies in Blunt's performance as the strong FBI enforcer but also is the troubled and confused member of an enterprise she is not sure about. Blunt is the cold hearted soul of the film as we join her through her in the expeditions through the borders. What Blunt holds strong is her authoritative persona especially opposite her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), along with her vulnerable unknowing sympathetic character.The other key master-class performer is Benicio del Toro delivering a brilliant dark and puzzling character with a past displayed only in the behaviour of his face. A true silhouette throughout the film especially in the first second he is seen, with much mystery and truth rapped up in inside. What you also have is the spot on laid back task force leader, role by Josh Brolin avoiding any questions about their activity by Blunt, and taking the serious matter in front of them far too lightly and at ease.What also makes Sicario a significant piece of cinema is its cinematic presence displaying spectacular aerial and establishing shots of Mexico's desert lands, beautifully done by Roger Deakins making the film more than a standard drama. Bringing heart thumping and strong atmospheric sound to the table is also Jóhann Jóhannsson's sensational score, expressing the dramatic and tense themes.Sicario is derived from the Mexican term for hit-man, in which the film suggest to be the real truth behind the enforcement of the task forces, meaning for them to be terrorising killers entering the innocent homelands of the local towns people. Here we find Villeneuve reaching out to the audience and revealing hidden truth behind war against the drug cartel.A brilliant work in film making and a great message in a marvellous form with a great visual presence. 9.3/10",9,1,2,29 October 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Somewhere between Age of Ultron and Doctor Strange
","The MCU continues by returning one of the greatest things about 2014, but of course facing a great danger, living up to the first one.We find our mismatched reckless Guardians on a job protecting the high Sovereign from a giant shark squid thing with Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) dancing to Mr Blue Sky creating another iconic musical opening in a more dramatic but fun sequence. From there, our main leader Star Lord (Chris Pratt) gets re-acquainted with his long lost father played very pleasantly by Kurt Russell and as before a whole heap of trouble awaits.As far as what happens beyond that point is not for me to reveal of course, but it is very hard to explain as the plot doesn't seem to actually choose a direction. I know this is really what should be expected of this half comedy half science fiction adventure but it was something that the first one got. However where Guardians lacks in narrative it heavily makes up for in laughs.What I believe James Gunn and the rest of his writers and producers have done is basically thought: Wow the fans love that combination of comedy and action, lets just do that classic sequel thing and crank that up to 10. This would usually be a criticism but Guardians 2 gets away with it. Obviously it does not match the magic of the first film, but satisfies very much as a sequel. But the film is not just surface, the film really takes its time to express this meaning of family which is actually really moving and provides more layers and atmosphere to the characters than the first one did. It takes a similar pathway to Star Trek Beyond, story-wise and structurally securing itself as great popcorn entertainment.Like what the LEGO Batman Movie did, the jokes never stop coming, consisting of many laugh out loud subtle and visible jokes but also a lot of jokes that don't really cause much response and quickly die, but enough for you to most certainly pass the Kermode and Mayo's six laugh test. A little too many laughs particularly coming from Drax in this one.The entire cast returns with a clear joy and privilege to be there as they each steal minutes of the screen to show off their wacky personalities, from Drax's maniac laughing warrior, to Rocket's quick witted sharp shooting genius. Russell chews up the script in his own manner, but Sylvester Stallone's brief appearance is nothing to get excited about.Now earlier, as I mentioned the cranking it up to 10, Guardians 2 mostly certainly accomplishes this through its visuals, which create a rainbow themed colour scheme for the galaxy and show off more corners unknown to its audience. The action becomes non-stop as well, with little moments for you to take a breather. During the final act of the film, I do believe I felt the spirit of the comics come alive. But they got to fill that extra 15 minutes with something, which I personally feel they could loose. At times I wanted the film to move pace slightly as the film felt like it was just killing time on several occasions. Certainly never boring but just could move quickly at points. But I shouldn't really complain when a lot of this time is filled to add more layers our characters.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a very fun and enjoyable time but much louder on its visuals, humor, and action. It would certainly not be disappointing to the Marvel fans, may not be the first film but its not Thor the Dark World (wink wink). 8.4/10",8,1,5,30 April 2017
The Shape of Water," Del Toro's new moving, thrilling romantic fantasy
","If I was to tell you about Guillermo Del Toro's new film what would I say.As the father of dark fantasy, Guillermo Del Toro knows how to bring alive the illusive wonderlands and nightmares we can relish and transform them into wonderful poignant crafts of insight and meaning, and The Shape of Water is no exception. With its journey from Venice to Toronto, The Shape of Water has now hit the London Film Festival, now within reach of this exuberant critic. I had only the budget to see one film at this year's festival and I most certainly made a wise decision.During the Cold War conflict of the 60s, a mute but hearing Eliza (Sally Hawkins) works as a cleaner at a secret government facility, where she becomes drawn to the new specimen: a mysterious marine creature (Doug Jones). While Eliza begins to fall in love with it, the facility head Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), only desires to take the creature apart for experimental advantage against the Russians. Eliza's bond with the creature soon begins to effect those around her: her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins), work college Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and scientist Robert Hoffsteder (Michael Stuhbarg) What is amazing profound about Del Toro's latest work is its eccentric visualisation in reflection of the political and social conceptions of the past , but also today. The most centralised end is the the treatment of those who are different. Directly dealing with the fantasy of other species but intertwined with racial treatment relevant to the time in which the film is set, and then of course against the back drop of the national conflicts, but then also the value of those with deficiencies, as portrayed by Sally Hawkins.More distant from his darker tones in, Pan's Labyrinth, and Crimson Peak, but not far from the surreal fantasy, The Shape of Water becomes more grounded than previous Del Toro films, and diversely more lighter and funnier. With frequent laughs and jokes on screen, the romantic fantasy is a much light hearted watch, of course not without its moment of bloody violence but at a lower volume. What may be hard for some audiences to get their head around, is this idea of an inter-species relations and with the astonishing design of the creature itself becomes something more than just a fish costume. The bond and sexuality of this romance is a significant thread to the film and is one that featured heavily with its repetitive moments of adult content. But what Del Toro explores its is real beauty in love and within the context of the film it does becomes something remarkable.Sally Hawkins is exceptional in her vigorous performance as the mute Eliza, with dynamic sign language and spirited facial expressions, we see the isolated heart of the 'princess without voice' which makes her connection to this solitary creature all the more real. Opposite her is the confident physical actor Doug Jones, manning the rubber suit of the creature in a brilliant bodily performance, outdoing his previous collaborative performances with Del Toro. Then Michael Shannon sensationally brings the real monster to the tale in Strickland, the dominating Colonel facing his battle in masculinity as well as with the creature. Shannon gives one of the best performances of his career, keeping with that classic fairy tale juxtaposition of man being the real monster.As with all Del Toro's dark fantasies, it all becomes about the characters. Eliza reaching out to another like herself. Strickland trying to maintain his power and masculinity in his skirmish with the creature and Eliza. Hoffsetider being caught between to sides but seeking his own right, and Giles trying to find his significance back in society.As never fails with a Del Toro films is the signature production design that brings to life these magnificent worlds. The Shape of Water although is not full Del Tory fairy tale land, does have a very extraordinary construct of the real world, from Eliza's apartment to the secret facility, echoing the true Gothic universe of the real world. Opening in a momentous title sequence, Del Toro literally floods the screen in ravishing visual effects and segments. Only more so combined with the inescapable talents of cinematographer: Dan Laustsen, swiftly moving from one room to the next in a mythical immersive experience alluring us furthermore into the depths of the story and art work of the film.The Shape of Water is a wonderfully weird, quirky, heart-warming, extraordinary piece of cinema. For fans who have found Del Toro's previous works too dark or scary, will be delighted by this much more charming fantasy.",10,108,246,13 October 2017
Pitch Perfect 2," The Barden Bellas' are back, higher pitched than before, and with less irritating personalities than before.
","In film and television, there is always some fun, humorous, musical franchise out there. First there was High School Musical, then Glee, but now those have been 'PITCH SLAPPED'.Funnier, better story structure, and less annoying. Following their success from the first film the girls, must again prove to the world of their talents, with some bumps along the way, but nothing that music and friendship can't fix.However, to the perhaps aged, and experienced viewer the film may consists of humour that is unsuccessful, maybe even offencive, poorly thought out script, potentially a recognised story line.Although the film is still fun for all families over 12, and is definitely one to be proud of when you exit the cinema. I give the film a 7/10 and recommend it to all people with a passion of music, and sometimes want to see what University life doesn't look like (50% a joke).",6,4,12,28 May 2015
The Secret Life of Pets," Pure Enjoyment
","As soon as I saw the first teaser trailer for this film, I knew that I would see it. I didn't care whether it would be good or not I was determined to see it and I can happily say the film delivered exactly what it promises.Illumination Entertainment who were responsible for Despicable Me have again created a very entertaining piece of animation that will be tickling you through out the hour and half duration. Now you may think that this is basically Toy Story with pets, and you would be right it is, but the film is still new and exciting in its own way.The Secret Life Of Pets follows the lives of various household pets from dogs to rabbits to birds to crocodiles when their owners are not home. We focus particularly on Max a Jack Russell Terrier who becomes ambushed by a new dog Duke who is to be his brother, but when the two don't get along to start, they will get lost in their home city, (which is meant to be NY) and work together to get home. Also pursuing them is their close friends and a maniac rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart.To get straight to the point, the film is very enjoyable and entertaining and funny to be enjoyed by children and older audiences as well. The film is not a masterpiece like Inside Out or The LEGO Movie and doesn't have as much depth as Zootropolis, but it is a fun time at the cinema.It starts of with a very nice establishing tracking shot of the animated city which is very pleasant to look at, and does frequently provide admirable views through out of the landscape. There is also sweetness to it in the relationships between the pets and their owners shown in two montages. All the voice actors also do a splendid job in their role and provide the perfect voices for their characters. With the jokes, there are proper funny jokes and not just plain slapstick, but their is a lot of that. I will say there were moments where the faces of the different characters just brought a smile to my face.However there are still some flaws. There are too many characters that try all to have their moments, and after a while we kind of forget about them and they are just there. There are smaller stories going on in the film which don't quite meet the climax they are built up to be. Finally, the film does have potential in particular moments to give the film the emotion and depth needed but it doesn't quite flow that way.I will say I probably would have enjoyed the film even more, but I surrounded by the most annoying people ever in a cinema. So to sum up it s very entertaining and funny, a good time at the cinema, but not a masterpiece in animated family films. 7.7/10",7,5,9,9 July 2016
Finding Dory," How the hell do Pixar do it?
","After 13 years Pixar have been cooking up something amazing.Finding Dory is the sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo (A Disney Classic). A year later Marlin, Nemo, and Dory are living peacefully together until Dory begins to remember her family and becomes determined to seek out her parents.Directed by Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, A Bugs Life, WALL E), Pixar have resurrected a classic animation and brought it to new depth. Supported by a outstanding new team f voice actors, Finding Dory introduces hilarious new characters to enjoy. In Finding Nemo, Dory's short term memory loss was touched upon and joked about, but now we have the real tragic emotional story behind Dory's memory problem, which really makes you feel for the character. What is also most unique is remarkable score by Thomas Newman, which is so good I didn't even have to listen out for it to hit me.Of course without Pixar, there also comes the marvellous comedy made me laugh very frequently, out loud ad well. But what makes the film is the emotional story of Dory losing her parents which is made up by numerous powerful emotional moments which was twice close to drawing tears from my eyes.Lets be honest, this film was not made for children of the current generation, but for all of us who witnessed the first film 13 years ago. Only we can purely understand the emotional depth of the film.The film however does try to do too many things as once, in being a sequel, but also its own film, and hence becomes unbalanced in trying to create the theme of the first film, but also new and independent. Both are good but together can make the film messy.What makes Finding Dory shy away from being perfect is its unbalance but also certain scenes that have a mixture of humour and emotion which sometimes spoils the atmosphere. But just for once couldn't Pixar try to just aim to be mature audience film, so the easy child friendly atmosphere wasn't there so the film could be perfect with depth and comedy on an older scale.But how do Pixar do it? in creating beautiful, fun, and marvellous films which we will never forget. Finding Dory is amazing, exactly what we love in animated films, and is just brilliant but not quite perfect. 8.9/10",9,2,8,7 August 2016
Arrival," A modern Science fiction masterpiece
","This is why I fell in love with film, plain and simple, this film right here is the reason.This is not the average sci fi you think it is, it most definitely is not my friend, this is a pure masterpiece in film and science fiction combined, and honestly the best film of 2016. Adapted from Ted Chiang's short story 'Story of your Life' into cinema at its very best.When earth is suddenly startled by the arrival of mysterious pebble shaped space crafts or 'shells', Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called in to assist in contacting with the lifeforms that dwell within. Using her knowledge of language and translation her and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) become the interpreters of the world as they try to learn and communicate with the extraterrestrial beings that are visiting the planet.A marvellous masterpiece at the hands of Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario, and Enemy), who seems to create pure cinematic artwork in any situation, whether its cartel war, scary kidnapping thriller, and now he has proved that he can do with science fiction, I very much looking forward to the upcoming Blade Runner 2049. Sharing a similar theme and structure to the works of Christopher Nolan, the French Canadian director has created a compelling science fiction blockbuster that treats its audience with intelligence and respect. Also feeling familiar vibes from the works of Ridley Scott and the great Stanley Kubrick.Arrival is artwork, one of the greatest piece of modern science fiction, and must be appreciated for it, with all usually element that make a film a film being absolutely magnificent. From the opening tilt shot that very slowly zooms in, you know that this is going to be an amazing and stunning watch. Like The Revenant 50% of the this film is the cinematography by Bradford Young, telling its very own story in every single shot. Every scene is a piece of artwork itself (literally) presenting the melancholy atmosphere that Villeneuve is a custom for doing. Especially in the scenes where we enter he valley of mystery we are so glued to the screens and engulfed by what we see. There is a phenomenal circulating aerial shot over the open field where the main shell hangs with the mystic white cloud floating in the air. Every shot where the shell is seen, there is the unsettling sinister vibe that is emitted, similar to the black Monolith.But what secondly really empowers and makes up 15% of the film is Jóhann Jóhannsson's score, another key aspect that journeys us into the story. This a literal face melting score, (I promise you my face really melted). This is what also takes me back to the music as featured in Blade Runner and 2001, and also Sicario. This combined with the camera and editing made me fall in love with the film. It contains of the most intelligent pieces of editing work (Joe Walker).At the very heart of Arrival is the story, the solid heavy idea of alien translation. This idea is one is never really focused on in alien arrival movies, and is most definitely pulls it off and even journeys into a cloudburst of wondrous, emotional, and insightful story telling. Being an Alien movie, Arrival also focuses the identity in humanity, reflecting a mirror at our political relations with other countries, and tries to brings us together in this event. Mark Kermode said that this is the best film to watch after the week we've had. There is a point where I was slightly unsure where the film was taking us, but by the end I was satisfied and happy to say that it contributed even more to whole effect of the film.Along with this is Amy Adam's spot on performance, it is only by the end of the film that I really appreciated her performance from the whole film. Viewing events truly through her eyes, we are encaptivated by what is happening, and are convinced that this is what would happen in real life. Jeremey Renner delivers his role as the standard good guy which creates remarkable chemistry with Amy Adams.If you see any film this year, make it Arrival, I don't care how much you want to see The Accountant, you goes see Arrival. You don't even have to be a massive science fiction fan. A solid and professional masterpiece. 10/10",10,7,18,12 November 2016
The Big Short," Stimulating, and very remarkable to watch.
","The Big Short is the riveting true story of the financial crises of 2008, with Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, and Brad Pitt. I will be honesty, the film is very economically wordy and hard to understand, even if the film itself tries to make it simpler. But that could be my age. Even though you may not get everything going on, you can get the rough gist, but you will not find yourself bored during the film.As well as the story the film is uniquely structured with breaking of the fourth wall, effective editing, and cinematography that gives the film a documentary feel, to make the story more real. So the film is really enjoyable to watch even if it is very talky. It even contains fun cameos of popular celebs to make a social atmosphere of the film. It also features great performances by Bale and Carell, who really demonstrate a clear believable characters.Even if your aware or not of the event, you will really be stunned by the story, from how it started to how it develops and how it ends, and the film really suggests this through the soundtrack, and mood.Although I wouldn't say that it is a must see, but definitely deserves praise, and will be enjoyed by people who are fond of biographical films, business related.The Big Short is a strong 8/10 and a very remarkable film to watch.",9,1,2,15 February 2016
Wonder Woman," The Right film for the Moment
","As the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) has not had a great track record so far, a lot of hope has been put into the Queen of the Amazons, and a very well done to director Patty Jenkins I have to say. It looks like there is hope for the DCEU after all.Ambitious Amazon Warrior Diana (Gal Gadot) seeks to fight for good and triumph over evil, but is restrained by her mother, until USA Army spy Steven Trevor (Chris Pine) accidentally lands in the hidden Amazon island, Diana fins her opportunity to become a great hero as Trevor tells about the great war of all wars bringing terror to his world. Accompanying him to the First World War, Diana is determined to bring an end to the suffering and promote piece.Not paying tribute the cheesy 70s show, Wonder Woman becomes its own film, fitting into the classic superhero criteria and being a mash up of others. Its Superman meets Thor, meets Captain America. Patty Jenkins has put the DCEU on track with a exciting, surprisingly fun adventure.Gal Gadot wielding the Lasso of truth, really invests in her character as a spectacular ambitious warrior princess but also a caring morally strong figure dedicated to bringing about peace. It is great to see probably the first great female superhero film, matching the quality of a classic marvel film, but also with no female gaze at all, and just so enriching to see this strong female lead be the driving force of power and good.Supporting her brave acts is Chris Pine being pretty much Chris Pine but not in a captain Kirk way, but as an admirable noble fighter, and love interest of the female lead, not a damsel in distress, just with amusing quirkiness.Although it starts fairly slow and shall I say a tad awkward in atmosphere, what escalates is a journey of gorgeous fun and thrills, really air punching excitement and joy. It may appear as another dark shady Snyder esc CGI parade is actually much more depend in its substance and values, but still including is grand a special effects performance. One of the great surprises was its heart and moral themes examining human nature and violence and war, which is mostly brought to life by the leading lady herself. With all that is going on in the world at the moment, I really do think we could all do with a bit of Diana Prince, encouraging us with high spirited drive for peace.What is one of it strengths is the fact that the film does take time to establish story and context, which is then beautifully combined with the grand action sequences. Maybe too many slow Mo action shots for my taste but still wonderfully put together thrilling set pieces. Accompanied by Rupert Gregson-Williams' music, we enter an empowering tone of heroics and spirit. As per usual, they just can't resist that big CGI ending, as we do bare witness to another explosive final act, that is not as heavy as BvS or mad as Man of Steal, but still remains part of this growing superhero tradition.What can only be said is just a great fun experience, and hope for the future of the DCEU. I do really hope to see more of Wonder Woman, and really do recommend this to be a encouraging film for the moment. It may be unlikely that is message will reach the whole world, but still acts n its own as an inspiring portrait. 8.4/10",8,3,7,5 June 2017
Mother!," A Mother!'s Nightmare
","Darren Aronofsky's disturbing nightmare parable horror-thriller, is a new masterclass work in cinematic depictions and narrative In the comforting urban paradise, separated from the rest of the world, a husband and wife's tranquil life is disturbed by the continues arrival of uninvited guests. 'Mother'(Jennifer Lawrence) becomes incapable of stopping the trespasses 'Him' (Javier Barden) graciously invites the people into their homes as means to create inspiration for his writing. But as tensions and distress begin to flood the house, transcendent rage rises in the heart of Mother! Aronofsky is very well known for his disturbing, surreal dark fantasies as shown by works like Black Swan, but Mother! is something else entirely. Never before has film like this been more alive cinematically. There is much to repel and divide audiences in the case of Mother!, what Aronofsky effectively achieves is moments of massive shock that may enrage audiences., but beyond the visual level is a much compelling nature.In the very soul of the film is Jenifer Lawrence, the active housewife to Javier Barden, determined to respect her husbands ambitions, but also break his writers block. In a very extraordinary view, we are never not by Lawrence's side as the camera creeps astonishing behind Lawrence's every move in extreme close ups and over the shoulder shots. Consistently always from her point of view, we are easily transported into the nauseating nightmare that becomes her world. Even as she seeks gentle comfort from her husband, Barden presence and behaviour only drags us further into the depth of the horror.Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are the first of the guests to arrive at the house, and from first contact immediately are most definitely no the company you want in your home. Pfeiffer is frustratingly terrific as the childlike, intrusive 'woman', with her nosy tendency to invading the couple's personal life which leaves 'mother's' aggressive lashes to be only responded by ignorance from the her husband and 'woman'.The haunting presence of location within the house is fascinatingly portrayed by Matthew Libatique's cinematography, although always in focus on Lawrence, creates the Gothic environment of the harrowing home. In one scene, Libaitque takes us through and almost historic but apocalyptic journey through the house, during the shocking and jaw dropping climax.Mother!'s ending result leaves you rather traumatised and overwhelmed by the astounding cinematic creation you have just witnessed. In an amazing display, Aronofsky has fabricating and elusive dream like vision layered in many and different narratives to be interpreted in multiple ways depending on its viewers. From a poetic expression of the collapse of a happy marriage to a comment on torment of mother nature, to also biblical depictions.Mother! is masterfully constructed piece in whatever way you look at it. From surface level this work, is a very controversial and staggeringly difficult watch but as construction of narrative and cinema is phenomenal.",10,3,8,26 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Man of Steal x10, dramatic, longer, and with Batman.
","The moment has finally arrived, the day every nerd who asked their child friends, 'who would win in a fight between Batman and Superman' The first teaser caused us goosebumps, the first trailer made us excited, the next trailer made us sigh, but the next glimpses restored our faith. slightly.The huge debate over the nerd web, is whether Batman V Superman is good. I can say it is really good to an extent. So, can we trust an alien form another planet to protect us, a rich disturbed billionaire doesn't think so, and will do what he can to stop him.Firstly, the film is very good to an extent, but it's not perfect. What's great is the experience. Its mind blowingly stylised, with good cinematography (at moments) great score, and not too bad CGI. But the main issues are the narrative. Like others it does have a lot going on and there are things that can be taken out. I think there is a lot of context missing for some characters, but also parts of the story that are going on, and you sometimes just question what is happening but have to accept it. I could not really tell what directions some of the characters were going like Lex Luther.Another problem was the structure. It starts off pulling you in and you're hooked but then it declines and loses its momentum, and then pulls it out of the bag in the final act. It is far too long for the basic story, but it does build up the tension. I can agree that Ben Affleck was a great choice of casting for Batman, in my opinion Bale be better, but was great for this film. Henry Cavil reprises his role as the much darker version of Superman, but still with good will. Jessie Eisenberg plays the very crazy Lex Luther. I don't think he was bad but he was more Joker like than a subtle obsessed villain. Overall, as Man of Steal was quite big and explosive, and Batman V Superman is more of this, but also much more loud, very dramatic, and has a very dark atmosphere. This makes me doubt the film's enjoyment for younger viewers. But I think in the future of the DC films, there is much more of this come.So the first acts of the film are not so exciting and powerful, but the film really does explode an atomic bomb of cool and insane awesome in the last act. Dawn of Justice is an 8/10 but it is not perfect.",5,3,6,25 March 2016
The Deer Hunter," Traumatic Brilliance
","Michael Cimino's 1978 Oscar winning drama, a traumatic and moving Mellon collie tale.Based on the screenplay The Man Who Came to Play by Louis Garfinkle The Deer Hunter is memorable story about friends and how their American community becomes victimised by the terrorising Vietnam war. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep, star as the friends keeping up a happy loving family of friends that still hold up friendship even when the bad luck haunts them. Winning best director, Editing, Sound, supporting actor for Walken and Best Picture, the Deer Hunter lives righteous as a classic and portrays a striking reality during the time and wonderful blend of performances.A group of steel worker friends living in Clairton Pennsylvania, (De Niro, Walken, John Savage, and John Cazale) share fun loving banter together as they prepare for one of theirs weddings, go hunting, and as they go across the world to serve their country. When three of the good chumps eventually make it to the Vietnam war, they enter a world that they may not all return from and try to find themselves again back home.All cast displaying awe inspiring characters, De Niro doing what he does best, Meryl Streep also portraying a very lovely performance. But as the Academy did rightly justice to Christopher Walken's outstanding performance gives the film the heart that is at its focus, especially delivering the real pounding emotion in the third act of the film.Set during one of the most important times in world history, the Dear Hunter truly express's impact that tormented America and it's people at the time. A very solid piece of perfect story telling and directing creating magnificence in heart-breaking traumatising format.The Deer Hunter is a very powerful piece of cinema and propaganda even, discovering more about impact of the Vietnam war, and very correct win of Best Picture at the Oscars.

Deadpool," Bloody, rude, vulgar, stupid, SOOOOOO Awesome!
","The anticipated Deadpool has arrived, with fans either expecting it to be really great, or awful, but it turns out brilliant.Putting X Men origins under the rug, Ryan Reynolds returns as Wade Wilson the repulsive, vial, antihero for his local town, but when diagnosed with cancer, he is given the chance to become a superhero, but obviously he takes this opportunity to do what he wants and mess about with a blend of his humour with his decapitating people skills.I can firmly say that Ryan Reynolds was born for this role and does actually kill the part in the film. We've seen him in some funny films, and some okay action movies, but what he needed was a mix of the two to create the perfect film for him. (Not implying anything as him as a person just his acting talent) Here we see all the key personalities of Deadpool, the violence, the sexually motivated, the constant humour, and cool action. Of course the whole point of Deadpool is being really silly, talking to the audience, referencing the film franchise itself, it could be seen as stupid, but no its so Awesome.I have never found the small humour in the other super hero films very entertaining, but five minutes into Deadpool, I was already close to hysterics.The only thing that bugged me is the constant sexual references, which is part of Deadpool's character, but maybe there was too many for me.Deadpool is a clear 9/10 and much more entertaining and just so awesome than first thought, and will not be a disappointment to Deadpool fans.",8,3,13,12 February 2016

","A mind blowing spy action with a hint of British class that makes you proud to be British. Kingsman provides action, intensity, comedy, and fun for all viewers. If you think it is a simple spoof of all spy films, you could not be more wrong.Colin Firth provides that awesome, and fetching fighting skills, and character for viewers to support. Seen in continuous fight scenes, with sensational Cinematography, we meet the James Bond side of Firth with non-stop skills. Kingsman is definitely a 10/10, and must see film of 2015. Although the film contains constant bloody and graphic content throughout, I believe that Kingsman is film for the whole age appropriate family.This film is strongly recommended by this viewer so, grab your ticket and enjoy 2 hours of action packed thrills.",8,3,10,13 June 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," The Man, the Myth, the legend , and the suave.
","Chad Stahelski brings back the slickest and most dangerous hit-man alive, John Wick in a whole new thrilling and air punching adventure to bring another perfect cinematic action experience.Following the events of the first film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) after tying up final loose ends, attempts to retire his highly skilled assassin life, but his past indeed catches up again as he is pulled back into the game when an old acquaintance tries to entice Wick into a debt. However as he is forced back into his dark life, things take more of a turn for the worst as he faces a darker world hit men, vengeance, and sharp suits.What could be described as slick cool fashion show of suits, guns and cars is actually more then meets the eye. John Wick (2014) was a hidden gem of a film, that really entered a league of its own in the action genre. What the sequel delivers is really more of what its fans love cranked up to 11. Still fuelled with the wonderfully choreographed violence which I like to describe as beautiful. This also again is shot so professionally Dan Laustsen that makes the action so fluent in one shot with really no cuts.What is the base line in the John Wick universe is the hotel of assassins 'Continental' a very interesting and exciting concept that definitely pulls you in from the first film, and again is a real pleasure to enjoy with Ian McShane being the lead manager of the establishment, and later Lawrence Fishburne chewing up as much scenery as he can gets his hands on. At again Reeves doing more acting with his boy over his voice, which I guess is the heart of Wick's character.Although the world that John Wick lives is a clearly ridicules world of mad violence looking cool while shooting people in the head, this is what makes the films enjoyable. Chapter 2 really does go a bit more mad though, but it doesn't weaken the films purpose. Of course what should be taken from this experience is the enjoyment. I wouldn't call the first Joh Wick a exploitation 'throw away' movie, John Wick was real new fun and exciting action experience. But Chapter 2 may push us into this characteristic more but does not steal the spirit that the first film gave us.It should be understood that viewers who haven't seen the first one may not take hold of what John Wick Chapter 2 offers. People who are fans of the first film will probably enjoy the sequel, but may not be everyone's cup of tea.Chapter 2 does fail to not quite live up to its predecessor, but still lives up to the fun. Still facing issues with the story and ridiculous suave action Know what your in for John Wick Chapter 2 and don't take very seriously but take it for what it is, because then you can just really enjoy the nonsensical violence of the John Wick world. So if you want to punch the air in fun excitement, which is not provided for you by Fifty Shades Darker, then experience another telling of the impossible legendary hit-man John Wick. 7.8/10",8,2,6,18 February 2017
Annihilation," This would have wiped me out if it was in the cinema
","Although I have finally caught up with Alex Garland's latest science fiction thriller, I am still irritated I didn't get the pleasure to witness it in the cinema, but I hope Netflix has offered the best of the experience.Garland's previous film Ex Machina (2015) displayed an intelligent and deep presentation of science fiction, which is what you should also expect for Annihilation. Based on the novel Jeff VanderMeer, Garland creates a visual sensation of suspense and mystery, unfortunately robbed the chance to be shown on the big screen in the UK., however its distribution on Netflix does hopefully make a film more people to reach.Natalie Portman plays Lena, and ex army solider, biologist, who Special Forces' husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) unexpectedly returns after being presumed killed in action. After Kane becomes ill, Lena is taken to Area X, a secret base which is monitoring a mysterious anomaly called the 'Shimmer'. which Kane has returned from. Now Lena and group of female scientists Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Josie (Tessa Thompson), (Cassie Tuva Novotny) led by Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) begin an expedition into the 'Shimmer' to reach the source of the anomaly, the lighthouse.At the center of the film is Natalie Portman, a charismatic scientist a solider who's journey deeper into the 'Shimmer' draws us deeper into her mind. Carrying a determined personal mission to understand what has happened to her husband, Lena is a looking glass into the mysteries that the Shimmer contains. Opposite her is Jennifer Jason Leigh a puzzle herself with her own unknown reasons for the mission but whose screen presence is somehow misused.But what illuminates and grips us into this journey is the stunning visuals splashing blends of colour and shapes, beautiful but also sinister. Inside the 'Shimmer' we find unimaginable sights nature and life evolving in a extraordinary but disturbing fashion when the team encounter various creatures and plants.Carried through this excursion is also the unsettling growls and wails of Ben Sailsbury and Geoff Barrow's score. Sailsbury and Barrow's sound for my mind took me back to the loud drowning noises of Los Angeles from Blade Runner 2049 (2017) with the atmosphere of Arrival (2016). I wonder whether Denise Villenurce and Alex Garland get along in their common approaches to the science fiction genre. Annihilation does splendidly entertain in this manner as well as being a thought provoking concentration of ideas. The film journey to reach this may seem ambiguous to some and also confusing but fundamentally works in a stable form.With Netflix's rise to power increasing, its a positive to see that they are getting their hands on strong material but still steals the chance to see something that is born to be a cinematic experience, which I feel would have left a stronger impact.",8,0,2,9 June 2018
Spectre," ....Unbeliveable!
","Finally a Bond film that feels like a Bond film.Don't get me wrong the past three films have been magnificent, but now at SPECTRE we truly see Daniel Craig's 007 in the full flesh. Casino Royal was excellent, Quantum of Solace was good, Skyfall was brilliant, Spectre is.UNBELIEVABLE!!!We find Bond tracking down people associated with a mysterious organisation that will lead him on a mission like none ever before. With Daniel Craig returning as the fabulous British agent he portrays perfectly, with company of the MI6 but also Christopher Waltz as the best bond villain ever seen before.SPECTRE ticks all box's and is a James Bond film that will never be forgotten. Fuelled with brilliant exhilarating action sequences, suspense, and just moments where cannot stop but smile as you enjoy absolute marvellous work. Although this viewer is still debating whether it's the best Bond movie ever, but it will be very close.Even though this film is sensational, there are a few nags that the film could have developed. Personally I would describe the only problem is being too over the top is some elements. Of course in a franchise such as James Bond we will find the narrative over the top. But here it may just a little too much. For most of the film I found Craig's performance to be slightly wooden than his past efforts.I think this is a pure Bond film that Daniel Craig is now officially suited in and is all 23 films all wrapped in one. SPECTRE is a solid 9/10 and the must see currently in cinemas.",7,13,33,28 October 2015
The Nice Guys," Niccccccccceeee!
","Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe star in the neo noir comedy The Nice Guys, which follows the investigation of two independent investigators working together to uncover a case within the 1970s Los Angles porn industry. I have never seen to actors work so well in a a buddy action like this before, and they are just so cool to watch together. Directed by Shane Black the Nice Guys provides a solid good time at the cinema for viewers with entertaining action, intriguing narrative, and enjoyable humour.So as said before, both Gosling and Crowe are absolutely great together with there different personalities that just work and you can even imagine them being a real team. Especially Crowe is really cool and bad ass which would make you honoured to know him. Gosling pulls of a great typical 70s figure with the support of great costumes although his character is an moron but he accepts that.At the heart of it is also Gosling's daughter (in the film) who provides more significance than first thought in a non annoying way, and does not try to bring a moral loving side to the narrative.Although the narrative does grab the audience, there is no real direction where you think its going, and it's not always clear what is going on the whole time.Then there is also the comedy which is entertaining and will tickle audiences but may not make you laugh out loud. I'm not really the best judge of comedy, so I can't really say how funny it is, but it is enjoyable.So in the end, The Nice Guys is very enjoyable and fun to watch, but may not be for everyone. It is more unique then other buddy action comedies like Rush Hour, 2 Guns, or The Others Guys. 7.5/10",7,3,7,9 June 2016
Macbeth," First of all, this is not a film, it's an experience
","One of Shakespeare's classic tales has been brought to a whole new level, as we enter the real dark world of Macbeth and the pain, guilt, and bloodshed forged from this mind blowing masterpiece. A soon as the film begins we are in the middle of a battle. We're not watching it, we're in it. The heart pounding sounds of the soldiers, the marvellous editing, makes the audience feel in the battle as you hear the fighting commence.Michel Fassbender gives a breath taking performance with power, and passion, along with an excellent cast behind him. With such passion in their tone, we instantly listen to the poetic dialogue especially from the voices of Fassbender, Harris, and Debicki. The music within the film is so powerful and moving it creates the exact atmosphere that we are thinking, and creates the dark and tragic themes of the story. There are also moments that are so beautiful, such as the battle scenes which you just admire.Although we do not see the manipulative Lady Macbeth as in the original story, and we have Macbeth as a much stronger and fearful character that has no weakness, at all. All been said, this is still a brilliant adaptation.This is an absolute must see, even if you have to drive to another town to see it. This is a 9/10 and strongly recommended to all Shakespeare lovers.",9,3,10,24 October 2015
The Martian," Definitely very good, I'm not sure Im on the same page.
","Sadly I don't think the film has clicked in me yet, when the initial reaction would be 'WOW', but my reaction was 'okay' Now I am defiantly sure that The Martian was a terrific film, but I am not with it yet. I'm not saying it's a bad at all, but I have a few thoughts that may make more my level.Firstly the film, tells the survival story of an astronaut stranded on Mars after his teammates believe he is dead and leave. Our solitary space man must then calculate how much time and food he has left, before he can be saved, leading him to grow potatoes on Mars's soil. Now this narrative absolutely had me, however I feel differently after viewing this.The film is packed with great cinematography and special effects that gave you're a great idea of what the red planet may hold. I can promise that there are moments that will leave you breathless. Matt Damon portrays his character brilliantly (Not Oscar worthy but good), and great screenplay, with new dialogue not seen in many sci fi's. The film also is packed with comedic moments that give the film an entertaining vibe.Although I will say that there are elements that I would change, but I fear I would make many fans angry. However, I recommend this to all major film fans, so you can decide what this film is. I give it an 8/10 but think the film could be more intense, exciting and enjoyable.",8,5,65,3 October 2015
