The Blair Witch Project," refreshingly spookie
","Well, what an imaginative way to use semi-limited resources. This film was refreshing in its originality, an example being the camera shots, as well as the fact that the players are also filming it. That offered a more terrifying perspective. Since this film is fairly unseen, to date, I will not reveal plot, etc.. it's also nice to see that the directors appear to be down to earth people. I don't think this film would be as lively had it been any other way. Bravo.",9,1,2,27 June 1999
