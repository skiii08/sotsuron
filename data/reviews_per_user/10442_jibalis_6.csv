Sucker Punch," That's why movies need stories.
","When I saw first twenty minutes of this movie, I thought it will be very good movie. I mean, the beginning was nearly perfect. But then...The plot itself was way too simple.five girls have to get five things. And that's all. Nearly whole movie it was all plot. But the thing that screwed this movie mostly where these random action sequences. They were just plain stupid, unnecessary. At the beginning I was really surprised. I was like, what is this 'Mortal Kombat' or something? These random action scenes took about 50% of the movie. These scenes just didn't fit in movie. I wanted to see how the story (no matter how simple it is) progresses, not some 'cool' women killing of Nazi zombies. And when producers wanted to make them look more epic adding up some random special effects, it just made whole movie lamer and worse. I wanted to see a movie with a good and interesting plot, I saw a lame action flick... 5/10",4,0,2,3 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," So... Unfamiliar?
","This movie was one of two movies which for me was worth seeing in cinema this year (other one is 'Skyfall'). Spider-man is by far my favorite superhero, so I had high expectations for this movie... But they didn't paid off as I hoped... Firstly everyone claimed this movie to be much closer to the comic books than Raimi's Spider-man. So it made me even more excited about this. But truth was different. Peter went to school with skateboard,he wore contacts at the beginning of movie and most importantly - aunt May had brown hair. That's just wrong. And Peter didn't worked for Daily Bugle as freelance photographer. And they even changed origins of Peter getting his powers. So Suddenly mid through movie I realized it's actually hard for me to believe I'm actually watching Spider-man. Plot also seemed pretty simple and unattractive. From the trailer it seemed that Spider-man in this movie will be humorous and funny like in comics. But the only funny spidey scene was that one shown in trailer with car thief. And I also didn't like that in the end (major spoilers here) Lizard was caught and put in jail. I thought that Lizard was in the first movie, so Spider-man can cure him and leave Connors secret identity as lizard in secret and then in later movies Connors could help him like in comics. Because in comics Connors was actually the good guy and couldn't control himself as Lizard. Now for things what I liked. Emma's Stone's was amazing as Gwen Stacy. She really was perfect for this role. Andrew's Garfield's performance was pretty well too. Stan Lee's cameo was the best I've ever seen. And there were some good scenes like Peter fighting some random dudes in the metro and I actually really enjoyed how thug, who killed Ben, stole cash from shop and passed Peter his milk. It was really cool. So in conclusion... Somehow this movie didn't seemed too good for me. Maybe it's just because I have really related to Raimi's trilogy and I just love Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. Maybe with time I'll suit to Garfield as Peter Parker and'll be able to watch Webb's work in another light...",8,1,2,4 August 2012
Kick-Ass," Most screwed-up drama ever...
","I had quite high expectations for this movie. I thought this will be one of those hilarious half-parody movies. But my expectations were crashed to the ground. And here is why.This movie actually had very little of comedy elements. VERY. I am not even sure if this movie can be counted as a comedy. Through the whole movie I laughed only one time.Actually first part of the movie seemed quite depressing to me. Firstly because as I said there was very little of comedy elements and secondly because the new 'superhero' failed very hard. I mean he got stabbed, then he got ran over by a car (I suppose this was one of comedy scenes, but... Come on, what are you twelve?), and got taken to a hospital. I am a fan of superheros, have read comics and watched movies of them and his failure seemed quite depressing to me.Can't say second part of the movie was much better. It weren't depressing anymore. It was just screwed up. All this stuff with Red Mist dude, big daddy and his daughter. And because of lack of humor it weren't very funny. So after all, what is this movie? Most screwed up drama ever or freakiest action movie of the century?",5,1,5,8 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Has to be the worst movie I have ever seen
","When it comes to this, it seems that there really isn't much of substance to this movie. Various things happen, a lot of commotion on the screen, but where do they ultimately lead? What is the bigger picture? Truth is that there isn't even a bigger picture. What we see, is all that is and it is nothing particularly exciting even if they try to mask the hollowness behind a bunch of explosions, shootings and other stuff. To be honest, I see no difference between this Star Wars movie or any average Michael Bay movie. Plot wise it's about as deep as Transformers. We have got Harisson Fordie back and Carrie Fisher and that weird blonde dude. Carrie used to be smoking in the 80's. I mean, she does look a bit like a farmer from 19th century, but in that slave outfit, even if the movie was bland as hell, I could still enjoy the sight of her cleavage. But now she's 60 and that sight isn't particularly attractive to me anymore. And Ford? He used to be such a man in the 80's. But now he's just an old man, who looks like he should be at a retirement home watching TV with other old people. And the blonde dude is just as annoying as he was. He ain't a Jedi. Just a farm boy. This movie really lacks in every department imaginable. How you suppose for me to enjoy a piece like this when there's nothing beyond the sparkling facade? Where's the emotion? Where's the depth? In my opinion Star Wars has to be one of the worst franchises imaginable and I will never associate myself with any person that belongs to it's fan base.",7,62,84,27 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," 'Come on Tom, let's finish this the way we started, together.'
","This movie was very special for me. Nine years ago I saw first Harry Potter movie. I loved it and in few next months read all books available at the moment. It was the first book franchise, I read and tough, it was never my favorite, it always had a very special place in my mind. And now nine years later, after I've read all the books and seen all previous movies, it was time to finish this. Movie started very good. It started just, where the first part ended. Soundtrack, that played in the beginning, was awesome and from the very beginning gave an epic feel to movie.Storyline was not made by this movie's makers, but by Rowling, so I can't really judge it. I can judge only the way it was told. And that seemed very good to me. Nothing seemed forced or rushed, or going too slow. Movie was moving at a very good pace. Special effects were also good. Loved Daniel's, Rupert's and Emma's performance. Evanna Lynch (Luna) and Mathew Lewis (Neville) did an outstanding job in this movie. I thought they should've given Evanna more screen time, but I had the same thought after watching every movie she was in...It's been a real while, since I read Deathly Hallows, and I read it only once, so I didn't remember much and couldn't judge any inaccuracies. Though, even if I could, I wouldn't, because, I think, movie doesn't have to go just the same way as books.I really loved part, where Snape died and showed Harry his memories. For me, It was the best and most touching part in the whole movie. Battle for Hogwart's was also pretty good, tough I think they could've shown us more from it. Now about things I didn't like. Nothing much to tell really. Special effects in scene, where Voldemort and Harry were jumping/flying (not sure) of the tower, seemed pretty lame. And that's pretty much all. If we wan't to be really picky, then I thought Molly's Weasly's expression after killing Bellatrix was quite strange. And no Fred's, Remus's and Tonks's death scene. So, in the end I loved this movie and enjoyed it very much. I give it 10/10, mostly because it's the last movie and it was very satisfying.",10,4,6,3 January 2013
Fast Five," Getting whole crew together - awesome idea
","I had quite high expectations about this movie. And they paid of even more that I thought.I thought that getting all awesome guys from previous movies was great idea. Like Han from 'Tokyo Drift' alone made this movie much, much better for me just with his appearance. I also very enjoyed Roman's appearance as I really liked him in '2 Fast 2 Furious' (much peoples say it's lame, but I think it was a great entertainment)and he was pretty cool in here too, tough a lil bit too negative. I didn't really remember Gisele and these two Dominicans Tego and Rico. But I guess, they were from 'Fast & Furious'. I have seen it only once, so I don't really remember any second plan characters. These guys however were great too. I loved these two Dominicans arguing. Now finally about the movie. Well I loved it from first minutes till last seconds. It was full of tense action. Much more than in previous parts. What I didn't like was, that there were no street races in this one. I guess that bit where Han, Dom, Brian and Rom were racing betting 1 million each, can't actually be counted. I also didn't like Vince's appearance. I disliked him at first movie and don't think he was necessary at this one. Dwayne's Johnson's appearance was great too, because I very like some of his movies (Scorpion king, Welcome to the jungle). The plot. I liked it. It weren't too advanced and some people might call it unrealistic and lame, but, come on, it's an action movie! In summary I can say, this movie was one of greatest F&F franchise movies, if not the greatest. I hope to see whole gang together also for the next, because mostly that made this movie so awesome. 9/10",10,5,7,29 April 2012
