Walk the Line," As good as it gets.
","The performances in this film are fabulous. Starting with Robert Patrick, who breathes the despair and disdain inherent with a hard drinking cotton picker of the 1930's into the character of Ray Cash. Elvis, Jerry Lee, and Waylon are afforded an interesting take by Messrs Hilton, Payne, and Jennings respectively. No one in this film is imitating, all are acting, and it really comes off clean. Reese Witherspoon is nothing short of amazing as June Carter. Her singing, insight into character, and precision of nuance is spot on. You will be enthralled by her performance every time you watch it. Joaquin Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash right before your eyes. From the slightly higher tone of his vocals at the beginning, to the rich robust baritone that a hard life injected into his voice as he matured, Mr. Phoenix is perfect in his interpretation of this music legend. Tieing these great performances all together is James Mangold, who never forgets that this is above all else a love story, and treats it with the respect that it deserves. Mr. Mangold uses the great music and strong characters to build upon the deep felt romance that lies throughout this excellent motion picture. Country music fan or not...this is one of the great bio pics.",9,2,5,30 November 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," 30's-Captain Blood,40's The Sea Hawk,50's Crimson Pirate, 00' Pirates of the Caribbean.
","More than any other actor of his generation, Johnny Depp has fascinated me the most. Save for the choices of Brad Pitt, Depp's depth in the roles he has chosen clearly puts him at the head of his class. His portrayal of Jack Sparrow, in this Disney winner, is a composite performance that cannot be compared to any I have ever witnessed. Rush, Bloom, and Knightley are excellent in their respective skins, but Depp's Sparrow is the reason to Fly to see this movie. Like his predecessors, Messrs. Flynn and Lancaster, each scene is an ode to what a real Swashbuckling Movie Star should be. Haven't had this much fun at a Movie in a long time. And the proof of this pudding is in the spontaneous applause you will see and hear at the end of the story(p.s. stay through the end credits). Lord, last time I experienced THAT, was easily 40 years ago. GO take yourself and anyone you know who enjoys escapist entertainment and dive into Pirates of the Caribbean.",10,0,1,14 July 2003
Batman Begins," Excellent depiction of the 'Dark Knight'
","Really did not know what to expect when I went to see this adaptation. Needless to say, I was blown away. I have been a big fan of Christian Bale after I saw Empire of the Sun in 1987. His portrayal of Bruce Wayne is phenomenal. Chris Nolan and David Goyer have scripted and brought to the screen the definitive comic book movie. This Batman is based in reality as far as that goes. His allies and villain's are believable in the context of the story's source material. The entire cast plays their assigned roles 'straight', and each one is a truly memorable performance. All elements of Wayne's transition to Batman are told with depth and believability. Wally Pfister's cinematography is crisp and telling. Lee Smith's editing is a little jagged at times, but nevertheless, effective. The music is effective yet not intrusive. All in all, this is by far the finest 'Comic' movie ever brought to the screen and then some. It is a wonderful movie, Period. Don't miss Batman Begins!",9,0,0,21 June 2005
The Dark Knight," Comic Strip Psycho-Brilliance!
","Christopher Nolan/David Goyer's 'Batman Begins' was excellent, but obviously fell short of being the true harbinger for the future brilliance that was to comeÂ… The Dark Knight. As already mentioned, all performances are superb (special kudos to Ledger), but story and cinematography, as woven by the Nolan brother's is nothing short of breathtaking. 'The Dark Knight' is one of the deepest journey's into the macabre ever filmed. Not only are we drawn to our 'protagonist', but we find ourselves eerily sharing a common thread with both the Joker, and Two Face, a woven path that has us as an audience, in a conundrumof horror and laughter. Needless to say, no easy feat for any motionpicture, let alone one whose characters have been known for 70 years! I am sure to a person, each of us came out of the theater thoroughly entertained, yet thoroughly bothered by not only what we had seen, but just as definitively what we had felt. This movie is as unique an experience you will find in Cinema, one that happens all to infrequently. That is why 'The Dark Knight' ranks as great film.",9,2,6,24 July 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Lag Eat Storm
","Interesting position I find myself in trying to honestly review this movie, really enjoyed it, but came away empty, looking to be fulfilled so much more.Thought the casting was fine, cept, for the life of me,I have a hard time with Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. Viggo, Hugh, Russell, even Paul Bettany, (as brilliantly as he portrayed Silas), I would have envisioned more impactive as Langdon, than Hanks.Major problem was the constant breaks in the action to revert to flashbacks for the sake of historical significance. Really the only way to accomplish this on film, but it did have a tendency to slow down, and murk up the feeling of suspense. Also, the chemistry was a stretch between Hanks and Tautou. Still, all of the pieces still fit all together, making an enjoyable movie viewing experience, whether you have read the book or not.Thought the soundtrack was haunting and beautiful, and Howard's cinematic eye was right on target as far as the filming was concerned.Never really a fair comparison, book to movie, but I expected sooo much more. Have fun deciphering the summary line.",7,1,2,5 June 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Starsky & Holmes
","One of the previews that preceded this movie was a trailer for 'Hot Tub Time Machine', how apropos I thought after viewing this rendition of Sherlock Holmes. It appears Guy Ritchie has brought 21st Century hip actors (Downy, Law, McAdams et al) and transported them back to Victorian era London. A fun ride yes! However as someone who has been enamored with the Great Detective from childhood, this depiction pays more homage to Madonna, than it does Doyle. Cinematography and sets are wonderful, the feeling of that London of long ago is expertly captured here. Sad that the characters and dialog could not have been set in that time as well. Bottom line, if you want to see Ironman stalk Moriarty, this is your flick. If you want to remain true to the Cannon and immerse yourself in England of the latter part of the 19th Century, I suggest you purchase or rent any of the Granada TV produced Sherlock Holmes videos, with Jeremy Brett and David Burke.",5,9,29,26 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Absolutely Fabulous
","Peter Jackson's epic comes to an end with the character building of Citizen Kane, the action sequences of Spartacus, the special effects of Star Wars, and  a masterful musical score, this truly is one of the best movies ever made.",10,0,1,5 January 2004
The Matrix," Ingenious, Special Effects, Martial Arts, Sci-Fi
","The Blade Runner of the New Millennium. The Wachowski Brothers have crafted an ingenious story line, and added some 'kick a**' special effects intertwined with world class martial arts action. The result, is a dynamic sci-fi joy ride, which ultimately reminds us of the blessing of life, and what it means to be Free. Maybe not as ground breaking as Ridley Scott's 1982 Blade Runner but close. Certainly a Keeper.",9,0,0,29 February 2000
Sin City," One Wild Ride
","All others who have afforded commentary, will no doubt mention all that is fabulously original with this wild roller coaster ride of a movie. Suffice to say, the cast is brilliant, cinematography beyond belief, true to the subject material directly on point. A new millennium look at the great 40's & 50's Mickey Spillane type plots, with modern 'rip em' up' thrown in for the present time & culture. Mickey Rourke is 'all over' his portrayal of 'Marv', & all the women are beautiful and seductive. Clive Owen's Dwight is as complicated and interesting a character as has been witnessed in a while. Absolutely loved Elijah Woods Kevin. Benicio Del Toro never disappoints, and neither does anyone else in this epic original film. The matchbook cover said it all...BOOZE & BROADS!",8,0,1,28 April 2005
