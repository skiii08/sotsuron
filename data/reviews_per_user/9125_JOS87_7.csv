The Devil's Advocate," Freaky!
","The movie was indeed freaky but it was good in a twisted way. Al Pachino, was great (if you ask me), he definetly did a wonderful job portraying the devil. Keano Reeves was as usual- ok, but he was pretty good too. Charlize Theron was actually very good in my taste. The plot itself was very good yet twisted, the near ending where Keano... well I won't say, but when there is all the fire was very good and the freakiest scene of the movie. Though the real ending (the last scene) kinda confused me, though it was good. All in all this is a movie worth watching, but keep in mind that it's twisted, weird and pretty dark. 7 out of 10.",Null,1,1,30 November 1999
Antz," Allen, Stone, Stalone, Lopez= Great Film
","What a Great movie, truly enjoyable both to parents and children. While A Bug's Life is more childish Antz can also capture teen and adult audiences. Woody Aleen as usual is so funny and just to see him as a little ant made me laugh. The casting in this movie was just GREAT with huge stars such as Woody Allen (as Z) Sharon Stone (as Princess Balla) and other great voices such as Sylvester Stalone, Jennifer Lopez, Gene Hackman and TONS more. In the plot Z (Allen) falls in love with Balla (Stone) and finds out she's the princess trying to get her to notice him once again (after a dance, very like the one in Pulp Fiction) accidentely goes to war and becomes a hero, kidnaps the princess and I won't say the rest. This is a VERY funny movie indeed. Once again Allen has that charm. Go see it no matter how old you are :-)And in the end there is a nice little surprise.",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," PHANTASTIC
","This movie is just GREAT! I've never been a Star Wars fan but thanks to this movie I now am. This is my all time favorite movie. George Lucas sure knows how to write great scripts. This was better then the first 3 movies because the effects were way better thanks to the HI-TEC of today, I also liked the characters more. Who could believe little Anakin would be Darth-Vader?
Natalie Portman did a GREAT job as the Queen and Jake Lloyd as Anakin the same. I never really liked Liam Neeson but he was great in this movie. Ewan McGregor also did a good job. This movie is *****out of*****GO see it in the cinema now, the effects won't be the same on video/DVD. :-)",10,0,0,15 August 1999
Se7en," SPOOKY and GROSS
","This was shown one Monday here so I thought I'd check it out. It had a really good cast Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow. But it got way too spooky for me (it was about midnight) So I turned it off after the bed scene (The guy that was tied to a bed for 364 days) That was so gross. I'm gonna rent it and see it at day this time. See it only if you can stand gross but really gross things. If Scream made you sick DO NOT see this film.",Null,0,2,15 August 1999
Titanic," One of the best movies ever!
","This is more like two movies in one. It's divided to two parts: -The love story -The ship sinking At first we see what seems to be a documentry about the Titanic, but isn't. Then we see how OLD Rose (Gloria Stewert) tells her story in which at first we see Jack (DiCaprio) and Rose (Winslet) meet, have a love story, parents disagree kinda like Romeo & Juliet (which is also a DiCaprio film). Then we have a break and then the ship crashes into the iceberg which mostly shows how people try to survive and then in the end... well I won't say the end. If you take away the effects you have one of the greatest love stories of all times (with low budget effects) and if you take away the love story you have one of the greatest adventure films. Basicly the film won 11 Oscars and became tho most grossing movie in Box-Office history. It'a good movie. If you haven't seen it (Where were you the past 2 years?) go see it, it won't hurt you (ot James Cameron). OK I was foucusing too much on comedy on this review- sorry. Anyway to make a long review short: -rent the movie, if you don't like it turn it off -I'd recommend it (a long with a Billion other people)- ok less",Null,1,2,16 August 1999
Scream 2," Good, But not as the first
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS READ ONLY IF YOU SAW THE MOVIEAnyway now that that's out. Here's the review. OK first scene very scary. Jada Pinkett (now Smith)'s death was very spooky indeed. Then Randy's death, not only scary but funny (the guys with the stereo) I LOVED Cici's (Sarah Michelle Gellar, aka Buffy) death totaly spooky. Then the part with Duey and Gale in the projecting room gave thrills as well. It was a prettt good movie, more laughs, less thrills. I was very disapointed with the ending though, the killers were such minor characters we new nothing about so we didn't really care and the last scene in Scream defunetly beat this scene. Also the first scene beat Scream 2's first scene (That's probably one of the scariest scene's I've ever seen up til today). DON'T see it if you didn't see the first, you won't understand it, it brings up a lot of things mentioned in the first (doesn't really continue the story but continue's the minor stories of scream, the personal lives, not the murders) So if you haven't seen the first you won't get this film. If you have seen this film go see it, it won't exactly be a masterpiece but a vey nice way to spend a Friday night. (Especially if it's the 13'th) :-)7 Outta 10. See it, it's not bad",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
Scream," It's A Scream!
","GREAT MOVIE,One of the best I've ever seen. Kevin Williamson is one of todays best screen-writters. The cast was perfect. Neve Campbell was great and Jamie Kennedy like wise. I loved the first scene it was soooo scary, I watched it on tape and in the first 5 minutes of the film I went and locked the doors and every few seconds looked behind me. This movie is one of the scariest I've seen. I became A HUGE Kevin Williamson film (especially after I found out he also made Dawson's Creek- which I LOVE and IKWYDLS, also GREAT). I can't wait for Scream 3 and Kevin's new tv show.5 outta 5 Must see",Null,0,1,15 August 1999
