Despicable Me 2," Just as fun as the first one!
","Despicable Me 2 is just as fun and as hilarious as the first film. With great voice performances and a wonderful story to boot.Gru (Steve Carell) has now settled down as the father of three daughters (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher), trying to run a jam business. However, he soon finds himself back at work when a woman named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) recruits him to join the AVL, and track down a villain (Benjamin Bratt) who plans to rule the world with an experimental compound.The Minions are just as hilarious as they were the first time around. You'll be laughing at everything they do in this film, and I mean EVERYTHING! The only thing that disappointed me was how Margo and her new boyfriend was dealt with. I was hoping for something more out of it.But in the end, Despicable Me 2 is still a great fun ride for all ages, and will provide endless laughs for all to enjoy.",8,0,2,23 June 2013
Frost_Nixon," A very interesting look at political history
","Very rarely do I see a drama film, because I'm more into comedy films like Robin Hood: Men in Tights and Airplane, but this film really surprised me.It's kinda like one of my favourite Australian films, The Night We Called It a Day, in that we have America and another country clashing with each other. In the case of Frost/Nixon, it's America and Britain as David Frost prepares to interview former US president Richard Nixon, in what would be history in the making.Frank and Michael are really great in their roles, and this film is very deserving of its Oscars it's nominated for. It features great camera work and wonderful dialogue from Peter Morgan, the writer of The Queen and the stage play that this film is based on.I recommend this film to anyone who's interested in political history, or who wants to see Richard Nixon's final defeat from David Frost via the interviews done in a really great way (the film is directed by Ron Howard).Oh, and by the way (and this is my Australian self saying this!), I love how they got to mention David Frost's time in Australia!",9,1,2,21 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The Best Movie of the Summer (even though it was winter in Australia)
","I only have one thing to say about this film... BRILLIANT (with a capital B)! Although there were some brilliant moments in the film, it was Johnny Depp who was a standout for me. His witty moments (especially when he says 'Oh, bugger' when confronted by the tribe) were wonderful. There are some moments here that were nasty (not gross/gory nasty), so the little kiddies may want to avoid this one. (It is rated M in Australia, PG-13 for America) But, it was a brilliant film. If you don't get to see it on the big screen, get the DVD when it comes out. You will not be disappointed! P.S. Did anyone love the new Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning? I did. I can't wait to see it again on DVD!",10,28,37,1 August 2006
Argo," A sure-fire contender for Best Picture
","I've had the great pleasure of seeing this movie before the rest of Australia, and it was such a great film. A mix of thriller, drama and satire, Argo is a sure-fire contender for Best Picture at the Oscars.Taking place during the Iran Hostage Crisis, Ben Affleck plays a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist who finds out that 6 Americans from the US Embassy have escaped and are now sheltering at the home of the Canadian Ambassador. After watching TV, he comes up with an improbable plan: make a Canadian fake movie and disguise the 6 Americans as members of the Canadian film crew doing location scouting.The film has lots of tension and some hilarious moments as well. Fantastic acting from the cast and great direction, and the last 30 minutes will have you fearing for their lives. It's one of the best films of the year, and my pick for Best Picture at the next Oscars.",9,2,5,15 October 2012
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not for the offended kind!
","Before I review this movie, answer this question: Are you offended in anyway by swearing, including the f word? If you've answered no, then keep reading. This is one of the funniest movies ever made.While the film does contain quite possibly every swear word you can think of, it's still a great film, with hilarious musical numbers and brilliant moments.One thing I love about this movie is Marc Shaiman's score. I love how it's composed not like a comedy, which is what this film is. Some of the best moments are because of the music. Of course, there's the hilarious musical numbers that will stay in your head for some time! If you're not offended by swearing (including the number of times the f word is used), then this is the comedy movie to see.",9,2,2,8 September 2007
Hot Fuzz," Lots of fun!
","What can I say? It's a brilliant comedy that works on the same levels as Shaun of the Dead (even though I haven't seen it!) The story goes that Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote this film) is one of the best cops in the UK. But his colleagues are very jealous. So, they send Nick to the sleepy town of Sandford, where not much happens a lot. To make things worse, he's teamed up with a wannabe-cop named Danny (Nick Frost). But soon, a series of murders start to happen, and Nick is convinced that this town may not be so sleepy after all.This film works as a brilliant comedy and a mystery thriller. The thriller only adds to the humour of the film. Simon Pegg was great and brought a lot to the film.This is the best British comedy in years. Very recommended!",9,2,4,29 July 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A wonderfully made (if dark) musical!
","This is the second Tim Burton film I've seen (the first one being Corpse Bride), and I can see why people are starting to like his films.Tim Burton is a man who's not afraid to go dark in terms of look, performance and humour. This film, based on the popular musical, includes these things.Johnny Depp is wonderful as Sweeney Todd, who was sentenced to prison for 'foolishness'. He returns to find that Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) has taken over his previous home. She sells the worst pies in London. But, after finding his razors, he decides to use them to seek revenge on the judge (Alan Rickman) who imprisoned him.This is a great film, with great songs, wonderful performances and a funny performance by Sacha Baron Cohen (even though I hate Borat). I do hope that Johnny Depp wins the Oscar. He deserves it! ^_^",9,0,1,29 January 2008
Tangled," Hands down the funniest Disney movie ever made
","If you thought The Emperor's New Groove was the funniest Disney movie ever made, then wait till you see Tangled. It has brilliant comedy and very sweet moments.In this film, Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) has been keeping Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) in a tower due to Rapunzel's magic hair, that allows Mother Gothel to stay young. When Rapunzel is left alone, a man named Flynn (Zachary Levi) enters her life. They leave the tower to discover the world she never experienced.What's so great about this movie isn't just because of the music of the relationship between Rapunzel and Flynn, it's the comedy, and this has one of the best comedy characters ever made... Maximus the horse. I won't give away what he does, but you'll be laughing your butt off over his adventures as he searches for Flynn.It's a fantastic movie, a great ride for both young and old, and some of the best comedy I've ever seen.",9,5,6,25 January 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," An outstanding piece of work
","Edgar Wright is without a doubt one of the most creative directors working today. Having already done Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, he proves that he's still got the touch with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, an adaptation of the graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley. In this film, Scott (Michael Cera) has found the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But unfortunately for him, in order for Scott to date Ramona, he must defeat seven of her evil ex-boyfriends who want him dead.This film is a visual feast. Filled with awesome gags and video game music cues, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one outstanding piece of work, and that's saying something. The cast was awesome. Special props to Kieran Culkin who stole the scenes as Wallace Wells. He was hilarious. I never thought a film like this would make me smile, but it did, and I loved it. Highly recommended!",9,7,27,13 August 2010
Wreck-It Ralph," A fantastic film!!
","It's rare that a Walt Disney Animation Studios film is considered better than a Pixar film, but this is such an example. It's almost like Disney's answer to Scott Pilgrim in terms of how it uses video games, but a great story and cast prevents this from being a copy of said film.John C. Reilly voices Wreck-it Ralph, a villain of a 8-bit video game where he gets no respect for his role since the hero of the game, Fix-it Felix Jr (Jack McBrayer), gets all the glory. When a new First Person Shooter game named Hero's Duty arrives, Ralph sees this as an opportunity to prove himself as a hero, but in the process, he ends up causing a catastrophe that could mean game over for the arcade!While gamers will love the various audio and visual gags in this film, the story and characters (including Sarah Silverman as Vanellope von Schweetz) really shine. One of my favourite things about this film is the interactions between Felix and Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch). They were brilliant together. In the end, this is a highly entertaining movie and one I truly recommend to see, gamer or not!",9,1,1,14 January 2013
Ghostbusters," Now I know why it's entered the pop culture world
","It was no surprise as to why Ghostbusters has entered the pop culture world (and it's not just because of the theme song!). I've heard about it, I've read some of the quotes, heck I've listened to the theme song LONG before I heard about this film.But enough about beforehand. This is a funny film. Bill Murray really shines here. His dead-pan humour and smart-ass remarks are really great. The rest of the cast are great as well. Dan Aykroyd as the smarts of the group, Harold Ramis as the intelligent scientist, and Ernie Hudson as the smart-talking new recruit. But there are ghost in this film, and as unrealisitic as it is compared to today, they are still really good, and I can say that I've now got one quote from this film that has become one of my all-time favourites ('We came, we saw, we kicked its ASS!!').This is a funny film, and I can really see why it's entered the pop culture world. It's become one of the most memorable comedies thanks to it's effects, theme song and humour.",9,0,0,13 August 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Loads of fun!!
","I loved this film. I think its one of the funniest, most creative animated films I've ever seen. The jokes and colourful scenery were just brilliant. Bill Hader and Anna Faris were wonderful together, as was the supporting cast including Mr T who was brilliant as the over-protective cop! The best thing about this film was that it was never boring! When there wasn't any comedy, there was action scenes that were awesome. There were also some family moments, but they're really short. It's a great film with great comedy and action, and the 3D works great as well. I definitely recommend this animated classic. It's a hilarious film!",9,3,5,28 November 2009
Hotel Transylvania," A VERY hysterical animated movie!
","Don't let the casting of Adam Sandler put you off seeing this movie. It's one of the funniest animated movies you'll see this year.Directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of Dexter's Lab and Samurai Jack, the film tells of Dracula (Adam Sandler) who turns his castle into a 5-star hotel in order to protect her daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from humans. However, when a human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) enters the hotel, Dracula finds himself in big trouble when Jonathan falls for Dracula's daughter! There are some great lines and moments in this film that will have everyone laughing, and despite the inevitable 'eventually-everyone-finds-out-and-gets-isolated' scene, there's still a lot to love about this film. It's brilliant!",9,2,6,15 October 2012
Toy Story 2," My All-Time Favourite Movie
","What is it about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's funny, sad, wonderful and all around brilliant. The film follows Woody (Tom Hanks) being stolen by a greedy toy collector (Wayne Knight). What Woody doesn't know is that he's a valuable collector toy and that he was part of an old 1950s TV show. The rest of the gang must rescue Woody, but Woody finds himself in a difficult position: go back to Andy, knowing he'll outgrow him, or stay with Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) to be looked at for generations.This film includes in my opinion the best song ever written for film: When She Loved Me. A very sad and beautiful song that really gets to you. It's an ABSOLUTE CRIME that it didn't win the Oscar. Almost as bad as the Twilight Saga existing.Toy Story 2 is not only the best sequel ever made, it's also my all-time favourite movie.",10,1,3,1 November 2013
How to Train Your Dragon," A great film with humour and heart
","This is one of the best animated films of the year. It's great to see in 3D as well. With amazing visual sequences and funny humour, How to Train Your Dragon delivers them wonderfully.Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a boy who wants to be a viking, like his dad (Gerard 'THIS IS SPARTA!' Butler). But when he finally captures a dragon who he calls Toothless, he soon realizes that they might not be so bad as they think.This is a great film with wonderful visual sequences and great characters. Astrid in particular became my favourite by the end of the film. In conclusion, I recommend this film, especially in 3D. Wonderfully made.",9,4,12,25 March 2010
The Da Vinci Code," A wonderful thrill ride, even if you haven't read the book!
","This is definitely one of Ron Howard's great films. I approached it ignoring all the controversy that surrounded it (GET OVER IT!!), and left the theatre satisfied.Tom Hanks' performance was wonderful (he's one of my favourite actors), the twists and turns got me going and it really was a wonderful thrill ride, and that's saying something (coming from a comedy/slapstick fan). I should also mention Ian McKellen's performance. He was wonderful also.Bravo to Ron Howard for creating a great film for thrill seekers alike and a film that did stay true to the book (my brother loved it too).",8,1,4,3 December 2006
Sherlock Holmes," A fun, thrill-filled movie
","Director Guy Richie (Snatch) breaks the gangster mold to bring Sherlock Holmes to the screen, and he achieves it well. In this film, Robert Downey Jr (in one of his best roles) and Jude Law are Sherlock Holmes and Watson. They learn of a man named Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has risen from the dead, and is willing to destroy all of England. With the assistance of Irene Alder (Rachel McAdams), Sherlock and Watson go on an adventure to stop Blackwood from achieving his goal.Robert and Jude are brilliant. Their chemistry together provides some great comedy and the action sequences are really well done. Most of the film I was really surprised at just how brilliant Sherlock really was: noticing the tiny details, re-telling a person's life, I was really amazed by it.The only complaint I have (and this is a MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!!!) is what happened to Irene Alder at the end. That's all I'm going to say.Despite this, Sherlock Holmes is a film that entertains, and provides great comedy to keep the laughs coming! 9/10",9,0,4,31 December 2009
Despicable Me," Funny and sweet
","Despicable Me is an animated movie that delights in its sweetness and humour.Gru (Steve Carell) is a super villain who meets his rival Vector (Jason Segal) when he steals a shrink ray. Determined to get it back so that he can pull off the true crime, Gru meets three orphaned girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher) selling cookies to Vector. Suddenly, Gru has an idea: use the three girls as pawns so that he can retrieve the shrink ray. But soon, he discovers that the girls see something in him that no one has ever seen in him: a dad.Throughout the movie, we see some great humour from the girls' innocent curiosity and the minions' outrageous antics. The film does get sweet as it goes along, and this isn't a bad thing. When it does get sweet and cute, it pays off, as Gru becomes more attached to the girls, especially during the climax.Overall, while it's not as brilliant as Toy Story 3, Despicable Me is still a great animated film to take the kids to. It's funny, cute and sweet.",9,0,1,25 September 2010
Toy Story 3," The best film of the year
","This is, without a doubt, the best film of the year. Don't get me wrong, How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent film as well. But Pixar have managed to become the animated equivalent of The Lord of the Rings: a trilogy in which all three films are awesome in their own right.In this film, Andy is going to college, and Woody's (Tom Hanks) not happy. But through a series of mistakes, the gang end up at a daycare center, where they meet Lotso (Ned Beatty), a cuddly teddy bear. But they soon realise that it wasn't what they thought it was going to be.The film has incredible callbacks to previous films, hilarious moments, and one very touching ending. Pixar have continued to provide epic film after epic film, but this will be their very best, along side the second Toy Story.",10,4,5,24 June 2010
Sin City," Cool!
","That's all I can say about this film... cool, with a capital 'C'. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller really worked together to bring this film to life. Even if you haven't read the graphic novels that this film is based on, you'll still be amazed by the style of it.The film consists of three stories and one short: The Customer is Always Right, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill (my favourite) and That Yellow Bastard. Each story has a brilliant cast and a great storyline. My favourite performance is Elijah Wood as Kevin, because he really brought out the 'silent killer'-type profile into it.This is one of my favourite films, and it will be yours too. Highly recommended!",9,1,2,3 January 2007
The Simpsons Movie," It's been said before and I'll say it again...
","It was worth the wait! This is truly the best animated film of the year! There were so many great moments (like Green Day playing violins as they sink), and the cast just did a brilliant job on the movie.In this movie, Homer accidentally pollutes the lake with pig waste and, as a result, the EPA seal the town with a giant dome. Now, the Simpsons family declared fugitives, they must save the town after they learn that the powerful leader of the EPA (voiced by Albert Brooks) wants to destroy the town! Besides a great plot, there were some brilliant moments (Spider-Pig being one of them) that you just can't help but laugh! This is the animated film to see!! You will not be disappointed!!",10,5,11,4 August 2007
