Hereditary," Worst movie I've ever seen.
","This movie is way too far stretched. I get the concept of going with one of the kings of hell as the main reason behind the ongoings, however major portions of the movie were just too out there. One being the mothers lifeless body floating into the treehouse. Wth. Anyway this movie stands as my least favorite movie ever.",1,1,3,2 April 2020
