Angels & Demons," Not one for Dan Brown Fans!
","When will the movie industry learn its lesson? This is the 2nd of Dan Browns novels to have been completely destroyed. I don't think it's possible to take a book like Angels and Demons, and cram it in a 2 hour movie, without sacrificing major parts of the plot - as this movie has clearly demonstrated. I found it quite saddening, to see such a fantastic, imaginative, thought provoking novel by an amazing author, turned into a fast-paced, flawed, blockbuster action movie. I found Tom Hanks portrayal of Robert Langdon quite laughable and the actress playing Vittoria appeared in desperate need of acting lessons (you would think this would be a pre-requisite).However, all this said - I would imagine the film would have been slightly less agonising had I not been spoilt by Dan Browns novel. My boyfriend watched the movie with me, having never read a book in his life and found the movie enjoyable. In conclusion - if you haven't read the book - you may like it (or not completely hate it), if you have read the book and don't want your illusions shattered, AVOID!!!",2,5,15,21 May 2009
