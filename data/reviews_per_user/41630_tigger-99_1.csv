Lucky Number Slevin," Involved multi-character mystery
","Reading some of these comments, I really do wonder if some of these people have actually seen the film, or perhaps have been concentrating.The film contains a deliberate confusion of characters, perhaps convoluted, but then this is about entertainment. The plot unfolds in a sequence of hints, leading to the ultimate unfold in its closing moments, whereupon it all makes sense... or at least I thought it did until I read some of the comments on here.If you are reading these comments before seeing the film, I would suggest you stop as you will find the confused misinformation many have written will spoil your enjoyment of a clever involved film.",Null,0,3,26 June 2006
