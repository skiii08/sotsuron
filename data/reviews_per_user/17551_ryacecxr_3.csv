Blade Runner 2049," Makes No Sense
","The film's setting is supposed to be a dystopian post nuclear war future where the rich and able leave the planet while leaving the poor and lower classes behind.So what do we see in this hellhole that supposedly everyone wants to leave? Cool tech, jobs, replicants coming to it and working in it, pretty holographic slim babes who flaunt and cook for you, prostitutes approaching you for a good time and they are eye candy et cetra.You tell me what is wrong with this picture.",3,37,58,19 January 2020
A Clockwork Orange," Violence Is Art
","And the droogies do it in style!The settings, cinematography and stylized violence are superlative. the attention to detail is such that this film earns a place of its own far above everything else.He has his own style, makes love and takes what he wants until the state brainwashes him and robs his mind. Then he turns to Jesus.",9,31,38,19 January 2020
