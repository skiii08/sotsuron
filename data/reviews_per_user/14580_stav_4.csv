Ali," Slightly entertaining, but not 'the greatest'.
","It's not really the fact that I was expecting more from this film, or simply because Michael Mann was going to be in the directors seat for this one, but this movie does in fact fall slightly short of the mark. The directing unfortunately is not that great (especially from a movie that is supposedly an Oscar candidate), where at times, one felt the camera was being shaken too much and too often in order to create that 'authentic' feel. In addition, when looking at Will Smith one cannot stop remembering him being a naughty kid nephew, fighting aliens, or driving fast cars - which obviously does not help with the authenticity of creating Muhammed Ali.One could say that the good points come from the fight scenes, and at times Smith does vaguely resemble Ali (in looks and voice) where some of those famous quotes will bring a smile to everyone's face. Unfortunately it's not enough, and what could have been a classic, is turned average, not because little effort had been put into the movie, but simply because it's too difficult to re-create something that genuinely is such a classic.Rating: 3/5",6,0,0,3 March 2002
The Big Lebowski," This movie is hilarious!
","I remember watching this movie for the first time and found it to be pretty good. The second time I watched it I was in fits of laughter. By the third time I was hysterical! This movie has so many in-jokes and funny scenes you simply will not catch them all in one sitting.The story itself as a crime movie is absolutely brilliant. Never have I seen so many characters involved in one plot so well, and all because of a rug! (well, partially). Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi give a magnificent performance, and their friendship on screen as a group of guys doing nothing but bowl and drink beer is one to admire. 'The Dude' is probably one of the coolest characters ever created, but to be fair, everyones character has been remarkably developed.This movie is hilarious and if you are looking for something 'chilled' and funny then this is it dude!Rating  -5 out of 5-",10,0,1,8 December 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Modern Disney with a big pinch of Hilarity.
","Its sad to think that the new wave of animation attracting the movie-going public has been coming from animators that prefer to use the computer generated modelling for their films (Shrek, Monsters Inc. etc..)  These films are by no means bad, but personally, the more 'old-fashioned' style of animation created on the drawing boards seems to hit a sweeter chord than those that have been brought about using 3D models and backrounds (though Finding Nemo and Toy Story are brilliant too, I must admit). Perhaps its the feeling that these films are more reminiscent to the way things were before the digital age, or perhaps its the fact that the drawings for the 2D movies give it that extra 'cartoony' feel without the concept of realism and hence, can simply be enjoyed to the max as a .... cartoon.What The Emperor's New Groove does so well where possibly others have failed is that it does not take itself seriously, not because it lacks realism, but due to the actual script and storyboard itself. There aren't many drama moments that try to make the audience weep and when it does happen, the makers have opted to add a quick punch line or a quick extra animation short that makes you laugh out once again. Some may argue that this gives the movie less substance but this in fact is a refreshing change to the tried and tested formula of the happy-to-sad-then-happy-again rollercoaster many other animation films have become famous for.I for one am extremely pleased with this Disney release and however you want to look at it, The Emperor's New Groove is a great success and should be viewed by everyone simply for the - very many - comedic moments it has to offer. Brilliant.Rating: 5/5",Null,0,1,11 July 2004
Blade Runner," Greatest Science-fiction/Drama movie ever made.
","This film is definitely the greatest Science-fiction/Drama movie ever made. Ridley Scott has managed to create a movie (in conjunction with the story) that depicts the future of the world and technology in an outstanding manner whereby an environment of solitude and closure is created amongst an influx of over-population and overwhelming advertising and entrepreneurial/urban development.The feeling of darkness and bleak desolation is beautifully conveyed as a result of the wonderful directing, and the musical undertones create the ultimate balance between surrealism and fiction.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer both give great performances, but the movie in itself works so well that no matter who played those roles, this movie would have been a success anyway.In my opinion, this is really what movies are all about. It gives a fantastic account of what the director is trying to show us through the storyline while leaving the viewer mesmerized and captivated by what he/she has seen, and at the same time questioning the future and its implications.This is an exceptionally original movie and one that will remain a classic for millions of other movies to come. Brilliant stuff.Rating  -5 out of 5-",10,3,4,8 December 2001
