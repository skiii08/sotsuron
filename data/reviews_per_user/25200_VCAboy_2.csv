United 93," One of the most heartbreaking tales ever put to screen
","(Stunned silence) That's how I left the theater. It had been too long since the attacks for me to remember them very well. I can't say it was nice at all to have a reminder, but it was necessary. 9/11 is a date that should never be forgotten by any American, and this film will help keep that day alive in people's minds. What this film will also do is tell a story that not many people know.As humans we have a tendency to dwell on the negative. This amazing film contains the tale of one of the greatest examples of heroism that I can think of. The passengers banded together once they knew something was wrong. It wasn't just wasn't passenger that was the hero; it was all of them. They saved what was most likely the capitol from being hit, and thus saved the entire country. The terrorists, no matter how the film portrays them, we're pure, unadulterated evil. It lifts my spirits to know that there are still people left in the world who can recognize it and actually do something about it.My screening of the film was quite the strange one. There was a family in the theater with two boys, eight-ish and four-ish. Personally, I think those parents were utter morons for taking children that young to see this movie. Granted, it's one not to be missed, but should be seen only by those old enough to handle the events and remember them. The second thing that happened to make me think of what a buffoon the mother was was here question to the kids: 'Well, did you like it?' This is not a movie to be enjoyed; it is one to be experienced. I did not leave the theater feeling uplifted or overjoyed like I might at a summer popcorn movie. I was numb, but in a good necessary way.I can't stress it enough: see this movie. You will leave the theater numb and stunned. I believe that a film like this was needed to commemorate the passengers of United 93 and to forever immortalize their sacrifice. What a job the filmmakers did. Paul Greengrass and his crew crafted an experience that I will never forget.",10,0,2,7 May 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Sets the standard for action movies, and it still hasn't been beaten!
","This is, simply, the best action movie I've ever seen. I just cannot get enough of it! Everything about the movie is flawless, the direction, the visual effects(which are still stunning, mind you), the action, the pacing. Just utterly flawless.James Cameron proved with this movie, not 'Titanic', that he truly was the King of the World. He has created an action masterpiece. T2 set the bar for action movies for years to come, and that bar, in my humble opinion, has not been raised yet.In T2, Ah-nuld returns as Cyberdyne Systems Model T-101, only this time his mission is to protect. He is not supposed to protect Sarah Connor, but her teenage son, John Connor, who was conceived during Sarah's night of passion with Kyle Reese in the original. Of course, you can't have a good Terminator movie without a decent bad guy, and this bad guy is more than decent. He's the Cyberdyne Systems Model T-1000. He's a polymimetic alloy, liquid metal to the lay person, more than a match for Ah-nuld.Robert Patrick creates one of the absolute most menacing movie villains ever put to film. What makes him scarier than Arnold in the original is that he looks like an ordinary guy. He's clearly not a bodybuilder, yet his icy stare is utterly chilling. Arnold returns in fine form, though, proving that he can play a convincing good guy. He also throws in bits of comic relief, too, though it's mainly on the Director's Cut, aka the Extreme Edition DVD. Pick that one up; it's got a hilarious scene where John teaches the T-101 to smile.Linda Hamilton is perfect as Sarah Connor. She's buffed up since the last one, making for one heck of a butt-kicker. She also convincingly portrays an affectionate mom who, though she may sound insane, only wants to do what's best for her son.The biggest standout, though, is Edward Furlong, who plays John Connor. He's the perfect guy to portray the spunk and resourcefulness's that John has. It's all the more spectacular in knowing that this is Furlong's film debut. Sadly, he wasn't able to return for T-3 because of his continuing drug problem.I cannot do this movie justice! I've seen it many, many times, and I keep coming back for more. Everyone on the message boards agrees with me that it's one of the top 10 action movies of all time. Oh, I would want to caution parents before letting your kids see it. It's very violent, though not as graphic as it could have been. It's got some language, too, although compared to most of today's R-rated movies, it's fairly tame. See this movie now! You will not be sorry! Hasta la vista, baby.",10,5,6,18 April 2005
