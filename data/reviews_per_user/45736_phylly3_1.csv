Catch Me If You Can," Best movie in ages
","I give this movie top rating! It's a MUST SEE. If you didn't know that it was a true story you might think it was too far-fetched. That's what makes it so intriguing. Very good acting from Leonardo and Tom Hanks. My only complaint would be that the mother's character was a bit difficult for me to figure out. The look of the film is also just right. It stayed in my mind for days after and led me to do a bit of research on the real-life character. Apparently the movie stayed very close to the autobiography except for the father's character. His role was enlarged for the movie, perhaps to help explain Leonardo's character's motivations. Don't miss this one!",9,1,2,7 September 2003
