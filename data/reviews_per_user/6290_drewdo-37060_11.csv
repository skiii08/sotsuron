Hereditary," The Next Insidious!
",There were a lot of twists but it was somewhat confusing at times. This was an amazing movie otherwise and I was not expecting Charlie to die!!!! So sudden! Great movie. 100% recommend.,10,14,31,9 June 2018
Deadpool 2," Best movie of 2018
","When I saw this film, I had high hopes that it would be good and it was! The only problems that I had with this film are that it gets a little bit slow at times but then it almost imeaditly bounces back and gets great! Some things that I love about this movie are that it is VERY meta and self-aware and the writers are excelent.",8,6,14,28 May 2018
BlacKkKlansman," No way this does not win best picture
",This film was the best film that I saw in 2018. The ending especially with the live news footage. There is no way this movie goes to the Oscars and does not win the award for best picture!,9,3,8,19 February 2019
The Thing," I love it!
","This is easily one of my favorite movies. The building dread throughout and the acting are all great. The way ever character is written and the uncertainty played throughout is great. The practical effects are amazing and this movie is just all around amazing. I don't fully know what else to say about it, it's just an amazing movie with so much ambiguity. I could watch it again and again. Even through the slow parts of the movie, it picks back up shortly after so it's not that noticeable. Even though this is a remake of The Thing From Another World (1951) it's great and not really a remake at the same time. I love this movie.",10,3,5,17 July 2019
Face_Off," Well then...
","Okay. This movie didn't need Nick Cage to be kept on a leash for once. John Travolta on the other hand did. He was crazy in this as the... i don't know how to explain it, but it's good. The whole premise of the movie, while illogical, is good and the effects are good. The script has some good jokes and some fairly serious moments. For not being an action movie fan, this is surprisingly good, even if it is confusing at times. You really feel it for Archer too at times. Troy really makes you mad.",8,0,0,1 August 2019
Yesterday," Love it!
",This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's funny as all h*ll and is consistent with solid acting. I'm not one for drama or romance in movies but I'll be damned if this movie didn't do it well. It was so good and you really felt for Jack and even for Ellie sometimes. The humor again is something I have to touch on again because it was really subtle at times and was never right in your face. The characters were cute and there were some fun and fairly unexpected 'twists' near the end. This was great.,10,0,2,13 July 2019
Toy Story 4," Pixar, You've Done It Again!
","Pixar, you have done it again. Toy Story 4 is an instant classic and in my humble opinion is better than the original. I saw it the day before opening day in a sold out theater of people of all ages. Many of them dressed up too! There is so much humor throughout and a good story. Tony Hale as Forky is so fun and all of the characters are played and acted well. Fun animation and characters. Duke Kaboom played by Keanu Reeves, Bunny played by Jorden Peele and Ducky played by Keegan Michael-Keys were all so funny. Annie Potts returned as Bo Peep and the whole movie was just so fun. The trailer didn't give anything away and was all around such a good movie and an amazing note to end a franchise on. I loved this movie.",10,3,10,22 June 2019
The Lion King," Pretty good
","While I've never seen the original, this was a good movie. Some thing I didn't like were that the words didn't always match up with the characters mouths. Another thing I didn't like were the amount of useless scenes in the movie. I know that those were present in the original as well but they can still be cut out. The animals looked great and they actually 'filmed' in Africa. There was also a fairly subtle Beauty and the Beast reference from Timon and Pumbaa that I liked and all throughout Zazu, Timon, Pumbaa, Kamari, and Azizi were our comic relief and they were good at it. This was a good movie undoubtedly and I don't really know what else to say about it.",7,1,9,19 July 2019
Paranormal Activity," ok
",Found footage is generally all the same with this being slightly different. It's still not great the acting is the only true good thing other than the scares. Micha is a jerk to Kate and is just a douche other than a few moments. That's really all I have to say about this. There's nothing really that good.,6,0,1,17 July 2019
Midsommar," What?
","I don't know what this movie is. I don't know what to think about this movie. It's not that... I don't know. After you get by the GRATUITOUS, FULL FRONTAL nudity (of both men and women) and GRATUITOUS sex scene it's a good movie. Confusing, but good. It has a lot of cool transitions and while I didn't know what was going on most of the time I had things to think about like the warping background and the overall art film aspect. It's hard to separate Hereditary from Midsommar but when you get by the similarity's and consider this a completely different movie, which it is, it's good. I liked it and while it is 2 hours and 27 minutes it's never boring. There's always something to think about.",8,6,17,3 July 2019
Halloween," YES
","This is a classic for many reasons. From the amazing and iconic score to Jamie Lee Curtis in her first film to Michael Myers being amazing it's just great. Sure, it has its flaws like any other movie, including a slow second act, but once Michael starts to attach Laurie, we have iconic scenes, amazing filmmaking, payoff of shots of the houses and THAT AMAZING SCORE! The way Michael is so stalkerish and super human is great and just damn I love this movie.",8,0,0,3 August 2019
