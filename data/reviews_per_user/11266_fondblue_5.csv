The Blair Witch Project," Pathetic hype, with no real acting or script
","Of course the 'clever' part of the film is that its lack of a script or acting is its selling point.  I don't buy it.  Personally, I have seen few worse films... make that no worse films.  The only talent in this film was in the marketing... I mean even in the current era of such Oscar-winning duds as BraveHeart and Titanic this looks bad.",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
Underground," Well made, but disturbingly hateful toward women
","It is a sad commentary on our current culture that nearly everyone seems to blindly accept or ignore that this film is fundamentally hateful toward women.  Yes, once again Cannes has fallen in love with a film where every women is a whore (at best)...  Why can't the male imagination find room for an intelligent female character, or a female character with any agency... or really even a female character at all... The allusion to Chaplin seems particularly sad to me... yes, the film has slapstick, but I found it disturbingly bereft of the more subtle humor, empathy and inner warmth, which underlies Chaplin's truly great films...",Null,6,16,8 September 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Less a Film Than a Flattering, But Pallid Simulation
","With all of Hollywood at his disposal Spielberg has no excuse for his own mediocrity as a film maker.  This 'simulation' fails for the same reason that it is possible.  Viewers leave the theaters believing that they understand war, what it was like to be there, and that they have seen a 'realistic' portrait of war.  Saving Private Ryan makes war comfortable and knowable even in its supposed gritty action.  If anything, Spielberg's method suggests a realistic portrayal of what it was like to fantasize about the war while remaining on the homefront... thus in his footage of the landing scene, Spielberg consciously imitates newsreel footage which was viewed back home rather than as it was seen on the beaches.  It is a style of film making which believes that the truth is in the details, but the end result is a lifeless mannequin with no soul or inner truth.  Saving Private Ryan is much like the photographic snapshot, which however more 'realistic' never conveys the deeper meaning and realism of a painting.  Although perhaps a deserving pat on the back for a generation which faced something truly awful, in the end I believe Speilberg has done veterans a disservice by flattering millions into believing they understand what it was like to be there (or how else could so many non-veterans talk of the 'realism'?",3,1,2,4 May 2000
The Thin Red Line," More Than Speilberg's Pallid Simulation of War
","Although some prefer the big budget simulations offered by Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line offers a much more subtle and thoughtful, if not always successful, alternative.  As a historian, I would suggest that 'simulations' of War or Holocaust will always fall flat, because they cannot hope to match the shear enormity of the experience. Saving Private Ryan encourages us to identify with the characters and their situations, and in the end fools us into believing that we actually understand what it was like at D-Day, while in fact simply reinforcing familiar myths and preconceived notions of war.  In essence I would argue that Saving Private Ryan fails for the very reason we think it is good, because it fools us into believing that it is 'realistic' and thus we are now drawn to it as initiates in the sacred knowledge of war.  The Thin Red Line is not a grand simulation, a heroic tale, or yet another ode to the 'Greatest Generation.'  Rather, it is a poetic piece suggesting the irreconcilable differences between life/humanity and war.  On the surface it is rather a conventional and familiar narrative--capture the hill against impossible odds-- but the actual underlying story is one of escape.  In fact many different very personal escapes from military situations which ask men and women to sacrifice their morals, their consciences, their lives, their careers, their singular happiness.  This film is not always successful... the Notlte role, while a crowd-pleaser-is a bit broad--and the screen play is at times uneven, but it is a rare case of a truly ensemble cast, devoid of the usual overblown characters, bad accents etc.  In particular, the actor playing Witt is superb.  The broader public will always prefer the easy flattery of Saving Private Ryan, which makes everyone feel in control and knowledgable.... I would rather suggest a more difficult, but more fruitful path.  If the the Thin Red Line still falls short, it is already miles ahead of the pallid simulations",8,0,0,4 May 2000
Braveheart," I am cynical, but even I was shocked at how pathetic it was
",Come on!!!??? A top film and oscar?  Bad Script Bad acting Bad... I am mean this film was laughable... perhaps on par with a lower range Saturday afternoon film... maybe a George Hamilton film.  In competition with Dances with Wolves for the all time worst Oscar Winner.,4,4,7,20 November 1999
