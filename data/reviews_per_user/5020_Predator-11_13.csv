Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I would like to apologize
","I would just like to apoligize to those of you who read my first review of this movie. I was under the influence of a Star Wars high, that rampant lie was the result. I have seen Episode1 since then and be rest assured, I've changed my vote from a 9 to a 2. I guess it was just me going, LOOK! Pretty special effects!!!. I've now come to realize that cool sfx alone certainly don't make a real Star Wars movie. The origional trilogy had so much more than just SFX, which is why they're still great today when the effects are dated.That poor fool Lucas is trying to hold his entire movie up on special effects. He doesn't understand that great effects are only great when they're used to support the plot, not the other way around. Some examples of well used effects are The Matrix, Dark City, Fight Club, Gladiator, the older Terminator 2 and many others. Those came to mind because they used so many effects. Episode1 overdoes it, they put the effects everywhere and sacrafice everything else for that. Shame on George Lucas for trying to palm that off as a Star Wars movie.At least I ripped on Jar-Jar though. Later I realized that it's quite a big disturbance when that clumsy freak is a main charactor. The only way George Lucas can redeem himself is if he sucks that freak out of an airlock in the first 30 seconds of episode2. The oppening text should start to scroll and a ship flys by and jarjar flies out, choking to death.I probably will see episode2, but after all the hype is done with. I'll be sure to sneak in so I don't feel ripped off again. If the movie still sucks in 30 minutes, I'm leaving.",2,0,1,11 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Exciting and very enjoyable with some small flaws.
","Ok, first off I must admit I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and have been since I saw A New Hope. However I also have a hobby of giving movie reviews, so just before the movie started I forced myself to consider this just a normal movie until I'd seen it. With all the mixed reviews that have been thrown around in the last couple of weeks I got pretty nervous that Phanton Mennace would suck. Fortunately it definitely did not. Lets start with the best part of the movie and I hate to repeat what everyone else has already said but I will, the special effects. Visually this movie is nothing less than spectacular, the underwater scene was stunning, the lightsaber battle at the end was the best one yet, the pod race was one of the coolest things I have ever seen in my life (even people who hated the movie liked that part), the creatures were seamless, and the ships were overwhelming. Lucas and ILM didn't leave out any details no matter how small, the shadows, the light coming from different angles, the chrome on shiny ships, take a look it's all there. Everyone always cuts down on the acting but I didn't think it was bad at all, Neeson was really good as usual, McGreggor was playing a very different role than he's used to but he still did a good job, Portman was great, she was one of the big highlights of the film, Lloyd wasn't as bad as people made him out to be, I mean come on people, the kid's only eight how good do you expect him to be? The plot seemed a little bit weird considering the whole thing was about trade taxation, doesn't really seem like a star wars plot does it? But I'm pretty confident that everything will get straightened out in the next two films. My biggest complaint about the movie was a floppy eared alien named Jar Jar Binks, this character was just flat out stupid, I really think he should have been left out of the picture entirely, I couldn't believe that Lucas would throw in a character that bad just for a few laughs from his 6 year old audience. Another smaller flaw in the movie was the incredible luck all the characters had, when they're underwater a big fish attacks them and a bigger fish eats it, then they get attacked again and the same fish eats the second one. Also there's a part where Jar Jar Binks gets his foot attached to the wires of a downed attack droid and when he tries to shake it off the blaster in the dead droid's hands goes off three times killing three more droids, I wish that one of those shots had hit Jar Jar right in his stupid looking face, god I hate that guy. All in all it was definitely a very entertaining movie with all the charm of the original three and with cool new special effects to boot. On a scale of 1 to 10 if Jar Jar binks hadn't been in it I would have given it a 10 but because of that clumsy freak I give it a 9.",2,0,1,19 May 1999
X-Men," Fun and exciting but it has it's problems.
","To be completely truthful I though this movie was going to be lousy, I mean really lousy. I saw the preview and thought 'oh boy, another cheesy comic to film adaptation.' I had no intentions on seeing it but decided to give it a shot because I loved the comics (and had already seen everything else). I'm happy to say that I was very pleasently surprised. X-Men really stays true to the comics with well developed characters that act like they did in the comics. The casting was good in that aspect but I though everyone, except Xavior and Magneto looked too young. In the comics Storm is supposed to be a very old woman but she was cast with Halle Berry who is in her early 30s. But this is only a small let down.The effects are wonderful, big, exciting and flashy. If you can I would definatly recommend seeing this film in a THX certified theater as it really adds to the sound quality.The plot is good, making it feel like a long comic. Very satisfying.My biggest complaint was the absence of my favorite of all the X-Men. Gambit!!! Who's idea was it to leave him out? That guy really kicked some serious ass. Also I though it was too compact, they should have extended it into a 2+ hour movie.All in all it was a very nice change from all the poorly made comic to film adaptations. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,25 July 2000
Scary Movie 2," How did James Woods end up in this mess?
","That was the only question I was asking myself after watching Scary Movie 2. This movie is bad, VERY BAD. It rarely has jokes that are funny and the shock value is overdone and comes off as desperate. James Woods is the only good actor in the movie and he's also bad in it, he does have the only really funny line in the movie though. He walks into the room with The Exorcist girl, she spins her head around and he takes one look and says 'F**k this!' And walks out, I actually laughed at that part. The rest of the humor is just horribly crude and rarely funny. The movie is just one big spoof on many different movies done very poorly. Both of these traits can be very good if done correctly, crude humor is funny in the hands of the Farrelly brothers. Spoofs are funny in the hands of David Zucker. But unfortunatly neither is funny in the hands of the Wayans brothers.I can't recommend this movie to anyone except for the most immensely immature and perverted. On a scale of 1-10 I give Scary Movie 2 a 3.",3,4,8,5 July 2001
American History X," A powerful and brutally honest film about racism in the United States.
","American History X is by far one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. It stuck with me for days after the first time I watched it. The story is fairly simple. A highly respected Neo-Nazi named Darek gets out of prison and attempts to mend the damages done to his family by his hate-filled life. It's told through a mix of Darek's younger brother recalling the events leading to his arrest (in black and white) and current events just after his release (in color).Edward Norton gives a fantastic and moving performance as Darek. This is one of those movies where the actor get's so into the role that you completely forget you're watching a movie. In the flashback scenes he spouts extremely powerful dialog in a manner that will make you think he just thought of it on the spot. And in the present scenes he gives an emotionally moving performance as a loving brother. Norton was absolutly robbed of the best actor Oscar.The story is incredibly touching and honest, with scenes that will arise dozens of emotions in you. The manner in which the story unfolds is executed perfectly, cutting you off part way into the plot, but never leaving you confused or uptight. Each moment is just as interresting as the last. The ending leaves you with so much to think about that you'll want to see it again, just to make sure you took everything in.I recommend American History X to anyone who hasn't seen it, but I'll warn that the violence and intense, and sometimes angering subject matter might be too much for some. But since the film was obviously meant to be realistic, it succeeds in every aspect. I give American History X a perfect 10 stars out of 10.",10,0,0,25 October 2000
Pearl Harbor," Fun for the eyes, not for the brain.
","Well the first of many exciting summer blockbusters has arrived and it delivers on the special effects front, but not much elsewhere.Pearl Harbor is a story about two friends (can't remember their names in the movie and don't care enough to check) who like to fly planes. One of them gets a great girlfriend but decides to go off and fight the war, after his plane gets shot down everyone assumes he's dead and his friend decides to put the moves on his girlfriend. You can probably guess where the movie goes from here. Oh, I forgot to mention that they all wind up at Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941. The story is predictable and hokey but not quite as laughably cheesy as Titanic. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale all deliver better performances that Leonardo Dicaprio or Kate Winslet, but that's really not saying much.Anyway, enough about the stupid story. On to the battle scenes! The movie really delivers on this aspect with some of the biggest, most fantastic special effects I've seen to date. It's got huge explosions, wizzing bullets, crashing planes, fast paced dogfights, sinking ships, falling bombs and anything else you can think of. The Pearl Harbor attack scene is the highlight, of course, lasting about 40 minutes or so. However there are a couple other scenes that are quite impressive as well. Don't expect perfect historical accuracy though as this is something of a watered down version of the attack. One thing most veterans claim is the most memorable aspect of the attack is the oil spread all over the water igniting and burning sailors alive. There are no shots of this but there are a few inside the hospital of sailors covered in oil. This is a PG-13 Disney production though so expect the actual blood and gore to be at a minimum.My biggest problem with Pearl Harbor is the length. They essentially took a love story that could've been packed into less than an hour of footage and extended it over two hours. This can get quite annoying for the first 2/3rds of the film is extremely slow and uninteresting. If they had trimmed even half an hour off it would've made the film much more enjoyable. Oh well, I'll probably buy the DVD so I can skip straight to the good parts.So if you're looking for a big special effects extravaganza then Pearl Harbor will surely hit home, although you might consider walking in an hour late. If you're looking for a truly excellent movie with lots of depth, I would recommend you steer clear of Pearl Harbor and find a theater playing Memento instead. I'm going to do something I haven't done before which is give Pearl Harbor a couple different ratings. My final rating for the movie as a whole is a 5 out of 10. If they had chopped 20-30 minutes off the useless crap I would've given it a 6. 30-45 minutes would've gotten it a 7. And 45 minutes to an hour would've gotten it an 8. That's my opinion, enjoy.",5,0,0,26 May 2001
Saving Private Ryan," A powerful, moving film about a group of soldiers sent to save a mother's only surviving son caught in the middle of a brutal war.
","WOW! That's all I could say as I left the theater after seeing Saving Private Ryan, this movie is what film making is all about. As I walked out of the dark theater with my grandfather, who experienced the horror of Omaha Beach first hand over 50 years ago, I turned to him and said, 'Was it really like that?' What he told me was just about the best way to describe this movie you can get, he said 'Mathew, that movie was just about as close to war as you can get without the fear of taking a bullet.' I must say that Stephen Speilberg has outdone himself once again, not only was Saving Private Ryan the best war film ever made, I'm trying to decide if I think it's the best movie ever made. Of course the movie's highest points are the brilliantly realistic war scenes, especially the Omaha Beach scene but the visuals aren't it's only good parts. The story is quite well thought out and the reactions from the charecters are very realistic, ie. The soldiers aren't too happy about having to risk their lives for one private who no one has even heard of. The charecters are very well developed and you really get to know and love (or hate) each and every one of their personalities individually. Speilberg got his point across so well that by the end you're screaming 'KILL SOME NAZIS, THEN KILL MORE NAZIS, THEN AFTER THAT KILL EVEN MORE NAZIS.' Believable story, amazing visuals, top notch acting, superb directing, touching dialog. All in all a true masterpiece, see this film at all costs I recommend it to everyone.",10,0,1,22 March 1999
Driven," A real 'joy ride'
","I didn't really expect much walking into Driven. In fact only one thing was on my mind, watching some killer racing scenes with some bad ass crashes. I certainly got what I wanted, not much more though.The acting and story are fairly average. I'm not going to complain too much but it was certainly cheesy in many parts. Stallone does a decent job as an old, retired racer returning to help Kip Pardue get his sh*t together on the racetrack. I found him entertaining at best but his performance in this movie certainly doesn't compare to Rocky. Pardue's character is fairly bland and predictable, as is pretty much the entire plot. The rest of the cast fall in line the same way.Now on to the good stuff. THE RACING! There certainly is enough of it. There's probably at least one race every 15 minutes in the movie. That's a good thing though, especially after gone in sixty seconds which I didn't think had nearly enough racing. The races are fast and exciting and the crashes are breathtaking, if not 100% realistic. Many people complain about the CGI being too obvious but let's put it this way, whenever there's a shot where there's no way in hell they could get a camera there, it's CG. All in all I thought they did a good job on the CG, it's a perspective that you wouldn't be able to get under any other circumstance and it's definatly fun to look at, even if you know it's fake.One thing that bugged me was the constant jump cuts and jerky camera angles. During the races it's expected and didn't bother me but they even shot slow, talking scenes that way which can get pretty irritating. It's like that whole movie was just a big party in the editing room.My recommendation is to go see it with your friends and don't analyze it too much, otherwise you'll ruin the fun. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Driven a 7.",7,0,0,28 April 2001
Event Horizon," A rescue crew is sent to investigate a deep space exploration vessal that's been lost in space for seven years.
","OK, now, I've heard a lot of bad reviews of this movie and I'm not gonna say it's a great movie or anything like that. I just want to tell the truth about Event Horizon, personally I enjoyed it and I'm not just saying that because I like blood and gore, the plot made you think also. Sure it's filled with action and violence and blood and it's not a film for 10 year old kids but come to think of it all horror movies are the same way, go to the video store and try to find a good horror movie (or even a bad one) that isn't filled with the same stuff. Well now that we got the blood out of the way lets get down to buisness, the plot revolves around the theory that when you try to break the laws of physics you have to pay and that's exactly what happens to the Event Horizon and it's crew when it trys to travel faster than the speed of light. When you actually look into it the scientific idea behind Event Horizon is fairly sound, if we had the technology to create a black hole it might actually work. The horror part of Event Horizon is scary and it has suspence and good nail biting action, it's not oscar caliber and it's not five star but it is a good hour and a half of entertainment.",Null,0,0,22 March 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Not BAD, but not very good either.
","I was really hoping I would like this movie, but I didn't think I would. For one I'm a HUGE fan of John Woo films, and I really enjoyed Mission Impossible 1, but when I saw the preview it just didn't grab me and make me say 'I have GOT to see that movie'. But none the less I paid the $7 and checked it out.First of all this movie is NOT like M:I1, sure we've got Tom Cruise running around with a bunch of cool gadgets but the similarities end there. What we don't have is the intriguing and complicated plot of the first movie, in fact I thought the plot was fairly bland and uninteresting. We also don't have the shocking plot twists, yes there are attempts at plot twists but they're all way too predictable to be even the least bit shocking. It felt to me like Woo just tried to palm off all the twists with a bunch of mask scenes (you know the ones where you think it's one person but it turns out to be someone else), I thought the first one was good but I found it very easy to guess all the rest.However, most of the action scenes, although extremely unrealistic, were exciting and well done. You can really see John Woo come out in the action, particularly the last scene. There are tons of big, cool explosions, gunfights, stand offs, and slow motion effects. By far his flashiest, but not his best movie. A downside to M:I2 was that it had to be rated PG-13, most all of Woo's other films have R ratings which adds a level of brutality to them, and in that, realism. I found it took away from the movie to have such obviously far fetched scenes in it. I mean come on, you expect us to believe that two men can collide in mid air at a good 60 miles an hour, fall off a 20 foot ledge and then proceed to get in a ruthless fist fight? In reality they would be extremely lucky to be alive, and I mean EXTREMELY LUCKY!!! But who really cares, it's not like action movies are about realism, and by no means am I saying that Woo's other movies are realistic, but they were certainly more realistic than this one.So what did I think of this movie overall? Well, it's not bad. I didn't leave the theater feeling completely ripped off like with Battlefield Earth. However I also didn't leave the theater already wanting to see it again like with Gladiator. All in all it was a pretty average action flick, nothing really special like M:I1. If you're a big action movie buff I would say go ahead and see it, but if you want another M:I1 by all means steer clear of this movie because you will be horribly dissapointed. I give it a 6 stars out of 10.",4,0,0,25 May 2000
The Godfather: Part III," Not even close to the first two, but probably not as bad as you've heard.
","I recently picked up The Godfather DVD Collection, having seen (and loved) the first two films. I proceeded to watch the first two over again, enjoying every minute almost as much as the first time around. Then I watched the third one, which I had never seen before. I'd heard how bad it was, and how Coppola ruined the series with Part III, so my hopes were less than high, even though the brilliance of the first two films was still fresh in my mind. So I watched it all the way through, trying to keep an unbiased oppinion.Well, it's not great, that's for sure. But I wouldn't call it horrible either. It certainly lacks the wonderful mood and appeal of the first two films, and it doesn't hold together nearly as well. The first two are so masterful that it takes a very keen eye and many repeated viewings to find even the most minute flaws in them. In Part III, there's plenty of cheesy scenes, forced acting and hammy lines. On the other hand, a lot of the scenes were really good. I liked most of the time spent in Rome, especially the confession scene with Michael and the soon-to-be Pope. The construction of the story itself was pretty decent as well, although it's ruined a little bit by some bad acting. The main problem with the story of Part III was that it wasn't about anything the audience really cared about, and it certainly wasn't anything new. Part I gave us the story of an aging Mafia crime boss, who's family goes into chaos when he's shot. And Michael, the moral son who doesn't want to get involved with his families business, but feels it's his duty when he sees the corruption in the law and the government. Part II gave us the continuing story of Michael Corleone, trying to vanquish his enemies, and it also had the side story of Vito Corleone as a young man coming to America and his rise to power. To me the scenes with De Niro as Vito was the best part of Part II, and I don't think the film would've been nearly as great without them. Part III was the story of the aging Michael Corleone, but we'd already seen the same type of thing in Part I. So we start looking for parallels between Parts I and III, but they're just not there. So we start looking for originality and redeeming qualities of Part III on it's own, but we have a hard time looking past some of the flaws.Frankly I just didn't really give a damn about any of the characters in Part III. Michael was an old man, and I could guess he would be dead by the end of the film. Connie had suddenly turned into this hard Mafia consultant, which didn't seem to fit her character from the originals at all. Vincent was basically James Caan's character, Sonny, from the original, only Andy Garcia isn't as good an actor and didn't pull it off as believably. Also it seems hard to believe that Michael would leave the family in the hands of someone so brash and forward as Vincent. The character we were really supposed to care about, Mary, was completely blown by a terrible acting performance by Sofia Coppola, that has to be one of the worst casting calls I've ever seen. I literally laughed at the end (you all know what scene I'm talking about), her acting was just so canned and cheesy it was really pathetic.On an up note, the cinematography was great once again. Although the film didn't have the same play on light and shadowing that the first two had, it did have some amazing shots of Rome and Sicily. The film was very pleasent to look at throughout. The music was also very good, although I think they used Nino Rota's original theme a bit too much.Of course, if you compare Part III to the first two films, your going to come up with tons of problems with it and probably won't like it very much. But on it's own it's a pretty decent movie, there have been tons of better Mafia films (Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco etc..) but it's still alright. What's so disappointing is that the first two are amazing, and the third one is just pretty good. But it says a lot about a series when the worst of the bunch is still a good movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give The Godfather Part III, 6 stars.",7,4,8,7 January 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," It's a crime this film didn't sweep the oscars.
","I consider this film superior to Forrest Gump (the big oscar winner that year) in almost every way possible. Granted, Forrest Gump is a good film, but The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely brilliant piece of art (yes I said art) that, in my opinion, is one of the greatest films ever made. Judging from the scores it got here on the IMDB, many people agreed with me.This just prooves how ego-centric the Oscars actually are. They really aren't about which film is the best, they're about what the simple-minded audience wants to win. Forrest Gump made an absolute killing at the box office, Shawshank did quite poorly. It's likely that the results at the Oscars satisfied more people than it would have had Shawshank won, but that's only because not many people saw it. I'd like to see you find someone who hasn't seen Forrest Gump.If you think this is a one time thing for the Oscars, look at the results for Titanic, a film that I thought was absolute trash, James Cameron's worst. It won a bunch of oscars because everyone on the planet saw it. LA Confidential was the FAR more deserving film of that year, Good Will Hunting was also very good. But since the academy wouldn't want to upset all the idiotic fans of Titanic, it takes the oscars over the deserving film. The only 'NOMINATION' that lousy movie deserved was for visual effects and I thought Starship Troopers deserved the win (which it didn't get, of course).I think it's really sad that our society has become so corrupted by mass hysteria that it can't even figure out which films are great, and which aren't. Forrest Gump is good, The Shawshank Redemption is great. Titanic is crap, LA Confidential is very good (not as good as Shawshank though).",10,0,0,15 September 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The silliest of Python movies
","Holy Grail is easily the silliest of all the Python movies, save And Now For Something Completely Different which isn't really a movie at all but a series of some of the better sketches from the Flying Circus. Of course saying that Holy Grail is silly certainly isn't insulting it in any way, it may be the funniest Python movie ever made, although the humor isn't for everyone. The pure randomness and all out impossibility of everything that happens is what makes it so funny, this is definatly present in their other films but generally not to the degree that is seen in Holy Grail. I have a hard time deciding whether Holy Grail or Life of Brian is the better movie, while Holy Grail tends to get more overall laughs, Life of Brian's jokes seem more intelligent and well thought out. I would say that Holy Grail is better for a first time viewing, but Life of Brian tends to be funnier over repeat viewings.  Both movies are simply fantastic and nothing made nowadays can come close to rivaling the all out hillarity that was Python.
I don't know how you people can not like the ending to Holy Grail, in my oppinion it fit in so perfectly with the rest of the movie. You guys love other odd quips of the same sort such as the holy hand grenade, the animator suddenly dying to kill off a monster, the black knight and cocconuts being used in place of horses yet a completely random and unexpected ending doesn't sit right with you? That just seems strange to me. Personally, I think having a big budget, flashy fight scene at the end would've made the movie seem stale and unoriginal, it simply wouldn't fall in with the style of the rest of the film. They needed to put in something that would make audiences say 'What the hell was that all about?' at the end at that's exactly what they did.While the members of Python have now gone their seperate ways you can still see the same type of wackiness coming up in newer movies they've contributed to. I would say the most prominant would be the films Terry Gilliam has directed, most of them aren't meant to be funny but the aching attention to detail he puts into his strange, chaotic sets will often remind you of something out of Python. The best examples would be Brazil and to a lesser extent Twelve Monkeys, both strange, fantastic movies, even though they're not particularly funny.",9,1,1,15 June 2001
