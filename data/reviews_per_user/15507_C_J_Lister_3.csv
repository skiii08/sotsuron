10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Cloverfield Lane
","10 Cloverfield Lane is the spiritual successor to Cloverfield. Although not a direct sequel to Cloverfield it does share an overall tone and general creepiness that the first film had in spades. The sense of tension and dread that was present throughout the film was remarkable, and it impressed me that they could maintain that throughout the film. The well-crafted story that was expertly written by Damien Chazelle, Josh Campbell, Daniel Casey, and Matthew Stuecken. The directing was also on point, and both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman stole the show with their performances. I did not see that ending coming. It was a delightful movie to watch, and I wished we got a direct sequel to this film just like I wanted for Cloverfield. Oh well. A great film to check out during our self-isolation.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Se7en," Se7en Review
","I ask myself why Se7en is so great? The answer to that question is rather simple because it was directed by David Fincher, who is known for being a perfectionist. Se7en is one of a kind. With its unrelenting dark and gritty visuals, David Fincher beautifully employs the use of rain, the twisted legal system and gore to create something which was both thrilling and well written. This film has a fantastic cast. From Freeman's controlled performance playing Somerset who loves books to Pitt's angry follows his gut who loves a chase. Yes, their partnership is pretty cliched, but it's forgivable because both Pitt and Freeman do such a remarkable job playing these characters. Not to mention that ending which will play in my mind for days after watching-something I adore in a film.",7,0,0,20 March 2020
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men Review
","I do love these types of movies. You have one location and a bunch of actors that have to play off one and another to sell the story and their performances. This is when you can tell whether you're a great actor or just a good actor. It helps that the script was incredibly well written too. This film captives the audience from the very beginning and doesn't let you go until it's over.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.Henry Fonda knocks it out of the park with his performance in this film. You can feel his characters discomfort as the others belittle and mock how he can believe this young man could be innocent. You feel for him. You also share in his victories as he slowly casts doubt in each of the jurors' minds. For me, Henry Fonda should have at a bare minimum been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, and although it would have been a tough call, he should have won it too. Because in my opinion, his performance was better than Alec Guinness performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai.I just wished they made films like this today.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
