Catch Me If You Can," An entertaining film
","Just a short piece about 'Catch Me..'  (no spoilers here).  I think Leonardo C  was correctly cast. They needed someone who could pass for age 18 but also who was pretending to be  8 or 10 years older, as the featured main-character/con artist. He does look awfully young, but I think it came off ok.   The understated score was by Williams (no surprise) but was very different from other works he has done, and generally works well for the film. It is as unlike the score for Harry Potter as night and day, and does demonstrate Williams' versatility (although Schindler's List has long since put any concerns in that area to rest). I was not able to identify the composer prior to seeing his name, momentarily wondering if it might possibly be Dave Grusin or perhaps J. N. Howard or even Howard Shore.  The director is an excellent storyteller, but I am left wondering how others might have handled certain treatments.  There was good audience reaction and I would imagine it will continue to do well at the box office.  I would like to find out what the budget was, but for dart-throwing fun I would guess it at $75mil.  Tom Hanks as the hapless FBI agent-in-charge is entertaining as well, and Christopher Walken also has a good part in this. I would imagine that I will see this film again, sometime.",8,1,1,29 December 2002
The Aviator," Slick & modern but animation effects were over the top.
","Today we saw The Aviator, in a full house. I liked it. I knew it would be long, though I did not warn my wife about that or she would not have gone (don't tell). The story moves right along for the most part - - the cutting is very good (as expected) but I feel Mr. Scorsese could have lost 15 or 20 minutes easily, with no loss of story. I also appreciate the reluctance to do so. I am, however, a little frayed with overly used digital special effects, and I do wonder how an old school Scorsese-type would be persuaded to choose this path during the storyboard process. I feel we are now crossing the line, with directors choosing this method over other available effects. The process is just not 100% right. The impossible 'camera' angles are distracting (to my taste, irritating), violating all sorts of physics laws which causes an observant person to instantly question the process of placing animations in serious films, and it therefore becomes a dead giveaway: he knows he is viewing a cartoon. It reminds me of the early days of S-T-E-R-E-O, very few younger people would understand this concept. I think James Cameron gets it but who knows for sure. Digital animations were probably required for this; I am suggesting that some moderation of it and additional use of models might make sense.This would be my prime criticism then, that the effects are in your face; they are anything but subtle in certain scenes. This was true with the other film I saw this weekend (The Flight of The Phoenix), there's relatively little in the way of special effects differences between them. I am witnessing this on an increasing level. All that said, The Aviator visuals are nonetheless impressive (some great plane crashes), and the storytelling, though very good, is artsy. I give the effort a must-see, on balance. This film looks very modern but handles the period feel with brilliance; it is indeed slick. The score and adaptations (Howard Shore) are fitting but not something I'd want to own beyond a possible DVD of the film itself, later on. And you have this: after seeing the film, there is little doubt in your mind who Hughes was, or what sorts of things cranked his gear. -- Don Forbes",8,3,7,27 December 2004
K-19: The Widowmaker," A far more plausible 'Red October'
","I found a world of difference between the more plausible rush-to-launch K-19 and the finely-honed state-of-the-art Red October in the fictional Clancy novel/screenplay.  It's Das Boot, updated and with a Soviet bent. I felt there were excellent performances by all concerned; I could not find fault with any of them, nor with the direction. Some of the cinematography was downright clever, helped along I suppose by newer, lighter camera designs. However, digital water abounds.   Nicely made, but it would have benefitted (sorry, just my opinion) from a more prominent mainstream composer like Horner or Zimmer.  But the Klaus Badelt score works acceptably well, if slightly aimless in the early scenes. Few would have noticed, but the Soviet National Anthem is conspicuously missing (there was a scene where it definitely should have played, at the launching of K-19) and I am wondering about some sort of political disagreement with regard to a sign-off on that. The title music is patterned after the anthem, and most likely that is no accident.  I did not realize permission was required to use an anthem, so am quite curious as to the nature of the back story. I cannot think of a good reason why the melody would not have been used. This is a suspenseful film which I feel finds balance in most if not all aspects of the storytelling. Factual, but 'some of the names were changed to protect the innocent' sort-of-thing.  Certainly there will be disagreement, as the subject matter is so charged with political issues and personal feelings. The portrayal of this incident fits well with all that I know of the facts so far, and of the Soviet military and economic system in general and the politics of the day. Years ago, scenes could not easily be filmed in Russia. That has changed, and the result is refreshing. One of the best films I've seen this year.",9,0,0,21 July 2002
Windtalkers," I was disappointed
","Just a brief review. I expected more of this film, and I fault Woo's direction for not giving us more.  There is such a story to tell about the Windtalkers, and he hardly told anything.  The action was convincing enough but I wondered about some of the characterizations. Actually this was just an ordinary action film under the guise of telling the story of the Windtalkers. I guess I was just expecting more of a story, and a little less of the noisy action.",Null,5,6,23 July 2002
