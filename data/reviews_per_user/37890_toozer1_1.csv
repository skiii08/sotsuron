Hereditary," I don't even like horror films!
","Horror films are among my least favorite genres for a couple reasons: 1) They tend to follow the same generic formula time and time again; 2) I simply don't like the thrills of a horror movie. Not for me. I saw this movie because a friend of mine was interested and I had nothing better to do that night. I went, but I didn't realize it was going to be a horror film. Although I would never see it again for the sake of my own mental health, I can appreciate a great movie regardless of genre.The biggest applause of this movie easily goes to the writer/director, Ari Aster. Every line had a significant purpose, unlike so many movies today where half of the dialogue is simply to get a specific reaction from the audience, regardless of whether or not it makes sense or matters at all. This movie has the writing of a fantastic literary piece. No word is wasted, which is why there are frequent moments in the movie where there's no dialogue. In these moments, the visuals could easily carry this whole movie without a script of any kind.This is another place where the Aster shines. Angles and shots were filmed and chosen carefully. Something that goes to the wayside too often in movies these days is the importance of the camera's position. Every shot should confirm or reveal something about the setting and/or characters. In my opinion, each movie should get a few grace shots as not to set unrealistic expectations. However, it's so important for the camera to capture the mood.Speaking of mood, the lighting sets it perfectly. I don't think I've ever found myself so enthralled with a movie's lighting. I felt like at every turn I was looking over at my friend and praising the job that the team did with lights. It never felt awkward, out of place, or devoid of purpose. This is one of the most perfectly lit movies I've ever seen.On a final positive note, the acting is outstanding. The performances of the entire cast are worthy of their own 10 star reviews. Although Toni Collette was magnificent, I personally was blown away by Alex Wolff. I was very worried when I first realized he was in the movie. My natural reaction was, 'Ugh. Let's not have another Jumanji.' By the end of the film, I was tempted to give myself a few lashes for having doubted him. His emotions were on point and were some of the biggest contributors to the fear I experienced.One negative comment comes back to the writing a little bit. At times it felt like the movie didn't make much sense. The writing even felt sloppy. Upon further reflection during and after the movie, I realized how much everything made sense. However, one thing you don't want your viewers doing during your movie is wondering what in the world is going on.Other than this flaw, the movie is, dare I say, a wonderful work of art.",9,1,2,17 July 2018
