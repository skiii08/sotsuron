Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars fan let down!!!!!
","OK...I will admit it is a very good film..but lets compare....The original Star Wars films were for their time, ground breaking in special effects...you don't even notice them they are that good.  It keeps this genre of Cowboy-Sci-Fi...which is what it is...and the characterisation is brilliant..I love Star Wars don't get me wrong, but the new film........The advances in technology of special effects have twisted it somewhat....it seems to colourful, and you can tell that it is all computer generated graphics, Ewen Mcgregor, while he makes a good Obi-Wan...seems to try and re-create Alec Guinness's accent but it comes across as just taking the p**s!!!!!...ALso...Due to the advances in technology as well regarding special effects...the spaceships and various vehicles used in the Phantom Menace, seem highly more advanced than those in the original trilogy.For me...the only redeeming feature of the whole film is how smooth and amazing the lightsaber fights with Darth Maul are...and Liam Neeson's performance is brilliant...All I can say is....when all three new films are released...do not watch them and then follow with the classics as you will disappointed, due to the fact that this film seems an excuse for George Lucas, being the bad Director he is, to just show off..I'm sorry.but that is what I think...but don't get me wrong as a film, it is very highly entertaning, but as a Star Wars film.....only watch it for the fight scenes....",Null,0,1,26 June 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Perfect!!!
","It is not often a  film comes along where you can say this about it....superb script..superb direction...superb soundtrack, superb storyline, superb acting...SUPERB!!!!...The plot revolves around a group of friends who lost Â£500,000 in a game of Brag...and this creates a torrent of people getting involved from Drug Dealers with an array of Firearms, to the suppliers, to two small time thieves.  All meet eachother in a climatic end, botha funny and disturbing film towards the end.  Highly reccomended viewing..and unlike other films you can watch this over and over and over..and still enjoy it!!!!",Null,1,1,14 April 1999
