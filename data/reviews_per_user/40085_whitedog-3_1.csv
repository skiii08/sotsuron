The Blair Witch Project," Totally disappointed
","With all the hype from the critics, I was one of those lining up in Nuart to see the films the first weekends: and it was boring, uneventful, unconvincing, and not scary. The ending, I admit, is very clever and spooky; but the entire film just doesn't play. There's no immediate sense of danger, no real fear generated from the character's voices. Heather does becomes much more hysterical as the film goes on, but much to the audience's annoyance than much else. Mere attempts to shake the camera simply isn't enough to generate atmosphere.I know some people loved the film: but let's face it, very little people have yet the chance to see it for themselves. The audience at Nuart that day were all disappointed. I wanted to love it, but have been spending time rationalising why I didn't get it.I say, go watch it to see it for yourselves, but beware: you may be disappointed.",3,0,1,24 July 1999
