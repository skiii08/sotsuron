Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The funniest, absurd and downright original comedy in recent memory
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is some of the funniest Movies i have ever seen, this film's characters, jokes, satire and overall absurdness is all above Perfect, the film is absolutely amazing. Here's why.The story follows Borat Sagdiyev, a Kazakhstan immigrant who decides to travel to America to go through everything about it's culture to consider it 'the best Place in the world', as well as his friend Azamat joining in too, but through out his Journey, he stumbles across Pamela Anderson on an episode of Baywatch and decides to locate and marry to her despite her not being a Virgin and already having a husband, but Borat suffers the consequences of going on a long road trip to California to locate her as he experiences friendship loss and abandonment, so it is up to him to locate Pamela Anderson in all his glory.The film strongest aspect is it's main character, Borat is a sexually attracted, Jew hating immigrant who is funny in so many ways, every time he says a line, it gives me a giggle and his personality is Perfect, as he spend throughout the film asking strangers (real People) to help him learn about the American culture and it's society, and it's all done perfectly, blending in tons of laughs and Visual humor and a little bit of drama, but not too much since it's a comedy.The side characters are outstanding too, i really like Azamat for being an arrogant, charismatic and overall pessimistic sidekick to Borat, and most scenes he's in, it really gets in the laughs and cringes perfectly, the real People and as well as Luenell and Pamela Anderson is Perfect, Luenell is a heart-warming lady With passion and sensibility and Pamela Anderson is the celebrity she is, the reactions to all the Citizens are priceless, since they don't know that Borat is a character and they think he's real even though clearly it's a mockumentary.The film is full of weird, cringeworthy and disgusting scenes done in a comedic manner, the scene where Azamat and Borat are fighting naked, had me rolling on the floor laughing while at the same time, making me cringe, the scene With Borat showing a Picture With his Brother naked and questioning the size of his penis is also a cringeworthy scene and the entire Jew premise is Perfect as well.The scene where Borat is kidnapping Pamela Anderson is a shocking scene since it's permanent celebrity craze and Law breaking, but clearly it's all staged, but the scene is still shocking today.Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is one of my all time favourite comedies i've ever seen, it's a clever, weird, well written and overall a very original take on the mockumentary genre and comedy in general, no cons in this Movie at all, it's just Perfect 10/10",10,1,1,23 January 2016
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A film so good, it's the film that refined the action-adventure genre
","First thing to say, i love the Indiana Jones Movies, but the first movie is always my favorite. Everything the film has to offer is outstanding: Action, comedy, romance, history and suspense. So to start my review on the entire series. Let's get started.The film starts With Indy and a thief Satipo finding the Golden Idol in South America, when Indy finds the Golden Idol, a massive Boulder appears, Satipo betrays Indy, then one shot later he dies. The Boulder chases Indy out of the Cave, then he meets with his Arch-rival Rene Belloq, that he tells Jones to give him the Idol, he does then he orders the Group of half-naked people to chase down Indy, Indy luckily Escapes and comes to Jock's plane. In the plane, he finds a snake, and says to Jock 'Snakes, i hate snakes'. A few days later, he's back as a teacher talking about history to the students, after that, Marcus Brody tells Indy to find the Ark of the Covenant. He starts his quest by finding Marion Ravenwood, Indy comes in to the cabin and Marion is not happy to see him, because she didn't see Indy in a while. She slaps him and she tells him to come back tomorrow. Three Seconds later, she comes across the evil Gestapo Nazi Agent Arnold Ernst Toht, his first line is 'Good Evening Fr√§ulein'. He tries to torture Marion by burning her with the Medallion she has, Toht fails and Indy comes to save Marion. Then a fight scene comes and Toht tries to take the Medallion, but since it is burned, his hand gets burned and Marion and Indy escapes to Cairo.When arriving at Cairo, Indy meets his companion Sallah and tells him about the Ark and that Belloq and the Nazi's are after it. Later, when Indy and Marion walks across town, they meet a Nazi, then the Nazi steals Marion and Indy tries to find her. After like 3 minutes of finding, he comes across a Swordsman, luckily Indy shoots the guy and the crowd is happy. Indy finds a basket case where Marion is captured. The Nazi puts Marion inside a truck, then Indy spots a truck and the truck explodes, Indy thought that was the truck Marion was in. Later Indy meets Belloq...again and Belloq tells Indy that he's the one that's opening the Ark not Indy, Indy tries to kill Belloq but fails but he luckily got helped by Sallah's kids. Indy and Sallah talks about them two searching for the Ark of the Covenant together. Later they come to where the Nazi's work, Indy and Sallah works together, Indy goes Down to a hidden Place to solve a puzzle where he has to find where the Ark is located. He knows where it is. Belloq and a person finds Company, which is Toht, he shows his burned hand and says 'Heil Hitler'.Indy, Sallah and many others are digging in the spot where the Ark of the Covenant is. They find the area where the Ark is, but it's surrounded by snakes so Indy and Sallah must be careful, they manage to get past the snakes and takes the Ark of the Covenant. This time, Belloq comes and gives Marion something to eat. They drink vodka and gets drunk. Marion tries to Escape with her new dress, but she gets caught by Toht. Toht says his final English Words 'So, what shall we talk about'. Later, Belloq and the Nazi's discovers the People digging for the Ark. When Indy tries to get the Ark up from the area, they get caught by the Nazi's, the Nazi's take the Ark and Marion comes with Indy down the Area. When stuck down the area, Indy finds a way out by smashing a wall with a statue and they escape the area. Indy Chases the Nazi's in this 7-minute scene. Indy rides a horse, drives a truck and defeats a bunch of bad guys. After a long Chase, the Nazi's won't get away. Indy is on a boat to come away from the Nazi's. A day later, the Nazi's have located a boat with Indy on it. Indy tries to Escape and fight the Nazi's one more time to save a captured Marion. Later the boat comes to a small island. There Indy finds the Nazi's and Marion. Indy dresses up as a Nazi so he doesn't get caught. The Nazi's are seen walking with the Ark to the Place to open the ark, but shortly after, Indy is seen holding a bazooka trying to shoot the Nazi's. Belloq says to Indy that he can shoot the Ark, but he declines and gets captured and stuck on a pole.The Nazi's are prepared to open the Ark, Belloq dressed as a priest opens the Ark along with Toht and a German Nazi Dietrich. When they open the Ark of the Covenant. Spirits come flying by, and the final Words said by Belloq is 'It's beautiful' A ghost comes to Toht, where the ghost has a pretty face then the Next split-second turns to death. The others Nazi's dies by Lightning, Dietrich's face shrivels up, Toht's face melts and Belloq's face explodes on-screen. The ghosts go back in the Ark and Marion and Indy are free. One moral: Don't mess with God. Indy returns the Ark to Brody, they said that the Ark is not going to the museum, but in a Warehouse owned by top men.Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best films i've ever seen. The film's humour, action sequences, acting, practical effects, villains, characters, script, fight scenes, cinematography, directing, Opening sequence and the Whole film is outstanding. No cons at all. This film is recommended for anyone, please note that this film has a few scary scenes, so if children can handle the melting scene, kids can watch it too",10,1,2,17 July 2015
The Babadook," One of the most chilling, emotional and intense horror films of the last decade
","The Babadook is an example of a horror movie done right, this film is a true masterpiece in modern horror, instead of being a jumpy Movie, it is instead a chilling and disturbing Movie that is a enjoyable horror-drama about a mother and her son in the wrong ways.The story follows Amelia, after witnessing her husband's death during a car crash while giving birth to their son Samuel, Amelia must stop Samuel from going crazy over about a monsters, but when Samuel finds a book named Mr Babadook in his room, they read it, after finding out that the book has a slight creepy image, then Amelia experiences that Samuel has gone mad over Babadook, but when after Amelia put the book on the shelf high, at one point, the book can be seen again and she tears the book apart, then after ripping the book and days went, the book comes back, this time With horrific showings of Amelia in paper form killing her dog and son. Then Amelia experiences The Babadook all around her and must stop him from killing Samuel and herself.The film is scary as hell, it's tone and atmosphere is exquisite and it's performances are top-notch despite being having the most annoying kid in any Movie: Noah Wiseman. This film has no jumpscares, but instead delivers are rather disturbing feel to this Movie, each character is emotional and have their own personality.The Babadook's design is a mixed bag, he looks good in the pop-up book but in person, he seems like a pretty basic monster With claws and being hidden in the shadows for the most of the Movie and when we see his face, his face is shown for a split second, so overall great design but not a masterpiece.The peril Amelia and Samuel have is intense and makes up for the creepy atmosphere of the Movie. The real shocker is the pop-up book, it shows murder, monster coming out to kill and many others. The book is a highlight for the film.The Babadook is a brilliant film, acting, Music, tone, atmosphere, lack of jumpscares and emotional story makes this a fantastic horror film for New and old horror fans, the film has flaws like Noah Wiseman's character and a few outdated effects but don't miss this.10/10",10,1,4,9 September 2015
The Godfather: Part II," Better than the original and the best sequel i've ever seen
","I really enjoyed The Godfather, so i decided to see The Godfather Part 2 if it's better or worse, and to my utter surprise, it's better than the original and has one of the best performances in a Movie ever. This film is a true masterpiece. Here's why.The story is as good as the original, this time the film has two separate story lines: Vito Corleone as a Young man and Michael Corleone's storyline. Vito Corleone's story follows his life as he evacuates from New York and to Italy by his parents in 1910 and goes through his normal day life, and Michael Corleone's story follows him being accused for being a criminal by the Law after being framed by his Brother during a celebration when another criminal did the illegal Activity that happen in the celebration and Michael goes through Family life and has a divorce With his wife and all that stuff and must prove that he isn't guilty of the actions caused by a another person.The film's direction is one of the biggest strengths of this film, it's switch between Vito and Michael is done in a good pace and well choreographed camera transitions makes this film direction nearly a masterpiece. The performances especially once again Al Pacino is so good, it deserved an Oscar for best performance, for a reason, Pacino's character is so emotional, you really care for him in the scenes With his wife. Oustanding i must say.The film, despite being a serious drama, has some funny moments, like where one of the characters gives Vito Money and continuously regrets it, now that was funny, but the film really is quite serious apart from that one scene, that's why the change of pace makes this quite comforting of a Movie.The characters are better and the film is longer, The Godfather Part 2 is one of the best films i've ever seen, Performances, humor, drama, direction, Music and characters are great, there is nothing terrible With this Movie.

Bridge of Spies," Spielberg went back to his route's with this beautiful and intense drama
","Bridge of Spies was a Movie i knew about from Empire Magazine where i saw the poster for it and it looked quite good since it's directed by the legendary Spielberg himself and then i saw With my friend and my former teacher and i love almost as much as Catch me if you can but not Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan. Here's why this film is a near masterpiece.The story follows a lawyer called James who gets recruited by the CIA to go on a negotiation mission to Exchange the CIA U-2 plane until Francis Powers fails a mission and gets shot Down by the Soviet Union and the plane crashes and now Francis is sentenced for many years in prison due to the crash of the plane and capturing everyone on camera, while a another subplot follows James's Client Rudolf Abel who is considered a spy despite not being a Spy and being a normal East German painter With a wife, and James wants to Exchange his partner With Powers because Rudolf deserves his freedom and James goes on a quest in East Berlin to Exchange partners while having unexpected surprises With Frederick, who is not up to par.First off, the direction is almost as good as Schindler, the accuracy of the real events are pretty Close and the 1957 Brooklyn and East Berlin is well put out to look like the 1950s. The characters are designed uniquely and they have one of the best character driven stories in any Spielberg film. Rudolf is the painter With no Identity, Powers is the pilot accused for one mistake and Frederick is the American who just needs information to get out from prison and last James is the lawyer With kindness and respect to People, they all are Perfect and well choreographed.The performances especially Tom Hanks is the strongest aspect of this Movie, Tom Hanks brings his signature trademark which is his emotions and respect to People which makes him a likable character and you really feel sorry for all he is going through. Mark Rylance is pretty good as he also brings the emotions and struggles the pain of being considered a spy while not being one at all.The film has some problems but they're not too big, the ending is too long, like you think the film is done after the Exchange of partners and Frederick release from prison but no, there's 10 minutes more of James getting back home and hiding his adventures until his wife finds it out and he takes a nap without the wife noticing his innocence, i just thought the ending just dragged on, but it isn't terrible The dialogue can be nifty at times, especially from Frederick and one of the CIA agents, they just don't deliver them as much as the others, and the film's score by John Williams is kinda forgettable at best, but it's still there.Bridge of Spies is a near Perfect Movie With great performances, direction, drama, setting, characters, Development, story and accuracy but the dialogue, score and the ending is weak but this film is Worth it nonetheless 9/10",9,0,1,29 December 2015
The Shining," Horror at it's finest, but the film isn't scary
","The Shining is a shiny example on a horror film easily described as a psychological drama, this film is the best Horror flick i've seen at this point, while the film is a slow film With poor following to the novel, it is a timeless horror masterpiece, the film while creepy and intense isn't scary. Here's why.The film centers around a Haunted isolated hotel where a Family goes to as caretakers for the Winter. While in the hotel, The son of the Family Danny experiences strange visions from past and the future while the dad Jack Torrance, an alcholic writer goes insane and begins murdering everyone in sight, while Jack has the same hallucinations as well, while the mother Wendy Torrance must find out as well for Danny the case why Jack is crazy, With Dick Hallorann helping Danny out, when he Calls out The Shining.The film's atmosphere is dark and fascinating, the opening shot already explains that the Movie is dark and creepy, and it is, but the issue With it, is the lack of scares, this doesn't produce any scary direction whatsoever.The acting is good, but god does Shelley Duvall suck, her voice makes me petrified Beyond belief, hate when that crap happens, Danny's performance is the highlight, he delivers it great With such serious manner. Jack's performance was good, but not great, the script could have been better.The Shining is a great example for a horror flick but the film lacks pacing and scariness and acting could've been better, overall great Movie but has it's flaws, The shower scene is the part that nearly got me, the other scenes not, i saw the 115 minutes Version and saw deleted scenes the other day. Highly recommend for a horror individuals10/10",10,0,3,7 August 2015
The Lego Movie," A constantly hilarious and entertaining movie for the whole family
","The Lego Movie is one of those films where you shouldn't judge a film by it's cover, making a film based on Lego's sounds stupid right? Yeah, but this film is far from stupid, it's the best animated film of 2014 and one of the funniest animated films of all time IMO, here's why.The story follows Emmet Brickowski, a ordinary Construction worker who lives a daily life in Bricksburg With his best friends, until he accidentally stumbles across a woman and starts following her which causes Emmet to fall Down a pit and finds the Piece of Resistance, since he found this piece, he is now considered the Chosen one and a master Builder even though he isn't one of them, since he is a Master Builder, he must stop Lord Business from taking over the world and With help by comedic side characters and many others.The film's characters are amazing, Batman is very funny and Bad Cop is the best character in the film IMO. I thought Benny was pointless and Unikitty was a bit annoying but i really like the other characters, especially The Man Upstairs.The film's humor is pretty good, many in-jokes and pop culture References that will keep you pumped up, especially the Terminator and Indiana Jones References shown in the Movie, there's many Visual jokes, verbal jokes and all kinds of humor thrown in.The film's live action scenes are pretty emotional and well crafted, because of the father and son relationship and the effects of The Man Upstairs breaking the Lego pieces, which causes the world to break as well.There is no real issues With the film, but the Everything is awesome song is annoying and the film is way too similar to The Matrix, but that's it really.The Lego Movie is a funny and clever animated film. The humor, Message, emotional scenes, Music, characters and plot is good, but some songs are annoying and the film is way too similar to The Matrix. Check this film out.10/10",10,1,3,14 February 2016
Inside Out," A new turn for Pixar but also a great one
","Inside Out is a original and a clever Movie about mind-manipulation, this film is gorgeous-looking and one of the best Pixar has done in a good long time. The film's acting and charm is what makes it a emotional experience for both kids and adults, here's why.The plot is original, it follows Riley, a normal 11-year old who moves to San Francisco With her mom and dad, and inside Riley's mind are Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger who each produce emotions to Riley every time they Control her mind, but when Sadness touches one of the memories of Riley by accident, Joy and Sadness get sucked into the world of Islands which follows what kind of stuff Riley likes and hates and barks on a quest for Return before she gets neutral and out of Control.The characters are memorable and touching, every emotion has Development and the best character to me from all emotions is Anger, his character just Cheers me up, Bing Bong is a good character and the Unicorn's a good minor character.The animation is their best work yet, With so much detail and lighting, that it looks like a painting, the complicated concept is stunning, it gives a New direction for Pixar, compared to their simple plot Points in their previous films, this one is a tough watch due to it's emotional but realistic turn, but their children will love it.The film is one of the most heartfelt Pixar films i've seen, the film is both funny and sad at the same time, the part where Riley takes mom's credit card and leaves is upsetting yet intense, that was the most intense part to me.Inside Out is a outstanding achievement in Pixar's career, both funny and heartfelt, With outstanding animation, heartfelt story and original and smart concept, the only downside is that awful short film, which i'll review a another day.10/10",10,1,21,7 August 2015
Saving Private Ryan," Realistic, brutal and superbly acted, this film is a masterpiece
","Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece and one of Spielberg's finest Movies, the Battle scenes, performances and the film keeping true to World War 2 makes this a brilliant but tough watch. Here's why.The story is good but could've been better, it follows a bunch of soldiers who lands on Normandy, France and successfully defeating the Germans on their first encounter, they must track Down a Survivor of the Normandy incident that happened earlier before they arrived by the chief of the army, so Captain Miller and his soldiers must get Private James Ryan, the Survivor back home and end the war in Normandy and World War 2 itself.The film's ending is something i have to mention, it's so emotional and one of the most best bad endings of all time, where Captain Miller does Deus Ex Machina on an upcoming tank and somehow saves his teammates but he himself dies, and in present time, James Francis Ryan goes to his funeral and also tells his wife to say he is a good man, for all his work during World War 2, it's sad but impressive overall.The Battle scenes are impressive, With some of the most realistic depictions of war ever put into film, each Battle scene is at least 10 minutes which adds to the overall excitement of the film's slow pacing. The film's performances are stunning especially Tom Hanks, all has their own emotion which makes each character interesting and refreshing.The film's direction is as great as previous Spielberg films, here it's all done in a serious matter, where World War 2 is pretty accurate in this Movie than it is in real life. The orchestral is impressive, John Williams is always the king of orchestral Music. The Deaths are pretty emotional, and even myself feel sorry for all of the teammates dying despite the characters being fictional and i still had a hard time seeing these likable characters die.Saving Private Ryan is a benchmark for film Entertainment and it is one of my favourites to this day. Direction, characters, performances, Music, realism, World War 2 accuracy, ending and the overall emotion to the Death scenes makes this a must-watch for anyone willing to watch a great War flick. The only weakness of this Movie is the plot, it's simple and has to have more focus on some of it's locations like Ohama Beach and that it is kinda flat in the middle part of the Movie, other than this minor nitpick, check this Movie out.10/10",10,2,3,10 October 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson's wit and style is here, and it's his best work yet
","I love Wes Anderson's Movies, Moonrise Kingdom was great, Fantastic Mr Fox was great and yes i even liked The Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou. However Grand Budapest Hotel beats all of them for the film's Incredible dark humor, art style and a emotional ending. Here's why this film is a masterpiece.The story follows an Author who goes to Grand Budapest Hotel and while in his visit he meets Zero Moustafa, a lonely man who tells the Author all about his past in the Grand Budapest. The main story has 5 parts and each follows concierge Monsieur Gustave and his lobby boy Zero as Gustave gets send to prison for murder despite him being innocent in reality. While on the way, Zero befriends a girl who is a pastry chef and two evil criminals are trying to get a painting named Boy With Apple that Gustave loves very much, but is stolen by Gustave. Gustave and his jail pals must Escape jail to prove his innocence and that the criminals where the ones being sent to jail and many quirky adventures along the way.The film is amazing, first off, the art style is absolutely outstanding, it's aspect ratio is what makes the Movie genius, since it switches from normal to old. The performances especially Ralph Fiennes is brilliant, he delivers the laughs just right as well as his touching feel you came to expect from a Wes Anderson Movie, The film's humor is dark and zany, all done is a good pace and makes it Wes Anderson's most entertaining Movie yet. The ending is sad, where the film ends With a woman going to the grave of Gustave, the main character.The characters are memorable, notably Agatha, the pastry chef and Dmitri, the villain. The film has it problems though but not very big. The film could have been longer, the film's climax is somewhat disappointing, Part 4 is the worst of all 3 parts and the film's choreography falls flat to it's stellar design of the style.Grand Budapest Hotel is the best Wes Anderson flick yet, the film's humor, drama, style, characters, aspect ratio and overall direction is great, but the film is only 100 minutes, the climax is disappointing, Part 4 has somewhat a dumb feel compared to 1,2,3,5 and choreography is linear. Recommended absolutely 10/10",10,2,4,30 September 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," The best and most realistic drama film i've seen in ages.
","Shawshank Redemption is the best Movie i've ever seen, it does everything right, cinematography, story, characters, realism and the scope. This is a true masterpiece, no other film can possibly beat this. If it wasn't for this film, it wouldn't like myself anymore.The story follows Andy Dufrense, a alcholic who gets framed for murder of his wife and get sent to prison, while in prison, he meets Red, a lovable prisoner who joins his years in prison to find a way a out of prison and along the way, help out the evil Warden Norton, while going through redemption and solace for Dufrense's Escape.The film is beautifully written, With script so good, it makes every Movie-goer happy. The characters are intense and well-developed, they socialize in so many ways, like Brooks and Tommy, Brooks is a Liberian who has poor life, in the end committing suicide for his own will, and Tommy being a troubled Family man who must learn the alphabet to become better at vocabulary, but getting shot by one of the henchmen that Warden has. The acting is great, especially Morgan Freeman, he can't get any better. Tim Robbins is good as well, being more dramatic and personal than before.The film is one of the most realistic prison films i've seen, the violence is shown in full view, sometimes off-screen and the Language is guaranteed, this is why this film is a adult Movie, sure sensitive kids can handle it, but it's so realistic, that's it's just too much to handle.Shawshank Redemption is the best Movie i've seen...period, no other film can bring that much realism and drama than this masterpiece, it's just beautiful, this is absolutely a must watch, should not be overlooked, despite being a huge Box Office flop, it's fantastic and possibly the best since Godfather.10/10",10,0,1,17 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A satisfying return to the series with minor problems
","I was all hyped up for the newest Star Wars Movie after so many years, excluding the horrible prequels, but when i found out that J.J. Abrams was the director, my hopes were brutally dashed and thrown out the window, but at least Disney was gonna be distributing the Movie, then finally in December 2015, the Movie was released, and the end result was a success but it isn't all Perfect, here's why.The story is set 30 years after the events of Revenge of the Sith, the Galatic Empire has been destroyed and one of the last Jedi's being dead meat, a New threat has appeared in the Galaxy, The First Order, where they want the entire Galaxy demolished, the leader of the First Order, Kylo Ren, wants to seek the last Jedi and kill him, which is Luke Skywalker, along the way, a stormtrooper part of the Resistance called Finn and a scavenger named Rey who With help by Han Solo, Chewbacca and returning characters including a New character named Poe to infiltrate the rebel base and find the missing Jedi Luke Skywalker.The film's nod to the original trilogy is executed wonderfully, with the drama, humour, action and the horrors from A New hope, Empire strikes back and little bit from Return of the Jedi, but the story is too similar to A New Hope with infiltrating a rebel base, showing a planet being blown up and of course, returning characters, while that's a major problem, it isn't too bad The New characters especially Finn and Poe are pretty strong but Rey and Kylo Ren are not, Rey is just a typical orphan with not much strength and capabilities for combat except a stick and Kylo Ren's face reveal is pointless and he could have kept the mask on, but Finn is a interesting, funny and melodramatic character and Poe is a great newcomer with an interesting character Development and charm. The villain Supreme Leader Snoke and Captain Phasma are brief but interesting characters but Maz Kanata is a dull sidekick just shown for 5 minutes.The First Order is just Galatic Empire but less interesting and has a boring set of minor characters, the Death of Han Solo was sad but at the same time, unpleasant due to inconsistency in the plot and the cliffhanger ending just had us waiting 3 years extra for the sequel, way too much Movie.Star Wars Force Awakens is one of the better star wars films in the franchise and the second best IMO, the action sequences, humor, drama, characters, nod to the original trilogy and i forgot to mention, the BB-8 is outstanding as well as the score by John Williams, but the similar plot, villain, First Order, and the inconsistency of the ending is a bargain, but a must watch for any Star Wars fan or newcomer 9/10",9,1,16,25 December 2015
Deadpool," Constantly hilarious and action-packed, Deadpool is the perfect superhero movie
","I saw Deadpool With high expectations, i've been a fan of the character since the video game where i first knew about the character, the Comics were pretty good too but i haven't read a lot of it, and when i heard they announced a Deadpool Movie, i just screamed in joy, i saw the Movie a week after it's release and here is my thoughts.The story is predictable but not bad. A former Special Forces operative now mercenary named Wade Wilson likes doing crime and being a villain, but one day in a bar, he meets Vanessa and they instantly fall in love, until one day, Wade collapses to the floor and the next day, he finds out that he is diagnosed With thermal cancer and that he will have a few days of survival, but a recruiter at the bar he goes to says he can give him Powers and Cure the cancer. Wade agrees and is sent to a facility where People get their Powers, the leader of the facility Ajax (villain) tortures Wade and straps him up to a machine, the machine while giving him Powers, made his face disfigured and burnt, his New Powers are regenerating Health and invincibility, now Wade must seek revenge on Ajax for both making his face disfigured and for stealing his girlfriend, so Wade becomes Deadpool With the help of Weasel and Al, old lady, and he Slices his way through the city of Vancouver to get to Ajax and fulfill his revenge With help by Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead.Ryan Reynolds in this Movie is absolutely stunning, he is the Perfect Choice for Deadpool and his wit and sophistication is wonderful. The characters are pretty good too, while Ajax is a bland villain, i really liked Weasel and especially Al, they're both funny supporting characters and they will never be forgettable. Even Dopinder is a great character, i would have liked if he had a bigger role, but he is still a great character.The film's main selling point is the humor and is also one of the film's strengths, the humor is near Perfect With a lot of in-jokes, fourth wall humor from Deadpool, pop culture References, Visual humor and vulgar humor, all of them work, even the jokes that suck are pretty good, because they are supposed to be bad on purpose, which makes the humor even better.The Source material is top notch, everything from the fourth wall humor and the characters is very like the Comics, this is one of those Comic book films, where it follows the Comic book perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, some of the best i've seen in years, they're fast and very gory and profane, the scene where Deadpool shoots Three guys With one bullet is some of the best piece of action ever put into film, it's absolutely marvelous.The film isn't by any means Perfect, the story like i said earlier is predictable and the origin story feels kinda rushed compared to the Comics, and the villain is bland and forgettable, and sometimes the jokes can wear off, but other than that, the film is amazing.The climax and post credits scene is amazing, the climax is funny and exciting and leaves you wondering and the post credits scene is especially awesome, since they're Deadpool tells the audience that there is gonna be a Deadpool sequel featuring Cable and making jokes about actors and films along the way, so excited for the sequel.Deadpool is one of the funniest and exciting films i've seen in years, it's ambition, humor, characters, Source material, action sequences and did i forget to mention, the soundtrack With Music by DMX and Salt n Pepa is pretty good, the story as well as it's origin story is predictable and the villain is bland and some jokes are a little clunky, but this film is Worth recommending, guaranteed.10/10 Btw, the film is very damn vulgar AF",10,2,11,24 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A violent, funny and exciting action thriller for adults
","Kingsman: Secret Service is fantastic, it just delivers a lot of thrills and violence that it is nearly unbelievable, this film is one of the best of 2015. I saw this the first time when i was on a plane, i saw the airline version.The plot is about how a promising street kid whose mom is poor with an abusive father and a baby, joins the Kingsman to stop a Tech genius from using a Sim-card, which allows free-internet to cause people to go insane and go on a murderous rampage, it's up to Eggsy, the street kid to stop him and his assistant from releasing the Sim-card to the public.The film is very good, so good in fact, it's much better than any other Matthew Vaughn Movie before that. The script in this Movie is both funny and well written, while the performances are top notch, the film just falls flat when compared to it's likable characters, most of the characters are good, but some can be forgotten.The violence is good, but there's just too much of it, it's like Kick-Ass just not as realistic. The shout-out for the film is of course Colin Firth, he is fantastic, he delivers the lines perfectly. The film is also funny, some scenes made me laugh like the part where Galahad said he was a Catholic whore and where the dinner at the Meeting with the villain was McDonalds Food.The Church scene is if not the most violent scene i've seen in a action-comedy, this seen includes every single ways to die as possible, impalement, shooting, getting fire in the hair, Axe and stabbing.When i saw the trailer for this Movie, i didn't expect it to be that violent, literally. When i saw the trailer, i thought it was a PG-13 Movie, but i was wrong, it's violent, rude and has sexual References.Kingsman: Secret Service is a fantastic film, the Music, action scenes, script, acting, characters and plot is great, despite the violence being a bit much innit (pun intended) and a few character Development issues, otherwise great Movie, recommended for the People who are sensitive.10/10",10,3,9,17 July 2015
The Martian," One of the best of 2015 with some problems
","The Martian is a great but not overly perfect movie with Matt Damon, i saw this movie, a day after it's premiere here in Norway, and i'm impressed. This movie successfully brings back the routes of Ridley Scott after his disappointments like Prometheus and Avatar. Here's why this movie is great.The story follows Mark Watney, an astronaut who after failing a mission on Mars due to a storm and his crew member left him behind, he is the only one on Mars and must use all his food and shelter on Mars to live and give contact to everyone on Earth that he is alive and that he isn't dead, while on Earth, they must find solutions to help Watney get back to Earth.The direction of Ridley Scott in this movie is spectacular, this film is very funny and as well as emotional. The humour is all done perfectly, especially the tone of the film being rather different than most science fiction movies. The music is great as well, with music by Abba and Gloria Graynor and it's orchestral by Harry Gregson Williams is great as well being rather epic than it's movie.The performances especially Matt Damon's performance is one of the best of this year along with Julianne Moore in Still Alice. Matt Damon's wit and sarcastic personality makes his character likable and interesting. The film's visual effects is stunning, Mars looks so real and space is fully detailed. The scientific accuracy is pretty accurate, NASA status of this movie does it perfectly.I have never read the novel so i can't compare it to the movie. The film isn't perfect though. The film's biggest issue is the film's length and the sequence where people on Earth from Times Square and Trafalgar Square are seen watching NASA talking about the savings of Mark Watney, i thought it was awkward and the film, even though 141 minutes still felt long, the film's characters were less exciting than the main character but Chiwetel Ejiofor and Aksel Hennie did pretty good, but i thought Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig were not a good cast for the characters, but that's just me.The Martian is not perfect, but it is one of the most entertaining films this year along with Kingsman. The humour, drama, direction, visual effects, scientific accuracy, likability, music and stunning art direction is great, but it's length, conclusion and some of the casting and characters were not my taste. Check it out, even the 3D is good.10/10",10,1,41,4 October 2015
The Godfather," An aspiring classic and one of the most memorable in cinema
","From a stand point, The Godfather is one of the most epic and flawless Movies to be ever made. Everything from the direction to the fantastic art style and tone, this film is amazing. Here's why this is one of the most influential Movies today.The story is great, in the 1940s, an aging patriarch is getting tired of his job and constantly struggles through Family life until he gets shot by a criminal, due to his damage on his chest, his son Michael Corloene takes over as patriarch and must infiltrate a series of criminals and live a New life in Sicily but the criminals Michael is looking for is after him and his Associates, With that in mind, he must protect everyone from this nasty spree from happening and have both New York and Sicily back in business.The film's direction is a miracle, the film really is a serious gangster drama than most drama's With a touch of humor, this film has none of that, each character has the own respective emotion which makes the character more like a Virtual reality game than a fictional character in a Movie since the characters are portrayed realistically and that makes the film bring more attention to the Viewer than it's general audience.The performances are fantastic especially Al Pacino, they really act like real life People which makes their acting skills nearly improvised, i must confess that Marlon Brando can sounds kinda wheezy and talks to quiet, but he is good but Al Pacino is the star of this Movie.The art style is great, the film has a Perfect use of film grain and color which makes the film looks more realistic and appealing than usual.The film is without it's problems, but pretty minor, the film's story can get to complex sometimes but that's a nitpick, other than that, the film is flawless.The Music is great, sounds just like what a gangster soundtrack should be.The Godfather is one of the best films of all time, the direction, soundtrack, performances, art style, story and it's emotions to it's characters make's this film appealing, the film's too complex but still don't overlook this Movie.10/10",10,0,1,23 October 2015
