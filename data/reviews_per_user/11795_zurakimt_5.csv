The Avengers," Marvel Does it Again
","I Watched 'Marvel's Avengers' at the Cinema in 2D, I was amazed & excited.The cast, special effects, plot, action sequence are way beyond my expectations.'The Hulk' played by Mark Raffalow is fantastic the looks very realistic comparing with the other previous Hulk movies. Of course I don't have anything wrong to say about this movie. All other characters have done a very good job. Loki's appearance is very well done by showing his cunning attitudes, villain looking face, my god I love him acting like that. Better than the appearance in the movie 'THOR'. Some reviews say the the movie has to experience in 2D, but I am not going to take a change, I will watch this in 3D too. But I hope that 2D is better than 3D though.All I have to say is 'WOW'.

Changeling," Classic Masterpice of 1928
","I waited for this movie to come on HBO. Finally it arrived. I never thought that the movie will get so thrilling. In fact I was amazed with the script. Anjelina Jolie makes the movie interesting all the time. first class performance by her. And one of my favourite actors, John Malkovich. 100% commitment towards the movie. Excellent acting, voice & character matching. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to the end. Awesome, and hoping to watch again. This are called movie to watch. If anyone who reads my review, go ahead, if you love classic murder, suspense & thriller, this is the movie to watch.CheersZurakim Tai City of Kandy Sri Lanka (+094)",7,1,4,11 January 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Optimus Vs. Fallen; A New War Has Begun
","I don't know why all this American people hate this movie. I am a fan of Transformers since school days. they don't know anything about this movie. All I have to say is the 2nd franchise is filled with more action, a good plot, new characters & Shia Lebouf/Megan Fox/Tyresse Gibson makes the movie happen as usual. I am happy to say that Megan Fox plays a good roll and acting than the 1st Transformers movie. Well I don't know what all others who watched this movie is thinking. To tell the truth if someone makes a better movie with a good plot, they know how to insult the people who made it. Again for a bad movie it is all good for them. I think all this European, American's are nut heads. They don't know how to respect people and their hard work. It is a habit of humans that they do not appreciate great work of a intelligent human being. Finally all I have to say is 'Revenge of the Fallen' is a top class movie with state of the art special effects with a good story. Hope everyone understands that!",7,13,22,12 July 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Classic Movie Experience
","Well. I don't have anything to say but, the movie was 100% great. Morgan Freeman is the man. Superb acting & great story with everyone in the family can watch this movie together. Anyone haven't watched this classic movie, please watch it. It's worth it buying the original DVD from Amazon or CD Universe. The script is greatly done. Movies like this are more offently released. I watched it twice & I have the original DVD with me. Talking about 'Stephen King' great writer & I loved his films such as 'Secret Window', 'Red Rose', 'The Mist', 'Pet Semetary' are some of the movies I really preferred watching. The good thing is that this movie are released by all the good production companies like Castelock Entertainment, Warner Brothers & 20th Century Fox.That's all. Again great movie. Watch it!!!",8,0,0,14 December 2008
The Conjuring," Scariest movie since 'The Exorcist'
","I watched the movie along for about 30 minutes, and I couldn't continue. Called over my wife to watch it with me. She even did not want to watch it too. Too scary.The script, acting, cast was excellent. James Wan does it again. good job man and keep it the excellent work.The scariest movie I've seen is 'The Exorcist' until 'The Conjuring' showed up. I watched the blu-ray, and must say the sound mixing was great. I bet that anyone who watches this movie, definitely want go out in the night alone.Warner Bros & New Line scared the hell out of me.My vote is 8/10",8,0,1,13 November 2013
