Requiem for a Dream," The dream of reality
",I am really impressed. After the first half hour of the movie it was so intense and incisive that it was like i was there.I have to admit that Aronofsky knows much about the nature of man. All his movies are perfection when it comes to exposing inner life of people.What i liked most in the movie is the part with the old lady becoming addict to the pills and the TV. TV and some other common society diseases take such part in most human lives which leads to dependence sometimes much more powerful than drugs themselves.The movie is very thrilling! Don't skip!
