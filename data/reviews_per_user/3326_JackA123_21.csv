Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Less blood, more excitement. Thank you Quentin for making Films a bit more fun.
","'I guess I overacted.' -BillKill Bill Vol. 2 is just as fun and good as the first one, but both movies as a whole make a classic. The both were too long to be made into one, so they had todivide it into two halves, and very many different segments. The Bride continues her quest to kill Bill, and must kill two of his associates first. Kill Bill is a smart tale of revenge and vengeance, and gives dialog similar to Pulp Fiction. Vol. 1 was missing emotional scenes and dialog that was very interesting. Bill and the Bride's (Kiddo) conversations were very fun and witty after watching edge-of- your-seat action scenes. Way less bloody than the first and replacing it with more dialog makes it just as good as the original. 9/10 stars. 10/10 stars for both films combined.",Null,0,1,30 May 2004
The Terminator," Terminated.
","'I'll be back.' -The TerminatorThe Terminator is one of the greatest ideas for a sci-fi actioner ever. This is the film that launched Schwarzenegger's legacy of action hero films to come. The
story concerns a machine sent back through time to terminate the mother of a
human resistance leader against machines, while a sergeant is sent back toprotect her.  The Terminator is an edge of your seat cyber thriller that delivers every time I see it. Schwarzenegger is good, but is too stiff. Michael Biehn does an excellent job in portraying his character. James Cameron also gives a great direction. My only small complaint being the special effects (they show the movie's age), but they would only get better within sequel. A  very memorable and great film from the 80's. 9/10 stars.",Null,0,0,30 May 2004
Alien," '2001' meets Jaws
","Alien is an overrated film, but is still very suspenseful and gives some good thrills at times. Ridley Scott does very good with the direction, and the cast is good as well. The story takes place in space, with a ship investigating a planet with a mysterious reading. When they reach the planet, something has enteredthe ship and is killing the crew off one by one. Sigourney Weaver and TomSkerritt are good in the lead roles, while Yaphet Kotto, Veronica Cartwright, and Ian Holm are also good. The movie has too many slow paced moments toactually be an exciting film. The sequel Aliens was superior. Alien is still a good movie, but was somewhat disappointing. 8/10 stars.",Null,0,1,30 May 2004
Taxi Driver," Dark and triumphant; Arguably Scorsese's Best and one of De Niro's best
","'Are you talkin' to me? Are you talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here.' -Travis BickleTaxi Driver is a great film about desperation and loneliness. Robert De Niro's character is one of the greatest in the history of film, as he gives his greatest performance. Taxi Driver is about a night cab driver who becomes fed up with
thugs on the street and that he feels like he should put an end to it. He is rejected by a girl who he likes, so he plans to ruin her work by killing her boss, a senator. He also meets a young prostitute whose pimp treats her with no respect. When he
struggles to help her, he puts another plan into action that will make him a
legend. Taxi Driver is a dark tale that will live on forever with one of the most thrilling climaxes ever. Robert De Niro is excellent in his role. Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and Peter Boyle are also very good. This is Martin Scorsese's best film with the exception of Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Definitely the best movie of 1976 and an all-time classic. 10/10 stars.",Null,0,0,30 May 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Full of Strength.
","'Seven-six-two millimeter. Full metal jacket.' -Pvt. Leonard 'Pyle' LawrenceFull Metal Jacket is a great movie. Not the best from Kubrick, but works great as a war film. The plot is about a group of soldiers who are turned into killers in marine training, and are then sent off to the Vietnam War.Kubrick once again does a great job at directing. Modine, D'Onofrio, Baldwin, and Howard give worthy performances, while Ermey gives an Oscar worthy (not even nominated) performance and steals the show. This is a very realistic look at Vietnam, while the battle scenes and script just aren't as satisfying as they are in the second half. Still, it is a wonderful film.9/10.",Null,65,104,24 May 2004
The Shining," Both scary and thought provoking. One of the scariest films of all time...
","'Come out, come out, where ever you are.' -Jack TorranceThe Shining is definitely one of the scariest films I have ever seen. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel, and was directed by Stanley Kubrick. Jack Nicholson shines as Jack Torrance, a writer who takes his family up to the Colorado Mountains for the winter to take care of a hotel, but the hotel seems to have secrets of it's past. Stanley Kubrick's direction and Jack Nicholson's acting are definitely the high points of the film. I was thrilled from beginning to end and definitely didn't find this movie predictable. I have read the book, and I would call this a poor adaptation. But, this isn't King's movie so I can't really compare the two. Truly, a masterpiece of modern horror.10/10.",Null,1,2,24 May 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," In many ways, Better than the Original.
","'Hasta la vista, baby!' -The TerminatorTerminator 2: Judgment Day is everything that the original wanted to be and
should have been. Nothing about it is dated at all, and it never gets old or dull. The story is about another terminator, much more dangerous than Arnold's in
the original is sent back through time to kill John Connor in person. While a reprogrammed terminator is sent back to protect him. They also head to the
machine's main headquarters and try to destroy the machines once and for all
and prevent the tragic judgment day which cause the war between humans and
machines. T2 is a much more clear and understandable take on the future.
The direction is wonderful, and Schwarzenegger is much better than he was in
the first movie. This may be his best performance, but definitely his most
memorable. The special effects are a landmark and top-notch, and the action
seats are at the edge of your seat with new thrills. In the end, this is an all time classic film getting only better within age. 10/10 stars.",Null,1,1,30 May 2004
Apocalypse Now," Now or Never.
","'The horror. The horror.' -Col. Walter E. KurtzPossible Spoilers herein. Those four words said from Marlon Brando can basically sum up the whole Vietnam War. War is horrific, terrifying, and just plain useless. Apocalypse Now does give that incredible message, yet in a very strange was. Captain Benjamin Willard is sent to go through the rivers of Cambodia to track down a former colonel (Kurtz), and terminate him because Kurtz has gone insane. Kurtz felt betrayed by the country that he fought for, and realizes that war is wrong. As Willard travels closer to Kurtz, he begins to becomes more and more like the man he was sent to kill. Apocalypse Now is definitely one of the best war movies of all time. It is thought-provoking and strange at the same time. Many people might not understand the meaning of this film. Martin Sheen excellently plays Willard, and two very memorable performances by Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall. Look for Dennis Hopper and Laurence Fishburne in a very young role. Wow, what a film. 10/10 stars. -Jack Alexander",Null,0,1,27 May 2004
Apocalypse Now," Now or Never.
","'The horror. The horror!' -Col. Walter E. KurtzMaybe that line sums up the whole horrific, terrifying Vietnam War. Apocalypse Now is one of the best war films of all time. A realistic journey through the rivers of Cambodia. A captain is given orders to terminate a colonel who is hiding in Cambodia and forming his own tribe.Coppola gives a terrific direction, and Sheen, Duvall, Hopper, and Brando gives very good performances. We also get to see a very young Laurence Fishburne. Apocalypse Now Redux is an extended version of the film with better quality. This is a definite war film, one of the best about Vietnam.10/10.",Null,0,1,24 May 2004
Aliens," Bigger, Badder, and Better.
","'Get away from her, you b@#$%!' -Ellen RipleyAliens has always been my favorite of the Alien series. It is action-packed with top-notch thrills and an impressive direction from James Cameron. The story
starts out decades after the first with Ripley being asked to return to the planet where she had her first encounter. She accepts to go and save the life form thatis found there. They find a girl there, but they also find more dangerous readings also. Aliens is a fun film and is much better paced than the original. Sigourney Weaver was Oscar nominated for her performance, very rare for a science
fiction film. Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Jeanette Goldstein give memorable lines and performances and all took part in Cameron's Terminator films. Aliens is an exciting thrill ride which is actually better than the original. 9/10 stars.",Null,0,0,30 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino is back with a brutal vengeance!
","'Leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.' -The BrideKill Bill Vol. 1 is a very good movie, one of the best of 2003. However, it isn't exactly a masterpiece without Vol. 2. The plot concerns a bride who is betrayed on her wedding day. She is left for dead, and four years later she wakes up from her coma. She plots to kill the five people who tried to kill her, and especially Bill. Vol. 1 is one of the bloodiest movies I've ever seen. I have seen Vol. 2, and with the extension of that, makes an instant classic. Both work good on their own, but I don't consider Vol. 2 a sequel. Quentin Tarantino once again writes a great script and selects a great cast. Uma Thurman is great in her role as the Bride with the unknown name. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a smart and brutal revenge tale that will, if nothing else entertain you. 9/10 stars.",Null,0,1,30 May 2004
A Clockwork Orange," The Clock is Ticking.
","'I was cured, alright.' -Alexander DeLargeMy favorite film of all time. A Clockwork Orange is the ultimate satire ever that is twisted and brilliant. The story concerns Alex DeLarge, a criminal who is sent to prison, was cured from his obsessions, and was released, When released, he is taunted by his former victims and friends.A Clockwork Orange had an impact on me like no other movie before. Stanley Kubrick is a master at directing, and here is his best film. Malcolm McDowell is excellent as Alex, giving one of my favorite character performances. If not my favorite film, than at least in my Top 5, and a faithful adaptation to the novel. A masterpiece and easily the best movie of 1971. 10/10 stars. -Jack Alexander",10,5,8,27 May 2004
A Clockwork Orange," My Number one movie, if not, then at least in my top 5....
","'Viddy well, little brother. Viddy well.' -Alexander De LargeA Clockwork Orange is easily the best movie I have seen in a long time. It is the ultimate satire about a young criminal named Alex who went to prison in a not too distant future, was cured from his problems and is haunted by his former victims when he is released. It is a very strange film indeed, but it really works. It is twisted, disturbing, but ultimately brilliant. The whole idea of the film is so great that it works on almost every level and is almost flawless. Malcolm McDowell is excellent and Stanley Kubrick gives the best direction of his career. Excellent.10/10.",10,1,2,24 May 2004
Reservoir Dogs," The Unusual Suspects.
","'Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy? Or are you gonna bite?' -Mr. Blonde/ Vic VegaReservoir Dogs is my second favorite Tarantino film, and my favorite heist movie of all time. The heist that happens is cause by five men who are groupedtogether and given the names of colors for their own safety. The men go to rob a jewelry store, and are surprised when the police show up. Each of the mensuspect each other when they realize that one of them told the police. With a great script and direction, Quentin Tarantino has done an excellent job with a debut. The characters are very likable, with a legendary cast including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney,Chris Penn, and Mr.  Quentin Tarantino himself. The conflict is anti-predicable and very exciting. Listen in for a great 70's soundtrack and a hilarious DJ voice for the radio station 'K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's'. Delightful film.10/10 stars.",Null,0,1,30 May 2004
Pulp Fiction," Orange Juice.
","'Zed's dead, babe. Zed's dead.' -Butch CoolidgePulp Fiction is easily one of the best films of the 1990's. A  priceless script written by director Quentin Tarantino makes the film pure gold. The story isabout two hitmen, a mob boss and his wife, a boxer, and two thieves whosestories are all tied up and connected, told in different segments. The script is hilarious and sometimes serious, it is still a great satire of a film. Again, Tarantino gathers a legendary cast including: John Travolta, Samuel L.Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel,and Christopher Walken. The dialog is never empty at all, the comic humor isnever old, and the suspense is never predictable. While Reservoir Dogs is agreat film, I like Pulp Fiction even better. Tarantino's best and one of the best mob films ever made. 10/10 stars.",10,0,1,30 May 2004
Psycho," Arguably Hitchcock's best.
","'Every boy's best friend is his mother.' -Norman Bates Psycho is the best chiller-thriller of all time, tied in with a huge  mystery. It is so influential many movies have copied and ripped off of it. The famous  story is  about Marion Crane, a business associate who steals 40,000 dollars from  her boss and then runs away to her boyfriend with the money. She stops at  the Bates Motel, and befriends with hotel owner Norman Bates. She is  murdered in the shower that night and Norman is scared stiff when he finds her  dead. He  drowns her body in the swamp that night, but it isn't very long before  the police  and her family come looking for her. Psycho is definitely the most  memorable 'scary' movie I've ever watched. Anthony Perkins is great in his role  (should  have been Oscar-nominated), as is Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and John  Gavin.  Possibly the best from perfectionist director Alfred Hitchcock and one  of the 60's best. 10/10 stars.",Null,1,2,30 May 2004
Platoon," Very Powerful and Moving; One of the best films of the 80's.
","'Somebody once wrote: Hell is the impossibility of reason. That's what this place feels like.' -Chris TaylorPlatoon is my favorite war film based on Vietnam. I really like others like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter, but Platoon is an emotionally draining experience, and powerfully moving. The plot concerns a new recruit in the Army, and his part in the war as he discovers the real meaning of war and which side of the platoon he chooses from, lead by two leaders.A very haunting version of the war, Platoon is truly a classic in every sense of the war. This may be Oliver Stone's best film and Charlie Sheen's best performance. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger shine in the supporting roles as the two sergeants. Platoon is my favorite war movie ever, and it might even stay that way. 10/10 stars.-Jack Alexander",Null,0,1,27 May 2004
The Deer Hunter," Wow. What a depressing, gripping, and emotional movie.
","'One shot, one shot.' -Michael (De Niro)The Deer Hunter is the most accurate portrayal of events before and after theVietnam War. When it does show the war, there is almost no combat, which it
didn't really need because the filmmakers knew that more Vietnam War films
would come someday. Almost none of them were nearly as good as The Deer
Hunter, and even if they were, hey were not as sad. This is a story about three friends and how the Vietnam War effects them before, during, and after the war. Especially when they are held prisoners and are forced to play games of risky Russian Roulette. The Deer Hunter is an emotionally draining experience. The saddest war film I've ever seen, if you even call this a war film. Robert De Niro
 and Christopher Walken are excellent in their roles, and John Savage, Meryl Streep, and John Cazale are also very good. Michael Cimino gives a once in a
lifetime great direction. Easily the best film of 1978 and one of the most
important and powerful war films ever made. 10/10 stars.",Null,0,0,30 May 2004
The Matrix," Whoa. Fast, amazing and outstanding. Hang on!
","'What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge bullets?' -NeoThe Matrix is a very thought-provoking and mindblowing. I always prefer the original over the sequels, mostly because of originality and greatness, and that is exactly what The Matrix delivers. The plot concerns an office worker named Anderson who is told by rebels that he is the savior of their world. The world that Thomas Anderson lives in is the perfect world, but it ends up that the real world outside of the matrix is a place made up of emptiness, with only one city left of mankind. Anderson/Neo's job is to delete viruses in the matrix that are a problem for the real world surviving.The story is very complicating and hard to understand, but it will eventually catch up to you. The Wachowski Brothers give a great direction, while the acting is good at best. Reeves, Fishburne, Moss, Weaving, and Pantoliano are all good in their performances, but nothing special. The action scenes are excellent, some of the best I've ever witnessed in a movie. Overall, a great film with a very interesting and entertaining storyline and thrilling action scenes.9/10 stars.",Null,0,1,9 June 2004
True Romance," No False in this Movie.
","True Romance is a  very good movie, though not great. A very good script andfast action written by Quentin Tarantino. The direction isn't anything special, and I wish that Tarantino had actually directed it. The story has a comic book clerk named Clarence  who meets and falls in love with a hooker named Alabama.Clarence confronts her pimp and takes a briefcase full of cocaine on accident. When Clarence discovers this, the two head for  Hollywood and plan to sell it to filmmakers. The drug dealers pursue them. True Romance is an action-packedlove story that delivers and does well. Good cast including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, and Val Kilmer. A great cast and an impressive script makes the film shine. 8/10 stars.",Null,1,2,30 May 2004
The Godfather," The 'God' of All Films; A Cinematic Triumph!
","'I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.' -Vito CorleoneThe Godfather is a great film, though #1 on the top 250 movie fan list, many people underrate it. I have heard many things saying that The Godfather is overrated, cheesy, and boring. I differ in so many ways. What The Godfather did for me was that it made me look at movies differently. It pretty much started getting me into classic films and I have so glad that it did that. The story is about a family of mob business where everything is going well. Once Vito, leader and father of the family, is wounded everything goes downhill. His son, Michael, kills the leader of the people who ordered his father to be dead, and then leaves town for two years. When he returns, the empire begins to fall and Vito retires.Filmmaking at it's best. Brando gives his greatest and most memorable performance, and probably the same for Al Pacino. James Caan and Robert Duvall also do wonderful in the supporting roles. I've given serious thought about what movie was the best of the 70's, and The Godfather definitely needs consideration. Francis Ford Coppola gives his greatest direction ever in every cinematic angle possible. Easily one of the 70's best.10/10 stars.",Null,0,2,9 June 2004
