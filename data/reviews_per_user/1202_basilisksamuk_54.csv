The Blair Witch Project," Fear of twigs and string
","1 THE SCAM Apparently there is a very scary film called 'The Blair Witch Project'. It is famous for the fact that, although it was made very cheaply using hand held video cameras and the like, it is really, really scary. In fact so scary that it is best to make sure you are wearing your brown trousers before entering the cinema. I thought I was going to see this film but my local cinema tricked me by showing a crap film of the same name which was so badly made that no one else would have been fooled by it. Also it was clearly a fake version as it had zero scares in it. In fact it wasn't a horror film at all but a very bad film made by art students mistaking noise for art who couldn't scare my cat, Xena, who is frightened of anything containing atoms.2 MY THEORY Urban youth in western countries no longer have any initiation rites or rites of passage. Very few of them even go camping anymore and most of them have little experience with things found in the natural world e.g. trees, leaves. Therefore the very idea of spending a night out in the woods fills them with existential dread and they find it easy to identify with the very unpleasant and very whiney stars of this film. Like the characters in the film they are terrified by the sight of a few twigs held together with bits of string or small mounds of rocks. It's sad I know but what other explanation could there be for fear engendered in some viewers of this film? For anyone who has ever spent a night out in the woods it will forever be a mystery why anyone should be prone to fear of twigs and rocks. All we can hope to do is reach out our hearts to those poor young folk living in daily dread of post traumatic twig disorder after seeing this film.3 THE ART OF THE UNSEEN I've always thought that The Haunting (original B&W Robert Wise version) to be the scariest film of all time and will brook no argument. In the proper version of The Haunting the viewer never sees what the horrible thing(s) are that hang out in Hill House but nevertheless the lack of gore and the feverish workings of the viewer's imagination supplied all that was necessary to scare the s**t out of said viewer. Presumably the makers of Blair Witch had the same idea. They failed. Miserably.4 THE ART OF NOISE Another superb feature of The Haunting was the dramatic use of sound to create a feeling of overwhelming terror. Had the Blair Witch makers attempted to engineer the soundtrack and sound effects more professionally I believe they could have turned a deeply s**t movie into one that was at least acceptably a bit prone to cause viewers to worry, a little. They didn't. Instead they opted for making the potentially scary noises inaudible and cranked up the sound of twigs rubbing together until they overpowered everything else on the soundtrack.5 HOW TO COPE WITH SEEING THIS FILM You may or may not be familiar with my dictum that all modern films would benefit from having half an hour cut from their running length. In the case of Blair Witch the film would benefit from having about 75 minutes cut out of its approximately 90 minute running time. In fact, if you are unwise enough to see the entire film you will come out of the cinema convinced that the film ran for at least 17 or 18 hours. In the interests of sanity I advise you to watch until you get to the end of the vox pop scenes and then head smartly for the nearest bar. Have a few good stiff drinks and return to the auditorium to see the last five minutes of the film. This features scenes inside an old house which are accidentally quite good. Then go home and hug a twig.",1,37,71,3 March 2013
The Avengers," True to its Origins
","It almost seems superfluous to add more to the mountain of reviews for this movie but that never stopped me before.When I was a boy I used to go to market stalls and buy Marvel comics (if only I'd kept them I could retire a rich man). So far so normal but this was in the UK where comics meant the Beano and Dandy. You couldn't rely on collecting a whole series of a particular title in the 1960s – it was just a matter of luck what had been imported and was up for sale. It was pretty much a minority interest in the UK. I say this much just to make the point that I have been a fan of Marvel characters for more years then I would like to admit to and so I fit that dreadful fan boy demographic from an earlier generation. I feel I know the characters and I know how they should be treated.Avengers Assemble, as it is known in the UK to distinguish it from a beloved TV series of a different nature, is a film that I was able to enjoy as a fan. The characters were well developed and the interaction between them was particularly well handled and affectionate. The action scenes were well handled, though I have some reservations about the not-always impressive CGI that slipped through in places. I thought it would be too long at 143 minutes but I was never aware of the passing of time whilst watching it and it did not feel like the marathon that some 90 minute movies can sometimes be.Some people have criticised it on the grounds that the plot is too simple and obvious or that the dialogue is too jokey but it fits the requirements for this type of film based on this type of material and what a joy it is to have Whedon's turn of phrase and playfulness. If you want to look at the underlying machinery, then it follows the hero's journey template like many (most?) other successful movies, except it has to fit all the characters into the journey.It's not the world's greatest movie and it's not art house but then it was never intended to be. It's good fun and delivers as much as a fan could want. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk was a stand out for me. The two previous Hulk outings have been pretty awful in my estimation but this was pitch perfect and the Hulk delivered the best laughs in the movie.I don't really know how you compare an art-house movie with a blockbuster fun movie. It probably can't be done. This was great entertainment and I'd sooner have that any day than worthy but dull.",8,0,5,21 May 2012
Black Swan," Hugely Overrated
","Firstly let's dispel the myth that this is sexually explicit. It's explicit only in the sense that badly feigned sex in which nobody gets naked is explicit. Sure there's lots of pretend eroticism and that's the irony - the main character is supposed to let go of her inhibitions and she never can, just like the film. Even if the sex had been more explicit it would still have been a case of more is less. Everyone who thinks this film is good should go and watch 'The Red Shoes' a film made over 60 years ago which shows the real eroticism and danger of the obsessional nature of dance. It is much less direct than Black Swan and a hundred times more effective.",3,6,11,18 December 2011
Skyfall," I live in a different universe
","I usually read a few existing IMDb reviews before writing one myself and that is how I came to the conclusion that I live in a different universe to most of you. Despite Skyfall's high (8.1) rating it seems that most of the reviews posted are highly negative, not to say downright hostile. Clearly I live in a different universe and saw a different film to most of you.In the universe that I inhabit I was able to watch all the Bond movies as they came out – that's right, it may be the 50th anniversary but I'm so old I saw them all on release. In my universe there isn't a single Bond film that had a decent plot or one that made any sense or had much relationship to normal life. In fact they were distinguished by their utter lack of verisimilitude, plot cohesion and utter preposterousness. For the naysayers on this Bond film to cite lack of believability or plot holes and to complain that the villain is a camp cypher who spends precious time filling in exposition and threatening bond with some unlikely fate (sharks, teeth, laser beams anyone?) instead of putting a bullet through his head proves that they have never seen any Bond film ever shown in my universe. The absolute cornerstone of any Bond movie plot is that it is nonsensical guff that no sane person would ever believe. Even the actor who plays Bond changes every few years – how's that for lack of continuity? For dwellers in the universe I live in I wish to inform you that this is indeed probably the best Bond film ever made. There are some exciting action sequences which match anything that has been done in previous Bond films; Craig is still the definitive Bond for our time; the plot is exciting and involving though containing no more believable logic than any previous Bond film. It's stylish and well directed and the cast are uniformly excellent.What really made this film the best Bond in my estimation are the elements I suspect a lot of others didn't like. It does not go mad with CGI and often uses miniatures instead (though Craig's face superimposed on the motorbike stunt guy was clunky). It doesn't give Bond a load of unlikely gadgets and it relies on characters and the good old standbys of guns and vehicles.To complain that the plot of a Bond film was illogical or the villain ridiculous makes as much sense as complaining that Strictly Come Dancing contained elements of choreography.",8,4,13,14 November 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Does exactly what I expected it would do - best of the first 4
","I just got around to watching the RE films as I found a special offer for the first four on blu-ray for a very cheap price. I have never played any of the games, nor do I know anything about RE i.e. I am not a fanboy. Having watched all four back to back I have concluded that the ranking should be as follows (best to worst):4th (2D version – the 3D version would almost certainly render it the worst of the 4), 2nd, 3rd (Mad Max homage), 1stMy logic is that these films seem to be a basic comic book bang-crash franchise and therefore they should be judged on their ability to deliver thrills, explosions and insanely silly plots. Four does this; two is an enjoyable remix of Escape from New York; three is OK but it really is a Mad Max rip-off; one looks like it came from the video game and no-one bothered to make it look like a film.Once again I am dumbfounded by reviews which complain about the lack of logic and the many plot holes in these films about an uber-babe who fights zombies and blows things up. Go and watch a Merchant-Ivory film if those sort of things concern you.",8,4,9,29 November 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Frustrating Experience
","Utterly frustrating viewing experience. There is an excellent film in here but it's ruined by the way in which Tarantino breaks the contract with the viewer. There is absolutely no need to vandalise the viewing experience by insulting the intelligence of the viewer and by scribbling (literally) over the images on screen in a way that further implies the viewer is an idiot who could not follow a simple story without the guidance from an unseen hand.The obvious thing to do to improve this film by 100% is to get rid of the Inglorious Basterds. They are completely irrelevant to the action and the storyline. You need an American covert presence in Europe to carry the story but the basterds team in no way fulfils this requirement, rather it detracts. For one thing the whole scalping and torturing your enemy storyline makes the basterds no better than the Nazis; for another the Brad Pitt character is an embarrassment from start to finish. I do not blame Pitt for this as he is clearly playing the part as the cartoon character that was defined by the script.I'm not averse to doing things differently and I think the unexplained change to the real historical timeline and the use of contemporary music works well. The first 'chapter' is a master class in creating tension as is the sequence in the cellar. As others have commented the acting of Christoph Waltz is astonishing and quite the best thing in the film. But there are other beautiful sequences such as the opening of chapter five with its superb framing and use of the colour red. Such a pity that the rest of the film is so poorly done.Whilst I know that few will agree with me, the director Tarantino most reminds me of is Stanley Kubrick. Like Kubrick he can produce scenes of breath-taking originality but he is unable to sustain the vision over an entire film. If Tarantino could shed his sometimes infantile interjections into his own film-making process he could produce a work of true genius. Inglorious basterds is half genius, half embarrassing nonsense.",5,19,32,4 August 2010
Shakespeare in Love," A good film spoiled by anachronistic jokes
","William Shakespeare falls in love with a noblewoman, cures his writers block, hob-nobs with various Elizabethan characters like Queen Elizabeth 1 and Christopher Marlowe, introduces the first woman onto the British stage and writes one of the finest plays in the English language. All this is very enjoyable and as a love story I really enjoyed the film. I was also very impressed by the quality of most of the script. In particular there are some quite wonderful sequences which intercut scenes from Romeo and Juliet as it is performed and the interactions between the characters in the film. Many of these scenes were masterfully handled (or should that be personfully these days?). It reminded me very much of scenes from 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' so I wasn't surprised at all to see that Tom Stoppard was one of the scriptwriters. In fact I assume Stoppard was responsible for the best parts of the script though I may be wrong about that.It was odd to see both Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes playing in virtually the same costumes that they had worn in Elizabeth. Both play excellently as does Ben Affleck (making some amends for that truly dreadful Will Hunting abomination) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the object of Shakespeare's affection. Personally I found it hard to see Paltrow as Juliet but she is an excellent actress. In fact everyone in the film acts their socks off and it would be difficult to find fault with them.An excellent film based on what I've said so far then. But there are unfortunately quite significant problems with it and they reside almost entirely with the comedic aspects of the script. Throughout the film, but especially in the first third of it, there are a series of jokes that would be rejected for a Carry On film. If I tell you that one of the better comic lines is 'Follow that boat' then you will get the idea. The jokes are also anachronistic in the way that the language used in Xena, Warrior Princess is California-speak transplanted to ancient Greece. But it works in Xena because it is done to the Max. In this film it hardly ever works because the jokes are in modern parlance whilst the rest of the script is written with proper regard to the nuances of the language of the time. The fact that there are so many actors from British TV comedies is also very distracting for a British audience because you are never sure when they are supposed to be taken seriously or when they are working up to another weak joke.I have no doubt whatsoever that this film would have been improved by playing it as a straightforward historical romance and dropping the anachronistic jokes. This does not mean that funny scenes are not allowed but simply that it IS difficult to have your cake and eat it. I really enjoyed the film but the jarring switches between ancient and modern spoiled it for me and are wholly responsible for me knocking at least one star off of my rating.A nearly brilliant film spoiled by alleged comic interludes.",6,0,2,23 February 2013
Green Room," I neither knew nor cared what was happening
","So there's this punk band who get a gig at a club for white supremacists and Nazis. After one of them witnesses a murder the whole band is locked in a room and have to survive attacks from lunatics led by Patrick Stewart. There are several members of this group and sundry others who are locked in with them. One by one they are bludgeoned, hacked, disembowelled etc often more than once each.Other ex-members of the band may be joining them from time to time. This bit is unclear but there does seem to be more bludgeoned bodies than band members so I think that has to be the explanation.Rather than do something simple to cover up the initial murder, the Nazis decide to make everything worse by killing everyone and, just to be sporting, they set about this in the most inefficient way possible. Despite having the opportunity to kill everyone easily at the outset they instead opt for a series of increasingly byzantine attacks giving everyone in their gang the opportunity to do more bludgeoning etc before having their heads shot off.In the end two people and a dog survive. They may have been members of the band but by this time I neither knew nor cared. I may have missed something in the middle when I dozed off but there was still bludgeoning, faulty decision making and people who may or may not have been in the band running around the screen when I came to.You might like it if you are a fan of a good bludgeoning and hacking. If not you will come away confused as to why anyone could think the plot was believable or indeed whether the film made any sense whatsoever. (Hint: it didn't).",1,14,32,10 August 2017
Elizabeth," Good drama but with some distractions
","'Elizabeth' is a frock movie but, thinking about it, I usually only hate frock movies set later than the sixteenth century so it was quite cool for me to see this one. Long gone are the days when we used to associate Queen Elizabeth 1st with the saintly Glenda Jackson or followed that train of thought that lead inexorably to the picture of her writhing naked on the floor of a train in Ken Russell's 'The Music Lovers'. For now Glenda Jackson is just another sad member of that Stalinist revisionist party, otherwise known as New Labour and it is time for a new face to play Queen E_1.Cate Blanchett is an excellent choice for the role and in many ways she has similar facial characteristics to the young Glenda Jackson in that she can look quite beautiful in one shot but play plain or downright ugly in another. She can act too, so no problems in that department. Geoffrey Rush is excellent in the part of Walsingham as is Christopher Ecclestone as Norfolk. Elsewhere a cameo by Angus Deayton is disastrously naff and although Kathy Burke is good as Queen Mary, it is difficult to disassociate her from the character of Waynetta Slob. I'm sure that Richard Attenborough is a kindly old gent who does charitable works but I've never liked him as an actor and he has too big a part here. Using John Gielguid to play the pope was also completely unnecessary and distracting. So a mixed bag as far as casting is concerned; what about the film itself? The director Shekhar Kapur said something to the effect that he is an outsider to British culture and therefore he was looking at 16th Century England as a strange and exotic foreign land. This vision comes through very clearly in the film and is both a strength and a weakness. You get a good sense of how alien these strutting peacocks and bizarre high-ceilinged drafty buildings are to the modern mind. At times it gets rather irritating too as he seems determined to film part of every scene through gauze or knobbly glass, or else he is perversely dedicated to showing everything from a high vantage point or from the vantage point of someone lying flat on their back in a medieval gutter. Mostly it is beautiful but with sufficient gimmickry to be distracting.The story is an interesting one, with Queen E_1 being depicted as having a young lover and how, through the dirty business of becoming a politician, she loses her humanity and becomes the Virgin Queen. The central section in particular is very enjoyable but the director failed to observe one of my Rules of Modern Cinema i.e. make the film and then cut at least half an hour out of the finished product. The half hour that should go here consists of most parts of the first 20 minutes which leave you thinking they'll never get to her coronation, let alone the rest of the story, and the last 10 minutes when the transformation from warm-blooded woman to cold Virgin Queen was done far too quickly to carry conviction.As for the feminist aspects I just don't remember enough from my school history lessons to say whether they are justified. Queen E_1 is usually seen as a very strong and effective ruler and I therefore think it is believable that she really did kick ass as depicted here, at least within the constraints of what was possible for a female monarch of the time. And probably male monarchs were equally constrained. Whether she really had a lover I don't know but it does make for an interesting film.A good historical drama let down by weird visuals and weird casting decisions.",7,0,0,1 March 2013
Silent Hill," Not enough invested in the characters
","Carrie, The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Eraserhead, Salvador Dali, Tetsuo, Ring, Christian Iconography and Witchfinder General are just a few of the sources that you can see either influencing this film or being directly quoted. As in his previous film, The Brotherhood of the Wolf, Christophe Gans has tried to make a film that isn't quite like anything else you've ever seen whilst using the conventions of many different genres. In this case he has also based the entire thing on the the video game Silent Hill and tried to absorb the characteristics, or clichés, of the game genre. The result is unlikely to completely satisfy fans either of his previous film or of the games, although some of the fawning on IMDb suggests that the gamers are mostly happy with the results.I have to say that I found the film quite hard to like simply because the gore quotient was set to maximum and then some. In terms of blood, violence and general trauma to bodies human and demon this raises the bar in an already competitive field. Usually I have no objection to high gore levels although they are often used to hide underlying deficiencies in a film. In fact I don't object to the level of gore displayed here – I just find that somehow Gans (or the CGI specialists) have somehow managed to take to the fun out of it! That might sound like an odd thing to say but in the best splatter movies there is an almost unholy joy to be had in watching the slicing and dicing. Just think of those moments when you simultaneously think 'Oh no this is just too gross!' but burst out laughing because what you have seen is audacious and, yes, downright laugh out loud because you don't know what else to do with your emotions. Here the scenes are just gross and I think, on reflection, that I have this reaction because I had nothing invested in the characters. If only a little more effort had been made in the setup to make me care more about the heroine and her daughter and later some of the characters encountered in Silent Hill then I would have felt much emotional attachment and the gross-out feelings would have transferred to worrying about the characters and made them seem more acceptable. Weird or what? However, much as the experience of watching this film was unpleasant, I also have a terrific admiration for the way in which the nastiness and the kinetic energy of the game experience was conveyed so effectively. I still think that Gans has the capability of making films like no other western director – his sensibilities and eclecticism put me much more in mind of Asian martial arts or anime films than they do of anything coming out of Hollywood. It's also worth saying that some of the sequences and images really stay with you after the film. This is a rare experience in a time when the next film off the conveyor belt gives you a rush the day you see you but is forgotten the very next day when you try to remember what was so good about it. As a failure then this film is considerably better than the average movie and I look forward to Gans next film.Other things you may learn by seeing this film are a) Sean Bean cannot do a convincing American accent and b) not all little girls are capable of looking frightening by being bug-eyed and failing to comb their hair properly.",7,1,1,3 February 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," Subtle as a Brick
","I just don't get it. The 'real' world elements portrayed here make a satisfying story although somewhat obvious and lacking in subtlety. Nevertheless I could happily have watched a version of this film if it had no fantasy elements and at least had a cathartic experience based on the bad guy getting what he deserved. But the fantasy elements just did not fit here. Firstly they were strictly fantasy 101 - oh, the girl goes on the hero's journey represented by the journey into the underworld where she has to perform a series of tasks to prove her worth. Secondly they had no relationship to the real world events. Thirdly as the message was presumably that she escaped from the real horrors by fantasising, then why bother with the complex symbolism? If you want fantasy then 'Lord of the Rings' does better than this at portraying the horrors of war. If you want the real horrors of war then there are a zillion things you could watch, staring with Apocalypse Now and working down from there. I'm a big fan of fantasy and I'm a big fan of realism but this attempted combination just does not work on either count. This film will appeal to those who fancy themselves as intellectuals and like reading magical realist novels that win literary prizes. I would think that most fantasy fans, who can discern the subtext of a story in a heartbeat, and most of those who are moved by a war film can only be baffled by the praise heaped upon this entirely pedestrian film that tries to succeed by bludgeoning the viewer with the obvious. I repeat; I just don't get it.",3,12,23,19 April 2008
Doctor Strange," Near perfect interpretation but with minor problems
","This is as near to being a match to how I imagined the film should be as it's ever going to get. It isn't perfect but then nothing ever is, given that it's someone's interpretation of a work of art from a different medium. In the canon of Marvel films I rank this as number one but it's probably because Doctor Strange was always my favourite Marvel comic back in the sixties and the film captures the psychedelic aspects of the original perfectly even down to using Interstellar Overdrive on the soundtrack.My first minor dislike is that the Ancient One is played by a white woman. Actually I think that changing the Ancient One's gender is inspired and Tilda Swinton is brilliant in the role. But it's hard to see why an Asian actor wasn't chosen for the role. My other dislike was the opening sequence. It seems all films have to start with some big action sequence these days but when you don't yet know its connection to the main story it has little impact except to impress you with the CGI. I would far rather this opening sequence was left on the cutting room floor and the film started with the next scene with Stephen Strange in the hospital.Opening sequence apart, I felt that for once the CGI earned its place in Doctor Strange and was perfectly integrated into the story. The visuals often reflected Steve Ditko's style, further adding to my enjoyment of the film. I hope Marvel make some more standalone Doctor Strange movies because I can't help but feel he will be ill-served as a mere team member in one of their ensemble efforts.",9,4,8,29 October 2016
Pacific Rim," Cthulu v Transformers
","It took two sessions for me to watch this drivel. I fell asleep about half way through and had to see part two the following day.As far as I can make out this is about giant sea monsters vs transformers. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman play the gravediggers from Hamlet, badly. The two stars of Sons of Anarchy prove that they can't act their way out of a paper bag.Meanwhile Idris Elba puts in an embarrassingly bad performance ( Imagine the key speech from Gladiator written and delivered by Worzel Gummidge.) Action has been replaced by acres of CGI that might satisfy an eight year old but will fail to impress sentient beings evolved beyond the level of igneous rocks.The only redeeming feature of this film is that it is, at least, better than the pretentious and unoriginal nonsense that was Pan's Labyrinth.",1,7,9,25 May 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Worthwhile example of style over substance
","I heard the director, Paul Greengrass, being interviewed on the radio and he revealed that at lest five writers were used, including Tom Stoppard who isn't even credited. This tells you a lot. This film isn't about plot and it isn't about dialogue. The plot is a typical Hitchcockian McGuffin – i.e. it doesn't matter in the slightest. The great secret that Bourne is going to uncover isn't of the slightest interest in the end. There could have been a hundred other revelations as plausible as the one you are given. It just doesn't matter.What does matter is the chase and the whole film is just a chase and very little else. However, it is the most exciting chase you are ever likely to see in this or any other film. It starts at a cracking pace and just keeps going right to the end. The whole thing is shot using hand-held cameras as far as I can see. Occasionally this is distracting as in an early brief expositional scene where as a viewer I was distracted and taken out of the film by the shakiness of the camera as it observed two characters talking. However this was the only point at which I was distracted.Above all this film is a triumph of editing. The number of cuts are breathtaking and they are piled so deep and so quick that you can't help but be moved along by the kinetic energy on display. What might at first look like a directorial triumph is actually as much down to editing and music as anything else. The music, reminiscent of a pared-down Bernard Hermann, is surely a deliberate homage to that composer and it works brilliantly with the film to deliver an ever accelerating narrative. Bourne also makes a virtue of a stylistic device I have criticized in other reviews – the use of close shots of bodies in motion in order to give energy to a fight scene. The scene in which Bourne fights the CIA 'asset' sent to kill him is shot in a fragmentary, blurred, partial manner which succeeds brilliantly in showing the desperate violence that such a fight must surely use. I don't think I've ever seen a more brilliant depiction of a one-to-one fight shot at close range.Both a magnificent piece of film making and forgettable tosh then.",7,0,1,20 February 2013
Oblivion," Film noir as science fiction
","This film seems to be attracting a lot of criticism on the basis of similarities to other science fiction films. The references (and sometimes they are clearly deliberate) did not particularly concern me. I might have felt differently if it had been done badly but for the most part it was done well. Why should it matter? After all you don't hear many criticisms of other genres along these lines. A film wouldn't be much of a film noir if it didn't have a doomed protagonist, plot twists, cops, private eyes etc. In fact Oblivion strikes me as a good candidate for sharing the DNA of film noir and as being as good a mystery as it is a reworking of some well-known science fiction tropes.This isn't a ground breaking film and it probably won't make anyone's top ten SF films but it is certainly above average and well worth a visit to the cinema to see on a big screen. Visually it is very striking and quite beautiful to watch. The only visual aspect that disappointed me was the obvious CGI in the shots of the bike being driven over vast tracks of land or ruins (I rewatched Dark Knight Rises the other night and you can see the same problem with Catwoman driving Batman's fat-tyred bike). The CGI is otherwise as good as you will see anywhere and doesn't rely on gimmicks like 3D.The tone of this film reminds me of Solaris - Tarkovskiy's version not the snoozefest that Soderbergh directed. Tom Cruise, and we as the audience, are being invited to grapple with some interesting philosophical questions here. We can ignore them and just take this as a fun film if we like but this film encouraged me to consider some quite deep questions of identity. I've seen commentary that Oblivion is too smart for some moviegoers and too dumb for others. For me the balance between a good-looking, exciting film and something with interesting questions to ask was just right.",8,2,5,14 April 2013
Man of Steel," A whole new category of bad
","On the plus side Henry Cavill did a decent job as Superman and I liked Laurence Fishburne as Perry White.As for the rest of the cast they were either miscast or forgettable; usually both. Even Kevin Costner was wasted. Despite his sterling Jonathan Kent, the interpretation was the same as John Schneider's in Smallville. I believe Amy Adams was once in the Muppets but I think Miss Piggy would have made a better job of playing Lois Lane.Now for a few notes on the negative aspects of the movie: 1 My tip for beginning screenwriters is that it's a good idea to have a story and then to write some original dialogue. Mashing together plots from previous films and using dialogue rejected by Arnold Wesker does not count. I flatly refuse to believe Christopher Nolan had anything to do with the storyline as alleged in the credits.2 Generally supervillains who can be knocked through walls, dropped from great heights and command vast forces cannot generally be killed by breaking their necks following a battle that lasts longer than the running time of the movie. (How did they do that by the way?) 3 The visuals. Oh dear, where to start? Perhaps by noting that CGI and special effects cannot be substituted for storyline but if attempting this tricky route then the visuals had better be the best. In this film good effects have been replaced by blurry CGI, composites that are less convincing than the backgrounds painted on glass in films of the 1950s and whirly things that make no sense either visually or dramatically. I might have mentioned previously that the special effects section of the film is longer than the film itself. I believe the running time of the movie is just less than a week whilst the battle scenes go on for at least a year. (How did they do that by the way?)I'm generally a fan of superhero movies despite being in my 60s and I hate the way that 'serious' critics automatically dismiss films in this genre. I also liked what Zack Snyder did with Watchmen and 300 but this film belongs to an entirely new category of bad. Man of the Steel is the epitome of the film that might impress a ten year old boy but is incomprehensible to a sentient adult. It's that film the critics imagine to be bad by definition before it's even been viewed. It's that film your sceptical friends, who don't believe you when you say superhero movies can be good, will point to and say 'See, I told you it was all rubbish.' In this case I couldn't even begin to argue with them.",1,3,9,23 April 2014
Armageddon," The Citizen Kane of guilty pleasures
","If 1969 and the moon landings mean anything to you, if you like space hardware, if you dream of flying in the space shuttle, if you like to see things blow up frequently, if you are thrilled by backwards-ticking clocks that have to beaten before the bomb goes off, the world is doomed, there is no escape, if your love of these things is big enough to forgive a so-so script and several large plot holes that you could drive an asteroid the size of Texas through, then you'll love this film. I'm guilty on all charges.I knew this film was going to kick ass as soon as I heard the magisterial tone of Charlton Heston's voice-over at the beginning. When this was closely followed by a space shuttle being blown apart by asteroids and the destruction of large parts of an American city I was a very happy man. Even though I liked Deep Impact, this film is better – it destroys more things, more effectively in the first 10 minutes and thereafter grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the end credits.I will freely admit that one reason this film grabs my attention so much is the extensive use of the space shuttles and the excellent NASA footage and locations. It really gives an impression of what the shuttle is like, what a launch is like, how dangerous it is. Certainly liberties are taken and things speeded up such as a docking with Mir that happens so fast that in reality it would knock the station into an orbit with Saturn. There is also the slight matter of how a shuttle survives hitting several gazillion-ton asteroids but can have a whole wall blown out by a few bullets.Oh yes, the plot. Asteroid heading for Earth. Bruce Willis drills big holes for his oil company. US govt. hires Willis to dig hole and plant nuke on said asteroid. Willis recruits dirty dozen type misfits for mission. NASA training. Paranoid military types. BOOM. BANG. Backwards clocks. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler provide lurve interest.The script shows signs of being written by committee and some of the one-liners fall flat. When I introduce the law to ban trailers I will also introduce a 50 year moratorium on speeches from American presidents who say they are doing something in co-operation with the whole world whilst in reality they use one comedy Russian in the whole thing and accidentally blow up Mir in the process. I will also order directors of further Doomed Earth films to find some different national monuments to represent the other nations of the earth.Anyway, these small gripes aside, I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who, like me, enjoys brainless science fiction thrillers with loads of special effects and Bruce Willis in them. It is a sheer joy to watch and I shall be going back to see it again",9,2,4,3 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Lives up to its Dark Reputation
","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.Certainly lives up to its reputation of being darker than previous entries to the point where the whole experience of watching the film is rather depressing. However, it's a necessary part of the journey (did I really just use the 'j' word?) that Harry must take. Interestingly there seems to a greater use of London as a location and the capture and impersonation of the three ministry workers adds to the greater connection with the muggle (I hate that invented term) world. The alienation of Ron for a central portion of the film works well both as a distancing device and to better bond him with Harry and Hermione for the final battle to come. There's a very cheesy section of Harry taking Excalibur from the lake – sorry, I mean the sword of Gryffindor which again highlights how freely the series has borrowed from other sources.This was the only film in the series where I felt I was missing something having not read the books. For instance it wasn't clear to me what chasers were and most bafflingly why Dobby seemed to be such an important character after his absence from most of the films",7,1,3,1 February 2013
American Psycho," Big budget equivalent of Blair Witch Project
","I never liked Brett Easton Ellis' book and I didn't intend to go and see the film. This may seem odd for a lizard with an interest in serial murderers but I am very choosy about the killers I choose to study and the way they are presented, whether they are fictional or not. For instance I have totally lost interest in Thomas Harris and Hannibal Lector. Harris was a wonderful author and Manhunter was a wonderful film. Harris continued to be a brilliant author with 'Silence of the Lambs' but this was ruined forever, as far as I am concerned, by Anthony Hopkins hammy interpretation. I suppose Jonathan Demme has to take a lot of the blame even though I admire some of his other films. But Lambs killed Lector for me and I can't be arsed to read 'Hannibal' even though I bought it almost on the day of publication. I think only Michael Mann directing and Brian Cox as Lector could restore my faith in this franchise.The selective clips of American Psycho shown on TV and the interest of my family and friends in serial killers persuaded me to go to the multiplex. You should know right away that the film is very true to the book i.e. it is nihilistic, narcissistic and several other things beginning with n. All right-minded people and reptilians will hate it. I can confirm this because I saw it with Warrior Mouse, Princess Lizardess and a famous musician and film-score composer (no, really) who shall remain nameless. (But lets just call him Monarch of the Glen for now shall we?) To a man, woman, mouse and lizard we all thought it to be utterly tedious, boring and a complete waste of celluloid. In summary there is one joke, repeated several times, which is mildly amusing and at the expense of Phil Collins and other godawful 80s singers, an admittedly excellent performance by Christian Bale, given the pointlessness of the whole exercise, and long minutes of tedium.It was nagging away at me for some time what this film reminded me of. Then it came to me. It was obvious. American Psycho is the big budget version of The Blair Witch Project. Think about it. Both films are full of characters that are so hateful you wish they would get chopped to pieces by the psycho killer after spending five minutes with them. After 90 minutes in their presence you are prepared to wield the chainsaw yourself in order to end the torture of watching them. Both films have been hyped by their publicists and failed literary critics (i.e. film critics) as being masterpieces even though my cats have a better understanding of what makes a good film. Both films last for around 95 minutes and both films feel as though they last for 95 hours whilst you live through them. Both films feature characters who are afraid of things that normal citizens don't give a second thought to; in the case of Blair Witch, a fear of twigs, in the case of American Psycho, a fear of naff business cards or failure to get bookings at snotty restaurants that only women who want to become stick insects so they can star in more crap Hollywood products would want to eat in anyway. None of the characters in either film can tell the difference between fantasy and reality; no audience member of either film cares.",2,0,4,3 March 2013
American Beauty," Rare film that isn't 30 minutes too long
","What's it about then? Well it's about the dark underbelly of the American dream told in a mistressly fashion with top acting, directing and clever things done with cameras. As any other review will tell you Kevin Spacey lusts after his daughter's school friend, gives up his job and goes back to acting like a teenager himself. Meanwhile his materialistic wife (Annette Bening) practices her work ethics, bonks king lounge lizard and fails to understand Spacey. Equally important is the story of their daughter, her friend and psycho-boy who lives next door with his own dysfunctional family.As a piece of direction it is outstanding. The acting is both masterful and mistressful in equal proportions. It's gorgeous to look at. It's funny, sad, touching, sexy and downright brilliant. It is also, it has to be said, not half an hour too long! On this last criteria alone it should be awarded a full complement of Oscars right now. The nearest comparisons are 'Sex, Lies and Videotape' and 'Blue Velvet'; it's mammothly better than the former and comes close to being as good as the latter.Despite the dark dark currents that run through this film I found the overall effect quite uplifting and the downer of an ending made me feel very happy. I went to see this with my step-daughter and the truth of the film was enough to make that a slightly uncomfortable experience to be watching it with her which is absolutely the way it should be. Take your family to see this film if you really want to feel its effect.",8,0,2,3 March 2013
The White Ribbon," Links to Powell and Pressburger
","Although there seems to be some question as to what this film is about, the director spells it out in an interview on the blu-ray version I watched. I did not put the same interpretation on the film that he suggests but I can see it makes sense. He is also at pains to say that this isn't just about German society and could have been about anywhere with analogous conditions.I always hesitate to use the 'M' word but in this case I would call the film a masterpiece. I can also see that it isn't a film that everyone would like because it is a very still and calm film, despite the violent acts that take place. It also runs like a mystery but there are no easy answers given which might be unsatisfactory for some viewers. I generally like two sorts of film; either a straightforward good action or genre film or films that are highly metaphorical and mysterious. This is definitely in the latter category.The White Ribbon is such a beautiful visual experience that I feel it could be watched with sound and the subtitles turned off. There's so much to see in each frame and the black and white photography is better than anything I've ever seen in a film before. Oftentimes the effect is quite painterly especially when featuring the interiors of buildings. It also leaves the viewer to do a lot of the work – sometimes the characters leave the frame and shut doors behind them and the camera is static for several seconds before characters come back into frame. Could be deadly yet it's always done in a way that allows you to know what is happening behind the closed door or at least be intrigued by the possibilities. Even though the film moves at a slow pace I felt constantly on the edge of my seat.The only thing I can compare this to is Powell and Pressburger's A Canterbury Tale which had a similar set of disturbing events going on in a rural town. But the White Ribbon stands on its own as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Although I've nothing against a good bang, crash type of film as I've said, this is on an entirely different level. This is pure art and lots of people won't like it. It just so happens that I do.",10,1,7,10 July 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not the Lisbeth Salander we know and love
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is visually pleasing as you would expect from David Fincher. The music is very good if you like Trent Reznor's soundtracks, and I do. (However, the cover of Immigrant Song for the titles, not to mention the Bond visuals seemed totally inappropriate to me.) From there though it all goes downhill rapidly. Every clue you need to work out pretty much the whole solution is given in the first 24 minutes and yes, I did check. So instead of giving the audience a satisfying puzzle to solve everything is signalled and removes any tension. There are plenty of other concessions for the hard of thinking too. For instance, all the suspects' houses are visible from Henrik's house and the chief suspect's house perches atop a cliff making it look like a modern version of Frankenstein's castle.Although I like Daniel Craig's work, especially as Bond, he is wasted here and comes a poor second to Michael Nyqvist in the original film. The same is true of Rooney Mara who can't match Noomi Rapace's portrayal. All the important beats from the original film and book are mangled – Blomvkist's prison sentence is ignored, his relationship with Erika isn't explained, the dire straits that Millennium finds itself in is skated over, the importance of hacking is treated trivially, Plague isn't featured as Lisbeth's friend. And on and on it goes. Most fatally there is a failure to better explain Lisbeth's background and character. She seems like a subsidiary character in Fincher's version and she should be at least as important as Blomvkist. Often she comes over as rather weak here and the line 'Can I kill him now?' would never be uttered by Lisbeth as conceived by Stieg Larsson.I don't believe that movies should just follow the books they are based on but I do think they should keep to the spirit of the original characters. I'm always prepared to give remakes of foreign language films a chance but here, once again, it has turned out to be as pointless as I feared it would be.Stick with the original",4,6,11,26 September 2012
Dunkirk," Once I grasped it was a metaphor about events in Dunkirk
","I initially had reservations about Dunkirk. My first reservation was that the beach looked empty with only handfuls of soldiers visible. You never got the impression that there were 400000 soldiers trapped on the beach. Secondly this must be one of the most bloodless war films ever made and, whilst it's easy for directors to slip into war porn these days, men just falling over when shot is utterly unconvincing.Despite these misgivings I found the film gripping from beginning to end. The aerial scenes in particular were outstanding. The score and sound design were also outstanding ensuring that tension and was maintained and built upon throughout the film. I was also impressed by the mixing of the three timelines and points of view. Going in it seemed impossible for anyone to weave the three together but it works to perfection.Ultimately my take on the film is that Nolan has created a film that is a series of metaphors about what happened at Dunkirk and not a depiction of the reality of what happened at Dunkirk. The combination of the cinematography, score and fractured timelines give an impression of the horrors of waiting on the beach to be rescued that a more conventional approach could probably never achieve. Another director could have produced an effects heavy movie which lumbered on forever with saccharine character backstories and a linear chronology and it would not be nearly so effective.I may be wrong but I think Dunkirk is one giant metaphor. And it works",9,5,11,29 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Improvement on the first two movies
","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.I liked the first two films but I thought that this was an improvement and acted and directed with much great assurance than its predecessors. The addition of Gary Oldman and David Thewlis to the cast gave the film greater gravitas. I also liked the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Bear in mind that I haven't read the books so I'm not obsessed about everyone being portrayed as they were in the books. Richard Harris was great and it's a tragedy he died when he did but Gambon makes a more convincing head in my eyes.The look of this film certainly lifts it above the previous two. Watching all the films literally one per day over a week, the changes to the geography of Hogwart's and the School itself was very obvious but I liked the new version. The creatures and the Dementors were realised very effectively.On the downside there is yet another boring Quidditch sequence but at least the dementors livened it up. It is also clear in the latter part of the film that the title should have been 'Harry Potter goes Back to the Future' but the reworking was well done.",7,0,1,1 February 2013
The Exorcist," Has dated very badly
","The showing in Chesterfield was sold out, just like the one in Derby which I had tried to book earlier. Clearly the reputation of this film is such that it can fill cinemas even 25 years after its original release. The word on the street and in the film mags is that it is still a great film well worth the price of admission. Casting my mind back all those years to the days when I was a slim young lizard, rather than the over-stuffed Gila monster I am now , I can still recall the terror that this film instilled in me. Even though I had seen it in a matinée and emerged into a sunny afternoon I was scared. And sleeping on someone's floor in a strange house, as I did was that night, turned out to be an endurance test of sweaty fear as I started at the slightest sound or tried to close off the evil visions that would not leave my mind. Why, even Barry Norman admitted on TV last week that it was the scariest film he'd ever seen.OK. Audience reaction test first. Lots of shuffling and restlessness as the film dragged on and on. Many trips to the toilet and to replenish dwindling food supplies (they don't see popcorn in Chesterfield under normal circumstances. They can't even get eggs except in powdered form). Muttering and girlish laughter as some card jokes with his girlfriend. Then when the action eventually starts most of the audience find it funny and continue to laugh at all the scenes designed to send them into paroxysms of fear. On the way out the guy behind me is saying 'It was rubbish. F***ing rubbish.' Another guy is saying 'Fifteen years since I last came to the cinema. I shan't be coming again after that!'Me? I was mostly baffled by the fact that this was no longer a scary film. Not even in the slightest. It just doesn't work as a horror film. Where once I lost sleep over the contents of the film I now ran the danger of sleeping through the film. It was a big disappointment.In its defence I would say that it is well made and well acted, particularly by Jason Miller as the young priest. The framing and cinematography is excellent. I particularly liked the longish prologue set in Iraq and the extensive close-up work involving the main non-possessed characters. In fact the level at which it worked best for me was in the story of how the priest has to struggle to maintain his faith and how the possessed Linda Blair plays on his guilt about his mother. This is by far the most interesting aspect of the film. Otherwise it's a film that looks very dated, is poorly structured, has plot holes bigger than asteroids the size of Texas and goes on and on and on. How could we ever have been taken in by this film? It's a mystery.One question I am sure pro-censorship supporters would like us to consider, is to ask whether 'The Exorcist' is no longer frightening because we have become desensitised through watching too many horrific events on film? I think this is correct. I also think it is something about which we should be pleased. We are desensitised to the kinds of horrors portrayed in 'The Exorcist' because we all understand Linda Blair is just a young girl wearing contact lenses and gory makeup; that the demonic voices are merely the result of clever sound recording techniques; that the bed is shaking because there is a mechanical device making it do so; that defiling religious icons is a trivial act in a world full of fanaticism and people who kill for some crazy religious belief or other. We just don't care about the events portrayed in this film and why the hell should we?An interesting film that has dated very badly.",6,0,5,1 March 2013
The Butterfly Effect," In which I am impressed by an actor unknown to me
","I nearly didn't get past the first five minutes of this film. All I knew about it was that it involved time travel so I really didn't understand why the first thing you see is a paraphrased quote about chaos theory. The butterfly effect when used in conjunction with time travel is entirely different to the butterfly effect when used in chaos theory.However, I went on to enjoy this time travel fable in which the main character, Evan, keeps going back in time to try and change the future for the better. The characters were well established by showing the younger versions in extended scenes first, making them more believable. The increasing desperation of Evan as each attempt makes things worse effectively increases the tension and there are some clever devices, lighting and set dressing etc., which effectively code the different realities. You have to accept that the time travel mechanism is just magic but then every time travel portrayal relies on some bogus explanation. If that's going to hang you up then don't bother with any time travel film, ever. It's only a metaphor in any case and done more honestly here than in other films; say, The Time Traveller's Wife, for example.And just to show how hilariously out of touch I am with some aspects of modern culture I was very impressed by the acting of what I took to be a bunch of unknowns. It was only afterwards that I discovered Ashton Kutcher is apparently well known. I can therefore honestly say I was not affected by knowing anything about him beforehand. As far as I'm concerned he did a good job with this.",8,1,1,29 March 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," I was right the first time
","I had a bad experience with Lawrence of Arabia when I was a lad (the film that is, not the person). I still have vivid memories of sitting through this interminable film and over forty years later still remembered it as the distilled essence of boredom. It can't possibly be as bad as I remember, I told myself. I must have been too young to appreciate it at the time. Still somehow I never got around to trying it again.Recently I acquired a box set of David Lean films running from his first as director, In Which We Serve, through to Hobson's Choice in 1954. All the films had some restoration work done to them and they all looked good. In fact I wasn't prepared for just how good some of the films were. Of course, I was familiar with Brief Encounter and Great Expectations, both as good as ever but I wasn't prepared for just how good all the rest were. Passionate Friends is similar in some ways to Brief Encounter to my eyes a much more adult treatment of the issues than the rather soppy, though irresistible, Brief Encounter. Oliver Twist quite took my breath away with its cinematography and Robert Newton's portrayal of Bill Sykes, a singularly chilling performance which is far more disturbing than the anaemic serial killers we see in more recent films. It was all looking promising then for a reappraisal of Lawrence of Arabia. Even so the DVD sat unwatched on a shelf for several months, so bad was my memory of the original experience of seeing it. Eventually the fateful day arrived (well two days to tell the truth as I stopped at the original intermission and resumed the next day).So, was it any better than my memories suggested? Not much. At least I knew a little more about the history than I did before and could find something interesting from that point of view. But otherwise it was every bit as bombastic, boring and ennui-inducing as I had found it originally. On IMDb I see that the average score is 8.6 and it ranks at number 42 in the top 250 so someone clearly likes it. Here's why all those people are wrong: 1 The film has been praised for its cinematography, particularly the desert photography. I'll agree that there are some good shots but they aren't that great. If I want desert shots I can see much better by buying the box set of 'Life' and watching the episode on deserts. In fact I can find a dozen BBC series, usually in High Definition and usually narrated by David Attenborough which outstrip anything in Lawrence. If you like desert shots my advice would be get the documentaries instead and turn off the sound so you aren't disturbed by Attenborough droning on and on. In fact play some good desert music like Tinarewen in the background, turn the central heating up and refuse to drink water for 24 hours for a really good effect.2 The majority of the film is taken up by Lawrence seemingly crossing deserts in real time. This is both boring and pointless as a filmic experience. An alternative would be to try (1) above.3 The theme tune – you know, the one you can't get out of your head even if you try, occurs exactly when and where you think it will, usually signalling another real time trek across another bloody desert (or back again). At least you can enliven your viewing experience by predicting when the theme tune will come back in – I guarantee you'll get it right every time.4 The action scenes all run left to right (or is it right to left, I forget). There's a reason for this which I also forget but bores on IMDb can explain it to you. Despite the huge numbers of extras, camels etc employed it generates some really unimpressive battle scenes when you start to notice the left-to-rightness of the action.5 I've not read any of T.E. Lawrence's original writing but I'd be very surprised to learn he was such a crashing, pompous bore and bigot as the portrayal in this film suggests. The character in the film is so deeply unlikable as to immediately nullify my suspension of disbelief. My mind keeps interrupting my concentration as it asks how anyone can be inspired to follow this idiot.6 Many say that Peter O'Toole's portrayal is magnetic, compelling, heroic and so on in this film. I say his acting suggests that he is completely bewildered by what the character is supposed to be like so he's just settled for acting mad and unpleasant whilst staring distractedly into space.7 Goggles on a bush. How much more obvious and clichéd can you get? 8 So that's where Alec Guinness got his inspiration for Obi-Wan Kenobi? 9 Coming in at just under 47 hours in length this film is just too long. Simply taking out Omar Sharif's entrance scene would trim 24 hours from the running time. Ideally a ninety minute cut would be just about watchable.It wouldn't be cricket to not mention the good points of the film as well and they can be summarised in just two words – Claude Rains.",1,39,96,20 May 2012
It Follows," Good but not that good
","Peter Bradshaw, Danny Leigh and Claudia Winkleman are all critics whose judgements I trust and they all raved about how good this film was. As a result I was really expecting something out of the ordinary when I went to see it. However I have to say that I came out of the cinema somewhat disappointed. It's not that It Follows is a terrible film. It's actually good but it's not good enough to merit the five and ten star reviews (depending on the system used) that it's received. It's the sort of film that deserves to be discovered as a minor cult film several years after its release. I'm also puzzled by the fact so many reviewers have said it's one of the few films that they have found genuinely frightening. I wanted to be scared, I really did, but all I experienced was a minor frisson. Several things mitigated against this film working for me. There's a lot of shaky cam and it doesn't work in all films. Sometimes it does work in favour of It Follows but there are several 360 degree pans which are so out of focus as to take you out of the film. Blurring can work quite well in horror but here it would have been more effective to be in focus more often. It's the same story with the music, an electronic soundtrack that sometimes works well but at other times is just plain annoying and distracting.Homage is paid to several other films and often to the detriment of It Follows. There's a very clear reference to Halloween in the setting and the music. There's a pivotal scene set in a swimming pool at night which puts you in mind of Let the Right One In. This, above all, lets the film down. Where the pool scene in Let the Right One In is dazzlingly disorienting and genuinely frightening, the one we get here is rather pedestrian both in concept and execution.It's a pity this film has got such good reviews because it deserves to be seen as a minor horror that tries for something different and often achieves it. A more modest reception is what it really deserves. The way it plays with time so that you can never be sure when it's supposed to be set is quite brilliant and really adds to the unsettling atmosphere throughout. Often the look and feel of the film reminded me of David Lynch and I spent a lot of my time wishing Lynch had been the director because I'm sure he could make something really frightening of this material.A good film and worth seeing but my advice is to lower your expectations if you've been reading the better reviews it has been given.",6,6,28,3 March 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Another film that exceeded my expectations
","Those who like to refer to the golden age of the old Planet of the Apes movies should be forced to go back and watch them. The first one was a classic, though it's aged badly. The subsequent ones got worse and worse until they reached the point of being unwatchable. Burton's remake was marginally better but an unnecessary exercise.Because of the diminishing returns of the old Apes movies I had no intention of ever watching the Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Indeed the fact that it was promoted as a CGI-fest was enough to deter me as I believe CGI to be responsible for some of the worst excesses of modern cinema. However, it was a rainy afternoon, I had nothing better to do and I found myself watching 'Rise of..' etc., expecting I'd be bailing out within the first few minutes. To my surprise I watched it to the end and I enjoyed it.This isn't some fiendishly clever film with lots of plot twists and top notch dialogue but it is a decent version of the hero's journey, with our hero being Caesar the ape. The characters, human and simian, are well developed on the whole and there's an emotional core to the film. Thankfully it isn't an action-fest though the showdown at the end is well done. The CGI is obvious, especially when you have scenes with masses of apes, but it's acceptable in this type of movie.There's no point in whining about plot holes and believability – look, apes get intelligent and they take over the planet and you're expecting the story to be believable? Go and read a history book or two if that's what you're looking for. This film is better than I was expecting and it's a decent enough attempt to make a fun film with a few philosophical questions thrown in if you are inclined to think about them.",6,0,2,3 September 2012
Good Will Hunting," Sickly-sweet ickyness
","From reading reviews of this film I could not figure out why anyone would want to see it, so I didn't bother. As fate would have it though I happened to be on a plane when it was shown as the in-flight movie and so I got to check it out.I have to say that my view might be influenced by the awful mangling that films get before being unleashed on the flying public. Firstly, all swearwords are either removed or changed to something different, often with hilarious results. (When I saw Money Train 'mother-f*!@er' had been changed to 'mother-fouler'. I think the original was preferable, don't you?) Secondly, anything that resembles a swearword, such as 'oh dear' and 'my, my, how distressing', is removed. Thirdly, anything of a sexual nature is removed. Ultra-violence is left in and I believe the airlines have a special arrangement whereby extra scenes of violence can be inserted. Finally the colour is distorted, the sound passed fifteen times through a bucket of slime using 1920's technology and the whole thing is projected onto a screen the size of a postage stamp which is half obscured by a person in a big hat. So you have to bear in mind that these things could jaundice my views.The film, as everyone in the world knows, revolves around a young mathematical genius who works as a janitor until he is discovered by a professor and sent to a shrink. Will Hunting is played by an attractive young man who everyone raves about but whose name escapes me. Robin Williams, almost acting for the first time in his life, is the shrink who shows him tough love. An attractive young woman with an English accent whose name escapes me plays Will's girlfriend. Other characters drift in and out of the film.So this young genius gets discovered, has a few traumas along the way, teaches his prof and his shrink things they had not realised themselves and they all live happily ever after. End of film.About half way through the film I began to get interested when Will Hunting actually started to show some anger and treated his girlfriend with casual cruelty. Unfortunately this only lasted about ten seconds before we went back to everyone being nice and speaking in clichés. If only they'd let rip at this point, what a film it could have been. It could be that the airline cut out thirty minutes of dark and dangerous stuff but I don't think so somehow.Let's have a reality check here shall we? A young man grows up in poverty and is abused by his parents whilst secretly being not only a mathematical genius but also an expert on diverse other academic fields and able to wipe the floor with all comers. His other poor friends all have hearts of gold, club together to buy him a car and feel not the slightest resentment towards him. In a matter of weeks he seduces a conveniently rich young woman, solves the secrets of the universe, gets offered jobs worth zillions of dollars despite lacking formal qualifications and being fashionably anti-establishment, finds a therapist who is not him/herself dysfunctional, heals his inner child and rides off into the sunset in a glow of sickly-sweet ickyness. I don't think so.I didn't like the in-your-face manipulation of this film, directed by a dazzling young person whose name escapes me. I didn't like the clichéd and hackneyed script. I didn't like the glib solutions to really tough personal problems. This was just the American Dream in another version. We all have some hidden talent and when we decide to follow our dream we will be rich and happy beyond our wildest imaginings. The fact that we received emotional and physical traumas that would cripple the average person for this lifetime and their next fourteen reincarnations can be overcome. We can heal our lives. Hallelujah! Actually, if I saw this on late night television and I'd had a few beers I'd probably quite enjoy it. But it does not deserve the massive hype and Oscar wins that it has received. No way",3,6,10,1 March 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Another decent film that needs to have a shorter run time
","As is often the case these days there's a decent ninety minute film hidden in here somewhere. Unfortunately it's often buried under a pile of unnecessary filler and exposition gone mad. The parts of the film that could be jettisoned to make it better, tighter and more pacey are mostly in the first hour of the film and you have to wait to the later part of the film for the exciting parts. Edward Norton is completely wasted in the long rambling prologue and I really struggle to understand why the premise of the film was so difficult to set up. The programme's gone wrong and the best way to clean house is to kill everyone involved; the Bourne-alikes all have to take drugs to enhance and maintain their power but a boffin, played by Rachel Weisz, will find a solution for our new hero. Why does it take the best part of an hour to set that up and why does Weisz have to play silly screaming scientist woman before Jeremy Renner turns her into a warrior overnight? Anyway, the parkour sequence is good, though not as good as in previous excursions. The motorcycle chase through Manilla is excellent. Jeremy Renner is a much more convincing action man than ever Matt Damon was and has the capability to really lift this franchise out of the ordinary with the right script and director. In fact Renner would make an excellent Bond if ever Daniel Craig decides to hang up his guns.",6,4,7,14 August 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Stay at home and watch Daredevil instead
","We open with a battle in a forest and a castle. The action in the forest is similar to a scene in one of the early Star Wars films. The combination of live action characters, CGI and what may or may not be partially real locations looks like a very well rendered video game. In other words it looks fake and for me has the immediate effect of taking me out of the action. The CGI throughout the film is often very clunky. The mania for 3D is dying down now but it's about time that overuse of CGI went the same way. There's nothing wrong with CGI per se but when a film relies so extensively on it, you can't help but notice it.The film is nearly two and a half hours in length, though it feels a lot longer. It would have been a much better, tighter film at ninety minutes. Basically you get overlong pieces of exposition followed by some sub-Transformers crash, bang, blow stuff up scenes – again and again and again and again. The one liners that frequent this film are a Joss Whedon trademark but the rest of the dialogue seldom rises above the jokes. The plot is barely comprehensible and certainly makes little sense. It gives me no pleasure to criticise Whedon's work and I can't help but wonder how much of this film is really what he wanted to see on screen and how much of it was mandated by the studio. He's a big earner now but this is miles away from the excellent work he has done in the past. I can only hope he returns to more creative projects sometime in the near future. The work being done on the new Daredevil series by some of his former collaborators such as Doug Petrie and Drew Goddard shows how you can do justice to a Marvel superhero without compromising your principles.",1,3,8,7 May 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Fiona Shaw's Legs
","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.A trenchant commentary on the failings of the British educational system, the British press and the dystopian future that awaits us all, with a clear nod to George Orwell. (Well not so much a nod as a total reworking of 1984 with extra Harry Potter and Hogwarts).New thesps introduced in this episode include Helena Bonham Carter playing herself and Imelda Staunton channelling Margaret Thatcher. Staunton is particularly good as the hate figure appointed to run Hogwarts along Ministry lines and for whom the audience expends its mental energy on looking forward to her comeuppance.Another good entry into the series and it really does manage to get in some social commentary about the press, health and safety gone mad and Big Brother. It's nice to see Harry, Ron and Hermione now starting to take much more responsibility and teaching skills to the other students. It's a bit of a mystery why parts of London and the Ministry look as though they are back in Victorian times and why the nearest village to Hogwarts is still set in medieval times but I'll let that pass.I know I should be re-educated by the thought police but for me the highlight of this film has to be Fiona Shaw's legs",8,0,3,1 February 2013
The Artist," It's All About the Image
","I went into this film with high expectations and came out disappointed. I attended an afternoon matinée expecting to have the cinema pretty much to myself but the place was full. The audience were fairly mature so I suspect there was a special admission price. On the face of it they might have been pre-disposed to like a film that referenced older productions. There was some very low key laughter at the antics of the dog but otherwise little reaction from the audience which I took to be a reflection of a general lack of engagement.I didn't mind that the story was corny and I really really liked the music, especially when they let it rip in the dramatic sequences. But I was very disappointed with the cinematography and that's what killed it for me. The best (original) black and white films, sound or silent, have a numinous quality about them which draws you in and can make you gasp at its sheer beauty (for instance Sunset Boulevard, which the Artist borrows from, Rebecca or Lean's Oliver Twist). As someone who likes to SHOUT rather more than I do has pointed out, the film-makers seem to have achieved a rather muddy image only getting close to a good high contrast black and white look in the last few minutes! The Artist is all about the image in more ways than one. The lack of dialogue didn't bother me but I expected the black and white to be rendered much more artfully. I suspect it's also about image in the praise it has received – the critics liked it and it and as praise is heaped upon it, it becomes more difficult to dissent.The Artist isn't a bad film. It's a great idea, let down by the photography which just isn't good enough. It deserves an audience and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in watching it but it just isn't anywhere near as good as most of the critics and reviews on IMDb suggest.",6,4,11,26 January 2012
Don't Breathe," At last – a film that doesn't outstay its welcome or bombard with FX
","I seldom venture out to the theatre to see films anymore, not because I don't enjoy going but because there's seldom anything on I want to see. I'm not interested in films for children, chick flicks or films that have to go BOOM every two minutes. I used to enjoy superhero films but lately they are just an excuse for loud pointless fights and bad CGI.The only reason I went to the cinema is that my wife had friends visiting and I wanted to keep out of their way (in the nicest possible way.) Don't Breathe was the only film showing at any of the local cinemas that was remotely of interest to me. I had no great expectations but I was pleasantly surprised.This is not a big budget movie and it depends heavily on the skill of the actors to engage the audience and on the skill of the film crew to make the most of claustrophobic spaces in the house where most of the action takes place. The plot is pretty thin but serves its purpose. The score is never overpowering and the effects do not look like they needed a Cray supercomputer (do they still exist?) to render crude visuals that take you out of the action. Oh yes, and at 88 minutes you can be assured the time is used to good effect and not just to add bloat.A good efficient thriller with strong horror elements. Tense enough to keep you gripped and short enough not to let you dwell on the plot holes. Give me this any day over the tedious blockbusters that currently monopolise the cinemas.",8,1,4,17 September 2016
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Then it all went dreadfully wrong
","Some people prefer the Director's cut of Blade Runner to the original studio release and this preference is largely due to the fact that Ridley Scott removed all the naff voice-over and let the viewers fill in the not-very-difficult to figure out extra plot themselves. I therefore look forward to a future revised version of L S & 2 SBs in which the even naffer and more unnecessary voiceovers are removed. As the film opens with the spiel of a street seller, some highly contrived visuals and a setup requiring the aforementioned naff voiceovers I thought I was in for an episode of Eastenders but with lots of swearing. My heart and several other vital organs began to sink. Happily the film improved very rapidly and I came to understand why it has received such rave reviews elsewhere.The plot revolves around 4 young men who have to raise half a million to pay off a gambling debt. This requires them to rip off a gang who are ripping off a ganja factory being financed by another gang. This is interwoven with a plot concerning the theft to order of two highly valuable antique rifles by a pair of incompetent amateurs. The climactic scenes feature convoluted plot coincidences and an object lesson in Mexican stand-offs. In fact I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the writer and director had been somewhat influenced by Mutt's favourite director, Quentin Tarantino.OK, OK, I'll stop prevaricating and tell you that it is a damn good film. The visuals are great except for some odd effects which look like they belonged in a Vodka advert, the sets are suitably grimy, the script is very very funny as evidenced by a woman two seats away from me who kept distracting me with her constant cackling. The acting is wonderful. Well I say acting though I suspect that much of it is attitude rather than the result of hard thespianism. Vinnie Jones is excellent as the hard man enforcer as is Sting in his role as bar-owner and Eddy's dad . The four lads are cast to perfection as is virtually everyone else in the film. Several dimwit supports show excellent comic timing. The music is dead good too. (Let's see – constant bad language, witty dialogue, Mexican stand-off, excellent casting, cool soundtrack – are we sure director Guy Ritchie is not related to QT?).I still have a few carping reservations. I don't believe real villains in real life talk as sharply or with such biting irony as the characters in this film. Essentially this is another disguised form of the American dream despite being set in England. The four leads are all supercool dudes who we are sure are going to walk through the whole thing unscathed whilst nameless sub-villains are shot to death all around. In a sense we are being invited to imagine that this is us – we are immortal and could come through any scrape like this. Yes, I know it's a black comedy but permit me to be just a little uneasy about it. I enjoyed it a lot but I was also uneasy about the manipulation.Despite my nit-picking reservations this is still an excellent film which I urge you to go and see. If you want to consider it in terms of the fact that it is a British film then it is undoubtedly the best British film in living memory and worth a hundred 4 Weddings and Not the Full Montys.Then it all went dreadfully wrong....",8,1,2,24 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Harry Potter Virgin Speaks
","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.I've always avoided Harry Potter as what little I had heard about the books and movies did not appeal to me. The one thing that I had seen was a sequence from this first film of the Quidditch game and this was enough to put me off for all the intervening years. There are plenty of interesting theories on the origin of witches and broomsticks but kids using broomsticks to play a ball game is not one of them. This sequence was still the one I really, really disliked in the film and I groaned every time Quidditch sequences appeared in subsequent films.Two things surprised me about this film (and was borne out by the subsequent ones). Firstly they aren't about magic and witchcraft at all. In fact the nearest anyone ever gets to magic is waving a wand a speaking a couple of cod Latin words. Secondly they are primarily about life in a boarding school and perhaps should have been called 'Harry of the Second Remove and his Magic Wand' or perhaps 'Hermione of the Sixth and her  ' (On second thoughts let's not go there).None of these comments mean that I did not like the film nor that I thought it was bad. On the contrary, once I got past my preconceptions, I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent family film. It worked brilliantly on the level of Harry's ill treatment at the hands of his adoptive parents, his integration into the school and the beginning of the introduction of the external threats to his world. It was well directed, funny and always engaging.The young cast did well although they clearly had a long way to go. Daniel Radcliffe sometimes looked as though he had been well tutored in the art of pulling particular faces to express different emotions though his eyes didn't always show he had internalised them. Rupert Grint was probably the best of the young actors. The adult actors were uniformly good and the decision to work only with British thesps was clearly the right one.",7,0,0,1 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Best film of series
","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.At the time of writing I have now watched the whole series of Harry Potter films in a single week and this is probably my favourite because it seems to have more flair and more fun than the rest. The tri-wizard contest which is the heart of this film gives a good structure to the story and the opportunity for a series of exciting set pieces. The introduction of teams from the wonderfully named Beauxbaton and Durmstrang schools adds more colour and a great sense of the absurd.It doesn't start well however. Very early on we find ourselves at the Quidditch World Cup and my heart sinks at the thought of more broomsticks and balls. Thankfully though, the dark forces share my view that Quidditch is an insufferable bore and just a rugby match by proxy and send dementors to punish and kill participants. The battle with the dragon which becomes the first task of the tri-wizard tournament gives us a real arena for aerial combat and reinforces the pointlessness of Quidditch.There's a bit of a dip near the end with an attack of killer hedges reminiscent of the end of the Shining but the revival of Voldemort and subsequent battle livens things up. (Think, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave followed by a light sabre battle from Star Wars).It's difficult not to make fun of how the Harry Potter films cannibalise lots of other films and books but this is a great film to watch especially if you don't take it too seriously.",8,0,1,1 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Fun but derivative
","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the moviesÂ…. The second film in the series was as competently done as the first one though perhaps a little on the long side. The acting from the young leads improved and additions to the adult cast were welcome. It's hard not to be swept up by Robbie Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid and I was impressed by Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw who are convincingly awful and bring great comic timing to their parts. I was underwhelmed by the big set pieces at the end which followed a standard quest where the hero has to overcome certain obstacles to win through. Nothing wrong with that except that there are elements of Raiders here and the use of underground perils you've seen in a thousand other films but with more CGI. Speaking of CGI I noted that the CGI character, Dobby, was nowhere near as annoying as the over-the-top portrayal of Gollum in Lord of the Rings (I'm still convinced that Andy Sirkis would have made a better Gollum without the use of GGI but that's another story). There's another boring Quidditch sequence and lots of unconvincing use of magic (wave the wand and mumble something vaguely Latin) but otherwise another sound and enjoyable film",6,0,0,1 February 2013
Centurion," More for Less
","I like a good 'historical' film and I'm not picky about whether it's historically accurate or not. (It never is, it's about entertainment and storytelling. Get over it.) So I like Centurion even though it has faults and is bloated and overlong but this impressed me so much more especially bearing in mind Ridley Scott's budget was at least a hundred times more than the one for Centurion. In fact Scott has got really flabby with his work recently - I hated Robin Hood with a vengeance. My suspicion is that Marshall is driven to produce more for less because of budgetary constraints.I did have difficulty sympathising with the Romans in this film because every instinct I have is fully behind the Picts. Yes we make a joke about 'what have the Romans ever done for us?' but in my case I really hate the Romans. I guess it's part of my racial heritage. Nevertheless the actors do a really good job of appearing to be decent guys and they do win you over, sort of.Cinematography and the score are both excellent too and deserve a mention. This isn't your typical big budget action film made for a zillion bucks in Hollywood. It was made relatively cheaply in the UK and it's all the better for it. (Not something you'll hear me say often as I generally hate modern British films and glad to see the back of the Film Council. In this case though it was taxpayer's money well spent!)",Null,1,3,30 April 2011
Prometheus," Excellent film hidden inside a really dreadful one
","Watching Prometheus is a frustrating experience. This is mainly because there is a very good film which has been folded inside an exceedingly bad film. I can't make head nor tail of Ridley Scott's pronouncements about this not being an Alien film but happening in a parallel universe. This is without a doubt an Alien film so why pretend otherwise?Let me talk about the good film. At its best this is a great monster movie with lots of action and scares. It delivers on the monsters and it delivers on the hardware. Even the CGI is excellent for once. The cast is just about perfect. I have my reservations about Noomi Rapace but she is pretty good as the Ripley-alike. Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are all outstanding and the supporting cast is equally good. It is (the good part) a worthy addition to the Alien mythology and Ridley Scott proves he can still deliver the goods after a long run of mostly forgettable films. This is clearly set up to allow for a sequel too, though I can't imagine Scott doing it. Could James Cameron be tempted?Except it's all wrapped up in some embarrassingly lame plot about the meaning of life and who made us. Worse, it's tied to an utterly awful story clearly derived from Eric Van Daniken; God was a Spaceman; cave paintings prove it etc., etc. The dialogue is just about the worst I've ever heard in a blockbuster movie and that's really saying something.There's a clear and compelling way to improve Prometheus that would make a killer director's cut. First, cut out all the drivel that happens in the opening act and start with everyone already on board the Prometheus. Remove all the 'God was a Spaceman' references and insert some short scenes giving a more believable motivation for the expedition. How about – we've seen some weird anomaly in a far galaxy, let's go and investigate and see if we can find new bio-weapons for the company? Remove naff dialogue where characters discuss their beliefs. Turn up the background sounds so you can't hear the worst of the remaining dialogue. You'd be left with a 90 minute film worthy of the Alien franchise and we could all believe in Ridley Scott once again.",7,8,17,1 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Verisimilitude
","I know it's a bit of a pretentious title but it sums up for me what I felt about the film.For those who thought it was unrealistic or had plot holes, I say watch the opening plane hijacking scene and tell me what's realistic about that. In case you hadn't noticed it's a superhero movie. What did you expect? For those who thought Bane should have been three inches taller and not have changed his nationality, I say it's a film not a faithful rendition of the original.I picked verisimilitude as my watchword here because, whatever its faults, TDKR seemed true to me. I managed to avoid reading anything much about the film before seeing it but as soon as the character Blake appeared I understood who he was going to turn out to be. Everything the characters did in this film seemed to be absolutely in tune with my conception of the Batman. I believed every one of them and they never did anything out of character as far as I conceived of their personalities and behaviour. It's absurd because I'm just talking about fictional movie characters based on fictional comic book characters, doing things that are physically impossible and yet they seem true.And yes there are things that were annoying such as the Darth Vader resemblance caused by Bane's mask and the strange compression or expansion of time that so many have mentioned. But these problems are far outweighed by the look, the sound, the pace and above all the emotional involvement that this film supplies.The best assessment I've seen from a critic is that broadcast by Mark Kermode on Radio 5 Live. He describes what he really, really wanted to see from Tim Burton's original Batman movie and how the film fell short. This was the Batman film he always wanted to see and it was the one I always wanted to see too.",10,6,16,1 August 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Watching all Potter movies in a single week
","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies. One week later I was done.Lived up to my prediction that a previously dead major character is still able to appear and give advice. Compounded this by allowing a major major character to die and yet not really be dead.However, this was a satisfying end to the series and delivered enough in the way of battle scenes to be exciting. Some characters even died for real though mostly they had the good taste to do this off screen.I could have done without the 'nineteen years later' epilogue which just suggests it's all going to happen again with a new generation.Despite my sometimes cynical and snide remarks about the whole Harry Potter series of films I did find them very enjoyable. They always seemed to be made with good intent and delivered a good mix of content and some subtext to be satisfying to both younger viewers and adults. I didn't have the burden of having read any of the books so couldn't find an axe to grind in that respect.By the end of January 2013 I had seen all the Harry Potter films in a single week. In February 2013 I had purchased the full set of books from ebay and began reading.",7,0,1,1 February 2013
The Truman Show," OK but nothing startling
","Like everyone else says, it's dead good. Jim Carey shows that he can actually act. Ed Harris shows that his acting is entering the superclass league. The script is grand. All the supporting actors give sterling performances. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll talk about it afterwards. And yet I can't help feeling it's not quite the five-star smash that all the other reviewers say it is. It's derivative (Stepford Wives, It's a Wonderful Life (the town), 1984, Philip Glass (even though he didn't write the music)), it has plot holes the size of Texas, it has a happy ending that struck me as more likely to be the result of voting by brainless preview audiences than the author's intent. But why carp? It's better than the average Hollywood film for sure and well worth the admission price.I think it's something to do with the things in which you've been immersed for a lifetime. The average film critic falls over in amazement when she discovers something that is not European and not utterly brainless because she has been raised on a vapid, soulless, utterly boring diet of literature and film based around the emptiness of family drama, where middle-class comment passes for politics and consideration of real intellectual ideas is anathema. On the other hand, the average spotty youth or youthess who has even glanced at the only true literature of the 20th century (I mean science fiction of course) or considered the history of philosophy, even at the amoebic level of 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance', will see The Truman Show and cry out 'Yeah, very pretty but tell us something new.'So, my advice to you is see the film. If an idea has ever crossed your brain you will probably enjoy it though be puzzled at what all the fuss is about. If you are a film critic for the 'quality' press you'll think it's the second coming.",6,0,1,21 February 2013
The Matrix," Film assumes you are an idiot but excellent action
","One minute I was sitting in front of my PC flying a dragon across a mist strewn landscape, the next minute I found myself sitting in the UCI Cinema. Whoa! (I thought). What's happening dude? It seems I was watching a film called 'The Matrix' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and the very toothsome Carrie-Anne Moss. Apparently human experience is just a Virtual Reality created by weird AI beings to lull us into compliance and enable them to harvest us for our bio-energetic essence. I thought everyone knew that by now? Well, apparently not according to this film.In fact there are many, many things that this film believes the audience does not know. For a start it believes we do not know that AI machines will take over the world because we are so stupid. It believes that we know nothing about the history of Western philosophy and even less about Eastern philosophy. It is not aware of the fact that most of us have spent hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours in our lives discussing the nature of reality both sober and (more frequently) drunk and that we are intimately familiar with all the arguments involved. The film does not know that we can recognise a cliché-ridden script when we hear one. (Sample: 'My way or the highway.' Someone is pulling our virtual legs here surely?)This film does not know how restless a modern audience can get waiting for the action to start nor has it ever heard of the Lizard's First Law of the Cinema i.e. First make your film then cut at least thirty minutes out of it because it is just annoying dreck that has been put in to pad out the film because all film directors are too chicken to make films that run 90 minutes these days, pal! Suddenly I hear Keanu's voice in my mind – 'I know Kung Fu!' I find myself in a sparse Japanese Hall. Keanu makes several hypnotic gestures culminating in a flick of the wrist beckoning me to fight him if I dare. I realise that he is imitating Bruce Lee's postures and damn me he nearly succeeds. I step swiftly aside and Laurence Fishburne steps in to take my place. Even though my Real Life mind knows Keanu and Larry don't know anything about Kung Fu, my VR mind believes they are old hands at it. As a long time fan of HK Action films I find this sequence absolutely exhilarating. What Keanu and Larry lack in terms of authenticity is easily hidden by the choreography, editing and special effects.Then, in the blink of an eye, I'm cowering behind a pillar as a dozen men and one woman with an armoury of guns blast hell out of the marble-clad walls, floors and ceilings of a huge office lobby. Remarkably a thousand wall tiles die for every person killed but in due course and in suitable John Woo style, the good guys win only to go on to the next action-packed scene.Taking the action scenes and the effects alone this is one of the best films I have seen for some time. When they really let rip with the guns, bullets, machines, kung-fu and upside-down, sideways and backwards balletics I felt a real adrenaline rush of joy of the kind denied to all those po-faced critics in the broadsheets who have to seek meaning and purpose and socially responsible messages in modern films.But then suddenly I was back in plotland with all the lack of logicality you'd expect from one of the worse technobabble episodes of the least good Star Trek franchise show scrapped from the bottom of the barrel when they are running out of money and ideas at the end of a long run. Bought back down to reality with a bang.Forget the plot. Go for the action and the effects. And one more thing – Existenz has this film beat hands down. The two films have very similar questions to ask about the nature of reality. Existenz treats you as though you are an intelligent human being and never ever lets you guess which reality is real. The Matrix assumes you are just a dumb puppy that only wants to be amused for the moment.",7,2,4,24 February 2013
Looper," Bruce Willis is in it - what could possibly go wrong?
","Absolutely not what I expected and all the better for it. All the comparisons with Blade Runner, Star Wars etc make no sense at all. I went in expecting lots of CGI, vehicle chases and so and thankfully I got only a modicum of each. No one whacked me over the head with a set piece that was so loud and filmed so close up and in blur-o-vision that it made no sense whatsoever. No one told me there was a 3D version and I had to see that. No one told me I had to see three and a half prequels to fully understand it.Instead I got a good old-fashioned film with a story, dialogue and not everything explained to me in scene one for fear that I might be an idiot. That is not to say that the story itself, the science or the time travel made any sense whatsoever. You just have to go with it. If you can't buy it then don't bother going. We all think we know how time travel works, paradoxes, altering a tiny bit of the past changing a huge chunk of the future blah, blah, blah. In truth we don't know – half of what we know we've learned from other books and films and the other half is based on our limited understanding of physics. I'm pretty sure the 'science' in this film is wrong but your guess is as good as mine. I like the approach which says – we really don't know so we'll do it this way and not worry about complex explanations.It's not going to change your life and I really don't believe you'll be remembering this 20 years in the future like you remember the old classics like Blade Runner. (Unless and until the studios find a way travelling back in time and changing your memories of what you saw – they could wipe out all the classics and just leave you thinking their usual product was genius. I digress, but I do have an idea for a screenplay!) It's fun and you'll probably enjoy it unless you are a physics maven or unless your expectation of the ratio of explosions to story have been irretrievably warped by recent films",8,0,10,2 October 2012
Jackie Brown," Good Tarantino but film belongs to Pam Grier
","The things you need to know are; that SLJ sells guns and Pam Grier, who plays Jackie Brown, works as a flight attendant for a crummy airline but smuggles money out of Mexico for SLJ. Jackie Brown is braced by the feds who are after SLJ just when SLJ decides he wants his entire half million stash bringing out of Mexico. Thrown into the mix are Robert De Niro as a very dim sidekick to SLJ, Bridget Fonda as one of SLJ's girlfriends and Robert Forster as a bail bondsman who falls for Grier. The scene is then set for a complex plot in which you are never entirely sure who is going to double-cross whom right up to the very last few scenes of the film.This is a very conventional film in many ways. It is heavily plot-driven in a way that sustains tension throughout. The characters are given plenty of opportunity to develop and to surprise the audience. There are laughs and a few in-jokes. The camera movements are, for the most part, very constrained and the use of close-ups is extensive. Only twice does Tarantino do anything out of the ordinary; once where he uses a short split-screen sequence and once where he shows the same scene three times from three different perspectives. But you feel that this is not the director showing off but sensible decision taking about how the plot can best be served. The violence is nearly all off screen and the only thing your maiden aunt could object to is the language. And what language it is. It seems like Tarantino has a perfect ear for putting just exactly the words you would expect into his character's mouths. We all know no one is as fluent, as funny or as dumb in real life but, whilst we are in the cinema, we believe that real people could speak this way. It seems like there are acres and acres of dialogue in Tarantino's films but they are all worth hearing.At the heart of the film though is Pam Grier as Jackie Brown. It's not as if she comes over as being a great actress but she does come across as being a real woman. She's got a serious choice to make if she is ever going to get out of being a flight attendant and she is streetwise enough to be plausible as the woman who will risk it all to rip off the half million and still win your sympathy. She is also in her forties, big by comparison with what is fashionable, and more gorgeous than any teen or twenties stick-insect actress that you could ever mention. Clearly, either Tarantino or the cameraperson, or both, are deeply in love with Pam Grier as is evidenced by the many long and lingering shots of her. Some of these shots go on for so long that there can be no reason to hold them for the sake of advancing the film. They are simply there to let us look at her and read every nuance in her face. If you don't like her face then some of this film will leave you cold. And this leads to my only criticism of the film in that it could comfortably be 20 to 30 minutes shorter – not necessarily cutting the shots of Pam Grier but elsewhere where things run on just a shade too long.",7,0,1,24 February 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," You Probably Won't Like it but I did
","When I like a film I always spend some time on IMDb reading the 'hated it' reviews and I'm constantly surprised by what I read. Obviously, a lot of people really hated this one and, whilst I might not take a lot of these seriously as they are little more than rants and SHOUTING, others have a more considered take on the film's shortcomings.I'm a fan of Joss Whedon's work so I'm predisposed to like what he does (yes I know he was only co-writer and not the director). The dialogue and sensibilities though are clearly Whedonesque in character and some of the actors previously cast in Angel and Dollhouse are prominent in the cast. There's no doubt this is a meta-film and whilst I started off thinking this was an elitist approach that is bound to alienate many, it is actually true about any great movie or work of art that it is about the state of the media in which its realised.Many of the references made in this film assume a familiarity with the horror genre, not just of horror films themselves but of literary references that have influenced horror. I would be surprised if most fans of the genre did not enjoy this on some level but the reviews here sometimes say otherwise. I will observe the convention that most other reviews have observed in not commenting on the developments that feature in the second part of the movie although I will say that I do not think the parallels with the Truman Show that some have drawn are really relevant. (Because nowhere is it implied or stated that there is an audience beyond the technicians).In the past I have often commented on poor CGI in films and this one has some quite dodgy CGI sequences but in this case I didn't mind. They are over so quickly and in some cases are so cheesy that I just treated them as part of the fun.I really, really liked Cabin in the Woods but you probably won't.",9,2,11,20 April 2012
Windtalkers," Opportunity Missed by Several Miles
","Extended advert for John Woo's ability to direct (or not) war action. Nicolas Cage at his bombastic worst. Vestigial story about Navajo code talkers and native American mysticism grafted on as afterthought. Left the room for fifteen minutes at one point to go to toilet check email etc. On my return everyone was still shooting everyone else somewhere or other connected with WW2 and story had not advanced.  John Woo can direct action, Nic Cage can act and war films with high gore level and ear-splitting sound effects can be effective but none of these statements apply to Windtalkers.I look forward to the day someone makes a decent film about the Navajo code talkers, a story that deserves much better treatment than this.",1,0,1,10 April 2011
Braveheart," Works because it is done with conviction
","Mel Gibson plays William Wallace and the story basically tells how he is politicised, raises an army and begins to win against the English, even pushing back their forces as far as York. But in the end he is unable to get the support he needs from the Scottish nobility and his revolt falls apart. Wallace is hung drawn and quartered after his capture but, of course, the idea of freedom lives on.Gibson is very good in the part and plays with utter conviction. My only reservation here was that he leaves his highland village aged about ten and returns aged forty although you would expect him to be in his twenties. He remains looking forty for the remaining years of his life too. But it is difficult to get around the fact that in showing someone's life you have to use different actors â€“ if you have too many it gets confusing. I'm no expert but his accent sounds pretty good to me too.The casting is convincing throughout especially with the grizzled and weathered warriors who always mange to look as they really know how to handle themselves. Special mention must go to Patrick McGoohan who is perfect as Edward Longshanks. The cold and calculating way in which he manipulates everyone around him is played to the maximum and you believe that this man could really dominate his family and his court through sheer force of will.Gibson also directs and it is difficult to find fault in this. The battle scenes are some of the best ever seen on screen though I do not know how much of this is down to the second unit direction rather than Gibson. Whatever, it is impressive.As a viewing experience I do feel the third act is a little disappointing as the rebel camp falls apart and Wallace is betrayed and captured and this section could have been trimmed down a little. But that's just a minor point. Some people have noticed historical inaccuracies and moaned about them. For instance Prince Edward's French wife was apparently only about six years old at the time she is portrayed as an adult having it off with Mel in the film. Well, it's a good sub-plot in the film so it doesn't trouble me at all.The other glaring inaccuracy is the fact that Wallace's warriors wear woad into battle although this practice died out long before. To this charge I'd like to say I just don't care. When you see the warriors woaded up you just know that this is right. Even if woad was not used at the time it should have been! Painting your face to make yourself look fierce in battle has always been practiced and always will. Whether it is woad or mud or red paint that is used it is psychologically right. The woad is one of the masterstrokes of the film for me",8,2,5,3 March 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Having Your Cake and Eating it Too
","I’ve never read the book on which this is based but my main reaction to the film was that it would have been vastly improved by removing all the sections based around Millionaire and just telling the story straight. Oh, that and all the main characters should have died in a hail of bullets in the final scene. It just doesn’t work as a film in any coherent way. I imagine the meeting where the film is first pitched – “It’s about the poverty of Indian children who live in the slums and how they have miserable and exploited lives – no wait, the high concept is that we can make it a feelgood movie with a happy ending and some Bollywood music and dance.” In the end we have film in which the poverty and misery is made to look chic by the way it’s shot and musically scored underpinned by all the usual Hollywood clichés. The result is something that people who really don’t care about movies can think is arty and of course it’s perfect Oscar fodder. It’s exotic, it’s abroad, it’s a bit harrowing but not too much, it has a happy ending. (Goodness knows what kind of sheltered lives some of the critics on IMDb have led if they think the violence and poverty shown here is too horrific for their weak constitutions. The problem is that it’s not real enough). I like fantasy. I like realism. On the whole I don’t think they mix well. (Pan’s Labyrinth being another example where the mixture really doesn’t work.) Danny Boyle has tried to have his cake and eat it too. It obviously worked at the box office but it didn’t work for me.",3,5,6,28 February 2010
Gladiator," Good, but not for the expected reasons
","If you look on my top shelf of DVDs and Blu-Rays you will find pride of place given to 'Spartacus', 'Ben Hur' and 'El Cid'. I have told the story elsewhere about how bizarre English educational policies permanently altered my brain chemistry so that I became fetishistically fixated on sword and sandal epics and how death by being disembowelled by the sword became linked with stories of baby Jesus in a satanic miasma of adolescent confusion. In short, I like a good epic. I had therefore been looking forward to seeing 'Gladiator' ever since I first heard about it. The question is, then, was it worth the wait? Short answer – no. Long answer follows.I liked Gladiator a lot though it took me half the film to readjust my head to what I was seeing as opposed to what I had expected to see. I would not call this film an epic and it certainly does not compare to the spectacles we used to see in the good old epics as mentioned above. Instead we get a classic Joseph Campbell-like heroes journey story in which Russell Crowe starts out holding high position as a commander of the Roman Army in the North but is betrayed, left for dead and has to fight his way back from the bottom in order to wreak the revenge of the righteous man. On this level it works superbly. Russell Crowe is the man. There can be no doubt after seeing this film that the mantle of romantic tough guy lead must pass to him for the foreseeable future. I would not say that he is a great actor (thank god) but he has the looks and the presence to make the character work. A pivotal scene in which he reveals his identity to Commodus, his nemesis, is simply fantastic.So we end up with a film that has a very strong emotional centre. The murdered emperor Marcus Aurelius is a highly moral man who wants to pass responsibility to Crowe, not to his real son. We see the struggles that Crowe has to go through to accept the responsibility and then how, even when he becomes a slave and his family is murdered, he can still eventually do the right thing. I would guess that it is because this emotional tale is so central, rather than the fighting, that Scott has chosen to shoot so many scenes by using close-ups of the actors and that they occupy so much time on screen. In fact I think this will transfer very badly to a pan and scan TV version because he often uses close-ups with 2 heads either side of the screen with an out-of-focus centre. Nice to see a director really directing for widescreen (at least on this level).But as for the much-touted gladiatorial scenes I have to say that I was disappointed. In the first instance the CGI is still not up to the job. We all know only a portion of the Coliseum set actually existed and the rest was computer generated. It's good but it's still not good enough. The flyover shot of the arena which has been much talked about is also good but still not good enough to make you forget you are watching a computer-generated scene in which the movements of people and animals is still too jerky to be convincing. Compared to the epics of the 50s these modern CGI scenes are not as impressive as large-scale sets.I have to report disappointment over the actual combat too. Compare the opening, admittedly very good, battle with any battle scene from Braveheart and you will see that it is not quite as good. The man to man fighting between gladiators later in the film is even more disappointing with Scott constantly going for close-ups rather than pulling back to let us really see the action. Bruce Lee and Fred Astaire both looked brilliant because they were usually (almost always with Astaire) shot with their full bodies in frame. What made them so impressive was that you could see they used their whole bodies and most of what they were doing was not faked. In Gladiator I seldom escaped the frustrating feeling that tight camera angles were being used to compensate for the fact that the real spectacle was too difficult to depict. Oh and I have to say that men wrestling stuffed animals still looks as silly as it ever did.I regret saying so many negative things here but I say them because the film seems to have been hyped as something it is not. It is superficially an epic but it in no way compares to the best of the original epics. In my judgement this is a film about character and the relationships between men of honour and men of opportunity. The acting from Richard Harris is as impressive as that from Crowe. Oliver Reed also turns in a good performance for his last film and we can only regret that he did not get better roles in his life. Perhaps Reed's tragedy was that he would have been perfect for epic roles as a young man but epics had become too expensive to make by then.Ridley Scott is still, to my mind, one of the best and most innovative directors around and I rate this film highly despite my criticisms. The problem lies in the marketing. This is an excellent film but for every reason other than the ones advertised.",7,0,0,1 March 2013
Alien: Covenant," An improvement but same faults as Prometheus
","On reviewing Prometheus in 2012 I said it 'is a very good film which has been folded inside an exceedingly bad film.' I could say exactly the same about Covenant. In fact this Alien prequel suffers from almost exactly the same faults as Prometheus. It's overlong, has too much mystical mumbo-jumbo that adds nothing to the plot and the dialogue is awful.Without giving anything away you could immediately improve the film by cutting out the prologue, the flute scene and at least half of what happens on the planet. I have nothing against philosophical musings in films but that's not we expect in an Alien movie. We want the visceral and pulse-pounding moments building up to a crescendo without any baggage to slow down the action.Ridley Scott has said he wants to build a franchise out of Alien to rival Star Wars. I believe he could do it if he'd ditch all the nonsense and find some better scripts. I really enjoyed Alien: Covenant for the most part but I'm really frustrated by the bits that apply the brakes when we want the action to keep building.",6,4,13,13 May 2017
Law Abiding Citizen," Absolutely logical so long as you don't expect everyday logic
","If it was from the Marvel stable then everyone would get it. This is a comic book movie from beginning to end. It makes no sense whatsoever to treat this as a believable story that follows the logic of everyday life. Nor is it reasonable to expect a resolution that does anything more than come to an end with a big bang and an easy resolution.But why is everyone griping about the ending? It makes complete sense in the comic book mentality of such things. If you want to see a message or meaning then the whole thing does make logical sense from beginning to end. You can see the killings coming from miles away when it gets going – the phone, the exploding cars etc. but the logic of the piece is that Butler is trying to teach Foxx a lesson, not that he is getting revenge (something he explicitly denies in the film). Foxx's character only learns the lesson in the last few minutes of the film and does the only thing it makes sense to do. Of course there's no moral lesson about the wrongs of killing to achieve justice – Butler is the superhero character, Foxx is the villain but in the end it's more important that he comes around to Butler's viewpoint than it is adhere to his villainous principles.Having said all that though I do agree that the recital scene at the end should have terminated in a loud and bloody explosion – now that would still have made sense and given closure to all those who thought the ending let it down.",7,1,2,20 May 2012
