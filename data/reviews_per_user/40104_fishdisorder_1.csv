Iron Man 3," 'm loving it
","I found Iron man 3 very entertaining. I had high assumptions regarding the movie, but I ended up enjoying it even more than I knew to expect.I think the movie was better than its prequels in many ways. It was full of events, the tension in many parts was exceedingly thrilling and the plot went on fluently. The new characters suited the plot perfectly and I found it really hard not to love them. The movie also gave us a change to get to know the old characters more deeply. As for Tony, it was amazing how the movie brought up so many of his sides, the humorous, sarcastic and smug part, but also the other, more deep side of him. I have never liked Pepper as much as I do now, and the movie served Happy and Rhodey as well.The movie was also visually beautiful and the effects were stunning. I give credit to the brilliant visual development, too. The explosions, battles and other scenes alike were realistic and exciting.Altogether, Iron Man 3 was an amazing experience, and I highly recommend watching it, were you a fan of Marvel or not!",10,3,13,1 May 2013
