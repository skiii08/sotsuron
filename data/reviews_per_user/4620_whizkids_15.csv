Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," He is the chosen one. He will bring balance *spoilers*
","OK, this is set before the first Star Wars movie came out. It starts out with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master, Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (one of my favorite Jedi's. If only they had given him a blue lightsaber.....). It ends up with the beginning of the Separatist movement that brings about the empire for the original Star Wars Trilogy. It also introduces Anakin Skywalker (last name sound familiar?), the prophesied chosen one of the Force, who will bring balance to the galaxy. We also find out how C-3PO was made, what R2-D2's original career was. We also get to see the Homeworld of Coruscant( sounds like that french pastry) and also the original Jedi Council members. The title 'Phantom Menace' refers to the Sith, who were long believed to be extinct, but the Lord of the Sith survived the wars of long ago, and has been secretly dispatching his apprentice, Darth Maul (the second most famous Dark Force lightsaber wielder) to go do different tasks for him.This movie is very good. The only downside is some bad acting. A lot of it is really good, but you just have to watch it to see who really kills it.Very good, the most violent scene is the last lightsaber duel (it ends up with Qui-Gon getting killed and Darth Maul getting split in half), and , although the Force is still a problem, it's another thing where Christians can draw enough to tolerate it. In any case, it's very good.",8,1,2,25 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The Dead Man's Chest is still second to the Black Pearl.
","First, let me say that I really, really wanted to like this movie to the fullest. I felt that the first movie was over-hyped, but good. This one is also good, but over-hyped beyond comprehension.Will and Elizabeth are finally facing the consequences for their actions at the end of the first film. The punishment? Death. There is a chance that one of them can receive a pardon (it's never made clear which one exactly would actually get it) if Will brings to the new leader of the East India Trading Company, Lord Beckett, the compass that belongs to Captain Jack Sparrow.Jack meanwhile, is trying to find the key to the Dead Man's Chest when he gets an unexpected (and rather creepy) visit from Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's father. He informs Jack that the deal he made with Davey Jones thirteen years ago to raise the Black Pearl from the depths of the ocean and make him captain of it has reached its limit. His soul now belongs to Davey Jones, or else he must suffer the wrath of the Krakken. He rushes toward land, any land. Which happens to be Cannibal Island. There's a bit of a ruckus, but in the end Will has found Jack, Jack takes him to Tia Dalma (a voodoo priestess) who informs them of the importance of the Dead Man's Chest and where they can find the key to unlock it, revealing an item that might just save Jack's soul. There's much more to the plot, but it would take too long to give even a brief description of it. Long story short, Will gets the key from Davey Jones, and gets to meet his father. Norrington has had his life destroyed due to Jack Sparrow, and Elizabeth is torn inside trying to decide between Jack and Will. All this while everyone is trying to get the Dead Man's Chest and the treasure within.This can get very confusing. The plot is a mish-mash that could have been split into another two movies. The action is what carries the weight here, and it does get very exciting (and half the time it's also very humorous). Jokes from the first film are used again, but it seems more in line of continuity then lack of originality.The big problems with this one include some slow pacing (we really didn't need the whole Cannibal Island sequence), some rather violent images (sometimes this felt like a sailor's horror movie), and the general darker tone to this compared to the first film. It's just not quite as fun.If you're a good ol' rumrunner that is looking for adventure on the high seas fighting against the paranormal of the briny deep aided by astonishing visual effects and can follow many, many plot lines woven (loosely) into one that feels like it relies on two big names and tremendous action sequences to be a success, then this is a movie for you. If, however, you prefer a story that focuses more on characters, is easier to follow and has a more upbeat tone to it, I recommend you sail for different waters. Savvy?",7,0,2,20 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Aslan is definitely on the move.
","OK, this review is going to be based on a Christian perspective, so if you don't like what I'm saying, I do apologize in advance if I offend you.OK, a witch, magic potion, spells that can cause long winters and turn beings into stone, mythical creatures such as satyrs, minotaurs, centaurs, griffins and the like along with a boatload of talking animals. What could possibly separate this from such occult movies like Harry Potter? One word, Aslan.The movie starts out in the 1940's, with the bombings over London happening. To escape these, four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy have been sent to the England countryside. while there, they enter a wardrobe that magically seems to disappear the farther in you go into a wooded area in a world called Narnia. A world ruled by a cruel White Witch who has cast a spell that causes Narnia to be in winter forever, but never Christmas. Lucy, the youngest, was told early in the story of a White witch who ruled like she was queen, and of the spell that caused a hundred year winter and no Christmas. Edmund meets the White Witch, and unwittingly betrays his brother and sisters to her. a Beaver family explains to the rest of them that the Witch is afraid of a prophecy that says that four human children, two boys and two girls will take the throne and defeat the White Witch. They must now seek help from the one creature in all of Narnia that could possibly help them against such evil. Aslan, lord of the wood and the king of beasts.This is a wonderful adaptation from C.S. Lewis' classic book. Whether you like it or not, it is a Christian movie. C.S. Lewis didn't make a direct allegory, but made a supposition in the person of Aslan. What if there was a world where mythical creatures lived and talking animals existed? And what if God sent his son there in the form of a lion? Aslan is the animal representation of Jesus. And he is what makes this movie such an excellent piece of cinematography. And there is a battle, a dynamic battle between good and evil. The White Witch is perfectly portrayed, an almost beautiful, but cold evil that wishes to rule and destroy.The casting is perfect, and the effects are phenomenal. Nothing is really lost from the book that went into this movie. It even adds some characterization that adds very nicely to the movie. The battle scenes are epic and the most wonderful moment, morning at the Stone Table, is magnificent. I recommend this movie just as much as I recommend the Lord of the Rings. They are both wonderful fantasy stories that you can draw many Christian ideals from (or even just good morals if you want). There's more that I would love to say, but I think I've held you long enough. My final words, this is a wonderful movie that I think everyone should see.",10,2,6,9 December 2005
X-Men," Great movie. Just be careful. (spoiler)
","This is an awesome ride. The movie has great characters and actors to play them. Ian McKellen as Magneto was very good, and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier was a very smart thing on their end to do, I think. Hugh Jackman played the role of Wolverine to very near perfection. (ending with the list of characters there)The action is great, and the effects are decent. They have this one part (spoiler here) where they pit Wolverine against Mystique while in Logan's (Wolverine's) form. They did that so well. However, the whole movie is not innocent. Besides the action and typical profanities in movies today, there are some other problems. There is some crass mention of male genitalia. Logan uses one of his claws to give Cyclops the finger (while this may fly over the heads of many people, those who do catch it may have a problem with it). Toad also has some gross powers. Like when he throws that stuff Jean's face, those who know what it is (check out its color) may get a little queasy knowing just how sticky and strong it is. But the biggest problem in my opinion is Mystique's figure. I know that scientifically speaking, this is more sound then what the comics have, but she is very nearly totally naked. They put on just enough prosthetics and had most of her scenes dark enough so as to get by with PG-13 rating. Barely, though. So overall, I still love this movie. It's a great action/sci-fi/fantasy movie (fantasy because evolution is an unproven theory and it's a bogus theory). But just make sure you watch out for the crudities of this movie.",8,0,0,7 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best of the best.
","I'm sure that this is a movie that doesn't need commenting on, but I'm going to anyway. This, in my opinion, is the best of the Star Sars movies. It begins in Tatooine with the disgusting Jabba. Luke Skywalker displays his power of the Force and saves Han and the droids. Then the real adventure begins, with a seemingly dormant new Death Star. A battle with cute little teddy bears called Ewoks, a dazzling lightsaber duel between son and father, the revealment of the ultimate enemy, it reaches quite a level of excitement. The story is very good, the acting is superb, and the effects, like the other SW movies, are excellent, not only for then, but also for today.The costumes are also very good. The only thing in the movie that looked totally goofy was a blue alien that played for Jabba in the musicians section. It looked like a jazzed up stuffed elephant (probably what it was), but didn't take away from the feel of the movie. An excellent movie for SW fans, or those who like science fiction, or for those who are just looking for a good movie. This is one Star Wars that I recommend the most. May the Force be with you!",8,0,1,6 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Coulda been better, but the Force is still with it. Or is it?
","The second prequel to the original star wars trilogy, is ten years after Ep I, the Phantom Menace. Anakin is progressing well in his studies, and Padme is no longer Queen of Naboo, but Senator and representative of her planet alongside Jar Jar Binx in the Galactic Republic.But there's a lot of unrest. The Seperatist's numbers are growing, and there seems to be some new threats lurking in the dark corners of the galaxy...Overall, it's an OK movie, although almost everyone you talk to will agree that this is probably the worst of all the Star Wars movies. It would definitely have been better, but the actor they got for Padme was just cheesy. She couldn't deliver a line correctly to save herself from a raging Rancor Beast. Also, the movie was 2/3 dependent on its special effects to be successful, instead of also going for the emotion and storyline everyone has known and loved from Star Wars. Or at least, they expect a lot more from them.But don't get me wrong, this is a very good movie. The effects are phenomenal, except for one scene where it looks like a video game. The music is still up to par with all the other Star Wars, and of course, everyone loves seeing Jar Jar and R2-D2. C-3PO even got some good moments.All in all, it's really only a movie for computer geeks or Star Wars fans. Otherwise, you might be disappointed.",6,1,2,12 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," So it begins...
","The beginning to the epic trilogy, and what a beginning it is! After I read the Lord of the Rings, I was really excited about the movies that were coming out. Then I heard about all the changes they were going to make, and I was a little disappointed. At least, until I saw this movie! It was better then I would have expected! My favorite character has always been Frodo, and I think that Elijah Wood played him to perfection.From beginning to end, I loved how they made this movie. Peter Jackson and his crew have created a true masterpiece that I could not have predicted! The relationships start here, and so does the adventure of a lifetime. See this One Movie.",9,0,1,31 March 2004
Spider-Man," Woooooo-hoooooo!!!
","This is such an awesome ride! I have been waiting two years to see this movie, and I have finally seen it! This is great, just absolutely great!Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job as Peter Parker. I'm something like Peter before he got bit, so I could kinda relate to him. The way they re-wrote it more according to the new Ultimate Spider-man comics vs. the old classic way that Spider-man got his powers was marvelous. The action scenes were great. The only part about this movie that was a little hard to bear was the goblin costume. But, he was insane, so it didn't really cut away from his character. Back to the action, PULSE-POUNDING! Spider-man winding up fighting the goblin so many times was great. The hand-to-hand combat was superbly done. The CG battles were expert, and just everything oozed of greatness.As a long-time Spider-man fan, I'm very happy with this film, and so is my sister, who usually doesn't like him. Anyone who likes fun movies with plenty of thrills will not be disappointed by this blockbuster. Get caught in this web. You won't be sorry!",10,0,1,11 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Battle for Middle-earth has begun
","After the way the Fellowship of the Ring ended, I was determined to see this movie in the theaters. In this one, a whole new group of actors come onto the scene, and we finally get to see the face of Gollum!While Frodo is trying to get closer to Mordor, the big battle takes place at Helm's Deep, the last defense for the people of Rohan. Sauron is gaining power, Saruman has bred an army strictly for the purpose of destroying Men, do you feel the sweat on your palms yet?This is an almost perfect sequel to the first one, and precursor to the last one, the Return of the King! This movie is just so awesome, I cannot put it into words. The only thing I can really say is, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",9,0,0,31 March 2004
The Incredibles," As far as Computer-animation movies have been going, this one is alright.
","In an imaginary world, super-heroes are real and there are apparently a lot of them with numerous types of powers. They use them for good to defend people against those who support evil, lust for destruction and have an itch for monologuing on their evil plots. But, lots of people are still unhappy with them, claiming sometimes that they didn't wanna be saved, have suffered injuries during those rescues, and so on. Super-heroes nation-wide are being sued for everything they've got. So they're put into a special government protection where their pasts are erased, identities are protected and they can live normal lives on the condition they never use their powers again. This isn't so great for Mr. Incredible (a guy whose super-power is super-strength)who misses the action, protecting the innocent and the glory. Then he gets an offer by a mysterious secretary who calls herself Mirage (which is very convenient since he's just lost his job again), but it's not all kosher as he finds out. It ends up he has to be rescued by his wife, Elllastigirl and their children, Dash (the name tells you his super-power) and Violet, who has the ability to turn invisible and project force-fields.OK, I'd have to give it about five stars.One star is for the animation. Pixar is very good at doing these animations, and this movie is no exception. Between the backgrounds, the explosions, and the characters, the animation is some of the best I've seen around.The second star is for the funny moments. Unlike some other movies of this type, some of the humor isn't mind-numbing stupidity. There are some genuine humorous moments, such as when Frozone is looking for his super-suit and he's arguing his wife to find it.The third star is for the morals. The super-heroes risk their lives to protect innocent lives. Mr. Incredible is tempted to kill Mirage to get free of the trap, but opts not to. Family is placed on a high pedestal and Mr. Incredible realizes that he shouldn't place sought-after glory of being a super hero for spending time with his family.The fourth star is for the fact that they do a pretty decent job making fun of comic-book superheroes. From Marvel to DC, no super-power is safe from them. Flight, X-ray vision, the ability to freeze things, super-speed, the list goes on and they have a lot of fun poking fun at them all, even down to fashion ('Capes will be your downfall!'). As a superhero fan, I do like that.The fifth star is because, well, it's just plain old better then the last one, Finding Nemo. Oy, was that a mind-melter.If your kids enjoy superheroes, but you don't want to expose them to the life-action violence that X-men, Spider-man and Batman bring, then this is a pretty decent substitute.",8,1,4,2 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Always on the move.... *Beware of spoilers!!!!!!!!!*
","This is one excellent movie!!! The effects, the story, the action, it was tremendous! The story opens up over the home-world of Coruscant. Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi have been summoned to help stop the attack and save Chancellor Palpatine who has been kidnapped and taken onto one of the enemy ships by the movie's new enemy, General Grievous (a half droid, half alien commander). When Anakin and Obi-Wan find Palpatine, they have to confront Count Dooku, the guy who sliced off Anakin's arm in the last film. Obi-Wan is knocked out and it's down to Anakin and Dooku. In his anger, Anakin chops off Dooku's arms before slicing off his head with his own lightsaber. The Dark Lord of the Sith now had to look for a new apprentice. And he has someone in mind.After that, we find out that Padme is pregnant with Anakin's child. He says that he's happy, but he has dark dreams of her dying in childbirth. He becomes desperate to save her, claiming that he would be nothing without her.Meanwhile, Anakin's relationship with the Jedi Council is becoming estranged. He has been appointed by the Chancellor to be his representative on the council, and the Jedi accept him but don't promote him to the rank of Jedi Master, which he deems extremely unfair. The rest of the movie becomes considerably darker after this....This is by far the best installment of the Star Wars new trilogy. It wasn't nearly as bad violence-wise as I thought it would be (tho the fighting is still extremely intense, not appropriate for small children) and the acting, while still suffering from some bad delivery, is better then some people have deemed it the past few years. Even the girl who plays Padme was able to deliver some of her lines well.The effects hardly need mentioning. Star Wars has become notorious for having some of the best effects out there, and, while still not up to par with Lord of the Rings, are still outstanding. The Starship battles, creatures, the fighting scenes (much of it does have to be CG. There's no way you can get Christopher Lee to jump, do a somersault in the air, and then land squarely on his two feet without risking some serious back injury) and of course lightsabers and backgrounds are done better then in any other of the SW movies.The movie still suffers from skewed theology, which everyone has become accustomed to. Its highest peak of incorrectness is when Obi-Wan tells Anakin that only a Sith deals in absolutes. Not only does it attack many religions including Christianity for its 'single-mindedness', but it's contradictory since the Jedi seem to be absolutely devoted to protecting good and also seem to be absolutely sure that the Sith and their ways are evil. Also, it's saying that it's absolutely wrong to deal with absolutes. See how confusing it is? But ultimately, it's a satisfying thrill-ride that finishes the story of Anakin Skywalker and begins the tale of Darth Vader. It sets up for the original trilogy done in the 70's and 80's while giving the viewers the satisfaction that they haven't just wasted their money unless you're a stickler who does not accept some wooden acting in the least. The Force is indeed, strong with this one.",8,1,2,27 May 2005
X2: X-Men United," The first one was better, but this one is also great.
","This is a good super-hero movie. They still had the problems that they had the problems that plagued the first one, with a little more, but I won't go into it. Wolverine's past is still a mystery from before he met Stryker. I think it's because his mind blocks out anything that happened before he met up with Stryker. It has to do with his healing ability (apparently it's mental as well as physical, and in the comics, he did something very horrific). Cyclops taking on Jean like that was great. The idea to use Stryker's son to make that chemical (not sure if it's original or from the comics) was very smart, I thought. I notice that a lot of people I talk to also think that Storm and Kurt(Nightcrawler)have a romantic thing. I think they just have a great friendship and respect for each other. I think that Cyclops and Prof. X were kind of underused (well, maybe not the Professor), but that was to help us ask where did they go and what the heck is Stryker up to? This is another good movie. However, what really clinched it that the first one was better was the fact that they ended with a voice-over by Jean about the process of Evolution. This not as good as Spider-man, but it is better then Batman. Very nice. I just wish that there was another way for them to have their powers besides Evolution. Oh, well.",7,0,0,7 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best of the three
","I don't plan on giving away any of the important stuff, but this is to let you know that if you have seen or heard anyone trashing the Return of the King, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!The story line is amazing, how Peter was able to make the changes from the book and still have it come out like it is beyond me, the acting was incredible, and the effects were so great, there were parts where if I hadn't seen on the web certain things were CGI, no one in my family would have known.Such noble themes come on the screen as friendship, loyalty, love, perseverence and selflessness, to name a few. A lot of violence, but it draws the line to where you see spears getting thrust through an Orc, but you don't see anything pouring out of him.As a note to christians, this movie has great spiritual aspects to it. There are lots to things that Tolkien had that you could compare to the Bible that Peter Jackson wrote into the script.If you are only able to get one of the three films of the Lord of the Rings, get this one. It's perfect!",10,0,1,29 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Great! Don't get cocky, kid.
","OK, this was a pretty good movie with some pretty good effects (just make sure you don't overwatch it, or you'll get bored with it).The idea for Star Wars is pretty good. I loved the character of Darth Vader. I'm not saying I'm rooting for the bad guys, I'm saying that the idea of Vader is an interesting idea. I mean, think about it. The Jedi order is abolished, and the only one who is allowed to use the Force is the Sith (the dark side of the Force). My favorite characters are Han Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2. I like Luke too, but I don't think he became a real big big favorite until ROTJ. I also enjoyed Obi-Wan Kenobi. The effects are fantastic, especially for its time. The aliens are interesting, the bad guys are well-done (though how humans came to be the dominant species is a little surprising. Sorry, but compared to some of the other beings I saw in the Star Wars universe, it's a little surprising). I love the lightsabers and just about everything about this movie. The only problem I have is with the Force, as pretty much all Christians do. But we're able to draw enough Christian elements out of it to tolerate it.humor, action, and a lot of tension with Solo and Leia, very, very good. I don't know if it deserved the standing ovations it got in the theaters, but still great. A new hope indeed!",8,4,6,25 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Do, or do not. There is no maybe to watching this movie.
","This is definitely better then A New Hope (the first Star Wars for those of you who don't know its name). I think the thing that really made it stand above it was the appearance of Yoda. Also, I think the effects were better(just look at the battle of Hoth). We see all the old characters, and get to see one more character who is almost just as enjoyable as Han Solo. Lando Calrissian.Good effects (as is the always for Star Wars), good characters, a dark secret revealed (everyone knows it, but it's still considered a spoiler, so I'm not telling) and better action then the first one, this is definitely very good. On with the rebellion!",8,0,1,25 September 2004
