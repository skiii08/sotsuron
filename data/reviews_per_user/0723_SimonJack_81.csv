Walk the Line," A good biopic of the early year of Johnny Cash
","'Walk the Line' is a good biopic of the early years in the life of singer, songwriter, musician and actor Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix does a good job playing Cash as he breaks into music. The talented Cash, who became much more known as a quiet, withdrawn man for most of his performing life, had some raucous early years. The film covers his first marriage, road trips while struggling to make a name for himself, and his drug use. This also was the time when he met and befriended June Carter who would later become his wife. The film ends before the major part of his career with Carter - their last 35 years together. Reese Witherspoon gives a superb portrayal of Carter. She won the only Academy Award of five nominations for the film. But the movie took the top three Golden Globe honors for the year - best picture, best actress and best actor. Witherspoon also won the BAFTA award for best actress. Ginnifer Goodwin also gives a superb performance as Cash's first wife, Vivian. While Cash was known mostly as a country musician, he had a versatile portfolio of songs and performances. He played and sang blues, rock and roll, gospel and folk music. He is in three music halls of fame - Country, Gospel, and Rock and Roll. He sold more than 90 million records in his lifetime.As so many other musical biopics, 'Walk the Line' covers mostly the years up until the person makes it big. This is one when I would have enjoyed another 20 minutes or so to see performances of some of the top songs that Cash wrote and played. Cash and Carter died within four months of each other in 2003. He was 71 and she was 73.",7,2,2,14 June 2018
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Slow action and Holmes' martial arts become tiring after a while
","'A Game of Shadows' is the sequel to the modern first film, 'Sherlock Homes' of 2009. It continues with the slow-motion, pre-descriptive dialog of various scenes - especially those involving fighting. While I found the first of the fast-action fictional and comic book character films entertaining, the almost non-stop action began to wear thin after a few years.The real Holmes off Arthur Conan Doyle's creation solved crimes by his cunning and brain. That's apparently not enough for modern Hollywood firms and/or audiences. Now, they must have a Holmes who is a master in martial arts, fisticuffs, and brawling mayhem.So, this film soon became tiring, even though I stayed with it to the end. The one line I found quite clever and funny was by Holmes when he says, 'It's so overt it's covert. As with the previous film, the CGI work with this film makes the London streets and various scenes seem unreal - made up.",6,2,2,11 August 2019
The Monuments Men," Interesting war drama of little known MFAA
","'The Monuments Men' is based on real events of a special unit during World War II, and the men who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) section. The characters are fictitious. But George Clooney and Grant Heslov did a fine job of making the characters composites from several of the real men who served in the MFAA. Two books by Robert M. Edsel served as the main source for the screenplay. The first was 'Rescuing Da Vinci: Hitler and the Nazis Stole Europe's Great Art – America and Her Allies Recovered It,' in 2006. The second was a 2010 book, 'The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History.' All aspects of this movie are excellent. Some reviewers don't think the humor fits. Others think the movie is slow or boring. But for most movie buffs who have broad interests and curiosity, this film is a winner. The casting was very good, and I think the humor fits nicely. It compliments the seriousness and dangers of the mission, the obvious respect and love for art of the main characters, their willingness to risk their lives to save precious art works, and their awe at finding specific pieces and caches of great works. For a non-combat unit, the MFAA team has a good amount of action, suspense and intrigue. The reproductions of art pieces are excellent. Surely, some shots must have been of the actual works. Two of the 345 men of the MFAA were killed during the war – an Englishman and a Frenchman. In the film, two such fictitious characters are killed. The first MFAA unit broke down into pairs to scout various suspected or reported art caches. The movie also shows this. All told, the MFAA sought out and searched more than 1,000 treasure trove sites that contained more than 5 million pieces of stolen art. One of the MFAA characters in the movie comes close to a real WW II member. James Granger, played by Matt Damon, closely resembles Capt. James Rorimer, a curator of the NY Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the movie, he is recruited directly from his civilian position. In reality, Rorimer had signed up as an American infantryman in 1943, and was sought out and given a commission to be one of the original members of the MFAA. He met Rose Valland, whose character in the film resembles that of Claire Simone, played by Cate Blanchett. Rorimer later was promoted to chief of the MFAA section of the Seventh Army, and was in charge of seizing the art collections of both Herman Göring and Josef Goebbels. After the war, he returned to the Met where he later served as director for 11 years until his death in 1966. On the official Web site of the Monuments Men (www.monumentsmen.com), I found several other members who identified in part with the characters in the film. One was Capt. Deane Keller, a 5th U.S. Army MFAA officer from 1944 to 1946 in Italy. He served for 40 years as a Yale art professor after the war. The bios of different members place them at some of the major treasure trove sites in the film. The movie has a scene at Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, where more than 6,000 works of art were recovered. Another is at Berchtesgaden, Germany – site of Hitler's 'Eagle's Nest.' The 101st Airborne Division first reached there and found more than 1,000 paintings and sculptures stolen by Göring. Other scenes are in salt mines and caves where huge caches of art works were hidden. Merkers, Germany, and Altaussee, Austria, were among these. The latter had 6,500 paintings alone. It also had the two major works from Belgium that were covered at length in the movie. Michelangelo's sculpture, the Madonna of Bruges was found there, as was Jan van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece that was stolen from Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent. From the time the MFAA was established in 1944 under the Civil Affairs and Military Government section of the U.S. Army, a total of 345 men served in the section. They came from 13 nations. The U.S. had 216, England had 58, France had 23, 20 were from Austria, and 11 were from The Netherlands. The rest were from other countries including Belgium, Poland, New Zealand, Spain and Russia. Not all who served in the MFAA were curators, museum staffers, artists, teachers or architects – as are the characters in the film. Many were men who were just interested in the assignment, and who were transferred from other positions of active duty in Europe at the time. This was in the waning months of the war and the year after the war's end. But, the earliest members – those who did much of the searching and recovery efforts during hostilities, included some men who were recruited from civilian life and who had art and cultural backgrounds. The MFAA was disbanded in 1946, but a small group of about 60 art detectives continued to search for stolen art works for another six years. For all the great works and many millions of individual art pieces recovered by the MFAA, a sizable number of great works remains missing. Most are assumed to have been destroyed by the Germans. The movie has a scene with Germans burning a huge cache of paintings, including Raphael's Portrait of a Young Man. It was stolen by the Nazis from Poland, and is considered by many to be the most valuable of all art works yet lost from the war. A report in 2012 that it had resurfaced was a hoax. The MFAA wasn't just a sudden brainchild of someone during the war. Its roots go back to two lay organizations before the war. Anyone interested in more of the fascinating history of this program will find it on various sites on the Web.",9,2,5,7 March 2014
Catch Me If You Can," An unbelievable film, yet based on a true story
","As unbelievable as it seems to be, 'Catch Me If You Can' was based on a real person and his exploits. That included, by the time he was just 19 years of age, passing himself off as a major airline passenger jet pilot, a medical doctor, a lawyer, and a prison official. Frank Abagnale Jr. told his story in a book co-written by Stan Redding in 1980, by the same title as this film.Of course, in order to get away with any of his imposter roles, Abagnale had to look older than he was. And, the tricks and traits he developed for conning banks, businesses and people took imagination and some skill to learn. His story is a fascinating one and ideal for a very entertaining film. As the movie shows, Abagnale eventually was caught and spent time in jail. In reality, he served short sentences in France and Sweden before being extradited to the U.S. And, as the film notes at the end, he eventually turned his experience into a lucrative career and later business. He helped the FBI, banks and businesses to spot and protect against fraud.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale in this film, and Tom hanks plays Carl Hanratty. His role is based on the real FBI agent who was the chief pursuer of the cagey con man. That was Joseph Shea, who later was a close friend of Abagnale's until Shea's death.",7,0,1,11 August 2019
To Be or Not to Be," A classic war-time spoof of Nazi Germany
","'To Be or Not to Be' is one of a very small number of films that are genuine satire. Of course, satire is comedy and humor. But it can also be dramatic, action-filled, pathos, empathy and mystery or intrigue. It is most often a combination of these. The comedy is often the release or relief from what the story would be without it. The genius of comedy- satire is its ability to make audiences laugh by its treatment of a subject that most often is not otherwise very funny. Satire can cover any and all aspects of life, but the very best – and that with unquestionably wide appeal – is political satire. That's what we have in 'To Be or Not to Be.'I recall the first time I saw this movie – how I was gripped by the humor, then by the intrigue about what came next, then by concern that Carol Lombard would be found out, and then back to the humor again. This film has considerable darting between its emotion-inducing scenes. That makes it all the more a great satire and comedy. Of course, I knew it was to be a comedy. What else could it be with Jack Benny and Carole Lombard? Still, a somewhat zany story, with great screen writing and equally great direction by Ernst Lubitsch, was able to hold sway over my viewing. Then we add superb acting all around. Carol Lombard is excellent in her role as Maria Tura. Her humorous lines are very good, but as in many other films, her 'straight man' role plays perfectly with Jack Benny's Joseph Tura. His are the exaggerated blown-up lines, side glances, smirks and assorted facial expressions that ignite our uproarious laughter. Since my first viewing, I now watch this film for the pure humor and satire, and I watch for the many little subtleties that I often miss in such clever films on first viewing. And, they're not all by the main stars. The movie has several top-flight supporting actors of its day. They are the source of many of the laughs. Most are members of the Polish theater group. Felix Bressart plays Greenberg, Tom Dugan plays Bronski, Charles Halton plays Producer Dobosh, and Lionel Atwill plays Rawitch. Viewers knew for sure that the role of SS Col. Ehrhardt would not be too stern or serious – with Sig Ruman in the role. Robert Stack is very good in his role as Polish pilot, Lt. Stanislav Sobinski, and Stanley Ridges does well in the straightest role of the film, as Professor Siletsky.This film is a must for any movie library. It may not be as funny to younger audiences who haven't yet studied the history of the World War II period. The film was made in 1941, before the U.S. entered the war. Because America was still neutral, this movie was considered too controversial so it was held back. It was finally scheduled for release in March, 1942, Then a sad event preceded its opening when Carol Lombard was killed in a plane crash in January. She was just 33 years old.One oddity I found in this film occurred in a scene after Tura (playing Siletsky) leaves Col. Erhardt's office. The camera then pans to Erhardt's appointments calendar next to his name plaque on his desk. The top of the page is dated in large letters: '1941, Tuesday, December 16.' That seemed like a huge jump in time in the film – more than two years. The movie opens on Aug. 31, 1939, the day before Germany invades Poland. Are we to think that it was more than two years later that the rest of the events transpire? The U.S. would have been at war after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and surely there would have been some mention of that in the film. I think this was a slight oversight from the movie being filmed in late 1941 – before Pearl Harbor. Then, when the film's release was held back because the U.S. was not yet at war, this scene wasn't re-shot. The calendar most likely should have read 1939 or 1940 in the first place. Another little oddity appears on the calendar. It is filled in with appointments at 15-minute intervals. The 10:30 slot lists Maria Tura. And, at 10:45, a single name is listed: 'Schindler.' Might that be a reference to Oskar Schindler, whose story is told in the 1993 blockbuster film, 'Schindler's List?' If so, it would be ironic because people in 1941 (including Hollywood movie makers) would have known of Schindler only as an exploiter of Jewish labor for his wartime industrial plant in Krakow, Poland. Only after the war were Schindler's efforts made known – how he saved the lives of hundreds of Jews. Some of the lines in this film are riotously funny. Here are a couple samples. Tura/Siletsky says, 'I didn't like the way Capt. Schulz shifted the responsibility back to you.' Col. Erhardt, 'Neither did I. You know there's always something wrong with a man who doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't eat meat' Tura/Siletsky, 'You mean our Führer?' Erhardt, 'Oh, no. Please, professor, I hope you won't 'Before he leaves Erhardt's office, Tura (playing the fake Siletsky) asks if Erhardt had heard of that great, great Polish actor Joseph Tura. Erhardt says, 'Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, I saw him on stage when I was in Warsaw once before the war.' Tura/Siletsky says, rhetorically, 'Really?' And Erhardt replies, 'What he did to Shakespeare we are doing now to Poland.'",10,3,8,6 November 2014
The Death of Stalin," There's great satire in the reality of Soviet succession
","'The Death of Stalin' is a wonderful, biting satire of the Soviet Union, period. The plot is all about the death of the biggest mass murderer in history, and the scramble for power in the next few days. But that's the story of the Soviet Union from its beginning. Only, with Stalin in power for so many years, the U.S.S.R., and the world, hadn't experienced the political trauma of a change in the Soviet for a long time. Those who lived from World War II to the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, know all too well that there were immense - and deadly - power struggles within Russia.This film puts dialog, details and people together in a scenario of how it probably happened. This is a very funny yet serious satire about the Soviet leadership. The filmmakers said that they didn't want to make it a whimsical or hilarious comedy in deference to the memories of the millions of people who were killed under Stalin. So, this film doesn't trivialize what Stalin and company did. Instead, the plot plays a straight drama about first doubting Stalin's death, and then scrambling for power in the aftermath. And in that - the real behavior and ingrained methods of the Soviet leadership, the satire rises almost to a roar.This is an excellent production in all aspects. All of the cast are superb. Steve Buscemi is especially good as Nikita Khrushchev. And, Simon Beale was outstanding in the role of Lavrenti Beria. He also had an uncanny resemblance to Beria. The cast includes actors for all the principal Soviet roles at the time of Stalin's demise, including his son and daughter.Some people may be bothered by the almost constant shooting of people by Russian police and military. No doubt it's exaggerated but it drives home the point of widespread paranoia that must have existed. Reprisals, denunciations and executions were very real and frequent under the Soviets.So, besides the comedy and satire, this film has some historical value. To date, no other film has been made that deals with the Soviet leadership and succession over the years. Until that is done, this film will fit that need nicely.",9,0,0,11 February 2019
Fury," Hype can't even paint this film as anything near reality
","For all it's hype about creating a real 'feeling' for this movie, the Columbia team hasn't managed to fool many people. I appreciated the many reviewers who saw how unreal this film is. Now, how can anyone today – seven decades after WWII know what was real? Well, by the stories and news we grew up with during and in the years right after the war. And the many books, novels, diaries, and movies produced in the first few decades after the war. And, in the newsreels, we watched in theaters, and the live action filming for documentaries. Until the 21st century, most criticism of the Hollywood productions about WWII were that they often glorified the American GIs in combat, or they too often involved romances that the bulk of the fighting men never experienced, or that the equipment used for the movies wasn't accurate. The early WWII films didn't show the graphic gore of war that 'Saving Private Ryan' ushered into films in 1998; but many of those films showed the angst, anguish, fear, fatigue, and other aspects of war on the men fighting it. And, most did not make the enemy out to be inept; but very formidable combatants. A special bonus short documentary with the DVD of 'Fury' has interviews with some of the main actors. Brad Pitt, Shia LeBeouf, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal talk about their preparation for the film. A Navy SEAL team apparently 'trained' the actors for a week of what GIs would have gone through in basic training. So, their testimonials were that they learned to bond as a group in that one week. Really? And, while basic training is similar in all the services, would the Navy know more about tank training? One suspects that the movie makers were trying to hype the film by using the latest men of the military spotlight in their movie project. In reality, I doubt that the actors would have had any better training or learned to bond as brothers than if their trainers had been Special Forces, Rangers, Paratroopers, Marines, or regular Army training units. Hmmm. Why not even an armored unit?The narrator of the short documentary said the movie makers met behind closed doors with a few WWII vets – now in their 90s, from the 2nd Armored Division. He said that the vets told them stories that they had never told even to family members. Interestingly, the filmmakers don't claim that the movie is based in any way on what they heard from the veterans. Again, some modern day Hollywood hype, I suspect. I appreciated the comments of those early reviewers who point out some of the most obvious aspects of the film that deny its reality. This is the most foul-mouthed bunch of GIs I've ever heard and can imagine. Yes, those men of my father's age were known to curse, swear or cuss on occasion. But it was not their common language. I served in the Army from 1961 to 1964, and we too used an occasional cuss or swear word. Occasional, not part of our running, everyday language. The same is true today, the younger service people tell me. So, the 'Fury' filmmakers aren't giving us a look at reality of the closing days of combat in WWII Germany. No, they are giving us here a modern portrayal of a time past.This 'unreality' check applies equally to the portrayal of the Germans in the long closing battle scene. Brad Pit's character, Sergeant Don Collier even notes that the approaching Germans are a crack SS battalion. And, the film seems to portray such. So this large force of crack German troops in so inept that the Americans are able to mow most of them down in a very long pitched battle from one immobile tank position smack dab out in the open. The Germans fire a couple anti- tank torpedoes that don't do much damage, and they don't shoot anymore. Besides these major detractions for this film, 'Fury' has a weak script and character parts that just aren't very interesting or believable. Can anyone imagine that all, most or even a significant number of American GIs were all so completely hardened and able to dismiss killing as though it were nothing? From the beginning, the performances seemed forced. It seemed to me that the selling point for the film is intended to be the amount of gore and fabricated and exaggerated action that they could produce. The film seemed more to me like a video game than a realistic portrayal of a unit in WWII combat. It seems that Hollywood is trying to reinvent WWII for audiences in the 21st century. This is one modern film that just doesn't accurately reflect the culture of the 1940s. So, it doesn't have a place in my war film library. If young buffs today want a more accurate 'feel' for WWII, they can watch almost any of the many Hollywood films made about the war by the major studios through the 1980s. And, even later films by the movie industries in European countries.",3,20,46,18 April 2015
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," A war and love story about Italy and Greek islanders in WW II
","'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is based on a 1994 novel of the same name. I haven't read British author Louis de Berniéres' book; so my take on this story is solely based on the quality of the film. I first saw the movie in a theater when it came out. I enjoyed it enough, that years later I bought the DVD – primarily for my WW II movie collection. I have since watched this film a couple of times. Those who read and enjoy history know the general story of Italy's involvement in WW II. Under the tyrant Mussolini, the Italians went to war on the side of Nazi Germany. We also know that most Italians' hearts were not with their official cause. So, after Mussolini was overthrown on July 25, 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allies. Nicolas Cage, as Capt. Corelli, makes that point in the film when he says that Italy surrendered to Great Britain and the United States – not to Germany. The Italians in southern Italy later fought with the Allies; while in the North under German control, the Italians were involved in many underground operations. They hid Jews and helped downed Allied pilots escape, and carried out espionage against the Germans. This movie, like the book it's based on, is a story of Italians who were sent to occupy the large Greek island of Cephalonia. And, of their heroic conflict with the superior German forces after Italy surrendered to the Allies. It is also a story about the island, its people and tumultuous history. And, it is a love story about the Italian captain and the island doctor's daughter, Pelagia, played by Penélope Cruz. The acting, directing and all aspects of this film are excellent. The cinematography is outstanding. The film was made on the island of Cephalonia. When I first saw this film, and since then, I've recalled another recent unusual film set in Italy in the war. 'Life is Beautiful' came out in 1997. It was filmed in Italian, German and English, and won 3 Oscars of 7 nominations. It was a warmly told story about a Jewish father who makes a game out of his family's incarceration by the Germans in order to save his young son's life and spare him the horror of what was happening. That film endeared movie-goers at the time – if not all of the industry critics. 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' didn't fare as well. It had a big budget -- $57 million, but the critics mostly didn't like it, and it wasn't a box office hit. It is an American-made movie with American actors. But it is set in the actual location of the story. While the story is different, I think it is of the same ilk as the earlier film. It shows hope and humanity amidst tyranny. I think this film does an excellent job with its story. It is a very good love story as well, and I highly recommend it. I especially like the lines by Dr. Iannis (John Hurt) when he explains true love to his daughter, Pelagia (Penélope Cruz). He says, 'When you fall in love, it is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness. It is not excitement. It is not the desire to mate every second of the day. It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body. No! Don't blush! I'm telling you some truths. That is just being in love, which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over, when being is love has burned away. Doesn't sound very exciting, does it? But it is.'",9,0,0,6 August 2014
World War Z," Zombie-fest of mayhem and little else
","'World War Z' earns four stars for two attributes. It is almost non-stop action for those who enjoy adrenaline-depleting films of the characters within. And, it has very good makeup for the various zombies. I don't rate films on the basis of CGI because that always looks phony to me, and for that reason I don't think it's to be celebrated for cinema art. The two biggest negatives of the film are the plot and the acting. Come on, Paramount and associates, surely you could dream up some source - cause and place, of the zombie outbreak. It wasn't in New Jersey. It wasn't in South Korea. It wasn't in Jerusalem. It wasn't in India. It wasn't in Wales. So, where did it first appear? And what was the cause? This is sci-fi (fiction), so make up something to fill a big hole and question in the plot. Then there's the one zombie in captivity in the Wales research lab. How did they happen to capture it? Especially such meek and mild scientists?Then, there's the acting; or more accurately, the lack thereof. To some extent one shouldn't expect to see much acting in fast-paced action films such as this. What is there to emote or portray when the cast is mostly running around or hurriedly moving all the time? But in this case, there are a couple of slow scenes, and the audience sees Brad Pitt with his mouth half agape and motionless, looking at other actors who are talking. He appears stupefied. This lasts long enough each time to make one who appreciates good acting wonder if Pitt fell asleep with his eyes open. No one else in the cast of otherwise little known performers does anything to suggest that any roles called for acting in this weird sci-fi flick. Even in the 'logic' for the zombies, the whole production group seemed to miss one thing that was outlandish. Given that whatever makes the zombie a zombie, it can bring dead back to life - or to a state of 'undead,' that is able to act alive and move about. Apparently, the only thing that stops them from getting back up is shooting them in the head - or blowing their brains and head off. But the film shows dozens of these zombies falling off tall building, smashing onto the pavement and steel structures and then getting up and tearing off. So, with all those broken legs, backs and necks, the bodies could still run as if they had no such debilitating injuries. This zombie-fest is mostly a long show of mayhem with nothing to recommend it as an even fair movie.",4,1,6,18 January 2018
Stripes," Adult comedy is very funny in parts
","Most folks who have served in the military should enjoy this film. But for certain parts and embellishment or extension of others, it could be a great comedy. The gratuitous Hollywood sex scenes don't add to the comedy, but detract from it. I suspect that the scenes of bikini- clad women mud-wrestling would be a turn-off for many people. I'm aware of the generational and specific cultural appeal this film seemed to be designed to reach. Still, it's too bad that the filmmakers couldn't see the great possibility for a dynamite film around this plot – sans the detracting sex element. It had potential to be a very funny comedy and spoof of the military and satire of the Cold War period. The main male stars of 'Stripes' are hilarious in their roles. Bill Murray is John, Harold Ramis is Russell, Warren Oates is Sgt. Hulka and John Larrouquette is Capt. Stillman. John Candy is wasted in the role of Ox. Three superb scenarios make this movie worth viewing by adults. The drill routine of the platoon for the formal military review is outstanding. The misadventure of Capt. Stillman leading some of the platoon into Soviet Czechoslovakia is hilarious, with the subsequent rescue effort by John and Russell in the secret urban assault vehicle. And the ending scene is very funny with results of the escapade for the individuals as the credits role. The plot of 'Stripes' could have been developed into a great film. Instead, it provides a few hilarious sketches amidst the humdrum riffraff of sexploitation.",7,0,1,22 October 2016
Public Enemies," Wrong focus on this romanticized crime film
","It's okay to make a modern movie about one of the most notorious criminals in American history. And, the makers and cast of 'Public Enemies' did a good job in portraying the main characters. Johnny Depp does a decent job portraying the fun-loving nature of John Dillinger. If anything, he is not as humorous or frequently smiling as the real J.D. And, Christian Bale portrays the always somber FBI agent Melvin Purvis well. Billy Crudup does a good job portraying the young, impetuous J. Edgar Hoover. 'Public Enemies' also is a good portrayal of the widespread lawlessness of the time. Prohibition lasted from 1920 to the end of 1933. Bootleg booze was big business and organized crime flourished. The Great Depression was on and many homeless and jobless Americans turned to crime. The almost wholesale corruption of law enforcement in Chicago made it a haven for criminals.Thus, John Dillinger returned often to his base of operations after his bank robberies. To this extent, this film does a good job. But, from then on, one begins to wonder. Dillinger joked with the press and liked publicity. And, there was something of a cult following, especially among the young, including boys. Some had a skewed notion of Dillinger as a sort of Robin Hood. And this film seems to play along with that. If anything the dour Purvis is pictured as an obsessed pursuer. Of all the criminal charges against Dillinger, he had just one charge of homicide against him. But this film shows him in scene after scene with Tommy Guns and pistols blazing away and people falling to the ground. Is one to think that Dillinger couldn't hit anyone and that only others in his gang were able to shoot all those people?The film has a scene of a fictional meeting between Dillinger and Purvis. They never did meet face to face in real life. In the movie, Dillinger is behind bars and Purvis comes to look at him. As Purvis walks away, Dillinger says to him, that he should change his line of work. At that point, Bale (Purvis) stops and the camera holds on him a few seconds, showing that he's obviously thinking something. What was the point of that piece of fiction? Might not the writers instead have had Purvis make that statement to Dillinger? That would have squared more with the matter of right and wrong among those shown in this film. After all, wasn't it Dillinger who was being hunted and constantly fleeing to avoid the law? Wasn't it he who was in the wrong 'line of work?'The film overall seems to have slight empathy for Dillinger and his girlfriend, Billie (played by Marion Cotillard). It never shows anything about the FBI agents, police, people in banks or others who are killed. There is no empathy for the families of those people. 'Public Enemies' overall seems to glamorize the lives of a bunch of brazen bank robbers and killers. It sure is a lousy public statement about right and wrong, justice and law and order. One wonders why this film was made at all. Incidentally, the Tommy gun could be fired with a 100-round drum or a 32-round magazine feeding bullets at a rate of 900 per minute. In the film, the actors were using magazines. Yet only a couple of times did it show anyone changing a magazine. But many scenese showed the robbers firing the Tommy guns for long blasts, one after another. And never a change of ammo.",5,2,3,25 June 2018
Dead Poets Society," A question of justice misdirected
","The acting in 'Dead Poets Society' is very good all around. The plot is an interesting one. It's the type of story that Robin Williams liked doing for much of his career. His characters mostly are far from the ordinary, usual, or everyday people. Often, they are played for the sympathy of the audience. And, that's okay - to an extent. When the character is a hero who does something for the good of others, or thinks of others, he is the proverbial 'good guy. One thinks of such films in which Williams starred. 'Awakenings' of 1990 was a fine movie, as was 'Patch Adams' of 1998. Williams was superb in 'Jakob the Liar' of 1999. But is his John Keating such a person in this film? It's one thing to encourage students to be themselves, to become original, to pursue their dreams. But without the attention to those students, their characters and situations, the teacher ducks responsibility for himself or herself. Then, his uniqueness or difference in methods is really more self-centered. It's not a true interest in the students for their welfare and well-being. The end of this film is melodramatic, and a way for the students to overcome their disgrace at lying. It never is clear why they would need to be off the hook for anything themselves. Obviously, the institution wanted to find a scapegoat, and the father wanted a culprit. Keating seems to accept the class salute at the end as a good sign and squaring of the students with him. But that doesn't remove his complicity. How much guilt did he feel or show for what happened? Would a teacher who really cared for his students have not been more aware and interested to see that something so drastic as this didn't happen to someone in his class? Would such a death have ever occurred, had he not encouraged his students to be bold, to challenge authority and family?This is one film in which Williams could have played a character who owns up to a failure in responsibility. Instead, one is treated to a tutor who is put upon for being unjustly dismissed. Was his career more important than the life of any one of his students? Where is the justice when a student takes his own life?",7,0,0,22 June 2018
A Bridge Too Far," One of the best historical war movies ever made
","'A Bridge Too Far' is one of the best war movies ever made. It's based on a 1974 historical novel by Cornelius Ryan who also wrote 'The Longest Day' in 1959. Ryan was highly regarded for the detail of research for his books. He strove for accuracy and authenticity. Ryan was born in Dublin in 1920 and became a British war correspondent for The Daily Telegraph in 1941. He went on 14 bombing missions with the U.S. Army Air Forces. On D-Day (June 6, 1944), he flew over the Normandy beaches in a bomber. Then, after returning to England, he went to Normandy on a patrol boat the same day. He later covered Lt. Gen. George Patton's Third Army, and then reported on the war in the Pacific. Ryan's 'The Longest Day' sold millions of copies and was the basis for the 1962 movie by the same name. He wrote the screenplay for that blockbuster film that won two Oscars. In an item in Time Magazine of Dec. 9, 1974, Ryan was quoted: 'What I write about is not war but the courage of man.' There can be no doubt about that in his two books that were made into two of the best historical war films of all time. Besides the logistics, planning, and background details and facts, Ryan incorporates the characters and personalities of individual men in his stories. He covers Allied and Axis forces alike, from generals to sergeants to privates.'A Bridge Too Far' is about Operation Market Garden. It has gritty, tough, scenes of men in battle on both sides. Much time is devoted to the fighting of the British 1st Airborne Division in the Battle of Arnhem. The advance airborne battalion under Lt. Col. John D. Frost (played superbly by Anthony Hopkins) captures one end of the Arnhem bridge and then holds out for nine days. All this with ammunition running out and no resupply or reinforcements, while the Germans throw heavy artillery, tanks and mechanized infantry attacks at them. Elsewhere, the rest of the division commanded by Major General Roy Urquhart (played superbly by Sean Connery) is divided, cut off and surrounded by German forces. Operation Market Garden failed because the Allies did not capture the Rhine bridge at Arnhem and had to retreat. It was planned to spearhead a drive to capture the Ruhr Valley and shut down Germany's war production plants. The American 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions did secure river crossings at Eindhoven and Nijmegen, respectively. But the British XXX Corps met with strong German opposition and slowed to a crawl on the ground. It failed to reach the British paratroopers 64 miles away in just two days as planned. So, the whole operation bogged down, with only the ground gained to Nijmegen. 'A Bridge Too Far,' covers the entire Operation Market Garden. For the first time, the public got a look at the foibles and errors in planning this major wartime operation. The film shows the questions raised by various commands and officers at the time. The major foul- ups were many, and the outcome was disastrous for the British and Polish paratroopers. Just over 2,000 of the 10,000 plus British and Polish force were able to escape when ordered to retreat. The rest were killed, wounded or captured. Not a single radio worked for the British Airborne forces, so they couldn't communicate among their units or with headquarters. How could they go into combat without tested and working equipment? The film shows how. The planners put the landing zone for the Brits eight miles from their target bridge. So a surprise strike and quick capture of the bridge wasn't to be. But the Germans would have time to cut off units and surround them. There weren't enough aircraft for all the forces to strike together the first day. So, units were dropped over three days. Again, there was no surprise or catching the Germans off guard. Instead, they had time to surround the British landing zone. The top brass dismissed aerial photography that showed hidden German tanks. The operation leaders didn't believe or trust the underground reports they received. Yet the Dutch had been reliable for four years. And, when unit commanders expressed concerns, the top brass dismissed them. There were many signs of military incompetence at various levels in this film, but mostly at the top. 'A Bridge Too Far' is an independent film made by Joseph Levine and Directed by acclaimed English actor and director, Richard Attenborough. The production team and crew read like a British telephone directory. The cast includes 20 big name American and British actors of the day. Numerous Allied commanders from Market Garden, now retired, served as consultants during the making of the film. Besides Urquhart and Frost, already mentioned, these included Maj. Gen. Brian Horrocks (played superbly by Edward Fox), Brig. Gen. James Gavin (37 years old at the time, and played very well by Ryan O'Neal), and Brigadier Joe Vandeleur (played superbly by Michael Caine). The movie was filmed at several locations in The Netherlands. There are some small equipment goofs, but the military equipment and armament are very impressive. The special effects are 'dynamite.' The filming of the C-47 'Dakota' transport planes and the towed gliders is wonderful. The parachute jump is one of the best and most impressive I've seen on film (I am a former paratrooper). And the musical score for the film is excellent. This movie didn't receive a single Academy Award nomination in 1974. And it was a year that had very few good films. So, Hollywood blew it by ignoring this great movie. The film did win three BAFTA awards with four more nominations. 'A Bridge Too Far' will likely be held as one of the great historical war movies of all time.",10,9,13,14 November 2015
Zodiac," A serial killer who could have been stopped
","The performances by all of the cast in 'Zodiac' are very good. One can't know how well they reflect the personas of the real people they portrayed from the book and true story. But, the film gives a sense of reality in the roles of the investigating detectives and police, and of the lead character. Jake Gyllenhall plays the real Robert Graysmith, according to Graysmith's book. He was a normally shy and timid political cartoonist who became obsessed with finding the identify of the serial killer, Zodiac.Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play inspectors David Toschi and William Armstrong of the San Francisco police. And, Elias Koteas plays Sgt. Jack Mulanax of the Vallejo police.Graysmith wrote the novel about the Zodiac murders of northern California and the search for the killer who called himself Zodiac. The story takes place from 1969 into the 1990s. And the mystery has not yet been officially solved.I haven't read Graysmith's book of the same title. But I can recall the headlines and gist of the Zodiac killings from the news of that time. The movie does a good job of showing the intensity of the main people involved in trying to crack the case. It also shows an initial lack of cooperation among local police departments. No doubt, the Zodiac killings were a wake-up for law enforcement entities to eagerly cooperate to solve crimes in the future.In spite of the earnest efforts of the principal investigators, the movie (if not the book also) shows some weaknesses and mistakes that probably kept the law from solving the crimes. One weakness was in the heavy reliance at the time on handwriting analysis. The conclusion by the handwriting expert, Melvin Belli (played by Brian Cox) was taken flatly as proof that various suspects were not Zodiac. That included the most likely suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen. Although still used today, handwriting is highly disputed. If some people can fool a lie detector test, some surely could alter or modify their handwriting sufficiently to fool the analysts.The movie shows two glaring mistakes or oversights. When Toschi and Armstrong interviewed Arthur Leigh Allen at his work, they were highly suspicious of him. Why didn't they get an immediate search warrant for his residence? We learned later that in less than 48 hours, Allen moved a lot of stuff out of his residence. So, when the police finally did search the place, they found nothing incriminating. But the biggest error was in not pursuing Michael Mageau after he moved away. He survived the July 4, 1969 shooting that began the Zodiac's spree. And, he was the one and only person who saw the killer's face and could identify him.Indeed, the scene at the very end shows Mageau picking Arthur Allen's photo out of several shown him. Officer George Bawart had replaced the retired Jack Mulanax in the Vallejo police department. He met with Mageau in 1991, and Mageau was quick to identify Arthur Allen as the person who shot him 22 years earlier. Had the police tracked down Mageau in 1969 or 1970, they would have had Zodiac convicted on the basis of an eyewitness survivor, supported by much circumstantial evidence.Instead, the movie shows what happened 22 years after the start of Zodiac's killing spree. Before the police could charge Allen with the murders, after Mageau's 1991 ID of him, Allen died of a heart attack. So, that one big mistake by the police in 1969-70, led to years and years of searching, checking, and working by several people - all without a solution. The movie never explains why the police did not try to go after Mageau to have him look at photos of suspects.",8,0,0,10 November 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A great satire and a truly great film
","'Dr. Strangelove' is among the best satires ever put on film. I only wonder that it didn't receive at least two or three acting nominations for Academy Awards. But, 1965 was a year of heavy competition, with many great films. Still, how could Peter Sellers not get a nomination for his masterful job in handling three completely different roles? The Oscar for best actor that year went to Lee Marvin for 'Cat Balou.' Marvin was good, but I don't think he was as good as any of the other four nominees. Perhaps it was easier to pick him from the pack with Peter Sellers' name not in the running. I think Hollywood made a sentimental choice that year, but clearly goofed in passing over the superb cast and acting jobs in 'Dr. Strangelove.'The best supporting actor Oscar for 1965 went to Martin Balsam for 'A Thousand Clowns.' He was a worthy choice among great competition. But none of those on the list gave markedly better performances than two actors in 'Dr. Strangelove.' George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden both had outstanding performances and should have been nominated. Some viewers may be interested to know that Sterling Hayden was in espionage for the Allies during World War II. He worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the American wartime intelligence service. He went by the name, John Hamilton. He ferried supplies from Italy to partisans in Yugoslavia and did undercover work in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. Hayden was awarded a silver star for his service. A few roles and scenes in this film are side-splitting funny. The script is a masterpiece of wit throughout, with puns and metaphors galore. The Air Force Base is Burpelson. Would anyone guess that the film was made in England? The base commander was General Jack D. Ripper (played by Hayden). The base deputy commander is an RAF officer, Group Captain Mandrake – one of Sellers' roles. The U.S. President is Merkin Muffley (another Sellers role), and the Soviet Union Premier – who's never seen or heard, is Premier Dmitri Kissoff. The Soviet ambassador is Alexi de Sadesky (reference to the Marquis de Sade), played by Peter Bull. George C. Scott plays the top U.S. Army general, 'Buck' Turgidson (turgid means swollen, congested). Keenan Wynn plays Col. 'Bat' Guano. For those who may not have caught that one, guano is the Spanish word for excrement of cave-dwelling bats. Other names have innuendos as well. The cap of Sellers' roles was as Dr. Strangelove. In the movie, Turgidson asks Mr. Staines, 'Strangelove? What kind of a name is that? That ain't no Kraut name, is it?' Staines replies, 'He changed it when he became a citizen. It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.' Turgidson responds, 'Well, a Kraut by any other name, huh, Stainesy?' Merkwurdichliebe is a compound that isn't readily translatable. 'I love remembering wurd.' The last scene with Sellers as Strangelove is riotously funny. It may be the funniest scene ever put on film. A mark of the genius of this film is its script that intersperses serious, sensible and concerned lines with some outlandishly funny ones. These stand out even without video. But the visual scenes, with the facial expressions and contortions, compound the humor. Sellers' last scene without the video would lose much. Even after nearly 50 years, this film is as funny as when it came out. Here are some of my favorite hilarious lines from the movie. Gen. Ripper: 'I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration  and the ultimate Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.' Pres. Muffley: 'Gentlemen! You can't fight in here. This is a war room.' Muffley, on the phone to Soviet Premier Kissoff: 'One of our base commanders went a little funny in the head.' And, later, to Kissoff: 'I am very sorry. All right, you're sorrier than I am. But I am sorry as well. I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri. Don't say that you're more sorry than I am  because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are. So, we're both sorry, alright?'On learning of the Soviet doomsday machine, Pres. Muffley says to Soviet ambassador de Sadesky, 'This is absolute madness. Why should you build such a thing?' The ambassador replies, 'There are those of us who fought against it, but in the end we could not keep up with the expense involved in the arms race, the space race, and the peace race. At the same time, our people grumbled for more nylons and washing machines. Our doomsday scheme cost us just a small fraction of what we have been spending on defense in a single year.'Strangelove says,' Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy the fear of attack.' Then, to the Soviet ambassador, he says, 'The whole point of the doomsday machine is lost if you keep it a secret. Why didn't you tell the world?' Sadesky says, 'It was to be announced at the Party Congress on Monday. As you know, the premier loves surprises.'The last scene has Strangelove describing how a remnant of the human race could survive thousands of feet underground, and Turgidson suspecting a Soviet move to take over the U.S. deep mines. Strangelove, caught up in the exciting possibilities, rises from his wheel chair and starts walking toward the president. He looks down at his legs and shouts, 'Mein Fuhrer, I can walk.' The film closes with a musical score set to scenes of distant horizons with bright flashes and mushroom clouds rising. This is a classic satire that should live on for generations to see, heed and enjoy.",10,1,4,17 March 2014
The Bodyguard," Some drama, intrigue, crime, music and romance
","'The Bodyguard' has some drama, a little intrigue, crime, music and romance. That's about the best that can be said for this film. It has just enough of each to hold one's interest to the end. And, the ending makes watching this film worthwhile. It's the best part of the movie.Everyone knows, or should know, the plot. A former CIA agent is hired to protect a hot female singer. And, he falls for her and she for him. Whitney Houston is good as Rachel Marron, the big name singer. Kevin Costner is mostly wooden as Frank Farmer. I get it, as I think most movie buffs do, that a real bodyguard doing a serious job is not going to be a friendly, funny Joe with the people around him. Mike Starr's Tony, as such a glad-hand character, exaggerates that notion with his distractions for lunch, watching and enjoying the show, etc.But Costner's Farmer goes to the extreme in the opposite direction. He's almost sullen in his constant alertness. He's overly calm and slow to the point that he doesn't shoe much life or intelligence behind his apparent thinking and critical watching. The plot dances around, as do the scenes, with sharp breaks, so it doesn't have a feel of fluid continuity.One very good scene in this movie makes it worth watching. It takes place at night in the kitchen of Rachel Marron's mansion. Frank Farmer is sitting alone at a counter drinking his orange juice. He has just gotten Rachel home safely after a near riot broke out with her fans at an event. When they sped away, they left Tony behind.Now Tony kicks the door in. He's mad and goes after Frank - four times. Each time, Frank uses his martial arts and fisticuffs and lays big Tony out. Tony's face is bloody and he's about to try a fifth time with a big butcher knife. Frank picks up another knife and hurls it so that it sinks into the woodwork beside Tony's head. Tony backs down. Not a word has been spoken to this time. Frank turns to leave and says, 'I don't wanna talk about this again.",6,0,0,14 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A great wrap on the original story
","The third of the original trilogy of Star Wars warps up the story beautifully. George Lucas would write and produce two more trilogies - in a prequel and then sequel series. But this first series contains a whole story in itself. The next two trilogies are good, and sci-fi fans should enjoy them. But, as with other movies that been made in the past, nothing can match the originals for interest and enjoyment.The best action and special effects in this film have to do with the good guys battling the bad guys on Jabba the Hut's Tatooine. Princess Leia shows her muscle. Again, there are more creatures and weapon machines. The very young are probably taken most with the Ewoks on the planet, Endor. They do look a lot like scruffy Teddy bears.Here are some favorite lines from this film:C-3PO, 'If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hut, you'd probably short-circuit.'Jabba the Hut, 'This bounty hunter is my kind of scum.'Luke Skywalker, 'Your over confidence is your weakness.' The Emperor, 'Your faith in your friends is yours.'",10,0,1,12 July 2019
Elf," Modern Christmas fairy tale has some good laughs
","This film has a very good cast with some big names of the time and past in entertainment. 'Elf' is a modern Christmas fairy tale that scores well just for its comedy. Somewhere amid the crazy antics and situations there is a Christmas message or two. But this film is something to enjoy just for the laughs. Most of the humor comes from an overgrown elf trying to adapt and learn how to live in an adult world. Along the way, he spreads some Christmas joy. Will Ferrell is Buddy – an overgrown elf by mistake, whose doings resemble the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and Merwin's magic. It's hard to imagine anyone else giving the performance Ferrell gives here. The role seems written for him. Bob Newhart is Papa Elf. I don't know any other comedian who could get people to laugh so much with a straight face. He applies his trademark as well in 'Elf.' Edward Asner is Santa Claus, and James Caan is Buddy's real father, Walter. A host of younger actors do very well in their supporting roles. This is a fun movie that most should enjoy for the silliness and laughter.",7,3,3,8 December 2016
Shutter Island," A thinly plotted ensemble with dreary, disconnected flashbacks
","'Shutter Island' provides early clues that something is amiss with the lead character, Teddy Daniels. And that leads one to think that the mystery has a twist that is different than what the film purports to be about. I didn't read Dennis Lehane's novel on which the film is based. But, if he wrote it in the way this film portrays the story, it had to be a difficult read to follow. Flashbacks are a nice (and convenient) tool in storytelling and motion pictures, but they should only be used sparingly. Otherwise, they can distract from the story. In this case, their frequency and disconnectedness soon wear the film out and tire the viewer.I watched this film in the theater when it came out. I watched it again recently, and have a less enthusiastic response. I particularly enjoy good mysteries. The when, and how, and who, and why of a good suspense or crime story can be gripping and hold one's attention and interest. But these psychological thrillers sometimes muddle the plot and leave one wondering if a crime actually happened. So, the mystery isn't in solving a crime so much as it is in finding out if one was even committed at all.That's the sort of feeling one gets with this film. Then, it has elements that may seem like red herrings. The idea of Communist insurrectionists, plotters against the government, and some other items might be intended as red herrings, but they seem to be more overkill in the makeup of a crazy character.The use of so many flashbacks is probably necessary to arrive at the conclusion of the film. But they ignore the usual aspects of good movies and storytelling. So, instead of a tight plot this film seems to be a collection of different stories and random scenes and incidents tossed together with techniques to otherwise tantalize an audience. That may be very convenient for Hollywood, but it doesn't smack of superb mystery storytelling and filming.The acting is good all around and can't be faulted. Of course, the ruse of the film can raise many questions. Did the hospital use real inmates to role-play with the delusional Teddy Daniels? If so, how could professional health people justify that? If they didn't use real inmates, then they just happened to have many other folks around who would like to role-play in an asylum for the criminally insane.Unfortunately, psycho thrillers of this sort don't have to answer questions like that. Or make any sense at all. Real mysteries should allow people to rely on their senses and common sense otherwise. While I do enjoy such films from time to time, when they go this far off the track of good mystery telling, they go to another genre. They still involve crime but become more horror stories than human drama. And, then, the elements of the story don't have to fit or even make sense.The use of flashbacks seems to be the modern Hollywood and fiction writers' technique for getting around the historical tenets of good writing and storytelling. So, plot, plot, plot (as in solid story development) becomes plod, plod, plod (as in toss things together and hurry them along to be done with it). Give me a good old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Dashiell Hammett mystery any day.",4,1,3,10 January 2019
Interstellar," Updated Space Odyssey is the best space sci-fi of the new century so far
","As of 2017, 'Interstellar' is the best sci-fi space film of the 21st century. It was nearly 50 years since the first major film involving time travel and crossing dimensions in space. I wondered when someone would again pick up on the idea presented in the 1968 blockbuster, '2001: A Space Odyssey.' 'Interstellar' has that and more. It holds one's interest, even though the premise for the dying, over- populated earth was outmoded by the early 21st century. Low birth rates in all of the developed countries are projected to lead to population declines. Deaths will outpace births in most countries well before the mid-21st century. This is a departure from the more common alien creatures of sci-fi films. I do enjoy those type of films more. They are no more far- fetched than the notions of traveling back or forward in time. This film does a good job of trying to put credence to many theories. But, the film's 'science' about time dilation, quantum gravity and wormholes is probably over the heads of 99.99 percent of viewers. One of the nice things about sci-fi is that it doesn't have to make sense. Aspects can be outlandish, bizarre and inconceivable. After all, that's what makes it fictional in the realm of science. The cast in this film all give good performances. The space scenes are very good as are all technical aspects and production values of the movie. I don't rate it any higher than seven because it doesn't provide the excitement or edge of seat anxiety that other sci-fi films provide. One should never take these films, or their plots too seriously. They are entertaining fiction, period.",7,0,1,8 August 2017
Notting Hill," Fairy tale romance is just so-so
","'Notting Hill' is sort of a fairy tale romance. Of course, the initial appeal would be the two stars, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Grant plays William Thacker who owns a travel bookshop and lives nearby in the Notting Hill district of London. Roberts plays Anna Scott, the world's most famous actress for this story. They happen to meet when Anna just happens into his bookshop one day. The screen idol is trying to get away, to duck out of her life for a while. This eventually blossoms into a romance, and that leads to a fairy tale ending. Grant is the main star of this movie, and the main reason to see it. He wrestles with the unlikelihood of his encounter. He's attracted to Scott, and the thought of anything serious is too unbelievable. But, it's happening and he's there, and he needs to pursue it. That sums up the good and interesting parts of this movie. Roberts doesn't have many lines in this film. At times, Anna just seems to be a pretty face or fixture. Some of the film surrounds the actress and her entourage – a secretary, manager, publicist and reporters and photographers. Her life seems tightly regulated and scheduled. I think the audience is meant to sympathize with the heroine who can't have any time of her own, away from the spotlight, news cameras, and public. It's hard to empathize, though, when Anna makes $15 million just for one movie. She tells Bernie (played by Hugh Bonneville) that's what she is paid. So, make three or four films in a year, and that's $45 to $60 million a year. It's hard to sympathize with that. Of course, money isn't everything – and really not that much, when it comes down to happiness in life. But, what this film shows, probably not intentionally, is that those who make a fortune in the limelight (obviously, not all super wealthy folks), aren't very happy. Or, they have a hard time finding happiness. That's because the money, the limelight, the notoriety get in the way. Imparting that message, however subliminally, may be a quality of this film that most won't see or realize. It may get lost in the dream romance.The best parts of the film are when William takes Anna to a family dinner with his two sisters, brother-in-law and family friend. The family add the most zest and some good comedy to the film. Gina McKee is Bella, William's older sister. Richard McCabe is Tony, her devoted husband, gourmet cook and witty humorist. Emma Chambers is the youngest sister, Honey. Family friend, Bernie, rounds out the group. Toward the end, this group comes together to help William get to the depot on time.This group had been trying to find a match for William. So, they repeatedly had dinners at Bella and Tony's with a date they would line up for William. Naturally, none worked out, and most were far out. One of the strangest was a funny but somber match. Tony had just fixed a gourmet meal that they are about to eat and she announces that she is a fruitarian. She says, 'We believe fruits and vegetable have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel. We only eat things that have already fallen from the tree or bush that are, in fact, dead already.' William, 'Oh, all right. So, these carrots?' Date, 'Have been murdered, yes.'Rhys Ifans who plays Spike, an out-of-work roommate of William, adds very little to this film. His character seems to be intended for the humor, but there's not much. Mostly he's a coarse slob who sponges off William. He lounges around the flat most of the day in his skivvies. The film was shot in the Notting Hill district. I'm not familiar with London, but this seems like a nice residential area not far from the heart of London, to the Northwest. Of course, residential areas in such places are mixed with, or adjacent to, stretches of commerce and government. It's not far from Kensington Palace (museum) and Hyde Park. The little that the film has on the streets is a nice peek at life in London neighborhoods. It's hard to imagine though, that a bloke could make a go of it in a neighborhood bookshop that just handled travel books. This film will probably be enjoyed most by the lovelorn and those who like to fantasize about romance or the perfect match. But for the most part, it's just so-so. Hugh Grant's part is good, and his family members and scenes are the most fun. Julia Roberts is mostly a pretty face. The trivia section of the IMDb Web site says that she wanted terribly to play this part, it was such a wonderful love story. Well, she forgot to bring her pep pills to put some life into her character. Another interesting bit of trivia is that Roberts made $15 million for this film. So, she accounted for 36% of the $42 million budget. Incidentally, a number of Hollywood stars have been paid $20 to $35 million or more for single films. Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves, Johnny Depp, Bruce Williams, Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, Sara Jessica Parker, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and a host of others get many millions for a single film. Some also take smaller salaries but get percentages of the profits. In some instances, that has made them more than $100 million – for a single film.",5,0,0,28 January 2017
Léon: The Professional," Light dialog, far out plot, and wild mayhem don't make a good movie
","'Leon: The Professional' is a French-made film with a story that takes place in New York City. The simple plot for this film is a good one. It's a variation on any number of stories in which a woman or man take in a child who has lost her or his parents. This one has some unusual variations that set it apart from the others. Mostly, they make it a far out film and unbelievable film. The acting is good by most of the cast, but nothing exceptional. There is minimal dialog, especially between the two main characters, Leon and Mathilda. Jean Reno plays Leon, and Natalie Portman is Mathilda. Leon is a sociopath who makes a living killing people. He doesn't have a thread of conscience. He is antisocial throughout. Mathilda is 12 years old. She was abused by her parents and their various live-in friends. Her family was 
highly dysfunctional. Indeed, it doesn't resemble a traditional family at all. The only person she felt close to was her four-year-old brother. After drug dealers kill her family, Mathilda has a sense of hurt and loss for her brother. That festers into a desire for revenge. Leon was taken in as a teenager when he came to America as a refugee after his parents were killed in Italy. Tony is a mafia boss who took Leon under his wing and started him on the road to killing as a professional hit man. Leon is illiterate, and Tony arranges special hits for him and keeps his money. The story takes place in New York City, around the neighborhood of Little Italy. Leon and Mathilda lived in the same building. He takes her in reluctantly after her family is killed. When she discovers that he is a professional killer, she prods him to teach her tricks of the trade. One other far out aspect of the plot is that the head drug dealer is also a major leader of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). It appears that his whole staff are in on the deal and nothing but a bunch of wanton killers. Add to that what seems to be a completely corrupt New York police force, and this is a wildly unbelievable scenario. The director and writer expects the audience to believe that the entire law enforcement body in the New York area was crooked, and unconscionable drug handlers and killers. And that no one else in law enforcement would be wise to that fact. The way these guys move around, wildly wield their weapons, and push people around makes it seem like mob mayhem. This film flies in the face of more realistic films about the underworld of drugs. The one performance that stands out is Gary Oldman as Stansfield, the DEA boss. Yet, his character is so unbelievably narcissistic, that it's inconceivable that he wouldn't be noticed by others. This film closely resembles the mayhem madness of sci-fi or fantasy films set in the future when society is mostly lawless. For the portrayal of Leon's clever techniques and the small affection and friendship that blossoms between Leon and Mathilda, this film scores five stars. With a better and more realistic scripting of the DEA and law raids, and a better screenplay overall, it might have reached a level worthy of seven stars. There is nothing artistic about this film. It has no outstanding performances. The screenplay isn't that good. It seems to be little more than a tribute to violence and promoter of revenge - hardly noteworthy attributes of the silver screen.",5,1,2,23 August 2018
The Italian Job," Modern technical version of original film
","This Paramount film is a remake of the 1969 movie of the same name that was a very good comedy caper. This 2003 version of 'The Italian Job' doesn't measure up to the first film, but it is entertaining in its own right. This film is sans the comedy, and in place of that with the clever scheming in the original, this second rendition is all modern. That means lots of technical, electronic, mechanical, scientific caper stuff. I do enjoy these films, but find that they tend to be awful formulaic absent a good and different plot. The highly technical aspects of some films render them almost sci-fi movies. This one is an example. While the final plan of this plot may be technically feasible (very doubtful at that), it's so implausible that it is more sci-fi than crime caper. Of course, that makes it more of an action thriller as well. The cast are a quite good. Donald Sutherland isn't on screen very long. Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron play their roles very well. The rest of the cast fit their roles to a T. The film location scenes in Venice and the Alps are beautiful, and reminiscent of having been to those places. The crowded Los Angeles streets and scenes are Â… Los Angeles. This is an enjoyable action film to watch, but there's not much suspense to it. Be sure to watch the 1969 film that stars Michael Caine, Noel Coward, Benny Hill and Raf Valone.",7,1,1,15 May 2015
The Caine Mutiny," Great book, screenplay, acting and film
","Although it's fiction, 'The Caine Mutiny' is a highly realistic portrayal of the U.S. Navy, its men, and the stress of command during World War II. It's based on a book of the same name by Herman Wouk. He served on minesweepers in the Pacific theater during WW II. The role of Fred MacMurray somewhat resembles Wouk and his service. MacMurray is a writer working on a novel in his spare time on ship. How much else the character resembles Wouk is anyone's guess. Navy veterans have praised Wouk's work for his honest and accurate portrayal of life at sea during WW II, and for his variety of characters. Wouk wrote a number of popular novels in later years, several of which were made into movies. Among them were 'Marjorie Morningstar' in 1955, 'Slattery's Hurricane' in 1956, and 'Youngblood Hawke' in 1961. His two greatest works were historical fictions that were made into mini-series films for TV. 'Winds of War,' and 'War and Remembrance' won multiple awards and recognition worldwide in the 1980s. 'The Caine Mutiny' is an excellent study of characters. The only other film of 1954 that has such depth of character development and study is the one that took the biggest honors for the year – 'On the Waterfront.' But, 'The Caine Mutiny' is a classic film that should be in all war movie collections and all other serious film collections. It is one of half a dozen films that show Humphrey Bogart's great talent as an actor. Bogart gave an Oscar-worthy performance in the lead role as Philip Francis Queeg, captain of the Caine. The screenplay, direction and supporting cast for this film all were outstanding. Indeed, the cast of this film was near perfect for so many prominent roles. Only that of Ensign Willie Keith, was weak. Newcomer Robert Francis was stiff and seemed to have stage fright in his part. One could image a young Paul Newman (27 or 28 then) giving a more genuine portrayal in that role. But the Mutiny cast doesn't end there. Veteran stars José Ferrer and E.G. Marshall have noteworthy roles. Other veterans have very good parts – Steve Brodie as Chief Budge and Warner Anderson as Capt. Blakely. And some up-and-comers have sizable parts and play them very well – Lee Marvin as Meatball, Claude Akins as Lugatch, May Wynn as May, and Jerry Paris as Ensign Barney Harding. As with all the years in the decade of the 50s, 1954 had many very good to excellent movies. But two films and their associated roles stood out. 'Mutiny' with Bogart and others was one, and 'On the Waterfront' starring Marlon Brando with others is the second. 'Waterfront' was best picture and Brando won the Oscar for best actor. 'Mutiny' and Bogart were nominated. 'Waterfront' won 8 of its 12 nominations, but 'Mutiny' didn't capture a single Oscar in its 7 nominations. There's no doubt that Brando gave an Oscar performance in 'Waterfront.' But was his performance better than Bogart's in 'Mutiny?' I don't dwell on speculation about the Academy Awards. No doubt, there are sentimental favorites at times. And other things may affect the academy voting as well. History has recorded some years when studios spent lavishly to influence the academy voters. And, perhaps chicanery has been at play in some years. I wonder if that wasn't the case in 1954. I'll grant the Brando-Bogart nominations a toss-up. But the nominations of supporting actors must raise the eyebrows of serious movie buffs. 'Waterfront' received three nominations for best supporting actor – Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden and Rod Steiger. All gave deserving performances. 'Mutiny' received one nomination – Tom Tully. While his role was very good, it was a lesser role than two other exceptional performances who were not nominated. Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray were outstanding in their roles as Lt. Steve Maryk and Lt. Tom Keefer, respectively. They were at least as good as the performances by the three 'Waterfront' nominations. So, might there have been some chicanery afoot in the Academy echelon that chose the nominees to be voted upon? How could two such exceptional roles be overlooked, where they chose to nominate a somewhat lesser role from the same film?Whatever skullduggery may have been at work, one wonders if the Academy voters didn't see through it or decide enough is enough. Not to take anything away from Edmond O'Brien for his very good role in 'The Barefoot Contessa,' but the voters may have picked him best supporting actor to snub the Academy for its choice of nominees – or lack of some obviously deserving nominees in this category. Bur for 'On the Waterfront,' Paramount's 'The Caine Mutiny' likely would have garnered three Oscars of its seven nominations in 1954. Bogart also starred in two other films that year – 'The Barefoot Contessa' and 'Sabrina,' both of which did very well at the box office. Incidentally, while 'Waterfront' topped the Oscar honors, 'Mutiny' beat it soundly at the box office. 'Waterfront' tied for 14th at the box office in 1954. It had $4.5 million in ticket sales, with a budget just under $1 million. But 'Mutiny' was a respectable fifth in gross box office for the year. It earned $21.8 million in the U.S. alone on an estimated $2 million budget. The top film for the year was 'White Christmas,' with a box office of $30 million. The others of the top five were '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,' with $28.2 million; 'Rear Window' at $27.6 million; and 'Demetrius and the Gladiator,' at $26 million. Only one other film topped $10 million that year – 'Vera Cruz,' an MGM Western that grossed $11 million.",10,0,1,30 July 2014
The Color of Money," Newman finally gets his Oscar
","With seven Academy Award nominations, it appeared that Paul Newman, at age 60, might end his career in the ranks of top Hollywood entertainers never to have won an Oscar. In his case, it included leading actor roles in six films and as director of one. Five of the acting roles and his only director nomination were up against stiff competition. But, he won the best actor Oscar for this 1986 film. Never mind that it was a year with not much competition for best actor. But for Ben Kingsley's 'Gandhi' in 1982, Newman would have won an Oscar that year for his role in 'The Verdict.'Newman is very good as Fast Eddie Felson. 'The Color of Money' is very good but nowhere near great, as are some other films of 1986 – 'Platoon,' 'The Mission,' 'A Room with a View.' But only one actor from those top films was nominated for best actor (William Hurt, for 'Children of a Lesser God'). Except for Hurt's film, the others with best actor nominations were all lesser known films of the year. The performances by the best actor nominees probably was very good, but without any other big names from big films, this might just have been a year when the Academy made a sentimental choice. The film also stars a very young Tom Cruise who, in just the past couple of years had scored a couple of blockbuster films. So, he clearly was on his way to stardom and top billing, very soon. The rest of the cast are fine in this film. It's a movie about pool shooting. It has some nice moments of drama, but otherwise drags a little in places. Naturally, there's a considerable amount of time showing pool games. Those who like to play pool or billiards should enjoy this film. Most of those who don't care for pool probably will find the movie slow or boring.It's nice that Paul Newman won his Oscar for this film. He was a top entertainer for a few decades – though not one of the great actors, or best entertainers. He was one of the best humanitarians, and many fans appreciated him as much for his genuine charity and goodwill. See this film if you like to shoot pool, or like Paul Newman or Tom Cruise. Otherwise, don't go out of your way to watch or buy it.",6,0,0,6 September 2017
Trouble with the Curve," One of the better baseball scouting films
","'Trouble with the Curve' is one of the best movies made to date about baseball scouting. There have been a few over the years. But as with sports films in general, those are mostly on the high end with lots of glitter. This film shows much more of what must be the mundane life of scouts who drive from town to town and stay in mom and pop motels. They do this week after week to watch and check out ball players.Clint Eastwood stars as an aging scout whose future looms as one in retirement. He doesn't want to quit, and has wisdom in spotting players strengths and weaknesses. That only comes from experience. His job in scouting a possible first place pick for the Atlanta Braves is being challenged by a younger, whiz-kid computer jockey who goes by the stats of the electronic media.Eastwood's Gus has a daughter whose upbringing was dysfunctional. But Mickey has made good in a legal career. For many years, her dad took her on scouting trips, and she is a baseball nut as well. Now she leaves her work with a big case facing her, to be with her dad. One can guess where this will go, with romance entering the picture.This is an enjoyable and satisfying sports movie and family drama. It's one of the first films Eastwood has made in a number of years that he didn't also direct. His roles of an older man, which he is in real life, have become predictable in his impatience and irascibility. That's beginning to wear a little thin.",7,1,1,15 November 2018
Bridge of Spies," Good film of Cold War true events
","'Bridge of Spies' is a first rate film about three true events that occurred at the height of the Cold War (1946-1991). They were headline news stories of their day. The first two incidents were unrelated but were tied together by the third event. Director Steven Spielberg and the writing team had a tough job condensing three stories over five years into a film of less than 2½ hours. They had to skip much detail, and the film seems crammed in places. Some things may not be apparent to one who doesn't know the history. The first event was the 1957 New York arrest, trial and conviction of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. The second event was the 1960 crash of an American spy plane over Russia and the arrest, trial and conviction of the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. The third event was the 1962 prisoner exchange of the two men, along with a second American. The first and last of these three events involve a third principal character, James Donovan, a New York attorney. The film revolves around Donovan and his role in the lives of the captive men. All of the cast are superb in their roles. The film naturally had Hollywood treatment, so some parts are fiction. Folks interested in the Cold War, or in espionage, or Soviet spying in particular, might enjoy more details. So, I offer some here from my study of these subjects. Rudolf Abel was one of many aliases of Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (1903-1971). Fisher was an English-born Russian. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, served in the military and became a Soviet intelligence officer. After World War II, he joined the KGB and was trained to spy in the U.S. He left Russia in 1948. Using different IDs and passports, he made his way across Europe to Canada and then the U.S. on Nov. 17. He operated in a spy ring under the code name, Mark. When things heated up, he was about to leave the U.S. with a new ID. But, he was arrested before he could leave. That was June 21, 1957.The film gives a sense of intrigue with Abel's capture. It didn't happen the way the movie portrays it. He answered the door in his hotel room and was arrested by FBI agents. But the scenes with a hollow nickel were one way to bring into the story a real aspect that led to Abel's capture. In 1953, a Brooklyn newspaper boy received a hollow nickel for payment when he was collecting for his paper route. He dropped the coin and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm. It wound up in the hands of the FBI. In time, through trailing other known Soviet spies, and the defection of one in May of 1957, the feds were able to corral Abel. The federal court in New York convicted him of spying and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He had served just over four years in an Atlanta prison, when he was exchanged in 1962 for Gary Powers. Back home in Russia, Fisher lectured on his experiences until he died at age 68 in 1971.Francis Gary Powers (1929-1977) was a U.S. Air Force jet pilot during 1952-56. He was discharged from the Air Force as a captain in 1956, and went to work for the CIA to fly U-2 missions over the Soviet Union. Those began on Sept. 27, 1956 and continued into 1960. On May 1 of that year, Powers was shot down by a new Soviet ground to air missile, and parachuted to safety. On Aug. 19, the Soviet Union convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to three years in prison and seven years of hard labor. He served just over 21 months in prison before the February 10, 1962 exchange. The movie doesn't show it, but the Powers family and two American attorneys were at his trial.In later years, Powers received honors for his service. Soviet records released after the fall of the Iron Curtain verified the details Power had given of his U-2 flight. Powers died on Aug. 1, 1977 when his TV traffic helicopter crashed in Los Angeles. While making an emergency landing, he swerved to avoid hitting children playing in a park. James Donovan (1916-1970) took the Abel case after several others had turned it down. He had been in a private law firm just seven years after serving as a commander in the Navy. During World War II, he was associate counsel in a research and development office. After the war, he was assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson, the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials in Germany. Donovan was the main negotiator in the prisoner exchange of Abel and Powers, which also included an American student, Frederic Pryor. While the movie doesn't cover it, Donovan's efforts that same year and the next for Cuban exiles were as harrowing as his negotiations with the Soviets. In June, exiled Cubans asked him to negotiate the release of the Cuban Americans captured by Fidel Castro after the failed April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The negotiations concluded on July 3, 1963, and led to the release of about 1,100 people. Donovan was just 53 years old when he died of a heart attack in January 1970. A 1976 TV movie was made about Gary Powers. Lee Majors starred in 'Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident.' A 1948 movie, 'The Iron Curtain,' stars Dana Andrews as Igor Gouzenko. He was a Soviet crypto clerk who defected and exposed a massive spy network in Canada and the U.S. The Soviets were way ahead of the U.S. in their espionage work after WW II and during the early years of the Cold War.",9,0,1,11 July 2017
Doctor Zhivago," Epic film banned by the Soviet Union and Nobel Prize declined
","'Doctor Zhivago' is an epic film of love, hope and tragedy, based on the novel by Nobel laureate Boris Pasternak. It spans nearly four decades and sweeps across a vast expanse of central Russia from Moscow to east of the Ural Mountains. It covers the end times of Czarist Russia, the rise of the Bolshevik revolution, the communist takeover and the early years of the Soviet Union. Yet, it is not a war, revolution, or military movie. It is a love story set in those times, events and places. It is a love story wound in and around those real events that Boris Pasternak lived through as a young man in Russia.Zhivago, played by Omar Sharif, is a doctor, a poet, a gentle soul and a lover of life, people and all things created. We see his love of life in the long shots of his looking at and reflecting on fields of flowers, a snow-covered countryside, marching students and workers, or peasants standing in the icy remains of their burned down village. We see Zhivago's love for two women, played by Geraldine Chaplin and Julie Christie. We see his inner conflict over this, and how events that unfold contribute to the conflict. The story is told in flashbacks by his brother, played by Alec Guinness.Many people have written reviews on this great movie. But I wonder how many older viewers remember the controversy surrounding the author, book and movie. Or, how many younger viewers are aware of the history of 'Doctor Zhivago.' How many people know that Pasternak had to reject the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958? The Soviet Union wouldn't allow the book to be published. When it was printed outside the U.S.S.R., the Soviet's banned the book throughout the realm. When the movie came out in 1965, the Soviets banned it from being shown in the U.S.S.R. It wasn't until after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the book was translated into Russian and sold in the former U.S.S.R. The first showing of the movie in Russia was in 1994.Boris Pasternak (1890-1960) was a poet and author who lived his entire life in Russia. His first poems were published in 1917, but by 1930 he was no longer able to print what he wrote. He began working secretly on 'Doctor Zhivago' as a novel based on much of his own experiences. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, he was able to finish the book. But he was told it was unfit for publication in Russia. So, he smuggled the manuscript out, and it was first published in Italian in 1957 by a publisher in Italy. It was soon printed in 30 different languages. But not Russian! The following year, the Nobel Committee picked Pasternak to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, and invited him to Stockholm, Sweden, to accept the award. But he declined the prize in worldwide publicity that proved very embarrassing to the Soviet Union. The Soviets forbade Pasternak's reentry into Russia if he went to Stockholm to receive the prize. Pasternak had a deep love for his country and didn't want to live in exile, so he publicly refused the award. In his note to the Nobel committee, he explained that he was not critical of the committee, but that he had to decline. He wrote: 'In light of the significance this award carries in the society in which I live, I must denounce the undeserved prize which was awarded to me. Please do not be offended by my voluntary refusal.''Doctor Zhivago' won five Oscars and had five other Academy Award nominations. That was in a year that was filled with great competition from a number of superb films. It also received five Golden Globes. This is a great movie, indeed. It excels in all aspects of its production – form the screenplay and direction, to the costumes and sets, to the cinematography and scenery, to the superb musical score, to the outstanding performances by a host of actors. And, on an end note, it's also a good historical film – for the period and events it portrays in history, and for the history surrounding the author, book and movie.",10,1,2,18 September 2012
American Beauty," Not a fan of dysfunctional mayhem
","This is a story about a very dysfunctional guy in a very dysfunctional family. Some others in his neighborhood also fit the bill. Even Lester Burnham's (Kevin Spacey) acquaintances are screwed up. There may be some satire of American lifestyles in suburbia. And, it may be a sadly realistic portrayal of some of Western culture of the early 21st century, which was dawning. But mostly, it's just about a dysfunctional group of people with no seeming aim or purpose in life. So they exist for fleeting pleasure of things, their self-centered interests, and sexual promiscuity. I don't find this stuff entertaining. 'American Beauty' is anything but beauty. Hollywood may call it art, but I think it's more closely art spelled backwards with an 'sh' on the end. Obviously, I'm in a minority of views about this film. That this movie won a fistful of Oscars and other awards just tells how far Hollywood has fallen from its days of great movie-making. In a word, this movie is more smut than good drama.",3,1,4,14 December 2017
The Alamo," Accurate battle scenes, but a flat film otherwise
","The filmmakers went to great effort and expense to have a definitively accurate movie about the Alamo. The Alamo fort, dress and military uniforms, weapons, livestock, and setting were reproduced exactly to the 1830s. But, while this 2004 film may have hit the mark as the most historically accurate, it loses out in appeal and interest otherwise. The loss is in a very weak script, mostly bland characters and poor acting. There are likely accurate records of the Alamo defense, Santa Ana's deployments and the battle and defeat from accounts of survivors. Among those were the messengers sent out, Mrs. Dickinson, Joe, and others who left before the battle. But there was no written record of the dialog and discussions between the main characters and others. So, this is all fiction, as it is in most films. And the fiction in this movie is mostly dull and lifeless. The script had no energy, emotion or passion. Then, there is the cast. I'm not one for picking on directors and producers for 'miscasting' actors, but this movie tempts me to make an exception. Only one role stands out in this film – that of Santa Ana by Emilio Echevarria. He did an excellent job with an interesting piece of script. But, after him, all the rest of the principals fall flat. I have seen Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton in some very good roles. But they are terrible in this film. Again, it may be partly due to the bad script and poorly imagined dialog. Except for some snarls from Jason Patric, there's nothing to remember about James Bowie from this movie. Patrick Wilson is fair as Travis, but is just too young for the part. Quaid over-acts with most of his lines, and when he doesn't have a line or word to speak, even his grimaces and frowns seem forced and unnatural. This is the worst I have ever seen him in any film. The biggest goof, I think, is in the character of Davy Crocket, and Thornton's portrayal. Except for the one short scene demonstrating his expert marksmanship, Davy Crockett comes across in this film as a wimp. There's nothing in this role that suggests a pioneering woodsman, adventurer, or frontier hero. Indeed, the filmmakers instead wrote a character who apologizes for his exaggerated image of folklore. So, they wrote a 21st century apology or correction into a story taking place in the early 19th century. Sure, we know that there were many overly- inflated tales about Crockett then. But did the real Davy Crockett go around meekly apologizing for the made-up image of him? I can't understand the filmmakers casting Thornton as Crockett – especially since they wanted to be as accurate as possible. Thornton doesn't fit the 'build.' Crockett had a large frame and was a tall man. The Davy Crockett Almanac and Book of Lists (2000, by William R. Chemerka), gives a description of Crockett as 'about six feet tall and 200 pounds, no surplus flesh, broad shouldered, stood erect, of great physical strength, fine appearance, swarthy complexion' In the early 1800s, the average male height in the U.S. was about 5 feet, 7 inches. That would have made Crockett stand over most other men by 5 inches. A tall man, indeed. While Thornton is 6 feet tall today, the average height is 5 feet, 11 inches to 6 feet. So, he's about average; and in the film, many of the players around him were taller and bigger. The role called for someone in the range of 6 feet and 4 to 5 inches. The 1960s John Wayne Alamo seemed to be more accurate in the physical proportions of its cast. One last historical sidestep in the movie has to do with the end of the battle. A few months before the Alamo, Texans had defeated the Mexican army and driven it out of Texas. The Mexican soldiers apparently were wary of the determined and feisty Texans who were defending their land. So, as the last of the Alamo defenders fell, the Mexican officers couldn't restrain their troops who walked among the fallen defenders and continued shooting and bayoneting the bodies. Perhaps that would be a little too much realism or accuracy to show in a film that appears to be a 'feel-good' tale about the past.",6,1,2,2 November 2013
Duck Soup," The silliest but far from best Marx Brothers movie
","The Marx Brothers were among the best comedy entertainers of their time and beyond. They were gifted musicians as well as comedians. Their comedy included dialog with one-liners and zingers, zany antics, slapstick and acrobatics. Some of their movies are among the funniest and best comedies of all time. Many sources regard 'Duck Soup' as their best film. I don't, and here's why. This film was still early in their movie careers and strikes me as raw and unpolished. It has many lines and routines that seem right out of vaudeville. Indeed, the long scenes with the peanut vending come from a vaudeville act that the brothers recreate in a couple of movies. There's nothing wrong with the variety performances of vaudeville, except that today they are old hat and just not as funny. And many of the one- liners are so old that they too lack humor today. The long scenes of costumed players singing the Freedonia anthem lose their humor after the first one or two. 'Duck Soup' seems to me to be a succession of skits held together by the thinnest of plots. Plots aren't necessary for great comedy, but then the comedy must be able to stand on its own. I just don't think 'Duck Soup' has the comedy that does that. One last thing that bothers me about this film is the insult in some of Groucho's lines. It goes overboard here. As an aside, this is one of the few of the brothers' big films in which they don't perform musically. Their musical talents were surely of professional level and when they played in their other films, they added a little something to the story – and even to the mayhem at times. I rate 'A Night at the Opera' as the best Marx Brothers film, and one of the greatest comedies of all time. Close behind it is 'A Day at the Races.' Those films differ considerably from 'Duck Soup' in that they have interesting serious plots that make for much more laughter with the zany scenes. And, they have much better developed dialog with witty lines and wonderful zingers. In the place of silliness (slaps in the face, verbal insults, etc.) that pepper 'Duck Soup,' those films spend a little time with plot involving other actors. That makes the comedy all the more hilarious in the scenes that follow. 'Duck Soup' may be the silliest movie the Marx Brothers made. But it's not the funniest by a long shot. Nor is it their best, in my view.",5,1,6,24 May 2015
Quantum of Solace," Bond series goes ballistic sci-fi in 'Quantum'
","After a superb revival of the James Bond series with 'Casino Royale' in 2006, this film was a big letdown. About the only connection it has to an Ian Fleming novel about the British MI6 and its secret agents is in the characters in this film. Otherwise, 'Quantum of Solace' resembles a sci-fi film more than it does a spy thriller. The evil enemy here is such a complicated menagerie, that one is constantly trying to keep track of whom is who and what is what. This film follows the trend of the early 21st century. It's an action film with almost constant, non-stop action. This surely holds the record of shootings and killings in Bond films. A number of other quirks stand out. Q and Moneypenny are absent, as is any high tech gimmickry for Bond's use. The exotic places of the usual Bond film are replaces with settings in Haiti and Bolivia. And, M and the entire British intelligence network must be suspect. The sci-fi aspects Include such far-fetched things as huge underground dams to dry up surface water supplies, and massive building complexes and construction in the Atacama Desert of Bolivia. The film would have one believe that such massive works could be undertaken but not be noticed or discovered. So, all the modern sophisticated monitoring devices with satellites wouldn't detect a massive project in a wide-open desert? Construction traffic wouldn't be noticed? Thousands of workers used to build and staff such undertakings would all be hush-hush about their jobs? Other Bond films have some far-fetched plots, but at least MI6 can use modern technology to discover some of their secrets. In its efforts to keep up with the modern craze for constant action in movies, the Bond filmmakers have turned an enjoyable and mystery-action series into a fantasy and sci-fi series. I prefer the subtle, intriguing, espionage thrillers that Ian Fleming wrote for James Bond. Their occasional fast action and thrilling chases were part of more well-rounded plots. The type of uncoordinated mayhem in this film soon wears very thin. Daniel Craig alone earns the five stars for this film for the beating and rough times he shows. After the best of the Bond series in 'Casino Royale,' this film turns out to have the worst plot and screenplay of the entire series.",5,0,1,26 May 2018
Non-Stop," New twist adds suspense and tension to air hijacking plot
","Just when one thinks that plane hijacking and air disaster films have about run their course, Hollywood comes up with a new twist. 'Non-Stop' adds new mystery and tension to this sub-genre of mystery-action thrillers. And a stellar cast delivers plenty of excitement. Liam Neesen is a believable U.S. air marshal, Bill Marks; even if the premise of his dislike or fear of flying is a bit hard to swallow. Julianne Moore is excellent in her role as Jen Summers, a passenger whom Marks trusts, then distrusts, then trusts again. The rest of the cast all deliver top performances. Watching this film, one had a sense of real fear among the many passengers. Perhaps the only weak spot in the film was the organizing of a few male passengers to overcome Marks. It didn't seem quite real – had a stagy feel to it. The cinematography and special effects for this film were outstanding. It has a very taut plot that is well-scripted. It maintains good tension throughout – as a very good mystery-thriller should. And the title is aptly named for the action throughout, as well as for the flight's schedule.",9,0,2,13 September 2014
Zulu," Great film of a spectacular historical event
","When I first saw 'Zulu,' I knew nothing about the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. If we had studied it in school, I didn't remember anything about it. And, I think that's the best place to be for the first time watching this film. It affords the maximum appreciation and enjoyment of the movie. By that, I don't mean enjoyment in the sense of fun, but in having something like a bird's eye view of the events taking place and being there at the time. By not knowing the outcome of an historical event, I think one can better sense being a part of the event taking place on screen.This is a great movie, by any standards. It is a film of an historical event that shows the drama, the tension, the intensity, the fear and courage, the determination, the pathos and the tragedy of the Battle of Rorke's Drift, January 22-23, 1879. It's about the 3,000 to 4,000 Zulus who were fighting to keep a foreign nation from invading their land. Armed mostly with primitive weapons – spears and shields, they dared to go against the British troops and garrisons in South Africa who were moving to invade their kingdom. It's about a small garrison of British soldiers and South African troops who gallantly withstood massive waves of native warriors who outnumbered them better than 20 to 1. It's a film about the thinking and psychology of the leaders of both sides. This is a movie of monumental scale – in its outdoor setting, in the numbers of natives used for extras as Zulu warriors, and in the camera work, filming, action and direction. And, yes, the acting is superb by all of the cast. At the time 'Zulu' was made, only one of the cast was generally recognized around the globe – Jack Hawkins. And his role is a minor one in the film. That may be why 'Zulu' received no major awards, or even nominations. Indeed, 1964 was one of those years of many great films ('Becket,' 'Dr. Strangelove,' 'Mary Poppins,' 'My Fair Lady,' 'Zorba the Greek,' 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown,' 'Seven Days in May,' 'The Night of the Iguana,' 'Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte,' 'Cheyenne Autumn,' and more). But this production, and some of the acting were equal to the award winning films of that year. And, 'Zulu' was a breakout film for Michael Caine. He had been around for several years and had small parts and uncredited appearances in TV and silver screen films. After this, Caine would star or co-star in more than 100 films. Stanley Baker plays Lt. John Chard, Caine plays Lt. Gonville Bromhead, Hawkins plays missionary Otto Witt, and Ulla Jacobsson plays his daughter Margareta. A number of top performances were turned in by actors playing the roles of other soldiers. James Booth is Private Henry Hook, Nigel Green is Sgt. Bourne, Ivor Emmanuel is Pvt. Owen, Paul Daneman is Sgt. Maxfield, and Glynn Edwards is Cpl. Allen. There are more who contributed immensely to this film.In the years since I first saw this film, I have read and studied much more history. This is an excellent movie for any serious film library. The Battle of Rorke's Drift was the second direct engagement between British forces in South Africa and the Zulus. The day before this event took place, a much larger force of British troops, with South African and native troops and several hundred civilians, was attacked by 20,000 Zulus and soundly defeated in the Battle of Isandlwana. Of the 1,800 men in the British force, some 1,300 were killed. That included most of the Europeans, 400 of a Natal Native contingent and some 240 African auxiliaries. Historians estimate that the Zulus lost 1,000 to 2,000 men. The outcome of the Battle of Rorke's Drift would be quite different – with the British garrison of about 155 men holding off the much larger number of Zulus for more than 10 hours of fighting. The Zulus now had some firearms that had been captured from the British the day before, but none were trained in shooting rifles. When the fighting ended and the Zulus withdrew the morning of Jan. 23, the garrison had lost only 16 men killed or mortally wounded, with another 13 wounded. They counted 351 Zulu bodies, and it's estimated that another 500 Zulus were wounded. Many of them were likely captured and killed by the British main force of Lord Chelmsford (Frederic Thesiger). Chelmsford went on to defeat the Zulus on July 4, 1879, in the Battle of Ulundi. As the film notes at the end, 11 men from the Battle of Rorke's Drift were awarded the Victoria Cross, England's highest military honor since the mid-19th century. For the quality of this great film, and the sheer spectacle of the event, 'Zulu' should be an excellent historical reference for decades to come.",10,8,8,8 March 2017
Gone Girl," The holes hold the clues to solving this mystery
","Not having read Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel of this same title, I don't know if the book had plot holes as the movie does. Fellow mystery aficionados know that for every plot hole in a story the writer is omitting or covering up a major clue. And, so this film has some, which leads crime and mystery buffs to suspect what follows.'Gone Girl' is a good murder mystery, but not a great one. It is presented in such a way that audiences won't know right away if there has been a murder. And, it's obviously portrayed so that many will assume that Ben Affleck's Nick Dunne really 'done it.' (I couldn't resist.) Then, it's only a matter of time as the story unravels and viewers see the 'what' and the 'how' of the crime. Aha, but what crime?I don't know if the author or the movie producers were trying to emulate Alfred Hitchcock, but the fright factor here doesn't come close to him. Nor does the suspense equal that of the usual Dashiel Hammett, Agatha Christie or John Grisham mystery. It is apparent very early that Amy Dunne has staged her disappearance to make it look like a killing, probably to get even with Nick. As the story unfolds, it bears that out.None of the performances here are great. Some are very good - Rosamund Pike as Amy, Carrie Coon as Nick's sister, Margo, and Tyler Perry as attorney Tanner Bolt. The rest of the cast were fair to good except for Affleck. He was lifeless and underplayed his role terribly. One suspects that was intended by the director to further build suspicion of him. I just saw him as lazy, and bored stiff.While one can see the deception very early, the second plot and murder of Desi Collings is a surprise. The end to the story isn't clear, so that keeps the suspense going.Some other reviewers have noted the portrayals of the frenzied crowds, in response to the social media craze and modern news media that tend to be in one's face. That's a good thing to highlight. The ending doesn't bring the story to closure as endings should. In that also, 'Gone Girl' doesn't belong with the good mysteries of the masters named above. Hitchcock or Hammett could wrap up the mystery and still leave readers and viewers with a question or two. But, they always saw that justice was served, one way or another. Not so, though, in this film.Detective Rhonda Boney was very competent as a crime investigator. That is, up to the point of the plot holes. And, those are where Amy's ruse would quickly have unraveled. Here are just the most obvious ones. The first is the car Amy is driving. Was it her car, and if so, why were the police not looking for it? If it was a car she just bought or rented, she would have had to stash it some place where she could get to it quickly. And she would have had to pay for it. The car company people would have recognized her face from all the later publicity.The second big hole, which the movie doesn't really show but talks a lot about, is the huge store of goods that Nick was supposed to have bought. When and how did Amy get all that stuff past Nick and stored in their garage and his father's house? How many people might have seen her hauling the stuff there over a few weeks? If she had bought the stuff in person, police checks would have nailed her. The golf pro or store clerk who sells a fancy set of golf clubs is not going to soon forget the person who made such a purchase. And, Nick didn't golf so no one would ever have seen him golfing. Likewise for anyone using someone else's credit card over the telephone.Among other holes would be the tapes at Desi Collings's home that would have shown them arriving and being normal. Amy would have had to somehow erase those. And competent police would wonder why they were erased?What was the very clue that Amy was not murdered but had planned the 'crime?' It was the police finding the envelope marked Clue One. That told one that Nick did not know about that note before their anniversary, and that Amy had left it as she always did for a treasure hunt on their anniversary.Those not satisfied with the ending might imagine any number of future horrors living with the psychotic Amy who says she is now going to have a baby. What of that poor baby or toddler the first time he or she upsets Amy? But, as the film actually ends, it invites an obvious closure that would be classic Hitchcock.Remember Greta and Jeff who robbed Amy of all her money? Greta had sat with 'Nancy,' watching all the TV coverage of Amy's disappearance. She knew Amy was hiding out and had phony glasses. When she and Jeff run out of money, she will have a nice story to tell a newspaper about remembering that woman in the Ozarks. Or, if she and Jeff get in trouble with the law, she can plea-bargain by telling about that gal from the motel who was on the run with a wad of dough. She was always watching the TV coverage and commenting about the missing Amy Dunne.Hitchcock would have a final scene as the credits role. So, the psychotic nymphomaniac, Amy, would come to justice. Greta dials the phone in a phone booth. She starts to speak, 'About that Amy Dunne who said she was kidnapped and raped...' and the sound fades as the camera pulls back and the credits roll.",6,6,8,1 March 2019
Amadeus," Great film about a great composer and time in musical history
","A lot of writing isn't necessary to praise a great film, and 'Amadeus' is just that. The novel approach used in this film works beautifully. A major character in the plot tells the story of Mozart and his great music. F. Murray Abraham plays the Italian composer Antonio Salieri wonderfully. It is through his eyes that the story is told.Abraham won the best actor Oscar in 1984 over the film's co-star, Tom Hulce, who also was nominated for best actor. Hulce's performance as Wolfgang Mozart was as good - even better than was Abraham's role. This was not the first time that two leading players in the same film have been nominated for the same award. It is a rare occasion, and even a much rarer one when both of the leads give outstanding performances. It's too bad that the Motion Picture Academy couldn't make a double award in such cases.'Amadeus' is a delight for many reasons. The best, of course, is the music. Parts of many great Mozart works are played throughout the film. That makes this great film as much an enjoyable listening experience as it is a wonderful story to watch. All aspects of the movie excel - from the detail in the cultural settings and costumes, to the camera and film production.Any such biopic will naturally be fictitious, especially with the many incidental details in a subject's life. Perhaps the biggest aspect of fiction in this film, though, has to do with Salieri. The film clearly shows him as a much less auspicious composer than Mozart. But Salieri had a major career and influence on opera of his day. He was a renowned and talented composer, conductor and teacher who wrote operas in three languages. He held a number of key music posts. Even though he stopped writing music by middle age, he had several famous pupils, including Beethoven, Schubert and Liszt.Salieri's music did fade into oblivion within a few decades. And Mozart's continued to soar in performance and popularity. But with this film, Salieri's music enjoyed a revival in the classical world.There may have been some rivalry felt by Salieri toward Mozart. And there likely was some envy over Mozart's talent. But there just as likely was a modicum of professional respect between the two men. Although few could match the musical genius of Mozart in creating masterful works in his time, many accomplished conductors and players performed his music. Salieri was among them.This film is a delight. One can't help but wonder how much more great music the world might have had if Mozart had lived beyond his youthful age of 35. The movie is a must for any serious film library.",10,0,0,28 December 2018
Ghostbusters," Comedy film spoofing with the spooks
","Comedians Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis have fun in this 1984 film as 'Ghostbusters.' They are booted out of Columbia University where they've had their own parapsychology research office. Murray's Dr. Peter Venkman is some sort of bogus parapsychologist. He plays at tests to study telepathy and similar mental games. But, he's mostly interested in female students. Aykroyd's Dr. Raymond Stantz and Ramis's Dr. Egon Spengler, on the other hand, are into the paranormal. That's the realm of the unknown outside of science. But unlike the psych field, things here can be seen in real life. Venkman is mostly clueless to their work, but he goes along with it. So, they go into the business of catching ghosts. The team invents a trap to contain or imprison ghosts they catch. They have proton weapons that sort of lasso ghosts electrically or by their zapping energy. Venkman is more interested in pursuing Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett. who becomes a client.
 
For comedies such as this, one doesn't have to question the fact that there wasn't such a business before because there was no apparent problem. While the para designation says it's outside of science, Stantz and Spengler have made it a science of studying the para field. All of this contributes to the comedy. The humor isn't in clever, witty dialog, but in rapid-fire nonsensical stuff about the paranormal. And, in some satire and the antics of the Ghostbuster squad as it tangles with ghosts. A fourth ghost fighter joins them. Erne Hudson plays Winston Zeddmore. The various ghosts are mostly funny caricatures. The best comedy is provided in the spoofing jabs of the mayor of New York City, city government, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. William Atherton plays Walter Peck, an EPA honcho who shuts down the Ghostbuster's power supply that keeps its huge collection of jailed ghosts confined. Pandemonium results, and the guys become the heroes of the city for shutting down organized spookery. This is an enjoyable fantasy and sci-fi comedy. It was deserving of the two Oscar nominations it received - for best visual effects and best original song. Toward the end, the ghost fighters encounter their biggest challenge. This is approaching the demonic, and the scenes could be scary for young viewers.",8,1,1,23 June 2018
The Longest Day," One of the best WW II historical and action films
","'The Longest Day' may be the best historical film ever made about World War II in Europe. It has plenty of action. It gives a wonderful picture, from both sides, of the invasion of Normandy on D-Day. The Allies are anxious and restless as they wait in England for the word to go on June 6, 1944. The Germans are reticent and uncertain, knowing that an invasion was imminent. But when? Where? Finally, all the parts of Operation Overlord play out.The largest armada in the history of the world set sail – more than 5,000 vessels headed across the English Channel for the coast of France. Shortly after midnight, more than 13,000 American paratroops take off for a night jump in the largest airborne assault in history to that time.Few of the Allies met their objectives the first day. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their target sites. Americans met Germans entrenched with artillery and machine guns on cliffs high above Omaha and Utah beaches. At Gold, Juno and Sword beaches, the British, Canadian and French troops fought house to house in towns along the coast. Most of the airborne drops behind enemy lines were way off target and paratroopers were scattered across a large area. Yet, the Allies gained a foothold, confused and disrupted the enemy, and soon were able to move inland for the drive to defeat Germany.There is nothing about the plot to give away – the story is well known. But the production of this movie– about such a major event in world history, begs a close look for its achievement.The film is based on a book by Irish-American author Cornelius Ryan, who also wrote the screenplay. Ryan had been a war correspondent who was driven to write a book about the world-changing event. After a 1949 visit to Normandy, he began his research and interviewed more than 1,000 D-Day veterans. He finished his novel in 1959, and 'The Longest Day: 6 June 1944 D-Day' was a huge best-seller.Daryl Zanuck bought the movie rights for 20th Century Fox. More than a dozen of the senior veterans – American, British, French and German, were consultants on the film. More D-Day veterans were military advisers. The result was a movie that closely followed the real event. The film won two Oscars and had three more nominations for its technical excellence. It had a huge cast that included more than two dozen notable actors of the day – all who gave top performances.'The Longest Day' had a $10 million budget – the record for black and white films until 'Schindler's List' 30 years later. The film was one of the first to record characters of different nations in their own languages. English subtitles appear in the German and French scenes. The movie was filmed at locations in France, including parachute scenes in Ste. Marie-Eglise. The beach landing scenes were shot on the Ile de Re in the Bay of Biscay off the coast of La Rochelle, France.As with any war film, all of the aircraft and ships couldn't be the originals, or even of the same time period. But Zanuck found Messerschmitts and Spitfires in the air forces of Spain and Belgium, and he rented them for the beach strafing scenes. Only military purists will note the different equipment elsewhere that's not accurate.The scenes of the invasion fleet were filmed in June 1961 during maneuvers of the U.S. Sixth fleet. It was then stationed in the Mediterranean. The film crews shot around the fleet's aircraft carrier because there were no carriers in the Normandy invasion. But 22 ships of the Sixth Fleet were photographed for the movie.The movie opened in France on Sept. 25, in America on Oct. 4, and in Great Britain on Oct. 23. When it came out, I was serving in the 1/504 airborne of the 1st Brigade, 8th Infantry Division at Mainz, Germany. The 2/505 airborne was part of our brigade. I met some of its troopers who had been in the jump scenes for the movie. Ste. Marie-Eglise, France, has an Airborne Museum dedicated to the American paratroopers who helped liberate Normandy. The movie shows a company of the 505 that was slaughtered by the Germans when it was dropped right on the town.Quite a bit is made about John Wayne's age in playing the part of Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, and I agree. By way of comparison to airborne commanders, the ages of most senior military officers are 15 to 20 years older. Those in this film – Allied and German, were mostly in their 50s. And, the actors who played them were very close in age. But, both actors who played the American paratroop leaders were way over age – and looked it. Wayne was 54 when he played his role – twice the actual age of Vandervoort who was 27 at the time. And Robert Ryan, at 52, was 15 years older than the real Brig Gen. James Gavin who was 37 at the time. This is a point worth noting.In the 1945 movie, 'Objective Burma,' Errol Flynn's character tells an older reporter that the paratroopers, including their officers, have to be young men to stand up to the rigors of airborne missions. 'Do you know how old the colonel is in there? Thirty-four. You know how old our commanding general is? Thirty-seven.' I appreciate and enjoy John Wayne and Robert Ryan as actors, but this is one time when the roles they played would better have been cast with someone else. Charlton Heston was supposed to have wanted the role that Wayne got. At age 39, he would have been good for either role. But, Paul Newman at 37 would have been just right as Gen. Gavin, and Steve McQueen at 32 would have been ideal as Vandervoort.",10,3,5,28 May 2016
Major League," A funny, but brash, adult baseball comedy
","This is one of the funniest, but vulgar, adult sports films ever made. And, it's strictly adult, so parents will want to be wary and read the parents guide. But for many adults it's very funny throughout. From several of the reviews I've read, I'm surprised that none of them recognized this as a clever satire as well. It spoofs – mostly in a friendly but brash way – many aspects of professional baseball, from greedy management (not most, thank goodness) to prima donna players. It really has fun with baseball signals, and even the fans. 'Major League' is a funny sports movie, but I can't agree with some who think it ranks among the best of the baseball films. To be in that category, it would have to be watchable by a larger, diverse audience. When it comes to the game, I think the more serious films tell a better story about America's favorite pastime. One of the best is 'Pride of the Yankees,' the 1942 biopic with Gary Cooper playing Lou Gehrig. Another is the story of Monty Stratton in the 1949 movie, 'The Stratton Story,' that stars James Stewart. Dan Dailey stars as Dizzy Dean in the 1952 biopic, 'The Pride of St. Louis.' A recent move, '42' in 2013 tells the story of Jackie Robinson, another great ball player and the first black player to break the color barrier in professional baseball. Other top baseball films include, 'The Winning Team' of 1952, 'Fear Strikes Out' of 1957, 'Bang the Drum Slowly' of 1973, 'The Natural' of 1984, 'Eight Men Out' of 1988, and 'A League of Their Own' of 1992.These and many other films give a good picture of baseball and what it has meant to Americans since the late 1800s. 'Major League,' on the other hand, is a spoof of baseball that's meant to entertain with brash comedy. Unfortunately, its appeal mainly is to men who enjoy vulgar humor. Had they toned that down a couple notches, this film could have been a real keeper and enjoyed by many more people. Yes, there is humor without vulgarity, and much more of it.",7,0,2,16 October 2015
The Dark Knight," Too many fans seem to be blown away
","Many commenters said they were 'blown away,' so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.Maybe I'm beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? I'm not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasn't (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in 'unexpecteds' is trying to outdo the action mayhem.When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. I'm not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but can't agree with so many who rate this film at the top.It's good and entertaining -- but too long. It's not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I don't mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom don't have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you won't be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment.",6,435,1034,31 July 2008
Annie Hall," Hard to laugh at such neurosis and unhappy living
","Woody Allen is a good comedian and an excellent comedy writer. As an actor, he's just so-so. He's a newer type of character actor. The whimpering, complaining, afraid, neurotic egocentric funny guy that most of us wouldn't mind having for a friend, but we couldn't stand his hanging around very long. That's how Allen and his movie, 'Annie Hall,' struck me. It has some very funny lines. But that's about all in its favor. What there is of a plot isn't much. There's no great drama, there are no surprises, twists or turns. No great moments. But there is a tremendous amount of the whimpering, complaining, poor-me, down-and-out, hapless, misunderstood, unloved and obviously unfulfilled and unhappy Alvy Singer.Watching this movie again recently, it struck me that Hollywood must be in the business of countering the mood of the culture at any given time. We know of the great comedies, romance and other entertaining films during the Great Depression. So, then, in the 1970s when life seemed mostly on the up, Hollywood came up with lots of downer stuff. Yes, it's comedy, but how long can people see and feel the funny with so much misery? The downer starts to wear on one. And, judging from the number of people who have rated this movie by 2015, and its high rating, maybe the downer syndrome is still with us. If that's what the public wants, that what the public gets – and we in Hollywood will help them decide what they want. There was a time when some in the movie industry considered what was good and needed for the ethos of society. As I recall, the 1970s and 1980s were the psycho-pop decades. Anybody who had money – especially in the cities, had a psychiatrist. We were doing so well that Americans and our society couldn't handle well the prosperity and good times that had blossomed. So, now we had workaholics, broken relationships and marriages, multiple divorces, broken families, and kids out of control because their parents were strangers to them. Counselors were coming out of the woodwork to help the suffering successes of society. No one understood them. They had dysfunctional childhoods and subsequent disorderly lifestyles. So, there were these comedies that milked that for a time. And, there also were a whole bunch of fluffy, feel-good movies to help reassure folks and lift spirits. What distinguished these from the thread of such films that have always been around is that this large group for the most part lacked any great drama and acting. Perhaps it was because there were so many, and so few of substance.'Annie Hall' earned four Oscars in the 1977 Academy Awards – two for Woody Allen for directing and screenplay writing; and Diane Keaton as best actress. I don't want to demean these or the other stars and movie makers for their achievements. But this film also won best picture for the year. There was so little competition. There were no great films in 1977. One came close – 'The Turning Point,' which received 11 nominations but no awards. The two big pictures that year were sci-fi films that will be long remembered before any other films of that year. 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' already have proved their staying power decades down the road.That so many other people could sit through and enjoy this movie so much might say something about our times and the quality of the entertainment we have now. I enjoyed several of Woody Allen's films much more than 'Annie Hall.' I can't seem to laugh after a while at such neurosis and miserable living.",5,0,4,31 May 2015
Pride & Prejudice," Very good film version of Austen novel
","This modern version of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' is very good. It's sure to entertain all but the most ardent Jane Austen fans. And, but for the remarkable 1995 BBC mini-series, this movie might even win the hearts of most die-hard Austen fans. The movie has several small weaknesses, but some strengths that mostly make up for those. Among its strong points are the roles of several of the actors. Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike are excellent as the oldest Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Brenda Blethyn is very good as Mrs. Bennet, and Claudie Blakely does very well as Charlotte Lucas. Matthew Macfadyen is very good as Mr. Darcy, and Judi Dench plays Lady de Bourg very well. The roles of other major players are so-so, and most of the lesser players are not developed enough. The other strong points of this film are its cinematography, makeup and sets. All are excellent. This movie is considered a modern adaptation of Austen's novel in the language, manners and personal behavior of the characters. Films made about stories that take place in the past – however along ago, should reflect those times and their culture and customs as closely as possible. When they do so, they serve a great value. As such, they are windows into the history and culture of those past times. They educate movie goers about the times, their customs and events. But, if they are not accurate, they give false impressions about the past. The modern tinges to the script and roles in this film are not such that they would significantly mislead viewers about Austen's late 18th century England. But, the script and direction overall have some pluses and minuses. The general strengths are in the liveliness of character roles. The weaknesses are mostly in the portrayal of the Bennet family, its home, and the community. In this regard, the costumes and settings also are questionable. The character of Elizabeth is a little too silly early on – she is more closely akin to the younger girls than to Jane. But the younger girls – Lydia and Kitty are just shown in their girlish behavior briefly. And, between Elizabeth and Darcy, we see almost instant attraction for the first meeting. This comes on far too strong and too early in the film. This movie is 11 minutes longer than the 1940 film, and is able to get more of the story on film. Still, several of the incidents are crowded to the point of possibly confusing viewers. Events are rushed in places, and anyone not familiar with the story may get lost or not know what is going on in those instances. This is especially true toward the end of the film. The film fails to develop some of the characters enough, so the viewer's interest is barely aroused in Mr. Wickham, Georgiana Darcy, the Gardiners and some others. One thing that struck me as very wrong had to do with the early scenes at the community dance and the first ball. The setting, costumes and music made me think that I was watching a barn dance in the American colonies. The later ball scenes were more refined, and more likely attuned to the landed gentry. Along these same lines, as noted by some other reviewers, are the barnyard atmosphere around the house with chickens and hogs moving freely around and even inside the house. The Bennets had a cook and other servants. So would family members have been doing the laundry and other chores as implied in the film? With all the mud around the house, we saw people coming and going all the time, but no mud tracked on the floors, and no sign of people taking off their shoes. A small estate like that of the Bennet's may surely have had barns, corals, and servant's lodgings and outbuildings. But those would have been removed a short distance from the house. And the family members of the estate wouldn't have been trudging through the mud and farmyard. One interesting scene stands out all alone in this regard. Elizabeth is sitting on a swing that is suspended from rafters in a drive-through farm building. The ground all around her clearly is a mess of mud. So, she should have had very muddy boots, shoes or feet. Yet we see her twisting in the swing with her bare feet sticking straight out. They look quite clean. This is an entertaining version of Jane Austen's great novel by the same name. If you enjoy this film, you will be enthralled by the 1995 TV mini-series starring Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth and a host of other marvelous actors. It runs 5.5 hours and gives full treatment to most of the characters and situations of the novel.",8,0,1,7 April 2014
Avatar," A spectacular show of 'cinematic fireworks'
","'Avatar' is billed as an action, adventure and fantasy film. While it is all of these, it's basic plot and makeup is all science fiction. There's no doubt about the fantastic technical and production qualities of this film. It's a joy just to watch the colorful scenes, sets and creatures of Pandora. CGI clearly has gone to the next level in creating backdrops, sets and scenes for use with live action filming. This is very good fantasy stuff. With so many reviews already, I won't rehash what others have said. But, I didn't see reference in the comments I scanned to a couple of things worth noting. So, this is to add them to the discussion of this film. A number of others are critical of the film for its lack of originality. It's true that the same themes of the genre of sci-fi and space exploration have been used a great deal before. The earth has depleted its resources and must find new ones somewhere else. The indigenous creatures of Pandora have their own deity. So, this film has considerable mythology. The new type of bionic man comes into this one with a scientific melding of human and something else. The humans are aliens to this planet or moon, and there is the usual division of some who care about the natives and others who couldn't care less about them. Much less often, fantasy and sci-fi films will use a writing trait found in classical literature. That is symbolic names and other words. Two leap out in this film. The first is the moon's name, Pandora. From Greek mythology, Pandora's box (or jar) today refers to a plethora of things that can cause havoc or problems. That fits this movie all too well. The second obvious symbolic word is the name for the rare mineral that earth needs, 'unobtanium.' So, it can't be obtained on earth or elsewhere.What is a somewhat unique about 'Avatar' is that it combines all of the above aspects of sci-fi and more. But with so much action and all of the visual spectacles, it makes a plot that is very difficult to follow. When I came out of the theater after seeing this film the first time, I thought about the splendid visual show it was, but also wondered if there was any real point in the plot. It seemed to be just a complex story made to pull together many scenes of action, visual treats, and wild fantasy and sci-fi things. Watching it again, the visual spectacle is still there, and the plot fades. So, this isn't a film that would be recognized for the original and main crafts of theater - acting and directing. A good analogy might be with what Americans enjoy every year in celebrating the Fourth of July. Whoever tires of watching spectacular fireworks displays? We don't think about the theme, or the reason or the history at that moment. And, year after year we turn out to watch the fireworks again. 'Avatar' isn't so much a movie or film with a great story and actors performing in it. It's just a spectacular fireworks display on the silver screen.",7,1,1,17 June 2018
Victory," POWs have a ball in this WW II escape film
","Many movies made about World War II are complete fiction. The stories are totally fabricated but set within the context of the war. Most, but not all, are based on novels. Some of the better action and intriguing war films fit in this category. And, some books and movies are based on certain theaters and aspects of the war. These include battles and campaigns, the underground and resistance, POW camps and escape stories. 'Victory' is one such movie. It was based on a 1962 Hungarian film that itself was inspired by a mythical football (soccer) match between a Kiev team and the German occupation forces in the Ukraine during WW II. While there wasn't such a match, three matches did take place between a Kiev soccer club and a team of the occupying Germans. The Ukrainians won all three, and after the last match, the Kiev players were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Many other matches apparently were held between Ukrainian clubs and German Army teams – about 150 total, with the Ukrainians winning a ratio of 6-3.5-1.5. See 'The Death March' under Wikipedia for a detailed account and more background.This film is set in Germany and France, and involves British and American POWs, as well as a collection of Allied prisoners from other countries. So, 'Victory,' aka, 'Escape to Victory' outside America, is a combination POW, soccer competition, underground resistance, and escape film. It also fits in the category of very late films made about WW II. All the players are good. But, Sylvester Stalone, as U.S. Army Capt. Robert Hatch, has some hammy lines when he is with the French girl, Renee (played by Carole Laure) in the Paris underground. Producer Freddie Fields assembled an impressive cast beyond Stalone. Michael Caine shares the lead with Stalone, as British Capt. John Colby. And, Max von Sydow plays German Major Karl Von Steiner. A coup for the film is Pele, the famous Brazilian soccer player, and several other professional soccer players for both the POW and German teams. The Allied assortment is explained by POWs who played soccer being transferred in from other prisons. The film makes a clear statement about the German treatment of East Europeans, compared to prisoners from other countries. Caine's Colby insists that the soccer prisoners from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other Eastern countries be included. When five of them show up, they appear to be undernourished shells of former athletes. None would be able to recuperate for a long time, but Colby keeps them for the team rather than send them back. The pro soccer players in the film were from teams that had won national and/or world championships. They came from Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, England, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Norway, Poland and Scotland. The movie was filmed in Hungary and France. Because Paris had changed so much, with modern buildings in the 35 years since the end of WW II, they couldn't shoot the soccer match there. Instead, Fields found a stadium in Budapest, the 'Paris of the East.'This movie is a lighter account of Allied POWs during WW II. It has none of the drama or trauma of other films about the reality of wartime POW camps. But, it is entertaining and a fun film with some good scenes of soccer play. The French underground escape by the Allied team doesn't come off as planned. The team couldn't leave at half-time with the Jerry's in the lead. To the delight of the fans – mostly thousands of French civilians hustled into the stadium to make a crowd (Hungarian extras in Budapest), the Allies rally and the game ends a tie (a legitimate Allied goal having been denied earlier). And, the excitement of the crowd turns into a spontaneous mass movement onto the field and dispersion of the Allied soccer players among the fans as they leave the stadium. The ending is priceless and caps an entertaining fictional film that most members of the family should enjoy.",7,2,2,10 April 2017
There's Something About Mary," Scraping the barrel to find funny
","Many years ago, I read a comment by a past great comic (I can't remember who it was) who said that modern examples of toilet humor just meant that the writers couldn't come up with real comedy. That might apply as well to writers of raunchy, distasteful and demeaning material. One hesitates to call it humor or comedy. I am aware, though, that there is a market for such material, so there are those writers (and producers, actors and others) who would want to cash in on it.Thus we have this 1998 film, 'There's Something About Mary.' The cast leads in this film all have shaky records of success with comedies. That goes for Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller, especially. Matt Dillon's career is most promising with drama. Most of these comedies have not been box office hits. And for most such films, the efforts for comedy are primarily situational, along with the crude and crass dialog. There is minimal clever or witty dialog. It does seem that the writers for this film checked their minds at the theater doors.Other reviewers noted the newness of the comedy approach in this 1998 film. And, while it was a big box office hit (probably because of the interest in the new comedy method), the brand didn't stick as a huge success. For that, there have been more failures (losses) than successes (profits). Most movie fans, it seems, still prefer intelligent, genuine comedy and clever scripts over the obscene and crude. The two stars are for a couple of funny instances in this otherwise dreary attempt at humor.",2,1,3,11 October 2019
Where Eagles Dare," Eagles Dare has everything -- the very best of entertainment
","Plot, acting, action, mystery and suspense, espionage, war — Where Eagles Dare has these and more. And, its many elements are blended well into a film that provides great entertainment. This first-rate film is based on a fiction novel of World War II by British author Alistair MacLean. The top-notch cast delivers very good performances (watch some of the facial expressions of Clint Eastwood, some of the German officers and the men in the mission group; hear the heavy breathing by Richard Burton from his trudging up and down in the snow and frequent climbing, and then his comment at one point on exhaustion). The main setting is a castle somewhere in or near the Bavarian Alps that provides outstanding scenery. The female roles reflect the importance of the women within the plot without a gratuitous sex scene or aspect so common today. Indeed, that would have reduced the value and characters of the women in the story. There may indeed have been a relationship between two of the main characters, but the movie didn't exploit that with a scene of intimacy that would distract us from the plot. So, in the absence of 'sexploitation,' we are left wondering  and maybe even imagining a little bit — great aspects of films in the past. But just a little bit, because the plot and action pick right up and carry us on.The film moves very nicely — with a great mix of action, plot twists and turns, and suspense. In an on-camera interview late in his life, Gregory Peck (1916–2003) said that the quality and value of movies in his day was determined by good stories that have good acting and that entertain the audience. Of course, there are other values and qualities of films as well — to inspire, to inform and educate, to embolden and excite, to confirm or influence, to cause us to pause and reflect with gratitude. These can fall within the many types of film, from action adventures to wars and westerns. But in the analysis offered by the late Oscar-winning actor Peck, Where Eagles Dare fits solidly in the mainstream of great movies that entertain. I don't watch commercial TV, and hadn't seen this movie but once after its first release — and that last time many years ago. So, it was a treat to watch it again and to add it now to my collection of outstanding films for my family's posterity.",10,3,5,20 August 2008
Invincible," Very good sports drama set on the Philadelphia gridiron
","Based on a true story, 'Invincible' is a first-rate sports drama. Touted as the story of a 30-year-old bartender who becomes a pro football players for the Philadelphia Eagles, the film actually is two stories in one. The major story is that of Vince Papale, a pro-football 'walk-on' for the 1976 Philadelphia Eagles. Initially shunned by his 'pro' teammates, Papale was welcomed after a spectacular special teams play. In the regular season home opener against the New York Giants, he tackled a punt receiver, causing a fumble, and then picked up the fumble and ran it 30 plus yards for a touchdown. The overlapping story is that of the hiring of Dick Vermeil as head coach of the Eagles. Both stories take place mostly over a single year – 1976. This is a Disney film, and as with any Hollywood production, some of the details are fictitious. In a nutshell, Papale played three seasons for the Eagles and retired after the 1978 season due to a shoulder injury. He played wide receiver and on specialty teams. It took Vermeil a couple of seasons to turn the Eagles around from a losing team, but in the third year they made the NFL playoffs. That also was Papale's last year playing ball. Two seasons later, Vermeil's Eagles made it to the Super Bowl, losing to Oakland, 10-27, on Jan. 5, 1981. After retiring a couple of times from coaching, Vermeil took over a losing program at St. Louis and took the Rams to Super Bowl XXXIV, and a win on Jan. 30, 2000. Here are some interesting facts and true details about how Papale and Vermeil got connected. Papale attended St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. The school didn't have a football team, but he excelled in track and field. He won or placed in several events during track meets. His highest clearance as a pole-vaulter was 15 feet, 1 ¾ inches. In his senior year, he won events in the long jump and triple jump. Papale never played college football, but he played both years that the World Football League existed. He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Bells in 1974 and 1975. Dick Vermeil saw video of Papale's play for the Bells and invited him to try out for the Eagles. Of course, he had to prove himself and earn the spot on the team. And, that's what is most prominent and accurate about the movie. Here are a couple of interesting tidbits about Papale. He was nicknamed 'Rocky' by his friends – a reference to the fictional boxer in the Sylvester Stalone movie who rose from the rough side of Philadelphia to become world heavyweight boxing champion. Papale is six feet, two inches, and Mark Wahlberg is only five feet, eight inches. But, Wahlberg, himself a tough guy with a tough upbringing and past, gives the part the guts and fire that Coach Vermeil says he was looking for and saw in Papale. When Papale made the Eagles roster in 1976, he was 30 years old. Outside of kickers, he was the oldest rookie NFL player in history to not have played college football. He played in 41 of the 44 regular season games of the Eagles in 1976-78. He had two fumble recoveries and one interception for 15 yards. His teammates elected him special teams captain. In 1978, the Eagles named him the team's 'Man of the Year' for his support of many charities. Dick Vermeil was named 'Coach of the Year' for his coaching at four levels – high school, junior college, college and pro ball. He took over three losing professional teams and turned them around. Beside the Eagles and St. Louis Rams, he revived the Kansas City Chiefs, building that team into a contender from 2001 to 2005. This is a very good inspiring and entertaining sports drama.",8,1,1,9 November 2017
Groundhog Day," One of the funniest and original 'philosophical' comedies
","This is one of the first movies I bought on DVD after the technology came out in 1997 in the U.S. It is an ideal movie to watch when one feels blue or down in the dumps. Its humorous script and scenes always give me many laughs. Besides the humorous situations Bill Murray's Phil gets into, this film has a distinct message. It is a morality play without being preachy. It lets us see the consequences of living a selfish hedonistic life versus a decent unselfish life. And, it's all done with great humor.The genius of Harold Ramis as a comedy writer is apparent in this film. Ramis wrote some of the funniest scripts of the last half of the 20th century (besides 'Groundhog Day' – 'Caddyshack' in 1980, 'Stripes' in 1981, 'Ghostbusters' in 1984 and others). The trivia section has an interesting item under the IMDb biography of Ramis. He and Bill Murray had a falling out over 'Groundhog Day' that ended their collaboration on films. The item refers to an interview Ramis gave. He said the falling out was 'due to differing views on what the film should be about (Murray wanted it to be more philosophical, Ramis wanted it to be a comedy).' That seems sad and ironic because this film turned out to be such a great philosophical comedy. I don't know if anyone else has tried to count the number of times that Phil wakes up to the same day, Feb. 2 in this film. The advantage of a DVD makes it a little easier to do that; but still, some of the repetitious scenes flash so quickly that it takes some effort, and sitting through the film a few times to try to nail down the number. My count is 39 times, with the 40th occurrence being Feb. 3. If we were to figure how much time it would take Phil to learn the things he does – French poetry, playing the piano, ice sculptor, and to do all the good deeds he does, who knows how many days that would take in reality. A big majority of the scenes are his failures that also provide much of the humor. But, toward the end of those, the sense of futility that we viewers begin to feel starts to wear on the humor. So, the filmmakers timed it perfectly and at that point Phil is inspired to turn around – by something that Rita says. Andie MacDowell plays Phil's TV producer, Rita, very well; and Chris Elliott is very good as Larry, the cameraman.Phil's repeated days probably would have totaled a year or more. The only incongruity in the logic of the plot is at the end. But, without it, the film ending wouldn't make sense. The one characteristic throughout the film up to that point is that only Phil has his days repeated. To everyone else, it's Feb. 2 for the first and only time. And, every day Phil begins with the knowledge (lessons) of the previous repeated days. The accumulation of the days and their experiences explains how Phil can progress from one day to the next when he begins to read, study, play the piano, etc. Of course, some scenes would be a little different over time – i.e., Phil being able to play the piano a little better on succeeding days with his piano teacher, played by Peggy Roeder.So, for the final February 2, all the people whom Phil has encountered on his many repeated days of Feb. 2 now know him fairly well. It's not likely that he would have been able to do all of what he did in one day, so now all the other characters also have a cumulative memory of days knowing Phil in the past. As I said, it's the only way it makes sense. I wouldn't normally dissect a film this much, but 'Groundhog Day' is such a unique concept for a movie that it invites this sort of circumspection and analysis.Here are a few choice lines that alone give a laugh each time. Phil, 'Out in California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow gang wars and some very overpriced real estate. Up in the Pacific Northwest, as you can see, they're going to have some very tall trees.'Phil, 'Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster.' Mrs. Lancaster, 'I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen.'On the phone in his room, Phil: 'Yeah, sport. I know there's a blizzard. When are the long distance lines gonna be repaired? Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today . Hello?  Hello?'Phil, 'What would you do if you were stuck in one place  and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did mattered?' Ralph, 'That about sums it up for me.'Gus, 'Hey, Phil. If we wanted to hit mailboxes, we could let Ralph drive.'The dinner scene with Rita is a riot when Phil asks her what she is looking for in a man. She describes admirable traits, and Phil says, 'Me  me  me.' She describes some more, and Phil answers, 'Me  me . Me.' Rita, 'He's not afraid to cry in front of me.' Phil, 'This is a man we're talking about, right?' Rita, 'He likes animals, children, and he'll change poopy diapers.' Phil, 'Does he have to use the word, 'poopy?'' Rita, 'Oh, and he plays an instrument, and he loves his mother.' Phil, 'I am really close on this one. Really, really close.''Groundhog Day' is one of the best comedies of all time. It's sure to tickle a funny bone. It is sophisticated comedy that older kids and adults should enjoy immensely.",10,2,3,21 March 2015
Pulp Fiction," Blood, guts and garbage talk doesn't entertain this movie buff
","The modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of Quentin Tarantino. The writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. But films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. The plot of 'Pulp Fiction' is very weak - almost pointless. And when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, I don't find much of anything entertaining.I enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. But for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. 'Reservoir Dogs' was such a Tarantino movie. But this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. While there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. So, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters.An example of this is when Christopher Walken's Captain Koons tells a tall story to a young boy named Butch Coolidge. Two scenarios or so later, Butch is a full-grown boxer played by Bruce Willis. Other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. This seems to be a style with Tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. I think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically.This sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. And, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. We don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. But wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. So, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. And, some of these films really don't have endings.This film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. Tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. It ruins what might be a good story for me. As for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? Seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.'Pulp Fiction' isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. It is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. The only thing I can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. But I'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting.",2,1,4,14 September 2019
"McFarland, USA"," Uplifting high school sports film
","Hollywood has been good in one area a couple decades into the 21st century. It has turned out some very good sports films based on true stories. 'McFarland, USA' is one. The movie was made by Disney in 2015, from a screenplay that was being developed since 2004. It's based on a true story of a high school teacher, Jim White, who made championship cross-country teams in the mid-1980s at a small California high school. The town of McFarland is in the farm area of central California, north of Bakersfield. The high school is largely Hispanic.Kevin Costner heads the cast as White, and all turn in fine performances. This is a very good drama, historical and biographical film. It is peppered with small doses of humor. The production qualities are superb. As with most such films, this one has been changed from fact to fiction in places. But, it tells a good story about a coach, a town and a high school team. Some of the fictional changes including White having been fired from different teaching jobs before going to McFarland. In reality, he began there in 1964 after he graduated from Pepperdine University. White taught different classes and grades until 1980 when he began coaching. When he noticed the speed of some of the kids, he decided to start cross-country running which the school had dropped the previous year. The film is just about the boys' team, but he started both boys and girls teams, and took both of them to the Cayucos beach during the 1985 season. White had three daughters, not two as in the movie. And they were older in real life. At the time of the cross-country championships, the girls were in college. The move was a hit and apparently led to increased interest in cross- country running in schools around the country. This is a good film that should be of special interest to young teens. Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Cheryl White, 'Fourth place? That's not too shabby. Jim, 'Four out of four – also known as last.'Jim White, 'Tell your father I said it was an honor to be invited into his home.' David Diaz, 'Dad, he said it was an honor to be invited into your home.' Senor Diaz, 'Tell him I said 'Thanks!''",8,1,1,14 April 2017
Mystic River," A raw film about crime from the street neighborhoods of Boston
","'Mystic River' is a raw crime film about growing up and living in the street neighborhoods of Boston. It's based on a 2001 novel of the same title by Dennis Lehane. The story gets its name from the Mystic River that runs through the Northwest of the city and empties into Boston Harbor.From an opening short scene of boyhood, the movie quickly jumps 25 years. Three boyhood friends have drifted apart, with far different lives. One is an ex-con who's become a king of the old neighborhood in which he owns a mom and pop grocery store. Another is a homicide detective. And the third is a blue-collar worker who still suffers quietly from sexual abuse as a boy at the hands of two men. One wore the Roman collar of a priest, the other was a plain-clothes policeman. The boy was abducted for four days. This incident isn't discussed any more in the film, but it comes back in a big way in the events that follow these many years later.Clint Eastwood co-produced, directed and wrote the score for this film. It has his mark of a dark side of life. It's a story about dysfunctional families, child abuse, crime, hatred, homosexuality, murder, revenge, teen prostitution, vengeance and secrets. The film is a furtive look at vigilante justice, blind revenge, distrust of innocence, criminal denial of guilt and injustice.It's a powerful, sad film that ends without resolution. This has become a trademark of Eastwood films. He brings a story to an end, but the characters will go on living without a satisfactory conclusion to the story. This is a hard movie to sit through for its violence, meanness, and frequent obscenities and vulgar language. The R rating fits, except that it might have another label - for mature adults. This is the type of film that can badly influence immature adults as well as young people.The acting is superb throughout the film. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins received double awards - Oscars and Golden Globes, for their roles. Penn won the best actor awards and Robbins won the best supporting actor awards.Although it received critical praise, 'Mystic River' isn't a film for every adult.",7,0,0,5 January 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," Much more than a sentimental film
","Maybe it has something to do with waiting a few years between viewings of the same film. Maybe it has to do with maturing or that mysterious acquisition of wisdom that comes with years. Maybe it has to do with slowing down in retirement, paying more attention to details and people and surroundings. Maybe it's a combination of these and other things. But after going many years without seeing 'It's a Wonderful Life,' I played the DVD at home just before Christmas this year and saw much more than I had remembered of the film in the past. To be sure, there is nothing wrong with the warm sentimentalism I had associated with the movie over the years. But this time I saw and heard and became immersed in a film steeped in values and development far beyond plain entertainment or of a happy story with a happy ending. Good movies of various genres must be entertaining to be enjoyable. Comedies, romances, musicals, and others may provide good talented performances, humor, action, excitement or mystery. And some may have one or two social values or morals interwoven in their plots. But good drama demands exposition and exploration of more values and a wider range of emotions and mores. That is what we see and hear and become part of in 'It's a Wonderful Life.'This film has the standard good guys versus bad guys, and the good-over- evil happy ending. But it probes and reaches much deeper into life in its many characters. It contrasts greed with unselfishness, ambition and dreams with sacrifice and kindness, disrespect with trust, arrogance with humility, lies with truth, power and loneliness with compassion and friendship, exploitation with integrity. It's about taking and giving, honesty and dishonesty, hating and loving, family and friends. And as these themes weave throughout the texture of the story, we see the emotions of love, anger, happiness, shame, fear, hurt and joy play out. In his state of despair, George Bailey gets a chance to see his world without his having been born. We viewers share in seeing the sharp contrasts in the people, places and events that we had seen in George's life up to that time. The enduring message is the huge importance of a single life in the lives of all others. And how one person – each one of us – is so important in shaping the lives of others and the events of life far beyond our own small worlds. We have much to celebrate when we realize how wonderful life really is.A 1991 documentary special has interview snippets with Frank Capra in which he reflects on this film. 'Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life': Personal Remembrance' was hosted by Frank Capra Jr. He says of his father, 'the theme that everyone's life touches so many other lives was one that moved my dad more deeply than any other idea.' Of all his many hits and achievements, Capra most cherished this film. In that documentary – 45 years after the film, Capra himself talks about finding more and more in the film over time. 'There's more to the picture than I put in it,' Capra says. 'There's more to the picture than was written in it. There's more value in the picture than we knew we were playing with  and that we didn't expect. There's more to it than we thought we had.'This addendum is added to these comments in December 2016. One of my latest realizations in watching 'It's a Wonderful Life' again this Christmas season, has to do with the crisis that led to George's self- destructive and desperate behavior. Uncle Billy is in the bank to make a deposit of $8,000 for the savings and loan. He has his wits and sense about him. But, when Mr. Potter enters the bank in his wheelchair, Billy goes berserk. He grabs Potter's newspaper and boasts about the Bailey brothers and the latest hero, Harry, who will be getting the Congressional Medal of Honor. He insults Potter. 'After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home. Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.'Potter himself doesn't care that no one likes him, as he says he doesn't care for them. But, Billy is acting out his dislike, anger, even hatred that he and others have toward Potter – maybe even George. And, this dislike or hatred is so strong that it distracts him from the responsible task he had. The fact that Billy then couldn't recall how he might have lost the money shows how deeply cutting one's anger and hatred can be, and the harm it can do to oneself. A second new insight came to me watching the film again these years later. A bank examiner is in the building and loan to check the books just before Christmas. George shows him the newspaper and says, 'Mr. Carter, we're all excited around here. My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.' And Carter replies, 'Well, I guess they do those things.' Was that a cinematic dig at commercialism, or seeming cold-heartedness of people in the business world? Anything to do with a Medal of Honor would normally evoke praise, or congratulations or some positive response. World War II had just ended. And, here was this stodgy old bank examiner indifferent toward the highest military honor of America going to a local hero. Was this to show that there was a lack of patriotism among some? Or, perhaps not everyone was elated over the end of the war? I don't know the answer, but as director Frank Capra said, we will continue to discover more and more in this great film as time goes on.",10,2,5,25 December 2009
Crazy Heart," A life on the road circuit of the lone musician
","Those who feverishly follow live music performances may relate more closely to this film than most. But I doubt that even country music fans would get much out of if by way of musical enjoyment. Jeff Bridges does play and sing, as do Colin Farrell and some others, but most of the music is in short segments. And those, often with interruptions or breaks of some sort. Mostly this is a movie about a musician years past his prime, who makes his living playing to the middle-aged folks who liked his music in the past. He does this in restaurants, bowling alleys, and bars. Part of his being beyond his prime is his lifestyle. Bridges plays Bad Blake, an alcoholic who writes and sings 'authentic' country western tunes. But, he hasn't done anything new in years. Now he goes from town to town across the Western U.S., playing for a living. He stays in sleazy or rundown motels. The rest of his lifestyle includes bedding down whatever camp follower presents herself for the night. A romance enters his life in a much younger woman who has a four-year-old son. It's as though this one particular acquaintance on the road clicks where none before have. That's a little hard to believe. But the dysfunction of Blake's person and lifestyle finally wake up Jean (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal), who calls it quits. This apparently has been different enough from Blake's usual encounters that it leads him to despair and he finally asks for help to battle his alcoholism. While not the way Blake wants it, the film has a sort of hopeful and appropriate ending. The film is based on a 1987 novel of the same title, by Thomas Cobb. That story was inspired by honky-tonk country-Western musician Hank Thompson (1925-2007). Bridges won the Academy Award for best actor for his role. This isn't the type of film that offers musical entertainment, as do most musicals. It's not fun picture to watch, but some viewers may appreciate it for the drama and Blake's rehab.",6,0,1,2 May 2018
War of the Worlds," Much mayhem and running can't match the first film
","This rendition of 'War of the Worlds' comes more than 50 years after the classic 1953 movie. As with so many other Hollywood remakes, this film isn't nearly as good as the first one. That's mostly because of the plot, as well as adaptations to the story. This adaptation in some ways is closer to the H.G. Wells 1898 novel of the same title, and in other ways not so. Both the original film and this one change the locale from England to the United States. The tripod machines in this film very closely resemble those of Wells' book. Likewise, the tentacles that protrude from them. The original film adaptation didn't have tripods, but used hovering spacecraft with appendages and extensions that do the work of the tentacles in the novel and this film. The 1953 film had the invasion coming from Mars, and this one has it coming from another galaxy. Within a few years of the 1953 film, scientists had concluded that life could not exist on Mars. But even with science fiction, when things don't have to make sense due to man's limited knowledge at a particular time, a movie should be wary of things that defy common sense. And that's where the adaptations in this 2005 film go awry. We learn that the tripod machines were buried deep within the earth millions of years earlier. Then we see that the pilots of the tripods are transferred to them through the lightning strikes from hovering spacecraft that we can't see because they are enveloped in some sort of cloud or smoke cover. So, the pilots from this super highly advanced civilization millions of years ago, must have returned to whatever ship brought them to the earth, and gone back in it to their home planet. We have no idea why it would be millions of years later that they would invade the earth to annihilate it. And, if they were so advanced, one would think their science would have known something about microbiology, which they surely had on their planet. So, why wouldn't they have taken precautions? And, would their earlier pilots not have had exposure to the microbes on earth then, that they could have studied. In making this alien race so much more advanced than man (and so much more so than in the novel), this film stretches the sci-fi to the realm of absurd, rather than that of 'what if.' Why would the aliens destroy so many humans when the human blood seems to be their food? Especially, since the humans could do them no harm. And, were there similar animals to humans whose blood was their food in their original world? In the book, Wells has some of the tripods being destroyed by the military. But they are too many and too strong to be stopped, and soon overrun the military. Only the microbes cause their demise. The original (1953) movie sticks to Mars as the source of the aliens, so life on their planet would have been similar to that on earth. They would have had microbes and more easily have thought that our biological spheres were similar. While Wells uses tripod machines, the adaptation for the 1953 movie instead had hovering spacecraft. Again, common sense would say that a highly advanced race would have the most sophisticated types of transport and weapons, which would not be cumbersome walking machines. These common sense aspects aside, the current film is one very long chase, with fright and terror. It's one very, very long movie about running, fleeing, interspersed with encounters with the tripods and their mechanical probing eyes. The 1953 film, on the other hand, had a plot with scientists trying to study the aliens, and a larger number of characters in the running and chase aspects. The acting is very good in this film, and the camera work and special effects are tops. But this movie is one long picture of mayhem with giant machines wielding destruction, and very little plot otherwise. It fits that genre of 'Transformers' of 2007 and so many other films of sci-fi mechanical monsters gone mad. It loses the human and real life elements too quickly. There is a 23-foot metal sculpture of a Martian tripod in the home town of H.G. Wells. It's located at Chobham Road (Crown Passage) on Church Street East in Woking, England. That's two blocks east of Jubilee Square and Christchurch.",5,0,1,19 August 2017
Wedding Crashers," Crass and crude with little comedy
","The few instances of actual humor in 'Wedding Crashers' can't raise this film above cheap garbage. Owen Wilson is capable of some very good comedy at times, but is mostly lacking here. I don't care to castigate actors personally. But the belligerent persona of Vince Vaughn's character is a turn off for me. I'm surprised that some actors would be part of something this crass and crude. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour can do very good comedy as well as serious acting. Apparently, most viewers don't see the denigrating attitude this film exudes toward women. The two male leads clearly are misogynists, seeing women just as sex objects.This film is little more than a vulgar view of women. One hopes this type of claptrap isn't a sign of further degeneration of civilization.",2,2,6,5 April 2018
Ice Age," This animal bunch entertains all ages
","This is the first of what was to become a series of animated films with animal characters living in the ice age. Ostensibly for children, it carries a PG rating. It could be because of some of the mild violence that's shown, and some of the scary characters â€“ notably the lions. But more than likely, it's because of the humorous dialog that at times is adult. Indeed, I think 'Ice Age' and it's follow-up films were made more for adults than for kids. It is funny and entertaining, and I think suitable for the whole family. It's one of a small field of films that all ages will sit still for. The little tykes like the fuzzy, cute and bug-eyed animal characters. The young kids and teens will like the action and antics. And adults mostly will enjoy the dialog. This one was a big hit and the sequels continue to draw the crowds. So long as the writers can come up with new ideas for plots, Manny, Sid, Diego and a nameless crazy squirrel could be around a long time. Maybe even to the next ice age.",7,1,1,16 August 2017
Whiplash," Delusional director is the real 'star' of this film
","Writer and director Damien Chazelle says he based 'Whiplash' on his real life experience. He struggled to become a jazz drummer while at Princeton (NJ) High School in the early 2000s. And, he had an intimidating teacher upon whom he based the character of Terence Fletcher in this film.But, his own awareness about his talent was different than that of his lead character in the film. Miles Teller plays Andrew who has a sense of his exceptional natural talent, which Chazelle says he did not have himself. Thus, the writer-director changed his pursuit to filmmaking. This is something to ponder in view of Andrew's outcome in the film, and the suicide of an earlier 'star' student of Fletcher in the movie.Near the film's end, Fletcher says that he pushed those students he thought could be great. So, to him, that justifies his erratic, violent, and abusive behavior. Still, he knows he was fired for his behavior. The film doesn't probe that any further and just leaves it at that.Yet, everything the audience sees and learns about Fletcher says that he is delusional. He's living a lie. The one person whom he claims achieved greatness committed suicide. And, Fletcher lied about that, saying the former student had been killed in a car accident. His treatment wasn't just erratic with those he may have thought were special. He behaved crudely and angrily with everyone - all of the students in his band. The film clearly shows that everyone feared him.So, the conclusion that he was just pushing to bring out the greatness of a master musician doesn't ring true. His latest great talent, Andrew, gave up and quit playing the drums. As the counselor properly advised Andrew and his father, Fletcher was a harmful person who should not be teaching. Indeed, in what public or private school in America would such a bizarre character have been tolerated for so long?One suspects that Chazelle exaggerated the character some - if not a lot. And that's okay for writers and producers who want to have a dramatic effect and make a big splash. Would this movie have received half the attention it has if Fletcher had been anything near a normal person? I suspect many in the audience might have been bored, and most wouldn't even have weighed in by rating the film.Chazelle's Fletcher commands every moment he's on the screen. All one sees in the members of the band is fear. They don't even look up at him - their faces mostly to the ground, their eyes on the music. Beyond that, there isn't much depth of this story. There are many musical rehearsals and stops, and fits of rage with vulgar and abusive outbursts. These are punctuated at times by some short calm scenes of Andrew with his dad or with his girlfriend, Nicole.If anything, 'Whiplash' seems to cater to the modern phenomena of movie mayhem - constant action, lots of violence, lots of noise and spectacle. Oh, yes, and real crudity. As with so many others, this film has little acting and not much of a story.Did J.K. Simmons deserve the Oscar for best supporting actor? He played the crude, angry, unbalanced tyrant of a teacher very well. How much talent does it take for anyone to vent and spew anger and vitriol? Then, again, there wasn't much competition among actors and roles nominated for 2014. But Simmons and his role as Fletcher surely hold the Oscar record for use of the most foul language, and number of expletives. Apparently, there were about 150 uses of crass language and swearing, and Simmons's Fletcher spewed at least 90 percent of them.And that reflects as well on the writing. The movie didn't win an Oscar for best screenplay or adaption, but it's a sad state of entertainment and Hollywood that it was even nominated. There's very little entertainment in this film, but it is an expose of a mentally disturbed tyrannical teacher and how he affects his students. 'Whiplash' was more of a film about that character than about the star pupil, Andrew.An early scene has a poignant clue of what might lie ahead in the movie. A sign in large letters is posted on a band room wall. It reads, 'If you don't have ability, you wind up playing in a rock band.'",4,6,9,21 November 2018
August Rush," A beautiful look at the connectedness of life
","'August Rush' is a wonderful story about life and love. The reuniting of parents with a child they didn't know they had, and with each other, happens through unknown feelings or senses of the missing person or persons. The vehicle that connects the three main characters here is natural talent for music. In the case of the boy, August, it's an innate musical genius. Something like this may not be as far-fetched as one may think. The medical and other sciences are researching in many fields of human life from conception, to genetics and heredity. New discoveries are pointing to biological connectedness only imagined in the past. This is between parents and children, siblings, and even relatives removed from a direct bloodline. Some studies have found twins separated at birth and adopted out, knowing some way that they have a twin brother or sister. Other studies are looking at siblings who have a sense of a brother or sister who is not alive. As research continues and we learn more about the complex make up of human life, we may one day come to realize that we all are brothers and sisters in the human race. This is a superb story about the beauty and sacredness of all life - not just that of the specially gifted. August shows us that by his observation of others, and amazement for what they do. This is a fine film for the whole family. And, it could be a good learning vehicle if shown in the schools.The film has touches of humor in places. Here's a favorite line. Louis's fiancé is turned off at his family reunion and leaves in a huff. As she drives off, Marshall says, 'Louis, aren't you supposed to be in the car with the girl as she drives off into the sunset?'",8,0,0,26 February 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Just a little piece of Hollywood under the magnifying glass
","'Hail Caesar' is billed as a comedy and mystery, but is mostly a satire of Hollywood. It has very little humor in the dialog, and unless one knows history, much of the plot may not make sense. That includes American history of the mid-20th century, and knowledge about Hollywood in the first half of the last century. With some knowledge in those areas, one can follow the plot and appreciate the humor in the exaggerated scenarios. An example of the latter is when some of the Hollywood communist cell take a small boat to deliver an agent and the ransom money to a Soviet submarine that surfaces off the coast of California. The film covers some of the culture of Hollywood at mid-20th century. But also omits mention of much of it that became known over time. Hollywood had many a scandal over drugs, crime and sex. In the main character, Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), the film tends to idolize the studio head. It puts Mannix on a pedestal for his 18-hour workdays, seven days a week, in which he holds the studio together. So, all of what Mannix does is whitewashed as essential to protect the stars, the studios, etc. One interesting inclusion is Tilda Swinton who plays sisters Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker. They are supposed to be Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, who were not real sisters. They were the famous Hollywood gossip columnists since the early 1930s. The little stories that Mannix has to play them to print or not print pale compared to the real stuff that the two rival columnists produced, publicized, promoted or buried. Other things about Hollywood of the time are barely mentioned or not at all. The assaults and murders, suicides and mysterious deaths, adulterous affairs, alcoholism and drug use, car accidents and many other real troubles that actors got into and that Hollywood tried to covere up. There's no mention here of the sex exploits of some studio heads with young actresses that could determine their careers. Enough real news and exposes have come out of Hollywood since before the mid-20th century, to conclude that Hollywood was a sordid sector of society. So, that's a list of some of the usual goings-on in and around Hollywood at least into the mid-20th century. This film skips or skims over much of that, but not all. It does have a pregnancy out of wedlock that is covered up, with a twist so that it doesn't look exactly like a couple of real instances. Instead, the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, take aim at the mid-20h century. And specifically, the time of the communist scares and type of film output from Hollywood then. It's somewhat of a social agenda about Hollywood kowtowing to the politics of the day. This is where some knowledge of history helps one follow the script. The House Un-American Activities Committee was investigating the influence of Communism in the entertainment field. The period was often labeled the McCarthy era, after Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy who said that communists infiltrated the U.S. State Department in numbers, and were gaining control throughout government. McCarthy had phony lists and in the end could produce very few names in support of his claims.But, public concern was fanned when real Soviet spies were caught or uncovered and Soviet individuals began defecting. This was happening in the U.S. England, Canada and other Western countries. A 1948 movie, 'The Iron Curtain' is the story of a Soviet code worker in the U.S.S.R. embassy in Canada who defected. He provided information that uncovered an extensive Soviet espionage network in Canada and the U.S. It had been stealing American atomic secrets since the end of World War II. In 1953, the U.S. executed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for their spy activities for the Soviet Union. As with most events in history, some people thought the Rosenbergs were innocent or had been railroaded. But much evidence was uncovered in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union that detailed the great amount of espionage they had done for the U.S.S.R. 
 
This time also was at the height of the Cold War when tensions between the Soviet Union and the West were near fever pitch. At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union controlled Eastern Europe. So most of those countries were under communist rule and weren't free until after the 1990 collapse of the U.S.S.R. The nuclear arms race was on between the Soviets and the U.S. Those who lived during that time well remember the air raid drills in the schools. By 1962, the U.S. and Russia would be near a nuclear war when Pres. John Kennedy ordered a naval roadblock to stock the Soviets from installing nuclear missiles in Cuba aimed at the U.S. I can't imagine that people without much knowledge of history would find this entertaining or be able to make much sense of it. As one who remembers the political history, I found 'Hail, Caesar' just somewhat interesting. It was a recap of some bits of Hollywood history. But, it gosed over the real scandals The plot with the studio magnate, Mannix, seemed somewhat contrived. Yet, one could see it was needed to connect the rest of the parts of the film. With very little humor, this movie soon becomes tiring. That's not a very good recommendation for any movie.The funniest line in the film was by Hobie Doyle, the Western star, played by Alden Ehrenreich. Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) asks him, 'How did you get into pictures, Hobie?' He replies, 'Got roped into it.'",4,0,2,27 April 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," A different Orient Express, far inferior
","One wondered if and when someone might take 'Murder on the Orient Express,' and turn it into a modern, fast-action thriller. Well, this 2017 rendition by 20th Century Fox does just that. Only it still takes place in the 1930s. Except for the supposed setting, it's updated to modern production methods as a vehicle to sate the adrenalin rush needs of a chunk of modern society. While the plot resembles Agatha Christie's original, it has a huge cast with many more characters. Among them are a priest, a rabbi and an imam. The Orient Express no longer appears as the exclusive train service it was. The dining car looks like the inside of a fast food restaurant - stark, plain and modern. A funny scene has most of the suspects seated, just one or two to a table, in the dining car. Kenneth Branagh directed this film and starred as Hercule Poirot. Fox and company shot for a big-name cast but couldn't even come close to the 1974 film with the main characters. The only big names of the principals are Johnny Depp as Ratchett, Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard and Judi Dench as an aged princess. Some other well-known stars had new roles created for this film but with no tie to the original. They include Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and Willem Dafoe.Branagh's Poirot appears more to be a dashing 21st century detective with a clownish mustache. The mustache is so outlandish and broad one could hang a hat on either end. Agatha Christie gave Poirot a large mustache, but the one in this film looks more like the horns of a longhorn steer. True to the modern need for speed and action, this one has gun shooting, an avalanche and a derailment, outdoor action around the train, and CGI that all but flashes the message, 'this isn't real.'One can't fault actors for wanting to play in a new rendition of a great film and story. But when the story takes on a different life and the setting departs so much from the feel and sense of original, everyone misses out. The feel of the cast is 21st century, not that of people living in the 1930s. The opportunity to compare performances with those before is lost. The design for this film seems obvious - to garner the viewing and cash of an audience driven by an insatiable desire for action. With the 2010 ITV production that starred David Suchet, and the original 1974 classic films so well done for Christie's novel, it would have been foolish for anyone to try to match or outdo them. But, something different and quirky just might appeal to a different audience. Apparently, this film did that - for some, but not nearly enough to have it rate alongside - or even near the two great productions of 'Murder on the Orient Express.'",3,2,4,14 June 2018
Sherlock Holmes," A fast and furious modern version of Sherlock Holmes
","One can't help but enjoy the performance of Robert Downey, Jr. in this film. His persona, with all its quirkiness, is funny and entertaining. But the idea that he could be the Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's day and writing is a far stretch. The inclusion of Jude Law as Dr. John Watson adds greatly to the plot and enjoyment. Although he's a counter-character to Holmes, he's also adept at crime-solving, shooting and fighting. Of course, all of the latter is mostly out of character of the 'real' Holmes and Watson. For, their brains, cunning and sleuthing were the modus operandi of the original characters.After seeing this film on its release in theaters, I watched it again recently on DVD. It occurred to me that the device used in this film - of short stops in the story with explanations by Holmes almost as afterthoughts, might have been intended to inform (and thereby, better entertain) a modern audience that otherwise wouldn't have grasped the perception that Holmes had for small details. In reading Doyle's stories, one knows Holmes' uncanny deductions from the smallest of details. And in earlier and old-time films, audiences understood this after some comment on details by Holmes. But this modern film seems to have to make the many small details clear as a significant part of the story. After a bit, that seems childish and silly.One other observation is important to note, I think. All of the CGI and high definition filming in this story makes the setting seem unreal - as if created for stage or film. I get the sense of something being unreal often with CGI. But here, the sharp detail and contrasts of black and white in street scenes gives them the appearance of being lifted off the pages of comic books.While I found this film entertaining, it seems something of a letdown in story telling today. Hollywood apparently has to add lots of action in the form of fights, brawling, chases and conflagrations, in order to appeal to modern audiences -- even with classical and historical characters and stories. It's too bad, because with such modernizing of stories, I think the public loses out on the educational aspects of grasping the people, places, cultures and conditions of times past.This is a fast and furious modern version of Sherlock Holmes. For those who enjoy mysteries in more realistic portrayals and conditions, I heartily recommend the wonderful series of TV films of the 1980s and 1990s that starred Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson.Here are a couple favorite lines from this film.Sherlock Holmes, 'It's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.'Sherlock Holmes, after taking a deep breath, 'Ah, putrefication!' (sic)",7,0,1,28 July 2019
Prometheus," Low on the fright, interest and originality levels
","'Prometheus' follows in the string of outer space sci-fi films that are searches for other life. These differ from the space adventure films of the Star Trek and Star War series. In these explorations of distant galaxies, one knows that it's really about monsters. Of course, the 1979 film, 'Alien,' set the standard for terror and fright in space. No one has been able, yet, to outdo that hideous, ugly, frightening monster. So, the constant challenge of sci-fi writers and moviemakers is to come up with something more frightening. Unable to do that - as all have been since 'Alien,' the challenge then is to make the plot more mysterious and intriguing. So, far, the only way to do that has been with more special effects and fictional technical equipment and abilities. This film is loaded with that - the 3-D projections of maps, creatures, etc. and all types of futuristic gadgets and systems. But, in order for those things to hold one's interest in lieu of some fantastic new alien creature, the plot must have some substance. And, that's where 'Prometheus' fails. It becomes just another lackluster sci-fi trip into outer space. Oh, it has a mission, or a couple that may be in conflict, but they are sidetracked in the individual miscues and little tragedies that befall some of the crew. The four stars are for the artists who did the CGI and special effects. They are quite good, even though the story so soon becomes lame. One thing that gets me about most of these movies is how really dumb some of the scientists are. In this one, Dr. Charlie Holloway takes off his helmet - against the advice of his cohort, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw. Why? Because he could read that the atmosphere was safe to breathe inside the unknown structure they found. So, the air makeup is identical to earth, but what else might be in that air? Of course, a real scientist wouldn't think about that. He'd be so delighted that he could take off his helmet to breathe the natural air. But anyone who saw 'The War of the Worlds,' - the 1953 original or the 2005 remake, would know that other things exist in air that might be harmful. And so Dr. Halloway finds out in this film. The dumbness of the guy aside, his metamorphosis turned out to be one of the most interesting action parts of the film. I enjoy sci-fi immensely, and especially that set in outer space. So long as Hollywood keeps putting them out, I'll keep watching sci-fi films. One never knows when one might be particularly good. And those that don't have good fright value or intrigue - well, usually the scenery, CGI and special effects are dazzling enough to keep one from falling asleep. I suspect that the high rating for this film comes mostly from a modern day younger audience. Most probably have not seen some of the classic sci-fi films. But, anyone who enjoys sci-fi from space should at least have seen the three films that are the standards. For aliens from outer space who come to earth, 'The War of the Wolds' of 1953 is the film to see. And, for outer space monsters and fright films, 'Alien' of 1979 is the standard. The one other that tackles time, space travel, advanced civilizations and uncertainty and intrigue about space itself, is the 1968 classic, '2001: A Space Odyssey.'There really have been no new ideas about space since those gems on which to make sci-fi films.",4,1,2,10 June 2018
Casino Royale," Superb film of the raw Bond in his beginning
","Daniel Craig's premiere as James Bond also marked a revision of the character on film. 'Casino Royale' is the first serious production of Ian Fleming's first novel that created agent 007 of the British Secret Service, MI6. Where the tenures of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan had moved more toward more humor in dialog and scenes, this film returns to the original serious and dark nature of the subject and character. This is James Bond in the beginning. It's Bond in the raw, showing his flaws and weaknesses as well as his quick thinking and physical abilities. And, it shows his struggle with the conflicting clashes of morality, emotion, and cold-hearted facts of duty. This film follows the modern trend of nearly non-stop action with several sequences of harrowing physical action and encounters. And, it has the most daring and harrowing personal pursuit of any film to date. That happens in the opening segment when Bond pursues Mollaka in a chase that tears through crowds and buildings, and leaps from cranes in construction sites. Mollaka is played by Sebastien Foucan, co-founder of parkour, a free-running sport that jumps, dodges and hurtles through urban and commercial settings.Bond falls in love in this segment and loses his wife. In later stories - filmed in the past, reference is sometimes made to his having been married before. Roger Craig provides a more ruggedly handsome Bond, a return to the character as played originally by Sean Connery. It was only natural that in later episodes, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan would show a much more polished and even sophisticated Bond. In this revival of the character from the start of the series, it wouldn't seem as natural for Craig to have such worldly taste and knowledge yet as to comment on the vintages of wines. That's something that Moore and Brosnan could do so naturally and believably. The production of this film is superb in all aspects. It clearly is the best of all the Bond films - including those that followed to date. Here's my favorite line in the film. Bond says to Vesper, 'Why is it people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?'",10,1,3,25 May 2018
Saving Mr. Banks," Disney won over author to make memorable musical
","'Saving Mr. Banks' is all about saving the film, 'Mary Poppins.' That is saving, as in being able to make the film in the first place. It tells the story of the culmination of a 20-year pursuit by Walt Disney of English author, Australia-born P.L. Travers for the film rights to her books. She neglected all appeals until, according to the film, her finances dwindled to the point that her London agent urged to meet with Walt Disney at his California studios and to consider again the Disney offer. One can understand that many authors are concerned about Hollywood substantially changing their stores when making them into movies. In this case, Travers was more resolute than most, and obstinate. She didn't want 'Mary Poppins' to be a musical. There could be no animation (as in the short scene with penguins dancing). Mary Poppins was not to be a happy spirited woman, but a stern, serious teacher. Her conditions for granting film rights reached to the level of insisting that no red color be used at all in the film. This movie is the story about Ms. Travers (nee, Helen Lyndon Goff), and how Walt Disney warmed her some and otherwise wore down her resistance. She had encounters with most of the Disney studio people she met, especially the song-writing team of the Sherman Brothers – Dick and Bob. Walt Disney's tenacity paid off and the happy ending of this story is in the wonderful musical that generations to come will enjoy. Without 'Mary Poppins,' we wouldn't have the wonderful songs of the Sherman Brothers, 'A Spoonful of Sugar,' and 'Super‐cali‐fragil‐istic- expi‐ali‐docious.'All of the cast in this film are very good. Tom Hanks conveys the conviviality, decency and hopeful spirit of Walt Disney. And, Emma Thompson is superb as P.L. Travers – or, 'Pamela,' as Walt kept calling her. This movie is a good accompaniment for viewing 'Mary Poppins,' especially for those interested in the source and history of the movie. Here are a few of my favorite lines from this film. P.L. 'Pamela' Travers, 'Poppins. Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.'Travers, 'I fear we shan't be acquainted for very long.' Richard Sherman, 'Why is that?' Travers, 'Because these books simply do not lend themselves to chirping and prancing. No, it's certainly not a musical.'Walt Disney, 'Cancel my morning tomorrow. I'm going to take a ride with my favorite author.' Travers, 'No, no, no! Please, Mr. Disney. I cannot begin to tell you how uninterested – no, positively sickened I am at the thought of visiting your dollar-printing machine.' Walt Disney, 'Well, for crying out loud. When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?' Travers, 'Disappointments are to the soul what thunderstorms are to the air.' Don DaGradi, 'A word of advice, Mrs. Travers, if I may.' P.L. Travers, 'You may. Whether I mind it or not will be another matter entirely. Don DaGradi 'Well, it's just that he can't stand being called Mr. Disney. We're all on a first name basis here. Walt Disney, 'Let's make something wonderful.' P.L. Travers, 'Well, let's see if that's at all possible.' Walt Disney, after she walks away, 'Whoa! Damn!'P.L. Travers, 'Mary Poppins and the Banks – they are family to me.' Walt Disney, 'I understand that – I do.'",8,1,2,24 September 2017
Flight," Washington nails the part of an addict spiraling out of control
","Denzel Washington gives an Oscar-nominated performance as Whit Whitaker in this dramatic thriller. The old adage that driving and drinking don't mix applies even more to flying and drinking - and drugs. Strict federal rules prohibit pilots from drinking alcohol within eight hours of flying. And, their blood alcohol can't be higher than 0.04%. That's half the legal limit for vehicle drivers on roads in the U.S.'Flight' is a film with two stories in one. The first and shorter tale is of an airline pilot who becomes a hero by landing a malfunctioning plane and saving the lives of all but six of the 108 people on board. Indeed, all consider it a miraculous event that no other pilot was able to do in 10 simulated tests of the same airborne crisis.The second is the longer story and is about the life of the pilot, Whip Whitaker. He leads a precarious life. He is divorced, drinks heavily, uses drugs, and has sexual relations with a stewardess about whom he knows and cares very little. He is one angry dude, living an ever increasingly dysfunctional life, and slipping further a further into alcoholism and drug addiction.As the two stories come together, Whitaker exhibits more and more the traits of an alcoholic. The drinking habits of alcoholics differ widely, but many characteristics of drunks are uniform and common. I'm a recovering alcoholic myself, and know the symptoms, behaviors and effects very well. The biggest and most obvious is lying. A drunk will tell lie after lie after lie. And, of course, deny that he or she has a problem. All the time, of course, the problem grows into more and bigger problems. Active drunks and addicts can't relate civilly or socially. They have short fuses and erupt at the smallest things. Many wallow in self-pity. 'Why is everyone against me?' becomes a constant lament. Everyone else is wrong, never me.Denzel Washington plays his part superbly. The only common trait that he doesn't show is paranoia. Instead, his alcoholism is self-delusional to the point of believing that he can drink and shoot up and no one will know the difference. People won't know he's high or drunk. When he confronts the chief stewardess, Margaret Thomason, he says, 'You know me.' He assumes that she knows him for his flying ability at the helm of an airplane. He wants her to attest that he was sober. But she says, 'It's a lie.' She did know him, and knew well that he frequently drank before flights. Whitaker was delusional in thinking that all those who worked around him couldn't tell or didn't know that he had a drinking problem.The movie doesn't come to a full conclusion regarding the plane crash. The audience is left to surmise that the airline and/or plane manufacturer were found at fault for the crash, due to the mechanical failures. Instead, Whitaker's admission of his drinking problem in the investigation by the National Traffic Safety Administration (NTSA), leads to a quick ending where he is imprisoned for his drinking and drug violations. And, Whitaker finds freedom in losing so much, by finding sobriety with the help of others who are also recovering drunks and addicts.This would be a good film for young and old to see and understand the devastation that substance abuse brings on lives and families. But, the use of explicit full female nudity in the beginning makes this film suitable only for very mature adults.The script has an occasional line with wry humor. This seems to be a common aspect of the roles that Denzel Washington plays in many films. Here's my favorite example from 'Flight.' Attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) drives up to Whitaker's farm. As he gets out of his car, Whitaker comes out on the porch with a shotgun. Lang says, 'You gonna shoot me? Can and I come inside?' Whitaker answers, 'Yeah, c'mon inside. I'll shoot ya inside.'",7,1,2,13 November 2018
Shall We Dance," Enjoyable film just for the lessons and dancing
","Miramax made this film after a 1996 Japanese movie of the same title became a huge hit. But this film doesn't have the aura of cultural nonacceptance that the Japanese film had Without that, Richard Gere's John Clark is not so stigmatized to have to hide his taking dance lessons. Of course, he does, but It seems almost awkward and even contrived at times. We know that his wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon) would not be shocked to find out that he is taking ballroom dancing lessons. Nor would his coworkers. So, it comes across somewhat in this movie as though he doesn't want to advertise it because it's not the male or macho think for a man to do. As I said, it seems implied that way. Other than that, I think the characters all are good and probably had much fun making this movie. Paulina's character (Jennifer Lopez) may be just a little overboard. She comes on too strong in her dancing, for what she has experienced. The Japanese actress in that film, emoted a sense of emptiness and loss for her experience. And through the duration of the events there, she gradually recovered. This film is fun to watch, even if some of the plot is a little hokey. It's nothing special but most people should enjoy it.",6,1,1,3 January 2017
Looper," Another mindless time travel film, with more gore
","The first movie about time travel was a 1921 silent film of Mark Twain's 1889 novel, 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.' But it was H.G. Wells' 1895 novel, 'The Time Machine,' that brought the idea of time travel to the fore. Interest in time travel movies has ebbed and flowed over the decades since 1921. The BBC's series, 'Dr. Who' first appeared in 1963 and ran for 26 seasons through 1989. It has since been revived. A series of three American films, 'Back to the Future,' were blockbusters in 1985, 1989 and 1990. Numerous individual films about time travel have been made over the years. But, just as the series and serials have had declining interest and reviews, so have the Hollywood folks run out of ideas for different and interesting plots. The most recent bent seems to be a mix of psychological thrillers with time travel. A spread-out series of three films introduced this sub-genre with 'The Terminator' in 1984, 1991 and 2003. These lack much imagination or plot. It's a simple story of someone from the future going back in time to eliminate someone else. With so little substance in the plot, these are mostly huge chase films filled with violence, killing, destruction and other 'action.' I give all this prelude to 'Looper,' because it fits exactly in this mold. It's just a more recent issue of these psycho-sci-fi films with little substance. The writers tried to come up with something different, at the end. But that couldn't save this film. So long as Hollywood has a market for these mindless products, it will probably keep churning them out. And, if all the actors want is huge paychecks, they're probably satisfied. Too bad there are so few films made today in which people can use their acting skills. Or that challenge viewers with good mysteries, clever comedy dialog, or human interest dramas.As for these fast and furious flicks of nonsense, it doesn't make much difference who the actors are. Just about any kid of 10 years or younger today could act any of these parts. They have daily overdoses of the stuff on their social media electronics and game pods. Man's interest in flight dates back centuries and eventually led to aviation and air travel. It's anyone's guess who might first have thought about or proposed time travel. But, it will be an endless wait for anyone to be able to invent a machine that can transport a person back in time. When one thinks about it, the prospect is quite absurd. Someone could build a machine the size of a car or van that by it's whirring at supersonic speeds would have the power to pull the entire universe back in time? Or, put another way, to turn the clock back even a split second, let alone a few decades or centuries?If planet earth lasts long enough, humans may one day travel to Mars or Venus, or to other solar systems. We may one day find ways in science that are unknown today to travel at speeds measured in light- years per year (about six trillion miles) or faster. But there's no direction to go backwards in time. If you're a cinephile who likes good acting and movies of substance, I recommend that you skip 'Looper.' I was drawn to it by the build-up and Bruce Willis in a lead role. Since it was in the cheap bin at the store, I thought I'd try it. After a couple of duds like this, I've learned to check prospective movie buys more closely. I can wait until I've vetted a film on IMDb and read some of the reviews and outlines before jumping at good deals.",2,0,2,20 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best of the outer space Sci-fi films
","Sci-fi movies set in space don't get better than this or all three of the films of the first Star Wars trilogy. The Star Trek movies are very good and come in second as a group. But this Star Wars film, and the others of the series, maintain a single plot -- good overcoming evil, and it spans a galaxy far beyond our Milky Way.The story, the action, the technical production qualities and all things about Star Wars are fascinating. 'A New Hope' introducers viewers to dozens of alien creatures and characters. The bar scene at spaceport Mos Eisley is a delight to watch as aliens with ant-like heads play instruments, and characters of various strange physical features converse at the bar and tables. The various huge transport creatures that people ride are amazing.Of course, the different spacecraft, ships and flying fortresses are interesting. In short, what's not to like about this wonderful, far-out, Sci-fi adventure film? I can recall taking my oldest children, then six to 10, to see this first Star Wars film after it came out in Late May of 1977. We stood in line outside the movie theater in northern Virginia. Now I enjoy it again, watching with my grandchildren.Here are some favorite lines from this film, 'Star War IV - A New Hope.'Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi, 'Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.Han Solo, 'Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.'Han Solo, 'One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.'Han Solo, 'Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else.'Han Solo, 'I don't know what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.'

Hart's War," Gritty WW II POW film is among the best
","'Hart's War' is a WW II Prisoner of War film based on a novel by John Katzenbach. The film apparently differs quite a bit from the book. It isn't the equal of 'Stalag 17' of 1953 or 'The Great Escape' of 1963. But it comes close, and it introduces a couple of new aspects rarely covered in POW films. Those are interrogation before prisoner assignment to a POW camp, and racism among the American prisoners. The cliché – all is not what it seems, surely applies to this film. Hart's War is a gripping war movie about the Allied prisoners in a Nazi POW camp. I think it does rival 'Stalag 17' for intensity and intrigue. The situations are somewhat different, especially with the racism aspect. It's a solid, dramatic story that includes several issues -- patriotism, freedom, brotherhood, race, betrayal, sacrifice, murder and military leadership. And that's just among the prisoners. The Germans who run the camp don't stand out beyond the commandant. This is a great story that to the very end may have you in doubt, as it did me. Had I known the outcome before watching this movie, I wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much. So, I recommend that those who haven't seen it yet not read reviews that give the plot away. The best appreciation of this film comes from seeing it through the eyes of Colin Farrell's character. As the movie unfolds, we see and associate with his feelings, his dismay, his confusion, his anger and his disbelief. 'Harts War' is a powerful statement about honor, courage, integrity and leadership. No one can ever forget the ending. The cast excel throughout the film. Bruce Willis is the ranking Allied POW – Col. William McNamara. Farrell is the newly arrived POW, Lt. Thomas Hart. Romanian actor Marcel Iures is camp commandant, Col. Werner Visser. Terrence Howard is Lt. Lincoln Scott. Each stands out in his role, and the rest of the cast are superb. This movie makes an excellent 21st century addition for any serious World War II film library.",9,1,3,19 November 2015
Cloud Atlas," Too much crammed into three hours
","This film is nearly three hours long. It bounces back and forth between half a dozen different milieus in as many different plots. And, those are back and forth between past and future generations. The milieu are Hawaii, London, San Francisco, Seoul, the high seas, a place on another plant in our galaxy, and various other places around the globe at different times. If it sounds confusing, well, that's because it is. I doubt that anyone who sat in a theater and saw this film when it came out, immediately afterwards could write down the different scenarios, varying periods of time for each, and who the main characters were of each plot. My guess is that few people could even list half of the plots, characters and time frames. As for messages, this is a very hodgepodge of mores and morals covering family, creativity, sexuality, freedom, oppression, love, a type of pagan faith, and more. Numerous social issues are included in the movie. Among them are murder and mayhem, corruption and killing, stealing and betrayal, lying and cheating, fantasy and sci-fi, oppression and revolution, slavery and racism, tyranny and torture, fame and fortune, pride and power, music and creativity, superstition and mythology.Seven actors appear as six different characters in the various scenarios and time periods. They include Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant and Jim Broadbent. Another dozen actors have three to five roles. Several more have two roles. Perhaps the filmmakers were trying to set a record for a film with multiple roles. They probably succeeded in that.My guess is that the high rating many people give this film is solely for its entertainment in the plethora of scenes, settings, period costumes, and makeup. That and some imaginative camera work and lots of special effects. If those things are one's idea of entertainment, then 'Cloud Atlas' is a winner. But it wasn't a smash hit at the box office. I prefer good stories that I can relate to someone after seeing a movie, with specifics. No one without a photographic memory would be able to do so after watching this film. The various film genres in this movie are mind numbing. There's no comedy, sports or Western, but it has about everything else. Drama, mystery, murder, action, war, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, romance - all are here in 'Cloud Atlas.' Outside of the music, which received widespread praise, reviews of the film varied. It received a standing ovation for its premier at the Toronto Film Festival, but it wasn't otherwise widely lauded. The movie finally topped its $128.5-million budget with worldwide release that netted a total box office of $130.5 million. The movie was based on a 2004 novel by English author David Mitchell. Mitchell said that he doubted a movie could be made of his book. Well, a movie was made. But my guess is that readers of the book would have far more recall and memory about the stories. After all, who could expect an audience to remember much of a 500-page book, with multiple plots, time frames and characters, crammed into a movie of just under three hours?",4,1,5,19 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," More creatures and excitement as the trilogy continues
","Form the overwhelming success of the first Star Wars film ('Episode IV - A New Hope') the movie-going public was chomping at the bit in anticipation of this second film. It came out three years after the first and continued the mystique of the first film. The fans flocked to the theaters, and the critics couldn't heap enough praise on the production.As with the first, special effects are a dominant aspect of this film. The story continues and builds to a nice conclusion that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats in antici0pation of the finale. Of this second film, I especially enjoyed the new creatures that the film introduces. The character of Yoda undoubtedly required more work and ingenuity to film. While Frank Oz was the voice of Yoda, he and several other puppeteers and two dwarf actors created the character and brought him to life.This film probes the moral and spiritual aspects of series and its time and place. The sci-fi aspects that I enjoy the most are the scenes of the Cloud City on the gas planet, Bespin. The vibrant colors in these space scenes are fantastic.This is just a great film in a great series all around.",10,0,1,12 July 2019
Braveheart," Epic film of a Scottish legend
","The characters are real, with some name changes, and many of the battle events are accurate. But beyond that, this film is mostly fictitious. It may not be fair to judge it solely on its historical accuracy. That's because so little actual historical record exists from the 13th century about the hero, William Wallace. So, it's best to enjoy 'Braveheart' as an epic film about a legendary and true hero in Scottish lore.Doubtless, most people enjoy the film for the splendor of its production as well as the legend. The scenery of the Scottish Highlands (much of which was filmed in Ireland), the beauty of the country, the excellence of the costuming (some not very historical) and the staging of very real battle scenes – all make this an epic film. It is not among the greatest of epics – 'Gone with the Wind' of 1939, 'The Ten Commandments' of 1956, 'War and Peace' of 1956, or 'Ben-Hur' of 1959. But it clearly belongs with other superb epics such as 'Doctor Zhivago' of 1965, 'Dances with Wolves' of 1990 and 'The Gladiator' of 2000.The plot of the film is about Scotland's fight for independence from England. William Wallace was a leading patriot in that fight who inspired the Scots to revolt against the foreign rule and oppressive practices of English-backed Scottish nobility. The film is a grand portrayal of that fight. One can leave the historical details aside and enjoy the portrayal of the Scots' fight for freedom that they finally obtained in 1306 under the leadership of King Robert the Bruce. The Scots would survive two wars of independence (1296-1328 and 1332-1357), and remain a free country.Some of the Scottish nobles traded sides and loyalties, as shown in this film. But, most were loyal and fought with the common man to wage the wars for freedom that gained Scotland its independence from England.As the screenwriter, Randall Wallace, says in a 2000 documentary on the making of the film, much of the story they used comes from legend. A particular source was 15th century epic poem by a Scottish minstrel called 'Blind Harry.' The poem is entitled, 'The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Eidersile.' But, besides that, the producers made 'Hollywood' decisions to give the film more glamor and appeal. Some would be drastic revisions of history.Some glaring diversions from here included the queen, Isabella of France, who became the wife of Edward II. She was born in 1295, so was only two years old when Wallace began his fight for freedom. She and Wallace never met in real life. She was 13-years old when she married Edward in 1308 – three years after Wallace's death. She was married to Edward 19 years, until his death in 1327, and she bore him five children, including his successor, Edward III.Edward I, 'Longshanks,' is reputed to have been one of the most ruthless rulers of England. He died two years after the death of Wallace. That was a year before his son married Isabella of France. So, all the parts of the film about her, Longshanks and Edward II are pure fiction. An Encyclopedia Britannica article reports that Edward II may have had relations with men as well as other women and his wife.The Scots under Wallace did invade and conquer parts of northern England, but they did not get as far south as York as shown in the film. After the major defeat at Falkirk, which the movie shows, Wallace disappeared for four years on the continent. He returned to Scotland and resumed his fighting when he was captured.Wallace's execution is one thing that the movie shows accurately – but much less graphically than it actually was. We don't know what was said, of course, but the manner and method of his execution is accurate with recorded details. Perhaps we should have seen more of it to realize the gore and horror of English punishment in that time. After his trial on August 23, 1305, he was stripped naked and dragged through the city by a horse. He then was hung, then disemboweled, then beheaded, and finally drawn and quartered. His head was mounted on London Bridge for a time and his limbs were sent to the four corners of Britain for display and deterrence against revolt. Still, history records that the Scots has the last word with the ensuring victories that established their independence.Of course, all this was more than seven centuries ago. And, in the time since, England has been blessed to have the Scots as part of the U.K. especially fighting on its side in the many wars that followed. By the 19th century, the sound of bagpipes accompanying the march of troops was a proud symbol for both Englishmen and Scotsmen.",10,2,5,8 April 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Rare film these days of a hero of the past
","With more than 600 reviewer comments in October 2017, 'Hacksaw Ridge' doesn't need any more reviews. But, I should weigh in on a couple of points – about the film and its reception. First, the film. I congratulate Mel Gibson for tackling historic subjects in his films. We have far too little of that in the 21st century, yet there is so much modern society can learn from the past. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't seem very interested in telling the stories of heroes and heroics of saints and sinners. In this case, a little known hero, Desmond Doss, is the first conscientious objector in U.S. history to receive the Medal of Honor. Gibson took a 2004 documentary and made an outstanding film about a true hero. My bone to pick with the film is its Computer-generated Imagery. I realize it's nearly impossible in the 21st century to make a war film set just about anywhere during World War II. The places just aren't there to shoot anymore. Nor is there sufficient remaining equipment, machines, vehicles and other materials of the time and period. So, for much of the shelling and action of this film, CGI was necessary. It wouldn't have been so noticeably CGI if Mel Gibson hadn't want to be so graphic with bullets ripping through bodies, legs being blown off, etc. There is so much of that in this film, and it appears so crisp and clear as to be unbelievable, unreal. Our human eyes don't see things most of the time nearly as sharp and clearly defined as CGI presents them. I might have given this a pass except for a few scenes that were so clearly phony. Body parts or other objects from explosions are flung into the air in all directions. Several instances are so obvious drawn or created images with flames coming off of them as they fly rather slowly through the air. It's clear to me that the technical and creative people don't have CGI down pat or perfected yet. There's just too much of this in the film that one can't help be aware of it, so that knocks the film down from 10 stars to nine. The second point related to the film is the Academy Awards and other 2017 recognition paid by the members of the film industry. Desmond Doss was an Army medic who served in the Pacific theater during World War II. The full story of his heroism is much more impressive even than this film shows. Andrew Garfield gives a tremendous performance as Doss. This is truly great acting – which the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTA awards are supposed to recognize. I haven't seen all of the movies with the nominees for best actor, but I did see most. I can't imagine what politics or other things may be at play. That Garfield didn't win the best actor is a true shame on all of the industry groups. I have nothing against Casey Affleck, but his role in 'Manchester by the Sea' had the least demands for acting of any of the nominees. It can't hold a candle to Garfield's performance in 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Again, Hollywood and the industry seem to thrive more on personal popularity, looks or some other criteria.",9,5,8,24 October 2017
The Proposal," A longer period of time and better screenplay could make this a top comedy
","'The Proposal' is a fair comedy, but it's a stretch to call it a comedy romance. Sandra Bullock is a very good actress, and she shows it in her role as Margaret Tate in this film. She does so well convincing the audience that she is a tyrant and witch to work for, that the romantic switch in just three days just isn't believable. And, there's absolutely zero chemistry between the two leads (Bullock and Ryan Reynolds), which cements it as too far out. So, instead of a strange mixture that eventually works in the laboratory of life, this relationship bombs the film.The rest of the cast are good, but no one stands out. The story is an okay one, but had the plot been made to play out over a little more time, with some gradual changes in Tate's character, it would have given the film a more pleasant air of believability. And, Reynolds seems too much the schoolboy opposite Bullock. So, his part either had to change to be a little naturally attracted to Tate in the first place, or they needed another actor for the part.What makes this film at all funny are the occasional funny lines, and the camera work. The production moves nicely from the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple and office life there, to the serene vistas and landscape of Alaska. The latter was filmed on the East Coast of New England.This is one of those films that could have been a comedy masterpiece. Having the story take place over two to four weeks, with more story in a much better screenplay could have put it over.Here are some of the funniest lines in the film. For more dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie.Margaret, 'They are going to make Bob chief. Andrew, 'So, naturally, I would have to marry you?'Margaret, 'They're hunting for terrorists, not for book publishers.'Grammy, 'Well, now, do you prefer being called Margaret or Satan's mistress? We've heard it both ways. Actually, we've heard it lots of ways.' Grace Paxton, 'She's kidding.'Grammy, 'You see the shoes that broad is wearing?'Andrew Paxton, 'C'mon. Let's go. My grandma's moving faster than you.'",5,0,0,22 January 2019
The Birds," Superb special effects in a Hitchcock thriller
","'The Birds' was a film that struck wonder in many a movie fan when it came out. How did they film those bird attacks? Did the birds really attack people, and if so, how did they get them to do that? Or, what kind of special effects could make those scenes seem so real?The film was a smashing success for Alfred Hitchcock who had established his place in film history as a tremendous director and creative movie maker. Most especially of thrillers that often had frightening parts. No one could make such films better. Ironically, Hitchcock never won an Academy Award. But, of the 70 films he directed, he received five nominations. The Hollywood Foreign Press however, bestowed two Golden Globes on Hitchcock. He received a 1958 Globe for his television series, 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents,' which aired from 1955 to 1962. And, he won a Golden Globe for his 1972 film, 'Frenzy.'The cast all are fine in 'The Birds,' and Americans got their first look at Tippi Hedren. Everyone in the cast does a good job conveying a sense of fear or fright about the birds after their first attach. The plot, filming, direction and editing all are superb. The location shots in Bodega Bay, California for scenic and very good. 'The Birds' uses special effects for longer time than any other film movie that comes to mind. It received an Academy Award nomination for special effects for 1963. The various scenes of attacking birds look so real. But they were all shot at the Walt Disney Studios. Disney's master animator, inventor and special effects guru Ubbe Iwerks did the job. The process used different background screens for shooting and then different developing processes. The finished product looks so real because it overlays the shooting of real people and birds. 'The Birds' was the third movie Alfred Hitchcock made from stories by Daphne du Maurier. The English novelist and playwright was one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. More than a dozen movies have been made from her novels and short stories. Besides 'The Birds,' Hitchcock directed two of her earliest novels for the silver screen. 'Jamaica Inn' of 1939 starred Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara, and 'Rebecca' of 1940 starred Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. 'Jamaica Inn' is a crime mystery and thriller set on the Cornwall coast â€“ the westernmost county of England. Hitchcock and others distanced themselves from the film soon after it was made. Apparently, Laughton had bought the film rights from du Maurier, with the intent to use it to promote himself. He had control over the whole film and one can see that his presence overwhelms it at times. His forced changes in the script and his character departed a great deal from the book, and du Maurier wasn't happy with the film. But, the film was a success. Moviegoers didn't seem to mind and may even have enjoyed Laughton's exaggerations and overacting. Anyhow, it was Hitchcock's last film in England, for he went from there to Hollywood. Laughton also went to Hollywood for 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' and he took Maureen O'Hara with him. She had been a little known actress before Jamaica Inn, but 'Hunchback' made her a star. 'The Birds' was what people regarded in the mid-20th century as a good 'date' movie. That's because the frightening scenes would usually lead to a girl nestling close to the boy, and the boy 'protecting' her with his arm around her shoulder.",9,1,2,30 November 2017
Beetlejuice," Exceptional makeup can't save a dull, boring screenplay
","I remembered seeing this movie in a theater when it came out. I recall the good makeup and camera work, but didn't think the story was that good. So, I watched it again these many years later and had the same impressions.The idea for 'Beetlejuice' was quite novel for the time. And there can be little doubt about the superb job of makeup, animation and special effects. And while the idea for the plot had possibilities, the screenplay is very lame. It's a challenge to stay interested because it quickly becomes boring. So much so, that the one very good performance in the film â€“ that of Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, can't salvage the film. The comedy is flat. What little of it I could find was dull. My five stars are solely for the exceptional makeup and artwork that went into the production. It deserved its Oscar for that, but the film otherwise is a dud.",5,1,6,4 February 2017
Draft Day," Realistic look at wheeling and dealing on NFL draft day
","'Draft Day' is quite unusual as a sports movie. It doesn't show any of the cast actually playing or coaching in practice or a game. It does have some film clips of great NFL games of the past. What it's about is the behind the scenes big business of building teams each year during the NFL draft. It includes aspects of caring about players, talent scouts and searches, player agents, owners, coaches and team managers.And, for the realism of this film, it includes scenes that show some of the NFL stadiums around the U.S. Other realism is added with the on-site filming of the 2013 NFL draft in New York City, and scripted reports by TV sports show hosts Chris Berman and others. While some may be put off by the backstage wrangling and big business aspects of professional football, this gives a glimpse of what that must be like. Without the NFL draft to regulate and help level the field for various franchises to build their teams, the sport would be chaotic and probably dwindle to just a few teams that had the backing to afford the salaries and costs. The cast all perform well. Kevin Costner, as Sonny Weaver Jr., gives a real sense of the angst a manager must go through around the time of the annual NFL draft. All of the cast give good performances. I thought it somewhat strange and out of character, though, for Sonny's mother to insist on spreading her husband's ashes on the field on the most trying day of the year for her son. As a football wife and widow, she surely would have waited until the next day. The film has a sense of reality about it. It's refreshing for not being laden with foul language. It has romance without the frequent Hollywood nudity or sex. It reflects the growing modern view of intimate relationships, including having children, with no thoughts or commitments for marriage. Most sports fan should enjoy this film, and others should find it interesting. It may help non-enthusiasts to a little better understand the scope of professional football. My favorite line in the film is Ali (played by Jennifer Garner) telling Sonny, 'There's no such thing as a sure thing. At the end of the day, all that matters is what do you think?'

The Wizard of Oz," A classic fable fantasy for generations to come
","But for several other great films in 1939, 'The Wizard of Oz' likely would have garnered more than two Oscars of it six nominations. Yet, even against giants like 'Gone With the Wind,' which won eight Oscars from 13 nominations, 'Oz' has won certain bragging rights. For, although all of the nominees for best picture that year continue to be shown on TV and watched decades later, none can match 'The Wizard of Oz' for its growing audience. The film wasn't a smashing success in its debut year. It barely covered its budget, where 'Gone With the Wind' and others had huge box offices. But, its re-release in 1949, and then subsequent showings on television soon catapulted 'Oz' to classic status. The technical, costuming, sets, casting and glorious color of this film are fantastic. The special effects, music, makeup and all aspects of production were at the peak of the arts in 1939. With this cast, crew and huge production - it was MGM's most expensive film when it was released, it's no wonder that Hollywood would never again try a new live cast production of this story. This is a wonderful fable, fantasy and adventure movie. It's a classic that families will enjoy for many decades to come.",10,2,2,2 September 2018
High Fidelity," Listless, pointless, and not entertaining
","'High Fidelity' may have some comedy, but in its raucous setting and turmoil, that gets lost. The fidelity here applies to faithfulness in relationships as well as the quality of music. The plot of Rob Gordon's five worst breakups (John Cussack) left me flat. Nor do I find much entertainment in these films in which the star or someone else talks to the camera between bits. It seems an easy and cheap way for writers to switch gears without having to challenge their brains for clever writing and creativity.I suppose some of a young generation who would know some of the music in this film might enjoy it. But, I have no proclivity toward the music. I watched this movie because I wanted to see how John Cussack's comedy was around 2000. This is quite empty. Jack Black is way overboard with his Barry Judd character. But, he's often overboard. Here he's just too loud and crass. The film rightly has an R rating. I can enjoy or appreciate R films if they have character and substance. But this film has neither. So, its profanity, cavalier portrayal of sex and abortion, and listless lives aren't entertaining. Even though a large number of viewers have rated this film, I suspect its appeal has been to a specific group of people. I don't think it will resonate with much of the population 20 or 30 years later, or beyond.The best humor is in the ironic title. Rob's character has been of such low or no fidelity in the past. Now he's jealous and hurt, so the tables turn.",2,0,3,26 January 2017
Atonement," A good story of injustice unredeemed
","'Atonement' is a movie based on a 2001 novel of the same title by British author Ian McEwan. The book and film have three parts, or they wind three stories into one. First, and no doubt the film's big attraction, is a love story. Second, it has a very well done war segment. Third, it is a story about a lie, a grave injustice because of it, and the tragic result in the lives of several people. This last is the wrapping that bundles the three together. One synopsis of the book says it is about 'understanding and responding to the need for personal atonement.' It is that, indeed. And, it shows what happens when one doesn't atone. At 13 years of age, Briony Tallis has a crush on Robbie Turner, the son of the Tallis family's longtime faithful housekeeper. Robbie is treated almost like a son in the Tallis family. He grows up close to Briony's older sister, Cecilia. Briony sees Robbie and Cecilia together in a very seductive scene at the large fountain pool. She later sees them together in the library. Some viewers think that she misinterprets this scene as Robbie raping Cecilia. I rather think it's a clear case of jealousy. Some earlier scenes of Robbie scolding her and not paying attention to her bear this out. Later, the young twins in the Tallis home disappear, and everyone goes looking for them. Briony stumbles onto a scene in which her brother's friend, Paul Marshall, is making love to her cousin Lola. Marshall and Lola had been making eyes at one another since he arrived. Briony runs back to the house and reports that she saw Robbie 'molesting' Cousin Lola. She lies to get even with Robbie, who no longer pays much attention to her and who is in love with her sister. In the film the family seems all too willing to accuse Robbie and not doubt or question Briony. They didn't ask Lola who it was. Robbie returns a short time later having found the twins himself and with one riding on his shoulders. The Family knows that Briony has a vivid imagination in her story telling. Yet they accept Robbie's guilt without question, based on her accusation. This isn't very believable in the film. The truth doesn't come out in a trial, which the movie skips over. Briony would have to have lied again in testimony for the trial. Robbie is found guilty and sent to prison. Now the story begins to take on tones of Briony having regrets over her lie. Her conscience bothers her. She can't deny her guilt, or what happens as a result of her lie. But will she make atonement? As time goes on, Cecilia splits with the family, Robbie is released from prison to fight in World War II, and Briony takes up nursing instead of going to Cambridge. Robbie dies of wounds while waiting to be evacuated at Dunkirk; and Cecilia is killed in a London subway station when German bombs fall on it. We see other scenes as flashbacks of Robbie and Cecilia and Briony. But these aren't real. Briony has made them up as a way to cope with her guilt.The last scene is decades later. Robbie's mother and all the other Tallis people have died. Only Briony is left and she's now a famous novelist. At this point, Vanessa Redgrave plays the 77-year-old Briony. She is going on television to explain her latest book. It's a fictional story she made up about Robbie and Cecilia getting back together. In her TV interview, she tells about her lie about Robbie and its tragic results. Briony lives all of her life with the wrong she has done on her mind, yet she has been unwilling to atone. Why? Atonement means to make amends or reparation to one harmed. That might be humiliating, and it's certainly humbling. But it's necessary for a clear conscience and peace of mind. She didn't make amends to Robbie and Cecilia while they were alive, and she could have at any time over those early years. She didn't atone after their deaths, while Robbie's mother and her own parents were still living. She could have cleared Robbie in their minds and hearts. Again, she had many more years in which to do that. But it would have been humiliating to her. So, she waited, and waited, until she was past atonement and humiliation with those affected.One suspects that Briony was sorry more for her own suffering than for that of all the others she affected. She certainly wasn't atoning – because it was long after being able to make amends to those she hurt. Had she announced that all of her profits and/or her estate would go to help broken families or some other justice cause or worthy charity, it would be a different story. She might have had a statue made of Robbie as a wrongly- accused victim who gave his life for his country. But, there was none of that. Just her word that she hoped her book at this late time in life might bring peace to Robbie and Cecilia – who have passed into eternity. Briony knew she was far too late to make any atonement. And although positing that she is honoring their memory by her fictitious book, she glumly realizes that her lie will be in her memory and on her conscience to the end of her life. Vanessa Redgrave's face in the last scene longs for peace when she will no longer have to live with her lie. For more on this, I recommend the 2008 documentary, 'Bringing the Past to Life; The Making of 'Atonement.''",7,0,0,19 November 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Early 20th century setting for 'The Odyssey'
","'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is a disjointed comedy film that takes place in the American South of the early 20th century. Brothers Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, produced and directed the movie, intending it as a modern version of Homer's 'Odyssey.' The film mixes serious social problems of time and place, with humor and somewhat with a nod to lesser crimes. In an interview, Joel said it was a Three Stooges film. The acting is good, with George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Nelson in the lead roles as Everett, Pete and Delmar, respectively. John Goodman has a smooth-talking violent part as Big Dan Teague. Charles Durning gives one of the best performances as the governor of Mississippi, Pappy O'Daniel. The movie pokes fun at the type of politics of the time, and at the Ku Klux Klan and at good ole Southern religion. The songs and singing are some of the best part of the humor. Some viewers may be put off by the considerable amount of profanity. I noted one thing curious about this movie. It was entered in the Cannes Film Festival in May of 2000, and then released in France on August 30 of that year. It was released all over Europe and elsewhere through 2000, but didn't make it to screens in the U.S. until February 2, 2001. This isn't a movie to rush out and buy. But, it's fair entertainment, with the reservations noted above, for adults on an evening when one doesn't have a great film or more interesting movie to watch.",7,0,1,22 November 2016
