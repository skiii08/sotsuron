The Blair Witch Project," A vain, unimaginative effort to spend as little money as possible to parody a documentary about a nonexistent urban legend.
","The Blair Witch Project (1999) Reviewed January 3, 2014 after 2nd viewing (Blu-ray)A vain, unimaginative effort to spend as little money as possible to parody a documentary about a nonexistent urban legend.Where to start Well, I will preface my review with the following: The first time I saw this, I was scared out of my wits. Why you ask? Probably because I watched it at home in the dark late at night with no one else in the house, I was 16, and I had not discovered The X-Files yet (yes, it was out, but I did not start watching it until 3 months later). Now that I have a lot more knowledge, wisdom, and film expertise, I can see what a tragic cinematic failure it was.The characters have little to offer the film. We barely even relate to them. Heather starts off as this well-to-do, innocent, but headstrong and controlling film student and winds up a whimpering baby. She knows something is out there and her bright idea is to go check it out in the middle of the night with armed with nothing more than a camera and a flashlight? Not so bright OR believable. I grew up camping with my dad (yes, in a tent in the middle of nowhere) in far more remote and scarier places than this, and I can PROMISE you, if you hear a weird noise in the night, the ONLY natural reaction you would have is to a) run to the car and lock yourself in till morning, or if you don't have an easily accessible car, b) stay in the tent, pull the covers over your head, and pray for daylight. You do NOT go venturing out to 'see' what it is when there is no 'seeing' to be had, documentary or not. And her two supporting males? Let's put it this way: I only finally figured out who was Mike and who was Josh when Josh disappeared! They interchanged roles so much between the oversensitive asshole and the pacifist, I couldn't tell who was who, and I cared for neither. Part of the success of a film is portraying believable characters that the audience connects with, and all we're doing is screaming at the screen about how stupid they are. And yes, it's scary, but I kept being taken out of the film by Heather Donahue's OVER-acting. It was unnatural and you could feel it was forced, not gripping and intense the way it was supposed to come off.Plot you ask? What plot? It is nonexistent. So for starters, they never explain why they are trusting some guy they don't even know to go into the woods and camp to make a documentary in the first places. Then they complain about getting wet from crossing a creek What? And did no one else notice that in the beginning, they were only supposed to be out there for a weekend. I counted one night actually, and they got NOTHING. What was on the documentary? Like a few interviews from crazy locals, them in a motel room, them walking, and some rocks they found in a pile? That was in the first 20 minutes of the film they started to go back! Then as what little tension builds does, Heather suddenly decides there must be something in those bound twigs that appeared mysteriously on our doorstep in the middle of the night, so she unwraps it to find I still don't quite know what Fingers? She completely loses it and is hysterical, and yet we're supposed to believe she very rationally decides not to tell Mike? I understand why someone wouldn't—to keep him from panicking so that they both don't lose it—but she's not in her right mind!! That's the point isn't it?! Not to mention Mike just throws the map in the river cause he gets mad! If you're that paranoid about getting lost and that anal about getting back on time, that is the LAST thing you do. Just unbelievable all the way around.As for the director, he was obviously loony when he wrote and 'directed' this. I use the term loosely because he states he instructed them to film everything so that it appears as a documentary. The first 10 minutes are so boring you almost cut the film off. Then there's the matter of camera quality—I mean, come on--even in 1999 it was better than this. And what is with the constant switching from color to black and white? It only serves to distract the viewer and keep the focus off the story. Pick one and stick with it! In all seriousness, not to offer insult to the show in the last because I love it, but an episode of 'Ghost Adventures' is far scarier than this, and at least its NOT fiction pretending to be fact! Each episode documents evidence, history, and fact at a REAL location about a REAL supernatural event. The LEAST the screenwriters could have done was develop a film based off an ACTUAL LEGEND. The lack thereof only serves its intended purpose of creating never- ending loopholes for the directors to do whatever they want and be as minimalist as possible. Their motto: Minimum input, maximum gain. Do NOT be fooled! This film is nothing more than a cheap trick to make a quick buck. I hate to say it, but Paranormal Activity (the first one) did it so much better. *I* could do better if I had a video camera and two friends dumb enough to follow me into the woods based on rumor. EPIC FAIL!!If you're looking for a thrilling supernatural movie, see The Sixth Sense, The Ring, The Mothman Prophecies, Saw, The Haunting, 1408, Devil, Signs, or Dream House.3.0 out of 10.0",3,0,1,8 June 2000
Amistad," A beautiful film about the struggle to keep our most basic rightfreedom
","This film is so moving, I'm having trouble coming up with the appropriate words to describe it. It goes without saying that Spielberg's direction is nothing short of spectacular. I was thoroughly engrossed in the movie throughout. The realism of the scenes on the slave ship speak volumes. And the performances given by Matthew McConaughey and Anthony Hopkins were some of the best of their respective careers. And Djimon Hounsou (Cinque) touched me to the core depths of my heart. The conversation between him and his friend about the Bible was particularly poignant. But I could go on for pages and still not say enough about this film.VERDICT: An emotional and heart-wrenching film that has the power to move the most cynical of hearts. HIGHLY recommended to all.9.0 out of 10.0",9,1,3,14 June 2005
American Sniper," American Propaganda
","Reviewed August 22, 2015 - 1st viewing (Blu-ray 2D) American PropagandaI would like to preface this by stating the obvious: The true story is a tragedy to be sure, however the film unsuccessfully conveys any real emotion or depth. In general I find true stories are harder to adapt, however it is ultimately the director's responsibility to find ways to present the material in such a way that the audience can connect to it, and in this way, it is a failure.From the beginning, I felt like it was abundant clichés about the American soldier, from hunting to a domineering father to the child with a bomb, the latter of which I'm almost certain I've seen in another film. The facts and events of his life are piece mealed together as if you're skipping three pages for every one you see in a photo album. The plot unfolds as if the screenwriters expect you to know many of the important details assuming you'd read the memoir. Chris Kyle, a native Texan aspiring to be a rodeo cowboy, decides to join the military after 9/11. Somewhere his brother gets forgotten until his wife mentions he got deployed to Iraq, where Chris is no less, and yet he doesn't seek him out until one random day he seems him boarding a hilo. Then towards the end they vaguely reference that he was killed and Chris comments that it was his own fault I still didn't understand whether the funeral was for Chris' fallen comrades or his brother. There is such an overwhelming lack of emotional connect, even with Bradley Cooper's amazing performance—a testament to the lack of good writing and direction.The score doesn't fair much better, barely making an appearance other than some numbers with drums during the war scenes as if they accelerate the action. The action sequences (if you can call them that) were quite formulaic and predictable. And the moral of the story certainly does not make an appearance here—I don't understand how Kyle could be so seemingly affected by the kills and yet not have an issue with the killing, never implementing any degree of self-examination or questioning his own personal value system.Then you have plot devices that just don't make sense. After the kid picked up the rocket launcher, couldn't he have settled for shooting him in the shoulder or leg? Why would you set up your sniper on a moving object? Would all the militants in the greater area known your exactly location from one sniper shot echoing off a building where he's laying under cover? If you can't see two feet in front of you in a sandstorm, how can you make a getaway in a Humvee in it? And what's with the supposed air support coming in at the last possible minute? Not to mention the Punisher logo on everything, from the machine gun shield to their clips to their bulletproof vests. Is that really wise in an active war zone—leaving identifiers plastered on everything in sight? They may as well have painted targets on their backs—oh wait! They already did! And let's not forget the American propaganda lurking behind every corner. So all Americans join the military to serve their country and come home numb of the killing with their only regret being they couldn't kill more 'savages' (we're still calling them that?), with no questions whatsoever about the point and purpose, or tactics used on anyone they cross paths with, including civilians? No concern over morality, no qualms with conduct.Eastwood is attempting to be minimalistic, but it just falls flat. He has a visual eye, but forgets the aspects that connect the audience to the material. The camera movement was interesting, however there is no attention to the details surrounding the characters, like who they are and what they represent. I can't help but feel like he's trying too hard in all the wrong places.The most emotional scene was when Chris visited the psychiatrist. I appreciate the fact that they do touch on the importance of veterans being able to seek help and share their experiences with fellow veterans, as I do not feel this is brought out into the light as much as it should be. That being said, in the end he was killed by the veteran he was trying to help. I understand the director finds irony in this, however isn't it completely defeating the purpose of former soldiers not being afraid to seek the help they so desperately need? I mean, that is the end note, so is the moral of the story don't seek help? This is my frustration with films developed from true stories—it isn't enough to just tell the story—the point is supposed to be to find the meaning behind it, how we an make good come of bad.Ultimately, the film did not bring anything new to the war genre, supplanting originality and depth for clichés and propaganda--both of which abound in truckloads. The gravity of how detached and underwhelmed I felt is staggering. The only explanation for the high IMDb rating is that it is based on the concept, not the film or content, the implication being if you don't like this film, you're not proud to be an American. FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad I went with my gut and did NOT see this in theaters The film itself is a tragedy in that it fails to celebrate the man's life, instead settling for propaganda and the ironies of life. If you're looking for a great war film, I suggest Saving Private Ryan or Fury—the depth and emotion conveyed in those films leave you feeling more like you took something important from them and less like you just watched a good man's legacy die before your very eyes 3.0 of 10.0",4,5,14,5 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A vast improvement on Episode I, however still sadly falling short of its potential
","It starts off a little slow, however nicely paced as the audience is anxious to see Anakin and Padme's first encounter after ten years. The next noteworthy scene is when Obi Wan and Anakin are standing outside of Padme's room sharing a very informative dialog. I love when Obi Wan so eloquently jumps out of Padme's window and catches the flying droid. The visuals of the city are breathtaking and the chase scene provides the first hint of some much-needed action sequences, which turn out to be few in number. The next, coming much later, is the flight sequence through the asteroid field, which could've been much more harrowing. This is preceded by the battle scene in the stadium, which was the most visually elaborate and well-written scene in the movie. The shots and sound effects of the light sabers and the guns leave nothing to the imagination. The last of what can be considered action sequences was the fight scene with Count Dooku, Obi Wan, Anakin, and Yoda. This was much less suspenseful as it was more or less predictable. All in all, these sequences were the type that was lacking in Episode I, but they still leave much to be desired.The dialog throughout between Obi Wan and Anakin is fresh and witty, though I would've liked to have seen them together more. Obi Wan using the Force on the creature in the club was hilarious and provided a touch of color. R2D2 and C3PO provided some light comic relief, somewhat reminiscent of the OT. The music is beautiful and perfect for the film, each score fitting the scene in which it appears flawlessly.And while the scenes on Tatooine are beautiful, they remain a bit slow and pointless. The writers seem to be trying frivolously to make it believable that they fall in love, but do not succeed in showing this transition. Throughout the movie, they continually reference when they saw each other last, as if it was then that they fell in love, but Anakin was just a boy, and arguably still is now, so the whole thing just feels contrived. Anakin does not know real love; he has mistaken it for lust, as evidenced by his statement, 'You are in my very soul, tormenting me.' Stop and think, Anakinwhy tormenting?? Love does not torment. Something else not true to form is how Lucas set up scenes with Anakin and Padme that start to show them getting closer, but then he always cuts to something else, like he's just going 'okay, this is how they are, accept it,' and then moves on to more important things. It inhibits the audience from feeling like they're experiencing Anakin and Padme's relationship, and any further character development, as if it's enough to just infer everything. The whole 'I love you' scene towards the end was just unforgivably forced, even with as much as you want to believe in the sentiment. Honestly, it seems to me that Lucas tries to play them as simply being young and dumb, and we're supposed to let it slide for that reason, which still being reasonably young myself, I greatly resent. But I digress.The unique array of transitions between scenes that seem to be a trademark of Lucas' add a little more distinctiveness to the film. The mainly black and white set designs for Kamino make an intriguing statement of how both the Jedi and the Sith view the world as being all or nothing, black or white, with no shades of gray in between.And on a slightly unrelated side note, after watching this film for the first time after having seen Episode III, I got the overwhelming sense that Anakin simply wasn't allowed the space to really find himself, to grow up on his own terms, being so under pressure to stick so strictly to the Jedi code. It seems the Jedi masters do not encourage expression of emotions, most likely because they are not encouraged to have them, but some allowances must be made for having children grow up in the path of the Jedi. All must have the freedom to test their boundaries, or they do not have the opportunity to grow, and to expect this of them, particularly Anakin, is ignorance on their part.And in further exploration of Anakin's character, later on, he makes a statement that greatly evidences his character: 'I'm good at fixing thingsalways have been.' This indicates his strong need to control things, which is something I as well as most people can relate to. But while as we grow, we learn that the truth of the matter is that control is an illusion, as is power. But Anakin was not allowed the room to grow and so focuses outwardly, trying to control tangible things, all the while without the ability to even control himselfthis is his quintessential flaw. So in a very sad way, he loses himself before he ever really discovers himself.VERDICT: All in all, of the prequels, this one felt more balanced, however it fails to excel in any particular area. In general, it is a bit slow, but it maintains interest throughout. Ultimately, what I feel this movie (as do all three of the Prequels) lacks the most is adequate character writing and development. It's more inferred than actually shown, which is severely detrimental to the movies as the characters are the heart of the series. You get the feeling that the creators were more concerned with the graphics and fight sequences than anything else. It should be noted that it is clearly a *big* improvement on Episode I, but still not on par with the original trilogy. Recommended to allit is definitely worth your time and money, but do not expect perfection.8.0 out of 10.0",8,2,4,9 June 2005
Southpaw," A dark, gritty, emotional journey that captivates and inspires
","Reviewed July 26th, 2015 after 1st viewing (Theatrical 2D) Escape Artists / Fuqua Films - Directed by: Antoine FuquaAntoine Fuqua does it again! This dark and gritty story is a prime example of how you must sometimes necessarily fall to rise. Southpaw (2015) is the tale of a young boxer by the name of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) who along with his lovely wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) came up in the system together. Rachel McAdams as his wife and Oona Lawrence as his daughter do a fantastic job pulling on your heartstrings. They really worked as a believable family dynamic, with Maureen always being responsible for running their daily activities and his career. Your heart is truly broken by the end of the first act. I cannot speak highly enough of Oona's performance—I was truly captivated by her.After losing it all, he seeks the help of a local trainer (Forest Whitaker) trying to make a difference in affected youths' lives. Hope must learn how to set aside his vanity and pride for the sake of his daughter, and embarks on a life-changing journey to reconnect with his daughter. I really found his daughter's displacement to be equally heart-wrenching and believable.Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Hope is nothing short of impressive, choosing to train extensively not only for the physicality of the role, but for the emotional depth as well. Fuqua's direction serves to convey the realism and grittiness of their lives, truly captivating the audience from the beginning. The interplay between the score and soundtrack surprisingly works well. The pace is just right, never slowing down enough to cause you to lose interest. I was truly surprised at how emotionally invested I was early on, which I attribute largely to the acting talent.Even though it is a bit formulaic, it winds up being irrelevant, as you are on this ride with Hope the entire way, rooting for him all-the-while knowing he will get there with his determination. The film actually works on a number of levels, drawing and maintaining your interest whether you for the boxing and the soundtrack or the human interest story, it was masterfully rolled into one dynamic.FINAL VERDICT: I was truly amazed at not only how the film captured my interest, but my heart—even when I knew what would happen in the first act. All of the elements came together beautifully, and I wound up loving what I expected to be a mediocre boxing film. There's so much more than meets the eye here.8.0 of 10.0",8,0,1,6 September 2015
Ant-Man," Entertaining and yet underwhelming with a side of predictability
","Ant-Man (2015) Reviewed August 15th, 2015 - 1st viewing (IMAX 3D) Marvel Studios / Disney - Directed by: Peyton ReedEntertaining and yet underwhelming with a side of predictabilityFrom the beginning, I was thrown off kilter by the uncharacteristic opening, lacking the Marvel theme with the logo. It opens with a comedy of sorts which kind of felt like they were trying to blend the humor and wit of Guardians with the seriousness of the Cap films, but it fell flat for me. The slow beginning served to take me out of the film, wondering when it would pick up. It all felt like it'd been done before to a point, and a lot of the humor was lost due to scenes being present in the trailer.For months I have been trying to figure out how Paul Rudd got cast, but now I see the character he plays is in line with his usual roles. Despite wanting to like the film, he was just lacking in charisma. Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly were captivating, and stole the show in my opinion. I was more interested in their dynamic than anything going on with Scott. I mean, let's face it—the wayward father who wants to make his little girl proud has been done before. I know they were trying to make it feel modern, but it falls short. The villain is you can call him that was so two-dimensional, predictable, and boring. I can't help but feel the writers hoped to rely on the comedic relief to carry the film over the plot hurdles instead of developing the character more.Although I appreciated the Discovery Channel-style dialogue regarding different species of ants, Scott learning how to use the Ant-Man suit and work with the ants felt a bit rushed. The scene with Hank and his daughter Hope was moving, but lacked the degree of emotional depth required to truly draw us in and feel what they felt. (I didn't even tear up even though I wanted to). To be fair, it did evoke some emotion from me in that I laughed in places, but I just couldn't help feeling as though the writers did not take the time to polish this one out enough. It is also largely lacking in dynamic locations and a dramatic score, instead opting for more contemporary songs. This model can of course work as in Guardians, however everything in this film is entirely too disjointed to feel like the well-oiled machine it was intended to be.You're left with a sneaking suspicion that the writers and The First Avenger and Guardians attempted to collaborate ideas for the direction of the film, and had to agree to disagree. It seems very disjointed at times, floating between you being expected to take it with a grain of salt to imploring deep emotion from you that just seems altogether forced. I expected the 'revelation' for what became of her mother—you could see it from a mile away, as well as the post-credits scene, but at least with Red Wasp, we'll have a more dynamic character to look forward to.So while the film does leave you feeling entertained, it fails to provide the power, emotion, and scale we've seen in previous Marvel productions. (This marks the first Marvel film I only saw once in theaters.)FINAL VERDICT: Humorous and entertaining, albeit a bit predictable and forced. Even though it was still a decent film with its own moments, in my estimation, it is the least memorable from Marvel Studios to date.6.5 of 10.0Rant: Falcon in the trailer! Come on Marvel! Talk about a cheap shot to try to gain box office numbers. I will not be tolerating any of that nonsense for Civil War. That is a reveal that should've only been earned by the fans who went to see it Advance/Opening Day.",7,2,6,6 September 2015
The Aviator," Surprisingly emotional and provocative
","Now, to be honest, I really didn't expect to like this movie that much. Sure, I knew it would be a good, well-directed movie, but I generally don't care much for biopics short of their educational value, but I couldn't help but become engrossed in the movie, and I feel that was largely due to Leo DiCaprio's acting. I can't say that I know much about Howard Hughes at all, short of what's in this movie, so I have no frame of reference for the material. Despite that, I really felt as though I was taking this journey with him, and could really relate to his turmoil. The whole cast was astounding, notably Kate Beckinsale and Cate Blanchett. About halfway through, it seemed to become a sort of emotional vacuum, as if it drew my feelings right out of mevery impressive. VERDICT: A very wholesome movie that impressively succeeds in taking the audience on a journey with Howard Hughes. Recommended to anyone interested in true stories, aviation, or simply a good, wholesome drama with a twinge of action.8.5 out of 10.0",8,0,0,9 June 2005
The Village," Can we say propaganda?
","Can we say propaganda? Personally, I feel that M. Night Shyamalan's name was attached to this movie for sole purpose of enticing everyone and their dog to go see it. One of the main purposes of the film medium is to communicate a message or messages to those that watch, but a message is only effective when the viewers are receptive to it. You do NOT advertise a movie as a scary horror flick and then try to make a profound statement to the viewers and expect them to hear it. Knowing M. Night Shyamalan's work and style, I wasn't just expecting a good scare, but an *intelligent* scare. I found neither of which. The plot was very poorly structured, the dialogue was weak and the whole concept just felt forced not to mention it's been done before. What I keep coming back to is that not only does this movie lack Shyamalan's stylistic touch, but it lacks substance. I just felt it to be very hollow, and maybe that's because it wasn't what I expected, but I do not feel that Shyamalan brought anything new to the idea. The whole point of this movie could've been communicated in three sentences--it was not worth the hour and a half of my life I lost.
And not to say this was a horrible movie, just very mediocre and lacking. I would've never thought that Shyamalan did this movie--he had a point, but didn't know how to make it, and as such, the movie is just lost on everyone. The one thing I would say to those who haven't seen it is that if you're just looking for a good scare, you WILL be disappointed; this is NOT the intelligent thriller it's made out to be.5 out of 10",5,0,0,2 August 2004
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission: Realism (with a flat affect)
","Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) Reviewed July 31st, 2015 after 1st viewing (IMAX) Paramount Studios - Directed by: Christopher McQuarrieMission: Realism (with a flat affect)From the beginning, I was impressed by the pace and flow of the film. The director (Christopher McQuarrie) took the ballsy move to develop the angst, making the action sequences all the sweeter. The decision to promote the film using primarily the airbus sequence, which is the pivotal opening sequence with the desired (and successful) effect of gaining the audience's interest, was a smart one. This enabled us to sit back and enjoy the rest of the film without anticipating certain scenes. I also loved that the title sequence remained in true MI form, not pandering to the current stylistic and contemporary designs. The combined use of practical effects and Tom's commitment to his craft by doing as many of the stunts as possible lend a realistic quality to an otherwise outlandish film.This time around, Ethan (Tom Cruise) must work to prove the existence of The Syndicate after the Senate shuts down the IMF, with Benji (Simon Pegg) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) left to help surreptitiously. I enjoyed the reintroduction of Luther (Ving Rhames) and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, who managed to quite successfully portray a new archetype than previously seen in a MI film—more independent and honest, which allowed for us to see her as more of a real, complex individual as opposed to yet another seductive female stereotype. The plot flowed well enough, slowing down just enough to allow the tension to build without leaving us with too much down time to contemplate the plethora of possibilities for who the real villain might be. There are just enough twists to keep you distracted while they implement their own slight of hand, always keeping you guessing. Renner as Brandt was enjoyable to watch, opting for a less-is-more approach that felt organic in its own right. I appreciated that there was not an overabundance of action for the sake of action, and instead the filmmakers opted to slowly build the suspense, effectively making us work for it—a very bold tactic that you do not see much in action films these days. To me, it spoke of their confidence in the material and allowed me to appreciate it all the more.It did get a bit predictable toward the end, however the improvised plan was original enough, entailing a degree of entrapment I hadn't previously seen done before. One of my favorite moments toward the end was that for once, Ethan's relationship with his female counterpart was grounded in mutual interest and respect, not lust and sexual attraction. The writers have gone with the times and finally represented a strong female lead that doesn't have to be inserted merely as eye candy, and I greatly appreciate the mature treatment. As much as I am a fan of the MI series, that has been one of my biggest irritations in the previous films, so kudos to the writers and Tom!FINAL VERDICT: A worthy successor to Ghost Protocol, the action sequences and original script successfully breathed new life into the film, however the decision to be more realistic left the film feeling flatter than its predecessor.8.0 out of 10.0IMAX NOTE: There is a unique opening countdown sequence I've never seen IMAX do before. It was a great way to get us excited before the opening sequence even began (despite the fact that it was not filmed in IMAX, it showed quite well).",8,0,3,6 September 2015
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Somewhat lacking
","I went into this movie aware of the fact that the 3rd book was a bit darker and different than the first two, but I still came out disappointed. (And FYI, I haven't read any of the books, so please excuse my inability to compare.)As such, I had no qualms with the movie being a bit darker, for that was a welcome change and a way to take the series to a new level. But my first overwhelming thought was that the movie seemed very choppy, like a segment would start and I'd think it would be building to something and then it'd jump somewhere else, and I kept thinking, 'when is something significant going to happen?' It also seemed as if it was dumbed down a notch, almost as if several subplots were left out so as not to confuse us. But nonetheless, I still wound up being confusing with the whole 'Serious Black isn't actually the bad guy' reversal. It was so abrupt, if you blinked, you'd miss it. And personally, while the back-in-time thing was well-written, I felt it was a bit beneath the intelligence of the series (and yes, I realize it was in the book, so I don't suppose one can fault the movie for that).On the whole, there was nothing really extraordinary in the film. Sure, it had it's moments, such as the seasons changing as the owl's flying and I really liked the Hippogriff, but to me the CG looked a bit different and on the whole it had a very different feel, and while I'm sure that can be contributed to the new director having a different style, it didn't seem to encompass that lasting quality that the first two had.I think the biggest disappointed to me was that I was kinda glad when the movie was over. There weren't any parts that I particularly enjoyed, nothing that stood out. I think my biggest enjoyment was seeing the characters older and the young actors growing in their abilities. Ultimately, I went into the movie not expecting much and came out feeling like I'd done little more than see the characters two years older.6.5 out of 10",6,2,3,5 June 2004
Inside Out," A fresh and provocative look at how our emotions affect our daily lives
","Inside Out (2015) Reviewed August 15th, 2015 after 1st viewing (Theatrical 2D) Disney / Pixar - Directed by: Pete DocterA fresh and provocative look at how our emotions affect our daily livesI will admit that while I was hesitant to see this due to the unimpressive trailer, I was pleasantly surprised that it was deeper than I expected.Pete Docter succeeds in drawing you in from the beginning, introducing the characters as they are introduced to Riley as an infant. It was thoroughly engrossing to learn of the core personality elements and the artistic way they were visualized conceptually, making for a thrilling watch. There are of course some flaws here, namely that I feel the dissolution of her core personality traits happened altogether too fast, not to mention I don't ascribe to the belief that these core elements can be lost altogether, but I'll digress here. And, I love that she was a girl who enjoyed hockey—well done on that point Disney.I found the incorporation of her long-lost imaginary friend to be a welcome surprise. As we journey deeper into her mind, the film takes an underwhelming turn, making it wholly unbelievable each of the islands would be collapsing so quickly, and that they'd be so difficult to get to, as if the writers weren't sure how to sustain the second act. I found myself a little displaced here, quickly losing interest as it seemed a bit too predictable. I do feel as though they did not do the other emotions justice, speaking from personal experience that learning to appropriately deal with anger and fear and just as important.The third act picked up considerably; I enjoyed the void of forgotten memories, the wagon, and the weight of the decision that Bing Bong has to make. I also thoroughly enjoyed the exploration of the purpose of sadness, teaching kids and adults alike that not only is it okay to be sad, but that it can be therapeutic and allow new bridges to be built and bonds to be made.Overall, I found it enjoyable with an important message, but I can't help but feel they could have explored personality more, and the differences between each individual as opposed to a quick montage at the end that did incorporate some stereotypical elements. It is a tad frustrating that I was left feeling like some material was intentionally not covered to leave room for a sequel, detracting from my overall enjoyment.FINAL VERDICT: While I appreciate the originality and boldness of the idea behind the film, I do think they could've explored other traits and the other emotions a bit more. Not to mention that now that I've heard the message, there is little rewatch value here. Ironically, it is lacking any memorable moments in deference to the subject matter. I appreciated the concept more than enjoyed the film itself, but I do greatly respect the effort that went into presenting such provocative material in a way children can understand and relate to.7.5 of 10.0NOTE: The short 'Lava' at the beginning of the film was AMAZING—I actually felt the weight and emotion of that more than most of the film—I was crying a minute and a half into the short.",8,6,30,6 September 2015
Batman Begins," Now THAT'S how it should be done!!!!
","I just returned from the midnight pre-screening of Batman Begins (2005) at my local theater, and the adrenaline is *still* coursing through my veins!! What a rush!!To start, let me say that about three weeks ago, I rented Batman (1989), and let me tell ya, that film is fatally flawedI'm not even sure it qualifies as a film. To me, it was like watching a comic book in real time, and while I can see the appeal of this for some of the fans of the comic books, this will not suffice when making a film.Now, that being said, Batman Begins (2005) is as close as you can get to a perfect film acquiring its source material from a comic book, and *this* coming from a huge fan of both the Spider-Man and X-Men movies. Granted, I love those movies and their some of my all- time favorites, but they're not even on the same playing field as this! Not knowing anything of the comic series other that it exists, this is *exactly* what I desired to see when I first saw Batman (1989). And unlike that film, this movie does not intend to put on a show, but succeeds in making you *feel* the story. Bruce Wayne is incredibly well- written, and it's especially insightful to see flashbacks of when he was a boy.The wry, sardonic humor is well-suited for the film, lucratively enhancing its dark atmosphere. The crowded theater housing 250 movie-loving citizens laughed simultaneously throughout the entire course of the film. The director expertly articulates his tightly-wound vision, compelling a film full of depth and personality to the big screen. Christian Bale was eloquent in manifesting a dark, wounded BatmanI don't believe anyone else could've done better. Through the course of the film, I truly believed in Batmanthat he was real and existedthat's how impressive his performance is. It was great to see Liam Neeson in another role, and he does well with the scant material he's given. Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes fill out exceptional supporting roles, both portraying their respective characters so well, you really get a sense of who they are.Even though most of us have seen four Batman movies, this film stands alone because despite that, you truly feel as if you're experiencing everything for the first time, as if the material's new and fresh, and this is primarily because it is so perfectly presented in this manner. From his first encounter with bats and how they've become a sort of demon he must continually exercise, his father's contributions to Gotham City, his family history and associations, the source of the one-of-a-kind weaponryeverything is just so thoroughly intriguing and enlightening in a way that you can't quite put your finger on. We learn not only why he is who he is, but how. By the end, I left feeling oddly inspired and almost on a high of sortsit was strange and yet refreshing in a way that I've never felt before.VERDICT: Thoroughly engrossing and executed with precision and stylea milestone amongst all predecessors. HIGHLY recommended to all, whether you read the comics or not, whether you saw the originals or not, and even whether you like Batman or not. Set aside any and all notions you have, and do yourself a favor and go see this oneI PROMISE you won't be disappointed. This is NOT just a movieit's an experience.9.5 out of 10.0~AleXa~",10,0,1,15 June 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," A thrilling and mind-blowing ride through the mind *and* the heart
","First, it should be known that I am a die-hard Matrix fan and absolutely loved this movie, however, there are some things they could've improved upon.The most obvious discrepancy is that there is too much pace contrast, and by that I mean an action-packed martial arts scene immediately followed by a slow-paced scene where either Neo is learning something new about himself or the Matrix or someone is explaining the function of something in the Matrix. The slow-paced discussion scenes in and of themselves are entirely too drawn out, and insult the audiences' intelligence to a certain extent. So while the film feels balanced, the flow and development of suspense are disrupted.One thing I loved about the first Matrix so much was the fact that everything was put into actions and you figured it out for yourself, but this one was like a plethora of information being served to us on a silver platter, excluding the last twenty minutes or so, but I'll get to that later. The constant tug-of-war between awesome special effects action sequences and the slow, lingering discussion scenes gave the movie a sort of seesaw effect that was a little disorienting, especially to the casual viewer.While I fully acknowledge that the fight scenes were absolutely remarkable, I was somewhat surprised at how incredibly obvious the CGI was. I realize it wasn't used half as much in the first one, but it was seamless. I wasn't expecting anything approaching perfection, but the obviousness of it surprised me.However, these discrepancies are slight and can be easily overlooked. The thing that bothered me the most was that I feel the Wachowski brothers cheapened Neo and Trinity's relationship. While they maintained the true love theme, I found their relationship to be way too sexual. It was as if they were one of those barely-been-dating-can't-keep- their-hands- off-each-other couples, which was so completely out of character for them.I also feel that the Zion scene was completely unnecessary. Granted, that was something that I think most of us fans were looking forward to seeing, but all we got was that drawn-out, techno club scene paralleled with the Neo/Trinity love-making scene. It was understandable to a certain extent, but they took it just past that toleration point that made it drag. It was just too much. And to that end, when Neo brings Trinity back to life after catching her from her 30-story fall, they grab each other and kiss as if their mouths were magnets for each other, and I was briefly dissuaded into thinking I was watching a soap opera! I realize that that's a bit extreme, but it was so melodramatic, it was ridiculous! It completely ruined the moment for me.One more thing that's not really of great importance but more of an observation is the fact that it doesn't seem to me that Trinity is as kick-ass (for lack of a better description) as she was in the first one. She seems to get hit a few times or sent to the ground every time she fights, and not to mention the fact that an agent takes her out. It may seem irrelevant, but I just feel her character is stronger than that.Furthermore, I feel that there was too much new information introduced at once. Think about it--the Oracle is not the Oracle, but a program created as yet another means of control, the prophecy's not true, there is no 'The One', Neo not only didn't kill Agent Smith, but a part of Neo was imprinted on him so that he can duplicate himself, there are back doors to all the programs in the Matrix that can only be locked and unlocked by the key maker, and Neo is an anomaly that is currently recurring for the 6th time.Not only that, but there was too much dialog contained within the parameters of too long a slow-paced explanation. For example, the parallel editing between Morpheus going over the plan with the other two captains and their crews and the actual action of the plan ruined the suspense. It's appreciable to a certain extent as it does begin building suspense, but once again, they take it one step too far and pass the point of toleration. It's more frustrating than anything else.Now don't misunderstand me; I love the Matrix series for its aspects and levels--the inherent complexities, the deep provacativeness of it, the fact that it reaches so many people on so many different levels. The Wachowski Brothers are eloquent in incorporating their views on society, government, politics, humanity, and the world in general into one movie series. It's the absolute best of everything--action, adventure, suspense, romance, science fiction, special effects, martial arts, witty but smart dialog, strong characters, as well as a mind- bending revolutionary concept.I love how Neo is so genuinely terrified of losing Trinity every time he so much as looks at her. I not only love Neo's 'superman thing', as Link so eloquently put it, but the fact he caught Trinity as she was plummeting to her death--that was so indescribably awesome!! But what I really love more than anything is that Neo's love for Trinity runs so deep, it fuels his power a million times over.And while I am greatly compelled to argue that it was a bit too cliché to have it all come down to a choice between saving all of humanity and saving Trinity, you can't really put that bounds on the Matrix because of the superb uniqueness of it, and because of the way that it was built up. It's very ingenious, because when you would normally call it predictable, it becomes poetic in its own way.VERDICT: Powerful and thrilling film. Visually mastered, action-packed...a perfect blending of many genres and themes. My hats off to the Wachowski Brothers...I can't say enough. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL.9.5 out of 10.0",10,0,0,16 May 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Stylish action and classy wit, but still a loose bag of sorts
","******************** PROLOGUE: I've heard a lot of people say that they either don't want to see this or think it will 'suck' because of the rumors circulating around Brad and Angelina Grown adults saying this. I'm barely out of my teens and I'm not that shallow or judgmental. What business is it of ours what they do with their personal life?? It certainly has nothing to do with the quality of the film, and in an ideal world, should have nothing to do with whether we see it or not. And I'm speaking as someone who considers Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, and Jennifer Aniston as three of her all-time favorite actors/actresses. Rumors are just thatrumors. So open your mind, see the movie, and judge (the film) for yourself. But to each his or her own I'm stepping down from the soap box now. ********************As much as I wanted to love this movie, I must admit, I came away a *little* disappointed. On the whole, it just felt a little haphazard, but then again, maybe that was intentional. But don't get me wrongit was highly entertaining and a fresh and energized action movieaction mixed with humor makes for some of the best movies, and I don't think I've ever seen one where the two come together as seamlessly as this. I was laughing throughout pretty much the entire movie, even in the midst of the shooting and explosions. I'm sure I don't have to point out that Angelina and Brad have sizzling chemistry, and it was fun just to watch them interact. Still, the film *did* feel a little loose. The background story on the two opposing agencies was kept vague as well as a few other minor plot points which keeps the film from feeling solid.Angelina turned in a better performance than Brad, showing us a vulnerable side to her character that convincingly seemed to finally have been stripped away after five or six years of secrecy. Brad did a fine job as well, but I felt more of Jane's turmoil than John's, which arguably is fitting to his character as he tends to be a bit passive. And to that end, I'd like to point out that I thoroughly enjoyed the minor detail of their respective weapons of choice matching their personal styles. Jane, being the more dominant and bold of the two, always has the big oozies and machine guns, whereas John, being more passive and malleable, usually carries your more standard hand guns.The biggest problem I had with the movie was the open-ended endI think the makers had it in them to come up with another, more conclusive scene that could've given the movie some much-needed tautness.But these on the whole are only minor discrepanciesthis is without a doubt one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year. And FYI, this film held up to my second viewing standardsI laughed just as much if not more upon the second time around.VERDICT: A success in making a refreshing action movie filled with plenty of both explosions and punch lines, but a little lacking in story and direction. Highly recommended to all looking for a wild ride in the midst of recent box office duds.7.0 out of 10.0 (Original rating)*** 7.5 out of 10.0 (Rating after 2nd viewing) ***",8,1,5,10 June 2005
Speed," My all-time favorite movie
","This movie was awesome! It has a very suspenseful plot, good characters, and excellent special effects. To sum up, Annie (Sandra) is your average working gal, who happens to take the bus on the most inopportune day-the day a bomb is planted on it. This bomb was planted by a terrorist who was attempting to get back at an LAPD cop named Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) because Jack had screwed up his scheme to blow up about 8 people trapped on an elevator. The terrorist tells Jack which bus has the bomb and he gets aboard the bus, when a Hispanic guy freaks out and shoots the driver in the shoulder, causing Annie to become the driver. This is how Jack and Annie meet. They travel all over L.A., as the bus has to stay over 50 mph or it will explode. Jack pulls some pretty daring stunts in an attempt to save the passengers of the bus. Again, this movie has a terrific plot and I honestly think that you would really enjoy this movie.VERDICT: Awesome action movie with a little bit of everything, not to mention two of my favorite people--Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. HIGHLY recommended to everyone.***More descriptive edit coming soon***",10,0,0,4 December 1999
Thor: The Dark World," Simply spectacular...
","Thor: The Dark World 9.5 out of 10.0Simply spectacularTo start, the Marvel superhero franchise is the one of the few second only to Pirates of the Caribbean, to figure out how to make a captivating film. By the end, they leave you with a feeling of breathlessness and exhilaration that is rare to find in movies these days. You feel as though you were with the characters on their journey, felt what they felt. They accomplish what any great film should—to make the audience feel as though they lived the movie for those two hours. Those kind of films excite and inspire me in a way that cannot be described, something rare that you cannot put a price on.Thor: The Dark World manages to do just this quite effortlessly (so to speak). The characters in my opinion are the backbone of the film, and they are beautifully written and portrayed. Particularly if you watch its predecessor beforehand, you can see the evolution and development of the characters. Thor has learned humility and sacrifice, and to deal with a pain brought on too soon. Loki is evolving as well, and it is exciting to watch Tom Hiddleston deliver a performance that opens your heart to what may arguably be the most well-written antihero of all time. Loki is so conflicted, torn between his heart and his drive for power, continually struggling to control the onslaught of emotions swirling around inside him. Always sly and manipulative, he finds an advantage and a witty retort for every tense situation. Even though he is devious and cannot be trusted, the pain and torment he endures pulls at your heart, and like Thor, you just can't help but hold onto a glimmer of hope that he is still in there and can be reached. This film offers both answers and questions to where Loki's true allegiance lies. Without revealing too much, it is absolutely marvelous seeing a little piece of the good inside bubble up to the surface. The direction was a nice change of pace with Alan Taylor taking over for Kenneth Branagh. Usually directorial changes are at the detriment of the sequel, but not so in this case. He gives the film a feeling of depth and a much broader scope than the first. It's visually stunning, and only wish we got to explore Asgard a little more. The CG is *far* improved in this one as well, lending itself to helping the audience submerse themselves.The transitions from action to drama to comedy were so quick and yet so seamless. It is a testament to the screen writing that we can feel engrossed the pain and loss in one scene and then laughing in the next.I also love that Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo as Frigga got more screen time. I only lament that we did not get to see Thor, Loki, and Odin fighting side by side, but perhaps such novelty is reserved for the third installment.Furthermore, I also find fascinating that in theory, the anti-gravitational fields caused by the convergence offer an explanation to otherwise unexplainable things that happen in our own world, and as they state, may be another offering to the fact that in some cases science fiction turns out to be science that we had yet to understand. There is an intelligence and curiosity involved in this film that was grossly lacking in the first.The one complaint I would say I probably have is the lack of character development of Jane Foster. She seems to just be kind of there, with no particular conflict other than the Aether running through her veins. She does show strength, but for the most part is portrayed as nothing more than a woman pining after a man—well, Thor that is. I also thought there would be more of a complication regarding removing the Aether from her without killing her. Furthermore, Dr. Erik Servig's eccentricities I think were a bit over-exaggerated, but it brought humor nonetheless. One could also argue that more elaboration should have been offered regarding Malekith and the Dark Elves, but being as though there were so many shades of gray and eccentricities surrounding Loki that were far more fascinating, there is much less need for it.And I'm not sure if it was just me, but despite all the overall success of the execution of the film, I couldn't help but feel as though some scenes were cut out. It seemed as though we missed something in Asgard with Thor and Jane, and also the bifrost was destroyed and now suddenly it's just there with no explanation?There is a transformation starting to take place in this film as it evolved from the first, and I can't wait to see what direction they take in the next one. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to last waiting two years to see what happens next9.5 out of 10.0-HM",10,5,10,9 November 2013
Cloud Atlas," Jumbled conglomeration of The Matrix intertwined with Amistad and Apocalypto that piggybacks on abolition to succeed in driving its message home
","Cloud Atlas (2012) Reviewed February 6, 2014 after 1st viewing (Free HBO HD) - Warner Bros (boo) – Directed by: Tom Tykwer, Andy & Lana WachowskiJumbled conglomeration of The Matrix intertwined with Amistad and Apocalypto that piggybacks on abolition to succeed in driving its message homeI don't even know where to start I will preface this by saying that I am an open-minded, intelligent, empathetic person who generally enjoys films of this genre. That being said, I spent the first half of this movie just trying to separate the plot lines and characters. The incoherent pacing jumped story lines so much, the use of the same actors for each made it all the more confusing. The undesired effect was to distance the audience from the characters to such a degree that you felt little if anything for their plights. The score tries so hard to draw you in and evoke emotion, but I had stopped caring at the halfway mark.The direction and cinematography were great but altogether not that astounding. The make- up and prosthetics were divisive and distracting to say the least. Alas, the Neo/Trinity parody was so obvious, by the time abolition and genocide enters the picture and you're just starting to feel something for the characters, you're too distracted by the blatant use of elements from other successful films. To me, it was nothing more than a collage of other movies, which is clearly more on the screenwriter's and director's side, being that this is based on a book and had every opportunity to hold its own. This film is so complex and convoluted it actually makes The Matrix read like Green Eggs and Ham.Furthermore, there are so many plot elements and dialog that does not make sense. We're supposed to believe the Prussian (Halle Berry) is a higher being, but her accent is Southern?! That was easily the *most* distracting element of the story. By the end, I still didn't understand how each part intertwined to make a whole. This is a classic example of too many hands in the pot, with the multiple writers, directors, production companies— Incoherent and incredibly frustrating.Believe me, I went in wanting to like this movie, especially with some of my favorite actors and minds behind it, but I can't help but find it to be an epic fail. In three, long, excruciating hours, it fails to establish interest or connection with the audience, and in my opinion, if you can't manage these simple elements, none of the rest of the piece matters.5.0 out of 10.0",5,1,6,6 February 2014
Born on the Fourth of July," Insightful, but could've been better
","Born On The Fourth Of July (1989) is more or less the biography of Ron Kovic, a Vietnam vet who eventually becomes anti-war after feeling abandoned and forgotten by the country he fought for.The film moves along well enough, and despite the wonderful portrayal of Kovic by Tom Cruise, I did not find myself entirely drawn into the story. I understood and sympathized what he was going through, but did not feel it, and I can't help but think it's simply the result of an inadequate screenplay. Oliver Stone certainly knows how to direct the material, but I found nothing particularly spectacular. The scene with Ron and Charlie (Willem Dafoe) on the highway was pleasantly amusing. I was however moved by Ron's speech to his mother and later outraged by the abuse he took at the rally, but these moments did not arrive till near the end of the film.VERDICT: Certainly a moving story worth seeing, but I can't help but feel it could've been better. Recommended to all, 17 and up of course.7.0 out of 10.0",7,1,2,12 June 2005
Warm Bodies," A refreshing take on the age-old zombie tale with a bleeding heart at its center
","11/29/2013A refreshing take on the age-old zombie tale with a bleeding heart at its centerPreface: Some of you reviewers are not using your own mind. Complaining about this not being a conventional Zombie tale is like complaining about someone having a better idea than you If this was written just like Dawn of the Dead but with teens, you'd be complaining just the same. Take this film for what it is—a unique interpretation of an old cult classic. And really? Another remake of Romeo and Juliet meets zombies? Did you even READ the play? The ONLY similarity is that their names begin with the same letters. Grow a brain!The film has a provocative introduction with R. jumping right into his view of life as a zombie, and we are pulled not pushed immediately into this post-apocalyptic world. The subtle satire is more than amusing, and his interest in Julie and desire to protect her start us off in a new direction. I personally love the idea of some zombies still being closer to their humanity than being a zombie, and it is ignorant to declare that this is so out of the realm of possibility when we see in our own world today how isolation and alienation can lead to these same undead-like traits in very much living, breathing human beings, who begin committing inhumane acts such as rape and murder, and thus become degenerates of society, rejected and abhorred by all. I personally feel killing someone and eating their brain to provide sustenance to oneself is certainly more HUMANE than rape, torture, and murder, but I digress.Julie continues to try to leave as R. must subsequently protect her, which does not fall into the overused damsel-in-distress motif that other reviewers indicated was so offensive. We are talking about ZOMBIES here, so it would stand to reason that if we're not going with the guns a-blazing, shoot 'em all in the head approach, a zombie would be the only one who could protect her. This is in no way anti-feminist, but believable for the story.R. narrates a bit about zombies and himself, illustrating the ways in which he feels different than the rest, and also serving as a means of clarification to the audience that through the film, not just he, but all the zombies (with the exclusion of 'Bonies') are changing.The story moves along well until the pivotal plot point where R. must do the honest thing and tell Julie that it was he who killed her ex. She utilizes a classic defense mechanism, stating she had been mentally preparing for such an event, however disappears the following morning to return to her father. Meanwhile, R. finds his zombie friends were run off by the 'Bonies' who wish to quell this newfound hope beginning to run rampant amongst their zombie counterparts who are meant to become them. This is all quite believable until this point, as we are to believe that the 'Bonies' became just that because they lost hope and therefore do not think, however it is just that that the story leads into.I do find it quite surprising that John Malkovich comes off very two-dimensional and lacking the charisma and wit we are used to seeing from him, however one could leave this to bad writing and/or direction. I did find the pace to retain my interest and was fascinated more by R. than any other character.Overall, the film is quite entertaining with a refreshingly original look at a tried-and-true plot line. Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer excelled in their respective parts where the others just kind of faded into the background. I really would've liked to have seen more from Dave Franco, as I think he is fresh, up-and-coming talent. Good storytelling with some minor plot holes, and respectable direction that holds the audience's interest throughout. I for one appreciate the author as well as the screenwriter's intention on making a film that steps outside of the box and asks us to not just think differently, but to explore a psychological perspective in a situation that would make this otherwise impossible. Kudos to the filmmakers!7.0 out of 10.0-H. Martin",7,1,2,29 November 2013
High Fidelity," Entertaining and innovatively comedic, but emotionally shallow
","It's interesting that they present the main character as more or less an asshole, and we might otherwise just write him off, but his complete and utter honesty is his redeeming quality. John Cusack and Jack Black play off each other wonderfully. Rob's (Cusack) quest for self- discovery, starting off by focusing outward and eventually turning inward, is more or less the point and purpose of the film, brilliantly executed with humor in all the right places. But in spite of its honest nature, the film remains undeniably lacking in character and emotional depth.VERDICT: Entertaining as well as a nice change of pace from traditional comedies. Recommended to all, particularly John Cusack fans or anyone on the prowl for an innovative comedy, with the exception that you don't mind narrative films (Rob discusses his most inner thoughts while looking directly into the camera through about half of it).6.0 out of 10.0~AleXa~",6,0,1,14 June 2005
The Island," Intense, stylistic action ride with a weighty, emotional undercurrent
","Reviewed September 5th, 2015 - 4th viewing (Blu-ray 2D-1st)Rich and brilliantly shot, you are immediately captivated by the dystopian premise and artistic set pieces. Questions of science, progress, and ethics enthrall the viewer from the start, and the chemistry between the leads, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) is immediately apparent. You embark on a ride with the two of them, equally enamored with the world they live in and the science behind the fiction. I love films that not only allow us to question the established societal norms, but to convey the importance of thinking for ourselves, never allowing ourselves to trust merely for the sake of it. Even authority figures or educated professionals can be wrong, and we must always look to our own intuition and trust our instincts to drive our own lives.The supporting cast is amazing as well, adding both gravity and levity driving the plot along. My fascination with the potential for automation and medical advances was coupled with the weight of seeing how some of our own basic human rights were deprived, serving to establish a firm attachment to our characters. Scarlett does a superb job transitioning from naïve and helpless to driven and self-reliant, propelled by her trust and faith in her best friend Lincoln, who she comes to realize through the journey they inevitably find themselves on means so much more. I also enjoyed the foresight regarding the fight simulation sequence as to lend more credibility to her character's rapid development. I can't help but think her performance in this film drove Marvel to see her potential as the iconic Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff—I could not be more impressed with her growth.Normally I cringe at the prospect of the same actor playing two different people, but Ewan's performances were so well done you never gave it a second thought. Between the accent and his affection and protective instincts for Jordan, he sold that scene—truly impressive. The locations lent a certain gravitas and believability to the stark differences between their simulated world and the real one. I thoroughly enjoyed the snake scene, as they would of course be like children in regard to danger with animals and scenarios they've never been exposed to—another feat accomplished by their stellar acting.The film poses a number of provocative questions about humanity and ethics, and whether or not something created from your own DNA could be classified as property. This is an interesting topic as currently, the law views pets (living creatures) as property, and as such, for example in the event of an untimely death, the owner is only entitled for the purchase price of their beloved pet. At any rate, I find the entire premise an interesting lesson in ethics as we are currently standing on the precipice of progress in that this 'science fiction' could be on the verge of reality as we speak. As far as the argument that this would never be allowed to come to pass given government regulation, these people do not understand that money drives the world, and for the salary these people are given and the fact that they work in an old military bunker deep underground, there is little motivation or opportunity to speak out if they want to live.While some of the action sequences are improbable, they are so spectacularly done, it is hard to care. Sure, the truck driver would've pulled over after the first metal dumbbell fell onto an oncoming car, and the highly trained mercenaries probably wouldn't have shot the sign down, but in reality, people do dumb things, so I'm not sure how much weight that argument carries. And I personally found the mercenary Albert's change of heart as he came to know the truth behind the job was another superb representation of choosing humanity above all else, which was in essence the theme of the film. The decision was completely in character based on what his family suffered, and I did not find this predictable in the least.Other than the intense action scenes, you could hardly tell this was a Michael Bay film—it was so rich and stylized and genuine. Sure, it still contained his trademark explosions and pizazz, but it held a powerful message locked inside a beating heart, and I truly was left feeling satisfied in a way I cannot quite explain. It fires on all cylinders, providing something for all caches, both realized and unrealized: the intelligent thinker, the brooding romantic, the skeptical believer, and the adrenaline junkie. It is his best work by far, and I can only hope this will not be the last of its kind. I'm not sure why others choose to fault Bay for his directorial style and wide-sweeping low angle shots when they serve to convey the emotion behind the sequence. The man is great at what he does, so give credit where credit is due. By the end of the film, I felt as though I had lived through the events with them, and that is nothing short of a marvelous accomplishment in my book. My only real complaint would be product placement, but few action movies are devoid of it, so it hardly seems a noteworthy point.I was so incredibly stupefied and sated, I was ready to watch it again the very next day, seeking out the thrill ride and emotional weight that left me feeling so elated by the end. That very rarely happens to me with the volume of films I watch and am amazed I have not given it more viewings to date. I cannot recommend this film enough! FINAL VERDICT: A mind-blowing thrill ride sitting atop a large-scale, stylistic set piece supported by some of the very best acting talent with an intelligence and emotional depth that few films achieve, this movie WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.9.0 of 10.0",9,0,0,5 September 2015
