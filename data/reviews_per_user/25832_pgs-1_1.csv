Vertigo," Genius
","I could write of VERRTIGO forever, but many thing has already been said and for the (hopefully few) who dont have seen this grandiose picture, it would be shame to revealed to much. But... I can say that the film is Stewarts way to the death, you can see this from the beginning. There are no way he ever could have been saved. I can say that Stewart (as in REAR WINDOW) looks like a surrogate for Hitchcock. And that is seems to be Hitchcocks most personal film. Actually it seems to be the reality of that time, where Hitchcock desperatly looked for a new Grace Kelly, and drive his actresses to madness with his obsession. Therefore it was naturally that Vera Miles should have played Madeleine/Judy. She was in a another place, as Tippi Hedren later should be, now it was the most a-normal Hitchcock heroine one can imagine, Kim Nowak, who played the part. It seems to be perfect that a 'wrong' girl has the part. And that she was never a good a actor is not a problem. Yet it had been intresting to see, how Miles would have been in the role, perhaps it was to close the the real world. VERTIGO is a amzing masterpiece (rank it at number 28, as IMDB, is totally crazy) My favoritte film of all time is Rear Window, which is easier tÃ³ love, than this haunted film. VERTIGO remains the possible most genius film ever.P.S. Hermanns score is fabolousP.P.S It never manage Hitchcock to find a new Grace Kelly, and after it failed to give Grace Kelly a comeback with MARNIE, Hitchcocks creative gens retired.",10,3,5,11 October 2002
