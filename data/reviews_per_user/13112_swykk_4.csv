Requiem for a Dream," familiar elements presented in an original manner
","as far as movies that make a point go, this one makes several important ones.  i am not going to concentrate so much on the cast because all you need to know about them is that they were perfect for their roles.  the standout is ellen burstyn, who at times had me wondering how she prepared for this part.  christopher mcdonald has a dark comedian role of sorts ala john ritter in gregg araki's brilliant teen drama/dark comedy nowhere. this is where reqiuem confuses me.  take the films drugstore cowboy and trainspotting then cross them with a bit more deadpan desperation and you have requiem for a dream.  normally i would say that in a bad way, claiming it as unoriginal but in this case there's a huge exception.  aronofsky simply made a powerful film with a spectacular score by pop will eat itself's clint mansell.  make no mistake folks, reqiuem will grab you harder than trainspotting did (although in retrospect i like trainspotting more), it will make you more depressed than american beauty, and it will leave you wondering why there was no sign of life inside this downward spiral that all of characters were on.  once reqiuem starts falling, it falls very fast.rating- warning- this film will change your mood for the worse even if you like it.  get the DVD if you can because of the excellent special features. other than that, i'd give it 8 out of 10 overall.",Null,0,0,7 June 2001
Fight Club," tyler durden-poster boy for anarchy
","brad pitt is a different kind of actor.  he has made good choices (seven, snatch) and really really bad ones (meet joe black, interview with the vampire) but fight club was definitely his best choice of all.  his, helena bonham carter's and ed norton's performance were not comparable to anything else i've ever seen.  it was all just dead-on and too real.everything about this film appealed to me.  the things i read about the plot.  let's face it this world sucks and some of us are not wanted.  yep, i get it.  i went on to read that david fincher would be directing and seven was awesome.  so again, check.  then i read the book and loved it.  so one more time, check.  when i finally saw the movie, it was complete.  i couldn't have been happier with the results and i was glad to see that screenplay writer jim uhls stuck to the book for the most part.  author chuck palahniuk is the absolute god of satire and i recommend all of his other books for you to read, before they become hit films as well.  just so you know, survivor is in the works and i don't mean that lame australian outback crap.  so check out not only fight club the movie, but all of palahniuk's stories.rating- explosive, anarchy, humor, meat loaf, jared leto (the girls like him i hear), etc...what else do you need?  10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,19 June 2001
The Shining," alcohol or the paranormal?
","this is the scariest movie i have ever seen.  i still live in fear of those twins.  my friends have an apartment with hallways like those found in the overlook hotel and i am always on the lookout for little boys riding big wheels and/or little girls telling me to play with them forever.  anyway, i love the way the late and great kubrick directed this even though i hear all the time that it doesn't follow the book.  the best thing about the shining is the psychological war that is waged upon both jack and you, the watcher. is all this stuff happening or is it all just 'cabin fever?'  check this one out for sure for its suspense, horror, and the comedy spots in between.",Null,0,0,8 October 2000
Trainspotting," heroin and friends
","this movie takes an odd look at life, more specifically, an odd look at heroin.  the dirty, desperate, colorless depiction of addicts is clear and present but the all around feel is more surreal-like you are really seeing the world as heroin users do (i wouldn't know it's just a guess).  for all its seriousness, there are several hilarious comedy spots.  so when trainspotting brings you down, it picks you back up again...something i have to say i enjoy more than a raw feel (requiem for a dream).  strong performances all around by mcgregor and carlyle as well as macdonald, bremner, mckidd and miller.  what a twisted group of friends these guys are, let me tell you.  keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer, right?  that goes for heroin and this group of would be con men/thugs/friends.  excellent dialogue and a sweet club scene were also a plus.rating- you can choose life, i'll choose trainspotting. 9 out of 10",Null,0,0,14 June 2001
