The Equalizer," A well performed solid action drama, better than reviews have suggested.
","Robert McCall (Washington) works at Home Depot during the day where he encourages his fellow colleagues to achieve and be more, at night he sits and reads in a 24 hour dinner and does the same to a local escort who eats there. After a slow burning start its not long before this widower turns into a one man army taking down the Russian Mob and corrupt Policeman alike. Se entirely among the working class population of Boston its set among an urban America not populated by any middle class characters and is all the better for it. Based on all original Television series starring the late Edward Woodward which always felt a bit cheesy here director Fuqua takes a more gritty and real approach. McCall at the start is just a nobody, but pretty soon its obvious he is a man with a past which is never entirely revealed to us. The Russian mob, led by the dark and scary Teddy (An excellent Martin Csokas) are determined to stop him. You know from the beginning that the film will end with a climax involving the aisles and lots of power tools but that's okay. The film is well paced, well directed and has an edginess that's just on the right side of believable and well away from the wrong side of the likes of Taken 2. All the cast do well and there's a very small cameo from Bill Pullman at one stage where more is hinted at about McCalls past, but this is Washington's film all the way giving a brooding performance as he dispatches bad guys between breakfast and dinner while taking the moral high ground. Its a good modern imagining of the original series, nothing more, nothing less. An undemanding, well made, thriller that will past the time quite pleasantly.",8,1,5,29 December 2014
Iron Man 3," Proof that not all thirds to a trilogy are bad - Great script and dialogue, that's why!!
","I am not normally a fan of sequels, let alone the third one, unless of part of a continual story (ie Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings) so I approached Iron Man 3 with a much apprehension. There had been a deluge of Superhero films recently it seemed and I wasn't sure I really want to see another one. Yes the Avengers had been fun and I had enjoyed the first Iron Man, but not seen the second one which I had been told was disappointing.I have said it before, every great movie starts as a great script, and here we have one. Tony Stark's one liners and put downs even in the company of a small boy are priceless and restrain the film from slipping into melodrama that we don't need. The plot here is pretty simple, the world is under threat from a villain and Stark / Ironman is going to stop him. There is an important message here, that not every terrorist is what he always seems. Robert Downey junior who seems unstoppable at the moment, is on top form again as the playboy genius and all the supporting cast are great as well with a star in pretty much every supporting role. Guy Pearce does a great turn as a disgruntled Scientist. I found the film very enjoyable, well paced and well directed by Shane Black, who I remember from the original Predator movie, and if memory serves me right he made his name in Hollywood by writing The Last Boy scout. It seems he was ready for the Directors Chair and does a great job with what I hope is the last Iron Man film for now. The film brings things nicely to full circle, yes, by all means let him appear in more Avengers films, but I think, and I am sure Downey would agree, that this is a more than satisfactory end to the story of Iron Man. Thoroughly entertaining!",8,1,8,1 May 2013
Fury," 'History is violent' - You will feel like you have lived in a tank after this movie...
","Its April 1945, the war is almost over in Europe and the Allies are pushing into Germany. No one wants to die in the last few weeks of the war and such is the challenge facing the crew of the Sherman Firefly 'Fury' - When their assistant driver is killed, newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman, an actor clearly with a long career ahead of him) is assigned to a tank crew in what almost seems like a clerical error. His crew are veterans since Africa and unsympathetic to his nerves and fears. As the unit pushes into Germany to relieve various stranded units and capture a town he is forced into a baptism of fire he will not easily forget. I went to see this film with my wife (Who hates war movies normally and I kind of tricked her into going) and a make up artist friend of mine and all three of us enjoyed it for different reasons. So hats off to the Director because my wife rarely enjoys a war movie, but she felt the film was good because it concentrated on the intimate relationship between the five men that is formed in such a small space and that is the focus of the movie. It has many similarities to the movie 'Lebanon' (A film set inside and told entirely from the perspective of a crew of a tank in the Middle East) in many respects - and although this film isn't quite totally tank interior POV as that one was it captures the grime, the sweat and the oil of the confined space perfectly. Writer / Director David Ayer has managed to present us with a environment that we have rarely seen before in a World War 2 movie. Despite the very English countryside being a bit of a giveaway to some of the location shooting, the Production Design here is top notch and for those into their history there is much to enjoy, not least of which is that this is the only movie in history to feature an original working Tiger tank, care of Bovington tank Museum. The acting by the five leads is solid with Jon Berthanl being especially unpleasant as the tanks gunner. Say what you like about Shia LeBeouf being an oddball, but he clearly can act and that is all I care about when I go to see him on the screen, Micheal Pena and Brad Pitt come over as the Mother and the Father of the group, with Pitt's pragmatic Commander teaching some lessons to their latest recruit with brutal reality. He doesn't want his men to die, and therein at least lies the one fault in the movie.Given a mission by local Commander (Jason Issacs rolling off his American Army Commander accent with ease) they find themselves alone having to defend a vital crossroads. Aware that the enemy are coming and may charge head long into a company of cooks and clerks down the road we're told they're all that is left to get in the way, but this doesn't really ring true. Its April 1945 and the Allies were superior everywhere and after the Battle of the Bulge Cooks and Clerks were well aware that occasionally they might have to pick up their rifles and could have done so here. But Brad Pitt's Don 'Wardaddy' Collier growls he is going to 'stay' and the rest of his men decide to remain, even though earlier he was very clear he wanted his men to survive the war. This was perhaps the only bit of the film that wasn't entirely convincing, but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie though the battle at the end began to border on the unrealistic after a Germans began missing a tank with Panzerfausts from a range of a few feet. All in all this is a good solid film which is hard to fault. It presents a realistic depiction of war and shows things as they were. One scene where the G.I's capture a town and what can only be described as a consensual rape effectively happens will leave many people feeling uncomfortable but that is the reality of Germany in 1945, women weren't just raped by the Russians, but the Western Allied soldiers too, even if some of them were a little more polite about it. We might not like to talk about it, but it happened - In victory in war men do not always behave like gentleman and even the greenest of recruits can soon become a harden killer. My wife said she enjoyed the movie because she felt as though she had experienced and lived in a tank after seeing it on the big screen (we saw it on an Imax) and yes, while the final confrontation was more for entertainment than for accuracy, this is a film I urge you to see none the less.",8,36,68,23 October 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Gareth Edwards has done it - The prequel story that Star Wars deserved.
","With all the rumours flying about that Disney had interfered with the creative process on this one, just as when Alderaan blew up - I feared the worse. Fortunately my fears were unfounded. Rogue one is as engrossing as it is seamless and while its not perfect it had everything required to make a great movie. I guess everyone has different expectations of Star Wars. The plot which I will only briefly describe involves a group of rebels attempting to secure the plans to the Death Star, the designer of which, having a morale conscience, built the deliberate flaw (The exhaust port which Stewie Darth Vader asked about in Family Guy) so that it could be easily destroyed as long as the information fell into the right hands. This information is contained in an archive and it falls to the daughter of the designer, Jyn Erso, to not only restore her fathers name but get the designs to the rebels who are just itching to get on with events in Episode Four (New Hope) and blow the thing up.So does it hold up? Well, yes, not only does it hold up I would put this film on par with Empire and also Episode IV and this coming from someone who saw the first film on the silver screen in 1977. Gareth Edwards is a director who understands all the combined elements that make a Star Wars Film great. First a good script with the right mix of drama, action, pathos and humour and above all a story that actually makes sense, secondly good well written, rounded, characters that are interesting, diverse and unique, third great visuals - there's so many memorable shots in this film and so many of them are the shots you always wanted to see, fourth well directed action that looks and feels real, that is tense and that you can follow, fifth - tension, this film has it in spades, Sixth nods and references to the original trilogy - they come in abundance, some are comedic, some pure nostalgia while others are entirely appropriate and work so well within the story. Seventh - real sets, please give me a London Underground station redressed over bland CGI sterile sets any day of the week. Here the technology enhances the story and the tension and at no time tries to substitute for either. It is the perfect mix of live action & CG effects. I have not seen them so well combined since Lord of the Rings. This is a man who clearly understands his craft of what makes for a great film. I was highly critical of the prequel movies, which really are a masterclass in how not to make a film, here the total opposite is true. I am not a die hard Star Wars fan in any sense and was fully prepared to be very critical of this film, but find it hard to find fault in it anywhere. The supporting cast were especially good here, everyone from Riz Ahmed to Forest Whitaker giving it their all. The new villain of the piece is brilliantly played by Ben Mendelson (Hard to believe this is the kid from The Big Steal!) Donnie Yen's character was beautifully written, I could have watched another movie just about him alone. The cast feels truly international, as any universe should. Many British actors really make their mark in smaller roles including Duncan Pow & Ben Daniels as Rebel Foot Solider and General Pilot respectively while the likes of Sharon Duncan-Brewster & Jonathon Aris as Rebel Senators argue the merits of the attack in a tense conference debate - gone are the boring council meetings of the prequels. Strong drama is the key ingredient of the day. Here the Rebellion is shown as a far more tangible real faction, not everyone agrees with each other, things get messy and sometimes the wrong people are killed - the film even begs to ask the question, how better really are they than the Empire??? - we know of course, but its great to see such shades rather than just plain good and bad guys.The film contains so many pure Star Wars moments. I have no doubt the Droid (Voiced with skill by Alan Tudky) will become a favourite of many and new aliens and ship designs are not thin on the ground.Chiefly in the acting credits, plaudits must go to Felicity Jones who plays Jyn with real conviction while Diego Luna avoids a Han Solo portrayal of Cassian, her would be ally and sometimes adversary. The appearances of Vader and Tarkin (Incredible) are entirely warranted and in proportion with the rest of the film.One or two of the subplot characters are a little underwritten (perhaps deleted scenes and a longer cut will reveal them to be less so) but that really is nit picking, I had no issue with this at all. To juggle so many major and minor characters in a single narrative in a tight running time, for any director is no mean feat and Edwards manages it extremely well. I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a film about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story - Whatever were his obstacles, he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every Star Wars fan proud. Pure class.",10,880,1445,13 December 2016
Passengers," Beautifully shot, well made, extremely engrossing - surely a contender for Best Production Design?
","Passengers - another film that in my view seems to be getting a bit of an unfair kicking from the press, so I am pleased to see many others like myself agree this is a great film. It certainly deserves to be, stuck as it has been in development hell for several years with different actors and directors coming and going.Its the future (You know, the place you want to live in yourself one day, but sadly ain't going to be around for...) and we're on board the Starship Avalon, a vessel owned by the Homestead Corporation who makes billions of dollars transporting Colonists to new worlds (Don't tell Trump it will give him ideas) around the galaxy and plan do so with the 5000 colonists on board here. The ship is automated and everyone is in hyper sleep including the crew. (A bit like flying on Ryan Air) Everyone will only awaken when the ship is one month out from the destination but unfortunately a large asteroid storm does some damage to the vessel and a pod activates early belonging to young Jim Peston (Pratt, probably his best performance yet) a lowly mechanic who can only access the cheap meals option at the breakfast canteen and has the low budget accommodations (Air BnB) options on board. When Jim realises he has woken 90 years early and cannot wake any other crew who are behind a security sealed door he knows he will die on the ship alone. A year passes before he considers an alternative way of living. His only other company is a bar serving agreeable talking Android called Arthur (Michael Sheen on perfect form as always) In time Jim comes to know the biographies of his fellow passengers and one in particular, a writer not uneasy on the eye, Aurora (Lawrence) gets his attention. Jim learns everything about her from her own diaries and discovers she plans to write a book about her journey to the new world. Jim soon learns he has the ability to wake other passengers up and is faced with a dilemma, wake the girl of his dreams so he is not cosigned to his fate alone or die lonely in space before ever reaching his destination. I guess he could have searched for someone with really good computer skills so he could find the code for that door and wake up the crew, but sadly this thought escapes him or perhaps the new world has no computers?Passengers had me gripped from the word go, from its sleek production design to Pratt's restrained but charming performance there was much to enjoy here. The ship and the dilemma facing Jim seemed all too believable. It felt as though this was the sort of thing one could experience while trying to correct your mobile phone provider and eventually your forced to make a difficult decision. It would not be the first time in history man kind had paid for the choice of cost effectiveness over safety simply because nothing had gone wrong in the past (Like no staff in your cinema screen to tell that bloody girl to get off her mobile phone) but this aside it is the crux of the morale dilemma that faced Jim Preston that really made the film great. I found myself asking how would I deal with the same situation? This is what Passengers asks of you. Jennifer Lawrence is on fine form in the film as well in the role of Aurora and Sheen adds an appropriate level of humour in his role as the dumb waiter of the piece but it is Chris Pratt who really stole the film for me. An actor normally associated with comical quips and nods to camera for Parks and Recreation he really shows his emotional depths and range here.As the characters deal with the additional problems facing them, other dilemmas present themselves and again I found myself asking the same questions as were asked of the characters as the story progressed. This is a sure sign of both clever writing and film making. Another mention must also go to the outstanding production design. Certainly there is some use of CGI here, but the sets and the CGI design of the star ship are simply incredible and blend perfectly together. The Avalon felt like a real ship that must be out there somewhere. Everything seemed so real and the space walk scenes were as dramatically tense as one would expect the real thing to be.I really enjoyed this film and as others have stated it is suitable for those of all ages though the younger children may find it a little wanting due to lack of action but I was rarely if ever bored. Lawrence Fishburne has a nice cameo in the film, but to explain who or how would be to give a spoiler away. I thought this film would benefit too from being seen on the big screen and I was right. The vastness of the empty locations of the ghostly star ship are very much enhanced by the cinema experience. My compliments to the whole team on this production. The price tag for the film seemed a little on the high side but it certainly looks the part and the cast gave it there all (So they should for 50K a minute)Recommended.",7,3,6,4 January 2017
Argo," A well made if somewhat fictional version of real events - but hey this is cinema!
","When the idea for 'Argo' was presented by Affleck and his team, I am sure some Producer somewhere around the table probably said something along the lines of 'Hey wasn't there already a movie made about this subject?' and the reply was probably 'Yeah, but no one will ever remember that version!' I do remember it,(Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper) as a kid, sitting down to watch what I thought was going to be an action picture and as it turned out, was one of my first intelligent and well made feature film experiences as a young viewer, and I remember it vividly, so seeing this much larger budget version brought back pleasant trips down my movie memory lane.Focusing on the true events of the undercover operation to rescue six American staff who escaped the clutches of the Iranian authorities when their Embassy fell in Tehran in 1980, this is essentially a spy thriller with a healthy dose of comedy provided by the Hollywood angle. The plan, devised by CIA fix it man, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is to get them all out disguised as a Canadian film crew for the Sci-Fi blockbuster, Argo which is to be fronted by a Hollywood Producer (Alan Arkin, getting all the best lines) and his FX Cohort, John Chambers (John Goodman) The six staff are under some considerable stress having been couped up for 79 days and tensions rise when the audacity of the plan is revealed to them. The people back home get nervous, the operation is nearly cancelled, but if you've read your history you will know how it all ends.Its hard to find fault in the movie. The production design, tone and colours brilliantly capture the period, the performances are all really solid, Affleck has really matured as an actor, and anchors the film with a perfect pitch understated performance and his direction also hits the mark. Arkin and Goodman make a suitably humorous duo 'If it has horses in it, its a Western!' but the real applause must go to the six actors playing the Embassy escapee's, who created believable characters and tensions with the small amount of well crafted scenes that they are given. Scoot McNairy proving his metal as a name soon to join the top ranks in Hollywood, and Rory Cochrane, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishe and the always consistent Clea Duvall all hold their own nicely in the ensemble scenes where their performances lend gravitas to the realism of the dilemma their real life counterparts were facing. This has 'Nicely packaged for the Oscars' written all over it just a bit too much though, so much so, I could count the nominations as the film rolled along, not that this is a bad thing (I am sure Affleck won't mind) The film does stray a little into the realms of fantasy with dramatic scenes of the bad guys in pursuit where the reality is they were never really that close, and Mendez appears to be white, where he looked more black/Hispanic in real life but of course who ever accused reality of making great cinema? These are understandable changes and a little dramatic license works well to ratch up tension in the final twenty minutes from not a great deal of real drama. Affleck could of perhaps given over the role to someone who actually was the same race as Mendez as there are no shortage of good actors out there, but I guess this project was his baby and as I know all too well, it may well have been his decision to play the pivotal role that got the film the green light in the first place though having George Clooney as a producer probably helped.As Arkin says, if I am going to make a fake movie, then it is going to be a fake hit - So here, this slightly fictional version of the events will almost certainly be a hit with audiences and award ceremonies alike and to be fair to Affleck and the team, it is well deserved. Now, when will we see a good film about the failed rescue attempt?",8,3,6,15 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," All the ingredients were there, but it didn't totally gel - still a film worth seeing though.
","Having heard mixed reports about the film I approached it with a worry that I was going to hate, which I was relieved to say I didn't.I liked the re-boot of the franchise, the casting is good and everyone is slipping nicely into their roles, all be it that some get to do a great deal more than others which is inevitable in a film of this type.The plot as it stands is okay. With the shadow of a war with the Klingons looming, an ex StarFleet Officer, John Harrison (The superb Benedict Cumberbatch) hatches a plot to blow up a Starfleet weapons base and then wipe out many of its key fleet Captains. Losing a friend in the process Kirk begs to stop him and so the hunt is on, but not everything is as it seems.Spoiler Alert.Up until this point, despite a rather silly but fun opening sequence the film works well. Snappy dialogue is abound, everyone looks like their having fun and your quite happy to sit back a go along for the ride. The problem here is Hollywood doesn't know when to stop. Harrison as a villain is way too one dimensional, and once revealed as Khan, he just seems to be played as pure evil, yet he has a totally justified cause in wishing to free his crew. The previous Khan, was a man scorned by Kirk, he wasn't completely evil. I am guessing this is the direction the actor was given but I think he could have been more interesting and this would have made Kirks dilemma less free of moral consequences. My other gripe is that in the time line, technology wise, we seem to be jumping around a bit. I mean the enterprise was only just commissioned last movie wasn't it? Now we have a dreadnought style vessel, just put on screen to look big and powerful, to be honest, it just looks stupid, out of place and makes any battles with it totally devoid of tension, as it seems to fire weapons like alien vessels from independence day, and not like those from a Trek movie. Having gone at such great pains to take us back to the origins and done such a good job of doing so, do we have to immediately go for bigger and bigger ships for our bad guys, and immediately resort to 'Michael Bay' style gunfire in the action sequences, which rapidly makes them very uninteresting to watch. The naval style feel of the space combat is totally loss here and makes it really boring. My ship is bigger than your ship, it can destroy you.... yes it can.... yawn.That aside, I really enjoyed the movie, it was sprinkled with great lines and jokes, the characters felt familiar, but not too familiar but I think it really should be allowed to create its own way now, and not fall back into old links from the show, sure the references should be there, but don't make it a major plot point. I didn't care that Kirk constantly ignores his orders and that the prime directive seems to exist more on paper than anything else, its fantasy after all.The ship is now starting its five year mission, this will get it away from earth and allow for some really interesting ideas for new films. Let's hope we see them.",7,0,1,9 June 2013
Spotlight," An outstanding film that should have been made years ago, tackling the most controversial subject of our time
","When the story broke about the systemic abuse in the Catholic Church between the members of the Clergy and children in their care and the cover up that followed it was world breaking stuff. It rightly shock the church to its core. Social Media made this possible and the cover up impossible to continue, one of the places where this started was the Boston Globe, who started investigating the story with its 'Spotlight' team, a group within the paper that investigate special interest stories. Led by Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton, first rate here as always) his small team take on the task full time only to have it temporarily delayed by the events of 9 / 11. But Robinson and his team are persistent and the more bureaucracy they come up against that seems determined to sweep things under the rug the more persistent they get until the bough breaks and final the cradle falls, leading to law suits world wide through out the church.Cinema was made for films like these, not only is this film damn good, its probably one of the most important films to be made of the last decade and if its overlooked at the Oscars this will be nothing short of criminal. All the cast are first rate here and entirely convincing, from Rachel McAdams as the caring reporter with a heart, to Stanley Tucci's diligent yet suspicious lawyer whose all too aware of how fickle the loyalty of a reporter can be. Jamey Sheridan and Billy Crudup are just the right side of bent but it is Mark Ruffalo in his portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes who take the acting honors here. His impassioned outburst must have resonated with many victims who were brave enough to watch the film when he cries out 'Why not now, what are we waiting for? We have to nail these bastards.' - Never before has a greater crime been committed against such a large number of innocent minors and all in the same of God. Watching the film makes me feel that the Church world wide should pay back every cent to the hell they put those people through. This film is not only demanding and rightly draining, it is vital viewing. Director Tom McCarthy should be proud of himself, because I know I am proud of him and writer Josh Singer, for bringing a project which was blacklisted, with a first rate script and cast to the screen.",10,3,4,29 December 2015
A Bridge Too Far," Probably the last great war epic of its type to be made, and the best of the bunch...
","Now before I am accused of false praise I want to make it clear how I review a film. In my own head the primary purpose of a film is to succeed on its own level, to accomplish its own objective. So does this sweeping film with a plethora of stars in an ensemble piece achieve in telling the fateful story of one of the most daring operations of World War II, and the events in Holland of 1944 - Yes it does, on almost every level.This is not Saving Private Ryan, a story of war told through the eyes of one man and his unit, this is the story of a whole operation seen from the perspective of many different individuals on different sides but it does have the realism and grit of that movie and the grandeur of scale that movies these days can rarely emulate. Only a few other films have been made that can compete with this, the excellent but rather sanitised The Longest Day, and the epic but horribly misrepresented and historically inaccurate Battle Of The Bulge.A Bridge Too Far is basically the story of Allied over confidence gone wrong. The plan was to end the war by Christmas with the intention of capturing a series of bridges with three Airbourne Divisions and one brigade, the last bridge of which sat over the upper Rhine and would give the good guys a back door into Germany. Seemingly defeated, everything looked promising for the operation, but things of course in battle rarely go according to plan.Richard Attenborough packs tremendous detail here into every shot of the film and the special effects still hold up well today. No CGI for the parachute scenes here, they had to drop 800 extras for real on this movie. And the film has several tremendous set pieces to recommend it, from the crossing of the river Waal by the 82nd Airbourne to Grabners SS recon platoon charge over Arnhem bridge against dug in British Paratroopers.Close to three hours in running time the film never the less moves at a cracking pace and is rarely if ever boring. Liv Ulman plays with great care the woman Kate Ter Host, who was instrumental in providing medical care for the besieged British forces at Osterbeek (A woman who deserves a movie about her life, and will get one if I have anything to do with it) and the ensemble cast from Sean Connery, Lawrence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde to Robert Redford all act with appropriate levels of pomp and bravado as is befitting to their various roles. Acting geeks might wish to spot a whole host of talent in supporting and minor roles from Alun Armstrong and Ben Cross along with the excellent Paul Copley, all doing a fine job of filling in those small but crucial scenes. Michael Caine and Edward Fox both do fine jobs as the commanders of the British armoured cavalry leading the way.A Bridge Too Far works because its well written, well acted, well directed and above all it is truthful. Some characters have been amalgamated here and there to consolidate facts and people for time, but there has been no alternation of events. This is a film not to be missed, even if you do not have an interest in military history its unlikely that you won't be moved by the calamity of the events that unravel in this story of why war sucks and how the best intentions of a few people led to the needless deaths of many.This is Attenborough at his finest hour and this film is often criminally overlooked or under stated in biographies and analysis of his work, which as one of the finest epic war films of all time, it should never be. Critics should take note and add it into their lists of one of finest movies of its type ever made. It is unlikely we will ever see its type again, more so the pity.",10,4,6,14 October 2012
We Are Marshall," A story of people healing from tragic events and a very good one at that.
","'We Are, Marshall!' - any film that can make me want to chant a slogan for a school I have never heard of before, connected to a sport I have no real interest in and make me want to buy a jacket for football team that isn't even in my country when I do wear baseball Jackets anymore has to be doing something right.Its 1970 and Marshall Football Team are on a high, they lost a game sure, but they're looking good and the coaching staff, the team and several people from the town and parents of many members are returning home from the game on a private jet when moments from landing disaster strikes. Can the surviving players who were left behind rebuild the team for the 1971 season, can the University find new coaching staff and will the morale of the town ever recover? Such is the true story of the Marshall University Football Team of 1971, as the characters try to pull together, the re-building of the football team comes to illustrate the dilemma everyone is feeling in attempting to rebuild their own lives. We Are Marshall is a simple story but as a well written script where brevity is key its a bit of an unsung masterclass in my opinion. Watch it a second time and you will see in this film every piece of dialogue in every scene serves a moment for either story or character, while not especially original and close to being in danger of 'true story of the week' WRM is much more than that because of the power and sincerity that is evident here in the film making, you can tell everyone wants to be involved and knows their making something that is a bit special, and they'd be right. It's a strong piece of moving writing that is well performed and I would suggest an extremely honourable way of portraying the suffering of a community that was hit by such a large wave of grief in one go that it does not know how to cope. 'How many children lost both parents?' cries a bereaved father. You cannot help but get caught up in the story. The film is entirely not about football, this is a film about grief and how we deal with it, both individually, collectively and to each other. Matthew McConaughey is at his best here as Jack Lenyel the new football coach and pivot for the story as the stranger who comes into town with boundless energy because he just wants to help 'What if it had been my children' - But look around the cast, this is an ensemble piece where many great actors are starting out early on in their careers. Anthony Mackie powerfully plays Nate Ruffin, who missed out on the game because of an injury, his team mate, conflicted Tom (Brian Geraghty showing his great talent early on) wants to help him re build but has survivors guilt because he overslept and should have been on the plane. But the three stand outs for me were Ian McShane as the grieving father who just wants the football programme to die along with his lost son, Kate Mara who is the bereaved girlfriend of that son, and David Strathairn as the University President who is out of his depth trying to please everyone in a situation he never thought he would have to face. All give solid and believable performances. Special mention must also be made of a young Arlen Escarpeta, the scene where he comes back to his empty room with a case of beer is really moving.There are so many good scenes in this film its hard to name them all - We Are Marshall really goes for the heart strings, but it should, its a moving story about a group of conflicted people unsure of which direction to take to move on - Do they embrace the football programme and try and move forward or scrap it and try and leave everything behind? While some time is dedicated to the new team training and the film even manages a few moments of comedy this is above all not a sports movie, sports just happens to be the historical background under which the events take place. Winning seems out of the teams grasp, but is healing? This is the real question the film asks you.Its well worth your time.",9,3,3,22 November 2014
Interstellar," A film I had to digest which for all its grandeur left me feeling unconnected to the characters and their dilemmas.
","It seemed everyone was looking forward to this movie and it reminded me of the hysteria leading up to Prometheus. Not wanting to inflict on myself that kind of disappointment again I choose to read or watch as little about the film as possible, having seen just an early trailer for it. I made sure I saw it on the biggest screen possible, on one of the few 70mm prints in Europe (Of which we were told there were only 4) It was too a packed out house, a good mix of all ages but a very serious looking audience none the less. I had a feeling we were in for an amazing ride so I took my wife to see it not wanting her to miss out on what might be the cinema event of the year. Like the Astronauts in the film I too wanted to know what was out there. The setting, as I am sure you know, is in earths near future, where most of the planet is ravaged by dust storms and the worlds food supply is nearing its end (Pretty similar to where we will be in a few years I am sure) most of the worlds population are farmers, keen to support its diminishing population, but time is running out and in secret the Government (America of course) is looking to the stars for answers and the discovery of a Black Hole may indeed prove our way out. Matthew McConaughey is the man who can, but he's gone back to farming and looking after his son and daughter. He's the best pilot, but if he goes he knows when he comes back his children will be older than he is, if they're still alive at all. So Interstella seems to offer us two dilemma's - the first being what is out there and can it offer us a future? The second being about personal sacrifice for the greater good and how do you know when it is worth it?I wanted more of the first and less of the second, but we seemed to get far too much of the second which was less engaging than the exploration of space and what there was of the first wasn't engaging enough. Every time the movie went back to earth it seemed to slow down, much like time in the movie. The first 45 minutes of the movie feels like the weakest. Some of the dialogue really is quite awful and seems so fake. I like McConaughey as an actor and the cast here are good, but the script really lets them down on some key moments especially early on. Interstella is a visual feast and if I was rating it on that alone it would get a straight 10 out of 10 but emotionally except for one key scene when messages from children long since aged are received by the characters it left me cold much of the time. The appearance of Matt Damon and his characters motivations were actually obvious to me and when they happened seemed more in place with Armageddon and an attempt to introduce drama for sake alone. For all its spectacle on the huge screen this was not a film that grabbed me and pulled me in and I so badly wanted it to. Yes some worlds are explored and its all water and ice, okay probably very scientific but exciting? I am not so sure and the supporting characters began to have the feel of Star Trek security detail and perhaps they should have been wearing red shirts as they all seem so expendable. Wes Bently really stood out for me here, I wanted to see more of him as he is so watchable and interesting on screen without really feeling the need to perform. The robots in the film were great and loved the way they functioned and were a nod to 2001. By the time we were into the last reel my wife had been to sleep three times, so this clearly wasn't her film. I was more engaged, but only just. People have pointed out the plot holes and yes there's many, but its really not those that bother me so much. I am not a Sci-Fi nerd, I am only interested in the world the film maker has created for me and if in its own context I believed that - I did believe it but I just didn't really like it that much - Ultimately maybe love does conquer all but for me, not here. I probably need to see the film again - I am just not sure that I want to.",6,1,2,22 November 2014
Rush," I have no interest in Formula 1, and I loved it.
","Ron Howard has proved himself to be a dependable director of the biography subject matter with other sturdy accomplishments such as the Apollo 13 drama. Here the subject is racing rivalry, not something that would normally having me rushing to the big screen, but that's exactly where 'Rush' should be seen.The topic here is the rivalry between posh boy and self stylised playboy James Hunt, and the more stoic and conservative Nikki Louder. Their competitive nature on the track was something even I vaguely remember, my mother being a James Hunt fan. He was probably a lot of Mums favourites at the time.Why the film works are largely down to two factors, a really well written script which captures the two contrasting characters brilliantly and makes them jump off the page. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Hunt, despite occasionally missing the mark on the accent and no doubt the late Hunt himself would have been very happy with the casting, but its the German actor Daniel Bruhl who carries off the colours here with his portrayal as the determined no nonsense Nikki Lauda with a really perfectly pitched performance.You never entirely sure who too root for here, which could have been the film's failing, but its not, as Howard manages to convey sympathy for both his characters in equal measure for your capacity to dislike them. The approach of the characters towards life varies as much as it does to their attitude on the track, and this is the engine of this film. The icing on the cake is the racing sequences. Well realised and seamless from any special effects that may have contributed, by the end of the film you will be griped.It's an interesting, well acted film on a subject that I don't especially care for normally, but this film made me care enough to watch it and I am very glad I did. See while you still can on the big screen.",9,3,4,22 September 2013
Oblivion," Enjoyable despite some glaring plot holes.
","This was a film I wanted to see on the biggest screen possible, short of the IMAX I opted for the Odeon Leceister Square, the film certainly benefited from being on the big screen. It's the future and man kind has been destroyed by an alien invasion, or so we're told. Th war is over and the humans won, but only at the result of turning the earth into a nuclear wasteland. The invaders, or scabs as they're called, survive in pockets and are still waging a guerrilla war of sorts on earth. In the sky above just in orbit is 'Tech' the control centre which is fuelling what remains of earths resources to the Saturn moon of Titan, this being where the remains of the human population has fled to. The remaining deployment on earth are protected by a fleet of drones, and the drones are maintained by Tech's and their support, who operate from up on high and perform drone repairs as and when needed. These 'efficent' teams are run by couples... one doing the flying/fixing (Tom Cruise) and the other hanging around in the control station / funky floating house - (Not Tom Cruise) but is everything as it seems and why does our hero keep having flashbacks to a former life that took place before he was born? This film looks great, and say what you like about Cruise, but I have always felt he can act and has great screen presence and charisma. The film looks fantastic. Large sweeping landscape of shots of the former United States laid waste into desert look so real and deserts littered with the hulks of ships and nuclear submarines with missile tubes opened are endearing images that will stay with me for some time to come. Where the film dips is when the plot gets going, about 20 minutes in I had a sense of what was coming and the twists as they were thrown at me were not a massive surprise. Morgan Freeman and the excellent Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are underused and barely have more than a few lines of dialogue each. They add weight, but their roles didn't really need to be filled out by stars when this is very much a Cruise vehicle.The ending of the film has been compared to Independence Day and I must confess it was the first thing I thought of when the film went in to its last few minutes. This didn't make it any less enjoyable and the film was a visual feast for the eyes and the acting decent enough all round but this is a story you wouldn't have a hard time poking a few holes in if you try and you wouldn't have to try very hard. Still, this director is making films that deserve to be seen on the big screen.",6,1,5,12 April 2013
Non-Stop," Taken on a plane, but not without its moments.
","Someone on a plane is going to kill someone every 15 minutes unless the Air Marshall (Liam Neeson) is going to stop him. Once again Liam Neeson growls his way through a moody hard man role, plagued with self doubt about his past and a not taking rubbish from his boss, he's going to find the killer whatever it takes. The initial premise for this film is very clever but ultimately the twist fails to deliver and seems a little far from practical within the Universe the film creates. While I can quite easily forgive Liam Neeson taking on another middle aged man dealing with personal issues. These roles are clearly the best way for him to vent his own anger for the awful personal bereavement he himself has experienced, and why not, he plays these roles so well. Less forgiving is the film ultimately failing to deliver on the premise it sets up so well. That said, the film is never boring. The writing cleverly points and re points to the possible killer, even though I was pretty sure I knew who it would turn out to be early on and I wasn't wrong. The supporting actors do a great job too, this is an enjoyable romp, nothing more. Fun but forgettable.",6,1,2,16 March 2014

Guardians of the Galaxy," A fun rocking Sci-Fi experience which rarely lets up the pace.
","I was not familiar with the characters from this aspect of the Marvel Universe so perhaps went and saw the film with less excitement than some. Only the recent Captain America has worked for me of the more recent Marvel efforts, but GOTG really hit the mark.Revolving around a group of down on their luck mercenaries, one of whom was once kidnapped from earth as depicted in the prologue, this disparaging group are thrown together to try and save the universe getting mixed up in all sorts of adventures along the way. Its set in a universe you believe is real, so there is always a sense of jeopardy (unlike in say an Expendables movie) This is a film that you can watch alone from others in the Marvel Universe without having to understand their relevance on impact on the characters depicted here. What you have in this film is strongly written, humorous well acted, character driven action adventure Sci-Fi romp that squarely points out to you from the get go that it doesn't take itself too seriously. The CGI fx work here feels more in place and less overwhelming than more recent efforts, but there is such great attention to detail in every other aspect of the movies Production design as well that there is so much to be savored and enjoyed on screen beyond the top notch cast all of whom are excellent (Including Vin Diesel who as mutant tree creature 'Root' is at his least wooden) Fears that Zoe Salanda playing a green alien would be retreading her recent Avatar role are unfounded as she couldn't be more different but Chris Pratt leads the troop with bags of charisma as Star Lord (Finally!) This is a film about likable anti heroes who don't want to save the day but end up doing it anyway. The supporting cast of stand outs such as John C Reilly, Michael Rooker, Glen Close and many more are all great. It's a film you may want to watch again and almost certainly own. Yes I got the bit at the end, only because I saw that film in the 1980s!",9,1,3,14 August 2014
Frank," I think I need to watch it again - still undecided.
","Any film where one member of the cast wears a mask for all but one scene is going to be a little unusual unless its Star Wars. Frank tells the story of Jon, I want to be music writer who constantly writes lyrics in his head to any given situation. Leading a fairly direction-less life otherwise he accidentally witnesses the attempted suicide of the keyboard player of a travelling band led by papermache head wearing lead singer, Frank, apparently played by Michael Fassbender, (though I cannot help but wonder if a body doubled did all the scenes for him until the end and he did ADR the rest.) Frank never takes off his mask, not even in the shower, the rest of the band take to Jon with varying mixed degree's. He thinks their going to Ireland to do a gig for the weekend, the band has plans to stay in the woods and record music until the find the perfect sound which as it turns out is a very long time. Jon clashes with some of the band, finds understanding in others and has strange and revealing conversations with Frank leading him to wonder if he will ever shed his mask. It is a film about the masks we all can wear at times and does ask something interesting questions about judging people by their actions rather than their looks. Eventually this all spirals to a collision that for some will have far reaching consequences. Frank is a really hard film to label, let alone describe. It's certainly not something you can easily dismiss, even if its not to your taste. There's something very watchable about Domhall Gleeson as the lead Jon, a young man out of his depth, he's likable and too me made the film bearable as most of the time I couldn't really hear Frank's muffled words and the other band members were annoying at best and arbitrary to the story for the most part. the film is Jon's Journey and how he grows around people who think their more talented than perhaps they really are. As a story about the torture and eccentricity being genius this is a film that works well except for the fact that the band don't seem that talented to begin with. Just as things really get bogged down the action shifts to America and there is a little change of tone. As a dark comedy the film is not without its laughs and somber moments following in quick succession but overall its a hard film to recommend to people as it feels akin to Marmite, you're probably either love it or hate it. I think I will probably need to watch it again to decide.When Fassbender is definitively on screen his performance is moving and believable as always and the film is beautifully shot by James Mather so there is much to admire in the film along with the fact that it is at least original. I have read since the character of Frank has been partially inspired by an actual singer, but to me that's not really relevant as this is clearly a fictional story. Those with experience of the extreme persona's of the music world will probably relate more to the characters and their dilemmas than those that do not, but this isn't a film about the music industry, that is simply the backdrop for a narrative that is a statement about people and the way we see and interact with each other. On this level the film offers some interesting insights. While I am not sure if that has enough momentum to charge a movie, its certainly a commendable effort.",6,1,2,20 October 2014
Sicario," So far for me, the film of the year!
","There are some films you just watch from beginning to end, completely enthralled when in the cinema, glued to your seat by a mixture of powerful performances, a gripping story and stand out photography. Sicario is one of those films. I saw this with my partner and they agreed wholeheartedly, this was a stand out movie from start to finish and will be making its way to my Blu-Ray collection as soon as available. Emily Blunt gives a solid performance as the lead, here she plays an idealistic FBI agent who wants to make a difference and is given the chance to do so against the Mexican drug cartels and their hit men, but just how far are you prepared to bend the law before you break it and become like them? While I cannot claim to be an expect on the Mexican Cartel drug trade or the complexities which must surround American attempts to police and control it I felt like we got pretty close to the truth with it here. No one is quite who they seem and every character has their own agenda to the end. One of the nice things about the film is the minimum use of dialogue. The actors really have room to breathe here in their performances and are well complimented by the haunting photography of Roger Deakins who does a visceral job of bringing the landscape of this world to life, with its brutal soaring heat combined with the darker and more shady tones. There's no weak links in the cast here, the stand out performance is Benicio Del Torro who conveys amazing menace with his character 'This is the land of wolves now'. Josh Brolin proves that his career has now soared above and beyond his own fathers with another assured performance as the Government Agent who is quite happy to use whatever tools he has to in order to achieve his objectives. While one might find plot holes if you really look I found this drama swept me completely away and was totally engaging. It is the kind of film I love to see on the big screen and gladly pay my money to the studios for. More like this please. A credit to everyone who worked on the film. Superb film making.",10,2,6,31 October 2015
12 Years a Slave," A film that troubles me greatly for all the wrong reasons....
","There is much to like about McQueens film, an amazingly talented film maker if ever there was one. Some people hated 'Shame', I thought it was amazingly brave and so relevant to the world today. The story of 12 Years a Slave is well known so I won't regurgitate it here or debate the veracity of the truth of the details. I am sure the story is true and almost certainly even worse than we got to see on screen.The performances are all first rate with the plaudits going to newcomer Lupita Nyong'o who plays another fellow slave in a truly awful position of the subject of desire and torment which she must endure almost daily. Chiwetel Ejiofor anchors the whole piece nicely and Michael Fassbender and Sarah Poulson epitomise total evil as the last white slavers that host our protagonists life. The camera-work is beautiful and haunting at the same time, lingering as it often does on nature and light to set the tone and mood. The films display of brutality that slaves went through in the American South is relentless. This is 'Roots', with all the gore and its totally uncompromising in its delivery. I've heard the critical view that the whites here are too one dimensional. Some are kind slavers, but still slavers none the less, while others are just the worst people alive with Brad Pitts cameo being the only decent person among them. I can't argue with this depiction as unfair, because I am sure its not, the focus is after all on the Cotton Farms which were not a nice place to live and grow up. The film ticks all the boxes and will win lots of awards and I am sure will get rave after rave review. I am something of an connoisseur of the true story drama, I must have over 200 in my DVD collection. I think they're the heart and soul of what makes great cinema, real stories about real people that should tackle real issues and give a real response of emotion form the audience. It is what make films such as these rank as master pieces alongside Star Wars and The Godfather. It should rank as one of my favourites in this genre, up there with Schindlers List, The Murder Of Stephen Lawrence, Wall Of Silence, Hillsborough and so on. So why didn't I like this film? Films such as these are not films you can always enjoy watching, their an experience to digest, sometimes not easily and that's fine I can still digest such a film and say its a good film, and it is, its an outstanding piece of cinema in many respects and its the job of the film maker to challenge, educate, shock and teach us. This film does all of these things. Now I personally didn't learn too much that was new about the American south as I am well educated and while I wasn't familiar with Northup's personal story I was fully aware of what went on and have digested a great deal of other work on this subject. Though I don't live in America I have been there many times and I am acutely aware of the great racial divide that still exists between the communities over there and its primarily because of this great history of slave culture that they have that such division which was never as strong in the UK. While I applaud any film that tackles such a tough subject and seeks to expose it for all it was, I found here that this film felt a little too late. When Mississippi Burning was released in the late 1980's its release was marred by a number of outbursts of violence in cinemas across America. These were caused by reactions to the film, by the reality of the racism in the south of the 60s being exposed for the younger 80s generation, and so this film does the same on a topic that has been covered extensively before but rarely with such gore and brutality. It felt at times to me I was almost watching horror porn but in different genre and while one can rightly say this is realistic and we should see it, I fear for the divide that this will continue to cause among the communities in the USA. A recent visit there has only confirmed for me how little has changed and how little the black and white communities, on the East Coast especially interact with each other and how racial tensions run higher than ever before. I feel certain this film will do nothing but add to those tensions and that is what truly disturbs me more than the film itself. I see no hope offered in the film to bridge our communities and our races in a film of this type and while the film is an amazing work I think the wider implications of it should be considered. There is this great personal story sure, and on that level its an amazing and draining experience but in a wider a context I fear for the reaction it might cause and the attitudes it will only seek to exacerbate. I wish this film had been made at the same time as Cry Freedom, when I feel it was the time to ram these messages home but now it feels like its rammed down my throat and at the wrong time when the world really does need to unite as a people and not divide. This will be a controversial view I know, yes Slavery was bloody awful, people associated with it were evil, I think we all know this already, but just in case you don't here is a film that will really upset about the subject. After viewing it, where will you direct that anger? See it and decide for yourself.",6,0,1,17 January 2014
Prometheus," Commendable failure, but still a failure.
","Regarding this film, I was a huge fan of the first two Alien movies, and a big fan of Scott in general, met him and he was a very nice man. So it was with great excitement that I got to take my fiancée to see this in the opening week at the Imax. Despite all the debates about the film, all that matters is what I see on the screen the first time I go, and then the only thing that really matters is 'Is it any good...?' My answer isn't a simple yes and no unfortunately. Its certainly would be silly to dismiss it as crap, but I can't chant its praises either, even though I really want to, and as I said before I met Ridley and he was a very nice man and I am a big fan. IT IS A FILM YOU SHOULD SEE ON A BIG SCREEN, THE BIGGER THE BETTER, of that, there is no doubt.I need to prefix my comments here with the following - Ultimately, I don't care if its part prequel, all prequel or isn't a prequel and someone is pretending that its not a prequel all I care about is 'DOES IT MAKE A GOOD FILM IN ITS OWN RIGHT' ??? Does it work on its own? Because it certainly should. It has a great premises, a good cast, and it looks lovely, so why doesn't it work? Now when I first left the screen I was in a good mood, but part of me felt really empty, then as time went past I realised more and more of the film didn't make sense, contradicted the boundaries of the films own reality (Don't you hate it when they do that? See the last Brosnan Bond for an explanation) and there seemed to be huge chunks missing. Okay, great there might be a directors cut to come, awesome, look forward to that. But that should add depth to whats already there, not compensate for holes that already exist, and this film had holes a plenty.The good points were as always Scotts use of the Camera, the shots, the visuals, effects, casting, (Some of the acting) but the bad were plenty too.The script has some dire, truly dire, lines. Characters that are established as scared when there is nothing to be scared of act completely unafraid when an obviously snake like monster is about to eat them. The Captain of the ship seems either woefully underwritten or under developed. Idris, I love you normally, but what was going on here? We establish a Captain who does seem to care about and have a loyal crew, then a serious incident occurs which kills at least 5 of them, which passes without so much as a comment or emotional reaction (Cut, perhaps? shoot the editor then) making the rest of his performance therefore totally unbelievable. Naomi Repace is good enough but again her character is so one dimensional, the scene where she removes the foetus, while shocking is made totally laughable by the scenes that immediately follow it, I know this is Science Fiction, but come on, you might as well have an Alien put on a Hawaiian hat then and dance with the android. Repace seemed to be trying an American accent in some scenes and totally repressing her own, then in other scenes, there was her Scandanavian in every word.The opening 15 minutes gave me loads of confidence that this was really going to be something but it was ruined by a number of convoluted subplots involving Waylan and his dream of an ever lasting life, which though perhaps realistic within the setting is an overused idea that has been seen so many times before - why not focus purely on the dilemmas of the crew of the ship, there were 17 of them after all, many of whom were reduced to no name roles in the credit list (Ship Techician 1 and so on) I can actually remember the names of every single marine in Aliens, even the ones who did not speak, such was the power of the picture, and that was after a single viewing. (Names like Spunkmeyer do tend to stick in the head, but I digress) Other really iffy moments are when two crew are reporting in that they have found Alien life (You know, a fairly big deal!) at this moment the Captain is elsewhere, then when he comes back on the bridge later, he says nothing of the report the men mentioned, trust me, this isn't a plot thing. Everyone can see the crews camera footage, its already been established earlier, so why isn't this mentioned by anyone? Did they forget to hit rewind or something? Characters do really really stupid things, sure like real life, but this is a movie, and it has to work in context presented, and a lot of it didn't. Fassbender was the best thing in the film, but his limitations as an Android seemed to be contradictory at best and by the end really confusing. He laughs at his own jokes, yet is apparently devoid of real feelings. Okay maybe he is trying to learn, like Data from Star Trek or something, who knows because it wasn't explored. I think Fassbender is actually the best British male actor around today and he was brilliant but could not alone save the movie.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate or even dislike this movie, but I find it a little mystifying that someone of the calibre of Scott should make such glaring errors in his film. I am seriously hoping that an extended cut will at least rectify some of the glaring character defects that we seemed to endlessly witness but feel doubtful that it can turn what is a very commendable but ultimately flawed film, into a great one.",3,2,4,4 November 2012
Taken 2," A poorly made sequel with only the dollar sign firmly in mind
","Now look, I am going to say from the start, I like Liam Neeson, a good solid actor, even if lately his roles seem to be that of the brooding loner, perhaps very understandable considering recent personal circumstances and its a role he plays very well, so no problem with that. I loved the original movie, I saw it at the cinema, rented it, own the DVD and have shown it to many people. Its a great film, slick, fast, sets up its own universe rules as just the more realistic side of a James Bond movie, and it doesn't break those rules or lapse into total absurdity. Sure Neeson does impossible things but we get that and go along for the ride.Here though, something went seriously wrong. The action relocated to Istanbul could have been potentially very interesting and the basic story, as shown in the trailers, so no spoilers here, is that the family of the men he killed in the first film want their revenge. I like this idea, that those seemingly meaningless extras whose job it was to basically die in the first film, actually have friends and relatives who care about them and want to see Neeson dead. In the world that Taken has set up, this is all very plausible and I am sure seemed a great idea on paper. So what happened? The script then becomes riddled with ideas that are beyond dumb, and Istanbul is reduced to a minor backdrop and not used to its most effective use and as can be seen from other reviews, Turkish people found the film and its depiction a little offensive, I am not surprised. Most of the film could have been set almost anywhere except for a couple of wide shots. Characters do and say things that make no logical sense at all and the rules of the Taken universe are constantly broken. Yes we can suspend our disbelief to a point, but the film reaches a level of absurdity where your just squealing in your seat that this really is awful. Some of the acting from the supporting cast isn't great either but maybe that's down to the very poor tools (Script) they were given to work with. The action scenes are dumb and seem devoid of the tension and abrupt impulse that came with the first movie. Such a shame, because with a good script I would be quite happy to watch this character in any number of scrapes and I do enjoy a well written and well directed action flick with a good story, unfortunately this had none of those elements. If you have to watch it, wait for the DVD, even if there is an extended cut, I fail to see how it will resolve any of the issues here. Wake up Hollywood, we really aren't this dumb. So many Producers on one movie - ever heard of 'Too many cooks?'",3,24,36,14 October 2012
Straight Outta Compton," An incredible film that is about so much more than just NWA and succeeds on all levels
","Brought up in the UK in place about as far removed from Compton as The Moon NWA was a band that I could get into but not really fully appreciate the emotion and the anger behind the lyrics - that was until 'Boys in the Hood' came out. That movie brought a reality to foreign shores that gave us an insight into the birth place of this music. Now Straight Outta Compton gives you the story behind that music. I'll say out and out this is a MUST SEE SUPERB FILM which for me will rank as one of the most important films of all time. It probably wouldn't do the Police of the USA any harm if they sat and watched it then they actually might have a grasp of how they make people feel and in the light of the wave of Police brutality in America never has such a film been more relevant. The film itself charts the rise and fall of the group from their humble beginnings of sleeping out of cars and recording tracks in friends garages through to their internal beefs, eventual break up and the paths leading to the potential reunion that was cut short by the death of Eric Wright from HIV. So why is it so good? Well first off the performances of all the cast without exception incredibly well pitched. O'Shea Jackson as Ice Cube shows he can already hold his own against his father in his very first acting role while Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell play Dr.Dre and Easy E with a great deal of poise and sensitivity portraying them as flawed human beings and relating for me the films main theme - Division will always conqueror. Paul Giamatti brings a well rounded performance as the groups manager making it hard for you not to totally dislike him and so it should be. But its not just the acting - While telling the story of one of the most influential Rap groups of all time the film manages to make two very powerful statements - 1) The fact that the issues the film raises about how a Police Force treats its citizens are even more relevant now than they were then. Rodney King was beaten some years after NWA was formed and what happened to him only reinforced the anger that NWA was articulating in their lyrics. A topic which middle class white America choose not to believe until they saw that video. Now this film serves the same purpose - It underscores what is happening in America now and the need more than ever for it to be addressed. The film may not have intended this but it achieves it 110% 2) The internal conflicts in the black music industry are highlighted so successfully that it makes you realise how much such feuds only serve the cause of those who want to keep people in their place. The futility of being so divided all the time which ultimately comes from greed or in the cases of some an additional sadistic mentality. (Surge Knight) The divisions here broke friendships some of which could never be completely repaired. The death of Eric Wright was something that didn't get as much press in the UK as it did in the states and I was probably only more aware of it at the time because of my interest in NWA and having lost my own cousin to HIV a few years earlier. The film underlines the need within the black music community for artists to be more mutually supportive of each others work regardless of which coast their from and what neighbourhood they were born in. This film should be successful for all the right reasons and while it might not be 100% accurate for it to contain so much power in a film of two hours twenty minutes is nothing short of superb. It will of course be criminally overlooked at the Oscars I am sure. The film will serve as the perfect companion to Filmmaker Dylan Avery's documentary about Police corruption when it is released. I have no doubt what so ever that Eric Wright would be incredibly proud of all involved. This is the film that not only NWA deserve but all the people who ever grew up in Compton too.",10,17,53,9 September 2015
Midway," A commendable effort but needs a longer directors cut - RELEASE IT PLEASE
","Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.What MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.Before I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.That said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.Credit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)Director Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level.",8,82,134,8 November 2019
Alien: Covenant," I can only echo the sentiments of others
","Great visuals do not for a great film make - Never is this truer than in this film.I could do a detailed break down of everything that is wrong with this god awful film, but everyone has already said everything that needs saying.What a shame that this will probably mean the death of Neil Bloomkamps Alien project, which I am sure would have we'd all over this nonsensical mess. This is just simply no excuse for such a god awful piece of film making as this total turd. I normally try and be as constructive as possible, but when you have this much money and control over your product, this is simply no excuse. I certainly hope this is not Scott's last film. Just truly awful.",1,2,3,3 August 2017
