Requiem for a Dream," Masterpiece Film Work
","Requiem for a Dream is not your usual 'drug' movie, in fact I wouldn't call this one of those anti - drug movies, this movie is about the four characters harbored around their addictions, not allowing themselves to live a full life. The director gets the best performances from everyone in the film, especially from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn. This film is an experience you forget you are watching a movie because the characters in the film portray the worst possible paths of life. A lot of people who have seen this movie can't get by the 'depressing' feeling they feel after watching but if you look through that this is a masterpiece relating simple emotions(love, friendship, parenthood, and person freedom) and turns them to hell. The soundtrack to this movie is amazing conveying all of the pain and love from the film.One of my favorite newer movies.",10,1,2,20 August 2004
Se7en," One of the Best Serial Killer Movies
","Seven, director David Fincher's best film has everything a thriller of this sort needs, good direction, good acting, suspense, deeply disturbing images, and a good killer. This film was before Kiss the Girls, Copycat, Along Came a Spider and Taking Lives, and each of these films have taken from Seven. The film has a dark mood(it's always raining) and a very gritty look to everything. The acting is perfect, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are a great team of cops and Kevin Spacey puts in a very good job. One thing I thought was genius was using the Nine Inch Nails song for the titles sequence. This with Fight Club are David Fincher's masterpieces.Made over $100 Million at box office.",10,0,0,20 August 2004
Halloween," Classic That Started It All
","Halloween is a very important film, not only jump starting unknown director John Carpenter's and unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis' careers but also started the 'slasher' flick craze throughout the eighties and even now. I think this is Carpenter's best, before he started putting his name before all his film titles, he uses many good camera techniques and actually makes the character of Michael Meyers someone to be afraid of. Despite its very low budget it still holds up today, despite the acting isn't the best(except for Donald Pleasance) and everything has sort of the 70's feel. Made $50 million at the box office.Very Impressive. Spawned eight or so sequels.",8,0,1,20 August 2004
