Hereditary," Dumb, dumb, dumb.
","*spoilers*
A score of 87 from the critics? Will never again rent or buy a movie based on critic reviews. What a shame because Toni Collett is such a great actress. Actually, if the writer could have dug deep and made this a movie about loss of a child in a repressed family, it might have been good. But this schlock horror Rosemary's Baby rip-off at the end was just way silly - and the added gore and special effects did not help. What a dreary, unpleasant waste of time. Are critics getting dumber? The opening shot was cool, if only I had stopped there.",1,0,1,8 September 2018
Us," What the heck was it?
","So it's too nonsensical (like where did the underground people get their clothes - from underground sweat shops in China?) to be a science fiction. Must be a horror movie, but with the out of place, lame, tongue in cheek attempts at humor, it's really not scary. I know, it's a social commentary and the underground people are symbolic of the downtrodden and ... nope, not that. Wait, it's an allegory for self-exploration - nope. All a dream? None of those, and the twist at the end can be seen a mile away - but don't care enough about the superficially rendered characters to care about the twist.I got it: It's a cynical attempt to make money off the success of 'Get Out'.",2,2,2,25 November 2019
Us," Just playing at social commentary
","Too nonsensical to be a science fiction (did underground people get clothes from underground factories? No, I get it's an allegory), too full of lame jokes to be horror, characters too superficial to be cared about.A movie, or story, so heavily symbolic really isn't saying much of anything beyond the obvious. Yes, there are people who are less fortunate than other people. This movie is just a game or puzzle for the viewer to try and figure out what symbolized what. But movie provides no insight and evokes no emotion about what it pretends to address.Compare this silly, intellectualized, exercise of self-indulgent 'social commentary' to a movie like 'Grapes of Wrath'. See what I mean?",2,2,3,27 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," More collectible figurines.
","See, Finn had that psychic 'feeling' in battle because his great uncle is a second cousin to Darth Vader's brother.Well, the special effects were pretty good, but couldn't really tell if on a giant spaceship, in a giant room, or in a giant cavern. But guess it didn't matter. What counts is being able to tell the good guys from the bad guys. The good guys are a diverse lot, who are attractive, witty, and have a wry sense of humor. The bad guys, are humorless, sometimes rancid in appearance, unless they're in drab uniforms, and evidently have no particular philosophy or motivation other than to kill the good guys.But, don't worry, it's not intense, because important characters, when killed, don't necessarily stay dead. Keeps it all fun.But let's face it, the mail impetus of Star Wars is, and has always been . . . To sell toys and lunchboxes.",3,34,47,29 April 2020
American Hustle," Sound improvised? Think it was.
","Seems to me like: Bunch of actors given vague, contrived, oh so quirky over the top plot line and told to improvise dialogue. Result - overacting, boring, mundane dialogue. If not for professional sets, resembles high school drama class exercise. Is there something about organized crime, politics and FBI operations in here? Really? Seriously? I think the hustle is that this movie is good.",1,4,6,4 December 2018
The Favourite," Not for everyone
","If you want a historical drama that attempts to provide a window on what those times might have been like .... this isn't it.If you want a vastly entertaining, twisted, drama/comedy on human love and manipulation, give this a try.",9,2,4,8 August 2019
Marriage Story," Shallow and Boring.
",Nothing new or particularly insightful here. Well off intelligent people act inexplicably stupid. Inexplicable because the characters are pretty much superficial stereotypes. I mean you get lines like 'Don't compare me to my father! '. Why not? We really don't know. Generic cute looking kid there as a plot device for the adults to fight over.If you want couple angst watch an Ingmar Bergman movie. For that matter Kramer vs Kramer showed it more effectively.Really don't get professional critics anymore.,5,8,23,13 December 2019
Mother!," Doesn't work as allegory; or anything else.
","Yes, I get it that it's an allegory with biblical references. That doesn't make it deep or good. An allegory, in addition to its symbolism, should work on an emotional level. Mother Nature? The character is whiny, clueless, and maddeningly passive. Not my idea of Mother Nature. God? He is narcissistic, oblivious, and utters not a single thought that is wise, insightful, or anything deeper than a muddled Hallmark card. I'll never purchase a movie again based on critics' ratings.",3,1,3,7 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Simplistic good vs evil.
","The good are all good, and appealing, self-sacrificing, never hurt anyone but the evil ones. Good soldiers.
The evil are all evil, kill indiscriminately, have no morals, and we rejoice when any of them, even their soldier minions die.Specialness (like a almost religious connection to 'the force') is inherited. Kind of like royalty.There is no ambiguity, no subtlety, no moral complexity.But, just a kid's movie, so what does it matter? Makes warfare seem fun.",3,3,9,22 December 2019
