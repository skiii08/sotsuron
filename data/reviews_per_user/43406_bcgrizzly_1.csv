Blade Runner 2049," Over-hyped, mostly a snoozer
","Should've been called Gosling 2049. The long closeups of Gosling and often just his face take up way too much of the movie's time. Not enough action, lots of slow scenes that look more like a poster advert than a movie scene. Very weak and simplistic story line and yet they managed to fumble it so that the overall story is 'smeared' over the 2h40min into an illogical mess. The visuals are good though and the few action scenes are done well too. Good, strong main characters, both male and female. Good to see the Hollywood feminazis didn't get their claws into this one.",5,9,20,6 October 2017
