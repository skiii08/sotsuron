","When you leave theater you may feel why Bennett Miller of Moneyball didn't sign this project, though Craig done a good job. He kept the pace cracking jokes but one may feel what he's trying to convince the audience. Is it about the boys struggle or about the life of J. B. Bernstein. If you're looking forward for a baseball game, Man.. stay on your couch grab a coke, turn on your TV.Jon Hamm got the texture of one classic fine actor. He proved it through the series Mad Men. The film is a mix of hope, courage, determination and struggle that one face in a situation, through the eyes of these two fine players from India and one great hero. These will remain in your thoughts till the last pitch.",7,1,6,9 May 2014
