Raiders of the Lost Ark," The great adventure
","I was very luck to see such films of entertainment before they were introduced to China enormously.Among them ,I preferred Ford's works as the Fugitive,star wars and the Jones' series.Each boy dreamed of being a hero, but not all persons have the chance to go around the world,enter the pyramid,dance with wolves fight against the enemies of the human being and survive immensely fierce gun shots.We need a hero on the screen to fulfill the dream,and that,Jones is right the person.what else interests me is that the two great directors George and Steven cooperated to produce the classical work as well as the great composer Williams.The symphony is the best collection of mine.In fact,The last crusade is actually the favorite,but The lost ark is the beginning of the great adventure.",10,1,3,25 December 2004
12 Angry Men," It shows a lot
","Actually,I seldom saw movies produced by Hollywood before 1980's.So I draw some conclusions that American movies are simply action or sex movies with shocking pictures.My compatriots often laugh at them as no deep contents.But as I see some films which are not so popular in my country,they enlighten me a lot about America nowadays as well as before.'12 Angry men' doesn't begin with ferry scene,but very fascinating subsequently,it raises my blood pressure,and exits me very much.I have ever read about novels written by John Grisham such as 'the runaway jury'and know something about jury system,yet no concrete comprehension.I hold the marrow of America jury system that if there is no enough evidences to prove the suspect guilt,he is then innocent,even if there is a 11:1.It's a pity I don't know the end of the story but I believe '12 angry men' is one of the best Hollywood works. I imagine its final result is like the Shawshank Redemption,which moves me and encourages me.Another thing I'm still wondering is that why western people have involved in democracy for centuries and still have a strict law ;on the contrary,Chinese citizens are familiar with being ruled but not caring about the law.",10,2,4,10 December 2004
The Longest Day," no exact word on earth could clearly describe the the story
","I think no exact word on earth could clearly describe the the story and the historical event.A war picture like Save Private Ryan is very exciting,but Steven just concerned on about 9 people in a great battle.We haven't an overall perspective of a war for many years.Someone just wants to cover something.Although it's a black & white picture but much more attractive than many things today.'The longest day' and 'Tora Tora Tora' and 'Patton' are the most excellent war movies,in my opinion.Besides,Paul Anka's music is very nice,too,identical to Jerry Goldsmith's works.Unfortunately,it has no probability that another film like it will be come out.",10,3,8,5 May 2005
The Dark Knight," A hero movie with no heroes
","A hero with super weapons and giant muscle is not very special, at least in Hollywood. No one wonders that the comic heroes play great roles that everybody dreams of but never will come true. Once the man or woman does something without his or her 'ability', but fight against villains through the normal way, we consider that special. Some Chinese fans aren't quite familiar with the US's comic culture, as well as the variety of super heroes, people always consider all heroes are like Superman, insuperable. So, as a result a hero starred film does not surprise viewers and is given a low rating. Long before I saw the Dark Knight, there were lots of news about it, and what stunned me was that it was rated over 9.0. It looked quite impossible because in my opinion only those motion pictures like God Father and Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo should deserve that kind of enormously incredible rating. Recent films rarely received a bunch of favorable views, for most of the audiences nowadays are critical and censorious. Yesterday I finally saw this movie in the dark, as I was sitting in the dark. A first psychological reaction was depression, although the Gotham City was not as dark and hopeless as in another 4 Batman movies. I knew that Chris Nolan was good at movies dark and dazzling plots. In this dark film, Batman just improved his armor because he was bitten by a dog. His car was broken down many times; we saw bruises on his back. When super ability couldn't deal with the trouble, citizens might need mast Wayne to pull the gun. Americans are proud of their judicial system, but in Gotham it failed. The D.A was desperate because he couldn't fight criminals at court. Instincts call on hero, with his power. But there are no heroes at all ,just ordinary people. Even though I thought it wasn't reasonable that Dent transformed because of his Half face and loss of Rachel. And he could not possibly do so much damage to the villains. I won't expect another dark movie on IMDb top 10.",9,3,8,16 November 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the real end of a legend
","The end!That is the real end of a legend which lasts for 28 years long.I am lucky enough to see it in a cinema on 20th May ,the first day the great film runs in China.It is visually stunning battle and more violent than former 5 episodes.Darth Vader comes out instead of an ever upright handsome young warrior.A girl sitting beside me last night was very upset when Anakin disappeared. All warriors except 3 deceased and a time of Republic is over.Joda and Obi-wan are hermits before Luke is coming.So many scenes will not be seen forever.There will be no sabers swinging on a fire lake,no force used to protect justice,no lover's tears dropping out of affection.Goodbye Anakin,goodbye Padme,goodbye C3PU&R2D2,goodbye Han Solo,goodbye Jedi warriors,goodbye a world of star-wars!Good luck to you George,I will always remember these you give us.",10,3,5,21 May 2005
WALL·E," Great masterpiece of Pixar
","It is a warm film, although it happens nearly a thousand years from today, and on the planet filled with trashes and wastes (One might ask who did this to the earth, the answer is clear) . I feel a little uncomfortable at the beginning because it is easily accepted that romance occurs between man and women with beautiful faces. Two robots are hardly imagined to be together. Soon I was touched by the infatuated affection of WALL E, and affected when the deserted planet was once our homeland. It is beautiful when the two danced out of the spaceship under a nebular, and more exited as the fainted offspring finally fly back to their home. Pixar did great job that combine a Sci-fiction story with humanity and fantasy of robot-romance. Children are definitely like it and adults also take fancy of the animation. The final pictures that demonstrate the whole evolution of human culture are brilliant. Pixar presents an excellent piece in 2008.",10,0,3,24 November 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," what an exciting film it is!
","It's the most impressing movie I've ever seen.I saw it coincidentally but was shocked very much by Tim and Morgan's acts.Especially at the end of the movie,I am aware of what is hope and how one can keep his mind alive.Is there anything more difficult for a single person to dig a hole through a wall in a jail within 19 years?We always consider it as one out of ten films that men have to see in his life(certainly it's on top).It's very pity that the Academy Reward neglected it,Tim should win all awards in 1994.Although few people have heard it before but if one is asked to see it ,he is surely very fond of it and thinks it is the best .I believe that Redemption will stay as long as I live on my mind.",10,0,1,26 November 2004
Toy Story 3," Hooray! Pixar!
","Very few motion pictures or animations can touch me for I have seen enough to immune from all kinds of clichés. But Tory Story 3 does. The only thing dissatisfied me was the 3-D glasses, Pixar does not need that technology to make its works perfect, and once again. I reviewed the others toy stories right after I came back from the theater and finally convinced myself that no one on the earth could make plastic toys strike adults again and again. I was a teenager when toy story 1 was on TV in China. The sequels amuse children for they are really funny, but express further more towards elder people. When we grow older, people will find out that so many beautiful things are gone and affections fade away. Like Andy I put behind most of my toys before going to college, unfortunately I do not have a Woody to recover me.. Although I didn't cry during toy story 3, I was totally overwhelmed for Pixar did another excellent job. WALL-E and Up surprise me so much that I can not believe Pixar is able to do better.The truth is toy story 3 is the best. Pixar gives us lessons about how to innovate and carry out those innovations. I'm looking forward to what's coming next.",10,1,2,2 July 2010
