The Mask," Hello
",This is a really good film the only problem is its to short and it needed more time with the mask in it. Cant wait for the sequel. Casting was very good with cameron diaz playing the babe shes like so hot. If you've ever seen the mask cartoons its very good this film because it makes it seem like a cartoon but its real actors which is most impressive. Jim carrey was the perfect man for the part. Hope to see him again in the sequel if possible. Cameron Diaz was like sooooo hot in that film. Although shes hot everywhere. Shame Britney wasn't in it or Christina that would of made the film a lot better with those to babes in it. A really good film for 1994 but a hell of a long wait for the sequel. its been 10 years,Null,0,0,3 November 2004
