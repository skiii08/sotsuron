The Devil's Advocate," The Devil himself boycotted this movie
","What do Al Pacino, Charlise Theron, and Keanu Reeves all have in common? Not acting school, that's for sure.  If you don't believe me (and I know you do), go and see 'The Devil's Advocate.'Reeves plays Kevin, a money-hungry lawyer whose winning streak and ability to defend low-lifes attracts the attention of big-time New York City lawyer John Milton (yes, like the `Paradise Lost' poet).  Milton (Al Pacino) gives Kevin a NYC apartment, a huge salary, parties, and a brand new high profile murder case.  Pretty soon things start getting weird.  Kevin's wife, Marianne (Theron), starts seeing things and becomes convinced Kevin's new colleagues are demons - is she crazy, or is she right?  Dum-dum-dum-dumm! [dramatic chord]  Along the way there are lots of jury selection scenes, paper-shredding scenes, lesbian insinuation scenes, and scenes where Al Pacino raises his voice.  Dum-dum-dum-dumm! [another dramatic chord]  And Keanu?  Well, he pretty much stays the same. [no dramatic chord]The thing is, it wouldn't be that bad if Keanu kept his voice low, whispering lawyer phrases like `Objection, your honor,' in a sultry, growling voice.  That way I wouldn't have to hear him *try* to be southern, because he's clearly not.  One semi-twangy word every couple of lines ain't quite like having your car horn beep `Dixie' as you drive through Hazzard County.But to be fair, I think he felt the need to keep up with Al Pacino, whose acting secret has finally been revealed: the yell.  Yes, Mr. Pacino-we don't care if you're robbing a bank, joining the family business, doing the tango blind on the dance floor or tackling the tobacco industry  just go ahead and yell.  `Hoo-wah!'  And now that you've been cast as Satan, what better opportunity will you ever have to yell more than this?  But, if you're not going to yell, for instance during the high-class party scenes or the lesbian insinuation scenes, when yelling would simply be inappropriate, then just grin, throw your head back, and let out one of those word-famous guffaws.  `Hah!'  Oh, how we love Al's guffaws.The most entertaining part comes when Keanu and Al clash at the climax. Here is one of the best actors in the world and one of the worst actors in the world, and they're just yelling at each other.  After a while I didn't even care what was going on anymore, because all the essential secrets of the film were somehow revealed right before the yelling part, so for me it just seemed like an excuse for both of them to scream.'My God, you're a bad actor!''Whoa!'Charlise Theron wins the `Lawyer-wife-who-slowly-goes-insane-throughout-the-course-of-the-film' award.  Craig T. Nelson wins the `Why-are-you-in-this?' award, simply because that's what I kept wondering.  Jeffrey Jones (one of the most underrated actors of our time) gets the award for `Best-portrayal-of-a-central-park-mugging-victim' and Pacino wins for `Best-capped-teeth,' and also the `Most-outrageous-way-of-setting-holy-water-on-fire' award.All in all, it's hard to tell what this film's message is-all lawyers are inherently evil and the spawn of Satan, or is this a clever analogy meant to question our own ethics and morals?  I'm going with the spawn of Satan message.My grade for `Devil's Advocate': C",Null,0,1,28 July 2001
Chicken Run," finger-lickin' good
","Chickens.  Lots and lots of chickens.  Chickens from England, walking, running, and knitting.  There's something really funny about British claymation characters, something that the creators of `Wallace and Grommit' have known for quite some time.  `Chicken Run', their first full-length animated feature, brings together elements of `The Great Escape', `101 Dalmatians', and even some `Star Trek' to create a hilarious, smart, vegetarian conscious movie.The crisis: the chickens are prisoners at a farm where unproductive hens are turned into dinner and even the prolific ones are treated like egg-laying slaves.  The farm's evil owner then has a moment of fiendish clarity and realizes that gathering and selling eggs is boring. Making chicken pot pies would be much more profitable and probably a heck of a lot more fun, so she buys a pie machine.  Well, you can't make pot pies without breakin' a few chickens, but since they're so cute--well, as cute as British chickens can be--we don't want them to die!  We want them to run and fly outta there!  Wait--chickens can't fly or can they?They answer is - no, of course chickens can't fly, sorry to disappoint you.  But they can sure try, and try they do.  This becomes one of the most entertaining parts of the whole film, as most training montages tend to be.  With the help of a flying rooster (voice of Mel Gibson), and the leadership of funky chicken Ginger (the daughter from TV show `Absolutely Fabulous'), the ladies try everything from leaping off rooftops to being flung in giant slingshots, all with hilariously unsuccessful results.  Meanwhile, the evil farmer becomes all that much closer to completing her pot pie contraption, and the chickens still don't know how to fly.Before they can escape they'll have to face the facts and realize that to get out they'll have to use their brains instead of their funny-looking wings.  Each chicken has a special skill, from knitting (the fat, naive chicken) to engineering (the Scottish one with bad vision) that will have to work together to get them out.       
Boy, the theme sounds corny, but it definitely works in this film.`Chicken Run' teaches that although we can't fly, we have the right to say `Buwaaauck!' and eat corn off the ground as free fowl, without worry of laying eggs or becoming pot pies.  Besides that, those little faces are enough to keep you entertained and wondering just how much patience someone must have to animate a film like this.My grade for `Chicken Run': A",Null,0,0,18 July 2001
The Mummy Returns," The Sequel that Greed Built
","'The Mummy Returns' is a very LOUD sequel that is really about 10 movies condensed into one.  Unfortunately, not one of those movies is very interesting.  Breaking down the plot to make sense would actually require a 10'x10' flowchart and a PowerPoint presentation, so I'll do my best without those.The movie starts off with an army of people yelling at an army of snarling CG Enubis warriors.  One of those armies is led by The Scorpion King (Duane 'The Rock' Johnson), who gets his power from a cumbersome bracelet.  There's a lot more yelling and screaming and somehow the King sells his soul to the God Enubis for the use of his army.  But for some reason the King can't use the army until he arises back from the dead at some point in time, which of course just happens to coincide with the rest of the events of the movie.  Confused yet?A few centuries later, some people decide to wake up Imhotep, the mummy that we all thought died for sure in the first movie.  Obviously, these idiots didn't pay to see 'The Mummy' 2 years ago or they'd know that whenever Imhotep wakes up he's always in a bad mood and feels like taking over the world.  Still, you'd think their reasons for resurrecting him would be justified.  Wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  Nothing in this movie is justified.  They want to wake up Imhotep because he's the only one powerful enough to kill the Scorpion King and his army of Enubis.  But whoever kills the King gets to take over the army, and so, once again, someone will have to kill Imhotep.  Can I ask something?  If Imhotep is more powerful than the S. King, and we don't think we can fight the King, how are we then supposed to kill the practically unstoppable Imhotep?Wouldn't it make sense to just kill the Scorpion King and eliminate the middle mummy?  Our usual heroes are back from the first movie: Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser); his wife Evelyn (vamped-out Rachel Wise); and the sexy Ardeth Bay (Oded Fahr), one of those Mummy guardian people who are SUPPOSED to keep all this disastrous stuff from happening in the first place. And now we also have Alex, Rick and Evelyn's love child.After coming home to London from an expedition, Alex accidentally puts on the Scorpion King's magic bracelet and is then kidnapped by the people who happen to be resurrecting Imhotep in a nearby museum. So now Rick, Evelyn, and the usual gang must try and find their son before the Scorpion King wakes up and wants his jewelry back. 
On their way to find Alex, the group destroys a double-decker bus, sets fire to a library, somehow makes it back to Egypt, and recruits a token funny black guy to pilot a wishy-washy blimp that will take them to the Scorpion King's resting place.  Meanwhile, Ardeth has recruited all the guardians to help in the fight against one or more of the bad guys (pick one, who cares?).  The folks who kidnapped Alex are now accompanied by the resurrected Imhotep are also on their way to pay a visit to the Scorpion King.  Remember?  Imhotep is supposed to kill him, and we'll kill Imhotep.  Oy, and, as if there wasn't enough happening already, the gang encounters these pygmie-type gremlin things in a bizarre oasis outside the Scorpion King's pyramid.  The pygmies run around in the tall grass of the oasis and kill people.  They looked fake and were pretty pointless.  Speaking of fake, if you blink at all while watching this movie, it's like missing out on $10,000,000 worth of computer graphics, including a wall of water that looks as if it were drawn in crayon by a 3 year-old, and a very fake Scorpion King in his 'scorpio' form (I suppose the Rock was unavailable for pick-ups).  Other than being visually assaulting, the soundtrack consists of a looping 'ARRRRRRRG!' type sound, and, at the end, when everything inexplicably self-destructs, there's just a deafening 'WHOOOSSSSHHHH!' mixed in with the 'ARRRRRGGGGG!'  Even the ending credits are loud.This movie will make so much money.",Null,1,2,18 July 2001
