Blade Runner 2049," Great Movie
","Well, whole movie was great, atmosphere was spot on, story good but not great, the biggest disappointment was the music, well, there was no music just sound effects. This was a disappointment because Vangelis made a masterpiece soundtrack for the first movie... 
Great acting, great ideas. 
The lack of music is the reason i gave this movie a 7 star rating because the movie by it self is a 10!",7,0,3,5 January 2018
Your Name.," A Beautiful Masterpiece
","In today's world where every single movie or cartoon is made for the masses without any human touch where all characters look like robots. Well, this movie is a complete opposite. Amazing story and beautiful artwork will take you into this film as you are the one of the protagonist, you will feel exactly what they feel and that is something i haven't experienced in a while.",10,3,4,13 January 2018
Aquaman," Good but not great.
","Ok, visuals are nice especially in the second half of the movie but what is it with the teatrical overacting? That was unwatchable. The black villain costume that looks like Alpha 5 robot from power rangers was beyond stupid. Music was really good. This movie is almost unwatchable but i made it to the end.",5,0,0,10 March 2019
