Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A bit Quick!!!
","What the hell was going on in the first 15 minutes!  Only thanks to reading the novel a few weeks before hand was i able to keep a grasp on what was going on.  I think Lucas tried to cram as much as possible in to the time alloted, he could have made it 3-3.5 hours if he wanted.  Mind you I had to sit through Daas Boot in two sittings.  For some reason i want to go and watch it again. I don't know why..........I leave you with this, no wonder young Skywalker turned to the dark side if his mom kept calling him ANNIE!!!!!!!!",7,0,0,17 August 1999
The Matrix," 'There is no spoon.....'
","One of those films that you just have to see again straight away, (or as soon as is possible).  What can you say about this films impact on the Leather market and what it has done for Erricson phones?  The soundtrack, remarkable.  Laurence Fishburne, astounding.  Carrie-Anne Moss,  sex on a stick and Keanu?.....Well he just looked down right cool!Brilliant film from the brothers Wachowski to go along with the brilliant 'Bound'.  Definitely a film for our generation!",10,0,1,14 July 1999
