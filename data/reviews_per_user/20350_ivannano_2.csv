Walk the Line," Good movie, but somewhat hollow
","I've seen quite a few of these music bio-pics. In comparison, this one is better than most, but certainly not the best.There is a large 'buzz' around the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. But like the movie itself, it rings a little hollow.It is more like this movie is a good career move for each actor than great performances.Joaquin does a pretty amazing job at capturing Johnny Cash's sound and style. And I was surprised at how good Reese sounded.That might be the problem with the movie. June Carter was not a great singer. The fact that Hollywood decided to remove her very strong country twang, also removed what made her a respected country artist - her honesty.It is true that Nashville has turned it's back on this 'Mountain Folk' country sound, but that was not the case in the 60s. So this June Carter ends up sounding more like Shania than any female country artist from that era.But in the end, go see this movie. It is much better than most of the drivel that Hollywood has been putting out this last year.But if you want to see some great music bio-pics, rent 'Lady Sings The Blues' or 'The Buddy Holly Story'",7,2,5,19 November 2005
Hereditary," If you think Saw is a great horror film, you won't like this
","Truly scary films are not based on people being chased/hacked by someone with an axe. True horror is a seemingly normal life which is not what it seems. It's of forces guiding you toward their own evil ends over which you have no control.So if you want gore or a body count, then don't watch this film.If you want a slow building movie with some genuinely terrifying moments or if you simply love Toni Collette, take the time to watch this. You won't be disappointed.",8,0,1,25 August 2018
