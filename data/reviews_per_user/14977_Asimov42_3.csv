Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Honestly, I can't see the 'disappointment' behind this.
","I think the hate behind this film is fueled by the fact that people expected Star Wars to be perfect. And it wasn't. Especially considering that George Lucas was back at the helm as director. Only a few flaws keep it from being great.The first being that it is too slow. Half way through the film the characters show up on a planet named Corusant. These twenty to thirty minutes of film are probably the most boring and pretentious of the entire saga. Consisting of long court scenes that are too slow and for the most part lack emotional drive.The next being Lucas' newest creation Jar-Jar Binks, a Gungan from the planet Naboo. I understand that he supposed to appeal to the younger crowd, so I can't speak for them. But as creation for anyone above the age of 12, he's simply annoying after a while. While I can see him being manageable in small doses.The unfortunate casting of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. I doubt that this is the best Lucas could do. As he is rarely genuine and believable and is an all around bad actor. Much of his most embarrassing moments, acting wise, could easily have been edited out and saved us the cringe of watching dialogue that is either corny dialogue or a corny actor reading dialogue. I'm inclined to believe the latter.Other than that and a few nitpicks, this film has nothing really incredibly wrong with it. It's solid, it's plot holds up, sets up the next film, while still being it's own film. Not to mention it's amazing and ground breaking visuals. It's a good film that doesn't deserve the hate that it receives.",7,15,29,23 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas improves, but not without a few missteps
","As I said in my review of Episode I. The reason I think people hate the new Star Wars films is that they expected Star Wars to be perfect, and it wasn't. It seems that most people think in terms of whether a film was great or it sucked. So if you don't think a film was great (as in it was okay) they immediately decide that it was bad, especially if it's predecessor was considered great.Like Episode I, this film flawed, good but flawed. Gone are the days of boring pretentious court room scenes, but they are replaced with new cracks in the armor.The love story could have been beautiful if not for the fact that the dialogue is so cloying. Although it doesn't affect the movie in full since it only primarily appears in scenes between Anakin and Padme, this may be a throw back to old romance movies that Lucas grew up with, such as the couple rolling around in the grass. Lucas has done many throwbacks and referenced films he grew up with, here it didn't work.My assessment from my last review proves correct, Jar-Jar has been downsized to a representative of Naboo. He appears, then leaves, then appears again for a moment, then leaves, small doses work very well.Then comes the casting of Hayden Christensen, while he isn't as bad of an actor as Jake Lloyd, who portrayed Anakin Skywalker in Episode I. Christensen has very expressive eyes, and I can welcome him into the part because of his resemblance of both Luke Skywalker and Jake Lloyd's Anakin. It's when he opens his mouth that I lose my admiration of his acting ability.He seems to lack confidence in himself and his ability to say Lucas' words, even though they may be corny his lack confidence can also be seen in Shattered Glass as well. Mark Hamill originally said that while he was doing his first reading for Luke Skywalker he thought 'Who talks like this?' to compensate he just read it sincerely. This is the best advice anyone could give Christensen. He would be a great actor if he could just gain confidence in himself and his ability.Besides that and a few nitpicks, like Episode I, this is a decent addition that, again, does not deserve the hate it receives. The visuals continue to thrill, the story sets up for the next/final chapter, and Ewan Mcgregor catches eyes as he appears to be one of the best actors in the trilogy, developing his Obi-Wan closer to Alec Guinness's. While I'm giving it a 7 out of 10, the same as Episode I, but I really wish I could give it more of a 7.5 out of 10. Since it is not necessarily as great as the original films, but I prefer this film over Episode I tremendously, simply because I would rather take corny scenes and fun scenes over boring scenes and fun scenes.",8,0,1,12 April 2005
Blade Runner," Visually impressive, but lacks story and focus.
","Like I said, visually impressive, but lacks focus on the main character. Most of the film is spent watching the antagonist(s) story, while slightly interesting it is not very compelling or attention grabbing. It's simply there in front of your face. When we cut back to Deckard's story it is more interesting but lacks material to generate a good engaging story that we desire. Hence at the end, the film feels half-baked. If another writer, or even the same writer, did another couple of drafts on the screenplay it probably would have made a world of difference. Sadly Blade Runner wasn't given those extra drafts.",4,7,18,23 February 2005
