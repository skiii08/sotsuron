The Ring," One of only three great horror movies
","I always love to see a good horror movie. Almost always I am disappointed. There are very few movies in the genre that I really like and think `A-Ha, that's a good scary movie'. Some of what qualifies usually under this genre I don't think as `horror/scary ` movie (like the six sense and psycho). I hate slasher movies. I loved `the others' but as a good `ghost story' that is lightweight. There are only 3 memorable scary movies for me: The Exorcist (of course, #1), `Angel Heart' (underrated, not many people saw it even though it had Robert DeNiro and Micky Rourck) and now `The Ring'. Here is finally a movie that is creepy enough, close enough to home, and has one original new scary though and scene thay you will remember forever.",Null,1,1,23 March 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," My personal favorite
","It was a great and a pleasant surprise to see that the movie that I chose almost five years ago as my favorite movie of all time is the number one on the list. Although it's my favorite, my choice was based mostly on my personal reaction toward this movie and I did not expect that there are so many people that feel the same way I do about it. I love every single thing about this movie, every single shot. And believe me I know what I'm talking about because it's the only movie that I've seen so many times and it never failed to amaze me.A great story based on Steven King's novella, great direction by Frank Darabont, and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman. Not to mention music, and the truly original and always inventive dialogue. Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned all the obvious great things about it. I would like to add one thing that made this movie even more spectacular to me. The movie contains scenes that present a complete idea that stand and work on its own. Like the scene when Andy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof. Critics might choose others, but there's no other movie touched my soul like this one, and I've seen thousands of them. Remember 'Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies'.",10,3,5,11 May 1999
Trainspotting," One of the most original movies ever
","By far, the best movie I've seen in 1997 (a year later than its release). Very original, thought provoking, disturbing, and strangely enough: a lot of fun. Nobody dares to go this far these days, and when they do, they don't make it as good. When I compile my best of the 90's list, this one is definitely going to be high on it.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
