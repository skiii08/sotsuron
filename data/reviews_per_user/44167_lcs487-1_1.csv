United 93," A touching, powerful and moving tribute to the victims of 9/11
","Superb dramatization of the events of 9/11 as they unfolded, and the events that occurred on United Airlines Flight 93, the flight that crashed in the field of Shanksville, PA. It is filmed with painstaking realism and every moment is captured through a documentary style of film-making. There is not ONE actor that you would notice right off the bat, several of the film's pilots, air traffic and military personnel play themselves. It is as if you are there with them...and are helpless to do something. We see the flight as it happens and what occurred on the ground. It is as real as it gets. It is basically a recreation of those two to three fateful hours on the ground and in the air. You see both World Trade Center towers get hit and feel the intensity and sadness all over again. You feel a personal connection to the victims and it is incredibly emotional to witness the victims saying goodbye to their families. You see the chatter and conflicting information among the military and you are brought in the plane and on the ground. What separates this from a standard movie was that this truly happened and you are brought back to the place you were on September 11th. One scene that will stay with me was when terrorists attacked some of the passengers, a stewardess and a pilot in a brutal and bloody fashion and you feel like you are in there with everyone. While not gratuitous, it was every bit as intense and I almost had to turn away from the screen but I just couldn't. I must warn you, this is a VERY intense film from start to finish and is by far one of the most intense films I have ever seen. You will come away feeling something from this film, and it earns my highest (and rarest) recommendation. This is a powerful, remarkably moving and tasteful tribute to all of the victims of September 11th and not just those who perished on Flight 93. Please, please make the effort and muster the courage to go see this film.",10,0,2,8 May 2006
