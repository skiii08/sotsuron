Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh please, another grab the money and run film.
","I went to the cinema with my 10yrs old little brother. We were both very disappointed. My brother commented he could write a better story himself. The movie is a one big bundle of special effects and characters without any depth in them. The writer could have made a great story out of the concept, focusing on the intrigues in the collapsing republic and the Hitler-like rising to power of the emperor. Instead, they focused on that Jar-Jar and that annoying, would-be darth, kid. It's not a film for adult people, sadly, even my kid brother thought it was a waste of time and money. Out of pity, I give this movie a score 4 out of 10.",3,0,1,31 January 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Artistic Tour-de-force
","I love artistic design, I also love good characters and a crack plot. Tim Barton's 'Sleepy Hollow' offer them all with the added grotesque of an anatomy book. Tim Barton have mercy for no one, in showing the cruelty of the time (the year 1799) he spares the audience not a single horror. Even breaking a formidable holywoodian law. Barton's headless horseman is unstopable machine of horror and death, you could feel the despair of his victims. The main character Ichabod (Like Captain Ahab, this character also have a cursed name - indignity) is magnificently played by Depp. His overacting in the tradition of the 20s silent pictures makes his character both funny and powerful. Alas some of the other characters are dwarved next to him and acting like a cliche. I give this picture 8.5 out of 10, and in my scale that's a lot. Go see the picture, unless of course, you are too scared of blood and severed organs, hahahaha....",Null,0,0,13 May 2000
