Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Awe of Lucas
","What a wonderful movie.  I really can't say more.  I went into this movie expecting so much and also somewhat expecting to be let down, but I was not. I was in awe the whole time at the STUNNING visual effects.  Not to mention the wonderful writing and tie-ins with the future episodes.  The critics have not been giving it the best reviews.  Well they screwed up on the first three by not saying they were very good, and they have screwed up again (not like they get many things right) This movie is definitely worth the hype and the legend it continues to feed.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Brilliant writing, Oscar Winner, for sure!
","I went into this movie not knowing for sure what it was about, I mean, I knew the basics.  Shakespeare, la de da.  WOW, was I impressed.  This had some of the most brilliant writing I have seen in a movie in a VERY long time.  The acting was amazing and Joseph Fiennes was especially brilliant.  I give this movie my best wishes to do well so that we may encourage other writers to follow in the same greatness!",10,0,0,26 December 1998
