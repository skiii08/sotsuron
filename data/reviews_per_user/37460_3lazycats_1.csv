The Monuments Men," It's a good movie, but it should have been much better.
","What a wonderful movie this could have been; the subject is exceptional - but this script is watered-down, sanitized to a point where it's neither a docu-drama, mystery, a heist or even much of a war movie. I've seen documentaries on the subject that were far more engaging.It's a fairly good movie for a Sunday afternoon, but overall it's forgettable which is an injustice to the source material.",7,0,0,6 July 2020
