Blade Runner 2049," a visual masterpiece and one of the best sequels ever made
",Blade runner 2049 is a surprising squeal that manages to improve upon the original source material and tell a compelling story blade runner 2049 is a film every squeal should aspire to be the film works in so many ways and the more times you see the movie the more you will get out of it the story was very well done and manages to keep invested the whole way through all the performances where all great overall. the movie stands out with its sound track and visuals the sound track had this really good creeping but atmospheric tone and the visuals where phenomenal pretty much every scene in this movie had me awestruck and as a Hollywood movie it caught me by surprise going into this film not knowing much about the director i was expecting this film to be nothing special but denis villeneuve turned this film into something that will be remembered and inspire future film makers its a shame this film haven't made as much money as everybody was hoping for if more people gave films life these a chance we would be getting more movies like this. if you haven't seen this movie i hope this review will change your mind on that if you don't see this you could be missing out on one of the best squeals ever made i'm giving this film a 9/10,9,3,8,26 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," bland and boring another marvel movie
",Thor Ragnarok was a boring movie that had some elements that worked but more or less is forgettable my main issue with the film is its presentation but before i get into that i have to mention some elements that worked for the most part for one some visuals were interesting to look at there were some fun moments in the film the humor at times were pretty good and thee hulk and Thor plus Loki worked well together but that's where it ends for me most of the time the film is uninteresting the villain character Hella was boring cringe worthy and non threatening i mean she does kill a lot of people but the film gives me no reason to care at all the quips and jokes at times got really annoying to hear for one most marvel movies have jokes and that's fine but more less at this point the quips and jokes feel like they belong on the how to make a marvel movie check list there is a scene early in the film where Thor is narrating to the audience but they try to past it off as him talking to a skull but for me it felt cheap and lazy and finally the thing is of course presentation now most marvel movies have this problem but i gotta say that I'm getting sick of seeing marvel movies do this they frame there movies in such a boring way that it becomes hard to be interested in there are some good looking visuals in the film but they decide to film it in a boring way and marvel has no excuse for this right now they are the biggest superhero film studio in the market and no matter what people will go see these movies so why cant marvel experiment and use film making to its best ability i mean there is no threat i mean most of the competition they have aren't really that big of a threat the dc-mu are in a bad place Sony messed up with spider man i mean the only studio that might be a threat are 20th century fox i mean with dead-pool and Logan being big hits for different reasons its showing that marvel movies aren't as great but instead of taking chances and risks marvel decides to play it safe i can't really recommended this movie to anyone but the fanboys but trust me there are better movies to see than this film,5,33,66,27 October 2017
Justice League," Justice league: The death of the superhero genre or the dc cinematic universe
",justice league had every chance to improve and make a good film at this point people seem to have such little faith in the film some came out of it surprised and said it was pretty good now before i get into this film one thing you should know about me is that i'm not a causal movie fan i consider myself a critic and a tough one at that i see some things most causal audiences don't see but just because i am like that doesn't mean my criticism of the film is invaded. i went into this film with a fresh mind i had no expectations what so ever people would tell me that it was fun and pretty good but going out off it i was really disappointed with the film the acting felt really wooden it seemed like everyone had a miserable time and it shows in the performances the plot of the film is non existent through out the film i couldn't understand or follow what would happen and in this film no one changed and no one grow as a person in the film and the main villain just reminded me of a forgettable marvel villain the tone felt really off too i guess with the response of batman v superman the studio panic ad turned it into this a happy goofy tone which doesn't work for dc what the studio failed to understand was the reason batman v superman failed because off the fact that the reason of conflict was stupid dc do make great dark story's but this film felt like it was just trying to rip off marvel another thing i dislike is the fact that in the film characters will have information that they should not know what so ever which makes the film all the more aggressively bad also the one another thing i noticed was that in this universe they are all supposed to feel connected but this film feels like it belongs somewhere else but not the DCEU the only thing i kind of liked was the flash i mean he does have some bad dialog but i feel if the writers had fixed some of the mistakes they made with him he would have worked a lot better but as is he is the only character i kind of cared for but that's all i can say that is good about this film. i will end with this there were some sources saying the first cut was unwatchable and if this film is a awful mess i can't imagine what the first cut of this film is like it was a shame how bad justice league was i genuinely hoped this film would be fun but it wasn't at all i guess you could say for me this film is the death of the superhero genre for me it represents everything wrong with the genre as a whole because the more i notice the more i see the superhero genre being boring predictable products but that's just my thoughts on justice league if you think this rating is unfair and you enjoy this film all i have to say is enjoy it all you want after all it's just my review of justice league,1,14,29,18 November 2017
The Lion King," why make a remake if you don't add anything new or unique
","This films worse feature is having no personality the orginal animated feature had so much more characterful moments in it that made it so unique and special this movie however just recreates iconic scenes and nothing else, john olivas performance as zazu stood out as being awful he was easily the worse actor in the film and james earl jones phoned it in which was a shame.
there are some people saying that this film should be judge on it's own and not compare it to the animated feature and while i half argee with judging it on it's on i do however feel like comparing them is more then fair this film is a shot for shot remake and that's it i honestly feel stupid for seeing this movie if your only seeing it to laugh at how bad it is don't bother because you will be so bored and frustrated you might end up walking out just watch the 1994 animated lion king.",1,46,69,20 July 2019
Logan," great film
",Logan is one of those rare superhero films that does so much outside of the superhero genre this film was great from start to finish telling a bleak depressing story about a man at the end of his life all the performances where great Hugh jack-man gave his best performance as wolverine/Logan the little girl who played Logan's daughter was surprisingly great and she managed to hold her own with two other talented actors and of course sir Patrick Stewart was great as well. what i love most about Logan is the fact that this film stands out from the rest of superhero films we currently get where as most of them are bland safe stupid unfunny and only exist to set up another film Logan stands out because Logan has a end it sets you in realty and it has a story to tell and best of all its emotional and when you leave the film you will still be thinking about it the film does such a great job cinematography wise every shot looks really great all the characters are memorable and the film is pretty subtle to which is surprising to say the film doesn't really feel like a superhero story either which is a plus in my book the only complaint i have is with the noir version of the film and the poster mainly because the noir version isn't as impact full as the normal version i mean there are some really good shots from both versions off the film but the noir style just doesn't fit but i guess its just for big fans of the film i didn't hate it i did like it but i feel the normal version is better the poster is a bit disappointing its just Logan standing there i have seen way better fan made posters on the internet but other than that those are the only complaints i have trust me you will love this film if you see it for the first time so go see it,8,3,7,28 October 2017
Parasite," a film that has already grown on me since watching it hours ago
",Bong joon ho is clearly a talented director from everything i have seen from him he has a key eye for slowly drawing you into the plot and keeping you at the edge of your seat i also loved how the story played with your expectations for characters in the film this film was the first in a long while that made me legitimately feel nervouse for the characters being discovered i won't spoil it but you will know what i mean when u see the film for yourself the only complants i had would be a few scenes went on a bit too long and i kept misleading myself into thinking it was going to end sooner then it did but i imagine on my second watch these issues won't be a big deal to me i mean this film has already been creeping into my thoughts since seeing it hours earlier i'm not sure if this film is a 8 or 9 or how the film holds up to the directors previous works but this film is worth your attention please if your sick of the hollywood garbage that is turned out in your local cinema please look for a cinema that's playing parasite it's worth your time and i feel it might be my favourite movie that's come out this year so get hyped and check it out and if your new to the director check out his previous movies the host and especially mother are some of his best but parasite is up there with them check it out,9,6,27,28 June 2019
