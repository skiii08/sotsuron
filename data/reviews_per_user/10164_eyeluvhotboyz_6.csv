Casablanca," Americana at its best
","Casablanca is the epitome of `Americana' films.  You have to lost lovers, the tough guy persona, and Humphrey Bogart.  There is nothing in this movie that this reviewer doesn't like. One of the most highly used story lines is in this movie, the lost lovers. A perfect romance spoiled for some reason.  This was the story in Casablanca.  Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, and Isla, played by Ingrid Bergman are these two characters.  They could not have picked a better duo for this movie.  The chemistry between Bogart, and Bergman was fantastic. Because they worked so well together, it made the story very realistic.This movie also includes the `tough guy.'  Bogart's character, Rick, is the ultimate example of this.  The best way to describe him is using one of his quotes from the movie, he sticks his head out for nobody.  He also never drinks with his customers, which shows his detachment from others.Last, but not least, this movie's star is Humphrey Bogart.  This man is Americana.  He is looked upon by many Americans as `the epitome of cool.' Although he is not an incredibly attractive man, his presence makes many people love him.This review gives this movie a 9/10.  It is a movie that many people would enjoy.  Casablanca is not recommended for children, simply because they may not understand the movie.",9,1,2,29 April 2004
Citizen Kane," Fantastic
","`Citizen Kane' is ranked one of the best movies of all time, and with good reason.  Between the lighting effects, the great talent, and the symbolism, every person could be happy watching this movie.The symbolism that is shown in this movie is truly remarkable.  In the beginning scene, there are at least three examples of symbolism.  First, there is a `No Trespassing' sign.  This shows that Kane did not like people entering his private life.  Next, there is an iron `K' on the gate. This, along with the fact that his house is built on a man-made mountain, shows that he wants to be more powerful and `set above' everyone else.The talent selected for this movie only added to its greatness.  Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane, a politician, and owner of the newspaper The Inquirer.  Throughout the movie, Orson Welles shows the emotion of every situation.  One example of this is when it shows Kane as a child.  When he finds out that he is being taken away he pushes the man over with his sled.The lighting in this movie is absolutely fantastic.  Because `Citizen Kane' is in black and white, the lighting plays a very important role.  One scene that was particularly effective was when Charles and Mrs. Kane go to talk to Mr. Gettys.  When they are having the meeting, you cannot see Gettys' face, only his body.  This is effective because it puts a `revenge' feel to the conversation.Overall, this movie is suitable for most viewers.  It includes every aspect that makes up a good movie.  Good talent, great special effects, and fantastic symbolism, just to name a few.",8,1,4,17 November 2003
Some Like It Hot," Marilyn Monroe, jazz, and the mob... you can't go wrong with that!
","Some Like it Hot is a fantastic movie, for the older crowd.  With great actors and actresses, a great plot, the mob, and a little bit of jazz, they couldn't go wrong. Some Like it Hot stars the sex icon Marilyn Monroe as Sugar.  Sugar is a musician in an all-girls band that always falls for male saxophone players. Over the course of the movie, she goes from being strong to completely vulnerable, then to completely crazy at times.  They could not have picked a better actress to play this role.  It seems like it was purposely written for her.This movie also stars Jack Lemmon, as Daphne (otherwise known as Jerry), and Tony Curtis as Josephine (otherwise known as Joe).  These two actors did a fantastic job.  They play two male musicians that witness a mob hit.  They then decide they need to leave town.  They need to disguise themselves, though, so they dress up as girls, and join an all-girl band. After the band, including Daphne, Josephine, and Sugar, arrive in Florida, the plot heats up.  Josephine (Joe) ends up falling for Sugar, who thinks he's a girl, and Daphne gets hit on but a millionaire that thinks he's a girl.  Meanwhile, the mob is still looking for the Joe and Jerry to kill them. This movie will have the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next.  It will also have them cracking up laughing.  This reviewer would give this movie a 10, but not recommend it for small children.  There are many adult themes that would not be appropriate.",10,1,2,16 April 2004
Psycho," The Master of Suspense?... yea he really is
","Psycho is a fantastic movie, mainly for those who love the details of movies.  The director, Alfred Hitchcock, was the first that did what people would call a `horror movie.'   Using camera angles, music, and voices in a person's head, he creates a truly suspenseful movie.First, he creates suspense by having voices in the character's head.  These are the voices of people that the character knows.  They generally are saying things that may be going on while the character is not there.Then he adds some camera angles.  During a time when the main character is scared Hitchcock will show the face, then quickly, move to something else. Then, when he returns to the character, the shot it much closer to the character's face.  After a few repeated times of doing this, the camera is uncomfortably close to the actor/actress' face.  Lastly, he adds the final touch; loud, clashing, orchestral music.  Music in a film can really alter the viewer's mood.  This music definitely adds to the suspense.If I were to rate this movie on a scale of one to ten (ten being great), I would give this movie a 9.5.  It is a fantastic movie that many people could enjoy.",9,0,1,20 February 2004
Rear Window," Not quite Hitchcock
","`Rear Window' is a great movie, if the viewer is into more drawn out plots. If they are only into movies that catch their attention quickly, this is not the movie for them. This film had a very unique set.  The entire movie is filmed in an indoor set.  It also is filmed so that everything is inside the apartment of the main character.  Things happen outside, but all of the camera angles are simply looking out the window.When compared to most movies, `Rear Window' is very good.  The only time this movie does not `measure up' is when compared to `Psycho', Hitchcock's more notable movie.  The Master of Suspense didn't really live up to his name in this movie.  This is supposed to be a suspenseful movie, but comparatively, it is not suspenseful at all.  Though good camera angles, and good music selection, did help things along, it did not seem to have the Alfred Hitchcock touch.Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a seven out of ten.  It is good if you have the attention span for drawn out movies.  But if the viewer is looking for `entertain me, quick' they are looking at the wrong movie.",7,1,3,1 March 2004
The Godfather," Spectacular! For the older crowd
","`The Godfather' is a spectacular movie, for the older crowd.  Between a quotable script, great theme music, and a fabulous main character, this film will keep the viewer wondering.  While watching `The Godfather', the viewer may recognize many lines.  Some of examples of those could be, ` I'll give Â‘em an offer he can't refuse,' or `Take it to the mattresses.'  Simply the fact that lines from the movie are well known, proves that this movie is worthy of watching.Throughout the movie, the same music is played over and over, but in different styles.  For example, if someone is about to get shot, the music speeds up, and almost gets scary.  When a happy time comes, the music gets softer, and more legato.Finally, one of the best things about this movie is the main character.  Al Pacino plays Michael, the child of the original Godfather.  After his father gets shot in a mob hit, Michael, takes over the family business, and completely changes who from the person he used to be.  Al Pacino is very believable in this role.Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a 9 out of 10.  It is definitely a movie worth seeing, but leave the kids at their friends, there is more gore than many would like.",9,0,2,21 May 2004
