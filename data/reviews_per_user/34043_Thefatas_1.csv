Requiem for a Dream," Sick but verry excelent
","I saw this film the first time in school on a verry big screen. Our teatcher had seen this moovie in the teathers and he said that everybody in the theater sat for about ten minutes after that the moovie had ended. Why we asked, and he replied that this moovie had touched them all so deeply so some of them had even started to cry. This moovie was excelent. It is not like a ordinary moovie, but verry artistic. Espesially I liked the scenes where the director had used different colours. This made the film verry different from a ordinary action film. Allso the special effects are good. This moovie allso makes you think about how lucky you are if you do not do drugs and you realize how lucky you really are. Allso the casting is in my oppinnion verry good.",9,0,1,14 April 2004
