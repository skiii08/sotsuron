Blade Runner 2049," Is It Ready To Be A Classic Film?
","Blade Runner 2049, in short, takes place in the year 2049 (yep, it's true). Killing replicants is still a viable job and tasked with that duty now is a young stud named Officer K (Ryan Gosling). One stormy afternoon while minding his own business killing a minding-his-own-business replicant, K unearths a secret. A crime was committed 30-years-ago but the only evidence that's of any help is an old piece of carved wood and some numbers scratched on it. The suspect in the brutal crime may have been a replicant, and it's up to K to bring the skinner to justice the only way a good Blade Runner knows how: retirement. Enter old stud Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who disappeared 30-years-ago with the last known replicant ordered to be executed (let's call it what it is). Deckard knows how to hide - being hunted for decades will teach you a few things about that. It's K's hunch that Deckard may have a little insight into this mystery that's been slowly eating away at the young Blade Runner. Now he needs to find the old man before someone less friendly does.Blade Runner 2049, IMHO, is a nice companion to the original 1982 masterpiece by Ridley Scott. I've pretty much said all I can without getting into spoilers, so I'll touch on the technical side. A movie like this requires strong, believable CGI. There must be attention to detail and it absolutely must look realistic - about as realistic as you can make fiction, I suppose. Blade Runner (1982) left us in awe with the special effects (winner of two Academy AwardsÂ® in that category). We've sort of become accustomed to great CGI now, and, for the most part, we know what CGI is capable of, so it's pretty hard to blow us away. Thus, CGI heavy movies also need a good story and good acting to hold our attention. Blade Runner 2049 has most of that. Director Denis Villeneuve (how sick was Sicario, right?) puts it all together and makes it sing beautifully, but not perfectly. It's too early to tell right now whether Blade Runner 2049 will become a classic like it's daddy; there will be plenty of nerds arguing about that - both for and against.I just like watching movies; I'm a fan not a critic, and this movie is enjoyable to watch. One that I could probably see again without getting bored. Chances are, you'll feel the same way if you made it this far.",7,0,5,5 February 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Mind-Screwing In A Good Way
","10 Cloverfield Lane, in short, is about a creepy dude, Howard (John Goodman), who claims there's been a chemical attack and that's the reasoning behind keeping a young woman, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), locked in a shelter under his equally-creepy farmhouse.Michelle doesn't believe it, she thinks he's kidnapped her. She was in a car crash, and Creepy Dude saved her. Ok, sure, but let's go to the hospital, demands Michelle. Nope, the air is poisoned, creepy Howard confidently tells Michelle, who by now is really sketched out. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) is also locked in the shelter, but he says it's by his choice. He knew about the shelter because he saw Creepy Dud building it a long time ago, so when the attack happened, Emmett rushed over to the farmhouse and essentially forced his way in. Sounds believable, right? Even Creepy Dude is locked in the shelter with them. Is Emmett in on this thing, too?The story is pretty good and keeps you in the dark. Is creepy Howard telling the truth, or is he brainwashing these two victims? There's evidence of both. Creepy Dude keeps reminding Michelle that he saved her life and she should be a little more grateful. Can't she understand that? Creepy Dude is prone to violent outbursts, but don't worry he won't hurt you, it's just the stress. After all, no one really knows how long they'll all be underground. One year, two? That'll stress anyone out, for sure. Everything is pretty convincing; everyone's story makes sense. You'll be like, WTF?I like horror movies that focus less on gore and more on storytelling to scare. This is one of those movies. It's trippy and mind-screwing in a good way. 10 Cloverfield Lane is well done.",7,2,2,7 February 2018
The Equalizer," Denzel Kicking Serious Bad-Dude-Ass as a Bad-Ass!
","I sort of remember the mid-80's TV series The Equalizer, and I sort of remember watching a few episodes. I certainly don't remember the late Edward Woodward kicking serious bad-dude-ass like Denzel Washington does as Robert McCall!First, the bad news. I know every bad-dude-ass-kicker looks good in the near-dark, lit only by a single 7k Xenon sitting high atop a Skyjack 25-yards yonder, with the pouring 'rain' twinkling all around in the background and rolling off said bad-dude-ass-kicker's weathered face and squared jaw, but was it really necessary here? I mean, come on, it looked like it was done on purpose...and not in a good way. The scene I'm talking about could have been shot somewhere else to have the same impact. Worst. Shot. Ever.More bad news: Open Memo to Hollywood: We get it, the Russians are the bad guys again but please stop, for the love of Igor, stop using non-Russian speaking actors to fill the roles needed - especially Henchmen and smaller speaking roles. We hate it when 'Russians' are actually Americans pretending to be Russian after spending an hour with a dialect coach in their trailer before their scene (I'm looking at you-who-shall-not-be-named-but-starred-in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). (Ok, so I exaggerated that a teeny bit, but her accent was terrible in that movie.) Anyway, I digress. For this movie, I'm talking about the horrible Russian spoken by ChloÃ« Grace Moretz. She plays an underage Russian prostitute with perfect English, but horrible Russian. I guess that's better than a horrible English accent and horrible Russian! I knew nothing about the plot of the movie and I didn't even know she was a Russian prostitute until the bad guys showed up! ChloÃ« is a great actress, and for her limited screen time did well...save for the parts where she needed to speak Russian! For the sake of credibility, another talented and beautiful female actress - from Russia - could have worked just fine. It's a small role with limited screen time (even ChloÃ«'s name on the one-sheet seemed like an afterthought.)Now the good news: Denzel, belovedly referred to as 'dedushka' (grandfather) by the Russians, and 'Pops' by his co-workers at the local 'Home Mart' (and that's another thing, why not make a little sponsorship cash and have Robert McCall work at Home Depot?) seriously kicks some bad-dude-ass! His character is a little OCD (I can relate) and quite inventive (oh, the things one can do with a corkscrew in under 19 seconds)!I loved Denzel in Tony Scott's Man on Fire (2004). He was almost born to play these kinds of characters (I know, right). The Equalizer is a good action film that will keep your attention, but no gnarly 80's tunes to bring you back to the days when a middle aged Edward Woodward was playing the dedushka (hmm, the Russians were our enemies then too).",8,0,2,6 November 2017
It," Jesus F**K!
","By nature I am a pretty stoic person; to a fault, in fact. When it comes to watching movies - something I really love doing - I generally sit and view them from an objective mindset. Only the very best movies actually manage to gift me empathy for the characters (I say 'gift' because empathy is not something I was born with). In saying that, when it comes to horror, or 'scary' movies, I generally have a 'meh' attitude toward them: I don't scare that easily.My headline is a direct quote from one of the characters. I chose it because that's exactly what I said, far too often in fact, while watching this movie. Coming from me, that's a sign of respect for this movie's ability to scare the stoicism right out of me.A+ all around and in my Top 50 favorite movies.",9,0,0,24 December 2017
Fury," Lerman Shines
","Fury follows a bad-ass tank crew and its bad-ass, grizzled, Nazi-hating, SS-killing leader, Sgt. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt). A new kid, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the team - pretty much against his better judgement. He's never seen the inside of a tank before and hasn't even fired a gun since basic training. He's quite certain there's been a mistake and just wants to go home.Norman is a military-trained typist. An excellent, experienced typist; 60-words a minute he can go. A worthwhile skill to have when you've got a superior officer dictating a memo, but does it work when you've got an entire division of Nazis shooting at you? Not exactly. Norman is teased relentlessly, and mercilessly slapped around by Wardaddy because he refuses to kill anyone. Norman's crewmates believe he'll get them all killed one day, and there's plenty of opportunity for that. Wardaddy is well respected by the Oldman (Jason Isaacs, whom you won't even recognize) and it's Wardaddy's crew that always get the call when there are Nazi's that need killing or Allies that need rescuing; a task that Wardaddy ruthlessly, and violently, carries out with gusto and a 'take no prisoners' attitude.Fury shows the horrors of war quite explicitly. There is enough blood and gore in this movie to make any horror film make-up artist blush. I'm confident in saying that the actions displayed on screen in Fury happened in real life during the war - during any war - even though this particular story is fiction. It's that realism that makes this film sometimes hard to watch. 'War is hell' to quote William Tecumseh Sherman. Everything is so realistic and so genuine it's nauseating.I began to hate Brad Pitt as this movie went on. He plays quite a jerk. You'll hate him too (if you don't already for some other reason). Same with Jon Bernthal (that's the guy who played Shane in The Walking Dead). He's a creepy war machine without a conscience. Shia LaBeouf plays a depressed bible-quoting, war-weary soldier, and you know something else, he's really good in this role! I was surprised, actually, because of, you know, his frequent meltdowns I figured he just went crazy and stopped acting. His character is a troubled and emotional young man, so it's not too far from reality (and the cut on his right cheek is real and self-inflicted prior to filming the movie). Logan Lerman is awesome. He's come a long way since The Butterfly Effect (2004), and I much prefer to see him in an intense role like this, surrounded by so much talent. Lerman feeds off the other actors and you can see it.Sound mix is awesome, so is the cinematography (same guy who shot Suicide Squad and End of Watch). There is a good scene when some tanks get into a battle with some stubborn Nazis. There is one shot in particular that is awe-inspiring. You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it. It's quite stunning. I don't use the term 'awe-inspiring' very often.Overall, good movie, watch it when you can.",8,2,5,8 February 2018
Darkest Hour," Oldman's Spot-On Performance Is Key
","Darkest Hour, in short: In the early months of WWII, Winston Churchill was asked by the King of England to form a new government at a time when the Brits, and all of Europe, faced what seemed like insurmountable odds. Prime Minister Churchill had to decide whether his government should essentially capitulate and negotiate a peace deal with Hitler, or fight and face possible annihilation.What I think: I saw this movie on the same day I saw Dunkirk (2017), not knowing that Darkest Hour makes several references to the 'colossal military disaster', that affected more than 300,000 solders, on the west coast of France. Darkest Hour takes place around the same time that Dunkirk takes place: May 1940. Seeing the two movies back to back was a good idea (if not fun) and if you have the means and time I suggest doing the same thing. I won't get into the why's and how's of Churchill's appointment eight months after the U.K. declared war on Germany. For that, you can do some research, although the movie does briefly touch on it to give context. The focus of this film is on Churchill's first turbulent month in office; more specifically when and how to evacuate 300,000 soldiers from Dunkirk (or leave them to the Nazis), and if surrender to the most powerful army the world has ever known should be considered ('Do you want a swastika flying over Buckingham Palace?'). I think it's safe to assume everyone already knows the answer to what happened.Two things you'll LIKE about Darkest Hour: 1) This isn't a war movie per se, it's about what occurs behind the scenes and what happens leading up to Churchill's rousing speech to Parliament on June 4, 1940, the day Operation Dynamo (the evac of Dunkirk) was complete (which is why this makes a good companion to the Dunkirk movie). Gary Oldman is nearly unrecognizable as Winston Churchill, the makeup job is amazing, as is his performance. Oldman's presentation of Churchill's unique speaking style is nearly spot on, as are his mannerisms and peculiar personality. Darkest Hour is dialogue heavy, but interesting enough to keep your attention (as if Oldman isn't enough to do that!). 2) As most period pieces are, awesome costumes and accurate design and construction of sets are paramount for authenticity. I've been to and seen the actual war cabinet room and bunkers where Churchill and his team spent most of the war, and it's pretty damn close as I refer to my photos. Darkest Hour is Oscar Nominated for both costume design and production design.Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) Coming in at just over two hours, your bladder may be ready to burst about the same time the film is ready to hit its climax. 2) Have you had enough of the subject matter yet? Hollywood has released war-era films ad nauseum since...well, almost forever. It's not going to stop anytime soon.",7,0,3,28 January 2018
World War Z," What Happened To Slow Zombies?
","I waited a long time to see this movie. For what seemed like years (it was), I remember reading in the 'Trades' about all the problems this movie had getting off the ground. I was getting a little worried as I read more and more about the issues as time went on.I like the Zombie genre and from the short clips of World War Z I was able to see before it was released, I thought this was going to be big. Like $100 million opening weekend big. Heh, yeah, I know right.I never got a chance to see the movie until just a few months ago. Was it worth the wait? Well, yes and no. Brad Pitt fans, and Zombie fans will love it, but not without some brickbats and caveats. I am a big fan of the latter, and a so-so fan of the former. I read the book before I saw the movie, and I understood the difference between the two and that is what made it even more interesting to me. Plus, I really enjoyed the book and after reading it I felt I had a good comprehension of the characters and I was prepared to see them in action now, which in the movie takes place before the book.I wasn't disappointed when I finally saw World War Z. Yeah, it could have been better (I gave it a 7...any movie that keeps my interest for at least 95% of the time gets a 7...that seems to be the median that I follow here at IMDb). But it was disappointingly sort of anti-climactic. I was expecting more, and I thought there would be more to it. After, I just sort of sat there on my cardboard box wondering, 'is that it? Did I just miss something?'It sure felt that way. It's kind of like the feeling you got when you were a kid and you wanted a dog for Christmas but got a cat instead. Or the day you went to see Star Wars but you had to sit at the back row because you were late getting to the theater. You still sort of got what you wanted, but not what you expected. But, I have seen World War Z three times already so it's not that bad. Be warned though, that could just be my OCD, just my OCD, my OCD.I have seen it three times already, but another thing that bothers me is the Zombies, which, for a movie that is mostly about Zombies, is a little bit of an issue. I completely disagree with the whole running Zombie thing – or at times sprinting! George A. Romero would be just as saddened to hear of these super-fast new Zombies that can climb walls higher than what Trump plans on building to keep the Mexicans out, and run faster than most living humans. Not to mention this super strength they have? WTF? Where did that come from? But then again, the world is moving a lot faster than it did in 1968's 'Night of the Living Dead'.I did like to see the live transformation from living human, to undead Zombie happen before my eyes. Whether that is physically possible, or not, it's still kinda cool. The CGI is awesome for those scenes, as it is for the rest of the film (well, that damn movie cost $190,000,000 to make so it better have great CGI).I wouldn't have paid whatever it costs now to go to a movie on a weekend, but perhaps middle-of-Wednesday-afternoon-prices instead. In my case, I got it free from the library 4 years after release date (yes, they still do exist and now with fancy new automated check in and check outsoon, no more librarians!).Well, now I wait yet again to get my fill of Zombie flesh. There's always the very good and reliable 'The Walking Dead' to fill the void until anther apocalyptic Zombie movie comes about. Perhaps the new string of Zombies that will soon be released upon civilization will be exactly like those in World War Z. It may have foretold our fate. We can look at World War Z as a training film.You'll soon look back on this day when 'The Idiot Savant' was right, yet again. Meanwhile, I'll be holed up in the nearest prison (voluntarily this time) with my own minions of loyal followers protecting what's left of this world from the super-fast-super- strong World War Z Zombies.",7,1,1,13 November 2017
Spotlight," Digging Up Dirt Will Get You Dirty
","In Short: There isn't much more I can say that nearly 500 other users haven't already said.You know the subject matter, proceed with caution. Tales like this are difficult to watch, especially knowing that it's a true story. Added to that misery is the knowledge that stories like this continue to happen, if not in the Church certainly in everyday society. Perhaps not the cover-ups, but assuredly the same kinds of tragedies. This movie is the epitome of of term 'thought provoking'. You will talk about it; you will discuss it; and that's exactly what needs to happen.TWO things you will LIKE about the movie: 1) The performances are nothing short of outstanding. The actors are as passionate, serious and disciplined as the real journalists and victims they portray. 2) Josh Singer, Tom McCarthy's script. This is a well written, well researched emotional masterpiece.TWO things you will NOT LIKE about the movie: 1) Digging up dirt will get you dirty almost as much as being there. This is depressing subject matter. If you're a survivor, this movie is undoubtedly a trigger. 2) The length. It's over 2 hours long, so get comfortable.",9,0,0,17 January 2018
Cloverfield," Only 2200 Reviews Ahead Of Me! But I'll Still Write Something
","Cloverfield, in short, is shot like a 'found footage' documentary and follows a group of friends around Manhattan during a monster invasion.Still interested? Read on. It's New York City, the site of many disasters (both imagined and real, unfortunately). One can assume that the events we are about to witness happened at some point in the past, because we're watching a video seized by the Department of Defense. The footage, recovered from an 'area formerly known as Central Park', is clearly taken from a camera once owned by a young couple. We know this because we see them, on video, before and during the day of the invasion.The couple attend a going away party for a mutual friend who is moving to Japan. It's at the party where we meet the cast of characters who later become the video journalists when the real fun begins. The building shakes, there's a power-outage lasting a few seconds, and there's a report on TV about a possible earthquake. Seems harmless, right? Like some giddy school children, the cameraman and his buddies head up to the roof to get a better look at a foundering ship spilling oil into the Hudson River. That's when all hell breaks loose. Luckily, they bring the camera along for the wild ride.And so begins director Matt Reeves's ode to big scary monsters. Think of the videos you've seen on the news of war photographers running for their lives, all the while continuing to record. That's what Cloverfield is like except no one is dodging enemy fire; here it's giant bug-things they're running from. The 'found-footage' genre of filmmaking isn't new, not even when Cloverfield was made 10-years ago. It's actually kind of lame, too. However, when I first saw this movie in 2008 I enjoyed it. Who doesn't appreciate seeing an apocalyptic monster invasion? They are magnificent!Cloverfield is a good action, sci-fi, horror film that's fun to watch, even if the camera work is a little too jarring at times. I like how the movie uses very little CGI (but when CGI is used, it's excellent) and relies mostly on creative, budget-friendly filmmaking. Loud monster noises, blood-curdling screams, and one's own imagination fuel the fright. Think Jaws (1975): you knew there was something scary out there, but you couldn't see it. Everyone fears what they can't see.Check out 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) and Netflix's The Cloverfield Paradox (2018). All three movies are related.",7,0,0,6 February 2018
"I, Tonya"," Think Goodfellas If They Were Morons
","'I Tonya' in short: The story of competitive figure skater Tonya Harding as told by Tonya and her henchmen: ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, bodyguard Shawn Eckardt (with apparent 'training in counter-terrorism tactics'), and her mom, LaVona (who will not be winning any mother of the year awards).If you're not familiar with why Tonya Harding and her thugs spent most of the mid-1990's as a punchline for a vast number of jokes on late-night TV, this is a good place to start...with a caveat.'Based on irony free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly' warns the title card in the beginning.The 'interviews' we see throughout the film are with the actors portraying the real people, with the idea, of course, that the actual interviews were conducted at some point. We also see clips from Tonya's bodyguard, a former tabloid journalist, and Tonya's mom (with a bird sitting on her shoulder that often steals the scene). Together, they tell the story of Tonya's life before, during and after 'the incident.''The incident' being referred to is the kneecapping of Harding rival, and apparent good friend, Nancy Kerrigan, during a practice session at the Cobo Arena in Detroit. Think of this like the Goodfellas (1990) if the Goodfellas were a bunch of white trash, moronic 'boobs' (not my word) trying to pull off a hit.Two things you'll LIKE about 'I, TONYA': 1) It's funny! The story we saw on TV in the 1990's wasn't that humorous, but how it's told here is quite fun. 2) The acting (props to Allison Janney, who plays mom) the production design, the editing, the directing. Everything seamlessly works together to keep your interest from the very beginning.Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) A lot of the story is left out, apparently. I did some research after the film to see exactly how accurate this is. I knew a little about the incident, but nothing of the aftermath. Combine the film with some Wiki research afterwards for a more fulfilling experience! 2) Your feelings for the real people involved will change. I know that's vague, but it is what it is.Favorite quote from the movie (Tonya to Jeff), 'I really think you should just kill yourself.'",8,1,1,25 January 2018
Interstellar," What e=mc2 Is In Nolanisms
","If this is not in your Top 100 favorite movies of all time, you should hang your head in shame.Every Christopher Nolan movie I've seen so far has made that list. So could be the case with you. Certainly, there are plenty of 'Nolanisms' (idiosyncrasies Director Christopher Nolan adds to most of his movies that few understand absolutely) but that's what I personally like about Nolan's movies. They make you pay attention, think differently, and be introspective. Interstellar is nearly 3- hours (!) of non-stop story telling, and nearly non-stop-Nolanisms, with twists and complicated theories about time travel and relativity and scientific mumbo- jumbo. It's told so well I actually I believe it! In fact, if Nolan were a doomsayer building a spaceship to take me to another planet when the world ends (ie Trump's reelection) I'd sign over my bank accounts and wife right now (ok, maybe not my bank accounts). That's how convincing Interstellar is.Even if none of the theory told here is ever proved, Nolan sure makes a good case for interstellar travel. But I digress. This isn't 'just' a movie for science geeks. I'm sort of a geek, but I'm an idiot and much of the 4th, and now apparently 5th dimension gobbledy gook is way over my inflated head (I still need a calculator for simple equations). But, there is also great story about love and sacrifice and family. On one hand, not having a family myself, I can understand the yearning for wanting to go away and explore space for 50+ Earth years. However, I can also understand the basic need for human interaction and the unconditional love and forgiveness one's family can bring. Having to choose between one or the other is not easy and that's exactly what McConaughey's character must do (although he seems to choose which with very little indecisiveness).There's so much more to this complex movie it's one you may need (want) to see more than once to 'get'. It's in my Top 25 so viewing it again and again is not going to be foreign to me.",10,0,0,4 December 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," You Would Do The Same
","Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell is all I needed to know about this movie before seeing it. The trio only add to an already solid script and bring it to life as the three main characters.McDormand plays Mildred, an angry, bad-ass mother who won't take shit from anybody, especially when it comes to finding her daughter's killer. Pissed off that after seven months no arrests have been made in the case she decides to take matters into her own hands - in a most unexpected way. Just down the street from her home sits three billboards long since abandoned on the side of a road rarely used after the installation of a new highway nearby. Now, however, construction has re-routed traffic back to this stretch of road, and Mildred scrapes together the billboards' rental fee to post a little message to Ebbing's Chief of Police (welcome back Woody Harrelson). The message: get off your ass and do something (I'm paraphrasing).Chief Willoughby has his own problems, and tries the sympathy card to reason with Mildred. He wants the billboards gone for the better of the town he claims, even though the law says Mildred is doing nothing wrong. She doesn't want to hear it, and pushes him further into action.Enter seemingly corrupt mamma's boy cop, Officer Dixon (played brilliantly by Sam Rockwell) who knows a thing or two about how you solve problems in Ebbing. He too, it seems, will stop at nothing to get what he wants. What he wants is to protect his good friend (and the only reason why he still has a job), the Chief.This easy-to-follow, sometimes darkly-funny movie keeps you interested right from the beginning. This isn't your typical 'I know who did it' crime-drama. This could easily be a true story, but it's not. However, the concept of using billboards to push for justice is true and happened more than two decades ago in the deep southern United States, according to director Martin McDonagh. 'What kind of pain would lead somebody to do that?' he asked himself at the time.Now we know, and I would have done the same.",9,3,5,13 January 2018
Knowing," Meh, It's OK, But Not Great
","Knowing, in short, is about professor John (Nicolas Cage), an intelligent chap who cleverly decodes a message that was unearthed in a time capsule buried 50-years ago at his young son's school.Still interested? Ok, read on. Inside of this time capsule are things like futuristic drawings and trinkets from 1959, left by school children of the day. In 2009, a new batch of children at the school open the capsule and, one by one, reach in and pull out a treasure. John's almost-as-clever son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), picks out a rather boring piece of paper filled only with numbers. It's almost befitting though. After all, the kid is very smart and has a future as an astrophysicist it seems. But he is a kid, man, and he notices that his classmates each got something cool, like hand drawn, colorful pictures imagining what life would be like in 2009 (think spaceships and jet packs). Like, where's the fun in a plain piece of paper full of stupid numbers?Enter Dad, M.I.T. scholar John, who's a big fan of numbers. He finds Caleb's discovery rather fascinating, and, in fact, has uncovered something that no one else cares enough to believe. These numbers, when one looks close enough, each mean something significant. When properly sequenced, they foretell horrible disasters, past, present, and future. Life altering disasters!Knowing, IMHO, isn't as great as some popular critics have called it. It's, meh, ok. I'm not a critic, I'm just a fan who opines. I like the idea behind Knowing, but I think Nick Cage sort of overacts a wee bit. He's been guilty of it a few times in other movies, too. Maybe that's what he's going for here with his character, but it doesn't really work for me. There's no need to scream at everyone (sure, I get it, people just don't believe him when he predicts disasters). Also, I found the script a little predictable, and believe me the irony is not lost on me.One thing that is really cool in this film is the disasters we get to see. I must admit, even now, watching this film again 9-years later I find some of the CGI impressive. Sure, I did say 'wow' a few times, and not like a 'this is lame' kind of wow, either. It's good to watch once, then put it away for a few years and watch again. That's what I did, and now it's filed away - probably for another 9 years or so.",6,0,1,6 February 2018
U-571," The Sound Design is What Makes This Movie
","I remember seeing this in the theatre when it first came out. The sound design is what stood out the most, and still stands out today. I can 'listen' to this movie over and over again. The DVD version I saw recently has commentary by director Jonathan Mostow. In it he talks about the value of having theatre-style '6-channel surround format (at home) because it really replicates, as close as possible, the experience of seeing a movie in the theatre.' I like watching 'older' movies and listening to director commentary, especially when they get technical. Mostow, in his commentary, goes on to say how 'with the film to tape transfers now-a-days you can really extract a tremendous amount of visual information out of each frame.' (!) 'Film to tape.'Film, to tape, to glass master DVD, to DVD replication. Ah yes, the turn of the century technology a mere 17 years ago!Imagine, 17 years from now, we'll be mocking 4K UHD when we're sitting at home watching our favourite new-release film with some sort of organic-holographic-display-thing that looks so real it will seem like the actors are right in front of you and you can reach out and touch them; with sound so authentic you'd believe you were right there, with them, in the action. OK, maybe not 17 years, but perhaps 20.",7,0,1,28 November 2017
Dunkirk," Suspense-filled Thriller With Only 2,940 Spoken Words
","Dunkirk, in short: The story of when British, Belgium and French soldiers were trapped, surrounded, and all but abandoned by their government in a small French village. The call goes out to all civilian boats: bring our boys home.Dunkirk, in my words: Propaganda leaflets are dropped from the sky by the Nazi Luftwaffe. A British soldier picks up a few, with the intention of using them as toilet paper. The notice reads, 'We have you surrounded', then the bullets fly. So begins Christopher Nolan's latest film about the 'colossal military disaster' that became an inspiration to an already frightened population less than one year into WWII. The soldiers are ordered to retreat to the coast and await their ride home. Thousands of men standing-by on a beach in Dunkirk, France. They can nearly see home - across the English Channel - from where they are positioned, out in the open, 'like fish in a barrel' for the circling enemy planes. The Germans are closing in fast on their position. There is no fleet of battleships and frigates on the way to evacuate them, only a flotilla of patriotic civilians with their fishing boats and pleasure crafts; unarmed but fearless.Things you'll LIKE about Dunkirk: 1) It is awesome. When it starts, it doesn't stop until the credits role. The story moves very quickly and is seamless. The music is suspenseful, building, and intense and works to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the 106-minute running time. The aerial photography is nothing short of spectacular as it closely captures RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) during his mission. 2) There is very little spoken dialogue but there's a lot of action and the story is shown from three key perspectives. The script I read had 23 pages of dialogue. 2,940 spoken words to be exact (I counted them myself). The entire script has 15,325 words in total, including described action scenes and screen direction. It works, and it works well.Things you'll DISLIKE about Dunkirk: 1) This easily could have been a longer film, but it's not. As it is now, it's one of the shorter Christopher Nolan efforts at 106 minutes. Following (1998) is 69 minutes, Memento (2000) is 113 minutes. Dunkirk could have added another 15 minutes to the running time without changing the flow. 2) Guys, you may not like the One Direction dude (Harry Styles plays Alex) in this. However, you can take solace in knowing that he can act!",9,1,2,27 January 2018
Get Out," Told You So
","Get Out in short: An African-American man meets his white girlfriend's parents, and their friends, and notices that there's something a little strange going on.Racial undertones surround this really good horror-mystery film directed by a guy who has a (mostly) comedy background, Jordan Peele. Peele wades into deep waters filled with many horror greats swimming about. The question is, does he manage to stay afloat in this pool of great talent? Get Out is not without a little satire, but it's not the cheese comedy and clichÃ©s you sometimes see in bad horror films, it works here, it's smart. But it is a horror film, after all, and a damn good one too. So yes, Peele's floaties are working just fine.As a viewer, you instantly pick up the vibe going on right from the start. Director Jordan Peele, whose mother is white and father is black, sets the mood early and keeps reminding you of it. Chris, a black man, is dating a white woman, Rose. Nothing unusual about that, but for reasons that soon become clear, a big deal is made from it. Rose brings Chris home (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-esq) to an affluent neighborhood filled with old money and old white people who 'act as if they've never met a real black man before.' Suddenly, the geriatric's are referring to black stereo types, like, 'I'm a big fan of Tiger Woods,' or, 'Is it true what they say about black men in bed.' People are getting creepy, if not rude, looking him over - sizing him up almost like cattle at an auction. Chris' best friend, Rod the TSA worker (and proud of it) ominously warns, 'You don't go to a white girl's parent's house!' Even I began to feel sketched out!Two things you'll LIKE about Get Out: 1) The story is brilliant. Peele also wrote the script (2018 Oscar nominee for both Original Screenplay and Director). It's unique and unexpected. 2) It's the best horror film since The Shining (1980).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) You may be a little uncomfortable with the racial undertones at first, perhaps even embarrassed for your entire race (if you're white). Give the move a chance to make the point of it all. 2) It may be a few more years until you see a horror-mystery like this one again. Soak it up while you can.",8,21,41,27 January 2018
Call Me by Your Name," The World Is Still Not Ready For This But See It Anyway
","A great film with strong acting, directing, writing. Everything a movie needs to be great. One of the better LGBTQ-themed movies I've seen that can easily become more mainstream and less arthouse if more people were a little more open-minded.Other reviewers here are using strong words like 'Masterpiece' 'Classic' and 'Moving'. I'd certainly agree with all of them, but this movie isn't for everybody. Film lovers will adore it, others should pass.",8,1,5,8 January 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Tried To, But Failed
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 took a long time to get going. In the beginning of the movie I thought that Spider-Man was trying really hard to be that sarcastic, funny, wise-guy that Stan Lee realized, many years ago, Spider-Man was supposed to be. Certainly this franchise has come a long way since Toby Maguire's version of Spidey, but it still isn't quite there yet with Andrew Garfield playing the web-slinger.I didn't really get into this movie until it started looking, feeling, and sounding a lot more like a Marvel movie does today. Until that point, I was considering more like a 3 or 4, rather than the 6-stars I eventually gave it.I didn't see this film until 2017, so I think I was perhaps spoiled by the 'new' Spider-Man and a host of fantastic Marvel movies that followed The Amazing Spider-Man 2's release in 2014.If you're a fan of the 'Marvel Galaxy' of movies, see this. If not, then save it for a day when there is nothing else to watch.",6,0,0,5 January 2018
The Artist," The Film That Says A Lot By Staying Silent
","I'll be short and unusually sweet.I like the way this movie was made. I like it even more that others have not tried to replicate it since (so far). I'll keep my 'talkies' thank you very much.From a technical side, the 'full screen' aspect ratio didn't take too long to get used to, in part because the film itself didn't take too long to get into. The design of the picture, everything about it, brings you back and allows you to believe. That's the great thing about movies, they can carry you to a time and era you've never experienced just so you can experience it.I noticed right away how 'plain' the set decoration and lighting were back then. It would pain me to light a project like this because it's so simple and dull. The DP, Guillaume Schiffman, did do a fantastic job, and like the actors, had to learn a new technique to do his job I'm sure. It's so simple, it works on every level.About half way through I began to realize how difficult acting in a silent film really is. As an actor in a silent picture you have to work really hard at getting your point across to the audience in actions, and not words; 'mugging' as character Peppy Miller puts it. In saying that, the actors in this film would have had to train a little differently at being a silent film actor because all they've ever known are 'talkies' and their training as actors follow that basic necessity of today's movies - sound! In today's world, acting is more than just movement.The Oscar for Best Picture is well deserved. Although this isn't a movie I'll watch over and over, it was a nice switch.",8,2,5,14 November 2017
Les Misérables," A Butt-Numbing Epic In A Good Way
","Bare with me a moment. When I think Les MisÃ©rables, the first thing that comes to mind is not the classic epic 1862 novel by the great French writer Victor Hugo. Unfortunately, for me, I think of the '1% Club' in expensive suits and gowns out for an evening at the theatre watching moderately-paid stage actors with unconvincing accents perform a classic epic novel exclusively FOR the enjoyment of the '1% Club'. I mean, really, who in their right 99% mind would go to a stage show that takes place in the early 1800's OTHER than people with more dollars than sense? Let me clarify something, certainly past (and perhaps even present) stage productions of Les MisÃ©rables were probably not specifically geared toward the snobs of the world. In fact, the contrary may be true! Perhaps the novel was Mr. Hugo's way of 'sticking to the man', 19th century style (he was a 60-year-old former royalist-turned-republican when he wrote 'Les Mis' and later became a member of the French Senate)! But I digress.The '1% Club' comes to my mindÂ…or I should say CAME to mind whenever I heard about Les MisÃ©rables because, I'm willing to admit now, it was my ignorance of certain things I don't care about (I am a narcissistic idiot savant after all). I never read the book and I had no desire to. The stupid thing is over 1,400 pages! (1,900 in the original French version!) The KJV of the Bible only has 1,200 pages and it took me 40 years to get through that (and I'm still an ignorant blasphemer at times)! I did try to read Les MisÃ©rables about 7 years ago but my mental health issues would not allow me to get past chapter 5.Over the years I gathered from various sources what Les MisÃ©rables what all about: an ex-con named Jean Valjean (that's fun to say, isn't it?) trying to redeem himself but can't seem to escape his criminal past (which, by today's standards of good and evil isn't so bad â€“ he stole food for his sister's children!). Sure, sounds like a page-turner, I know, but I had better things to do. So, instead, I just deduced that the story was atypical of society today: a depressing struggle to live (am I far off?) and chose to pretend I was well-read and erudite when trying to fit in with the '1% Club'. Les MisÃ©rables, the novel, is so much more than that (I repeat, am I far off?). If you have the time, and apparently no life, I encourage you to read it. I, however, took the easy way out and watched the movie â€“ and it still took me until five years AFTER its release to see it (thank you Public Library!).This version of Les MisÃ©rables comes in at a butt-numbing 158 minutes. Unlike the theatre, or some of those epic films of the 1950's, there is no intermission which could allow time to use the washroom or check your Facebook (but there is a pause button thankfully). For someone with a short attention span like me, I didn't need to do that. There's enough action and violence to keep your butt in the seat, guys, and to be old fashioned in a non- misogynistic kind of way, for the women there's romance and familial bonds and love to keep you reaching for the tissues (even I enjoyed that part, too).I'm not a big fan of books-turned-musicals-turned-into-a-movie (I get the urge to sing everything I say), nevertheless this movie was not only enjoyable but also well made from a technical standpoint. Danny Cohen does a great job behind the lens (as is usually the case when he DP's a project). Cohen sometimes works with Production Designer Eve Stewart, and just like two of their past projects together - The King's Speech (2010), The Danish Girl (2015) - you can see that they do make a great tandem that helps bring this epic story to the screen. Skilled Director Tom Hooper unites the enormous cast and crew and even manages to get Russell Crowe to sing (!), all for a budget of less than $61 mil (USD). Not too bad, even a cynical 99%-er could appreciate the value of that.",8,1,2,30 October 2017
The Shape of Water," E.T. Meets Splash
","'The Shape of Water' in short: A mute woman has an unusual relationship with a strange creature captured in South America by the U.S. government.It's the height of the cold war, circa 1950's, and tensions between communist U.S.S.R. and the U.S. are nearly equal to that of the competition between the two in the Space Race. Elisa and Zelda are janitors working the overnight shift at a top-secret government facility housing an amphibious creature that may give the U.S. a distinct advantage over the Soviets. Elisa, who is mute and communicates through sign language, forms an instant bond with the creature, who has an affinity, it seems, for hard boiled eggs. Zelda is Elisa's good friend, co-worker, and translator. The creature, however, needs no translator. It's an intelligent being.Elisa spends her lunch hour in the lab communicating with the creature through sign. Witnessing these interactions is a scientist, Dr. Hoffstetler, charged with the creature's care. The man overseeing the entire secret government discovery is the creepy Richard Strickland, who reports to Five-Star General Hoyt. Strickland tries to convince his superior to mark the useless creature for death and dissection, a plan that doesn't sit well with Elisa and Hoffstetler. Hoyt has the power to make anyone disappear if he so chooses, a point that worries Strickland and influences his decisions later when all hell breaks loose.Think of this movie as a cross between an R-rated ET (1982) meets an R-rated Splash (1984).Two things you'll LIKE about 'The Shape of Water': 1) It's hard to choose just two. The 13-Oscar nominations are well deserved. Everything flows nicely. Well-acted, designed, edited, directed, scripted, the list goes on. 2) Character actor Richard Jenkins (who is Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor) plays Giles, a former alcoholic, current homosexual, down-on-his-luck advertising-agency-artist (whew) and is Elisa's friend and neighbor. He's awesome in this role and has one of the best line's in the movie (I won't spoil it).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) If you're not a fan of Guillermo del Toro's unique style of film making, you will not like this movie. I am neither a fan nor a hater, but I still enjoyed the movie either way. 2) The subject matter. It's, uhm, odd (keep an open mind).",8,9,15,25 January 2018
Steve Jobs," Jerk. Brilliant. Narcissistic. Visionary.
","Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, in reference to this movie, was once quoted as saying, '(Steve Jobs) is not a photograph it's a painting.'After reading the book and then recently seeing the movie, I would agree. Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of Steve Jobs is a favorite of mine and the movie is pretty good, but no where near as detailed.The movie is not really 'Steve Jobs'; he was so much more than the asshole portrayed in the movie. Yes, true (as Isaacson's bluntly objective book confirms) Jobs was a massive jerk; a sometimes mean, vicious, sarcastic person who believed he was God's gift to computers, and a ruthless businessman. He wasn't a code-writer or an engineer. He was a visionary. He knew what we wanted before we wanted it. His mind was years ahead of technology. Kurt Cobain changed the face of music; Steve Jobs changed the face of computing forever (I don't own a single iThing) and he did it his way.Writer Sorkin did an excellent job adapting Isaacson's book for the screen, doing it in three acts that coincide with three of Jobs' biggest business 'accomplishments': The introduction of the Macintosh (1984), NeXT (1988), and the iMac (1998). (The NeXT was a disaster. A $13,000 - in today's dollars - perfectly square useless brick. But, fun-fact, the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, used a NeXTcube to run the world's first webserver!). There was so much to Jobs' life and so many more people in his life detailed in the book, that it must have been a difficult adaptation for Sorkin. However, the point was taken – Jobs was a brilliant, albeit flawed person.It's fun to watch the movie, and it's faced-paced so you won't be looking for the 'NeXT' scene button. Take it for what it is, a subjective portrait.",9,0,0,4 December 2017
Mudbound," Friendship Bound In Mud
","Mudbound, in short, is the story of two men, strangers from the same small Mississippi town, who return from WWII and find that things haven't changed much since they left.Still interested? Read on. Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) is black, and a former Army sergeant who fought under General Patton on the front lines. Ronsel was respected, not only by his fellow soldiers but by the various communities in Europe he helped liberate. Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) is white, and a former captain in the Air Force who flew bombing missions over Germany. He too was respected by nearly everyone, but his own Pappy (Jonathan Banks), your typical racist, crusty old man.Post war, Ronsel and Jamie return to a poor, muddy community they called home prior to WWII. Ronsel goes back to living with his mid-wife mother, Florence (Mary J. Blige), his father, Hap (Rob Morgan), and his brothers and sisters. Hap farms the land he lives on, and rents from, Jamie's brother, Henry (Jason Clarke). Jamie moves in with his brother Henry, his wife Laura (Carey Mulligan) and the racist old b****r, Pappy.Ronsel and Jamie, though strangers before and during the war, eventually meet (as strangers in a small town usually do) and bond over their mutual military background. Raised by a racist father, Jamie is anything but and is willing to risk breaking rules and laws to protect his new friend Ronsel. As the two men soon find out, war heroes or not, their friendship is not welcome in 1945 Mississippi.Mudbound, IMHO, is about a lot more than just what I wrote above but I really don't want to rehash everything everyone has already said. I'm not a critic, I'm just a fan of movies. I like that it is told from the perspective of more than one person. I like that the oppressed fight back. I like that I felt anger, happiness and sadness in all the right places, that's what a good movie is supposed to do to the viewer. I like that it's not predictable, even up to the very end I was surprised.I like the cinematography. It's beautifully shot, something that's quite difficult when one's set is hatred, poverty and despair. I like that Rachel Morrison is responsible for that and she's being recognized by an Academy that has always ignored female DP's. I like the script (based on a novel), and the directing. This movie is watchable more than once.",8,1,6,6 February 2018
12 Strong," Good But Could Have Been Better
","In short: '12 Strong' is based on the book 'Horse Soldiers' by Doug Stanton. In the weeks following 9/11 an elite squad of soldiers from the Army's Fifth Special Forces Group were flown into Afghanistan and dropped behind enemy lines. Their mission: work with a local, CIA-paid warlord, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, and his 'Northern Alliance forces', defeat the Taliban, and secure the strategic city of Mazar-i-Sharif.Whoopsy, no one told this group of '12 Strong' American badasses, led by Captain Mitch Nelson (Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth), that the fight will have to be done on horseback. Oh, and 'you have six-weeks to do it.' Says Thor: 'We'll do it in three.'If you're expecting an action-packed two-hours, you'll be disappointed. When the action does eventually start, it moves quickly from location to location with carpet-bombing-B-52's doing most of the heavy-lifting. Sure, it's fun to watch American air-superiority blow the shit out of the Taliban, but I paid to see Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Peña and Trevante Rhodes (Moonlight) gallop and shoot their way to glory. But, this is a true story and the truth can be anti climactic sometimes.Two things you'll LIKE about '12 Strong': 1) Although the action scenes are short, they are awesomely intense and loud. 2) This is a guy movie. There isn't much in the way of romance, only bromance (if you're female, well, there is Chris Hemsworth but you may as well stay at home with the book version and a bottle of Chardonnay).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) There's a lot of reading to do. It seems like every five-minutes the team is going from Taliban stronghold to stronghold and apparently we need to know exactly who is who and where they are, in white bold, CAPS-LOCKED titles on the screen. 2) There's no emotion, and very little chemistry between the characters.",5,21,56,18 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Better Than Most Kong Remakes
","Any movie, or anything, really, that keeps my attention is good. Although I didn't really like the orange tinge everything seems to have in the very beginning, the technical side improves dramatically as the film progresses.It takes place in 1973, just after the Americans 'abandoned' the Vietnam War (according to Samuel L Jackson's Preston Packard character). The 70's production design is good and brings me back to my childhood (the soundtrack was awesome with plenty of 70's hits), although you don't see much of the 70's vibe after the first 20 minutes or so. The CGI is very good and doesn't make me feel like I'm playing a video game. This movie is like Jurassic Park meets Godzilla and they had a baby called Platoon and it grew to become a mash-up of the three of them with its own uniqueness called Kong: Skull Island.Just under two hours in length and 'hold onto your butts' and watch the credits.My favourite quote from the movie is, 'A camera is more dangerous than a gun.' Seems like SLJ get's all the good lines.",7,63,107,5 November 2017
Blade Runner," Blade Runner CGI Is Still Relevant
","Blade Runner, in short, is a futuristic tale about a guy (Harrison Ford) who goes after some rogue pseudo-humans, called replicants, who killed a bunch of people, stole a spaceship, and returned to Earth to find their creator.Blade Runner, IMHO, has been reviewed ad nauseum since its release in 1982 so there isn't much more I can add to it. I will say, however, that despite this movie's advanced age, I only just recently screened it. So, since I missed the timing boat for reviewing, I'll quickly comment on the film's CGI (Computer Generated Imagery).I consider myself a little bit of a nerd but I'm not really into the sci-fi genre like many-a-nerd - I enjoy sci-fi as much as any genre; I am a fan of all movies in general. I have seen countless films where CGI is an important part of the story telling, science fiction or not. Seeing Blade Runner less than 36 hours after binge-racing Altered Carbon (2018), the big-budget Netflix series that has been compared to Blade Runner, I noticed the 35-year-old CGI to be (still) quite impressive!The scenery, the futuristic look and feel, of Blade Runner and Altered Carbon is nearly identical in its presentation (the same can be said for Ghost in the Shell with Scarlett Johansson and, yes, even the new Blade Runner). The only real noticeable differences are the overall length of each scene containing CGI, and its attention to detail (like more flashing lights and moving objects in the background). The reasoning behind this, one can presume, is overall cost and technology advancement. I remember in the early 1990's the price tag for basic CGI ran around $1000 per second of rendered video. I can imagine that in 1982 the cost was even more stupid, thus limiting the amount of time CGI could be used (add to that the cost of optical effects-like credits and other on-screen writing- and you're looking at a hefty bill).Blade Runner's budget was $28 million in 1982. Based on an annual inflation rate of 2.64% per year, that budget would be something like $71.5 million now, or about $80 million less than the budget for Blade Runner 2049 ($150 million - coincidentally rumored to be Altered Carbon's 10-episode budget). Fast-forward to 2017 and pretty much anyone with a $600 laptop and the right software can create similar CGI if they have the time to invest in modeling and rendering. Can you imagine what Blade Runner would look like with today's CGI? Well, look no further than Blade Runner 2049. I must point out a little irony in that the Blade Runner from 1982 takes place in the futuristic 2019.My point is, Blade Runner, from a technical stand-point, impressed me as much as Altered Carbon and Blade Runner 2049. Everything is relative, of course. So, one would expect somewhat more of a wow factor out of a new sci-fi release than one that may be older than themselves. Blade Runner (1982) CGI can still hold its own. I can vaguely remember when Blade Runner was first released the talk of Hollywood was the 'special effects', as it was generally known back then. The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards ®: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Effects, Visual Effects. Today that's called Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects - two of Blade Runner 2049's five Oscar nominations this year.",8,0,0,4 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Great 'First Movie Experience for Any Kid.
","I can remember this being the first movie I ever saw in a theater. I remember asking my mom 'Is it still light outside' so many times. I couldn't quite get the fact that it can be dark in a room and still daylight hours! Ah, if life were only that simple now.This movie is a great way to get any child into loving motion pictures! Fun. Simple. 40 years later I can watch this movie over and over again and it will still keep my attention...even in a dark room in the middle of the day! You don't have to be a science fiction nerd to enjoy. Just...enjoy. With or without your young ones.",9,0,0,25 December 2017
Moon," One Of Rockwell's Best Performances
","Moon, in short, tells us the story of astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who, along with his HAL-like computer friend GERTY (Kevin Spacey), is harvesting the moon's natural resources to help Earth's dwindling power supply. Sam has a three-year contract that is weeks away from ending and his replacement will soon arrive. Obviously, he's starting to get a little excited about going home, who wouldn't be, right? Especially since he's a father now; his wife, Tess (Dominique McElligott - to whom he can only communicate via a one-way recorded message), gave birth to their only child, a daughter, while he was at work, plus the isolation is clearly getting to him. It seems like the perfect time to high-tail it out of there. Almost too perfect, something is a little...off. Certainly, GERTY is good company, for a computer who can only display emotion by way of a small screen and creepy emojis, but, pardon the clichÃ©, as the day for his leaving approaches, he has a really close-encounter that is far more entertaining. And life altering.Moon, IMHO, when I first saw this movie in 2009 I loved it. I just saw it again, and I still love it. Even though it is quite obscure, and still not well promoted, it is a perfect independent film made with a minuscule $5 million budget. I knew as much about it in 2009 before I screened it the first time, as you may know right now. It's really all you need to know about the plot, any more and there'd be spoilers. Moon is one of Sam Rockwell's best films and best performances. It's not packed with explosions, gun fights and other distractions; none of that is needed here. It's good acting, good direction, and a good script.",9,0,1,6 February 2018
