The Longest Yard," Good, but too much by the numbers......
","For football and Sandler fans, this will be a good tide over in between your fix of watching real games. As a film, this is strictly a by the numbers recycle of the older, better, 1974 film. Most of the same story elements are here, as well as dialog lifted straight from the original script. We get some updated dialog to make it entertaining (mainly Rock's quips), but I wish they had tried something a little different with it rather than taken the lazy way out.In the end though, a good rental for the football fans out there. Possibly a purchase for Sandler fans, though this is by far not his best film. None the less, harmless fun not to be taken seriously.",6,0,0,23 September 2005
Oldboy," A mess
","OK, perhaps there is truth in the saying 'lost in translation' because I absolutely do not understand why this movie has garnered the praise it has. It is a mess, an absolute mess from beginning to end. The only positive thing I can say about it is the wickedly twisted revenge plot. There is no cohesive story line, no attempt to give the viewer any kind of clue about what is going on. You are kept in the dark the whole time, which I assume is the point. But by the time the final credits roll, you want to borrow one of the hammers used in the movie and beat yourself over the head with it to stop the pain that the film inflicts on your senses from trying to make any kind of sense of it.I have since gone back and watched this film again without the dubbed soundtrack and though I still feel it is way over hyped, I do not feel it is as bad as my initial review of it above. I have given it another star from my original 4 that I gave it. Still, the movie",5,129,284,27 August 2005
Lost in Translation," Art of subtle acting.....
","I resisted watching this movie for the longest time. I really wasn't interested in it quite frankly. But over time, finally just gave in the other night when it showed up on TMC. I was totally blown away. Bill Murray has turned into one hell of an actor. The movie is an example of subtle film making at its best. There is really nothing exciting to keep you into the movie. What keeps you into the movie is the performances of Murray and Johansson. Watching these two Americans in Japan, neither doing what they want to be doing but powerless it would seem to change that. Both are not totally happy in their current relationships. These two factors bring them together, an unlikely pair, but given their circumstances, the relationship makes perfect sense. I am glad that I finally gave in and gave this movie a chance. After seeing some dismal movies lately, was nice to watch something that lived up to the hype I had heard.",9,4,8,18 September 2005
Corpse Bride," Not bad.....but not great
","I have to admit, I came out of Corpse Bride a bit disappointed. It wasn't because the film was bad. It is because it didn't equal or surpass Nightmare Before Christmas.The film effectively evokes the Burton sense of style and story telling. But something is not quite right. The songs are one thing. Elfman, a great composer and long-time collaborator, seems to just kind of sleep walk through this one. Nothing really catchy in the way of songs, which was a big part of Nightmare. The other thing, the story just kind of left the whole sub-plot of the bride and the duke. There really was no real acknowledgment of their past.All in all, will be added to my collection, but can't help but feel this was a bit rushed.",7,0,0,12 October 2005
The Village," Movie suffers from inaccurate marketing......
","As with M.Night's other movies, I enjoyed this latest outing, especially the performances of the leads. I think the movie suffered in overall response due to a poorly conceived marketing plan.The movie was sold as a horror film and fans of that genre went into this with that mindset in place. When the film actually turned out to be a look at how we try and protect those we love from the horrors of the 'real world', fans were upset and rightly so. As anyone that has enjoyed M.Night's movies, all is not what it would seem. I think the marketing pushed too hard the horror aspect which created an expectation that was not going to be met.I think if you go into this movie expecting another commentary on spiritual and moral themes, you are going to like this. If you are going into this for the scare factor, you are going to be left empty.",7,13,17,24 October 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not the 70's version........and that is a good thing
","I grew up with the 70's version of this famous book. I loved and still love watching the movie to this day. Though I own it on DVD, any time it is on TV, I stop and watch it.When I learned Burton was teaming with Depp to make a new one, I knew that it would be a 'new' version. I was not disappointed.I have seen many make references to Depp's characterization of Wonka as being a spin on Michael Jackson. I say that comparison is grossly inaccurate. I felt Depp presented a Wonka who was a lonely, tortured soul, out of touch with the real world. Perhaps it is this that many are drawn to in their connection of Depp's Wonka being a send up of Jackson, but I disagree whole heartedly and say Depp gave us the Wonka that was intended in the book. This man is not going to be the fatherly type. He is going to be eccentric and goofy as well as creepy and dark. All of these are on display in Depp's performance.Excellent work. I still love the 70's version and it remains a classic story from my youth. But this version has staked it's own unique place.",8,0,2,14 November 2005
