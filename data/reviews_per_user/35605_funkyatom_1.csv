Raiders of the Lost Ark," As Good as Bergman... anyday!
","I've never understood the point of dissing mainstream Hollywood Movies by comparing them to arthouse movies.  And I've certainly never understood why the points of comparison have to be so frequently ludicrous: to say that Hollywood is artistically bankrupt by comparing Batman and Robin to The Seventh Seal or Le Regle de Jeu... doh!  The issue at stake here is rooted in the question of why we watch movies: art? entertainment?What I'm trying to say is that, on it's own merits, I'd put Raiders of the Lost Ark up against three hours of rain-soaked streets, blank b/w expressions and lingering half-truths any day!",10,0,1,9 December 2000
