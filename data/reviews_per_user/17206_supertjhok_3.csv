Requiem for a Dream," A harrowing descent into the abyss
","Don't see this movie unless you're prepared to come out feeling completely drained emotionally. Darren Aronofsky's modern day morality tale of the doomed life of four individuals from Brooklyn hits the viewer hard. Really hard. superb acting helps - Ellen Burstyn, Marlon Wyans, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are all great. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well. If you connect with any of the characters, be prepared for a gut wrenching ride. A superb score and beautiful cinematography only strengthen the movie's grip. I literally could not take my eyes of the screen. That's not to say that I liked what I was seeing there - the spectacle of four people destroying themselves is unpleasant and deeply disturbing. But it's unforgettable. In conclusion: watch this movie. But only if you're sure you can stand it.",10,0,0,30 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," a VERY satisfying film...
","the second part in the trilogy picks up from where the first left off, and i liked peter jackson's decision not to include any sort of retrospective of the fellowship of the ring. it wouldn't have felt right, and who didn't see the first movie anyway? that having been said, the movie does do a wonderful job of translating tolkien's novel to the screen, with some largely excusable (forgive me, lotr purists) alterations. cinematically, it largely works, though the relentless pace can get a little confusing. but the director had the difficult task in this movie of fusing together three independent storylines, and he manages it pretty successfully in the end. the casting was inspired. the actors all get into their characters and are really fun to watch, especially, of course, the one who doesn't appear on screen at all - andy serkis, who was digitized into the creature gollum on screen, turns in a simply remarkable performance as the schizophrenic gollum. the scenery and backgrounds are stunning, the battle scenes are choreographed to perfection, and above all, the movie manages to capture the essence (and not every nuance, but i'm sure the author would have understood) of the lord of the rings. the timeless struggle between good and evil, light and dark, free will and slavery, it's all there, larger than life. this is a movie that will remain with you for a long, long time. go ahead and watch it in theaters while you still can.",10,0,0,25 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A terrific piece of film making
","This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Clocking in at a hefty 200 minutes, The Return of the King never feels unduly long. It's packed with memorable scenes, snappy screen writing and some great acting. It provides a fitting conclusion to the LOTR trilogy. As a fan of the books, I was disappointed that some of my favorite sections had to be left out of the movie, for example the scouring of the Shire. But that should not detract from the fact that this is a stupendous, epic movie that captures the spirit of Tolkien's creation and just demands to be viewed on the big screen. Some things stand out even against the general excellence of the film - the character of Gollum, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Sean Astin as Sam. But enough talking! If you haven't seen the movie yet, go ahead and see it. It's an experience not to be missed. This is why we like going to the movies.",Null,0,1,17 December 2003
