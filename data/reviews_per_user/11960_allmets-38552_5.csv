Casablanca," They don't make movies like this anymore, folks
","This film really is nearly perfect. The acting, the witty script, the political intrigue, the romance, even the music. This really is what film is all about!",10,3,4,23 November 2019
The Shining," What can I say that hasn't already been said?
","The funny thing about this film is that (due to the performances, set design, and brilliant direction) you'll probably like it, not love it, the first time you see it. Then the second and third time might drag. But around the 4th or 5th time you see it, you'll appreciate it in a way you hadn't before!",10,2,2,23 November 2019
Life Is Beautiful," This might be my favorite film
","This is a deeply moving and funny portrayal of a clever father's bottomless love for his son, during one the most horrific times in history.It is overblown to say that he doesn't respect the seriousness of the subject matter, he does, it just isn't the point of the film. The point of the film is the psychological journey of a man, who has always been able to scheme his way out of anything, trying to shield his son from brutal reality as they both find themselves in a Nazi Concentration Camp.",10,2,2,23 November 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," Great Characters
",What differentiates this film from the hundreds of poor homages that came after it is the care and time it takes to build genuinely interesting and nuanced characters.,9,0,0,24 November 2019
Marriage Story," Moral- Don't Let the Little Stuff Ruin the Big Stuff
","This movie is so well acted that you can't help but feel a pit in your stomach as 2 people, who seem to still love each other, hurt each other over and over again.The bulk of the hurt coming from Charlie occurred prior to the story being told, so he comes off as significantly more sympathetic. It's difficult for Nicole's character to be as sympathetic because we witness the ways she is able to hurt Charlie, and only hear about how Charlie has hurt her in the past. In one culminating outburst, he declares that only being unfaithful to her once was a favor because of how popular he was and how many times he wanted to be unfaithful to her. Still, this outburst comes after his child has been taken away from him, his money is being systematically drained, and his entire career is collapsing- and even then he immediately apologizes for saying it.They both seem to really like each other, and both claim the other is a good parent, but still they find themselves in a courtroom with lawyers making them each sound like neglectful monsters.There is a final scene in which Charlie and his son are reading together and Nicole is standing outside the door, and it really crystallizes how great a family they could've been if they could've just been a little less selfish about the little stuff like who gets credit for what and what city they should live in. That scene made me tear up. The moral of the story is, don't let the little stuff ruin the big stuff- which is clearly what these 2 have done.",9,11,17,18 December 2019
