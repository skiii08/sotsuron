The Devil's Advocate," Pacino is always great
","Anyone that likes Pacino must see this one, and you can't watch it just once.  You will pick up on much more the second time.  I don't think there is another actor that could have played the part any better.",8,0,1,30 November 1998
Good Will Hunting," Couldn't miss a minute!
",This is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.  The movie holds your attention the entire time.  It also shows that good guys don't have to finish last.  The only problem I see is that the language could have been cleaned up.  I don't understand why that can't be left out of great movies so everyone can enjoy them.,9,0,1,14 December 1998
Men in Black," Better than I expected
","I'm not a big sci-fi fan, so I didn't expect this to be a very good movie. Overall, it was pretty funny.  Without Tommy Lee Jones it probably wouldn't have been as good.",8,1,1,1 December 1998
