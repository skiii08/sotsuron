Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars, what do you expect?
","Ok, I have inadvertently seen this movie twice, and while it's definitely not a great film, it is thoroughly entertaining.  More so the first time, though.  The second time through I was just waiting for Darth Maul to show up.  Ok, the disappointing stuff first: the script was simplistic, and therefore the acting was moderate.  There were some great or at least very good actors in this movie (Liam Neeson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan MacGregor, etc.) but here they just weren't given much to do.  I understand the argument that these are meant to be archetypal characters and all, but it nevertheless got on my nerves.  And Jake Lloyd has got to go.  He got very annoying over time.  Did we really need all those 'Yippee!!'s?  Also, I predictably hated Jar Jar and, for that matter, did not like the Gunguns much at all.  Also, George Lucas' direction style seems to be gradually moving toward a very young audience with very short attention spans.  That said, here's what I did like: Darth Maul (hey, I have a thing for villains, what can I say?)--the dueling scene was in my opinion the best scene in the entire movie, and to quote EW magazine, DM made Vader look like Mary Poppins.  Also the computer graphics were obviously amazing--Naboo is absolutely beautiful.  I liked the battle droids and the 'futuristic hedgehog' rolling droids (Forgive me, I don't know the proper names)  All in all, I am not a Star Wars junkie as some of my friends are, and I am therefore not a purist as far as these movies go.  I enjoy the first trilogy, but I don't find those movies to be terribly good either. Therefore, I went into Phantom Menace expecting not a great film, but pure, sometimes mindless entertainment as has been the tradition in Star Wars. If you go in with this expectation you won't be disappointed.  Two final thoughts:  Phantom Menace was sorely lacking the charismatic character Harrison Ford previously provided, and I would've liked it a whole lot more if they hadn't killed off the two best characters.",Null,0,0,23 June 1999
Se7en," Some scenes are worth seeing
","What can I say?  I can see why this movie was recommended to me after I admitted that 'Silence of the Lambs' was one of my favorite movies. 'Seven' features an interesting premise (an intelligent serial killer chooses his victims according to the seven deadly sins) and some pretty cool, very dark plot twists.  However, in my mind there is no comparison between 'Seven' and 'Silence,' and most of this judgment comes from the acting ability (or lack thereof) displayed.  Kevin Spacey is the only worthy actor in the bunch, and his performance is great.  Though I've seen Morgan Freeman in better roles -- he doesn't do much here.  Gwyneth was fine, but nothing special -- she was better in 'Shakespeare in Love.'  And finally, at the risk of being attacked, I would just like to say that Brad Pitt does not have much acting ability, and it is painfully obvious here.  His forced whining and yelling *almost* spoiled the last scene for me.  I say *almost* because I find the entire last part of the movie (the part with Kevin Spacey, incidentally) very well-written and worth seeing.  Spacey's character, 'John Doe,' is extremely creepy and his lines are well-written and even funny at times. He is everyone's worst nightmare vision of a serial killer -- insane and dangerous, yet rational and calculating.  Spacey's voice is exactly right for the part -- it gave me chills.  Other than the last scene (the car, the desert), the movie is gruesome, often too dark, and badly acted.  The concept is a good one, however, and it is done justice.  Check out the way the 'pride' victim is set up -- it's genius.  If you're a fan of Kevin Spacey, you won't be dissatisfied by the end of the movie.  He's basically why I saw it.  Caution, though : Brad needs SERIOUS acting lessons.  Or maybe he's had too many -- everything he does here seems forced",Null,0,0,30 June 1999
American Beauty," A beautiful movie
","I saw a sneak preview of American Beauty recently and all I can say is that I intend to see it again.  This is a WONDERFUL movie that is worth the money to see in the theaters (the only movie I've been to where half the audience broke into applause during the film).  Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man who, while going through a mid-life crisis, begins to lust after a teenage friend of his daughter's.  Spacey is, of course, a fabulous actor and really shines in this role.  There are a few interwoven story lines involving Spacey's relationship with his control freak wife (Annette Bening, who is good if a little bit over the top in this role) and daughter, and the family next door, which includes a military general father, a mother who is apparently clinically depressed, and a very interesting son who is obsessed with filming beautiful things (including Lester's daughter Jane).  What is unusual about this movie is that the plot is not unusual or particularly unique--it's a couple of families in an anonymous American suburb and how they relate--but the filming of the movie is absolutely beautiful, and is done in a way that makes the film alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, and horrific.  It is definitely for mature audiences--there is some violence and a couple of frontal nudity scenes (both of which are essential and very tastefully done)--but older teens might enjoy it as well.  Be wary of how the media chooses to portray this movie--it may be called a 'black comedy,' but, while sometimes hilarious, it is definitely a drama.  Go see it--I don't think you'll be sorry.",10,3,4,13 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," A brilliant movie
","Yes, this movie is full of obscenities and violence.  Yes, it does have a confusing plot (I'm still not sure I've got it all, after 5 viewings). However.  The acting performances given by all of the Usual Suspects are amazing (especially Kevin Spacey, aka Verbal, 'the gimp,' etc.), and Bryan Singer outdoes himself in his wonderful direction, artistic and gripping at the same time.  The writing gets better with every viewing--some truly classic one-liners and realistic dialogue as well.  But what keeps me watching this movie is the ending.  I won't spoil it, but those of you who have seen the film know what I'm talking about.  One of my favorite movie endings EVER (especially the last, split-second camera shot, the last two words spoken, and the cello chord at the very end).  The ending makes repeat viewings almost necessary.  For me, the second viewing was better than the first, because you realize what great acting and dialogue adds to the movie. See it a couple times--you won't be sorry.",Null,0,1,17 June 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Bloody but clever
","After seeing Reservoir Dogs last night, I have come to the conclusion that it is probably one of the best debut films I've seen.  Tarantino's first movie does not equal the later Pulp Fiction, but it is very cleverly done. Yes, there is a lot of blood and gratuitous violence, perhaps too much. Tarantino does have an ear for clever dialogue, though, when it is not limited to people shouting obscenities.  Several scenes in Reservoir Dogs are brutally funny, not because of the action but because of the writing. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth (Mr. White and Mr. Orange) are both great actors and their scenes together are good if painful to watch.  Mr. Blonde (Mark? Madsen, also  great) scared me more than any flashy horror-movie villain ever has--the entire scene with the unfortunate police officer is very well-done and also VERY hard to watch.  In essence, the movie is well-acted and mostly well-scripted.  If you like Pulp Fiction you'll most likely enjoy (maybe that's not the right word) Reservoir Dogs.  All the cinematic scenes of Pulp Fiction are right there--the camera angles from the trunk, people being shot in the backseats of cars, clever dialogue in seedy restaurants, etc. An interesting ride of a movie.",Null,0,1,17 June 1999
Rosemary's Baby," truly, truly creepy
","This movie truly frightened me.  What was so interesting about it, though, was that the true horror of the movie (disregarding the ending, which I simply could not watch the first time) is totally understated, yet there the whole time.  The horror comes with the audience knowing what's happening, what really is going on with the neighbors and with Rosemary's demise, and not being able to do a thing about it.  In its own way, this movie is incredibly tense and nerve-racking.  It's the ultimate last word in 'I have a bad feeling about this' movies.  Roman Polanski is great at creating that underlying horror -- I can't even THINK about the opening and closing music without a shiver.  The music in general was effective, and the direction, especially the 'dream' sequence, was dark and very Polanski-esque.  The acting was good, understated, exactly what the movie called for.  So much scarier than any of the teen 'horror' movies out lately.",Null,0,1,30 June 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A dramatic story in the style of MTV
","I'm not a 'Dracula' purist, I don't really know the way the story is *supposed* to be told, but my guess is that 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' would not satisfy those people who do care about such things.  I think that Francis Ford Coppola has probably left his golden years (The Godfather, etc) behind forever -- he directs this movie as though it were some sort of an MTV music video.  My two main acting (or perhaps casting) gripes are probably with Keanu Reeves and Gary Oldman.  Keanu is his usual deadpan self -- it was to be expected, but I would've liked to see a bit more depth brought to the role.  And Oldman as the Count -- what can I say, he just didn't develop that sense of combined elegance and dread I associate with the character.  Winona Ryder surprised me by being quite fitting in the role of Mina -- also her 'possession' scene is quite well done and probably the creepiest scene in the movie.  Anthony Hopkins is great and over-the-top at the same time, but I think it's what Van Helsing's character requires.  He is dramatic and funny at the same time, and is always a joy to watch ('An autopsy?  Oh no, nothing like that, I just want to cut off her head and take out her heart.').  His scene with Jonathan and Mina at the dinner table is quite funny as well. The movie is frequently beautiful to watch, visually, but Coppola directs as if his audience has a  very short attention span. This got on my nerves after a while.  It is, however, a very entertaining movie, which is all I really expected it to be.",Null,0,0,25 June 1999
The Matrix," plot/character-challenged, visually wonderful
","After it seemed like everyone else around me had seen The Matrix, seen it again, loved it and ranted endlessly about it, I finally went and saw it! And let's just say this: it is not a GOOD movie, but it is extremely entertaining and worth seeing in the theaters (it's not worth seeing at home, in my opinion).  Obviously, The Matrix is beautiful and stunning (kung fu sequence, anyone?) but it is also quite confusing in spots and boring in others (little squid-like things keep attacking their ship in what turns out to be an almost totally unnecessary subplot).  The acting is lacking but sufficient, and the writing was, in my view, disappointing.  There were a number of scenes that would have been PERFECT had the characters (or writers, as the case may be) had the sense to say the right thing.  There were a number of scenes I DID like :the scene comparing humans to a disease, the first meeting between Neo and Morpheus,  the building jump (the requisite Keanu Reeves 'whoa' moment) and the ending scenes.  The visual effects are the real star of the show, and they're worth paying the theater price to see.  So, basically, it's never going to be a classic (well, maybe at cult status) but The Matrix is a very entertaining, beautiful ride.",Null,0,0,26 May 1999
