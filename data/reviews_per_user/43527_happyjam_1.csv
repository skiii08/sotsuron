Hereditary," Just Awful.
","This film was so bad - just awful and dull. Yeah I 'get it' it's not your average slasher or horror film, but dear lord the film is so meh. The acting is ok with the exception of 'Joan' (Ann Dowd) who's VERY annoying, over the top 'handsy' delivery is beyond annoying. I was half expecting Toni Collette to slap her and scream 'Stop frigging TOUCHING ME!!!' Alex Wolff is fine as Peter, but his ending (spoiler) as he is possessed by what ever spirit is so dull and blandly presented, he looks like he could be looking at the menu at cracker barrel instead of a demon finally brought back to life. Toni Collette is good (spoiler) apart from a ridiculous, and laughable, ceiling spider crawl not to mention her pointless wtf death. Gabriel Byrne is absent only providing some familial tension hilariously popping up as the stick concerned husband/ father. All in all a waste of time. Nothing 'psychological', 'cranking up the tension', or 'thrilling' here. Just a pointless, semi-pretentious yawn fest.",1,2,8,4 January 2020
