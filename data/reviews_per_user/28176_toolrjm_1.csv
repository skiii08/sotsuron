The Ring," Awesome Scary Movie, much better than the Japanese version
","I love the comments about 'ignorant Americans'.  Very tasteful.  So I went and downloaded the original Ringu (Japanese version).  I mean, I could kinda see why people might think it's a scary movie, but it was really about as scary as Toy Story.  Granted, there were no special effects, but there were no special anythings.  The plot was worse, the suspense wasn't there.  I did think that the American version of the Ring was one of the truly scary movies out there.  Horrifying AND suspenseful, and not the traditional 'American' ending.  Very good movie.  But if you must, you can compare it to the Japanese version.  But i think you'll find my comparison pretty accurate.",Null,0,0,20 December 2002
