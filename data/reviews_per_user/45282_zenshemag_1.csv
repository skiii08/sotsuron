The Equalizer," Equalizer
","Superb movie! However, I could not understand the dialogue between the woman (CIA??FBI?? Secret Service??) sitting on the porch with Denzel visited (from his past). Her dialogue was vaguely about 'giving him permission' to resume his 'equalizer' tasks, just one more time or 'its okay to 'equalize' since that portion of the promise was delivered to this deceased wife without wholeness. anyway, if someone could send me the dialogue between the two, I would appreciate it very much.I especially thought that the most critical scene occurred in the Home Depot location wherein Robert ingeniously never used a gun to defeat his enemy. Additionally, I applaud the security guard for his unselfish assistance in 'never leaving anyone behind' even though, he seemed to be mentally injured.",10,4,20,25 September 2014
