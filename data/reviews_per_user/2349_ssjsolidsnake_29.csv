Alien 3," Alien with some British flavour
","The story is funky especially with the way it starts as a sequel but it's still a good alien movie.
Ripley in the middle of British accents is a fun one.
Some CGI effects are little poor but otherwise the stage they built for this movie is awesome.
David Fincher's directing is top notch, the pacing is perfect.",7,0,0,21 October 2019
Requiem for a Dream," Don't do drugs kids
","This is a good movie to show as drug prevention, it's really shocking and you will think about it for days after seeing it. Great work by Darren",9,0,0,21 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too much hate
","This movie is really awesome, saw it first time when I was a kid and was jaw dropping at every visuals, Naboo is so good. And the Pod race, omg. The POD RACE. The sound FX are from another planet they really did a good job at making those!Ok some elements might feel like a B movie but it starts the story very well if you care about the Star Wars story and you got Liam Neeson being the coolest wisdom guy ever and Ewan nailing the role of Obi Wan like it was made for him.
It also has the best light saber fight of all movies.
Jar Jar Binks is a special character and you should pay close attention to him.This movie is great and is very easy to rewatch multiple times.",8,4,5,21 October 2019
It," Not scary but fun
","This movie isn't scary at all as it feels like nobody is ever in danger it's a bit confusing but otherwise it's a fun adventure movie with kids, also liked the bad kids they were pretty realistic and they felt like a real threat.",7,0,0,5 November 2019
Hereditary," Nice scary movie
","Decent movie, the story is a bit sad, the scary parts were alright, didn't like the ending and the explanation much, some gory bits but nothing too shabby, otherwise an enjoyable fun film",7,0,1,5 November 2019
Train to Busan," Good zombie flick
","This is a nice zombie flick on a train, some elements were a bit cheesy but overall it's a nice zombie movie from Korea that all zombie fans genre should watch",7,0,1,6 November 2019
Inglourious Basterds," TARANTINO STYLE
","I've seen this movie like 30 times now it's so good. All the actors give crazy performance and the story just keeps going on at such a great pace.
Masterful movie from Quentin. One of his greatest.",9,0,4,21 October 2019
Dawn of the Dead," One of my favorites
","This is my top of the list zombie flick, a classic for millennials and a must watch for all zombie fans, one of the best",8,1,2,6 November 2019
World War Z," Great zombie flick
","Love zombie movies, this one is awesome, the amount of zombies is astonishing and the background settings are awesome as they have to travel quite a bit in this movie. Definitely want more!",7,0,0,21 October 2019
Knives Out," Rian Johnson the plotholehead
","Rian Johnson makes bad movies and this is another one of them. The plot makes no sense, the detective is annoying and of course the white American family is evil while the immigrant girl is the perfect person with no flaws at all. Thanks Rian Johnson this movie Confirms he can't direct at all. I gave it a 4 because it reminded me of some old hasbro board game I used to play.",4,4,9,17 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars Disney
","Ok this movie has a lot of random plot but the action is pretty good and also the special effects are nice good visuals, palpatine pulls out some Old school memes like 'DEW IT' and 'The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider.. unnatural' also they talk about the Holdo maneuver(hyperspace through a ship) at one point and they said it only worked 1 in a million times lol.
The jokes are funny and well placed, but I wish it ended a bit differently as the story is not that good for the whole saga, if the Rey saga was a stand-alone movie it would be alright but doing it this way.. they could have thought of something better
Overall it's a decent action/scifi movie but for hardcore Star Wars fans it's really not what they wanted",7,1,9,19 December 2019
Lion," Good beginning
","At the beginning it is very cute and sad story, you are really immersed and you feel bad for the kid, great acting as well.
But when he grows up into that Indian actor, the movie gets boring like a teenage love story.",4,0,5,21 October 2019
Nightcrawler," Great film
","This one is special, jake's performance is awesome he is such a weirdo but these guys really exist..
Bill Paxton of course being cool
If you like Jake's movie styles you will like this one, not many people have seen it.",7,0,1,21 October 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Epic Movie
","This movie has it all for Arnie and Action fans, it has style and substance, practical effects, good story, really really recommend it",8,0,0,18 October 2019
Aliens," Great sequel
","A masterpiece of a sequel and must watch for all horror/space fans, Ripley is badass and the marines are badass, just watch this",8,0,2,21 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," EndGame Over.
","One of the best avengers movies ever, with Thanos and all this is what all the movies have been leading to and the finale is great! The visuals are on another level.
Some sad disappointing moments but that's how the story goes.
You need to watch this absolutely if you are a Marvel or superhero fan!",9,4,10,21 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino fetish
",This movie is 2 hours of Tarantino foot fetish (like when he licked salma Hayek's feet) and the last 30 mins made for the fans,5,2,6,17 February 2020
The Lion King," Enjoyable
","Lion King 2019 flavour quite enjoyable for the new kids to learn about this story.
The images are stunning a little lack of emotions but it seems that they wanted to go more on the realistic side than the cartoon.",7,0,0,18 October 2019
1917," Boooring
","A boring movie about two guys having discussions while walking through trenches and the camera is just in front of them. Great.. it doesn't show the grittiness and gruesomeness of the First World War at all and the plot makes no sense while the main actors survive explosions in a tunnel with their plot armor.
If you like art style boring movies and want to feel like a critic this is for you. If you like action/war entertaining movies this is not for you.",4,2,12,19 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rian Johnson choices
","Rian Johnson has made extremely poor choices with Luke Skywalker's character and many others. Also Rey learning to master the force in 10 seconds is completely ridiculous..
Not to forget about the purple hair lady telling her plan is 'HOPE' to Poe which is completely dumb and makes Finn go waste some time on a casino planet to bring back an untrustworthy guy that will obviously sell himself to the highest bidder.
Kylo Ren is still a crappy emo teen bad guy but now he has sexual tensions with Rey..
Finn chooses to save the resistance by sacrificing himself but his new girlfriend Rose decided to save him by crashing into him(alright this would make them both explode) saying 'WE NEED TOSAVE DA ONES WE LOVE' while the resistance base is being blown up in the background because of her..
Then he drags her  on foot all the way back from being right in front of the enemy to the base with 0 issues..",1,9,12,15 October 2019
Prisoners," Awesome
","It's mostly raining all the time, the atmosphere fits the whole story, Villeneuve did an excellent job on this one, Hugh Jackman is threatening and Jake Gyllenhaal being the badass here makes a nice film.
The story is great the actors are all solid and sometimes you wil hold on tight to your couch due to some scenes. The violence is quite strong on some scenes so this is not for the faint of heart but there are no sexual scenes or nudity.Overall I would recommend everyone to see this, if you haven't watched it, you're missing something!",9,1,1,21 October 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The worst Avengers movie
",This movie is good but to me is the worst avengers movieDidnt feel much for Vision as hes just a robot and the romance between Hulk and Black Widow felt overforcedOtherwise decent movie in the franchise,8,1,1,15 October 2019
The Last Samurai," Great movie for the Japanese side
","Saw this movie multiple times since 2003, best watched on the big screen.If you ignore the american man who is a rifleman and comes to japan with some light sword training and kills extremely highly trained samurais who has been at war for 1000 years and then beds the wife of the one he killed while raising his kids and somehow survives everything, this movie is great.Ken Watanabe did an amazing performance, one of his best and so did all the Japanese samurais, they all feel authentic, the scenery of japan is beautiful and the story is really emotional, the score sticks with you for days, you can really see the side of traditional japan selling out to modernism and you really root for the samurais in the end but thats the way life goes, adapt and survive.",8,1,7,5 November 2019
The Departed," Scorsese Style
","This is the Scorsese movie style that is awesome, the settings, the top notch actors. Also the thrill of being infiltrated is very well done by Scorsese .
Some unrealistic elements but overall great film to watch.",8,0,1,21 October 2019
Joker," Joaquer
","Joaquin nailed the role, he's awesome in this. You can totally feel the Joker's spirit rising to become the man we all know from the comics. Very good acting. Gotham city is very well made.As for the negatives it is a bit slow paced and his laugh may annoy some after a while.",7,0,1,21 October 2019
It Chapter Two," James McAvoy
","I like James McAvoy and the redhead actress, but this movie isn't really a horror movie.
It mostly happens during daytime and there is a lot of flashbacks so you know there is no danger during those moments that are supposed to be scary.
There some death here and here and it's sad, but the way the clown looked at some point was cute and not very monster like. Trying not to spoil so yeah otherwise this movie is a nice action adventure / mystery resolving ride",7,0,0,5 November 2019
The Conjuring," One of the best horror movie of the last decade
","This movie is amazing, the actors are awesome, the story is very good.
James Wan did an excellent job, the horror genre really needed a high quality kick to get it going again",8,0,1,20 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Trash
","This movie is dumb and trash, it makes fun of a serious event in a very dumb way, A lot of the scenes drag on for too long and the way they portray history is really bad for the brains of the younger generation who will just suck it up as facts.. Worst movie about hitler ever made.",2,2,15,17 February 2020
Annihilation," Meh not so good
","Slow paced, the cinematography is bad and you can predict everything that's going to happen after 10 minutes. Very boring movie that wanted to be artsy or edgy whatever. Not good.",2,2,6,21 October 2019
