Skyfall," Definitely not the best bond of all time - isn't really a bond film
","This film did not at all have the feel of a Bond movie. It was ambitious to include such 'reckonings' incorporated in the film, including major events such as going back to Bond's childhood home (which I was disappointed but not surprised to find was not mentioned by Fleming) The whole film seemed to boil down to one big hunt, in which the villain could easily have killed his target from the start, but prolongs the attempt, making his life very difficult despite all of the very advanced technology at his disposal. The CG was pretty dismal in parts too, by today's standards. The only part I liked is when the villain reveals his 'affliction'. Other than that, I was pretty nonplussed. But hey, at least it was better than the last one.",3,30,61,29 October 2012
