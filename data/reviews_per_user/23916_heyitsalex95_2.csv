Deepwater Horizon," An amazing take on such a horrific event
","Deepwater Horizon was a film that I originally did not think I would personally be into, as I am not usually a fan of films based upon real events. I am happy that this film surprised me at how good it was. From the beginning you are given a plot that builds a bond with the main characters of the film. Of course, Mark Wahlburg's character is front and center, however there were numerous bonds built with the other key players of the film such as Gina Rodriguez's character & Kurt Russell's character. Also, as the film draws on you quickly find yourself engulfed in the realistic nature of the film as if you were actually there. A lot of respect for the behind the scenes people who make the realism possible. To go along with the character development and realism of the film, a lot can be said for the plot line. There is never a dull moment in the film. I felt a great range of emotions ranging from happiness to grossed out (some scenes were too realistic for me).The only reason I will not give this film a 10/10, is because I feel as though the ending was a little too rushed. There should have been more information given as to what happened after the rescue of most of the workers & information given on the legal aspect of the disaster.",9,1,3,1 October 2016
Deadpool," Not your average superhero movie, for your not so average superpowered human
","Deadpool is by far one of the best movies to come out of Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you have read any Deadpool comics previously you would know that Wade Wilson is loaded with humor. His humor in the comics and his personality is perfectly portrayed through Ryan Reynolds in this film. Which is why it has a rating 'R'. Definitely not suitable for children, but perfect for the big kid in every adult. You will laugh your *** off in the cinema for the full 108 minutes, even then remember to stay for the post credit scene. You will want to see it. Plus, be on the lookout for the infamous Stan Lee cameo as known to be in most marvel films, one of his funniest.",10,5,17,12 February 2016
