The Blair Witch Project," It's about time a horror film was made that didn't need gore.
",Saw this the second night it was playing in SF with my brother and some friends.  I've never been in a theater that responsive to the action on screen.  As it neared the end the audience was dead silent except for the occasion explicative uttered when something truly horrible happened.  I doubt if another film this intensely horrific will come along for a long time.,10,1,2,19 July 1999
