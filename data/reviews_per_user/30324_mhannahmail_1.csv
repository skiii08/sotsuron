Hereditary," A very unusual and inventive horror movie
","There were a lot of things in this movie I had never seen previously. It took a lot of twists and turns and you usually couldn't guess where it was going. If you are easily shocked, this one will shock and disturb you. But if you are a fan of horror flicks, see it. Toni Collette should be up for an Oscar for Best Actress for this, but since this is horror, she probably doesn't stand a chance.",9,12,22,17 June 2018
