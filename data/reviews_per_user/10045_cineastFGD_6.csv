First Man," Hollywood macho cinema at its finest
","I have to admit, I absolutely hate this movie. Not only doesn't it pass the Bechdel test - hello, we live in the 21st century - but I am so sick of the idealization of so called untouchable and cool 'heroes', idealizing a sick uncommunicative macho culture which rightfully belongs on the trash pile of history. I thought this would be a great movie on the history of the first moon landing, instead it is a portrayal of some very silly, immature men. Nothing I want to feed my kids with.Also this movie is boring, slow, and confusing. The camera work seems amateurish, even after thinking hard, I cannot think of something positive to say.",1,2,6,4 June 2020
Interstellar," Every hour of that movie feels like seven years on earth
","OK, as a start I'm not a scientist, I don't know much about astrophysics or physics in general, so you can imagine if someone like me is disturbed by the scientific level of this movie, it might mean something. I don't know whether the farmers' association of Iowa sponsored the movie, but the starting point is that due to some mysterious circumstances, sand storms and droughts plague humanity. And of all possible crops, corn, one of the least drought resistant crops, is the one to survive? This is laughable. Also, the nitrogen level in the air increases mysteriously, although we never learn why and what might cause it. The only hint we get is that our appetite for electronic gadgets might have caused this situation. OK, right! Strange enough there is nothing scientists can do about it, or they all have given up hope and now believe in Ronald Reagan playing Neil Armstrong in 'Moonlanding II'. Except for a top-secret NASA project that seeks to find a new world humanity can destroy, and that can make space rockets start unnoticed by anybody in the middle of the US. This group is apparently so short on personnel that they immediately recruit a guy, who just accidentally stumbles into their headquarter, as an astronaut. The mere fact that he once used to be a pilot out matters all missing training that astronauts usually go through before going into space. Although the crew starts out on a pretty standard 20th century space rocket, they magically transfer into a hyper-modern long distance space ship, that somehow hangs around unmanned in earth's orbit. The newly recruited pilot - having worked as a farmer for years - neatly fits into the hyper-modern apparatus without the need of any training or upgrading - some people are just gifted and act on pure instinct. We are then explained the concept of a wormhole with a piece of paper, before we, after some turmoil - caused by primitive human sentiments, such as love and aggression -, somehow end up in a black hole. At this point, my patience was drawing thin and I only occasionally took a glimpse at the film. The hero-pilot/instinct-astronaut can enter the black hole unprotected and even get out of it unharmed. Inside the black hole - which strangely enough is not black at all, but resembles a kaleidoscope on LSD - he quickly solves the formula for gravity with the help of a fellow astronaut- who happened to be dead, before he reemerges as a friend of some mysterious 5-dimensional creatures (who, by the way, remain completely mysterious all over the film). The hero- pilot/instinct-astronaut then transmits the gravity formula to his daughter on earth via Morse code (heaven forbid, if you think how long it takes just to Morse S O S, then imagine to Morse the expression 'Double integral from minus infinity to one hundred'). The genius daughter of the hero-astronaut immediately decodes the information by throwing paper sheets around and saves humanity by creating a 5 dimensional room in space (that looks pretty three dimensional) as a copy of the earth, except that there is grass on the sky (to give us an idea of the 5th dimension) ... well, if you have lost track by now don't worry, watching the movie will leave you equally puzzled. By NOT watching it, you'll save yourself the extended boring scenes of rocket wings that inflate this unedited masterpiece to nearly 3! hours, the emotional drama, and Anne Hathaway's monologue about Love, the misunderstood force that breaks all boundaries and overcomes all spaces, cringe worthy. All in all, most probably the worst sci-fi movie I've ever watched. Compared to the pseudo-science and illogic of this movie, the guys from Star Trek really appear quite believable.",1,36,75,27 August 2015
The Shining," Probably the most overrated movie of all times
","This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book.",1,287,479,21 September 2013
Into the Wild," Hm
","I have very mixed feelings about this movie. The movie itself is great, it's beautiful, well-cut, entertaining, the story is well laid out, and the acting is great. If this movie was just trying to tell the story as is, it would be fine. Unfortunately it seems like they try to make a hero out of a very immature, very selfish, and - sorry - very, very silly young man. I'm sure Christopher McCandless was a nice young man who is missed by his family, and I feel for their loss. But he was also an overly naive person who basically knew nothing of life but seemed to live under the illusion of possessing great wisdom. Well, if you know even a little bit about the wilderness, then you probably know that there is nothing romantic about it. Surviving in the wild is tough, requires a lot of knowledge and experience, and for us humans, often the help of other humans. And if you don't have all this, then at least have the brains to bring a compass and a map so that you find home again when the s*** hits the fan. It somehow angers me that this movie tries to stylize this story as a romantic experiment accidentally gone wrong. No, the only possible outcome by default was that this will go wrong, period. Christopher McCandless was an irresponsible, naive young guy, who has needlessly killed himself and most probably brought a lot of pain over his family and friends. There is really nothing to admire here.",5,3,5,14 June 2017
Sherlock Holmes," NOT for Sherlock Holmes fans
","I'm not sure what I just saw, but it surely had nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes. I've been a huge fan of the stories these 20 years, went to the museum in Backer street 221b, and know the stories and characters by heart.This is a Hollywood action flick with zero substance, which makes a complete mockery out of the characters. One wonders whether Mr. Richie even bothered to read the stories at all.Robert Downey as Holmes could easily be called the biggest miscast of the century, if he wasn't surpassed by Jude 'Smug Face' Law as Watson, who's probably as believable in the role of the devoted, admiring, and distinguished friend of Holmes as Trump in the role of US president.So, if you know nothing about Holmes and Watson and have a penchant for action flicks without story and substance, then by all means watch this movie, for everybody else: STAY AWAY.",1,1,6,9 December 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Briliiant
","I admit it, not being a fan of prison movies and being puzzled by the strange title, at first glance this film wasn't very appealing to me, but it ranks #1 on IMDb and that made me curious. I also admit that at first I was disappointed, the beginning seemed like another Hollywood clichÃ©: man falsely convicted for murder, and it all looked like yet another fight-for-your-proper-rights movie. But after the first half hour I started realising that this is not a prison movie, neither is it a movie about hope or friendship. The background story is irrelevant for the main point of the film and could be exchanged with any other story where someone finds himself in a place of desperation. What is the true beauty of this movie is that it comprises the wisdom of thousands of years of human history, starting with the philosophical school of the ancient Greek and Roman Stoics and Cynisists and leading to the modern work of psychologists like Viktor Frankl. The film even plainly states the message in one scene, where Andy says that the one thing they cant take away from you is the freedom of thought and the freedom to chose your attitude. The first night in prison, Andy does not utter a syllable, although everybody expects him to break down as the apparent wimp he seems to be. Andy truly lives Stoic principles, never loosing it, always ahead of everybody's games. Because he is focused, not trying to change the things he cannot change, like the sadism of the wards or the fact that he most probably never will get parole, but step by step changing the things he can, while being observant of the little tweaks and holes he can exploit to his own advantage. At the end of the movie you realise that he had a plan from day one, and with endurance and focus managed to pull through. Also he never lets go of his guiding principles, which makes him incredibly strong in such a harsh environment. Andy does not simply hope to get released one day, he does everything in his power to regain freedom, and through this attitude creates a leverage so strong that he is even able to crush his enemies in the end. At the end also Red gets it, instead of trying to manipulate the committee into giving him parole by telling them what he thinks they want to hear, he speaks of the only thing he had the power to change, his attitude towards life, and promptly gets released. The topic alone would be sufficient to propel this movie into the top ten of the best films ever made, but it is further enhanced through a captivating story and narrative, wonderful photography, and a superb acting performance of practically every actor involved. Morgan Freeman sticks out for me, because I admittedly have a weak spot for him, but that does not diminish the contribution of the rest of the cast. I guess it will always remain debatable which movie is 'the best', I think one should not taint the extraordinary contribution of this movie to film history with such petty discussions. Without the slightest doubt this is one of - if not the - best movie(s) I've ever seen.",10,0,1,29 April 2015
