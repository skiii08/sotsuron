Ford v Ferrari," You don't have to love racing.
","Excellent true story about how ford beat(took revenge) ferarri in 24 hours le man after ferarri pulled out of a deal to sold ferarri to ford and instead sold it to Fiat.
Cristian Bale and Mat Damon were execellent in their characters.
Races looked amzingly real. Direction,cinematography,editing were great too.
It's worth the time and you will not be disappointed.
