The Ring," !!!Freaky!!!
",I havent seen a good horror flick that left me in chills like THE RING did in along time. I would recommend any scarry movie junkies see this flick. I didn't find myself poking holes in the acting or finding problems in the plot. I was too far ingrossed into the flick to really do much else.If anything else it dropped my jaw a couple times. This does not happen. To say the least I was verry impressed with the movie,10,0,0,19 November 2002
