The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Just as Disappointing as the Novel
","This is a coming of age story for young adults, but amidst its 'clever' and 'surprisingly real' characters and storyline lies a dull, unexciting and redundant tale of a boy who just doesn't fit into life. The title is just about the only thing clever and original in this sad story. The problems that this boy faces, the insecurities that stand before him are what stand before everyone who has ever been sixteen. Now I've read the book, and I didn't particularly enjoy it, but if you want to know this lame tale then read the book. The shallow characters are deftly portrayed in the movie, but you lose the essence of their character when they alter small yet certain things in their story lines. Emma Watson, for example, was an inspired choice to play Sam. But the Sam she gives you on screen isn't the same Sam in the book. The Sam in the book is wild and confusing, she leads you on and dumps you flat. She cares about Charlie but does not know how to go about it, tormenting the poor boy during his first year in High School, while also mentoring him and teaching him how to be himself. Whereas the Sam in the movie is uncertain and loving. She knows who she wants to be but not how to get there and she secretly loves and wants Charlie, never telling him as much though. She acted it beautifully but I felt that she wasn't encompassing her character. (to be fair that was probably the script)The storyline was greatly reduced, cutting out what would have made the movie more original. In the book you get more of Charlie's sister and Brother. Heck in the book you even get more Patrick, who is by far the most lovable character. But more importantly you get more Mr. Anderson, a character who played a major role in the development of Charlie's character. In the film he's there and you get the feeling that he is important but you never really see why. You just see Paul Rudd playing a teacher in the background. The movie made the most important thing the uncertain love story between Sam and Charlie which only helps to escalate the feeling that you don't know what kind of 'Coming of age' story you are watching. You are supposed to learn all of these life lessons while viewing a movie like this, but instead you are just hoping they get together (which in the book, they do not, so the movie lied to you. They gave you a Hollywood ending.)The good points about the movie are mainly just who they casted for the roles. Not one person felt miscast, and every single person's performance was stunning. They really worked with what they were given, even if it wasn't as true to the book as it should have been. I give stand out props to Mae Whitman for her take on Mary Elizabeth. (You can really see the hurt in her face when she realizes that Charlie will never love her like he loves Sam in the scene when he gives Sam his books.) You wish you see more of her, and she quickly takes the place of your favorite character.The movie is also somewhat less annoying than the book was (although not by much.) In the movie you are not stuck inside the mind of a whining fifteen year old Charlie. Instead you feel you are hanging out with him and his friends, not knowing (or caring) what weird and useless thoughts are running through his head. I expected to like the movie more than the novel because of the casting and because I figured you would get the book in its entirety in two, to two and a half hours instead of taking the week to read it. But you don't. You get a watered down hour and a half version of an already suffering tale. I guess it could have been worse, but it definitely could have been better. I give it 5 points for story and 1 bonus point for casting. 6/10 total, if you haven't read the book, you might even give it a 7.",6,0,2,15 January 2013
Gravity," No Solid Ground
","'Gravity' is not a movie that will do it for everyone. There is no human villain and not really any human conflict, or interaction for that matter, so some people will be so bored while viewing this movie. I however was not one of them.The movie is more symbolic of letting go, moving on and learning to accept whatever life throws at you. 'Rebirth' is the theme that is not so subtly thrown at you. But even with this rather heavy and preachy theme the movie still finds ways to make you squirm in your seat with anticipation and worry. This movie is more nerve wracking than any modern horror movie out there. It is scarier than any open water film you will ever see, and this is because of the lack of human and ethereal elements. In a horror movie or a lost at sea film you're not quite as scared as you should be, and this is because even if the character dies, in the back of your mind there is the thought that at least they were on earth. It's so tiny a thought that you don't even know you think it. But while watching this film you worry that the characters will forever be floating in space, never to be laid to rest at home, or even on the planet.It's a new way and reason to be scared. This is exemplified with Sandra Bullock at the helm, who expertly bounces between terrified and resound to never see her home again. You parallel her emotions and root for her to buck up and find a way out of the scariest situation ever. And in this respect the movie is original. The special effects are also very cool. Whether you see it in 3D or not you feel as if you're floating in space. When you see her move through the station she looks weightless, like swimming underwater. It's all very awesome.So this movie isn't for everyone. It isn't as wonderful as the critics and awards made it out to be, but it was still a good movie. I give this movie 6.5/10",6,2,3,8 April 2014
Rise of the Guardians," This movie was a BLAST!!
","Rise of the Guardians was pure childhood, hopeful and wondrous fun. The characters were honest and cute and the script was touching and comedic. Dreamworks has finally made a film that rivals it's previous gem, 'Shrek.'The story is action packed but with enough time in between to just relax and watch how these myths and legends go about their business. You get great magical fight scenes between the Guardians and the Boogyman. You also get to see them just kick back and have fun. The characterization is pretty well developed so that from the five guardians and the one bad guy you have ample supply to choose a favorite.My personal favorite was the Tooth Fairy. Isla Fisher's feisty voice brought the character to life in a way that outshone the others. She was the tender care that you put into raising a child and the unconditional love you give them. Of course all of the voice actors brought their own pizazz to what the myths of childhood represented. Alec Baldwin's Santa was big and silly, Jackman's Bunny was very protective and of course Jack Frost (Chris Pine) was the young adventurer that is in every child. Jude Law's Boogyman was very scary indeed --if a little pathetic-- but then, aren't all bad guys who pick on children?This movie will make you believe in the Sandman and Santa again. It will make you wish you had a tooth to hide under your pillow and an egg to place in a basket. This touching tale will make you laugh, cry and just want to be a kid again. Very well done Dreamworks, I give you super props for putting a story about childhood legends together so well. 8.3/10",8,2,3,23 March 2013
Tangled," Disney is BACK!
","When was the last time we got a Disney Princess we loved so much? Repunzel in Disney's Tangled is the newest and by god she's awesome! With this story Disney added a new twist to a classic tale without losing sight of the endearing story that young girls loved so much. And they utilized it in a way so that boys aren't left out. I know so many boys and men who love this movie. There is just something in the characters that speak out to the audience and pulls you in. Flynn Rider (or Eugene) is the lovable thief who steals Rapunzel's heart when he helps her fulfill her dream. And Rapunzel is the quirky, innocent shut in who comes out of her shell and opens her heart to all the wonders of the world and all of the wonders of love when she gains Flynn's love in exchange for her own. The animation is startlingly colorful and superb. Disney went with the computer animation, against its usual hand drawn animations for a Princess tale, but for the story they provided you find that it works well, hell, maybe even better than the hand drawings would have. For the characters who are very 'Chibi' like, they emit real human faults and feelings. Their facial expressions just kill you as you see the pain, excitement, joy, love and regret in their eyes. The songs are good catchy tunes, sure to echo in your mind long after the movie has ended. And the villainy is terrific. Mother Gothel is one of the greatest Disney villains ever created. She not only steals the baby princess but raises her and then still has no qualms about hurting her physically and mentally. She never got all mushy and redeeming, she knew what she wanted and how to get it and she stood evil until the end, a good trait in any bad guy. Tangled may be the equivalent to Disney's The Little Mermaid because, just like back in the 80s the world had just about given up on Disney, but after seeing this movie, you will be a believer again.",9,2,5,29 December 2012
"Monsters, Inc."," A truly original film that all will love
","Monsters Inc isn't a new film, but with its re-release into theaters I got a second look at it. This movie came out when I was a 'Wee Lass' and so I could not tell you why I liked it other than the fact that it was a Disney movie. But I went to see it in 3D (not really necessary, although not awful) and I finally found out why this movie is a movie to love. This movie is an original story, and just how often do we get any of those? The monsters in the film work at Monsters Incorporated, where they have to scare little human children for electric power.You see them frightening human children who equally terrify them. One of these kids accidentally gets into their world and all hell breaks lose. The characters are witty, emotional and very well put together. John Goodman voices Sully, the monster who finds Boo and decides that he will help her return to her world, and his hardy heavy voice fits the big blue monster with a heart made of love. Billy Crystal voices Mike Wazowski, the little green fireball who's chalk full of craziness, and Steve Buscemi voices Randall, the slimy purple lizard like monster who stirs up trouble for the heroes and their little girl.The story-line is fresh and charming and the characters each come into their own as this little girl turns their lives upside down and wins their trust, their protection and their love. The setting is vivid with imagination and the everyday lives of these monsters is very similar to our own. The monsters have to go to work, pay the bills and keep their girlfriends happy.The movie gets a 9/10 for its originality, its quirky charm and the truly endearing characters who show you that just because they are labeled 'monsters' it doesn't mean that they are beasts.",8,0,1,2 January 2013
Man of Steel," A human tale about a God
","This Superman movie goes right up there with Superman (1978) and Superman 2 (1980). It gives you all of the god like wonder about the man of steel but also the only slightly touched upon human side of him. You see all of his strengths and some of his very small, very real weaknesses. They show you how even an indestructible man can feel fragile and helpless. Best of all you see how Clark Kent grows into Superman, and how he learns to put his faith and trust into the people of Earth, something all but brushed aside in other Superman movies.What really helps this movie out are his interactions with Lois Lane. Now, I've always felt that no matter what issue of Superman I read, no matter what program or movie they gave me that Lois Lane would forever be the most unworthy woman in the world to hold Superman/Clark Kent's affection as she did. But here in this movie, I feel that for the first time she is the only woman who truly 'gets' him; This is because the writers and director didn't go for the traditional 'infatuation with the most handsome God since Thor' route. They wrote it so that she listens to the man behind the power and grows with him from then on. They are presented as equals; emotionally if not mentally or physically. So even though Amy Adams was a weird casting choice, she embodied everything that a super hero's heroine should be.The symbolism that is always attached to Superman is front and center here. They present him as a Savior, a Soldier, and the poster child for Justice. And boy, does Henry Cavill pull it off. With him at the helm of this movie dozens of people will go back for seconds.The characterization for all of the iconic characters are superb, maybe even outstanding and the battle sequences are brutal enough. The bad guys (Zod and his followers) really do their job and above all truly believe in what they are doing. To them there is no other option but to destroy Earth to save Krypton. The only issue is that (and I guess it couldn't be helped) the destruction of the buildings looked slightly unbelievable. It was too perfect to be real. That was all, and yet not nearly enough to deter you from enjoying the movie. 7.4/10",7,2,6,11 July 2013
Cold Mountain," Cold Romance, Warm Story
","Cold Mountain is a love story set during the Civil War. Now this movie doesn't move you to tears, it doesn't make you yearn for great romances but it doesn't quite leave you empty either; and that is because it was carried all the way home by one shell-shocking performance.The story is rather trite but not so boring that you refuse to view it to the end. The character's earn your sympathy and friendship but you don't really know what you want to happen, because you are unsure of what to root for. The love story may be a great one, but the casting and the acting takes away from it. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman have absolutely no chemistry and every scene where they are supposed to make love to each other just comes across as forced and awkward. The jewel of this movie is Renee Zellweger; She steals every scene she is in and almost without effort becomes all that you are interested in, in the movie. Her accent is flawless, and her emotional breakdowns and highs are what keep you tethered to your seat.Nicole Kidman, who is usually the star of her films, falls flat here. She plays sorority belle gone farm girl with a beau in the war, but she conveys almost no genuine emotion. Yes she looks as beautiful as ever but you cannot help but feel that should the role have gone to someone more suited to it that the part could have been great. Jude Law was okay, he looked the part but again, with Kidman as his love interest you don't really find him too believable.All in all Zellweger really saves the film. She knocked it right out of the park and truly deserved that Oscar awarded to her. All of the small parts played out by big names (such as Natalie Portman who makes an appearance) are really cool to pick out while watching it, and watching Jude Law interact with them on his journey home is thought provoking with how true and harsh it all must have been. 6.8/10",7,1,1,2 April 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Sweet and funny, but not new
","Silver Linings Playbook was the average romantic comedy. Boy meets girl, they start hanging out, they realize that they are perfect for each other; the catch here though is that I think that the two were not really that perfect for each other. I really don't see any good coming from a depressed person starting a relationship with a bi-polar one, but that's just me. And the fact that just about everyone we meet in that town has their own set of mental problems (his father, his institution buddy and his neighbor married to Julia Styles all seem to be seriously messed up in the head) won't help this poor man get back into the right mental state of mind. If you can look over those fatal flaws however, this story is very similar to other romantic dramedys and not all bad.Bradley Cooper (who doesn't get as much recognition as Jennifer Lawrence in this film) did a fantastic job as the Bi-polar man trying to regain control of his emotions and life. His mood swings were scary, sad, but most importantly realistic. You could see the confusion and desperation in his facial expressions perfectly and you really just want to be there to help him to get better. Jennifer Lawrence also impressed me with her natural performance, although I think she is too young to play that role. Her character was married for three years and some change, but she in actuality is only 22. (Now I know that's not impossible but it's still just very unlikely in this day and age.) If you can put that aside then you can really relate/like the character she gives you. Robert DeNiro also played the messed up father very well. The dancing element in the film was a fun treatment for depression as it keeps those involved light and happy and in reach of a goal. Although not utilized as much as it should be in life it was a good plot point for the movie and a clever way of constantly bringing our characters together and showing the parallel between mental security and love. The father's 'Ju-Ju' and Superstitious beliefs were also humorous and entertaining although again adding to the fact that this man is in no condition to help out his troubled son.This movie isn't the 'all inspiring' film that the critics make it out to be, (in fact it kind of loses your attention sometime in the middle) but it's not bad. It merits a viewing from everyone, but the rom-com lovers will like this movie the most. This movie floats along the 6.5 to 7.0 out of 10 and I enjoyed watching it.",7,0,1,29 January 2013
Ender's Game," Flatline
","Ender's Game is a prime example of a screenplay adaptation failing to complement the book through lack of story. Now, I don't mean to sound harsh, we all know that a book to movie translation is hard work and never as good as we expect, but here there was absolutely no tension. The story is about a young boy trained to lead an army against the alien race that threatens earth, and save the world, you would expect some nerve wracking, blood pumping anxiety to splash the screen occasionally through character interaction and emotion, but there is nothing. It was critically missing that X-factor that would've breathed life into the tale.The actors are all well seasoned and can deliver a line but the emotion in this film was lackadaisical. They didn't ever truly get stirred up. And the script was written in a way that went out of their way to explain things that really didn't need an explanation. Also, it was cheesy the way they gave back-story or explained things to other characters. You could tell it was more for the audience than the characters.The age bump was necessary for the screen but it took away from the innocence of the characters. They came across as wimpy or whiny when they were just supposed to be young and inexperienced. And not to mention the lack of the character Valentine. (Ender's Sister for those of you who are not to sure who I'm talking about) She played a big role in shaping who Ender was and what he did, but in the movie you see her in three short scenes and it fails to portray the bond the two siblings shared.The movie just came across as dead to me for the most part, and borderline boring but it wasn't all bad; The graphics were amazing and the actors were (for the most part) in tune with their character. And the story, as basic as it was, was entertaining. It didn't push the boundaries of movie making or character development but you won't walk away halfway through. I give Ender's Game 5.8/10 for stunning visuals and an all star cast but no more for lack of usage of such valuable assets.",6,0,1,23 February 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Just what you expect
","If you are a fan of a movie with an overly corny/cheesy script, bad or sub par acting, predictable storyline and terrible graphics then this movie will give you one hell of a good time. But if you actually like movies with a decent storyline and an engrossing cast then you should skip this one.Why are Hansel and Gretel walking about with shotguns, machine guns and insulin needles when they are way back in the time of witch burning? The modern mix thrown into this tale makes it a little ridiculous. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton aren't the best of actors and although they play siblings here there is an underline sexuality to their relationship. Nothing will take you by surprise with this rather trite storyline. The language is very modern and so doesn't sound anything like the way it should sound based on the character's surroundings. The blood spurting is bit excessive and exaggerative. This movie barely utilizes it's R rating, with about 5 'F' word uses and one tantalizingly brief nude shot of a supporting character, leaving me to believe that it would have been a better story with a PG 13 rating. Then perhaps they could have focused more on story rather than 3-D blood shots.Nothing about the poster or trailer to this movie leaves you thinking that this will be a movie for the ages and so you don't jump into this with high hopes nor are you brutally disappointed by the flat fallen end result. It is everything you expect it to be. This movie isn't all bad. It's corny, short and at some points stupid, but when you want an action movie to laugh at or to not think about then put this on and in an hour and a half you'll feel refreshed. 5/10",5,5,10,22 June 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A gritty and harsh, but interesting tale
","This Gothic story is not for everyone. There are some very harsh elements in here that those with a weak stomach won't be able to sit through, but if you can grit your teeth and take it in, the ending result is very satisfying.The story follows two characters, Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, an ostracized genius. You see how different their lives are until they begin to work together to find 'a killer of women.' Once they are united for a common cause you begin to see just how similar they really are. Yes they have different approaches to the problems but at their core they are the same. And you get the feeling that that is why they get on so well.The direction of this film is wonderful, the world they live in is very gray and lethargic. The grayish tinge gives the film and story the sinister and insidious feeling that someone is watching you, that something terrible is about to happen, and its this affect that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This feeling is also elevated by the numerous side characters that surround the two main ones; No matter what personality they assume, you as the viewer have trouble trusting them.The acting is credible at its worst and wondrous at its best. Rooney Mara, a relative newcomer to mainstream movies, outshines everyone she is working with in this movie. She captures her characters awkward, self reliant, brutal but caring nature so naturally that you can't help but empathize (or at the very least sympathize) with her. She was nominated for Best Actress and it was deserved. So in character was she that you would think she was a tom-boy in actuality (when in reality she is quite the opposite, very girlie is what she is.) Daniel Craig (an actor whom I wasn't too inclined towards) delivers a believable performance as Mikael when he portrays all of the characters confusion, sweetness and incredulous-ness; he also has good chemistry with Ms. Mara and when the two of them were in a scene together the movie really took off.Overall this movie is a mysterious, dangerous and beguiling good time. I would recommend this movie to any and everyone because it was splashed on screen so accurately (more so then the 2009 Sweedish version in my opinion) and hypnotically that you will want to see it over and over again.",8,1,4,16 January 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A new refreshing style of movie
","Scott Pilgrim vs the World is based on the comic series 'Scott Pilgrim.' And although the movie uses one of the comic sub-titles (vs. the world) and all of the character names, it does not use the original storyline. They condense the whole comic, which takes place throughout a year into a week and a half. Now knowing that you may expect the movie to lack in all of the vitals and signature 'Scott Pilgrim-Esq', but it somehow keeps it together in a way that lets you enjoy everything you love about Scott Pilgrim in a two hour movie.The characters are brought to life with the best casting of the year as Michael Cera (everyone's favorite underdog) takes the role of Scott, the hero who has to fight for the woman he wants. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (seemingly an odd choice, but who delivers wonderfully) fulfills the character of Ramona, the sensual girl who brings trouble for her new boyfriend and Ellen Wong, who breathes life into Knives Chau, the jaded ex girlfriend who will have her revenge. All of the Exes and enemies and friends are also perfectly casted and portrayed by the all star character actors such as Allison Pill, (The drummer of the Sex Bob-oms and ex girlfriend to Scott) Chris Evans, (Ramona's second Evil Ex boyfriend turned famous actor) Anna Kendrick, (Scott's somewhat annoying little sister) Brie Larson (Scott's big ex 'Envy' who ruined his life) and others. The songs and tunes that the bands play are very hipster but not so annoyingly. One or two might even catch your fancy. The movie has excellent flow and despite the one week time-line doesn't feel rushed. Between each evil ex fight you get adequate storyline and character development. The movie also keeps true to all of the video game moments and quirks. It masterfully utilizes the 'K.O.' sounds, arcade punch sounds and the Seinfeld entrance noises. The acting and writing is also superb. The lines will have you laughing, and leave you thinking. The abnormal way of this 'Video game life' that these characters live is startlingly similar to the lives we live everyday, and the language they use is true to the young man's language of today. The actors all also have excellent comedic timing, something essential to this type of movie. Each eye roll, glance, and fidget is perfectly placed and helps with the uniqueness of the movie and all of its characters. Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is a new brand of movie that will leave you satisfied the rest of the day, and wishing your life was a video game.",10,2,5,1 January 2013
To Rome With Love," Woody Allen, where'd you go?
","This is probably one of the worst Woody Allen films made to date. This movie lacks all of the quirky, weird and generally unique sensibilities that make a Woody Allen movie a Woody Allen movie.The characters are all under-developed, and un-relatable; Their corresponding plots are either predictable or just incomprehensible. An example of this would be the plot line to Jesse Eisenberg's story; while watching you know that it won't work out between himself and Ellen Page. She's too flighty for a sensible man such as he, and what was up with Alec Baldwin always hanging about them? He was with them for days, was Jesse Eisenberg's character imagining him, was Alec Baldwin reminiscing? What the heck was all of that about? And what was with that average Joe all of a sudden famous, and then not famous? The story lines were just all over the place. He lacked solid ideas, and the few that he had were not elaborated upon to actually produce something worth watching, and the fact that the movie is just under two hours doesn't help its case. There is nothing in this movie that makes you want to sit through it for longer than you have to, and when it passes the ninety minute mark, it's longer than you have to.Now I don't think that this movie was all bad--just mostly bad; mainly bad. There were a few laughs, but they weren't of the odd joke or Woody Allen kind. They were simple, plain jokes that usually have no business in a Woody Allen movie. And I feel that if some of the storyline's were given an entire movie length, say about ninety minutes, then they would have had something to go on, but condensed to about half an hour each and scattered in-between the other stories just hurt what little they had to give in the first place.Overall this movie is a tedious viewing and not at all worth watching for substance. Perhaps if you are looking for something to watch to kill time you can allow it to play, but other than that I would pass over it to watch one of the more classic Woody Allen films such as Annie Hall, Match Point or Midnight in Paris.",4,0,2,15 February 2013
Frozen," A tale for the heart and soul
","Disney's Frozen is a lush movie with beautiful animation and spirit. While watching the breathtaking blue ice and snow form dazzling spirals and the characters expose their souls to each other, as the audience you cannot help but feel touched inside. This 'Disney Princess Tale' is not about finding your true love, but about a more immediate love that you are born with, and that's the love you have for your siblings; for your family. Yes, you get a slight romance between some characters but it isn't the focal point of the story, so if that is what you expected you will be surprised.Elsa shuts out her sister Anna and Anna doesn't know why. But it isn't out of malice or jealousy or superiority. Elsa loves her sister and because she is scared of harming her she keeps her distance. The journey that ensues teaches Anna what love is and Elsa her core. There are some twists in this tale that will shock you and awe you. The story gives the allusion that it will be one way and it shifts into something else. It's a good time trying to keep up with the events that almost haphazardly take place in this coming of age story. This movie is powerful in such a new way for Disney that one viewing will never be enough.The songs are cute, not really the best that Disney has peddled but they tell the story and help you to experience the emotions that you were meant to while viewing it. (My personal favorite is the opening song 'Do you want to build a Snowman?' which shows the isolation and love that these sisters go through and almost lose.) I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who loves a musical, and family tale, a Disney movie or just a really touching film. 9.8/10",8,8,20,8 December 2013
Hero," Greatest Cinematic Experience in Years
","Now I'm not as into foreign films as I should be, and this one really makes me ashamed of not paying more attention to them. The story-telling in this movie is so vivid and poetic that you cannot help but love every single second of every single story that is told. The Character Sky represents strategy and cunning, Broken Sword represents rationale and understanding whereas Flying Snow is hatred and revenge. Nameless (Jet Li) encounters all of these characters and embodies all of their aspects.The color schemes used are incandescent and only help to propel the viewers into the tales that these warriors are telling the audience and each other. With one story you get white, another red, green, blue. They set the mood and get you the viewer anxious to know what this story will say. The way that each story is presented (although some untrue) builds the characters up in a way that you see that there is more to them than their basic diagnostic. You really see this exampled with Flying Snow, as she is shown as wanton, loving, vengeful and true. In the end you really need all of the stories to understand every character fully.The director of this movie did an outstanding job. This movie has great editing and direction, it is very clean and precise, never losing the attention of the audience.If you don't like foreign movies this movie will change your mind to appreciate them, and if you already like them then this will jump to the top of your list of favorites. Brilliantly done 9/10",9,8,10,25 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Slightly less than 'Amazing'
","But still pretty damn good. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is rich with action, suspense (even for those who are familiar with the story) color and vibrant character development. The sequel has enough fan-service with teasers and tidbits to keep us going until the third film.Peter Parker is young and full of life. Easily thwarting the everyday crime that fills the streets of New York, but struggling with the promise he made to Captain Stacy in the first film. He wants Gwen and she wants him and that is not something easily buried. He is also wrestling with the demons that his parents left behind. With all of this pulling at the poor guy its a wonder he found the time and energy to deal with the villain of the movie.Here's where I have a bone to pick with it: Electro; A powerful enemy who wields kinetic energy. But this villain is anything but electrifying. He whines about being unloved and unnoticed, and then turns into this blue lava lamp/jellyfish looking creature who decides to hate Spider-Man after a verse of song is sang in his head. I don't know who thought that that was clever, but it somehow made it into the movie. Harry Osborn also plays a part, and Dane Dehaan does a fantastic job of breathing new refreshing life into the boy, that is until his big reveal as yet another classic Spidey enemy. His look was somewhat Tim Burton in a very negative way. The last thing that I must critique is the over use of CGI dive and crane shots. A Spider-Man movie without them would be dull, but this director seemed to enjoy the effect so much that it is put in much too frequently and takes away from the human tale that is trying to be told.Luckily, when those silly things interfere with your enjoyment of the film and threaten to be too much the story takes a turn back to romance and the chemistry between our Gwen and Peter saves the film from drowning in ridiculousness. Their love is the heart and center of the story and helps to shape Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man into one of the most sympathetic and redeeming heroes of this age of Marvel Movies. I therefore give 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' 7.4/10",7,0,2,15 May 2014
Brave," Brave: Great for the Family
","Brave has a bunch of Harsh reviews that I don't think it deserved. Yes Disney could've given it a better trailer because it is a tad misleading, but the story underneath is a beautiful one. The story is of Family and love and lessons and responsibilities that all young girls have to face and accept. Yes it isn't the Macho storyline that most Pixar films are but that's why I love this one. They gave Mothers and Daughters a movie they can share and love together just like they gave Fathers and Sons back with Finding Nemo (Only Finding Nemo's storyline was better explained in the trailer.) I blame the massive let down and disappointment of this film on the preview that they gave to the theaters to show, it didn't properly let you know what to expect and so you came up with a 'better' or more exciting story in your mind. (Which isn't as good as the actual film once you see it) Brave is great fun and visually stunning; It is touching and heartfelt and not at all too serious when teaching this lesson to young girls. Go see this movie and decide for yourself.",9,2,4,29 November 2012
The Piano," It's Poetry
","The Piano is considered a most romantic movie. And in a way it is, but not really in the classic use of the word 'romantic.'The characters are far from two dimensional, with ups and downs, highs and lows; both good and bad. No one is just one thing and it is a very fresh, raw take on humanity. The script colors their characters beautifully, and the story has many different aspects. But the one that stands out most, as it should, is Holly Hunter's journey from saddened, numbed woman to vibrant lover of life.The men that desire her are scoundrels and undeserving of her, and yet both are good men in their own ways. Patient, kind, understanding. It's interesting to see how and why both of these men want this woman who has abandoned all hope of ever loving anyone other than her daughter ever again. Hunter's character is an enigma. She can love fiercely on one end of the spectrum but she cannot hate. She also doesn't realize that she has a say in her life until she falls for one of the men who desire her. This movie is odd to say the least. Each time you view it you will think differently of all of the characters. You will never be quite sure who the villain is or who the hero is. But you can be sure that it is a gripping original take on love and starting over. 7.8/10",8,0,1,22 February 2016
Mama," Um...What?
","I am not a Horror movie Buff/person. I don't like them so I don't watch them. But in a bonding experience with my brother I decided to put this on. We wanted a horror movie to jerk our senses awake in the middle of the night. We wanted to curl up in blankets too afraid to look over our shoulders for fear that something might be there. But this movie wasn't it. This movie was really more about the undying love mother's have for their children, and the bond that forms between them.Now I'm not saying that that's a bad plot line, I'm just saying that it disappointed me a bit when watching it. Jessica Chastain made you believe that loving a child happens involuntary at times and you can do nothing about it. Mama shows that the love and desire you have towards being a mother can never truly die, no matter what stands in your way. And all that is great, but I wasn't jumping out of my seat from fear, or angst, and isn't that what a horror movie is supposed to make you do?Also, the digital effects that they used for Mama were outdated and cheap looking. Whenever she appeared it looked like a Video game creature, and I half expected the camera to be an RPG character with a gun ready to start shooting her. The blatant showing of Mama took away all essence of the creep factor, another essential thing when it comes to horror movies. I guess the monsters should not be shown too frequently, because if you leave it to the imagination, you'll be more terrified.Overall, I was disheartened by this movie simply because the movie makers went about telling the story the wrong way. It's not the worst horror movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely up there, despite Chastain's take on her grungy, child-hating character. 4/10",4,2,3,30 October 2013
Les Misérables," Beautifully formated for the silver screen
","Les Miserables is possibly one of the best musicals ever written and up on the silver screen kids of every age can enjoy it! Of course there are certain critiques; The beginning feels kind of rushed, Valjean's early life kind of just flies by. The characters Fantine and Eponine's stories are a bit rushed as well and they each lose pieces if not entire songs but the point they are supposed to make is still relayed. The music is just as powerful as it was in the play or the concerts, and the acting was phenomenal. Anne Hathaway is a shoo in for victory when the Oscars role around. These new takes on the characters are as refreshing as a cool drink of water on a hot summer's day; They let you see different and new characteristics of their personalities (such as Fantine's hate or Cosette's resentment.) You cry at every turn with this movie, ten minutes in your tears are prickling your eyes and half an hour in you've completely succumb to the suffering and anguish of these wonderful characters. If you are watching this in the comfort of your home you cannot help but start to sing along to all of your favorite tunes. (I know I was having trouble remaining silent in the theater.) The costume designs were gorgeous (even though some might say that some of the female characters were heavily under-dressed for the times) as the red, blue and even grays of the movie catch your eye and you find yourself sitting back trying to take it all in, wanting every little detail to remain safe in your memory. This movie was well put together and very well casted as none of the cast disappoints in their portrayal of these infamously famous characters. Special props go to the newcomers to the silver screen Samantha Barks, Isabelle Allen and Danielle Huttlestone who definitely held their own with the seasoned actors of Hollywood. This movie gets nine stars out of ten because they left out some catchy songs, it could have been twenty minutes longer and because no movie is perfect.",9,5,8,26 December 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," A Sexless Movie about Sex
","Fifty Shades of Grey captivated women's minds everywhere. It had them all enthralled in the world of BDSM and excited them to new possibilities of pleasure. This movie, however, does not do that. The actors Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have very little to no on screen chemistry. Where Christian Grey is supposed to be seductive he comes across as abusive. The stiff, unfeeling, almost uncomfortable portrayal of the character detracts from the audiences willingness to fall in love with him. There is no charm. Dakota Johnson proves herself to be new to the silver screen. She's awkward. Throw the two stiffs together naked and it just makes it worse. Their robotic sex scenes don't make you squirm in your seat with anticipation. They don't end leaving you satisfied. In fact it's more like a sex education video where it's so scientific it's not sexy. Their scenes together are devoid of the passion that is essential to any remotely romantic movie.Sam Taylor-Johnson was a poor choice to direct this purported 'erotic drama.' Her angles were questionable and the way she directed the actors was uninspired. It was as if she marathon-ed the Twilight Saga and told them to mimic their respected counter parts. The result is a drab retelling of the national bestseller. She also chose to downplay their sexual encounters, so that instead of steamy sex scenes you get some PG- 13 love scenes. There is almost no nudity and very few swear words. If she had just allowed it to be more lewd or less naked then she would've had a movie worth seeing on her hands. A more aggressive approach to their physical encounters and pleasure would have improved the quality of enjoyment for all involved.The plot line is also a problem but there was nothing the movie makers could have done there as it follows the book precisely (minus a few sex scenes.) Nothing of consequence happens to actually make it feel like you are watching a story. Instead it's as if you're listening to a boring friend regale you with their boring love life.Good points about this movie: Marcia Gay Harden makes an appearance as Christian's mother. The Red Room was actually pretty impressive.Anastasia Steel's red dress (The one that she wears while negotiating the contract) was lovely.The lighting for the movie was beautiful throughout.This movie is one that you can skip. It comes together in a less than flattering way and you will just leave the theater upset. 3.3/10",3,3,7,28 February 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Pure Disney Magic
","Saving Mr. Banks is a wonderfully Disneyfied interpretation of how the legendary Walt Disney turned Mary Poppins into one of the most beloved children films of all time. The tale is ripe with music and warmth and the quintessential storytelling that makes a Disney movie wonderful. Emma Thompson portrays the somewhat stoic and resolute author who refused to sign over the rights to Mary Poppins without being absolutely sure that she will be in good hands. You see the character nit picking in the most determined and intentionally annoying ways before she grudgingly falls in love with the magic that comes along with being involved in a Disney Movie. Tom Hanks was the perfect Walt Disney. He showed the lovable side of Disney that all kids love, but you could see the element of the shrewd and uncompromisingly strict man behind it all.This movie is funny and sweet, making you laugh and cry. You sing along with all of the familiar tunes (both the Mary Poppins tunes and other jingles found in classic Disney movies) and you smile when you notice the scenes that parallel the iconic Mary Poppins scenes. This movie is for the truest Disney fans who believe, to their core, in Disney magic. And of all the nostalgic feelings that flood through you as you watch, the most prominent of all will be a grand desire to watch what they spent the whole movie trying to create - Mary Poppins. I give this film 8/10",8,0,1,18 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 'Awakens' is Forced
","Okay, let's get the fangirling out of the way, shall we? Ahem. 'OHMYGOSH! A STAR WARS MOVIE! BY J.J.ABRAMS! I'M SO EXCITED! THE ORIGINAL CAST?!! DREAM COME TRUE! I LOVE HAN AND LEIA AND Luke!'Now for the review: This movie was, not a huge disappointment, but it didn't wet my whistle in the same way the originals did. Or even the way the Star Trek reboot did. There was SOMETHING missing from this movie, but I'm not 100% sure what that is. It starts off promising, with the new pilot character teasing at the fact that he works for Princess, er, I'm sorry, General Leia. And then BOOM! Kylo Ren comes and you get to see the new Sith apprentice in all his glory, but then the movie kind of loses it from there. It spends way too much time with the new characters; getting to know them, seeing where they come from, and all of that is fine, but a little later on please. You know who I came here for. And When you finally get to see one of the three that you paid $16.50 to see you learn something that doesn't sit well. But you have to accept it and move on. Then you're in for two out of three characters and you're still hoping that magic will formulate and you will get the fourth Star Wars movie you've been waiting for. But alas that doesn't happen either.The movie is just too conscious that it is a Star Wars movie and that the prequel series didn't sit well with the fans. Hearing that the prequels were too heavy and lacked a sense of fun this film is over saturated with jokes, making the characters seem not lighthearted but immature or just plain dumb. And the movie wants to show you that it respects its Star Wars history by paralleling the very first Star Wars movie, but it takes too much and it seems like a revamped more modern remake of the original instead of its own original story.The new trio of heroes don't have the same feel as the original three, and I respect that. These are new characters, they should feel new. But they also don't seem to work too well together, yet. And I look forward to seeing them grown into a good team. But first they have to meet, because Poe and Rey don't during the film. They also tried a bit too hard to make Rey a bad-ass and to make Finn 'worthy' or 'redeemable.' Giving us reasons to love them in black and white instead of letting us make up our own minds about them.Kylo Ren was also a disappointment. The only character in the whole of the Star Wars Universe that has not only two loving parents, but quite literally a platoon of extended family that loves him, and he turns into the wimpiest baby bad guy ever. Trying to live up to a ghost of the past that he doesn't fully understand. Ugh. Side note: Captain Phasma was awesome! Now there's a bad guy I can get down with!The three heroes of our youths-- Luke, Leia and Han are never together on screen at the same time, in one place and that is a huge slap in the face! They're who I came to see!! Overall, I can see what The Force Awakens was trying to achieve, but it just didn't make it all the way there. I still have faith that the next installment will be better. 7/10",7,5,18,19 January 2016
Looper," Very enjoyable action flick
","'Looper' is a futuristic tale about time travel. And we all know about the rules of time travel...1) DO NOT travel back in time. 2) If you travel back in time DO NOT stand face to face with your past self. 3) If you do travel back in time and are standing face to face with your past self DO NOT reveal anything about your future. But this movie took the rule book and through it out the window. Joe (JGL) is a 'Looper assassin' and it's his job to kill people sent from the future and to dispose of the body. All's well until the boss in the future decides to 'Close his Loop.' Which entails sending his future self (Bruce Willis) to the past for him (JGL) to kill. Now having JGL kill him straight away would be one boring movie so Bruce Willis gets away and the story begins.I liked this movie because it shows you how the future, and the past alike, are NOT set in stone. What JGL does in pursuit of Bruce Willis changes Bruce Willis's memory and alters what happened to him in his life. The two 'Joe's' have two different hearts, desires and beliefs. Bruce Willis's Joe is desperately in love and comes to the past to kill the reason his wife is dead while JGL is hell bent on protecting the reason Bruce Willis's wife is dead. (partialy because at this point in time the 'reason' Bruce Willis's wife is dead is still just a little boy and partially because he has feelings for this little boy's mother. Played by Emily Blunt.) Needless to say this makes things confusing for Bruce Willis when he unexpectedly and out of nowhere has feelings for this woman he's never seen before.If you don't pay attention it may be a little hard to follow, I mean it IS a movie about time travel so it does jump around a bit, but if you do pay attention and understand it the storyline is action packed and touching. JGL sees the man he grew into and became, and he is shocked, saddened and just unpleased with himself. Bruce Willis sees who he was and wants a better life for himself, and tries to do that by forcing the woman he loves on JGL, so that he (JGL) can live the life that was stolen from him. (Bruce Willis)The setting was also fun to see the characters interact with. You get both the city and the country and the future and past.I thought this movie was well written and well acted, and once you get past the fact that JGL is wearing a fake nose and chin to make him resemble Bruce Willis you really get into the story. Any action junkee will love this movie, (and this comes from the rom-com queen) I give it a 6 for storyline, a 1 for setting and 1 bonus point for casting. 8/10 in total.",8,0,1,15 January 2013
Pocahontas," Pocahontas is a Visual, Musical and Heartfelt masterpiece
","Pocahontas possibly got the worst reviews of any Disney Movie, and I for one don't know why. Yes it wasn't historically accurate but then again it was NOT supposed to be. It was a children's movie, meant for fun. Disney took a somewhat boring past and turned it into a magical journey for everyone to enjoy. Pocahontas had everything a good animated movie should have, it had the Heroine, a strong woman determined to do right for everyone, the Hero John Smith, a somewhat ignorant man who openly embraces change and information, eager to learn about other races and heritages. It had beautiful animation, the scenery was colorful enough to capture the kids' attention yet dull enough to help you be pulled into the story and not just become blind sighted with diverse coloring. The movie had an atypical villain, not necessarily Ratcliff himself but what he believed in, what his short sighted pre-programmed brain allowed him to see. He wasn't 'bad' he was just uneducated and stubborn, trying to make a name for himself and going about it the wrong way. It showed the audiences that the 'bad guy' is not always a physical entity, but the backward thinking of the past. The movie had beautiful musical sequences; 'Colors of the Wind' may very well be within the top five Disney songs ever written for an animated feature. 'Just around the Riverbend' and 'Savages' were also a great deal of fun. Not to mention that on its 2005 DVD release of the film they integrated 'If I Never Knew You' seamlessly into the movie, the lost love song between Pocahontas and John Smith, solidifying the romance that some might have thought dull upon the movies original release in 1995. The movie also teaches a lesson perhaps more relevant today than back when it was in theaters. It tells the world to live in sync with nature and to appreciate the beauty that it has to offer. In the end Pocahontas is a jewel of a movie, masterfully crafting history into one of the greatest musicals, love stories and lessons that man can receive. In this users opinion Pocahontas is one of Disney's greatest achievements and my personal favorite Disney movie.",9,2,5,30 November 2012
The Great Gatsby," The Best Gatsby
","This movie met every expectation I had, both good and bad.The director Baz Luhrmann did just what I expected him too, and that was ruin the serenity and calm that I felt was part of the essence of the book. He sped up scenes and shot from overhead, diving into angles that weren't coherent with what the story was trying to tell. The beginning was whimsical, which worked, but way too over the top with the scenes flashing all to quickly before your eyes. Luckily for him the chemistry between Dicaprio and Mulligan was sizzling and sultry. You really felt their earnest desire to just see each other, then to just lightly touch the other's hand, and their desire just built from there, so much so that it distracted you from the fast past ardor that Lurhmann loves so much. When they get on screen together you feel as if time has stopped and they are living in a frozen world together with no one else to care about. Before Daisy and Gatsby actually meet though, the movie's best character is Jordan. The actress Elizabeth Debicki gives Jordan this captivating essence, and you find yourself drawn to her just the same as Nick Carraway is. The casting was fantastic, never will this movie be better casted, as each actor fully understood just what went through their character's head and heart. Dicaprio is by far the best Gatsby I've seen, and the same goes for Mulligan with Daisy. Every actor makes you feel their character's distress and sorrow at least once each as this story unfolds. Not one character, from the naive Nick Carraway to the headstrong Myrtle, escapes your heart when you think of all that they wanted and have been through.The script was wonderfully written. There wasn't a cheesy line in all of the movie, it was all very romantic without over playing it. The actors conveyed emotion more with their eyes rather than with their words. The wardrobe was also breath-taking. I say go see it, whether you read the book or not; You will be impressed with how well the story is relayed. 7.6/10",7,5,10,13 May 2013
Warm Bodies," Finally, a Zombie movie for the whole family
","Now, I'm not a fan of Zombie movies; from the blood and gore to the completely unoriginal story lines, Zombie movies just seemed to me a complete and gross waste of time. But with Warm Bodies you get a completely new take on the whole franchise. The end of the world happens via Zombie Apocalypse and the survivors have to learn to scavenge for food and supplies and hunt Zombies and the whole thing. Then one Zombie sees one girl and a semblance of humanity is reborn within him, and with it--hope.The story is sweet and cute, avoiding all of the typical genre trappings. The two leads (both unknown to me) play their parts very well. The girl (who resembles Kristen Stewart in certain lights) showing all of the frustration with the way life is after they are pushed to the brink of extinction very believably, and he showing the unusual emotions and thoughts of his wayward, seemingly mindless character in such a way that you think to yourself that it can't be all bad being a Zombie. Analeigh Tipton (from Crazy, Stupid Love) is there as a supporting best friend to the lead female and provides some comedic relief (to an already witty and laugh out loud funny film) and reason to those characters who would otherwise be as mindless as the Zombies they attack.The soundtrack to this movie is one of its gems. The movie kicks it off with 'I ain't missing you' by John Waite, and later 'Pretty Woman' by Roy Ordison. Your head will be bobbing the entire time. For those who enjoy the classic blood thirsty element, there is plenty of that stuff too. The movie has it's fair share of death and mindless Zombie attacks.All in all a very pleasant viewing. I give this movie a 7.3 out of 10.",7,1,4,24 February 2013
