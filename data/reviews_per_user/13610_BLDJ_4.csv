The Mask," Stupid and ridiculous.
","I can't imagine how can so many people watch this movie. Honestly, there are a lot of better comedy movies out there that make you think twice before watching this. I read in a lot of papers that this movie was a piece of garbage, so I didn't watch it in the cinema, but I've watched it today in a friend's pad because there was nothing else to do.Yeah, this movie is a waste of time. Not that it's as bad as the papers said but with so many better movies out there why would you watch this one? I mean... it's not funny, the special effects are a pain in the a** and the story, like in all other comedies of the 90's is garbage.The Mask's facial expressions are too artificial and his jokes are old and unoriginal. It's not violent like the comics and make the original Mask look like a goofy... probably because Jim Carrey casts him. Or maybe because his jokes are very, really childish.Hmmm... well, these are all my gripes. On the positive side, very, really few scenes are funny and the final scene was cool. But that's all. I guess that young children may find this movie funny anyway, so I give it a 4. See, I'm Bloody John but I'm generous!",3,4,23,2 October 1999
Armageddon," Be prepare, dear reader, because I gonna crush this f***ing movie!!!
","This is one of those movies that has absolutely NOTHING on the positive side, so all my comments will concentrate on crushing it. I think that, in good conscience, I must warn you that this is one of the worst movies ever made, and if you haven't watched it yet, avoid it at any costs!!!My main gripe is that the camera is one of the worst I've ever seen. Sometimes I think that the camera man just thinks 'F*** you, this angle is too boring! I'm gonna look at something else.' And it looks like he thinks it in almost every scene! The result: the camera keeps going around and around like a crazy b*** and quickly gives you a headache!Another one is that the cast looks like a list of bad actors that doesn't 'fit' with the movie's story at all! Bruce Willis making dramatic moments p***es me off and that whatsthat Liv Tyler is a lesson of how not to act.Also, the story is very, very ridiculous! Well... I'm sure that the whole world wouldn't take the solutions that it took when trying to save the world. C'mon! We're talking about saving our planet Earth, so sending sonovab***es like they did in the movie surely isn't a good idea!Well... any other thing I haven't mentioned yet? Oh, yeah! Next time, NASA, try not to make propaganda telling us that the world is gonna blow up with an asteroid 30 years from now, OK? It wasn't funny.",1,0,3,2 October 1999
Mission: Impossible," Fun.
","CONTAINS ONE SPOILERFor those who have ever watched the old good series, get lost- this movie has absolutely anything to do with them. If you liked Jim, the IMF boss from the old series, also get lost- he's the bad guy now. But if you don't really care about matching the old series with this movie (like myself) then give this baby a try- you won't regret it.It is a very good movie as a thriller ('WHO THE HECK IS THE BAD GUY AROUND HERE?!!', 'HOW THE HECK WILL HE INFILTRATE INSIDE THE CIA BUILDING?!!', etc) and very entertaining. I also liked that chewing gum that is in reality a bomb.I only found three problems in this movie:1- No movement detector in a top-security CIA computer room??? Give me a break!2- An helicopter... in a tunnel??? Too impossible to be true. You may find it ridiculous.3- The plot is a little bad.So I give this movie a 8/10. I think I am going to watch the Mortal-Kombat-styled Mission Impossible 2, but I doubt it is going to be better than this one. Tom Cruise fighting Kung-Fu or something? I guess he will, who knows... John Woo can really become a pain in the a**, can't he?",8,0,0,30 December 1999
The Godfather," No other movie can touch it.
","Hmmmm... well... I spent some time thinking about what I would write about this movie. First off, I am very disappointed I can´t give this movie a 11. Because you see... it is that good. It is nothing more and nothing less than perfection- if they cut a part of the moive, I would miss it. If they add anything to it, I would discard it. Acting is top-notch. Direction cannot receive comments enough to describe how good it is. The story is one of the best ever. I mean... what more could anyone want?I am very sad a lot of people that voted for American Beauty made it look like as good as this one. I mean... we cannot compare both movies, can we? If this one drops one rank because of pityful American Beauty, i will be very sad. And I just can imagine anyone giving this one a 1. 7 at least. Not 1 or 2 or 3. People who give ratings like this to a movie such as The Godfaher must only like unimaginative amateur movies such as American Beauty. Sorry I am talking about another movie, but I just can´t imagine The Godfather loosing one rank to American Beauty.",10,0,1,28 February 2000
