Hereditary," This is a film for true classic horror fans and nobody else
","First of all, if you are one of those people that think movies like Annabelle, The Nun, Saw, Insidious, and La Llorona are top-notch horror movies then please, do us all a favor and skip this movie because we don't want to hear your stupid reviews.. This is a film made by a man who truly understands the essence of a classic horror movie and it is a definite success.. I consider myself a connoisseur of horror movies and 99.9% of the time I am disappointed with all the modern missed opportunities. The sad reality is that the vast majority of horror movies these days are trying to cater to the short attention-spanned dummies that want to sit in the theater, stuffing their faces with popcorn, and be jumped every few minutes by some dumb looking zombie ghost.. I saw this movie in the theater on a Sunday afternoon and I was one of only a couple other people in the room.. I allowed myself to be fully emmersed in the story and I must admit, I was literally sweating.. I literally don't remember the last time a horror movie messed me up so bad.. I didn't sleep right for 2 weeks! This is a very well acted, well thought-out SERIOUS horror movie and it will most certainly go down as a classic.. The creepy atmosphere and the way the tension is slowly built is truly unmatched in recent times.. This really is a film for true horror fans.. Do yourself a favor, put away your phone, turn off all distractions, turn off all the lights, and fully emmerse yourself into this film.. I dare you!",10,2,5,11 August 2019
Armageddon," Embarrassingly cheesy but so much fun!
","Ok.. As far as I'm concerned, you can take this movie in one of three ways:
A) You can sit up on your high horse and whine about how inaccurate all the scientific aspects are..
B) You can sit in your Prius with a box of tissues, or on your college campus in a 'focus group' and cry about how offensive and un-PC this movie is..
C) You can just calm down and take in all the awesome cheesiness and enjoy it for what it is.. A top-notch cheesy action flick..
So much fun!",10,3,3,18 December 2018
