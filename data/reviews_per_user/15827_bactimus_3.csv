Mission: Impossible III," Transmission: Nonsensical
","In the third installment of the franchise, Ethan hunt has retired from the IMF (the exciting one - not the money one) and found a wife. Unfortunately, the evil actions of arms dealer Owen Davian mean his is recalled to the service for one last time.The first Mission: Impossible was an old-school spy thriller with a complex plot acted out well by a top notch cast. The second installment was an brilliantly choreographed extended MTV music video. I expected the third to be both and more. It is neither and less.The few decent action set-pieces are inferior to the second film and the plot is nonsensical rubbish. You really get the feeling that this film was written as they went along, possible by the chief make-up artist.By far the best film thing in this film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. His excellence is rewarded by being almost entirely cut from the film in an effort not to overshadow the uninspiring Cruise.Having said all of this, the opening sequence can justifiably rank as one of the best ever committed to film. No action, just great acting and the promise of a deeper, more interesting story about to unfold. Sadly, the decline from here on in is rapid.",5,8,16,10 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Disappointing Finale
","In this third, and probably final, instalment of the X-Men saga both factions of the mutant population rally for one last clash which will decided both their fate and that of the rest of humanity.As an enormous fan of the previous two X-Men films I fully expected the trend to continue and for The Last Stand to be the biggest, deepest and best of the trilogy. Unfortunately, it disappoints on most levels.Viewed in isolation from the other two films, it has many merits. The special effects are exciting and well executed, the acting competent and the writing believable (under the circumstances!).However, the change of direction from Brian Singer to Brett Ratner is clearly in evidence. Many of the lead characters' personas are inexplicably dumbed down whilst others are unceremoniously sacrificed. New characters are introduced only to feature as little more than props. The depth of both story and intelligence from the second film and conveniently ignored to make way for more explosions. The returning cast make a good fist of things but only Kelsey Grammar vindicates the introduction of so many new faces.Saved to an extend by the enigmatic ending, X-Men 3 leaves the viewer feeling somewhat unfulfilled.",6,0,1,6 August 2006
V for Vendetta," V For Vendetta Prevails
","'V for Vendetta' follows the adventure of the orphaned Evey Hammond as she becomes involved with a mysterious Guy Fawkes-like freedom fighter known only as 'V'. The film is an exciting and worthy adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name.The film lacks the more complex and character-driven plot of the graphic novels, instead concentrating more on the collective fortunes of a nightmarish future totalitarian England. As a result it has less to say about the politics of fascism and anarchy but moves along at a faster and more engaging pace.The efforts to update the story from the 1980s to the 21st century are imaginative and for the most part work well whilst remaining largely true to the ideas underpinning the original. The relevance of much of the back story makes the film more daring and topical than its genre counterparts.Most importantly, Hugo Weaving captures the essence of 'V', the central protagonist, perfectly. Natalie Portman is less convincing as the naive Evey but is by no means bad.Despite the efforts of the talented and largely British additional cast, the American writing and direction means the picture doesn't really 'feel' like England. As a result, much of the impact of an alternate reality is lost, making the film more of an out-and-out fantasy.The film's ending is conclusive enough to leave one with the feeling of having experienced a complete package. In addition, the finale is sufficiently spectacular and rewarding to make the whole exercise a worthwhile one.",8,0,2,1 August 2006
