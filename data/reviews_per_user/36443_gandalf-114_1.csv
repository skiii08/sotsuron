Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not funny & pornographic
","I went to see this because I'm not feeling well and needed a couple of hours of laughter.If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the only parts that can even be called humorous.There are numerous scenes of male nudity - full frontal - and homosexual acts (or the appearance thereof). Needless to say, that doesn't appeal to me (this is not a slam on gays, or gay sex - consenting adults have the right to enjoy sex as they wish). I don't know where the MPAA was when rating this R.This was a total waste of time and money for me.I see a movie at the theater about once a week. I will now start checking the productions companies and directors instead of just actors and plots. So Larry Charles, Dune Entertainment, Everyman Pictures, Four by Two, Major Studio Partners and One America, you have lost a paying customer.",2,5,10,3 December 2006
