Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Do not waste your time or money!!
",Save your money. There is entirely too much going on at any one time. Too much for the brain to take it all in. The sound quality is so bad I don't think I could understand but about 40% of the dialog. All of the bad guys sound like they are talking into a toilet bowl. Maybe some of them are!! George needs to back off quite a bit on the next two.,5,0,1,24 May 1999
