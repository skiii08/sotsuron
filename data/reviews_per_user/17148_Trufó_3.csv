The Blair Witch Project," Just a tale... is that bad?
","I think this is not a horror movie. At least I was not really scared while watching it. But it worked with me in the identification level, so in the end I was not horrified, but really sorry for the characters. And that's not just a detail. This is a good movie. Well acted, well told, original in its shooting procedures. Not a classic, not extraordinary. Just good. Something many other movies cannot say about themselves.",7,0,1,3 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," More war moralina from the US
","First, the good things: this is a technically well made movie, with some impressive shots (specially at the beginning). The acting is standard good. And that's it.The plot is (at least) weak. And the chance to turn the whole thing into an interesting irony about war, military, etc., planted when the protagonists wander themselves about the reasons to save one life risking seven or eight, is missed when we see this general 'really' convinced about returning to this one mother his last son alive, right after a scene of memorable butchery.All the chances to make any serious statement and provoke debates about war (or anything) are missed in front of this kind of caricaturesque characters so common in the mainstream movies.",3,3,6,2 November 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," Great, small movie form the genius.
","Woody Allen has such control over the story telling tools of cinema that he can do whatever he wants. Mixing 'documentary' comments about what is happening with the characters, and straightforward and yet superbly filmed feature sequences, Allen shows once again why he is one of the greatest film directors of our time. Good plot, great performances, skillfully constructed characters, excellent camera work... can you ask for more?",8,21,24,15 April 2000
