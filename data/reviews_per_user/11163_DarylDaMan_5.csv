Raiders of the Lost Ark," FORD AND ALLEN MAKE 'RAIDERS...'
","This is undoubtedly SPIELBERG's greatest movie. A timeless classic that is enjoyable today as it was 20 years ago. HARRISON FORD (who stars in current hit What Lies Beneath) is simply great in this role and deservedly became a superstar. KAREN ALLEN (who can be seen in this years mega-hit The Perfect Storm) is also spot on as Marion. You have to wonder how after great turns in Starman, Animal House, Scrooged and Glass Menagerie she never became the huge star she could have. Still I think this is FORD's, ALLEN's and SPIELBERG's best work. A true classic!",Null,0,0,17 August 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," FORD AND ALLEN ARE PERFECTION!
","This is a great, great movie. Spielbergs best and perhaps the best action adventure film ever. Harrison Ford (Star Wars, Air Force One, The Fugitive) as Indy and Karen Allen (The Perfect Storm, Starman, Scrooged) as Marion are great together in this. Everything about this film is perfect! Check it out if you've lived on Mars and not seen it.",Null,0,0,4 August 2000
Hardball," Wow! What a great entertaining movie with a message!
",Excellent movie with Keanu and Diane in great form. Possibly Keanu's best performance and certainly of one his most challenging? Diane Lane gives excellent co-starring support. The kids are wonderful and the film at both entertaining yet has a morale message. Excellent feelgood fun! 100% RECOMMENDED!,9,1,1,30 November 2001
Hardball," Very appealing and uplifting comedy / drama
","This is a wonderful, appealing and uplifting film that has you laughing, crying, and laughing again. The underrated KEANU REEVES is spot on as Conor, a man looking for redemption, and the great DIANE LANE is as fab as usual in an underwritten but gloriously performed role of a schoolteacher. The kids are also great. Check this flick out!",9,0,0,25 September 2001
Hardball," Wonderful! Delightful family entertainment
","Even if you don't like sports movies, this is wonderful family entertainment with great actors and cute kids and a wonderful message to tell. Families will love this film. KEANU REEVES (Speed, The Matrix) and DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Judge Dredd) shine and have a wonderful chemistry. Definately see it, you won't be disappointed that you did.",9,0,0,20 September 2001
