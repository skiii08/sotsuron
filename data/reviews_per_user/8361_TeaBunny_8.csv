The Blair Witch Project," one of the best horror films of all time
","~spoilers~ Reasons why this movie is in my Top Five? The autumn woods, complete blackness, children laughing, branches cracking, the appearance of grave markers, dozens of stickmen in the trees, Mike screaming for Josh, crying, Josh howling in terror in the blackness, bloody teeth appearing out of nowhere, feeling alone, in the tent, dark, cold, hungry, what was that noise? We're gonna die out here.For the naysayers: I find that most people who complain about elements of the film don't seem to understand said elements. Heather screaming was annoying? She only screamed at the end of the film. Too many curses? Every 'R' rated movie has curses, and this is how people in this situation would talk. They were stupid, and didn't do the 'smart' thing? Like what? The point of them hiking South all day and ending up in the same place was to show you that there were supernatural elements involved. They were not getting out of those woods no matter what they did. 'Running like hell' would not have helped. (running? would that have REALLY made a difference?) They kept their supplies and tried to keep their wits about them. They could not FIND the car. That was the point. They went into the house because they thought Josh was in there. Scared of piles of rocks? Well, yes... they were grave markers and they appeared outside their tent! Heather found Josh's bloody teeth wrapped in his shirt! Scared? How foolish of them!Originality, genuine creepiness, no need for traditional boring plot devices, no trendy Hollywood teens in tight shirts, no predictable writing. Just fresh original scares that will affect you for a long long time. This film began haunting me when I merely viewed the trailers several months ago on Haxan's Web site, I slept with the kitchen light on for 2 months, and since then I have been a proud Blairhead.",10,1,2,13 October 1999
The Blair Witch Project," the most frightening movie ever
","Perfect, solid, well-acted, original, horrifying, intelligent, scary, disturbing, makes you think for days, weeks, months, forever. Make up your own story. Watch, listen, shiver, keep the lights on while you sleep. ORIGINAL. THANK YOU HAXAN!",10,1,2,15 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious, raunchy satire for ADULTS!
","The movie lets Stan, Cartman, Kyle and even Kenny say all of the things they can't on TV... and it's great! More than just an excuse to be raunchy, this movie satirizes society, the movie ratings system, and itself all in one shot. It's rated 'R' for a REASON -  the same reason that the show itself is on cable at 10:30PM... it's for ADULTS only!  Sometimes 'animation' does not equal 'for kids'.  That being said, the movie's raunchiness has a purpose - to teach us not to blame the world for what our children do but to look to ourselves for a change. The boys sneak into an 'R'-rated movie, and as a result begin using foul language. The parents (led of course, by Kyle's mom) want to wipe out Canadian comedy rather than face the facts that they should be paying more attention to their children. Not everyone will like or 'get' this movie. But in the words of Joel Hodgson, creator of MST3K, 'The right people will get it.' Or maybe in this case, the people who NEED to get it will not. There are what seem on the surface to be a lot of racial/ethnic/sexual remarks, but it isn't offensive, since everyone is slammed in the same manner, and the insults are there to show you how stupid they are. Social commentary aside, it's one HILARIOUS movie from beginning to end. I have never heard so many bust-a-gut laughs in a theater in my life. See it if you dare!!",Null,0,0,6 July 1999
The Shining," has been creeping me out for 20 years
","I remember seeing the trailers for this film on TV when I was 14. It's been creeping me out ever since. It's a film I always have to watch when it's on TV. So here are a bunch of random thoughts about it... The big quiet halls, the grand ballroom and giant foyers so quiet it's deafening, Danny's ride up and down the corridor on the Big Wheel and the ball rolling to him as he plays alone in the middle of the carpet. I just love the way Kubrick shoots this stuff. The sudden jump-cuts to something REALLY SCARY, and then cut CLOSER and then cut away. What's that guy in the dog/bear suit DOING, exactly? The score is heartpounding. I agree with whomever said that the manifestation of the ghosts freeing Jack from the pantry is not keeping with the rest of the story and may ruin it a little bit. You don't trust Jack right from the beginning... he's just a bad, bad man, and you feel it from the first frame. The twins, of course, are insanely scary. Grady's (remember him from Clockwork??) hacked-up wife in the tub. It's been my favorite horror film of all time for many years, only eclipsed now by The Blair Witch Project, which scared me so much I slept with the lights on for over a month. I recommend The Shining 100%. It's just a sinking, slipping feeling into insanity and then heartpounding tension and horror laced with the creepiest most ghoulish images you will ever see on film. Seriously.",Null,0,0,21 January 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," quite beautiful for it's time
","In 1968 I would have been enthralled by the visuals of this film. I still was, but to be honest I was bored with the sheer length of the silent space sequences. I understand the point of it, and the end sequence in the 'hotel room' was creepy and pure Kubrick. Big ornate rooms, panning camera shots, slow pullbacks. I like that. And the whole theme of the film is cool... the question of the origin of man, the star-child, the bizarre black kiosk. The silence was interesting and useful in many parts. I can see why this is a classic film, but I guess being from the information generation I was a bit antsy when it came to the 15-minute long floating scenes. And the Dawn of Man sequence also seemed a bit too long. All in all, Kubrick is one of my favorite directors and even though this isn't my favorite film of his, I can certainly see why 2001 has been given the merit that it has.",Null,0,2,21 January 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Real horror-show!
","ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES EVER. Mesmerizing, poetic, brilliant. A classic.",Null,0,0,27 December 1998
The Breakfast Club," The movie that defined 80's teendom
","One of my all-time favorites. Sure it had some flaws (detention all day on a Saturday? What universe does THAT happen in?) but it's worth watching again and again. One word: chemistry. These actors had it, and their interaction is fabulous. Quality work from John Hughes (not as sappy as Pretty in Pink, not as wacky as Weird Science). Truly my favorite film of his. John Hughes made movies that are quintessentially 80's, but still look timeless and are not dated at all when you watch them today. Great script. The only major problem I had with it was Alison's 'makeover' (which consisted of brushing her hair back and taking off her black sweater). Suddenly she is attractive to Estevez's 'jock' character... please. She's still the same girl who had massive dandruff flakes and ate a Cap'n Crunch sandwich for lunch. But aside from THAT... one of my faves, a great, funny movie that everyone should see and appreciate but probably only 80's teens like me will relish. It takes me back.",10,0,1,20 April 1999
Donnie Darko," giant bunnies are not evil
","Donnie's not crazy. He just sees a giant rabbit that tells him to dothings. As the film moves on you begin to piece together what is reallyhappening here, and more than likely you'll need to do a bit of thinkingand re-thinking, viewing and re-viewing to really make it all cometogether. And even then you may have questions. Movies like this aregreat. Some people don't like to think too much when seeing a film, andthat's fine. This film is for those who love to figure things out.Jake Gyllenhaal is mesmerizing. His slanted little smile, his sweet yetcynical demeanor. I just love Donnie, he's excellent. Hard to believehe's also The Bubble Boy. And having his real sister (who was so cool inCecil B. Demented) play his sis is also great. Cheeseball SupremePatrick Swayze plays what he should always play - a humorous parodycharacter - and should never make another pic where he is the LeadingMan again. You won't figure this movie out for awhile, and that, to me, is fun. Ifthat's not fun to you then you might not enjoy it so much. The finalscene with the song over the various characters' 'resolutions' ishaunting and sad.Perhaps when people are doing things that seem destructive or crazy,they are just working on a different plane.
