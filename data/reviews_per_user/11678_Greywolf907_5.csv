The King's Speech," Oscar winner all the way..
","Superlatives are rightly being bandied around left right and centre for this most brilliant of films. There is NOTHING to detract from this movie, a story brilliantly told effortlessly by all concerned.Telling the human story of The soon to be King George VI (played brilliantly by Oscar shoe in Colin Firth) who suffers with a stammer that makes his public speaking life unbearably uncomfortable in an age when the Empire was waking to the sounds of their Royals on the new fangled wireless.In an age when Hitler's Jackboot was threatening to cast it's long shadow over the continent a strong leader, the figurehead of the Empire once he became King, was needed, and a stammering King would in this era be seen as weak.Enter stage right Lionel Logue, underplayed to perfection by Geoffrey Rush, an Australian speech therapist plying his trade in London to sort out the Duke's problems.This is a must see film, and surely, if it swept the board at the Oscars justice would be done, it's that good!I can't think of a film that I have seen in the last year that has been better than this, with a sterling (mainly) British cast (remember..we do actors, not stars)the film is a delight from start to finish.For the first time in my 52 years a spontaneous round of applause echoed around the theatre at the conclusion.Ineffably fab!",10,1,2,22 January 2011
Captain Phillips," Chilling
","Out of all of the Oscar nominated films that I have seen so far, Captain Phillips is the one that I have enjoyed the most as a piece of cinema. While some are banging on about 'Gravity' (Dull and boring) or '12 years a slave' (hackneyed and clich√©d') Captain Phillips actually delivers. A fact based story expertly handled by Brit Paul Greengrass who manages to get the story told brilliantly. The Pirates, by and large are extremely believable, and the leader of the band, Muse, is particularly chilling, giving a tremendous performance opposite Tom Hanks by the book Captain. No point in over glossing the film, it's a damn good story, well told and executed without going over the top, especially at the conclusion where the US military intervene and save the day, even that is done in a muted and subdued fashion...a clear indication that the film is directed by an Englishman as opposed to a God fearing, bible chewing flag waving American!Good film, worth a look.",8,2,4,22 January 2014
Kick-Ass," Thank you England.....
","...for producing the creator, producers and director of Kick Ass...already the best movie of 2010 and one not likely to be bettered for all round entertainment!The premise is great, take an 'average' kid and place him into a world of gangsters over his head armed only with a diving suit, a couple of sticks and a bag full of good intentions. Counter that with a bitter and twisted patriarch grooming his daughter for death, mayhem and destruction and you have an almost perfect movie, one that kept me watching throughout! The balance is perfect keeping enough comic book nuance but always grounded in the real world where no one really can fly, catch speeding bullets or climb vertical walls with impunity. There is not one wasted line and the director gets great performances out of all involved. It looks like it was a hoot to make and for me, it was a hoot and a half to watch. Best film of 2010?It'll take some beating!",9,2,11,2 May 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Finally, Rathbone laid to rest.....
","It is rare...in fact possibly never that I have given a film such a high rating,but SH is most deserving of it and in the 3rd week of the new year I am doubting that there will be such a thrill of a movie yet to come along. Simply, the charisma of the two lead actors here, the way they squabble in their symbiotic relationship is cinematic gold. Guy Ritchie has done a grand job of elevating his career back on track, with his ex missus now out of the picture he can once again get back to something of his best.Both Downey Jr and Law are on top form and are a delight to watch, the humour of the film is never far under the surface and there are plenty of light moments to keep even the most discerning of curmudgeons happy.It's boy's own stuff, almost tongue in cheek yet never straying into parody, with plenty of action and Heath Robinsonisms to keep boys of a certain age purring with delight!Wonderful film.",9,1,2,17 January 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Some people need shooting....
","...namely whomsoever it was that decided to ruin the film by having such a poor ending.80% into the movie and I was seriously enjoying Butler's anti hero taking on the establishment in his own way..all was good until wham!! 10 - 15 minutes from the end the director/writer/producers///whoever came up with just about the worst ending possible completely ruining the film for many who have watched it!It also would have been a good idea if Jamie Fox's character could have been killed off in the movie...maybe 30 minutes into it and then we would not have had to endure his wooden-top acting throughout.Please please please....US film makers...when will you stop making sickly sweet syrupy eye plucking out endings to films involving children and happy families that have absolutely NOTHING to do with the previous story...it's vomit inducing.A good story, maimed by the ending and the good ol' Jesus loves us all ending so atypical of Hollywood.....",6,2,2,28 January 2010
