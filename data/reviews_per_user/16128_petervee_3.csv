Ford v Ferrari," Excellent film, tight direction, great acting.
","Absolutely excellent film : Ford vs Ferrari, with Matt Damon as car designer Carroll Shelby(Oscar exemplary role) and Christian Bale as British driver Ken Miles(perfectly cast).Well done although I thought Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife and related story was unnecessary and interrupted the tight screenplay.John Bernthal was amazing as Lee Iacocca (who in real life saved Chrysler and who passed away four months before the film was completed). Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II was also great as was Remo Girone in the role of Enzo Ferrari.It may be called Le Mans '65 in your country but the film is really all about Ford and Ferrari.Of course special effects abound (one has to recreate the 1960's - my favorite decade) as with most modern Hollywood films (although Infernum, my latest film has no special effects and still makes the point across using excellent location shooting).The Le Mans scenes were filmed in different places and seamlessly edited together so the viewer sees just one location.Finally, I wonder why didn't they use Mclaren as the driver working with Shelby instead of Miles, as he ended up creating his own super car company and probably has a more interesting story to tell than Ken Miles. who knows, it may become Ford v Ferrari, the sequel.",8,0,2,23 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Hasn't the script lost itself?
","I had seen Blade runner and like most people really liked it. The idea of a metropolis full of replicants chased by a well chosen Harrison Ford for the role of a cop looking for them, in a world extremely well created by Ridley Scott was amazing.
Now comes Blade runner 2049 with Ryan Gosling. First of all I had recently seen LaLa land and I after that, I thought Ryan was miscast in 2049. Don't get me wrong, he is a fine actor, but thinking of a singing Ryan followed by a killing Ryan confuses a brain. Then I thought 2049 was just too long. Coming in at a little under three hours, I wonder if there will be a shortened version coming up, without all the stuff that is not particularly needed. Then am I the only one who found the script difficult to follow? The special effects are excellent (imagine what Ridley Scott would have done if he had them back in the 80's), and the score mesmerizing. I give it a 5. I really don't think it's worth the 8/10 people give it; after all it certainly is not up there with 2001 Space odyssey or the original Blade Runner.",5,2,6,11 May 2019
Up in the Air," A very good movie and a parallel universe to me
","After getting enough encouragement from facebook friends to go see this movie, I finally made it and was pleased to have done so.This movie is close to my heart and life. I fly often. Not 350,000 miles as Ryan (played so convincingly by George Clooney), but about 200,000 miles per year. In 2009 I flew 159 times. I was on the road for almost 300 days. I do consider airports my places, have learned how to go through security (and yes I do follow people that have very little hand luggage), have learned how to get miles from everything (although I would never sit down and exchange loyalty cards with anyone because, what's the point) and how to live, an at times, pretty lonely existence.The fact the Ryan meets a lovely woman with similar life at an airport is interesting, although many women I meet flying certainly do not have kids and if they did, would not fly as much as she does. It is a life choice.George plays the role very well, although you would think that after getting #7, he would give up his airline seat, instead visiting airports where he can go see his 'Ryan' labeled airplane. The film of course finishes in a way that there will be Up In the Air 2 coming soon in a theater near you. Maybe this is the plan.I don't give this film a 10 because: Would a company really sent a 25 year old to fire people? Would people that have worked at a company all their lives really accept to lose their jobs by such a young person? And is it morally acceptable to use video conferencing to do such a life changing event? Or we just accept this movie as, well a movie.And finally is there a need for so much endorsements in this movie? Do we need to push Hilton, American Airlines, Hertz and every other company mentioned. Or future movies will become infomercials. Or maybe this movie could not be made without names, any names. Yes, this is a good movie and recommended to anyone who lives Up in the Air. Just like me.",8,0,2,1 March 2010
