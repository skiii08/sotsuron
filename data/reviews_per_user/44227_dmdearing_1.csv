Mission: Impossible III," Might have been okay had it had a plot.
","Mission Impossible 3 is definitely the worst of the series. I'm not saying that the other two were masterpieces, but at least they were decent. The third installment has so many plot holes and gigantic voids in the storyline that it is almost impossible to appreciate what is going on. Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise)goal, as in every action movie of this caliber, is to recover a generic super weapon in order to save the woman. Fair enough, I've seen James Bond save plenty of women over the years, and he made it worth my while. Problem is, you never once figure out what this horrible world ending device is. And at the end of the film when Cruise asks the head of his bureau what it is, he basically says 'Not telling'. If you can tell me at least one viable reason for the writers to leave out what the hell the focus of the movie even is, Id be glad to hear it.The special effects were decent but the movie even lacked in them when compared to others of its kind. It had some nifty devices and remote turrets, but be ready to experience more of the face masking bull crap that you saw in the second one.Had the movie been a little more clear, it would probably merit a more solid rating. But it's disappointment in those areas merits it no reward.3/10",3,1,3,13 May 2006
