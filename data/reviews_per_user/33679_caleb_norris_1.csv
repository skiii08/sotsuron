Requiem for a Dream," The best film of 2000
","Darren Aronofsky showed that he knew how to tell a visually-striking story with 'Pi' in 1998, but with 'Requiem for a Dream' he stands as the best director of the new generation.  Kevin Smith, Alexander Payne, Todd Solondz -- none of them have the audacity, the love or passion that Aronofsky does. Ellen Burstyn was robbed of an Oscar for her portrayal of Sara Goldfarb, a lonely Coney Island widow who embarks on a dark journey of madness when she is perscribed diet pills by a quack doctor.  The film centers on her strife, and it is harrowing and unforgettable to watch a human being disinegrate in front of your eyes. The acting, direction, production design, score and cinematography are first-rate.  'American Beauty' presented a high bar for a film to reach for. 'Requiem for a Dream' rises to the challenge.",Null,0,0,30 April 2001
