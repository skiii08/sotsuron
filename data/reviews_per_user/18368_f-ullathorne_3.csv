Skyfall," Extremely disappointing
","This is certainly the least impressive of the Daniel Craig Bond movies. Daniel Craig is wooden and lacks charisma, the Javier Bardem character is straight out of Little Britain and Judy Dench is past here sell by date. Plot is very thin and predictable. Acton is limited and extremely choreographed. Went to see it last night and the gent next to my wife slept through the whole film. If this was not a Bond movie it would be dismissed as a very ordinary movie - no suspense In it at all - not even as good as Taken 2 which was ridiculed by the critics. If this is the best that Sam Mendes can do with a very popular movie brand then he needs to go back to the older movies and understand what made them such a success.",5,23,49,1 November 2012
American Hustle," Is this a comedy or what?
",Watched this film in a packed cinema in UK about 10 days ago and can honestly say that this film did not raise one bit of laughter. You could even say it was unfunny. How this film could win an award for best film comedy beggars belief. Not only was it unfunny but it was boring to an extreme. The person next to me fell asleep after 10 minutes and my wife and I both struggled to stay awake. The answer may be in the difference between the UK and US sense of comedy but to see this film nominated for a BAFTA seems to suggest that the UK academy is just following the US academies like sheep and are not making their own minds up about the film. To sum up this was probably the worst film that I have seen in the last 12 months and is definitely not worth any awards when there are films like Gravity etc around,2,13,23,23 January 2014
Atonement," Despite the hype - it's a poor film.
","What a disappointment - what was the point of it. All the characters were weak - and the choice of actors playing the parts did not help. Neither Keira Knightly nor James McEvoy had the stature to carry off their parts and neither could evoke any sympathy from the viewer. Briony came over as a spoilt brat - why did anyone believe her at all - and why was the aftermath of the accusation just glossed over. The gap between the incident and the next time you saw the 'heroes' only served to confuse. One part of the film was a total farce - the scenes of the retreating soldiers in Dunkirt with the fair rides, singing soldiers in the bandstand, drunkenness and scenes of apparent total confusion are contrary to any historical fact - what point was the film trying to make here - was it some anti-war message - if so it was in bad taste.",3,26,53,13 September 2007
