The Blair Witch Project," Woah boy!! What happened?!??!??
","Truthfully, this should have been the WORST film on the face of the planet..consider the evidence:Storyline - dross... Cast - dross (or so we thought...) Camera work - worse than dross... Publicity - non-existent Budget - less than a years salaryI watched this film for the first time last night, thinking it a decent filler until the next show - and wanting to see what the fuss was about...SO - I repeat - WHAT HAPPENED????How did all of these dross elements come together into such a terrifyingly and disturbingly claustrophobic film?The answer is elusive (if it weren't, Ed Wood would have got a few more Oscars!).  I think it is that which 'Makes' the movie. Elusiveness...there is no direction at any point in this film - apart from the closing seconds as Heather runs down the stairs.  Everything is hidden - to be honest, I don't want to watch this again to SEE who that was standing in the corner - the vagueness is, I think, what set this film up to succeed.  Even the title is vague, the camerawork is vague, everything about this movie is a BLUR...and I think that this is what captured the imaginations of both the makers and, subsequently, the viewers.My 'Decent Filler', quite frankly, scared the hell out of me (or into me - depends on your point of view!).  I have hired the sequel out tonight, but can't help thinking (as obviously everyone else did except the producers) that it is on to a loser...Don't look outside your front door in the morning...",Null,0,1,21 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Groans.......
","Let's be honest about things for a second...Every one of the original trilogy was slated at some point by a large amount of people - these days, 20 years later, there are just more means to do it and therefore everyone has to voice an opinion somewhere...and to the people who sit in front of the PC slagging off the movie and pointing out the bad bits I say these 8 words...IT'S ONLY A MOVIE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!To those of us who enjoy Star Wars for what it is i.e. ENTERTAINMENT, Episode II is a delicious slice of escapist wonder, exactly the same as the previous 4 episodes (Yes - I most certainly include Episode I in that statement!).  It is never going to be perfect - show me a film that is? for those people who don't like it - FINE! GO AND MAKE A BETTER MOVIE!!!!! (Oops, sorry Mr Spielberg!)It is a movie that encompasses, and enhances, elements of all 4 previous outings, and takes them to the next step...OK, so people think the script ain't up to much - and to those people I say look at the original Star Wars (Or A New Hope for the purists, if you insist) - the script was far worse then!!  Characters? Everyone laughed out loud at the droids in that movie - in fact fans have had something to moan about in each of the movies (Jedi Master is a MUPPET!!!! Galaxy saved by TEDDY BEARS!!!!!).  In fact that brings me to the one PERSONAL dislike of Ep II - the somewhat IN MY OPINION misplaced humour, hence the title of my post...please notice that I emphasise IN MY OPINION - I am not trying, like many people on here, to ram my opinion down your throat.To the people who don't like it I say FINE!!! Go and watch something else you DO enjoy! But if you have nothing better to do than go on about how bad YOU think it is, you desperately need help my friends...To the vast, vast majority of people out there who DO like Ep II, join me in shouting one big MR LUCAS, EPISODE III CAN NOT COME SOON ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,0,24 May 2002
