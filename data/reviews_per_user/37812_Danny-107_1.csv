Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," *WARNING - REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
","Star Wars was hyped more than any other film in history, and the expectations of this film were so high that if it were nothing less that a work of cinematic genius, the critics would slam it and say what a bad film it was, and instantly compare it to it's predecessors; I think that George Lucas provided us with a masterpiece. I went in to the Cinema, and was really excited when the opening credits began to roll, and from that point on, I was enthralled by what I consider to be one of the greatest films ever made. Lots of people have complained that the film got started far too quickly, and we were thrown in to the action too quickly. I have to disagree with this, as the quick opening and getting in to the film immediatly was a good touch for me. The characters were developed adequetly, but not so that we could know them inside out, but, afterall they are Jedi Knights, we're not meant to know them are we? Did we know all albout Obi-Wan in the original film? No. I also loved the fact that there were two Jedi Knights strolling around, and that almost everyone was terrified of them. That was a marvellous touch. The storyline for me was excellent, and people who say it was boring should maybe watch the film again, after watching the original trilogy once more. It was clear to me that all the way through, Senator Palpatine was The Emperor, and the film was telling how he maouevered his way in to power, and then used his power to turn to evil. It's a great set up for the next films(s) which is basically what this film was attempting to do, much as 'A New Hope' had done before.Now on to the characters. Liam Neeson was fanstastic, and quite mystical, as Qui-Gon Jin. Sure, the character wasn't developed greatly, but who wants to know what goes on in the mind of a Jedi? I don't, that would ruin it for me. We didn't see as much as I would have liked of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan but what we saw of him was good enough, and the two Jedi's in my opinion were great and well cast. Jake Lloyd as Anakin wasn't brilliant, but he's 8 years old, and did a grea t job for his age. I'm sure that will be one of his proudest moments, acting in a Sar Wars movie. Jar Jar wasn't as bad as everyone makes out, but he is quite annoying but is intended to be that way. He was a character that the film could have done without, but I wouldn't complain about him being there, because as many people have said, was there for the younger generation, who Lucas is trying to capture as a new wave of Star Wars fans. And, finally, on to my favourite character out of ANY of the Star Wars films....Darth Maul. This guy was phenomenal, and was one of the most menacing characters ever created. Ray Parks did an awesome job as the Sith Lord. The who Maul character was brilliant. From his introduction on the hologram where he stepped beside Lord Sidious, to where he landed on Tattooine and chased Qui-Gon on his speeder, to his fantastic light-sabre duel at the end of the film. I would have loved to have seen more of him, but I think that his short moments on screen added to his character. If we had seen more of him, he would have lost some of that mystique about him, and wouldn't have been as exciting when we finally did see him. What can I say about the light-sabre duel? Nothing but incredible!! So, all in all I would say Star Wars Episode 1 lived up to my expectations. It was a truly fantastic film, and I'm sure I'll go and watch it again ad again and again! I just can't wait for the next one to come out.",10,0,0,28 August 1999
