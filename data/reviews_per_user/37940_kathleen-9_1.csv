The Blair Witch Project," Single-handedly the most disturbing film ever made.
","Im writing this less than an hour since I've saw 'The Blair Witch Project'. This is the most terrifying movie I have ever seen.  There is not one moment in this film where you don't feel disturbed, to put it lightly.  You feel terror, genuine terror, because the images are SO real.  The entirety of the film, your scrunched down in your seat, biting your nails down to the blood!You want to scream but you can't because its caught in your throat, your heart is beating overdrive: therefore at the end, it feels like it'll explode, your breathing spiratically, heavy, and shallow...  If your not one for horror movies, even if you are, think twice about going to see this because theres not one moment, not one that your totally at ease with it. This movie scared the s--- out of me, and let me tell you something people, I will NEVER, NEVER go into the woods again! PERIOD.",Null,1,1,5 September 1999
