United 93," Incredible
","The fact that the overwhelming majority of the victims (especially at Columbine) were conservative white Protestants seemed almost beside the point. On national tragedies of these scales, everybody needs to be able to, as Bill Clinton so memorably put it, 'Feel your pain.'With his realistic reenactments of the events of 9/11, Paul Greengrass has created a chilling and unforgettable film experience For some, it may be too real and yes, too soon.That be as it may, Greengrass, who did such a great job recreating the 1972 civil rights march in Northern Ireland that turned deadly in 'Bloody Sunday,' has found a unique narrative in telling a story that isn't solely about the United 93 passengers who decided to take back their plane from hijackers. Instead, it's more of an overview of some of the events from that fateful day, many of which few have been able to see, despite the 24-hour media coverage following the attacks.",10,2,8,29 April 2006
Lords of Dogtown," Not so hot
","All of the skateboarding and other 'extreme sports' action may be enticing for some kids to imitate, as might other behavior (wild antics, teen drinking, manner of dress, etc.), while some of that results in bad falls and spills (but nothing too injurious). Some fighting occurs in several scenes, as does some property damage.Some of that material may be unsettling to some viewers, while various characters have varying degrees of bad attitudes. Various teens and others drink, some use drugs (and drug related comments are made) and some smoke. Finally, some tense family material is present in strained relationships between teens and parents or parent figures.Should you still be concerned about the film's appropriateness for yourself or anyone else in your home, you may want to look more closely at our detailed listings for more specific information regarding the film's content.For those prone to visually induced motion sickness, a great deal of the 'you are there,' documentary style, hand-held camera footage will definitely affect some viewers.",3,16,37,29 April 2006
