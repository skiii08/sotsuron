The Blair Witch Project," Not once has there been a more brilliant, simple, and absolutely terrifying horror film than 'The Blair Witch Project.'
","What genies horror filmmakers will tell you is that human beings are afraid of the unknown more than anything. A chilling and absolutely terrifying horror film titled 'The Blair Witch Project' is a film that gets it. Writers and directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez take the fear of the unknown and make one of the lowest budget films of all time and the single scariest film of all time. 'The Blair Witch Project' is about three film students making a documentary about the legend of an evil witch in a forest near a small Maryland town. The three interview locals about the legend before entering the woods on a scary adventure they will never forget. The entire film is shot by one of the students named Heather. She is accompanied by Mike and Josh. The filming goes smooth until they get lost and are haunted by the witch at night. There are many aspects that make this film terrifying. The main factor is how it is filmed in a way that it looks like actual footage by these three people. Haxan Films did the brilliant job of marketing this film by making fake missing signs for Heather, Josh and Mike. The film looks and feels so real that you'll never go hiking again. The three encounter various noises in the woods, leaving us unclear on what they are. We never see what the three are afraid of. We don't know what we're going to expect. The names of the characters are the names of the actors. Many thought this was a true story, but the truth is it isn't. The actors are now going on to do more acting and even said this was just a story in interviews. That doesn't take away its fear factor. 'The Blair Witch Project' is full of scares to haunt you forever. The acting by these three is so realistic and stressful. The entire time they are lost and frustrated that it starts to wail on you. The night scenes make you think if you were in their shoes, making it only more terrifying. Not a single blood spill is in this film. It's all horror that tricks with your head and you won't be able to get it out. It will scare you forever.",Null,0,2,31 August 2014
The King's Speech," Gifted performances and talented writing/directing make this a historical gem.
","Biopics and historical time-pieces are either masterful or plain boring. 'The King's Speech' is the kind of historical biopic that is masterful. We follow the story of the man who became King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II. After his brother abdicates, George (Colin Firth) reluctantly assumes the throne. Plagued by a dreaded stammer and considered unfit to be king, George engages the help of an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel (Geoffrey Rush). Through a set of unexpected techniques, and as a result of an unlikely friendship, George is able to find his voice and boldly lead the country through war. Sound like a snoozer? Don't be fooled. Director Tom Hooper leads this film down the right path, giving the film a wonderful production and costume design that helps establish the historical importance of this film. He also crafts a truly mesmerizing and elegant scene, where King George finally gives his speech regarding the politics of war during the time of his reign. Colin Firth and Geofrey Rush and flat- out wonderful, giving witty and poignant performances that accompany Helen Bonham Carter's work as King George's wife Elizabeth. Tom Hooper does wonders bringing David Seidler's script to life, a written work of wit and history that makes for one terrific movie that will be remembered for years.",Null,0,0,19 August 2016
The Lobster," Had the potential to be a great original dark comedy.
","'The Lobster' is a creative idea that could potentially have examined human connection in an intimate, heart-breaking way, but instead takes terrible direction. Not one minute of this film is interesting or comforting. In a film dealing with unique idnivudals and conflicts, this film is surprisingly dull and passionless. Yorgos Lanthimos is a horrible director in the film, having no artistic vision and instead getting carried away in the awkwardness of his garbage script. This is a film that should be completely avoided, yet had the potential to be a strong film worth seeing.",Null,0,2,29 May 2018
Moneyball," The behind the scenes of baseball.
","'Moneyball' isn't the typical sports film in which an outcast lead character with the odds stacked against him manages to be victorious in the end. It's a film where, like almost everything in life, the main focus is one and how our world revolves around it. Baseball is an American classic, and with Bennett Miller's interesting and strong film about a failing baseball team in the MLB, we see the politics and business behind this classic game. Brad Pitt gives a great performance who has great on-screen charisma and a euphoric chemistry with Jonah Hill. Pitt does a good job of not overdoing the emotional aspects of his character, yet showing a heart behind his snark attitude. 'Moneyball' is a different look at baseball and one that delivers a different and delightful story.",Null,0,0,31 May 2018
The Avengers," As big of a blockbuster as they come.
","All of us deep down have something for superheros. Whether we grew up with them as kids or just really enjoy seeing them smash into stuff, these mythical, larger than life heroes tend to stay with us throughout or entertainment experiences. And boy do they make a lot of money. Shattering multiple box-office records across the globe, 'The Avengers' is a Marvel fan's wet dream, combining Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Hawkeye, Thor, Loki, and Black Widow to fight it out for hours. The visual effects don't disappoint, creating giant explosions that never seem to go away or have a direct cause. With fun little jabs at each other, these superheroes and villain end up causing a huge raucous that is consistently stupid and entertaining. This is the kind of movie you'll enjoy for a bit if you're not huge on superheros, but will love if Marvel is your thing. The explosions and dialogue get a little out of hand, but Josh Whedon knows what he's doing, and he does it well.",Null,1,3,23 March 2016
First Man," Another dull biopic.
","Biopics are either a hit or a miss, occasionally being something fresh and new, while most of the time being a regurgitation of history. Damien Chazelle's (Whiplash, La La Land) First Man sadly fails to be something new, instead falling in line with other Hollywood true stories about an important historical figure.Joining the same group as Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. Gandhi, Julia Child, and Steve Jobs, Neill Armstrong was naturally next in line for Hollywood to present his story. In what seems like too obvious and cliche of a title, First Man has its visually stunning moments, most notably when we actually get to see the moon, but drags out and is painfully dull throughout.Ryan Gosling gives a very underwhelming performance as Neill Armstrong, the astronaut himself. Armstrong, portrayed as a quiet, soft-spoken and determined man of science, isn't depicted in any interesting or engaging fashion, which could be due to Gosling's boring, nuance-less portrayal. Gosling simply doesn't have the charisma and talent to bring a historical figure to the screen. In his best performance in Drive, he barely speaks, yet is captivating throughout due to the reserved, mysterious character he portrays. In Blue Valentine, he shines as he falls apart from his wife due to his rich emotional and honest sketch of lost loved. With Neil Armstrong, he doesn't show any different or unexpected sides of the famous figure, instead revealing him to be what we already know him as- a really good astronaut.First Man tries hard to be about more than just Neil Armstrong landing on the moon, but the harsh reality is the only intriguing scene is when we actually see Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin land in the moon. The film tries to generate emotional appeal (largely relying on Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife) by revealing the struggle Armstrong's dangerous mission had on his family, yet the emotion and drama simply isn't there. The death of him and his wife Janet's daughter doesn't sink in or have a strong enough effect on the audience to make us feel for Armstrong's personal struggle. The minor dramatic tones are simply there to distract us from thinking the film is all about the moon landing.Damien Chazelle does a fine job making First Man visually appealing, the scene on the moon that is ever so brief is stunning, the musical score by Justin Hurwitz soothing, the production deisgn and cienmtogprhjy eye-catching at times. But what he fails to do is tell an interesting story that is foreign to us. First Man takes us into the personal life of Neil Armstrong, but it isn't compelling enough to make a movie out of.",Null,1,2,26 January 2019
Changeling," A mother's worst nightmare.
","Clint Eastwood always brings powerful true stories to life as a director, engrossing the audience to view his historical characters as people and not just characters. Playing the real life Christine Collins, a grief-stricken mother who takes on the LAPD when it stubbornly tries to pass off an obvious impostor as her missing child, while also refusing to give up hope that she will find him one day, Angelina Jolie gives one of the most powerful and heartbreaking performances by a woman in modern times. Jolie captures the mental disturbance a mother faces over her child and the harsh terms faced with the ice-cold reality of not knowing where someone you love is. It's an heavy and detrimental performance. With a layered story that examines multiple aspects of the kidnapping, Eastwood uses visual bliss and beauty to turn this horrific story into a marvel. Using disturbing scenes with the psychopath responsible for Collins's son's kidnapping, the power is endless and haunting. 'Changeling' provokes your mind while wisely ending hopefully but not yet resolved. A gloomy mystery splattered in darkness transforms into a lesson on parenthood and the risks of maternity due to the bold collaboration between the magical Clint Eastwood and the powerful Angelina Jolie.",Null,1,2,27 February 2015
Requiem for a Dream," Experience failure of the body and soul.
","Before he directer movies about Noah's Ark, Darren Aronofsky had a set of skills behind the camera that incorporated audiences into his films like no other independent filmmaker. In his darkest and most profound work 'Requiem For a Dream,' we engage with four lives ruined by a dangerous aspect of our society- drugs. Four different addicts all see their lives crumble into pieces from seemingly habitual drug usage that unfolds into a mind-shattering and destructive addiction. Sara (Ellen Burstyn in a profound performance) is a lonely widow hooked on diet pills while her son Harry (Jared Leto) is a junkie hooked on heroin with his lost girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his buddy. All four characters have desires and goals that get crushed by the addiction of drugs that flat-out ruin their lives. With flawless details on the atrocities and horrors of drug abuse, Aronofsky shows you everything bad about drugs. He shows you, not tells you. Aronofsky has done something special. He makes you feel as if your the one using drugs, not the characters. Instead of watching various failures abuse themselves, he places you inside their skin through his kinetic and speedy camera-work and the artistic cinematography composed on dark lighting and terrifying sounds to drag you into a brutal and flawless nightmare. With legendary performances and a diverse range of people to show how drug abuse can happen to any people of any race, age, or gender, 'Requiem For a Dream' is an important classic useful for educating the public on drug addiction and on how to get the blood pumping from an audience while simultaneously swooping them off their feet. Arronofsky and sacrificially Ellen Burstyn deliver work for the ages that can only haunt you and stick in you gut like an actual drug.",Null,0,1,16 March 2015
Captain Phillips," Paul Greengrass delivers a true story that will leave you shaking for days in 'Captain Phillips.'
","It's very hard to find thrillers these days that are actually thrilling the entire film. In Paul Greengrass's 'Captain Phillips' expect to be enthralled in the film the entire time. Tom Hanks plays a captain of a cargo ship headed from Somalia to Kenya in order to supply food for the hungry. The ship is sailing smooth until a group of Somali pirates hijack the ship, leaving Captain Phillips to become a leader and create a peaceful solution. The entire time you see the difficult situations Captain Phillips has to make in order to protect his crew. When the U.S. government gets involved in the story, expect your heart to beat a little faster. The intensity Paul Greengrass captures provides pure entertainment that isn't forced in the slightest. His artistic vision makes this film seem like your watching a videotape from the actual event, instead of a brilliant motion picture starring an Academy Award winning actor. The editing makes it feel as real as possible. The pirates are amazing, especially the leader played by Bakhard Abdi. Tom Hanks gives another Oscar-worthy performance as Captain Phillips. What's really special about this film is that the screenwriter Billy Ray doesn't portray the pirates as the 'bad guys' and Captain Phillips as the 'good guy.' He tells a story in the eyes of many people and provides genius character development. Any storyteller can watch CNN and make an intense true story a film, but Billy Ray really tells a story instead of an event. Even knowing how the film ends due to watching the real news story I was still shaking rapidly due to the intensity. Not a single second of the film is over-done. Every actor is cast perfectly and you'll see a great story of leadership from Tom Hanks as American hero Captain Phillips. If you want to see world class film making and have fun at the cinema, check this one out.",Null,0,2,2 June 2014
Source Code," 'Source Code' is an entertaining ticking time-bomb of a movie!
","'Source Code' always has something new for its protagonist, Colter Stevens, to learn. It's the kind of intellectual thriller that takes place almost entirely in the past and always has some form of suspense weighing down on you. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Colter and couldn't have been cast better. Gyllenhaal works much harder than most actors his age, as shown in this thriller. Colter is woken up on an unfamiliar train that involves many different types of people including the beautiful Michelle Monaghan. After the train suddenly explodes in Chicago, Colter wakes up to a secret government agency that has Colter go back in time to try and find the source of the bombing. We later find out much more about this agency and about Colter. Ben Ripley does a smart job as a writer by starting of right in the middle of Colter's situation without him knowing anything about what he is going to experience throughout the film. We start off in a peculiar setting and adapt to the conflict just as Colter does. Each time Colter fails it's fun to have to go back in time to stop the bomb all over again.There's always have something to fix and find out. Director Duncan Jones did disappoint me. He does do a good job of adding constant ignorance and suspense, but he isn't dark enough. The weak visual elements and mediocre explosions take away the darkness of this terrifying plot. A lame crucial score, shallow dialogue and a poor ending that seems sort of like a cop out take away the complexity this thriller has to offer. Seeing Colter transform back to the past every time is shot in a very cheesy way as well. 'Source Code' excels at what it tries to. Jones' direction is full of shocking entertainment and has a very unique plot that is unlike most films. We have many questions that all get answered eventually. The brilliant editing to make going back to the past the same and different each time is fun to see in Colter's point of view after he familiarizes himself with his setting. The action is balanced with touching drama and a big heart.",Null,1,3,14 November 2014
Skyfall," James Bond films just keep coming.
","James Bond has been part of cinema for years. These films contain classic aspects such as acting and dialog. in 'Skyfall' directed by Sam Mendes, we see Daniel Craig play 007 once again. James Bond is tested by determining his loyalty to M after being attacked. Bond get's involved in a bunch of other threats that make this a pretty typical Bond film. Javier Bardem plays the villain excellently. The plot isn't too unique. Basically you have James Bond fighting villains, getting help along the way, meeting women, being betrayed by his boss and shooting his gun. If your a fan of James Bond, you'll adore 'Skyfall.' What's kind of nice about this particular James Bond film is that you do not need to know a single thing about James Bond and you'll be able to pick up on the story immediately. Sam Mendes is one of the best directors out there these days. He gives great intensity to the film and will definitely please Bond fans. The editing and sound is superb of course, and Daniel Craig is pretty sweet as James Bond. Another thing I enjoyed was how 'Skyfall' had new themes of James Bond films, and was very modernized but yet kept some traditional aspects of older, classic Bond films. The reason i can only give this a 2.5/4 is because I'm not a James Bond fan. These films just are not for me. 'Skyfall' looked very entertaining, and it will be if you like James Bond, however I still wasn't intrigued. If your a Bond fan, go see this film. If not, see something else.",Null,0,2,15 June 2014
It," Stephen King's adapted classic is a refreshing installment in the horror genre.
","The evil clown Pennywise returns to the little town of Darry, Maine to feast on children and their fears. Stephen King's bestselling horror classic 'It' is truly a brilliant piece of horror storytelling. Not only is this story grounded in its characters rather than its plot, but it's a genuinely original take on fear itself. The Losers Club deals with tough childhoods which become worse when Pennywise starts terrifying them and slowly hunts them down. Together they team up to destroy this scary bastard, and boy are there scares throughout the journey. Pennywise is truly terrifying and 'It' knows how and when to scare the living daylights out of the audience. This is a refreshing film because it steers away from traditional brutality in modern day horror films and gives the audiences kids to care about. It's character invested, not scares-invested. There are plenty of 'jump out of your seat' moments that catch you off guard, but the kids playing the Losers are all perfectly cast and give the audience people to root for. 'It' is truly horrifying, entertainment at its purest and most classic form. This is the kind of film going in you'll be afraid of, but going out you'll be pleasantly surprised about receiving something more than just a few needless scares.",Null,1,1,19 December 2017
Hereditary," 'Hereditary' is one of the most chilling and haunting horror dramas ever made.
","It says a lot about a film when at multiple times thro8hgout the film you have to literally catch your breath and your heart starts beating rapidly, desperately anticipating the next scene while also terrified at what's yet to come. So is the case with Ari Aster's ingenious 'Hereditary,' a film so effective and haunting due to its shockingly realistic scares and troubling subject matter.What makes this film work so well is how it sticks with you and stays in your mind. Aster, in his first feature, knows how to make movies and knows how to get a proper reaction out of his audience. Using a dm3eomnic cult with a spirit demon that haunts a family is only half the freight- what's really troubling is how 'hereditary' makes us look into the dysfunction and unhealthy dynamics of a truly broken family.Toni Collette gives the performance of a lifetime in what is arguably the greatest performance in a horror movie of all time. Her emotion, facial expression, subtle nuances, and ability to get her audience to care so much for her character without truly knowing that much about it speaks volumes about her skill level.'Hereditary' grabs you and refuses to let go. Ari Aster directs this film with so much power and terror that subtlety and creatively tears a part of you. A masterpiece of modern horror and a testament to the horrors of reality, 'Hereditary' is truly haunting and one of the best films of 2018.",Null,2,3,4 January 2019
Casablanca," One of America's most iconic pictures.
","'Casablanca' is a truly classic American picture. Michael Curtiz takes us to an important time in history at the time during WW II where Rick Blaine, who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco, discovers his old flame Ilsa is in town with her husband, Victor Laszlo. Laszlo is a resistance leader from Czechoslovakia, and with Germans on his tail, Ilsa knows Rick can help them get out of the country. This historical icon with stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman is a testament of love and international affairs. Few classics can be so engaging and historically vivid like 'Casablanca.' This film is still talked about to this day not only due to the historical Hollywood icons that lead the film, but for its portrayal of important Americans in a foreign land who come across dangerous obstacles.",Null,0,3,14 August 2016
Training Day," A classic crime film with legendary performances.
","Temptation and falling down the wrong path can end a long streak of devastation and horrendous outcomes. 'Training Day' reflects a day in the lives of two L.A. cops who both lead into two different directions. Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is a new police officer with a great heart and string conscience who starts his first day with experienced and dirty police officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Alonzo takes Jake into the brutal and corrupt crime world of L.A., which causes Jake to question his morals, his opinion on Alonzo, and what line in life he will be headed for. The two are faced with many experiences that are both used in a way to train them, but not all experiences will be responded to wisely. Denzel Washington gives an absolutely gritty and flawless performance who swears better and yells louder than any actor out their. His 'gangsta' attitude is not overdone or forced at all, and provides entertainment from just watching this lion roar. Ethan Hawke is also brilliant as a wide-eyed cop turned determined warrior who always seems like a new character in every scene. Director Antoine Fuqua portrays the dark world of L.A. perfectly with amazing action sequences and a setting that looks like hell. Filled with criminals, drugs, and violence, you see some of the most disturbing landscapes in the history of film that will make you nervous from just watching. David Ayer's script is a monumental work of art. Filled with rich dialog and interesting characters, he takes a simple plot and turns it into a moral compass for doing what's right and not giving in. 'Training Day' is one of the greatest cop films of all time and can be used as a template for making and developing a story about good and bad.",Null,2,3,5 July 2014
In Bruges," Return to the genre of the witty crime film.
","You know you have a great film when you can reflect on moral issues and blend kick-ass action with pitch-perfect original writing at the same time. Martin McDonagh's 'In Bruges' is an instant classic, a kind of film that's enjoyable throughout and delivers all the great jabs of a black comedy. Guilt-stricken after a job gone wrong, hit-man Ray (Colin Farrell) and his partner Ken (Brendan Gleeson) await orders from their ruthless boss in Bruges, Belgium, the last place in the world Ray wants to be. Colin Ferrell and Brendan Gleeson are a acting duo from heaven. Bopth men give stellar performances of men facing mid-life crisis' who end up getting themselves in a hell of a lot more than they bargained for. Gleeson and Ferrell makes every scene entertaining, and do it with the kind of natural talent than few actors posses. Martin McDonagh's script is filled with original content that stays grounded in certain themes, but is liberal in what it'll do to the audience. It's the kind of film that you shake your head all throughout, but will walk out of with a grin on your face due to the richness and keen originality that you barely get to see in movies these days.",Null,1,1,7 February 2016
Chinatown," 'Chinatown' has too many flaws, making it one of the most overrated films of all time.
","Crime films tend to cast the largest spells on viewers who seek a compilation of many gritty, lurid, enthralling emotions and characters. 'Chinatown' is one of the most highly praised films of all time. I couldn't tell you why. I must have looked at my clock ten times every thirty minutes to count down when this dry, low- energy crime film would end. Many film 'experts' state that some of the greatest films of all time I will go as forth to say that this is one of the most wasted talent examples in cinematic history. The plot writer Robert Towne has created contains all the ingredients for a perfect neo-noir mind-bender. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private detective who is hired by Evelyn Mulwray when she suspects her husband Hollis, builder of the city's water supply system, of having an affair. Gittes does what he does best and photographs him with a young girl but in the ensuing scandal, it seems he was hired by an impersonator and not the real Mrs. Mulwray. Jake is plunged into a complex web of deceit involving murder and municipal corruption all related to the city's water supply. If this film had strong energy we would be dazzled. Instead, Roman Polanski directs this in a very bland fashion. We get no soothing music to fit the setting that could have shined if we weren't stuck with minimalist costumes and production. There's a couple cool cars, that's it in terms of production design. Every actor barely locks into their characters. We get dragged out performances with out any spice. With so much mystery, deceit, and complexity, we would assume that being at the edge of our seats would be easy with this classic. Sadly you have to pay extremely close attention to absorb every tiny detail Polanski throws at you. It gets too confusing and not thrilling enough. There's nothing noir about it. All 'Chinatown' does is show an early example of underachieving crime filmmaking with barely any focus on it's main idea- corruption.",Null,3,5,21 November 2014
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga shine in this powerful and inspiring drama.
","If you had told me that I would have cried at a movie starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in 2018 a few years ago, I would have laughed. The two A-list stars have done something nothing short of iconic in Cooper's directorial debut in A Star Is Born. This is the fourth feature with this title, first appearing in 1937, followed by the 1954 version starring Judy Garland, and then later followed in 1976 with Barbra Streisand. Remaking a film for the fourth time's a risky move, even by mainstream Hollywood's standards. Luckily, Bradley Cooper does it perfectly, creating a film that will be talked about for decades. 
 Bradley Cooper directs himself in the lead role as Jackson Maine, a drug addicted alcoholic who happens to be a famous musician. Despite his career success, his life is haunted by his troubled past and his addictions. It comes as no surprise that our male protagonist meets a woman who changes his life. It sounds like a familiar tune (no pun intended), yet what Cooper does is different. Casting the talented and world famous Lady Gaga as Maine's partner Ally, a struggling waitress who's looking for a breakthrough into the music business, the two characters form a passionate relationship that transports both of them musically and spiritually. 
 Few first time directors are as talented as Bradley Cooper. Within the first five minutes of the film we're easily aware that this talented actor has a gifted eye for storytelling and the craft of filmmaking. The only issue with this talent of Cooper's is that it's easy to miss due to his magnificent performance. Few actors are capable of captivating audiences with such an authentic and rich character portrayal as Cooper does in A Star Is Born. He presents a man traumatized emotionally and gives us a raw, natural look at the human condition and the desire for belonging and change. 
 Bradley Cooper's performance is especially terrific due to his chemistry with Lady Gaga. The two actors complement each other beautifully, their characters and performances growing with the audience in a nuanced and artful fashion. Gaga sings better than ever in her entire career in this film, most notably in her duet with Cooper titled Shallow, which has already become a popular song before the film has even been released. It's hands down one of cinema's best original songs to date. Gaga's musical talent is contagious. Her powerful voice and unscathed emotions while performing is the stuff stars of made of. Her acting, however, may even be better than her singing. Few actors can act so naturally and impact the audience in such an effective way as Gaga does here. Expect the singer and dancer to be in more films as a serious actor. 
 The singing and acting is beautiful and terrific, yet what hits home the hardest is the fresh and powerful story. Few films allow us as viewers to care so much and relate to people who, even though might be famous musicians, we can identify with and root for to succeed and overcome their obstacles. Stories in general are there for us to connect with, which is what this film excels at marvelously. It's an unexpected gem that is simply not to be missed.",Null,32,67,4 October 2018
Gravity," 'Gravity' is visually historical and contains beautiful artistic vision.
","Most visual focused films are nothing but visuals that have lame plots. Alfonso Cuaron instead makes you feel like your drifting in space in a historically mesmerizing way. The plot is very simple. Sandra Bullock plays a space engineer who's work goes completely wrong after a solar flare causing her to drift around in space and find her way back to earth. Even though the film isn't realistic, it still is one of the greatest works of art in terms of visual aspects. The visual aspects of film making enforced in 'Gravity' is nothing more than amazing. On top of that you have interesting characters with strong symbols and messages. What's fun about 'Gravity' is that it is entertaining and beautiful. It shows us how cinema has evolved and shows us new ways of film making. The awe I experienced while viewing this motion picture still stays with me and makes me appreciate just how brilliant visual artists can be. Many will say that having a film with just all visuals and no strong themes is pointless. While that can be absolutely true, 'Gravity' is not an example of that kind of film. 'Gravity' instead is a visual work of art that has themes such as persistence, importance, remediation, and sacrifice that audiences can be moved by as well. If your dream is to someday travel to space, don't waste your time, just see this film.",Null,1,4,2 June 2014
Lone Survivor," 'Lone Survivor' exhilarates and hits hard and home.
","Most of the time war movies use the bogus excuse of honoring our soldiers to show non-stop violence and explosions. Lone Survivor' gets a little carried away with the action, but it truly does honor the brave men and women who sacrifice for our great country. Directing the he best war film since 'The Hurt Locker,' Peter Berg reenacts the Operations Red Wings mission in Afghanistan of 2005 where four Navy Seals were to investigate an area where a highly notorious Taliban leader was seating his army. Little did they known there were over two-hundred Taliban they had to face off one by one. Mark Wahlberg in one of his best performances plays real life Navy Seal Marcus Lutrell. Lutrell is a highly determined body of persistence who will do anything to save his brothers. In polarizing warfare scenes shot beautifully with furious energy and depth, Peter Berg reminds us that the ultimate sacrifice Navy Seals give is truly rigorous and relentless. With devastating acting by Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Taylor Kitsch, we experience a gruesome battle with entertaining and intense combat that tests the morals and diligence of four honorable and brave human beings. Berg fills the screen with exciting sights and sounds tied in with overwhelming intensity. Despite the highly fantasized outcome of the operation and the added in extras to add some spice to the pot, we still get a clear perspective of what Lutrell and his team went through. With moral questions to provoke the mind and shocking detail on brutal warfare, 'Lone Survivor' hits hard and pays tribute to those that serve our country.",Null,0,1,21 February 2015
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts is hilarious and deep in 'Erin Brokovich.'
","The individuals who make a difference in society are the ones who's get big actors and actresses to play them in films. Erin Brokivch was one woman who made a great difference on our environment. Brockovich is an unemployed single mother, troubling to find a job. Erin also failed a lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully convinces her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one understands her, with her trashy clothes and outgoing words, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. What she discovers is that the company is trying to buy land that was contaminated by a deadly toxic waste that the company is illegally dumping and, in turn, poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her law-firm in one of the biggest lawsuits in American history. Julia Roberts does great acting by playing this warrior of a woman. She shows different sides of Brokovich while bringing her bravery to life. Julia Roberts is both hilarious and deep by showing what being a struggling person is like. The determination she endures in this role helps bring her characters personality to life. A great role! Steven Soderbergh does a fun job of directing by making this film both enjoyable and moving. He uses the best of his abilities in each shot and brings a true story back to life in different settings and environments. The whole look of this film is so realistic, from the cooperation's to her trashy houses, it's a true story brought to life remarkably. Much credit is given to Susannah Grant fro making a great story that touches something true. I would have liked the film to be a bit shorter and not focus so much on Erin Brokovich's life before the law case. Her character can get a bit irritating at times, but is remarkable for the most part. I also would have liked it to be much more dramatic to really show the gravity of the situation. 'Erin Brokovich' is a bold true story that shows social bravery and corruption.",Null,0,0,13 September 2014
The Big Lebowski," Coens Cult flop.
","I get why people gravitate towards the Coens' 'Big Lebowski.' It has a certain appeal that you don't find every day in movies. While most say it has a profound wit and originality that makes it special, I say 'The Big Lebowski' is an overdone and forced film relied heavily on its weak script. 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Birdges), mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski, seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it. With help from John Goodman as The Dude's crazy friend, 'The Big Lebowski' stays away from complete failure. The film never strives to do anything but portray a goofy crime story that we've seen hundreds of times. Not one performance feels witty or unique, and the direction has zero creative input by the Coen brothers. The Coens are masterful filmmakers, there's no question. It's just that this film is their big flop that everyone still liked. This is perhaps the most overrated movie of all time, and I don't say that lightly.",Null,7,14,21 February 2016
Star Trek," Trekies died of excitement for something not too exciting.
","Remakes of some of the biggest franchises of all time lack a certain rhythm that forms a pattern of chemistry. 'Star Trek' formed the basis of one of the most popular TV programs of all time and gave way to some big blockbusters throughout the 20th century. 'Lost' producer, J.J. Abrams, gives the 'Star Trek' franchise a visual upbeat by directing first class stuntmen and visual effects teams to whip up consistently stunning visuals when Abrams decides to use them./ Abrams focuses too much on the boring emotional struggles between some of the most ridiculous sci-fi characters t date. Captain Kirk and Commander Spock take the screen and are the main focus throughout the remake, like in every other 'Star Trek' screen work. With about three 'Star Trek' fans writing the script, 'Star Trek' still feels like a routine get together to reinvent a story that feels like a routine tour with everyone going through the motions to try and surprise and remind Trekies about the glory of this praised franchise. On the day of James Kirk's (Chris Pine) birth, his father dies on his ship in a last stand against a mysterious alien time-traveling vessel looking for Ambassador Spock (Zachary Quinto), who, in this time, is also a child on Vulcan disdained by his neighbors for his half-human heritage. Twenty-five years later, Kirk has grown into a young troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy instructors like young Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. I have never been a 'Star Trek' fan, but multiple sources say Abrams honors old 'Star Trek' entertainment while trying something new simultaneously. I was bored to tears by this one. Abrams focuses more on the emotional story and sets us up for probably three more films to come while not taking advantage of his ability to create stunning visuals.",Null,0,2,27 December 2014
Fury," Brad Pitt leads his team into his second round of Nazi ass-kicking.
","In 'Inglorious Bastards' we saw Brad Pitt lead a team on war-men into a violent fight against Nazis during WW II. That's pretty much all he does again in 'Fury.' This isn't your 'Saving Private Ryan' like war film, but more of a fun action film with spectacular sound and editing that triggers exceptional war scenes and a lot of dead Nazis. Brad Pitt gives an overdone performance as Wardaddy, a southern commander who leads his tank and four men into enemy lines throughout Nazi-occupied Euoper. The entire film features awesome war scenes with multiple explosions and machine gun fires, but never does anything else. 'Fury' is handled well by director David Ayer because he stays clear on what his purpose is. He doesn't overdo his film, but instead creates a terrific and unrealistic action film set in WW II. Nothing more, nothing less.",Null,12,23,24 December 2015
Fight Club," 'Fight Club' is a wild ride with an important theme of our violent society ! You won't know what hit you!
","We live in a violent society. We are influenced by violence, but the way we respond and react to it varies. 'Fight Club' received controversy for its violent plot, but the people complaining do not see it's characteristics and message. Edward Norton plays an unnamed narrator who suffers from insomnia and is requested by his doctor that he go to a support group for help. The narrator meets and observes Marla, a quirky and mysterious woman played and cast perfectly by Helan Bonham Carter. After seeing his apartment destroyed, the narrator lives with Tyler Durden (a crazy Brad Pitt) who he met on a business trip. Dudrden sells soap. The two create a club called fight club that involves nothing but brutal fights. As the influence on their fight club becomes more and more popular, many other clubs are formed that are inspired by fight club to represent the influence of violence in America. As things erupt, the relationship between the narrator and Tyler becomes increasingly dangerous and out of control. Tyler Durden represents violence in general, and the narrator represents America. We are so vulnerable to violent influences that we end up being wrapped up into it. The title 'Fight Club' indeed is a title for America.We also get the theme of simple people and how they deal with their low social status and weaknesses. Tyler Durden eventually rises up to authority while the narrator lives his miserable life the same way. This bizarre and widely unique film shouldn't be condemned at all. It should be praised for its artistic talent and strong social themes involving the influence of violence. Director David Fincher handles this film beautifully. He gives such a bizarre nature to 'Fight Club' that it becomes weird and dream- like. The visual aspects are well handled and gives us a hard-hitting knockout of a film that will leave you speechless and confused. Brad Pitt's character of Tyler Durden is what really raises my attention. Durden is so out of control and crazy that you forget your watching pretty boy Brad Pitt. He wraps you up in his character and makes you feel as confused and curious as Edward Norton's character the narrator. Norton plays the part perfectly and fulfills the need for this role. 'Fight Club' can be widely entertaining and fun at times, but is mainly used in order to give us a wake up call for how violent we are and how vulnerable we are as Americans to harmful influences. Twist and turns and bizarre behavior provide a shockingly unique film that should go down in history as important and kick-ass. You wont know what hit you!",Null,0,2,21 July 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino creates a massively original time-piece and literally changes history in 'Inglourious Basterds.'
","It's very daring for talented filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino to make violent films that can turn out controversial and change historical facts in them, but get the result of an amazing film. QT creates 'Inglourious Basterds', spelled wrong on purpose and about a group of American Secret service men called the Basterds who kill Nazi's during WW II. Lt. Aldo Raine is the leader of the group, a militant American who has no mercy for the Nazi cowards. Raine is played hilariously by Brad Pitt. 'Inglourious Basterds' has a million sub-plots. Christoph Waltz is a high-ranking German who ends up interacting with the bastards and is surprisingly funny and likable, which is realistic. Out of their evil work, the Nazi's were normal people which is Tarantino's point. A young Jew also tries to get revenge against the Nazi's as well for murdering her friends and family in the opening scene, which is as riveting as any cinematic experience you'll ever see. This WW II film has Hitler and history changed in unimaginable ways outside Quentin Tarantino's brilliant mind. Tarantino's originality in not only this masterpiece, but his other works is so unique and sophisticated that it should be cherished in the art world. His directing is great as well, giving us great shots and creative visuals that make the film unique visually as well. The other aspects such as editing, cinematography, production and costume design help this creative gem become even realer, and believable. Not a second in this film is goofy to the point that it feels like a spoof. Tarantino makes every scene believable to the point that it gets weird. The film has hilarious scenes, to depressing and riveting scenes that make your blood curl, to absolutely heart-pounding action that make this masterpiece and instant classic and one of Quentin Tarantino's true works of art.",Null,0,0,24 June 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 'Rogue One' is an interesting and well-made installment to the Star Wars universe
","While it does feel like 'Star Wars' is being carried out a little too much and there seems to be a new film ever six months, 'Rogue One' is a very interesting installment. Taking place before 'A New Hope,' this film follows the special team of Resistance fighters who worked to find the information to weaken the Death Star and allow future fighters to destroy the spacecraft and topple the Empire. This film does a Jie job of staying centered and having a central plot with characters that are both fun and rewarding to the audience. Any 'Star Wars' fan will appreciate this rollercoaster of a sci-fi movie and will get a kick out of the spectacular visual effects and awesome battle sequences. 'Rogue One' is thought out very well and full of Easter eggs that 'Star Wars' fans will love. So much could have gone wrong with this film, yet it succeeds wonderfully.",Null,0,2,3 February 2018
This Is the End," A ridiculously good time!
","Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Jay Barachaul, Danny McBride, and James Franco trapped in a house in the end of the world- JACKPOT! When you watch a comedy film you want to have a good time and have fun. 'This is the End' is that on steroids. Every scene in this film is absolutely hilarious and couldn't have asked for a better cast to make this one ridiculously good time. Seth Rogen is his normal self playing a typical Seth Rogen character. He's great. Jonah Hill steals the show as playing a sensitive, nice, and cocky version of himself. Jay Barachaul is the guy who isn't funny in order to keep the simple plot in line. James Franco is funny as sort of a jerky guy and Craig Robinson is just hilarious as the wimpy, big guy who has great lines. But McBride is the one who will make you go 'he did not just do that.' Everything that comes out of his mouth makes your guts hurt almost as hard as Jonah Hill's screen time. Having fun with a comedy is a great way to enjoy film.

World War Z," Come on, really?
","There are a few sci-fi films that are not just mayhem and action. There are sci-fi films that contain mayhem, action, and stupidity. World War Z is about an ex United Nations worker (Brad Pitt) who embarks on a mission to find a way to save the world from the current zombie apocalypse. World War Z has a couple of intense scenes, but for the most part it gets repetitive. Not a single character is interesting or well- acted, the action is minimal, and the ending is ridiculous. The film gets to the point where it is so fast pace that it fells like the zombie apocalypse lasted an hour before the climax. The visual effects is nothing we haven't seen, causing disappointment in my review. The thing that drove me crazy in this film is that it didn't keep any sense of reality at all. In films with impossible plots like in 'World War Z' it is good to keep a least some sense of reality. It doesn't! The film moves so fats, the events that occur during action sequences are ridiculous, and the whole solution in the story is laughable. Don't be expecting a film with great zombies, instead they look like normal people. It's great to have a popcorn film once and a while, but at least see one that is somewhat good and not ridiculous.",Null,0,2,5 June 2014
The Hunger Games," 'The Hunger games' is a story revolving around unrealistic child heroes and a ridiculous story.
","Children can be great heroes when put in realistic situations. 'The Hunger Games' is a series so big in America, that it may even become the biggest of all time. The film is a very poor story, and did nothing to make the characters feel real, or even have a story that wasn't complete garbage fantasy. The Hunger Games' tells a futuristic story about different games called the hunger games that are held annually and are similar to the Olympics. The games are not monopoly and hopscotch, but kids killing each other until one survives only. A few kids from each district of the separated people are chosen to participate in these games. Katniss Everdeen is the main character who volunteers for the hunger games over her little sister. She is an excellent survivor and is very clever. She befriends Peeta, who is in her same district which will lead to some further difficult decisions. Jennifer Larence as Katniss din't do the best job at playing Katniss. She just wasn't believable and was a very boring actor and character. The film making aspects were minimally done to make the visual aspects very disappointing. The main fault in this story is that children are the heroes. Kids is action stories are horrendous leaders, and are unrealistic at making sense to the story. Kids in stories that involve struggles and difficulties that kids actually face are much more powerful. In The Hunger Games' you have a teenage girl that is as fake as cookies and orange juice acting like Alexander the Great when she really should be portraying a girl with difficulties of a teenager that others can see as inspirations to help with adolescents.",Null,2,4,18 June 2014
Mississippi Burning," 'Mississippi Burning' is one of the best films of all time!
","Racism in the 1960's was an absolute abundant and devastating part of American history that caused some of the worst tragedies known to mankind. Luckily, there were brave FBI agents who tried to take down the villains responsible for the heinous acts done by a popular group known as the KKK. Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman star as FBI agents who investigate a murder on a civil rights activist in a racist southern town and find out that there different styles of work can lead to justice if they persevere. The two men meet with different people in order to help there case, one of the agents even falls in love with a KKK member's wife and danger erupts due to the popularity of racism acting on the agents to prevent prison. The dramatic scenes involving racist acts towards African-Americans are so powerful and well-handled that you'll feel saddened for weeks. Some of the most graphic racial dialogue and slurs are stated with realistic KKK members and a 1960's looking town give 'Mississippi Burning' a perfect portrayal of prejudice America. Director Alan Parker shoots this film in a beautiful yet tragic way in which ever film artist working on the project seems so caught up in there work that you'll be nuts not to appreciate. Writer Chris Gerolmo does a great job at keeping a multilateral plot with compelling crime scenes and a deep investigation, to honoring victims of racism by showing dramatic scenes and getting a great supporting cast. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe play their different characters beautifully, where Gene Hackman is more of an old school down to business detective, and Willem Dafoe plays a more clean and honest agent committed to helping others. 'Mississippi Burning' is one of those films that reflect a sad time in America, but can still touch upon great drama and hope to bring one of the best films ever made.",Null,1,2,2 August 2014
Argo," 'Argo' is a historical film done wonderfully and truthfully.
","In 1979 many Iranians stormed the U.S. embassy due to the United Sates taking the shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi into their country to treat him. The Iranian revolution was intended to take the shah out of power due to corruption and poor leadership. As a result of Iranians overthrowing the U.S. embassy, six Americans were taken hostage causing the U.S. to respond with a plan. C.I.A. agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) lead an operation in which he would fly to Tehran,Iran to pose as a Hollywood film producer filming a science-fiction film called Argo in Iran. The plan was to meet up with the six hostages and make them pose as filmmakers such as a director, editor, costume designer etc. Mendez took many preparations for this mission which includes making a fake production company, creating a film story, and making tough travel arrangements. Screenwriter Chris Terrio covers almost every part of this incredible true story beautifully. He shows the other agents and diplomats responsible for coming up with the plan and how ti was taken into action. He shows Tony Mendez's travel, work, and family life superbly that make it more than just a true story that is all about 'this happened first, then that, then this, then that, the end.' The scenes where Mendez gets the hostages and has to leave Iran is so intense you'll freak, even knowing how the film mends due to being a true story. One thing director/producer Ben Affleck does that is daring is fantasizing a little detail towards the end for dramatic play. The scene doesn't ruin the truth of the story in the slightest, instead makes the film intense and extra special. The film making aspects and acting are great, and the production design takes you deep into the story like it were real.'Argo' is a true story film with fascinating history that is stylized to make it intense and interesting so it isn't like your reading a dang history book.",Null,0,2,16 June 2014

I absolutely appreciated the artistic talent the stunt and visual effects team did on this film, but its the plot that I can't enjoy for two seconds.

But hey, if you want to see some cool visuals then this film isn't that bad, it just doesn't do anything else after 20 minutes of seeing the same explosions and glass break. Nothing original here!

"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," The perfect touch of sap and heart.
","Steve Carell has the comedic charm to turn any ordinary film into a marvelous delight. He does so again in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love,' a film that captures the essence of modern day relationships through utter truth and over the top 'yeah rights.' What writer Dan Fogelman has done is taken a traditional love story and turn it into a not only consistently entertaining and funny film, but an interesting look at the reality of relationships that combine perfectly with fictitious scenarios. A middle-aged husband named Cal's (Carell) life changes dramatically when his wife (Julianne Moore) asks him for a divorce. He seeks to rediscover his manhood with the help of a new-found friend, Jacob (Ryan Gosling), learning to pick up girls at bars. Gosling and Carell have a hilarious chemistry that punctures the capability of unlikely allies. Emma Stone has room for playing a confused lady in love with Jacob. Then the crazy happens, causing everyone to bring the worst out of each other and every fictional feel-good moment after the other to come pouring out. So what!

Us," Jordan Peele adds another gift to the horror genre.
","The horror genre has more appreciated within the last decade or so, with films like IT, The Witch, A Quiet Place, Get Out and The Babadook being able to terrify audiences while simultaneously examining important topics surrounding human nature.Jordan Peele's Get Out from 2017 was a film that so creatively examined racial tensions in the United States and gripped us to our cores that we'll be analyzing the film for decades. Peele, in his second feature, crafts a film similar in style and energy, yet grounds is film around different societal themes that are executed just as profoundly in Us, a monumental piece of cinema that is a gift to the horror genre.Us follows the story of a family vacationing in Santa Cruz, California, visiting the same ebach that the mother of the family and the film's protagonist Adelaide (Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o) visited as a child, where she encountered a doppelgänger, better known as an exact clone of herself. Adelaide explains this to her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) before their family is hunted and terrorized by not only Adelaide's doppelgänger clone, but the clones of their entire family of four.Peele proves yet again that he's more than a silly comedian, who on his Comedy Central sketch show Key & Peele became one of the country's most beloved comedic talents. Not only is Peele a master on building tension and suspense, he requires his audience to pay attention and commit to being fully immersed in detecting the rich depth his unusual and creative conflicts exert.With Us, Peele isn't focusing on race relations, but rather society and humanity as a whole. Us demands we reflect on how different environments produce different people, how the past influences the present, and who we truly are as a society. It becomes evident that there are subtle plot references to American history and the current state of American society. Peele wants his audience to contemplate how we view the other, whatever that may be to each individual. In dealing with a family facing the violent duplicates of themselves, Peele goes further as a storyteller and delivers a full-throttle suspense thriller that leaves us thinking well-after we exit the theatre.Complementing this layered story is the tremendous filmmaking style that Peele seems to have grown comfortable with. Similar to Get Out, most notably the 'sunken place' scene, Us has a number of visually arresting shots and sequences that give the film a gorgeous style. Filled with vivid imagery that evokes metaphorical visual storytelling, Us is a directorial powerhouse.Lupita Nyong'o does wonders in playing two roles, one as the protective and troubled mother Adelaide and the other as the strange and dangerous clone of herself. Despite her strong performance, Nyong'o could have been cast differently and may be hard to connect with audiences. Despite being 36 years old, Nyong'o looks very young, making it hard for the audience to identify her as a mother due to looking like she could be the older sister of the kids who she's suppose to be the mother of. Her perfrances are splendid, yet this isn't a role that only she could play. Winston Duke does a great job of adding just the right amount of comedic relief and acting genuinely confused and surprised as the terror and action unfolds. Both kids give stand-out performances and promise further acting careers.Perhaps what makes Us work so well is how Peele is able to use the influences that inspired him to be a filmmaker like Alfred Hitchcock while also being able to craft a fresh and original film that belongs solely to him as an artist. Peele is a gifted director with brilliant visions that define his own trademark. We're truly lucky to live in a time when Jordan Peele is directing movies, for each time he proves that he is in fact much more than a comedian and one of the most profound storytellers of our generation.",Null,2,9,23 March 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," 'Prince of Persia' feels so lousy that it isn't even likable by visual means.
","The worst turn in the talented young actor Jake Gyllenhaal's career is a summer movie so lousy, so ridiculous, and so horribly acted that even the eye-popping visuals seem withdrawn. The Arab-like setting in 'Prince of Persia' is very stereotypical and hardly shows a historic culture fused with fantasy. We've all seen stories like this before. This is like the live-action 'Aladdin' with no heart and music. A young fugitive prince named Dastan (Gyllenhaal) and princess must stop a villain who unknowingly threatens to destroy the world with a special dagger that enables the magic sand inside to reverse time. Overboard on the fantasy? There have been legends like this in Persian history that make zero sense and are completely absurd. That shows you how foolish the filmmakers were in making this. 'Prince of Persia' is your routine summer action film from a studio who produces some pretty big blockbusters. Mike Newell directs this with an overly-vibrant colors and sets that are so obviously CGI and look recycled from other films. Gyllenhaal needs to stay away from scum like this containing laughable dialogue and do more powerful dramas like he's best at. You live you learn there Jake. By the climax, we know how this film will play almost word for word taking out the fun from the action that barely comes and is barely exciting. Gee, I wonder if the protagonist is gonna make the huge jump in order to save the world? That's the question you'll have to ask yourself during the poorly edited and shot action sequences.

Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett, a car dealership worker who at a young boy received a magical teddy bear as a Christmas gift. Now he's in his thirties and still has the teddy bear, only they both switched from sweet and cute to lazy, rude, and rambunctious. The two are best buddies and are absolute bums. Ted is voiced by MacFarlane and constantly smokes pot, makes jokes, and is a total bum. The plot moves from just pure fun and games to a little melodramatic due to John having a relationship with a woman named Laurie, who is played sweetly funny by Mila Kunis. This film is a total party. It's a great film to just enjoy and laugh your face off at 2:00 A.M. MacFarlane is even more raunchy and vulgar than his characters are in family guy, and is absolutely hilarious as Ted. Mark Wahlberg is hilarious as well, and him and Ted have a great buddy relationship. The main factor that makes this comedy so special is the originality. Most comedies these days have the same recycled jokes and plots that they become repulsive and not funny. 'Ted' is pure comedy creativity that makes a great time and has lots of fun laughs and outrageous scenarios that make this the ultimate popcorn comedy film.",Null,0,1,16 June 2014
Knives Out," Rian Johnson crafts an original murder mystery that ranks as one of the most enjoybale films of 2019
","We haven't had a great murder mystery whodunnit film in an extremely long time. While a well-known genre and plot, writer/director Rian Johnson has reinvented the genre with his fresh new take 'Knives Out.'Taking place primarily in an elaborate and old house in the countryside out east, quirky detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) investigates the death of the matriarch of a dysfunctional, combative family by the name of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), suspecting that one of them likely murdered him.Caught in the middle of the family conflict along with Benoit is Harlan's housemaid Marta (Ana de Armas), a good-hearted and wide-eyed young lady uncomfortable and uneasy with the whole situation. Each member of the family stands out due to their distinctive unique characteristics. Each actor embodies their characters' strong and combative personalities yet gives their trademark to their performances. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, and Christopher Plummer are all at the tip of their games and deliver fun and energetic performances, yet its Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig who steals the show.De Armas captures the stress and anxiety of her fragile persona and is the closest thing there is to a protagonist in this star-studded mystery. The actress is sensational in capturing emotions through her rich facial expressions, yet what she does best is to generate empathy from the audience and make us take her side amongst the array of selfish, rude characters.Daniel Craig is an actor best known for playing the straight-faced and serious James Bond, yet seeing him speak in a cartoonish southern-bayou accent and have a genuinely fun presence is a true treat. Craig is overdoing it with his accent, yet that's the point. He's able to portray a traditional southern detective like in most murder mysteries but at the same time gives his spin through his charismatic personality.Rian Johnson does a great job of setting up the mystery and making us think that virtually any of these characters could have committed the murder, making us as an audience consistently think on our feet. We get to go down several twists and turns that consistently keep us engaged and cognizant, making the film a prime form of entertainment.'Knives Out' could have used a more shocking or climactic ending, yet the film is by far one of 2019s most entertaining films. This film may be classified as a good old fashion whodunnit murder mystery, but thanks to Johnson's witty writing and detail-oriented direction, it becomes something else. The director excels at keeping his audience engaged throughout and trusts his viewers to pay attention to key clues and call-backs, making it impossible to be bored.'Knives Out' is a film that several different audiences can enjoy and one with so much going for it that should not be missed.",Null,1,3,29 December 2019
The Irishman," Scorsese's 'The Irishman' is an epic chronicle of crime
","One of 2019's biggest and most anticipated films, 'The Irishman' seemed too good to be true when the project was originally announced. Not only was it to be directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, but the director would bring together screen legends Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci in a film that sounded dreamlike for fans of mob films and the crime genre.Scorsese has shined once again and has crafted a film that elevates the senses. While he may not be a fan of Marvel movies, there's no denying we're witnessing the work of a master. Expect 'The Irishman' to be a leading contender for numerous awards.Scorsese's latest is instinctually being compared to his former crime works such as 'Goodfellas,' 'The Departed' and 'Casino,' yet with 'The Irishman' Scorsese has done a unique job in crafting a picture unlike anything he's ever done yet still manages to incorporate touches of his artistic style that made him so internationally acclaimed in the first place. We have several engaging tracking shots that the filmmaker is prone to for us to engage with the setting and experience the characters' sights and surroundings as well as spectacular slow-motion sequences that allow us as an audience to view the intimate details and gravity of certain situations.What distinguishes 'The Irishman' from not only Scorsese's past work in the crime genre but the vast majority of mafia films is the style Scorsese approaches. While 'Goodfellas,' 'The Departed' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' contained constant excitement and riveting intensity, 'The Irishman' follows a subtler, more nuanced approach and is more of a character study that examines more crucial topics of the human condition. Instead of every scene being filled with tension, intensity, or conflict, 'The Irishman' takes its time and strives to let the audience understand everything there is to possibly know about the characters, letting us study their faces and get inside their heads so that we can eventually predict what they're going to say before they open their mouths.An adaptation of the narrative nonfiction book 'I Heard You Paint Houses' by Charles Brandt, 'The Irishman' chronicles the life of Frank Sheeran (De Niro), a truck driver and WWII veteran who ends up working as an assassin for Philadelphia mob boss Russell 'Russ' Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Both Bufalino and Sheeran grow close and have mutual respect, the two's relationship one of the most intriguing elements of the film. Sheeran takes out whoever he's asked with no questions, his lifestyle becoming robotic as he gradually falls apart from his four daughters.Sheeran soon starts working with famed union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) as his bodyguard, who he meets due to Hoffa's financial ties to the Bufalino Crime Family. Frank Sheeran is most notable for being the alleged man who killed Jimmy Hoffa after confessing, for to this day no one truly knows what caused Hoffa to vanish in 1975. The film explores at length the two's relationships and, without spoiling anything, examines the eventual despair and repercussions of their connection.The film digs deep into the rich history of Hoffa and his feud with the Kennedy family. Scorsese examines the secretive acts of corruption that both politicians and mobsters orchestrated to shape vital policy in the United States. We get to follow Hoffa's influential political career and his tension with both President John F. Kennedy and his younger brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Hoffa's constant quest for power through Sheeran's point of view, making the film excel as a narrative.While Hoffa is no doubt committed to working people and his union, power is his underlying motivation throughout the film. Sheeran, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have much motivation throughout the film besides making a living and getting the job done. He is by no means on a quest for power or wealth and has no evil in his heart, his lifestyle never changing despite his rising status in the Bufalino Crime Family.Scorsese has crafted a crime film on an entirely new level. While at times the film is very slow and about 35 minutes of its 3-and-a-half-hour runtime could have been cut, 'The Irishman' is a monumental crime epic and a new American classic. This is a Hollywood epic created by some of the most gifted icons in the entertainment industry and the results solidify this.'Goodfellas' will always be Scorsese's greatest film, and I can think of at least three of his other films that I personally enjoyed more than his latest. Yet the veteran director has crafted his most ambitious project yet and delivers a film close to his roots in crime filmmaking that expresses his filmmaking abilities vividly.Scorsese's wisdom and years of experience as a director are exemplified in every frame and sequence, not one moment uninteresting to look at even when the film lags in its narrative. Every character on screen has a purpose and Scorsese and Academy Award-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian ('Schindler's List') ensures that we are well aware of everyone involved in this story. Additionally, Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker has yet again put together a film that visually depicts this story in stunning fashion, the film flowing beautifully between each frame.On-screen, De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci have some of the best chemistry in film history. Each actor says every bit of dialogue naturally, almost as if they never even read the script and are naturally aware of what to say. De Niro gives one of his best performances in years, his best acting expressed in his varied facial expressions that invite us into the actor's thoughts and feelings. Towards the end, De Niro shows off his vulnerability and heart-wrenching talent like you've never seen before, the iconic 'tough guy' portraying a broken soul with nothing left.Pacino has a ball as Jimmy Hoffa, having the opportunity to give another one of his famous on-screen outbursts and given dialogue that only he was born to say. His character's big mouth and stubborn personality give the 'Godfather' actor a chance to have fun and shine as the actor we all know and love.While De Niro and Pacino are beyond impressive, it's Joe Pesci, coming out of retirement to make the film, who delivers the most memorable performance. Usually the hot-headed, cold-blooded killer, most notably as Tommy DeVito in 'Goodfellas,' Pesci delivers a 180 from his previous work. His portrayal as Russell Buflaino is calmer, his character a wise businessman who shows signs of humanity throughout the film. Pesci's work in this film will catch everyone off guard, for they won't be used to seeing him as a soft-spoken, easy-going mastermind who uses his danger strategically instead of loosely.Much of the talk on the film surrounds its high price tag at $160 million and how Netflix chose to produce the film after no other studio would take it due to the budget, as well as the de-aging CGI used on De Niro while portraying Sheeran in his forties. Admittedly, the CGI is ineffective. We can still tell De Niro's true age and it simply doesn't work well enough. However, that's beside the point. We don't need CGI to get what Scorsese is trying to express. Through his artistic direction and his actors' masterful performances, we're sunken into a story about regret and the decisions we make in the past that impact our lives.As always, Scorsese invokes a constant moral ambiguity that makes us empathize with each character despite their illegal and immoral actions. While not as focused as his past films and not entertaining enough to deserve an extremely long runtime, Scorsese has crafted what very well could be the last great mob movie. This may be a film that is better experienced in increments instead of one theatrical viewing, yet theatrically it excels as well due to its stunning direction and an exuberant chronicle of crime.'The Irishman' is one of the best films of 2019 and a visionary crime epic that will be talked about for years.",Null,5,13,28 November 2019
Billy Elliot," Follow your dreams!
","Every human has goals they hope to achieve in their lifetime and in Stephen Daldry's 'Billy Elliot' we come across a character named Billy Elliot who's goal as an eleven year-old boy is to dance in a ballet class and at a high ranking school. Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) has a difficult life by dealing with his harsh father (Gary Lewis), his mean brother (Jamie Draven) the death of his mother who he was very close to and living in a working class town who is not accepting of Billy's dance. One day at school young Billy encounters a ballet class with all girls and joins the class. His teacher Mrs.Wilkinson (Julie Walters) pushes Billy to be great but also forms a sweet relationship with him and serves as a mother figure. Billy shoots for the stars in trying to get acceptance into a royal dance school but more importantly tries to win the love of his family. This is based on the Broadway play that was a huge hit and as a film it is wonderful. At times I felt certain scenes were unnecessary but in the end I was very satisfied with how Billy's relationships turned out and the choices he made. This film shows a more harsh look at the difficulties in achieving your dreams rather than just everything always working out like in some interpretations of this subject matter. The setting of a blue collar English town is very believable and shows how different people are everywhere and how sometimes accepting change in someone can brighten your life. The relationship between Billy and his family is something I found very moving. The turning points with his father and brother are not just randomly occurring but take time to adjust to. I particularly found Julie Walters' character as Mrs.Wilkinson very helpful to the story. She shows the side of a struggling human just like Billy. That helps them bond. Jamie Bell as a young kid does fine work here and most adults I feel can relate to him even as he is a kid. Stephen Daldry directs this film is a decent fashion, but I feel it could have had better shots and a sadder darker mood more often to really emphasize Billy's struggle. It just seems to happy. The ending he handles beautifully. 'Billy Elliot' is a film in which it wants you to ask yourself what is holding you back in life and what you can do to change it.",Null,0,0,30 August 2014
127 Hours," '127 Hours' is a beautiful and stylish true story that will make you thirsty and uncomfortable by just watching one man's extraordinary experience.
","Being stranded with a boulder on top of your arm in the middle of nowhere in Utah while trapped in a canyon for 127 hours is probably one of the most physically and mentally difficult experiences mankind has ever experienced. Believe it or not, this is a true story based on hiker Aaron Ralston's exhausting experience. James Franco plays Aaron, the adventurous nature lover who's life is a little unorganized. When Aaron is hiking in Moab,Utah he meets two girls, enjoys the scenery and then becomes trapped in a canyon with a boulder on top of his arm, not allowing him to escape. Aaron films himself on his camera and uses his food and water supply conservatively. As Aaron reflects on his past life, we see how much he misses his freedom and the measures he's willing to take in order to escape. Danny Boyle films this genius true story with so much beauty that it feels like something out of discovery channel. We see flashbacks of Aaron's life with his childhood, relationships and family that are done very stylishly and are not just simple scenes with traditional dialogue. Boyle uses real-life looking shots of James Franco trapped to make it feel real and transports us to feeling as if we were trapped with him both physically and emotionally. The cinematography of the national park in Utah and beautiful scenes in which we get to feel Aaron's thoughts are the work of genius visual storytellers and put us first hand into the setting of the film. The whole message of this film is to take advantage of life while your able to, or else you'll spend the rest of your time regretting it. While Aaron is trapped, he reflects on how he hasn't worked hard enough on his relationships and how he really hasn't enjoyed life as much as he could have. The respectful tribute at the end to the real-life Aaron Rolston is well done and the ending is a very feel-good crowd pleaser. The main component that helps you feel the experience only the brave Aaron Rolston experienced is James Franco's realistic and beautiful performance. At first we see Aaron as a lazy, chill guy who enjoys clowning around. We get are fun James Franco there until he is trapped and expresses extreme forms of grief and stress as well as sorrow and regret. Franco gives an extremely realistic performance that is one of the best reenactment performances of all time. '127 Hours' is a film that makes us appreciate cinema and life more and hopefully be a warning to stay safe in Utah!",Null,0,0,4 August 2014
Finding Nemo," Underwater has never been so fun!
","Marine life in cinema is very hard to capture in order to make a beautiful film with gorgeous beauty. Animation is the perfect way to show a delightful story and capture the beauty of the Pacific Ocean and the great barrier reef. 'Finding Nemo' is a wonderful story about a clown fish named Nemo who on his first day of school disobeys his father Marlin and is captured by scuba divers to be put in a fish tank. Marlin now goes on a morally obligated quest to find his son with the help of an odd Blue Tang named Dori. The two go through some difficult adventures including escaping from huge sharks, poisonous jellyfish, a whale, sea gulls, rude fish and an angler fish. The two also enjoy themselves between their near death experiences by hanging with some chill sea turtles. As Nemo is separated from his father, he realizes how much he is saddened by being separated by his dad physically and emotionally. Marlin and Dori also use teamwork in many situations which can be used as a teaching skill to children. Teamwork is shown by the fish Nemo encounters when he is placed in a fish tank in a dental office in Australia and how they all work together to escape. Marlin and Dori of course work together to survive the dangers of the ocean and finding Nemo. Children should also pay attention to what disobeying your parents can result in. You should also respect your parents is what Pixar is trying to teach kids and by using a terrifying capture sequence by a menacing diver, kids will definitely get it. Adults can relate to how much our kids mean to us and the measurements and lengths we go at to protect our kids. 'Finding Nemo' is an inspiring animation film, but it is still extremely fun. Mild rude humor by all the creative sea creatures we see hear played by voices of actors such as Albert Brooks (Marlin) and Ellen DeGeneres (Dori) allow laughter to be present as well as some edge of your seat type scenes when danger strikes. The visual beauty of this masterful animation is glorious. The opening shot of Nemo of the vast open water is what made me love film for the first time as a child and will inspire other kids as well. The animation allows you to be put in the position of the natural world in Australia and should provide a perfect appeal of a wonderful film.",Null,1,2,3 August 2014
Superbad," Jonah Hill steals the show in this awesomely comedic buddy flick.
","There are times in 'Superbad' where Jonah Hill delivers a line so perfectly, so brilliantly, and so hilariously that is hurts. He's a comedic force of nature and is the reason why 'Superbad' is one of the funniest and most re-watchable films of all time. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's script (loosely based off of their real-life experiences) is a perfect blend of jokes and heart that follows a reality high school friendship between two nerds who end up trying to prove themselves as big shots. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have brilliant comedic chemistry and are a dynamic duo who I wish would collocate again in future comedies. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the cops who spend the night with the infamous 'McGlovin' are funner than fun and add to the brilliance of this too-much-fun buddy movie that few comedies can dream rivaling.",Null,1,1,16 May 2018
Brokeback Mountain," 'Brokeback Mountain' is the best love story of all time, and shows the difficult homosexual lifestyle powerfully.
","Prejudice towards gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and trans-genders has sadly been part of American society for years. People with different than heterosexual sexual orientations are viewed as sinners and sick due to religion, immature feelings, or tradition. 'Brokeback Mountain' is the story of two men in Wyoming during the 1960's who are assigned a job to heard sheep up near Brokeback Mountain, a tall, magnificent mountain that has wilderness surrounded by it. Ennis Del Mar is a lonely, unsatisfied man who is played brilliantly by Heath Ledger. Ledger gives strong emotions and a terrific western accent to portray a cowboy better than John Wayne ever could. Jack Twist is a more outgoing and fun man who always tries to find a way out of things. He uses strong emotions like Heath Ledger and portrays a man struggling from the inside very powerfully. Ennis and Jack soon fall in love with each other, but have to keep their love a secret from their town in Wyoming or they will face death. Brokeback Mountain represents their love due to its beauty, magnificent scenery and rocky physiology due to Jack and Ennis having relationship struggles. The two men end up marrying women and having families to keep their secret safe. Ennis stays in Wyoming to marry Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack moves to Texas to marry Lureen (Anne Hathaway).' Brokeback Mountain' is a story of secretive love and how no matter the consequences that can be faced, love is the most powerful thing on earth. This film is also an eye-opener to how many homosexuals there really are, no matter if they're married with kids, live in conservative regions, or even act as if they despise homosexuality. The fact that this film is quoted by the immature as 'that stupid gay cowboy movie' is absolutely sickening in the sense that they are missing out on a beautiful story that is extremely important and beautiful, and that they are insensitive to those who are homosexuals. Ang Lee's directing is very magnificent. The shots of the Wyoming scenery near the mountain are beautiful, and the direction of the small, realistic looking towns are very intriguing. He uses great shots and perfect lighting to portray a powerhouse love story. The acting is as powerful as ever that comes from a genius story. Love is a beautiful and hard thing to come by, and is especially hard to enjoy when you have little time to see your partner and have horrendous consequences. This film is a tribute to those in situations that tough, and is owed by the audience to see this masterpiece.",Null,6,6,3 July 2014
Spotlight," 'Spotlight' is the greatest movie about journalism ever made!
","What's unique and extraordinary about 'Spotlight' is that you never feel as if you're viewing a film. You feel you're watching real- life journalists uncover the greatest sex-abuse scandal in American history. Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' is about the journalism heroes at the Boston Globe who told the disturbing true story of how the Catholic Church covered up the wide-scale rape and sexual assault of young kids all over the entire world. The scary thing is that the Boston Globe thought it was just in Boston that this sickening trend was occurring in, but later discovered it was all over the world, being covered up by the Vatican. Tom McCarrthy crafts this win of non-fiction perfectly, giving you the daily lives of the investigative journalists who broke the silence and did the reporting. Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schrieber and Rachel McAdams all give amazing performances that feel so authentic and so real. Each actor studied their real life characters to the most specific detail, and the result is the absence of actors and the bringing to life of real people who did extraordinary things. 'Spotlight' is a disturbing story, but a story that needs to be told, and exposes a horrible story of abuse.",Null,4,8,22 December 2015
500 Days of Summer," '500 Days of Summer' is a great look at relationships and the best romantic comedy of the decade!
","Being in a relationship with someone you love can be one of the most exhilarating and stressful parts of life. The bond between two people is a relationship so unique and intriguing that cinema has been putting it out to us for years. In Marc Webb's delightful and truthful '500 Days of Summer' we see an almost unique but yet typical relationship between two ordinary people. Joseph-Gordon Levitt plays Tom, an average card-company employee who one day sees the girl of his dreams, Summer (Zoey Deschannel)and immediately falls in love and forms a relationship with her. The two experience times of joy and stress as they spend a time experiencing and sharing the world together. The writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H.Weber due a perfect job portraying what being in a committed relationship in your early years is like by showing all dynamics that are faced when being with someone. They use enough humor and drama for balancing the story and show different aspects of Tom and Summer's relationship to not make us completely irritated by hearing Tom and Summer repeat the same parts of a relationship, but rather have a diverse story that allows both characters to be put into different situations and show different sides of each other. '500 Days of Summer' is a film that can help anyone in a struggling relationship, because there is something everyone who has ever dated anybody can relate to from first meeting someone, to breaking up and to having the time of your life in the company of someone beautiful. Joseph-Gordon Levitt's character of Tom is one of the most relatable and likable characters you'll ever experience and Levitt nails every characteristic of playing such a sweet role. Tom will make you feel for him in every heartfelt moment. However, the question that can be raised is whether you'll like Summer. Tom being the lead shows what it's like being in a relationship with someone, but we never really see what Summer's perspective is, which is great because she isn't a likable character and isn't supposed to be focused on. With her tough personality, we get to see Tom flow through a relationship and get his perspective of his situation, allowing us to appreciate his wonderful character. '500 Days of Summer' is a rom-com that doesn't try to hard or do anything typical when it comes to this genre. Instead, it is a well-made and moving masterpiece that is a reflection of what being in a relationship is like and is a cinematic poem.",Null,1,2,12 August 2014

Despite this, it's a funny sequel that fans of the first film with enjoy. In the age of 'Black Panther,' 'Avengers' and a thousand different Spiderman movies, it's nice to have a raunchy, bloody comedic anti-hero put the other boring, stagnant superheroes in their place. I was hoping for a less obnoxious plot and maybe some more time from just Deadpool and not the overreacted supporting charters, but this is an enjoyable sequel that should hopefully end this franchise for good.",Null,2,5,29 May 2018
Milk," Talented people bringing history and human rights to life in an original form of cinematic art.
","Homosexuality has been condemned by the foolish for centuries due to religion and immaturity. One conscience and brave man named Harvey Milk fought for the rights of gay people during his time of being a politician in San Francisco who was elected to the board of supervisors and became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office. Milk was rewarded and eventually assassinated for his work, but his legacy continues to this day to the point where an amazing motion picture files his life. Gus Van Sant directs this blazing film about Harvey Milk. 'Milk' centers around his time fighting for gay rights and the challenges he faced while doing so. Milk gave many powerful speeches, met many other homosexual and heterosexual beings to help his campaign, and shows strength and persistence throughout his battle. What's so original about 'Milk' is its creative screenplay by Dustin Lance Black (a homosexual who idolizes Milk) because he doesn't make your typical biography film that goes in chronological order by showing 'first he did this, then this, then that, and then died.' Instead, 'Milk' shines and is an absolute inspirational triumph about human rights and hope. We see the life of Harvey Milk in a very vivid way that doesn't drag at all. It shoots right into his mission from the second it starts! Sean Penn playing Harvey Milk is a brilliant choice by the casting crew. Penn not only looks almost oddly similar to Harvey Milk, but sounds and acts just like him and gives a tremendous performance. Gus Van Sant also takes you into the prejudice San Francisco 1970's setting excellently. Van Sant allows you to see the consequences homosexuals' faced without being overdone or to political. Excellent visual shots to portray this biography in a moving way, and timeless production and costume design give 'Milk' the final touch in making this a rights film about heroism and freedom that should inspire the public about treating everyone, not just homosexuals with the respect and kindness they deserve.",Null,0,2,14 July 2014

","The cinematic legend Quentin Tarantino excites his fans in a film that blends all of his greatest talents and characteristics. 'The Hateful Eight' follows a group of ruthless, ridiculous, and dangerous people who end up stranded in a cabin called Minnie's Haberdashery during a brutal Wyoming blizzard. With returning favorites of Mr.Tarantino such as Samuel L.Jackson and Kurt Russell, to newcomer to the Tarantino universe Jennifer Jason Leigh, to even more Tarantino favorites including Michael Madsen, Walton Coggins, Bruce Dern, and Tim Roth, we get great actors playing out a brilliant and entertaining script that can only erupt from the brilliant mind of Tarantino himself. We get lots of fun bloody and quirky violence that's either comical, awesome, or darn right cringe-worthy, reminding viewers who's film were watching. The action and violence is straight out of a Tarantino film, being both fun and shocking when it occurs. The original score and cinematography date pay tribute to classic spaghetti westerns, and the film overall is played out like a classic film, showing Tarantino's admiration for cinema as a whole. 'The Hateful Eight' is made to honor the films that impacted Quentin Tarantino deeply, and boy can you tell those films helped him.

"I, Tonya"," Margot Robbie gives a ferocious performance that leads this stylish true story to greatness.
","After about two minutes into 'I, Tonya' I knew it was a new kind of epic work of nonfiction. Director Craig Gillespie knows how to tell a true story. Instead of the 'first I did this, then I did that' style of most biopics, Gillespie and writer Steven Rogers give this film a ferocious energy that hits hard. Margot Robbie's performance as former Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding is legendary, one of the single greatest performances I've ever seen. She portrays Tonya perfectly down to the last detail, while also portraying a broken soul that allows us to sympathize with this historic figure. Allison Janney steals the show as her abusive, foul-mouthed mother who is wickedly funny and hateful. Tonya'a abusive husband, Jeff Gilooly, who was behind the attack on Nancy Kerrigen that put Tonya Harding under suspicion, is magnificent. 'I, Tonya's' rich cinematic style and unique form of storytelling through mocumentary interviews is put together and edited beautifully. The ice skating scenes in particular are done impeccably. This knockout full-throttle true story hits harder than almost any film imaginable. The humanist performances full of rage and sorrow hidden behind a dark comedic undertone bring out a staggering amount of different emotions throughout the film, making 'I, Tonya' a truly special achievement.",Null,1,2,3 February 2018

This is the kind of movie you feel both good and bad after viewing due to the harsh experiences each character endures, but also due to a hopeful message that Haggis leaves you with. 'Crash' won't be on your all-time favorites list, but it'll give you a lot to think about and feel. Each performance is filled with power and dedication, leaving you filled with opinion towards each man and woman who you get to know for a brief amount of time.

This layered film has a wide range of storytelling techniques that generate a fresh and gripping true story and refuses to let go. John David Washington gives a breakthrough performance as the first black police officer in Colorado Springs who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan as an undercover detective yet it's Adam Driver who steals the show as the Jewish detective who comes face-to-face with these truly frightening individuals. Topher Grace does his best work yet as David Duke, being surprisingly funny yet still horribly racist.

Horrible Bosses," Clever premise lost in translation.
","The premise of having three employees fed up wit their horrible bosses (hence the title) to the point where they plan on killing them sounds like comedic gold. But when you have a very large amount of unnecessary dialogue, hit or miss jokes that fail, and an absolute horrendous cast with not one person remaining funny throughout the story to carry it on, then my friend you have a wasted opportunity. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis are the three men trying to kill their bosses. Bateman has Kevin Spacey being a total jerk to him, Day is sexually assaulted by Jennifer Aniston who goes out of her comfort zone as an actress and is the only truly funny actor in the film, and Sudeikis has Colin Farrell be a jerk as well. All three bosses could have been funnier and crueler, but the casting choices here are strong. The three miserable men, however, couldn't have been picked worse. Jason Bateman is so overrated in everything he does. Not once does he embrace the fact that this is a comedy. He just sits still and waits for his paycheck. Charlie Day's disgusting voice and fast talking energy make him one of the most annoying actors out there. Here he goes full-on annoying. Jason Sudeikis tries too hard and acts cocky just because he was on SNL. He isn't funny for a second and is a real lame comedian. The guys have no chemistry together. The script written by four people is very weak. There are too many hit or miss jokes and not many laugh out-loud moments. I will admit 'Horrible Bosses' has its moments. There are scenes in which the ridiculously failed situations by the guys trying to kill their bosses calls for a little chuckle. Other than that, there's nothing. This isn't a stupid comedy with no plot other than pathetic dialogue. It is a very clever idea that needs stronger casting, more original dialogue, and more fun.",Null,1,1,23 November 2014

","Whitey Bulger is one of the most notorious American criminals in history. His story is meant to be recorded on the big screen in order to document the overwhelming power and influence he had on the Boston mafia and on America. Sadly, 'Black Mass' fails to do so. Even though Johnny Depp gives a cool and menacing portrayal of Bulger, the writing and directing is misplaced, focusing more on the cops than the criminals. If more focus was taken away from the FBi who negotiated and bribed the Boston gangster and was directed towards the man himself, then you'd have a story. Instead you get cop cliché's and the same broken record of a story played out that leads just as expected. Bulger's story is unique and dark, great material for a film.

The Town," 'The Town' is a remarkable thriller.
","Boston. The bank robbery capital of the world. 'The Town' isn't your typical cops and robbers good guy bad guy kind of thriller, but rather a rare piece of crime cinema that raises moral questions and still delivers exhilarating action. Ben Affleck (who usually is a let down) directs and stars as Doug Macray, a life-long bank robber who after a heist reconnects by chance with Claire, a woman taken hostage by Doug and his gang who's played by Rebecca Hall. I know what you're thinking. Don't worry. This Hollywood-like plot doesn't fall into a traditional love story at all. Doug's feelings and motives for robbing banks change drastically after he forms a relationship with Claire, while also battling a ruthless FBI agent played blandly by Jon Hamm. The real superstar of the film is played by Jeremy Renner. Renner is Affleck's best friend who still has a bad side revealed constantly throughout the film. 'The Town' excels at balancing action with emotions. Affleck raises multiple moral ideas about changing your life around and fighting for those you love. We do get trapped in a little bit of over the top nonsense regarding love and forgiveness. That's the only big issue. Blake Lively also plays Affleck's old girlfriend. Blake Lively, sorry honey, you can't act. Even though there are some flaws, 'The Town' remains consistent in being both entertaining and thoughtful. The final thirty minutes of the film are pitch perfect, resolving all the major conflicts and delivering heart-pounding action resulting with machine gun fire and car chases flying all over the screen. Even though the action is far-fetched, Affleck keeps 'The Town' grounded in remaining a human drama that reflects the hard life criminals face day to day, and why criminals act the way they do. Affelck's goal isn't to just entertain you. He makes you question and look at crime differently. Boy did he nail it.",Null,0,1,19 June 2015
Taxi Driver," Martin Scorsese achieves cinematic greatness by giving us the classic 'Taxi Driver' with a chilling performance by Robert De Niro.
","People living in a low-social class with constant disrespect being enforced on them tend to want to branch out and finally achieve greatness. In order to do so, what does oneself do? Martin Scorsese directs an unsettling lifestyle in a dark and mysterious way artistically. . Robert De Niro gives one of his most cutting edge performances as Travis, a mentally disturbed Taxi Driver in New York who after serving his time in Vietnam is unhappy with his lonely and worthless life. Travis is treated poorly by the people he drives around, makes no money, lives alone, watches pornographic films and is going nowhere. One day he meets a beautiful volunteer for a senator of New York running for President. As Travis fails at their relationship, he becomes sick by the crime and prostitution occurring on the streets, so begins physical training and arms himself from the dangers. Travis eventually meets a young prostitute named iris (Jodie Foster) and tries to take out an evil pimp played by Harvey Keitel who treats Iris poorly. Travis is such an interesting character who shows the life of misery perfectly. Travis' transformation from a low-life to a man on a mission constantly always on guard is chilling and gut-wrenching. Scorsese shows the treatment of post Vietnam marines and awakens the world as to how hard it was to cope with ordinary society and the lifestyle of being a nobody like no one you have ever seen. Writer Peter Schrader gives a blistering story that starts off slow and makes us want to feel sad for Travis, but then leads us into a degrading world filled with crime and gets under your skin like a razor blade. Robert De Niro transforms his character beautifully, giving chilling sequences when he's the only character on screen, or when he's dealing with some of the sickest criminals imaginable. Perfect acting by De Niro portraying a soulless man with a troubled past and a determined psycho with a heart. He's a diverse actor playing a diverse character. Scorsese portrays the streets of New York in a tale of politics, crime and mental health disorders and works with everyone greatly to make a creative film. 'Taxi Driver' has a very complex ending that allows you to decide what it meant. That fits in with the mysterious feel and style of the film. We get to see a corrupt society through one man and it is absolutely fascinating to see it through a disturbed and mentally ill person. 'Taxi Driver' is a film that filmmakers look at for inspiration and should be regarded as one of the most unique and gripping works of art you'll ever encounter.",Null,0,1,3 August 2014
Shutter Island," Martin Scorsese directs his most unique and suspenseful film in 'Shutter Island.'
","Martin Scorsese has been one of cinema's most iconic figures, delivering classic films that have his name written all over them. he has bis own style. In his film 'Shutter Island' based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, we see Scorsese direct a very bizarre and suspenseful film for his type of film making. Leonardo Dicaprio gives one of his best performances as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels. Teddy is a WW II veteran who is haunted from his past, and has a deceased family that still stick with him in his blackened soul. He and his partner come to an island off the cost of Boston that is reserved primarily for an insane asylum for the criminally ill. The patients are mostly violent murderers. Teddy and his partner are tracking down a missing patient who mysteriously escaped and could be anywhere. The film gives shocking results and suspenseful situations in the dark insane asylum with many wacky people. Scorsese does an amazing job adding terror and fear to the audience by creating intense scenes that make the dark and dirty island realistic. Scorsese hasn't done a film this unique and dark in his career, and still sticks with his love of crime dramas but adds darkness and mystery to this intense masterpiece. The adapted screenplay is written perfectly by Laeta Kalogridis who puts the true mystery behind this complex story and leaves enough work for Scorsese to turn the films suspense into a visual masterpiece. The character development and rich language are compiled beautifully as well. 'Shutter island' has perfect cinematic texture that will leave you hungry for more, and doesn't leave any unanswered questions which I was deeply worried about. The acting performance by Leonardo Dicaprio is so intense and powerful. Leo does great facial expressions and screams and cries his head off in scenes that will leave you speechless. Martin Scorsese has always been one of the most influential filmmakers cinema has ever scene, but now he's proving he can do suspense better than Hitchcock, and create cinematic gems that will trick you and will hit you like a hurricane off the coast of an island for the criminally insane.",Null,0,4,24 June 2014
Life of Pi," Ang Lee captures the beauty of life in a gorgeous masterpiece!
","'Life of Pi' is a critically acclaimed novel that sparked the interest of readers nationwide. Now you get to see the film version! Film is the greatest artwork in the history of mankind. It captures the way we see the world and incorporates an infinite amount of art forms that no other art can. 'Life of Pi' is the story of a young Indian boy named Pi. Pi lives with his family in the most beautiful part of India and has a perfect life until his father makes him and his family move to Canada. In India the family owned a zoo. This caused over 100 animals to be brought aboard the ship to Canada. When a viscous storm kills everyone on board the ship except Pi and a few animals including a Bengal Tiger, Pi embarks on the most difficult and amazing adventure of his life; survival. Pi experiences wildlife at sea like no one can imagine. He forms a bond between the tiger which he named Richard Parker that is more moving than any Disney motion picture. The spectacular beauty the visual effects team created are remarkable. Almost entirely are all the animals digitally mastered throughout the film! They look so real! Ang lee directs this film superbly by making every film aspect over viewed and guided perfectly. The cinematography, film editing, and music are absolutely gorgeous and provide visual art that cannot be matched. The screenplay by David Magee is true to the book very well. The key factor that makes 'Life of Pi' so special is that it can relate to every audience. Children can enjoy seeing beautiful animals and exciting storm scenes while adults can be entertained with them. The deep metaphors in the story are easily explained making it impossible to miss them. I love how this film was PG so that parents can explain the rich depth this film captures making it explainable to youngsters. Life of Pi has rich cinematic structure with beauty and grace to portray one of the greatest stories ever told in the greatest art form ever invented.",Null,1,3,15 June 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Poorly executed war drama that try's to be too many things at once.
","The soldiers who served in the Vietnam war first had two traumatic experiences to face: Getting past the excruciating boot camps and not dying in battlefield. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick makes a poorly organized film that is more of an ill-matched compilation of two situations revolving around these two difficult paths in the Vietnam War. Hiring a real-life Drill Sgrt, Kubrick seeked R.Lee Ermey to scare the heck out of numerous amounts of soldiers in a boot camp. We spend way too much time here. None of the soldiers are three-dimensional, Vincent D'Onofrio keeps being traumatized by everyone, and this aspect of 'Full Metal Jacket' should have been played as just an exposition rather than an entire half of the film. None of the characters change in a moving way. The performances get tired fast. The second half is about the soldiers from this platoon shooting their way out in Vietnam. While Kubrick does do a decent job portraying the hardship soldiers have to go through like almost every other war filmmaker has, Kubrick doesn't make this a compelling story. We get to see some undeveloped soldiers shoot around and go through a couple situations before the story cuts. This isn't a story. It is an examination of two aspects of Vietnam. Having both of them in the same film is ambitious, but both scenarios don't parallel or correspond with each other. It feels like two films put together, making Kubrick fail in his ambition. This film tries to blend forced black-comedy with choppy war scenes that have horrible editing and sound. The war scenes are not compelling at all do to no suspense what so ever and blandly executed energy from Kubrick. The slow-motion aspect doesn't work in this film either. It kind of makes it strange. 'Full Metal Jacket' is an all over the place war film that plays more like a one-layered tough situation for characters we barely know.",Null,0,1,22 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Sensational. Accomplishes what few films can only dream of.
","Martin McDonagh's 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is one of the most unique, captivating stories you'll ever experience. Set in the small Midwest town from the title, Frances McDormand delivers a magnificent performance as Mildred Hayes, a tortured soul who places three billboards with attacks against the local police force for failing to heavily investigate the rape and murder of her teenage daughter. Woody Harrelson gives a surprisingly gleeful perforce as the police commissioner battling cancer, but Sam Rockwell steals the show as Jason Dixon, a short- tempered drunken fool with signs of a heart tucked in beneath him. Martin McDonagh captures the rural Midwest in exuberant detail, portraying a realistic town of people with both depressing and outrageous content. McDonagh's script is perfect. He not only has rich and interesting characters, but explores a depressed town with struggling individuals and emphasizes their natures brilliantly. Through grief and loss, McDonagh's characters shine in spectacular fashion, depicting angered souls who all are trying to do what they feel is right, while also learning the importance of forgiveness and empathy. Few films capture human nature so poetically. 'Billboards' reminds us the value of human beings and dances around the barriers of society. Brilliantly, we get an unusual turn of events that reflect deeper depths of life, all while being transported by unmatched acting and truly special filmmaking.",Null,2,8,22 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Despite the negative backlash, the latest and final installment in the Skywalker story ends 'Star Wars' on the right note.
","The story that has spanned over 40 years has finally come to an end. The ninth and final installment in the franchise that forever changed the way movies were made and generated one of the most widespread, hardcore fandoms in entertainment history concludes the main 'Star Wars' saga in an epic adventure that concludes the 9-film series on an uplifting and exciting note.After 2017's disastrous 'The Last Jedi' that outraged millions of loyal 'Star Wars' fans, director J.J. Abrams fixed Rian Johnson's horribly misguided and downright weird direction and grounds the film true to the nature of 'Star Wars.' While the 'Last Jedi' felt like an awkward soap opera that lacked any style and was weighed down with cringe-worthy humor and a dull storyline, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is centered in the feeling of a 'Star Wars' movie, containing a style that reflects earlier works in the franchise (mostly 'Return of the Jedi'), yet is still able to stand out on its own.Abrams had the highly difficult challenge as a director and co-writer of cleaning up after Johnson's previous mess to conclude the story in a neat and well-paces fashion, wrap up a series of 9 films, and please one of the biggest fan bases in the world. While 'Star Wars' fans are without question the pickiest, obnoxious entertainment fans on the planet who not only never seemed to be pleased but have no actual idea of what they want to see, Abrams crafts a picture that wildly succeeds in concluding an epic series of films and keeping us engaged from start to finish.'The Rise of Skywalker' never has a dull moment, the kinetic pace of the conflict encompassing several heartwarming moments meant to pay tribute to the characters explored, some of which we've known since 'A New Hope' all the way back in 1977. As one could expect, Abrams incorporates stunning visual elements in every scene, the production design and visual effects glowing off the screen and making this a spectacular film to view.Since the trailers and posters have already confirmed this, the return of Emperor Palpatine is an odd decision. Considering Abrams didn't have much room to play with in terms of storyline after the decisions Rian Johnson made in 'The Last Jedi,' we can certainly at times feel Abrams trying to piece everything together and making it try and seem like he and Disney had a clear vision of the trilogy as opposed to coming up with everything on the spot.While the return of Palpatine may feel like a last resort, Abrams does a great job of organizing the plot for this film and not cramming in a bunch of content to end the saga. The entire film is brilliantly paced, the story overall organized and shining with exciting action. It goes without saying that this trilogy took a turn for the worse after the last installment, but Abrams somehow manages to rescue it and turn it back into the promising, magical adventure that the 'Force Awakens' teased in 2015.Many (especially die-hard fans) are displeased with this film and criticize it for having a messy plot that fails to generate any sympathy or positivity. I am personally shocked by how anyone who claims to like 'Star Wars' overall can't help but fall in love with this movie. It may be highly predictable and the relationship between Rey and Finn that was explored in 'The Force Awakens' is barely touched upon, yet every character has a chance to shine, including the late Carrie Fisher, whose previously unused scenes were added back in to pay tribute and finish her storyline. Daisy Ridley additionally delivers her best performance as Rey yet, making her stand out as one of the best characters in the franchise along with the stellar Adam Driver as the complex Kylo Ren.As someone who enjoys 'Star Wars' for the fun blockbuster action and sentimental storylines that relate to the original trilogy, 'The Rise of Skywalker' delivered nearly everything I wanted to see. The film concludes the Skywalker story and the main story in the 'Star Wars' phenomenon beautifully and Abrams draws us into the cinematic universe that blew everyone's minds years ago with tremendous excitement, fun, and heart.",Null,2,5,22 December 2019
American Sniper," Bradley Cooper shoots it up in this missed opportunity that is completely underwhelming
","Chris Kyle is the most famed sniper in U.S. military history. He killed nearly 160 enemy soldiers during the war in Iraq, documenting himself in his book 'American Sniper.' Now Clint Eastwood directs Bradley Cooper to portray Chris Kyle as the diligent soldier who slayed those who tried to harm him. Demonstrating the effects the war had on Kyle, Bradley Cooper gives a solid performance in this underwhelming war film that fails to be thoughtful or interesting for one second. Sure, Eastwood films a couple of intense war scenes, but he does a terrible job of showing what the war was really like. Eastwood uses the PSTD cliché like almost every other war film, which shows the lack of originality this film, has. Perhaps why it is so bad is because Chris Kyle just wasn't a good writer. After all, the film was adapted by Jason Hall. The script is yet another cliché, giving regurgitated dialogue to undeveloped characters. Bradley Cooper seems irritated throughout the whole film, tired of being in the same type of scene for two hours without anything interesting or profound to say or do. The biggest head-scratcher is that Chris Kyle is only seen using a sniper a couple of times throughout the film, but uses a semi-automatic assault rifle constantly. Not really a sniper after all. The ridiculous controversy surrounding this film is pathetic as well, but the real issue is that 'American Sniper' fails to do anything unique or astounding given the strong source available to create a good story.",Null,0,10,22 March 2016
Forrest Gump," Everyone has got to see it at least once!
","There are certain films that literally anyone who participates in viewing films has seen and should see and 'Forrest Gump' is a prime example. 'Forrest Gump' is a unique type of film that is a narrative/flashback/current time style film about one man named Forrest Gump, one of the biggest cinematic character icons of all time from legendary actor Tom Hanks. Forrest is mentally challenged. He doesn't suffer from mental retardation, but it can be implied he is slightly autistic. Forrest Gump has had an incredible life. After being bullied as a child for having braces on his legs and being autistic in Georgia, he went on to be an all American football player due to his tremendous speed and ended up meeting JFK. He was a war hero in Vietnam where he lost his friend Bubba but later took care of his family financially due to becoming very successful in Bubba's shrimp business. To add on to Forrest's talent, he became an international ping pong player after becoming skilled in the war hospital and makes a national news landmark by leading many others to go for a run around the country. But the events that shape Forrest's life are not by his achievements but from his relationships. His childhood lover Jenny (Robin Wright) has always been Forrest's main motivation. After a fun childhood and having an abusive father, jenny ends up making mistakes. She became a model for an inappropriate magazine, became a singer at a sex club, joined the hippie movement while Forrest was ironically fighting the war where she became a drug addict, and became highly depressed. Forrest also met his friend Lieutenant Dan, his war leader who lost his legs in Vietnam before Forest saved his life. The two have a fascinating relationship. Forrest and his mother are also very close and encourages Forrest commonly. Forrest Gump tells his story to various people on a bench while sitting on the bus station. What writer Eric Roth does to this adapted story is show us how the simplest people can be inspirations and even heroes. I bet 10/10 people 9/10 times would ignore whoever is next to them and find no interest what so ever. Forrest Gump is a man of amazement and can teach us that no matter one's disability mentally or physically, they can be important people. Director Robert Zemmeckis takes us throughout American History and shows how one man's life related to some of the most crucial times our country faced. He uses great time change and uses the shift between flashbacks, narration, and modern time beautifully. We get great film aspects to show this inspiration come to life. The different types of locations are designed beautifully, from Vietnam to the white house, we see amazing settings to portray the life around one simple man. The beautiful character development and classic text allow us to be wrapped around in pure movie magic and experience world class cinema from a talented team. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is genius and fun to watch as we see this man be brought to life by one of the greatest actors we will ever see. The supporting cast is terrific and everyone in this picture gives tremendous effort to give us a classic film. It isn't recognized this widely for no reason. The most famous quote from this film is 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get.' Well, with Forrest Gump you definitely know what your gonna get... an amazing film that is inspiring and reflecting on how each person is beautiful.",Null,1,1,22 July 2014
Gone Baby Gone," Gripping and haunting to strengthen the complexity of American crime.
","Ben Affleck turns the tides and surprisingly delivers a wonderful directorial debut by adapting Dennis Lehane's novel into a new American crime classic. Ben uses his little brother Casey to play Patrick, a detective who with his girlfriend Angie (Michelle Monaghan)investigates the disappearance of a young girl who mysteriously vanished from her lazy, drunken mother played with a pitch-perfect Boston accent by Amy Ryan. This story is familiar turf. What Affleck does with this familiarity is turn it into a mind-bending and heartbreaking thriller with intense information about a compelling crime case, and give an in depth analysis of maternity and doing the right thing. Casey gives a knock-out performance and we get strong supporting work from old timers Ed Harris and Morgan Freedman, and especially from the shockingly talented Amy Ryan. By portraying the hardship of industrial and working-class America in the streets of Boston, we come across terrifying and sometimes just plain old ugly Bostonians who all have something to do with the case. Not only does this film end different than you'll expect, it provokes your senses and leaves you filled with wonder and really takes a big fat piece out of your spirit. It's hauntingly chilling and effective while resolving some conflict but implying a long hardship of absence from perfection. By not trying to hard and not giving bogus dialogue or a lousy climax, Ben Affleck proves he is better suited fro behind the camera than in front of it (no offense Ben). He's not doing anything legendary with his direction, but he's giving a hardcore, f-bomb filled story light. By focusing on the internal and external aspects of Patrick's situation, 'Gone Baby Gone' truly deserves to be recalled years from now as a life-lesson sort of film and a shocking new look at the American crime system.

21 Jump Street," Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are a dynamic duo of comedy in '21 Jump Street.'
","Comedy can be brought into fame due to a couple that interact with each other in a comical way. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are that couple in '21 Jump Street.' The two star as cops who are assigned to go undercover at a high school to get a drug bust. The mission isn't so smooth as they face their hilarious struggles and meet bizarre people like the gym teacher and certain students. The comedy in this film comes from the rambunctious activity these two men pursue. They swear their heads off, party, say hilarious stuff, and do a pretty terrible job at giving justice a name. Jonah Hill is a nerdy, awkward guy who isn't so good at being street smart or physically capable at being a cop, but instead as other strengths such as blending in or managing stress. Channing Tatum is more the street smart kick-ass character. Together they create a dynamic-duo that will crack you up for days. Many lines the two guys have are hilarious, but its more the spoofing of themselves that really stand out. The melodramatic scenes in which their identifications are almost revealed provide mayhem in a comedic way as well. Popcorn comedy films provide the perfect sense of joy, and when their are two genies comedians doing their funniest work yet in an awesome plot, you have comedy gold.",Null,1,3,18 June 2014
American Hustle," 'American Hustle' is a time piece with excellent cinematic elements and gives you something to think about.
","One of 2013's best films comes from modern film legend David O.Russell. Irving Rosenfeld (played versatility by Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (an amazing Amy Adams) are two con artist who get caught by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (a perfect Bradley Cooper). In punishment, Richie forces Sydney and Irving to help him take down corrupt congressmen and mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) in order for him to become respected and famous in the law world. Irving is well-rounded when it comes to the crime world due to his experiences as a con-man, which is why Richie requests he help him. Irving's loose-canyon wife Rosalyn (A hilarious and exhilarating Jennifer Lawrence) is caught between the situation, and struggles at parenting and keeping a strong marriage with Irving. Throughout the film we see interesting systems in taking down the congressmen and how Richie, Irving, and Sydney's relationships evolve. David O. Russells's screenplay is so creative and well- constructed and delivers monumental storytelling from his rich character development, complex plot, and interesting twists and turns. Every actor in this film is spectacular. Christian Bale delivers a very unique performance and proves he can act as any character. Amy Adams is just overall brilliant as a woman faced with difficult situations and adapting to her surroundings. Bradley Cooper is by far the most interesting character, as he evolves into a greedy agent who portrays a hypocritical, self-centered law enforcer. Jennifer Lawrence adds comedy and vital conflict to the story as Irving's wife who is cheated on and raises a son with Irving. The directing by David O.Russell is brilliant as he takes you into the 70's like no other filmmaker. Every shot and element of film was revised and put together masterfully and proves he is one of the best filmmakers of our time. The other elements such as editing, production and costume design, cinematography, and music make the film complete by adding cinematic value in a classic way. 'American Hustle' provides a complex plot with great cinematic elements that should provide intelligent viewers with a sense of artistic joy.",Null,1,4,2 June 2014

Nightcrawler," 'Nightcrawler' is creepy and intelligent.
","Few films can give such a bold message so subtly. 'Nightcrawler,' a new noir classic, does it perfectly. This is the kind of film you walk in not knowing what to really expect and come out leaving thrilled and still shocked. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a chilling and furious performance as Louis Bloom, one of many poor people desperate for work who ends up finding a creepy and pretty messed up job: violent crime journalism. That means that he waits and stalks down crime scenes or crashes that result in blood so he can document, film, and send the footage for profit to news cooperations. What Louis engages in ends up controlling his life. Writer and director Dan Gilroy as a debut film knocks it out of the park. This film, almost completely at night, speaks the truth about a lot of media and engages us to contemplate our interest in violence and terror. Gyllenhaal, who lost tons of weight, enthralls himself deeply into his character, leaving us shocked and amazed. Everything about 'Nightcrawler' seems to fit, from its exciting action and heart-pounding climax, to its sleek shots of L.A., and its beautifully paced writing and directing.

DiCaprio, as always, is terrific in his portrayal of Howard Hughes. He doesn't just read his lines and try to mimic the real-life figure, but he engrosses himself in his performance. Scorsese does a good job direction g the film, but this one isn't one of his best in the long run. Goodfellas will always be number one, and compared to other hits, The Aviator isn't much to remember. it's a well-made, one-time see kind of film that drags out for an astonishingly long time and doesn't leave you wowed or engrossed for for.

The Bourne Identity," Thriller? More like a snoozer shown on airplanes to put people to sleep.
","Who doesn't like a good thriller once in a while? We're sadly bound to Hollywood providing cheap films in our local multiplex when the word, 'thriller' comes to mind. It's the independent hits with an appreciation for reality that make you grasp at the edge of our seats. The birth of a soon to be five-film franchise is so far the most lame and lifeless. All the necessities for a successful film both in qualitative and financial terms are at the edge of the producers of, 'The Bourne Identity' noses. Based loosely on Robert Ludlum's novel, the Bourne Identity is the story of a man whose wounded body is discovered by fishermen who nurse him back to wellness. He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as the Swiss bank account, the number of which, is implanted in his hip. Familiar territory, anyone? He soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with a girl on a search to find out who he is and why he is being hunted. The whole identity crisis element gets tangled into so many films that don't even require the film to be good. We spend money on films to excite us, and since producers, writers, and directors know how to make easy films that can please audiences based on financial data, they throw the same baloney at us. 'The Bourne Identity' relies on an identity crisis. Nothing is thrilling, exciting, or even the slight most interesting. Every second feels like a bedtime story kids beg to end to fall asleep. Director Doug Liman can do pretty fun things in wildly entertaining blockbusters, but he kind of just tells his crew to make sure the sound is loud and the camera is still. The whole films plays like the sound on a medical machine that stimulates the knowledge that a guy died. You follow?

That said, 'Baby Driver's' strongest aspect is the love story between Ansel Egort as the getaway driver and Lily James as the adorable waitress.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Magic and fantasy brought to life in a groundbreaking form!
","Books that contain battles, unique creatures, battle sequences, and fantastic adventures just have to be made into a film. 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy is perhaps the most famous set of stories in the history of art. Author J.R.R Tolkien uses creativity and adventure to explore the joy of imagination that other artists can use to better represent it. If you don't know the story of 'The Lord of the Rings' you need to listen more. Basically, there are little people called hobbits and one of them named Bilbo found an important ring that is coveted by many. The ring causes extreme chaos around middle earth due to the evil lord Sauron, the magical kingdom where dragons, elves, dwarfs, evil creature called orcs, and kingdoms of men exist and fight to keep safety. When the wizard Gandalf goes with Bilbo to discuss with others how to get the ring to Mordor, the evil kingdom filled with terror which is the only place it can be destroyed, Bilbo's nephew Frodo volunteers, but many come with to join him on the adventure and to protect him. Frodo has Aragorn, the brave man, his fellow hobbit friends, an elf, a dwarf, Gandalf and more to bring peace to middle earth. Filmed in the beautiful country of New Zealand, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' starts of this trilogy in a visual way with pure beauty and imagination. The creatures, costumes, sets, visual effects, you name it it's amazing. Magic has never been brought to art so wonderfully and intensely than in this trilogy and the first film definitely sets the mood for the rest of the trilogy. Unique characters, being true to the story, and honoring the creative writer J.R.R. Tolken is what you'll get.

Amazing visual works of art with cinematography and editing and genies work and cooperation by director Peter Jackson allow a complete masterpiece. This visual icon is pure imaginative magic and is a prime example of creativity.

Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu strikes again with amazing directing that organizes the look and feeling of the film perfectly. Innaritu doesn't tell you a story, he puts you into it and makes you connect with a film instead of view one. Cinematogrpaher Emmauel Lubuzki (who deserves his third straight Oscar) crafts beautiful shots of both his subjects and the natural setting the film revolves in. It's an amazing work of art that Lubuzki makes, giving 'The Revenant' a beautiful visual appeal. 'The Revenant' is all about nature, more specifically man vs nature, man vs man and man vs self. Hugh Glass encounters all three challenges and experiences nature in many forms, nut just from nature in the wild, but human nature of all types. We understand Glass's feelings through his eyes and through his encounters with various native Americans (who are also enemies of the fur trappers).

","When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? Michael Arndt, the writer of 'Little Miss Sunshine' would say a winner. The whole theme of 'Little Miss Sunshine' is how every person is full of strength and is truly a person of triumphant talent. This original masterpiece is about a lower middle-class family in New Mexico, who's youngest daughter Olive ( Abigail Breslin) competes in little girl modeling pageants and has a dream of becoming a supermodel. She is a very quirky child who has a very odd family. Her uptight dad with a failing business (Greg Kinear), her boring mom (Toni Collete), her suicidal homosexual uncle (Steve Carrell), her miserable brother who doesn't speak (Paul Dano), and her raw, cynical, loud Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who trains her to model. When Olive gets a call stating she can compete in a Little Miss Sunshine model competition, her family takes an old vehicle and takes a road trip out to California! Much conflict erupts due to the trip, but more victory is achieved as each character finds out who they really are and how to become happy. Each character has goals they are fighting for that give them something to strive for. Each actor is delightful and portrays each character to the point where it's almost impossible to picture anybody else playing these characters. The humor that this unique family brings to the screen in more humorous than you'll find in any Ben Stiller movie. To top of the natural humor, you'll get sometimes sad, powerful scenes as well as deep messages that can indeed be life- changing. Everyone is triumphant, everyone matters. If you struggle with those topics in yourself, see this film. This delightful masterpiece is a gem that reminds us the true power of independent cinema.",Null,0,0,5 July 2014

What works about 'Knowing' is that it leaves you thrilled and delivers shocks and twists at every turn. Cage actual delivers a decent performance, but his acting isn't why we seek out films such as this.

I had a very hard time being engaged and caring about any of the characters but wasn't really surprised. Nothing about this film stood out to me, not even the extensive visual elements. While the costume design is nice, the production design is above average, and the sound is clear, I wasn't arrested visually and found the cinematography and filming style to be very bothersome and distracting. Nothing about this film stood out to me and it is best to be forgotten.",Null,1,1,21 December 2018
American Beauty," 'American Beauty' finds the beauty of every story no matter how treacherous and reaches boundaries unlike any other film.
","Spectacle's are clearly vulnerable to being enjoyed by the world and are easy to get access to. Seeing a firework show, looking at a beautiful person, enjoying the scenery of a mountain range, and seeing a world- series baseball game finish in an intense inning are all full of beauty in their own ways. What about the simple lives of people no matter how they live or act? Writer Alan Ball creates a masterpiece of writing about enjoying the simplicity of life and finding the beauty of every moment. Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Lester Burnham, a depressed middle-class American who is unsatisfied with his uneventful and crashing life. His relationships with his wife and daughter are strained and tense, his job causes him extreme stress and he has nothing to escape from it. The only sense of happiness Lester now gets is having interactions with his daughters beautiful friend that causes hope for Lester. Lester's wife Carolyn is played perfectly by Annette Benning. Carolyn is rather harsh and cold to Lester and is having an affair. Their daughter Jayne is constantly observed by their neighbor's son Ricky, who is very artistic and finds the beauty of absolutely everything in any shape, size, fashion or form. He is obsessed with Jayne and his motivations and love for her are interesting because deep down we all know how we have that urge to strive for our unrequited lovers even though most of us are too shy and fragile to face criticism. Ricky lives with his deeply anti-gay father who is cast perfectly as Chris Cooper. The more and more this story goes on, the less beauty we see. Then why is this film called 'American Beauty'? Because writer Alan Ball and director Same Mendes show how diverse and special each character is and show how dynamic and deep we all are on the inside. Sam Mendes portrays the middle-class American lifestyle brilliantly by not overdoing or forcing the look of the setting and coaching of the actors in the slightest. Instead we see the harsh reality of struggling lifestyles and how with love and inspiration our emotions can be changed in a snap. Mendes examines simple people and general people with feelings, sexuality, weaknesses, and motifs to show how each ordinary individual is in fact extraordinary and not at all simple or weak. What's really moving about 'American Beauty' isn't just its classic acting and tremendous film-making, but rather the boundaries it takes. A somewhat quirky character ensemble and harshly situated plot end up leaving us to see how there is always a way out of negativity and that in order to achieve happiness we need to see the beauty everyday has no matter what is occurring at our lives. 'American Beauty' is a beautiful and brilliant American film classic!",Null,0,1,26 July 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," 'Silver Linings Playbook' just works in every way! It's one of the most feel-good films of all time!
","Mental illness is an issue all over the world. It ruins lives and causes many problems. Mental illness can also cause goodness. In David O.Russell's terrific film 'Silver Lining's Playbook' we see two unique characters, Pat and Tiffany, who struggle from emotional and mental problems. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, an ex-teacher who is recently released from a mental health institution. Pat tries to make his life better by working things out with his relationships. His wife left him due to his problems and cheated on him before hand. Pat has extreme anger issues that are revealed multiple times, and are especially powerful in an intense fight between him and his tough father played by Robert De Niro. Pat is agitated easily, is pretty lonely, isn't happy with the way things are going, and then meets Tiffany. She has her own issues. Tiffany is played exceptionally by Jennifer Lawrence. Tiffany is unemployed due to sexual matter, has a deceased husband, has anger and emotional issues, and doesn't really have anyone in her life. As the two form a relationship, they enter a dance competition which helps their friendship grow. What's excellent about this film is that it shows what it's like having mental illness and how it can be solved. The themes of friendship, acceptance, and love show how people can fight mental illness. It also shows how people who have struggles are still people and should be treated as so. Every actor was terrific. Bradley Cooper proves he's more than just a comedian by giving the best performance of an actor in 2012. Jennifer Lawrence gives a break-through performance as well. The supporting cast including Jackie Weaver and Robert De Niro are wonderful and realistic as well. David O.Russell's screenplay is so rich and contains excellent characters and themes and is overall a healthy, delightful, feel-good story. He also adds monumental directing to capture the change and glory of the characters to make this one of the most inspiring films you'll ever see!",Null,0,2,15 June 2014
Collateral," Michael Mann's 'Collateral' is one of the greatest crime thrillers in the history of cinema!
","Normal life can change in one incident, which is why it must be enjoyed every day. Michael Mann directs a horrifyingly intense crime thriller that has a deep reflection on enjoying life and the theme of chance. Jamie Foxx stars as a nerdy cab driver named Max who is a simple man with big dreams. He lives a routine life by driving a cab and being a nice guy. However, when the slick and cold-hearted hit-man named Vincent (Tom Cruise)enters a cab and forces Max to make five spots to kill people, the morals and nature of both their lives are drastically changed. The men encounter Vincent's spots that can end well or sometimes lead into close calls. Max gets very frustrated with Vincent's violence, and is tested morally. Michael Mann gives such an energy and kinetic, vibrate feel to this film. Even though the two men drive around for a while, there is still that uncertain intensity that can lead in any direction. With one of the best ending sequences of all time, and rich character development that will toy with your feelings, you won't be bored a second in 'Collateral.' Rich acting by Foxx and Crusie who represent the good and bad and show how extremely similar and different the two sides are, and the important themes of living the best you can are experienced to somewhat reflect how we are important people no matter what paths or choices you take.

Dunkirk," 'Dunkirk' is impeccably made but lacks depth.
","Beloved filmmaker Christopher Nolan explores arguably the most important battle of WW II, following the allied forces in Dunkirk, France trying to survive a powerful Nazi attack. The British, French, Belgians, Polish and Dutch forces aren't trying to be heroes, they're trying to be survivors. Survival is what Nolan wants the audience to understand, and unlike most war films, it lacks a powerful message. This is where 'Dunkirk' fails. Lacking not only character development, it portrays nothing interesting or captivating about this important battle. We get countless action sequences that look and sound amazing, but there's nothing worth-while to make you feel for anyone involved in the battle. While 'Dunkirk' captures what the nature of the battle was like, it gives no meat to explore the people we see involved. If not for Christopher Nolan's name behind the camera, this film would not be receiving the praise it has gotten. See it for the mesmerizing editing and cinematography (most notably in the fighter-planes lead by an awesome Tom Hardy), but don't expect to be wowed by its story.",Null,5,8,29 July 2017

All it is is a little different story line that can get Hollywood millions or even billions of dollars by the time the series ends. To start of this scheme you have the story of Spider-Man. A normal kid named Peter Parker who becomes Spider-Man and has to help save New York City. Peter Parker falls in love with a girl played by Emma Stone and has to battle a mad- scientist who turns into a giant reptile. What's sad is that audiences are going to experience the cheesiest acting, effects, and dialog in the history of modern-day cinema and are going to get nothing new. Everything in this film is predictable and not a single scene is entertaining. It's all washed up material with horrendous film making to make Hollywood money. In the previous Spider-Man series you had strong themes and motifs and a sense of realism in Peter Parker's life to make the story strong. In The new 'Amazing Spider-Man' series you have childish dialog and not a single strong theme to help make the film powerful. The visuals are even bad!

","Legos are among the most popular and purchased toys in American history. Children (or adults) have built multiple inventions through the premise of setting your mind to create any colorful space-ship or dinosaur imaginable. Of course in this day of age a movie would be made about them. Dubious at first, 'The Lego Movie' made me realize it wasn't just made for the hell of it. It was made with purpose and thought. An ordinary Lego construction worker, thought to be the prophesied 'Special', is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the Lego universe into eternal stasis. Voices from Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, and Morgan Freeman fill the screen with funny sounds and yellow toys who find a way to be more than that. Sure, the film gets stretched out with too much music and an overly thoughtful plot, but this is the film families will enjoy for many years.

Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaughey proves he's a gifted actor with an unforgettable performance.
","Matthew McConaughey is best known for staring in God-awful romantic comedies that no one likes. In 'Dallas Buyers Club,' he makes damn well sure that we know he's a serious actor, and he succeeds in doing so. In one of the most unforgettable and moving performances in recent film history, McConaughey leads this powerful film as real-life aids petite Ron Woodroof, a poor electrician who lives a crazy Texas cowboy lifestyle. After diagnosed with the deadly disease, he challenges the status-quo of the FDA, smuggling in life-saving drugs from around the world and forming his ppm sup[port group/medical organization. Perhaps what makes this performance so stunning isn't just the dramatic weight-loss required by the actor, but how his character isn't someone who you see in movies that much. A drunken electrician from Texas with Aids doesn't sell that often to studio executives, and it's refreshing to see a tale work so well with such an interesting lead character. Jared Leto is also terrific as a fellow Aids patient working with Woodroof. This film not only challenges corruption and examines the obstacles of Aids, but portrays a deeply moving story about a real-life person whose story deserves to be told.",Null,1,1,3 March 2018
American History X," 'American History X' is an important and powerful drama about setting a good example and redemption.
","Having a role model is a great way to have guidance through life to achieve greatness. Following the wrong path and looking up to the wrong version of a truly good human being is a great way to become lost and destroyed. 'American History X' tells the story of two brothers in Venus Beach, California who get enthralled in the modern day Neo-Nazi crime. Derek Vineyard (played blisteringly by Edward Norotn) grew up as a bright young man with strong passions and great qualities. However, being highly influenced by his fathers prejudice views and death caused by an African-American, he turned into a skinhead who after beating three black men in a basketball game is targeted as revenge due to tension of the game. The leader of the men is Derek's main rival, and when Derek storms out shooting, he leaves two brutally killed and one escaped. After wounding one of the two men, he brutally kills him which causes his arrest. After being released from jail, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who highly looks up to Derek as a leader has turned into the younger version of Derek, who is angry due to the higher population of non-Caucasian's in his neighborhood. He looks at Derek as a hero and is full of anger. As Derek tries to teach Danny his new ways, his past comes back to haunt the both of them. Racism is a degrading view that is acted on in our country, and that is the catalyst for this masterpiece. It isn't making a big political statement, it's just showing how some scary people view the diversity of our country and what it does to peoples lives. The brotherhood between Danny and Derek is very touching and shows how important guidance and setting a good example is. The realism and the power this film offsets is what makes this film touching. It doesn't end all happy and clean. It serves as a warning for doing what is right and how your actions can ruin your life. A touch of beauty is portrayed at last to give a little hope though. Edward Norton's performance is so special because he plays two different personalities. The before and post skinhead is a sweet and likable character who you will most likely be moved by. However, when he is shown in flashbacks as a skinhead, he is pure evil and full of dirty words and views. Tony Kaye's directing is very special because of the color and motion he shoots in. During flashbacks in which Derek is a racist, he uses black and white to set the dark mood and color for when he has redeemed himself. The slow-motion scenes are very beautiful and gripping, as well as the cinematography around the beach which serves as a metaphor. The intensity is strong in the scenes that contain necessary violence. This film shows the views of insane people, but shows how 'bad people' can redeem themselves and how that their is reasoning for what they do. The story is also a wake-up call for people down the wrong path and how your life could be ruined due to your actions. This is a very powerful and gripping work of art done perfectly to give the audience the affect they deserve.",Null,0,1,28 June 2014

Hell, there isn't really even a story to this film, but rather just events in Jackie Kennedy's life. How she deals with the assassination of her husband is the pivotal focus, but not even Natalie Portman's spot-on portrayal helps the film.

The Usual Suspects," Like watching a frog that never tells you when he's going to jump...
","Films cab transport our minds and make our brains work extremely hard by using build-up and mystery. In order to appreciate this from of cinema, you have to pay attention! That's not hard to do while viewing 'The Usual Suspects' due to it's brilliant directing by Brian Singer and its unique, leading, mysterious, and shocking screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie that doesn't just make you think and intrigue you for every second of the film, but makes you analyze the crime scene as if you were investigating the films plot yourself. 'The Usual Suspects' revolves around a brutal fire on a large ship leaving only two alive. One named verbal (Kevin Spacey) explains the incident to the FBI explaining how Turkish criminal Kyzer Soze was responsible for the murders of the men on board, and tries to help them find this killer. Using suspects to fit Soze's appearance, four men are investigated. The criminals get involved in a heist that set up a wild conclusion that will leave you speechless. Every criminal, Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, and Kevin Spacey are electrifying and play their parts perfectly. What's so smart about McQuarrie's story is that he's building up a story that could go any direction at any time. he isn't set around one character and one story that continues to move on. Instead he uses five men who could all get into trouble and shift the story like a hurricane. We are filled with mystery and suspense and get a shocking ending that concludes everything that happened and explains all its mysteries, but doesn't leave a stitch unclear. Director Bryan Singer gives elusive shots that always have that pressure and tension built on them even when nothing too important is occurring.

The whole premise of this film feels off, even for an animated movie. Animation is nice because there are no limits to what you can do, but that's also its issue. 'Inside Out' gets carried away and has a weird story that gets too sappy. I can't see children understanding or enjoying this film, it sort of feels like a Pixar film for adults.

No Country for Old Men," 'No Country for Old Men' has a mesmerizing story and shows the history and future of international crime.
","The good, the bad and the victims of crime have always fulfilled the cycle of crime throughout the history of mankind. There are always heroes trying to prevent crime from the ones who cause it. Then there are the victims, the people who are helpless against crime. 'No Country for Old Men' tells the story of three men who all show the cycle of crime. Tommy Lee Jones plays Sheriff Ed Bell, an old lawman in west Texas who is disgusted by modern day crime and fears the damage it will do to him. He represents the good hero in the crime world. Javier Bardem gives a blistering performance as a psychopathic bounty hunter named Anton Chigurh who represents the evil figure in crime. He is after Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) a man hunting Pronghorn in the desert who stumbles across a brutal crime scene and happens to find a case of $2 million that he keeps. Moss represents the victims of crime due to being hunted down by a ruthless criminal, and being a witness to the drug cartels and finding the money that set him off into a terrifying survival test. Anton Chigurh is at full speed in trying to get the money and kill Moss before Sheriff Bell can stop him. The three men are all 'No Country for Old Men' for various reasons. The similarities between these fine characters is brilliant! Even though they all represent different figures of the crime world, they all have the same connections and realizations about their roles in the crime world that make this story impossible to stop thinking about, and tricky to firmly understand. There are many other supporting characters that have the same roles as Sheriff Bell, Anton Chigurh, and Llewellyn Moss that provide a story that keeps moving forward and an interesting theme about how everyone has their own role in crime once incorporated in it. Besides the brilliant similarities and title that connect the main characters, you have world-class film making by The Coen's. The directing is so rich in every shot. Many scenes involving Chigurh hunting down Moss are extremely scary and intense, and the reality they provide in their film makes this film even more powerful and important. Not a scene in this film is useless or unimportant. Every single action and statement can be used to better understand the plot and themes of this deep story, which calls for acute attention by the audience. The tendency of persistence and roles in the world we live in are acted on to show the nature of humankind by all ages, not just the meek. The motivations of all types of people (good, bad, reckless, hasty)are all reflected on to show how evil people go for greed, good people want justice and peace, and victims want safety. The true message is how crime will never end, and how there will always be good and bad, and people will get caught up on the never ending cycle of crime. Joel and Ethan Coen have written a monumental story that has boldness in every way. If people give this film the credit and time it deserves, then they will realize why every character is 'No Country for Old Men' and how each character relates to one another. Besides the confusing aspects, you'll get full-throttle action and intensity with brilliant characters and performances that deserve to be called groundbreaking and classic. This is the greatest story ever told and by far one of the best films of all time. See this before you die!",Null,0,2,30 June 2014
District 9," 'District 9' is one of science fictions' strongest films with a realistic feeling to its genius story that is a poetic.
","Aliens! Film has made audiences reckless over the idea of aliens coming to earth to destroy us. What about Aliens coming to earth for us to destroy them? In futuristic South Africa, multiple districts of aliens are patrolled by humans in order to assure safety. Many aliens came here years ago peacefully, but are not convincing enough to government officials. The government treats them horribly similar to Apartheid in the country years ago. When one government agent (Sharlato Coppley) is exposed to the toxins that cause genetic alteration, he turns into an alien! When forming a relationship with one alien who wants to only take care of her baby and leave the evil government, the two work together in order to help the aliens leave and live in peace. This film has extreme realism to it that make any other sci-fi film look ridiculous. The film interviews its characters to make it feel like a documentary and has perfect visual effects and editing to give visual appeal and keep its genre true to its legacy. Very interesting how the aliens are the victims, and how they are peaceful and a metaphor for discriminated groups such as sexual orientations, genders, or races. Neil Bloomkamp has a brilliant screenplay that isn't cheesy or over the top sci-fi at all. He makes it as realistic as possible which gives it a strong effect and cutting-edge glory. Spectacular visuals are also vital in this film. Gorgeous cinematography that has a very unique looking future and has a genies production design with the space ships.

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Peter Jackson bounces back from his mistakes and delivers a hugely entertaining fantasy epic.
","Tolkien would be bowing his head if he saw the second installment in Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' trilogy. When there is only one book written by the legendary writer, Peter Jackson decided to adapt Tolkien's fantasy novel into three films. Not the wisest choice some may say, but hey, he makes the second installment extremely fun and entertaining. Peter Jackson ups the visual elements from the first in 'The Desolation of Smaug' to create some truly stunning CGI and action sequences. He uses tons of creepy and terrifying creatures to fight off against dwarfs, elves, and of course, Gandalf while also having a great sequence with a scene-stealing, fire-breathing dragon. After successfully crossing over the Misty Mountains, Thorin and Company must seek aid from a powerful stranger before taking on the dangers of Mirkwood Forest--without their Wizard. If they reach the human settlement of Lake-town it will be time for the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract with the dwarfs. The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and burglar Baggins must seek out the Secret Door that will give them access to the hoard of the dragon Smaug. Jackson also dials-down on the weak humor and ends up replacing it with action. He appears to the geeky base whop truly love fantasy, not worrying too much about pleasing fans of the book. While one film would have probably been smarter, we get to see extended sequences of fantastic action and get tons of excitement in he wonderful world of Middle Earth that we all love.",Null,0,2,7 June 2016

","If you can get past the gorgeous and artistic cinematography you may be able to behold the tremendous depth in 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.' Even though the title's too long, this film stands out as one of the best of 2007 and one of the best of the 21st century. Writer/Director Andrew Dominik brings the historical tale of outlaw Jesse James to life. He examines this legendary killer through the eyes of Robert Ford, a young man who worships this figure and ends up being a part of his group before resenting him. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck playing these two men is a match made in heaven. Both men, specifically Affleck, deliver spot-on performances who nail every aspect of their multi-layered characters, bringing this excellent story to life. Taking place in rural America during the 1800s, one would expect opportunities for good visual and production elements. Make no mistake, Dominik embraces every opportunity he gets. Few films create production designs and costumes that feel so authentic and don't appear as if made for the screen. The true eye-opener is the cinematography, capturing the American West and Midwest like no other film has done before. What you get with this film is a story and a portrait. History and the present. Idolization and criminalization are still major occurrences in today's society, as it was when outlaws who could steal the most trains roamed the earth.",Null,0,0,6 June 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'The Hobbit' doesn't live up the the Middle earth phenomenon, even with a 48 frames per second camera.
","Nearly a decade after Peter Jackson finished making the final film in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy (arguably the greatest three films put on film), Jackson adapts yet another Tokein novel called 'The Hobbit.' Jackson being a businessman decided to make three films out of this book. 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' isn't nearly sophisticated enough as 'The Lord of the Rings.' We start off with the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, writing about his adventure to Frodo. The majestic wizard, Gandalf, seeks Bilbo to venture out into the rigorous terrain of Middle Earth with 13 dwarfs to take home the dwarf kingdom known as Erebor. Bilbo gives in, leaving us in a world of fantasy. Not only does this film lack Jackson's spectacular directing of Middle earth, but not one visual element here is strong. 'The Lord of The Rings' has some of the greatest CGI in history. 'The Hobbit' looks like an animated kids film most of the time. Some scenes even look like drawings! The scenery isn't breathtaking at all, almost impossible to not recognize the green screen affect. With so many unique creatures, it's sad to see lame CGI. Fantasy films often get stereotyped in a good way for having elaborate costumes. The costumes look like something out of a school play. 'The Lord of the Rings' did a perfect job making the story intelligent and brilliant. Jackson adapted the trilogy to add intensity and artistic talent. Here, were stuck with annoying humor and almost childish entertainment. He tries to make the scenes as long as he can, knowing he has to make two more films. He overdoes the fantasy element without adding any beauty of rich brilliance relating to different worlds. The only creature that provides any fun is the mesmerizing Gollum. Still looking the same, Gollum comes out of nowhere for a sequence you won't forget. With ugly orcs, viscous wolves, and stupid talking trolls, it's fresh to see a familiar face. Jackson does do a good job giving us exposition and a backstory without boring us. He also packs in a lot of action that is better than seeing any of these obnoxious singing dwarfs. With Gandalf as the main lead here, we see him save the day all the time and Bilbo as more of a supporting character. 'The Hobbit' has great scenes in the book. I don't understand why Jackson didn't make the story into a beautiful 3-hour film with groundbreaking visual appeal. Instead, he went for the money and starts off with one childish, overly-involved, self-acclaimed disappointment.",Null,2,4,26 November 2014
Saving Private Ryan," 'Saving Private Ryan' is the most realistic and powerful war film ever made!
","Sacrifice is often challenging for men in dangerous positions. No eight film characters besides the eight soldiers in Steven Spielberg's war masterpiece 'Saving Private Ryan' have dedicated more sacrifice in the history of film. WW II was a harsh war that caused many fatalities and tragedies. Entire families like the Ryan boys were sent out to war. In 'Saving Private Ryan' we see four brothers loose 75% of their legacy, leaving only Private James Ryan to live. When Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent out with seven other soldiers to rescue Private Ryan so that the Ryan family would have one last child to hang on two. As the eight men try and rescue Private Ryan somewhere in the battlefields of Germany, they encounter extreme war situations causing fatalities and conflict between the eight men. Many argue with each other, loose hope, show strong emotions, and complain about how the eight of them have to risk their lives for one man. However, some positivism is derived from their mission. Many friendships are formed between soldiers as they connect with each other and help each other through battle. Steven Spielberg's directing is extremely superb and magnificence. He takes you into the line of war liken no filmmaker, and has extremely intense and realistic battle sequences to show how much sacrifice the brave men of WW II gave in order to promote peace and liberty. The battle sequences are perfectly made with amazing editing, sound, and effects that are entertaining for the powerful soul purpose and to make the story strong. Bravo to the actors Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Jeremy Davis, and Tom Sizemore for giving powerful performances as soldiers throughout the entire film, and never getting off guard in the film. The main theme of 'Saving Private Ryan' is not only to give the first hand experience of WW II battle brought to life, but to show a story of sacrifice. The mission to save Private Ryan is a metaphor for how soldiers throughout history give of themselves for others, and how their sacrifice can never be thanked enough.

Szpilman goes through many terrifying situations with the Germans, and has many miraculous survival events that allow him to keep striving for a better life. Many powerful Holocaust images and scenes involving cruelty and violence are portrayed brilliantly to give the film a powerful nature that can be a lead up to the beautiful and cheerful later results. Roman Polanski directs 'The Pianist' spectacularly, allowing history to be brought to life in a way that's wrapped around a compelling story with talented film making. Roman Polanski guides every member of this film to achieve success and works terrifically with his gifted actors. Adrien Brody not only looks and sounds the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman, but allows his true story to be honored and not forgotten after the hardship he faced. Brody's facial expressions and meek looking figure allow him to portray Szpillman perfectly. Hardship is a terrible road to go down through, and stories that take place during huge events such as the holocaust can be hard to make aware to the public. 'The Pianist' is a story about one man trapped into a large nightmare, and the fact that it is a major motion picture allows that brave Pianist to allow his life-long legacy and brilliant survival skills to be honored and respected.",Null,0,0,5 July 2014

The cast is powered with A-list actors such as Ralph Finnes and Jude Law, but not one actor gives a performance that's noteworthy. The film has its moments of subtle little laughs, but it relies heavily on its art-departments such as costumes and production design, which hold it back from becoming a film with an actual level of substance.

Along comes young Abigail (Emma Stone), Sarah's cousin, who works in service for the queen and soon forms a close bond with her, infuriating a jealous Sarah and triggering a tense conflict between the two women over the queen's attention.In what sounds like a generic timepiece, director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster) generates one of the wittiest and most original films of the year. From the very beginning, The Favourite promises a fulfilling and unconventional film-viewing experience. What makes this film work so beautifully is how it uses wickedly irreverent and brutally honest comedy appropriately, not overusing it to the point it becomes unrealistic. Instead, the film plays out comically in a natural way, our characters acting and being presented as naturally flawed people instead of just their titles as queens, servants, or wealthy lords.The tension that rises builds so organically and is executed to perfection by our three main characters. Olivia Colman as Queen Anne is a riot to observe, her outrageous behavior and erratic nature the perfect combination of fun and unpredictability. Emma Stone, an actress who I personally find irritable in her films, is charming, deceiving, and hilarious, her combative scenes with Rachel Weisz exuberant and show-stopping. Weisz, channeling a woman as cold as ice, is at her all time best. Witnessing these three brilliant performances match up against each other forms multiple scenes of twisted comedic gold and tense conflicts that explode into something truly special.Lanthimos does a good job reminding his audience to laugh at his characters and not with them throughout their quirky journey. We're never told who to root for or who to side with, instead presented with various women whose actions and personalities you loathe, yet would want to have a laugh with. Lanthimos also excels at not drowning us in historic detail, instead focusing on the people involved with the historical conflicts occurring and not the conflicts themselves. The unconventional storytelling methods and charming vision The Favourite possesses is a wildly original work that while looks pretty (the costumes and production design are stunning and realistic), presents a disastrous mess that quietly unfolds into subtle chaos.",Null,3,9,17 January 2019
Revolutionary Road," 'Titanic' stars clash it out in a dramatic marital piece about two ordinary spouses.
","Marriage is a beautiful and often stressful bond between two people that allows us to tests ourselves and express our love. Cinema reflects this but also focuses on the hardship a married couple can endure. Sam Mendes being the paperboy for this directorial role worked with his wife Kate Winslet and her old 'Titanic' partner Leonardo Dicaprio in 'Revolutionary Road'. April (Winslet) and Frank (Dicaprio) Wheeler are a middle class married couple living in suburban Connecticut,1955. The two met at an elegant party years ago and have been in lover ever since. After they discuss their future plans, they find themselves being stuck in between and the opposite of what they thought they would be like. Frank is an overworked New York City businessman while April is a stay at home mom for their two kids. The couple soon realizes they must change their life as they quarrel and support each other throughout their battle. This film didn't live up to the extreme drama it promised and the rich writing I thought I would have heard. Instead, it is a slow-moving and mostly powerful look at a marriage that is similar to other marriages portrayed in other films. April and Frank are not enjoyable characters at all, and there aren't many supporting characters to allow us to escape from the two of them. Were stuck with them for the entire time. Sam Mendes doesn't keep his beautiful craftsmanship that he had in 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' in this one. He makes a dry film that focuses too much on the production design and not enough on a detailed marriage. The film isn't juicy enough in the sense that there isn't much moving about it and that not much happens until the last half hour to really grasp your emotions. Winslet and Dicaprio are brilliant actors here. The first hour and a half they give still performances, but the last half of and hour is pure dramatic acting with one particularly mesmerizing lengthy argument towards the end between the two of them. Dicaprio screams his head off where Winslet uses her facial expressions to shows her feelings. There is also a surprise cameo by Michael Shannon that will shock you. He speaks his mind and might even show what Frank and April are unwillingly wanting to say. This film shows an unoriginal marital story that has its strong moments and impeccable acting.",Null,0,0,2 September 2014
Foxcatcher," Chilling! A stunning and cereal achievement.
","'Foxcatcher' isn't a sports movie. It's a movie about sports. Thi is the kind of film that gives you a knot in your stomach for the entire film even though nothing terrifying is coming until the end. The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont (Steve Carell) as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo play the brothers Mark and Dave Schukltz. They each give strong and intense performances. However, what makes this movie especially note-worthy is the shocking and legendary performance by Steve Carell. That's right, the hysterical Michael Scott plays a creepy and chilling wrestling coach worth billions. Carell's movements, eye contact, soft speech and makeup give him a charisma like Anthony Hopkins in 'The Silence of the lambs.' He gives an absolutely jaw- dropping and career turning performance of a lifetime. Bennett Miller as the director shoots each scene with a kind of subtle intensity that really hasn't been done before. He films his characters' interactions perfectly to make us engrossed with each man. This male-dominated film tackles down the ideas of ambition and makes you wonder weeks after you view it. 'Foxcatcher' is a poignant film that delivers both visually and mentally and will engross you in a way that few films can.",Null,1,2,22 November 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Somehow cheesier than the original, but still entertaining!
","No matter how cliché the story line gets, or how many suspense sequences that have been done millions of other times in other films appear on screen, you can't deny how much we all love seeing gigantic dinosaurs scare the living daylights out of moviegoers. These ancient and magnificent beasts are brought back to life with the directed craft of no one other than Steven Spielberg, the movie God. With the huge success of 'Jurassic Park' in 1993, Spielberg keeps the story going strong with 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park.' Four years after the failure of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, John Hammond reveals to Ian Malcolm that there was another island ('Site B') on which dinosaurs were bred before being transported to Isla Nublar. Left alone since the disaster, the dinosaurs have flourished, and Hammond is anxious that the world see them in their 'natural' environment before they are exploited. Yes, there are villains trying to exploit dinosaurs. How cruel. We continue to see the scientific approach to balance the epic chase scenes and the terrifying T-Rex sneaking into tents and eating scientists left and right. Sadly, we don't get the same visual effects as we did in 1993. They seem to be a tad less in quality. However, who cares! They're good enough to scare the heck out of us and wrap our minds in a world where even the ridiculous and dimwitted plot of a squeal is still ridiculously entertaining and a joyous thrill ride full of razor sharp teeth and ear-piercing roars.",Null,41,54,7 June 2015
City of God," 'City of God' is a mesmerizing and honest look at people surrounded by crime and the path's it causes us to lead.
","Every location on earth isn't 100% the same all throughout its area. Brazil for instance has been praised as having some of the most vibrant beauty, fun people, interesting culture aspects, and fun times anyone can ever experience. However, in the City of God there is absolute chaos and tragedy. 'City of God' is a compelling and tragic true story of about two boys growing up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro who are vulnerable to a brutal and indulging world and take on two different paths in life. Rocket is a good-hearted young man who despises the City of God for it's filth, violence, and misery. Rocket dreams about becoming a photographer in order to show the terrifying world in which he and others life in to expose the City of God to raise awareness. The gang he is targeting is led by Lil Ze, a ruthless drug dealer who owns the city and just so happens to be the other boy the story follows. Rocket tries to take him down, which proves to be even more challenging than growing up in this unrelenting city. People are destined to make a change in their surroundings no matter what moral path they follow. That's what we learn from this exuberant crime story, that people are motivated to do good and do bad in order to change their lives and earn respect and power. Rocket tries to use his ability to do good, where Lil Ze uses his power to do evil. The city in which the two boys live in appears absolutely awful, but deep down Rocket represents hope in not just a ruthless city, but in any devastating location. There is always a chance of hope. The two boys are shown as they go through their lives from a very young age to their twenties. The story reflects growing up and the choices we make as children can affect our lives in the future. Director Fernando Meirelles captures the slums of Brazil in an absolutely groundbreaking way. Meirelles portrays a hopeless city and uses a tab of hope in this wonderful script to represent how hope is always in the most depressing locations. On top of that you have spectacular cinematography with a beautiful musical score to help visually portray this devastating/beautiful story. Harsh violence and thorough character development get you so wrapped up in the main characters that you'll have extremely strong feelings for them once your just a half hour into the film. 'City of God' is a tough film to watch, but if you look at it from a climatic point of view and see what the future of Rio looks like, you''l be relatively happy and realize that as long as their are people like Rocket trying to make a difference in the world, their will always be a brighter future stored in.",Null,0,2,26 July 2014
Legend," Tom Hardy does great work in a poor movie.
","It's a shame that when a gifted and charismatic actor like Tom Hardy plays two twin brothers and gives two different, memorable performance in a pointless, dry film. 'Legend' tells the story of the Kray twins, two gangsters during the 1960s in London. The film tells a very one-dimensional, unfulfilling tale that doesn't explore these brothers intimately enough, yet wastes so much time on unimportant details that bring the plot down and make the film drag. With a run-time of over 130 minutes, 'Legend' could have been trimmed down by about 20 minutes and given a more talented writer and director than Brian Helgeland to create a story that doesn't just focus on their actor's performance but gives a story that is both entertaining and rewarding.",Null,1,2,22 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," The best Marvel movie yet.
","Getting nearly every Marvel superhero together to fight a tyrannical titan who wants to wipe out half of life on earth is the kind of material Popcorn films dream of.

As someone who isn't big on superhero movies in general, I was surprised how much fun this movie was. Maybe with Superheros stand-alone films, the energy and excitement aren't really there. However, get them all together and you realize how each superhero complements each other and how as a team they generate a wild film. Marvel took more risks and put more energy into this film than all of their other films combined it seems. With an ending that will go down as one of the most shocking in film history, 'Infinity War' is a wildly fun and exciting film that will leave you eager for more.",Null,1,2,30 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's ode to Hollywood.
","We live in an entertainment era today where virtually every film produced is either a remake, a continuation of an ancient series, or recycled story bits put together to make a film lacking any freshness. Leave it to the biggest film-lover in the world and one of the greatest filmmakers of all time to craft a film that not only eloquently reflects on the changing world surrounding pop culture and the entertainment industry but to create one of the most original, charismatic films of all time.Quentin Tarantino is known for his incredible dialogue, shocking violence, intense action, and quirky characters. His films always find the humor surrounding everything, no matter how uncomfortable they may get. No working filmmaker today can generate such consistent, heart-stopping tension as Tarantino, nor can anyone excel in bringing out the fun in so many serious, gritty subjects.Four years after the grizzly and wildly entertaining western 'The Hateful Eight,' Tarantino transports us back in time to the late 1960s in sunny Los Angeles, California during the peak of Hollywood. In what is accurately being referred to as a love letter to Hollywood, Tarantino creates an ode to the time where Hollywood was roaring in success, where movie stars were respected icons, and where several in the industry were unable to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.'Once Upon a Time In Hollywood' follows former TV actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he and his stunt man Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) navigate through Hollywood in 1968-69. Dalton is a fading actor known for playing the fictional TV cowboy Jake Cahill in 'Bounty Law,' a spaghetti western series. Rick may be able to afford a house in Los Angeles and get roles regularly, but he hasn't had a break to become a recognized star and fears the finish line of his career is within reach. It also doesn't help that he lives next door to Sharron Tate, the real-life actress married to successful film director Roman Polanski.Tarantino once again manipulates history to explore an alternate reality that still hangs on to the culture and environment of the time he chronicles. Unlike any film he has ever done, Tarantino creates a testament to two characters and a period that, while lacking a concrete story, in able to execute the film with a perfect vision filled with memorable dialogue and characters.No other director can get away with altering history and creating a film that doesn't follow a traditional narrative better than Tarantino. 'Once Upon a Time In Hollywood' is his tribute to the films he grew up with, using his flawed, quirky characters as a mechanism to express the vibrant culture in Hollywood at the time.Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were the only two actors who could lead the film and generate the effect they do. Despite being the two biggest kings of Hollywood and two of the last truly great 'movie stars,' DiCaprio and Pitt have blazing chemistry as two struggling players in the entertainment game that ignites the screen in witty humor and tremendous fun. They're a dynamic duo whose marriage is an instant screen classic.Brad Pitt steals the show as Cliff Booth. While DiCaprio convinces us as a failing, dim-witted actor unlike his other dramatic roles, Pitt plays a low-life bum with an edge better than anyone. He's every ounce of the word 'cool' and his character is one of Tarantino's most creative. Expect to see him as a serious contender for Best Supporting Actor at the next Academy Awards.Many have pondered why Sharron Tate wasn't as prominent of a figure in the film, but her existence in the film is very strategic. Tate serves as an idea rather than a complex character. She represents the success of Hollywood and is a stark contrast to Rick and Cliff. Margot Robbie captures the bubbly, lively spirit of Tate beautifully and her character is a terrific tribute to the late actress.Many are wondering how Charles Manson's cult will be invoked throughout the film. While not an essential storyline, the Manson Cult serves as a terrific conflict element that I wish was further explored. Tarantino spends so much time with Rick and Cliff that I wish we got to explore the other supporting characters introduced throughout the film more intimately, especially the intriguing members belonging to a violent cult.Quentin doesn't withstand from an absence of violence, and he includes a gruesome, cartoonishly brutal sequence towards the end. While very exciting and at times funny, the actual violence is too over-the-top. I would have preferred a more dynamic action sequence towards the end involving more characters that played out like the spaghetti westerns depicted in Rick Dalton's roles, for this would have been not only more exciting but could have resulted in traditional on-screen gun action instead of hand-to-hand brutality.The Los Angeles Tarantino creates in mesmerizing. This is a filmmaker with such an eye for detail that it becomes infectious through his production design. Master cinematographer Robert Richardson has such a focused, vivacious camera that captures the vision Tarantino has perfectly. Both men can make the seemingly unimportant and calm entertaining and intriguing, a characteristic few films contain nowadays.Quentin Tarantino once again has proved he is a confident filmmaker with tremendous storytelling talents. His wisdom in directing and writing is expressed in every frame of 'Once Upon a Time' in addition to his lead actors carrying all the years of their experience into their roles. This film isn't just a story, it's a vision. A vision of what Hollywood was like and how it's changing.After I walked out of the theatre, I paid attention to what other films were being played. Almost all were remakes or sequels of some sorts, none sparkling in originality. Tarantino has consistently avoided the inevitability of how movies aren't what they used to be, how Hollywood is more concerned with making profits instead of making original films that are fresh for audiences.'Once Upon a Time In Hollywood' may not have the tension, action, or intensity that other films from Quentin Tarantino contain. However, what this film does have is a rich identity, one with a purpose dedicated to exploring arguably the most critical time in Hollywood. Everyone apart of the film is fully on board with Tarantino's vision, the result being a film like no other that will be celebrated for generations.",Null,40,66,30 July 2019
Django Unchained," 'Django Unchained' is the most creative and entertaining film of all time!
","Wow! Quentin Tarantino has been one of the most creative filmmakers since 'Reservoir Dogs' and proves he's even better with 'Django Unchained.' Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave turned bounty hunter after being freed by German bounty hunter Dr.King Schultz, played amazingly by Christoph Waltz. Schultz agrees to give Django his freedom and find his enslaved wife (Kerry Washington) if he helps kill certain evil people on his hit list. Every second of this film is extremely entertaining. Tarantino's dialog is so rich that it has a sense of poetry in it. He adds edge of your seat tension, brilliant humor, shocking action, and superb characters to make this the best film of 2012. His creativity in his writing is so unique that many people will and won't appreciate. Many people are disturbed by the fact that he made a slave a bounty hunter to kill evil white men. It takes a lot of guts to make historical fiction in such a unique way, and Quentin makes it in a way so awesome and entertaining. Jamie Foxx is a royal bad ass as Django. His character shows his loyalty to his wife, and his skills by shooting guys quickly with his gun while wearing cowboy hats and a boot. Christoph Waltz is spectacular as the charming bounty hunter who's an absolute sharp-shooter. Everything he says is delightful and is one of Tarantino's best characters. Leonardo Dicaprio as Calvin Candie is both evil and funny at the same time. He creates extreme tension and delivers a unique performance. Samuel L.Jackson is hilarious as Stephen the slave, and gives his best performance since Pulp Fiction. The filmmakers Quentin teamed up with to make this film have absolute talent. The costumes, sound, cinematography, editing, and setting make this film even more special by bringing this film to life visually. There's plenty of great action that can get quite graphic at times to make this a classic western. This film isn't meant to be gratuitous or realistic so to speak, but to show the classic western theme that's still original. Quentin Tarantino is a pure genies. He makes the word creative go even farther as he takes these interesting plots and delivers you a pure cinematic masterpiece that will leave you hungry for more.

Get Out," Daring. Bold. Creative. Wickedly Entertaining.
","Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' is a fresh and creative modern-day classic. Tackling heavy themes of racism and slavery, Peele transforms a seemingly simple drama into a crazy, heart-stopping, and supremely funny thriller that consistently leaves you wound up. Daniel Kaluuya plays a black man who has to meet his white girlfriends family, and as many black men would feel in this situation, is uncomfortable and nervous. The instant this film starts ticking, you won't be able to escape and get this out of your head (no pun intended). Jordan Peele shines a a new director and embodies a spectacular style and wit into his storytelling methods.

Drive," 'Drive' is a shockingly magnificent film with some of the best directing you'll ever see! You won't know what hit you with this masterpiece!
","Everyone in life is driven by something. 2011's best film is a film by director Nicolas Winding Refn called 'Drive' about a Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver for criminals. The film opens with a car chase, so you know it's awesome! The driver is played by Ryan Gosling who doesn't have a name! When the driver meets his neighbor played by Carey Mulligan, he falls for her and learns about her convict husband being released from prison. When he is released, Driver gets involved with his crime in order to protect his neighbor and her son. The violence and intensity that spurs off will leave you shocked and calls for one hell of a good time. Nicolas Winding Refn shoots this film beautifully with directing that is new to cinema and contains noir elements as well as sheer beauty. Many shockingly violent scenes still contain that charm Refn adds in his directing to make this film monumental. Other intense action scenes containing shocking violence have other strong elements such as love, greed, and failing of connections in them. It isn't violent for the bloody sake of it at all. The theme of driving yourself for love and others is what's reflected on in this film. 'Drive' has perfect editing, cinematography and sound to make this film visually appealing. The acting isn't the key element in 'Drive' with the exception of Albert Brooks as a brutal mobster that Ryan Gosling's character gets caught up with during the wild drive he has protecting his neighbor. Brooks gives a raw performance who does shocking things that feel so real and flawless as Joe Pesci in 'Goodfellas.' The scenery of L.A. in which this film takes place is spectacular, especially when it has an alternative original song to boost the scene through the streets. 'Drive' is an intense thriller with gorgeous directing that is monumental and triggers the excellence and originality of this gem of a film. You won't know what hit you.",Null,1,3,30 June 2014
2012," '2012' is a disaster film that ends up making a disaster of itself.
","The mythical theory of the world coming to an end in 2012 frightened some people so much that they called NASA on December 21 (the day it was supposed to end) wondering if they were going to be safe, watched bogus documentaries on various science channels about the end of the blue planet and now paid money to see a horrendous film about this ridiculous theory. The theory was that based on the ending of the Mayan calendar on December 21,2012 there would be mass destruction from our universe entering our atmosphere and totally destroy us. Many scientists and cultural examiners noted that they had no evidence of anything destructive happening in our future and that the Mayan's had many other ways of calculating time besides a calendar. So why the hell did we make a movie about this? It's literally John Cusack and his family trying to survive various catastrophic events for over two-and a half hours! I wonder why good actors like Woody Harelson, Chiwitel Ejiofer and Amanda Peet had small roles in such a degrading film. This film isn't even a fun popcorn film where you can just be entertained. It drags and drags forever and doesn't have one shocking or entertaining scene. Everything you think will happen in every scene happens as well as having the disasters so in your face that the suspense is silenced. The directing by Roland Emerich is horrific. Emerich uses the cheesiest visual effects and worst CGI that result in using terrible sound and horrendous cinematography. There's no strong message about family, which could have been used to provide some emotional aspect to this disastrous plot. With all the poor film-making you have John Cusack giving a lame performance and after seeing every landmark and natural disaster combine with each other for 158 minutes, you'll get a little tired. The only thing I took out of watching '2012' was that the world could end any second and if that's the case I sure don't want this film being the last film I ever see. This film alone is worst than the end of the world.",Null,1,3,11 August 2014
Room," 'Room' is life affirming, a work of art both moving and beautiful.
","There are only a handful of films that I can think about during a regular day that get me lost back into the theater to re-experience the beauty and magic of those films. 'Room' is one of them. This is a film that can transform your emotions so quickly and so authentically that you forget your watching a film. 'Room' controls you and manipulates your feelings to a level that no film has done before. We enter the film in a tiny room, which is actually a shed in a man's backyard that Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) have been held captive for seven years. Joy is repeatedly assaulted by the man (which is how Jack was conceived) and is trapped in a nightmare. The two make the best of their situation, and once they escape, try and see the world for the beautiful and larger room that it truly is. Let's start by saying that Brie Larson gives perhaps the greatest performance by an actor in cinematic history. Her emotions and realistic approach to her character are so full of detail and has the ability to put you to tears due to her character's tragic situation and her remarkable comeback. This is the best actress alive today. Jack Tremblay also makes a startling revelation as one of the world's most talented young actors. 'Room' is a beautiful film with spectacular direction by Lenny Abrahmson, who shifts from beautiful scenes between a mother and son, to a heart-pounding escape, and finally to the powerful and beautiful struggles and joys that life has to offer. 'Room' will alter your feelings greatly throughout, but will leave you speechless due to the breathtakingly beautiful writing by Emma Donoughe and the glorious implications of hope and beauty in the world.",Null,3,10,22 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The most epic story of all time lives on in a groundbreaking sequel.
","'The Lord of the Rings' lives on and continues the story in a way that helps us understand our unique characters and Middle Earth and to better appreciate the story. 'The Two Towers' is the second out of three 'Lord of the Rings' masterpieces coming after 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and prior to 'The Return of the King' the best out of the three. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' brought us into the core story of two hobbits, Frodo and Sam who are to destroy the evil ring of Saroun and vanquish evil in Mordor. Frodo and Sam are continuing their path into Mordor to destroy the ring with the help of a very different creature named Gollum who was cursed by the ring and knows the path to Mordor. This causes tension between Frodo and Sam before they get caught up in their most challenging path yet. Arragorn, Legolas and Gimley encounter the soldiers of Rohan after searching for Pipen and Marry after they were captured by Saruman's orcs. They enter Rohan and help the poisoned King Theoden help his people from danger with the assistance of an old friend. Pipen and Marry escaped into a lush forest home to tree creatures who have been victims of Saruman as well. All these magical stories come crashing down into intense battles, heart-warming character encounters, beautiful friendhsip, bravery and more. 'The Two Towers' is a much more entertaining film than we have seen in recent years. We already have the main plot covered from the first film, so now director Peter Jackson takes us into Middle Earth in a more uncharted and rugged way. We meet the kingdom of Rohan and see them fight in an epic battle between Saruman's menacing orcs after we already get frequent action sequences prior. There are also many new characters we meet that all provide something to the plot. They are not just there to make the story have more conflict, but rather they serve a vital purpose into this epic plot. The new creatures we see are so shocking when we finally see them. Walking and talking trees, dragons, gollum, Uruk-hai orcs and more. Peter Jackson worked extremely hard on making every element plausible and magnificent in order to bring Tolkien's pages to life. He uses vivid camera work with either extreme beauty or ominous vibes. The visual effects are the stuff film schools will look at and read about hundreds of years from now where the editing and cinematography is second to none. This isn't only a genius story brought back to life in a magnificent way but a visual phenomenon that cannot be missed. 'The Lord of the Rings' are three stories we have to experience sometime in your life. Cinema is by far the best way to do so and with 'The Two Towers' your able to experience an even more far side of Middle earth like you couldn't imagine.",Null,2,4,30 August 2014
The Lion King," 'The Lion King' remake is a remake too breathtaking to resist
","Few films are as widely recognized and celebrated as the original 'Lion King,' for its stunning animation and creative heartfelt story was a wonderful combination that audiences of all ages could marvel at. I'll always remember being a young child and watching the 1994 Disney classic on VHS, choking up whenever Mufasa fatally gets pushed off a cliff and into a stampede of wildebeest as his son Simba watches in terror.It's no secret that Disney, the most successful and powerful entertainment company in the world, has been remaking several of its animated classics and turning them into live-action blockbusters. We've seen films like 'Cinderella,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'The Jungle Book,' 'Dumbo,' 'Alice In Wonderland,' 'Peter Pan,' and most recently 'Aladdin' get turned into live-action films and 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Mulan,' and 'Lady and the Tramp' upcoming, making it inevitable that 'The Lion King' would be given the redo treatment as well.It's unfortunate for Disney fans that we have to rely solely on remakes of past films for the future of its legacy. Disney has endless creative potential in its ability to create new films that are both visually stunning and emotionally captivating, especially nowadays with the staggering improvements in visual effects and digital technology. Relying on the past, Disney has seen a massive dip over the years in its originality, making the studio seem unable to create any fresh magic.The remake of 'The Lion King' tells the same story as it did 25 years ago, the script seemingly copied and pasted from the original and slightly tweaked. The film follows an almost shot for shot similarity to its predecessor with the same score, making it lack any originality or soul of itself.However, while I am not a fan of Disney's reliance on remaking past films for guaranteed profits, the beauty of 'The Lion King' is too breathtaking to resist. Few films have been as visually spectacular, each image appearing as if viable for being in an art museum. Not only do the various creatures and African savannah landscapes inspire a deep sense of wonder, the level of detail in each shot in unparalleled. Director Jon Favreau has created a vibrant African world that makes you want to go on a safari. Not only do the animals look real, but they also move and operate as the creatures that roam the plains of the Dark Continent in precisely the same fashion. There were times where it felt like I was witnessing a BBC nature documentary and not a live-action film.While feeling very much like a remake and not taking any creative leaps to make a fresh film, this is a 'Lion King' that still has bursting energy and spirit, the visual brilliance instilling a sensational feeling that no other Disney experience has ever captured. Each character is voiced perfectly, most notably John Oliver as Zazu, Beyonce as Nala (the Queen playing a queen, only fitting), Seth Rogen as Pumba, and Billy Eichner as Timon. James Earl Jones returns for the voice as Mufasa, a role only he can play, for his speaking role as Mufasa is too iconic to replace. Donald Glover is the only poorly picked actor, his voice as Simba unenergetic and not possessing the level of depth to be a voice character.It seems that Jon Favreau made the film solely for the upgrade in visual effects and digital technology, which one could argue isn't a worthy cause to remake an entire film. While the stunning imagery wasn't quite enough to win me over completely, they created a truly remarkable film experience.It is a bit challenging to blend realistic looking animals with dialogue, at times it being a bit awkward when they speak due to the eccentric voices coming out of the stoic wildlife's mouths. It also poses the challenge of making the film emotional. The original 'Lion King' made each cartoon creature bubbly and did a masterful job of making the animals human-like with their facial expressions and movements, while now we see animals look so real that it seems impossible for them to be human-like and emotional and not like actual wildlife.'The Lion King' feels very much like a remake, for virtually everything except the change from animation to digital live-action and the characters' voices are the same. I don't encourage Disney to continue remaking all of their past films, but with 'The Lion King,' they won me over. I couldn't resist being blown away by what was on screen and from start to finish I was completely entertained despite knowing what would happen.This is a remake that may not have much soul and doesn't capture the creativity of the original, yet the enhancements in visual effects and thought-out direction make this a remake worth seeing and an adventure for the eyes.",Null,0,4,28 July 2019

Years after a plague kills most of humanity and transforms the rest into monsters, Will Smith in New York City struggles valiantly to find a cure while struggling to survive from the infected creatures that come out at night. With his only companion being a magnificent German Shepherd, we see the stress and isolation way down on this brave characters. Director Francis Lawrence plays with you mentally as he adds super-cool action sequences and provokes your mind with unpredictable flashes of terror and peril. Through gripping and terrifying chase scenes that feel authentic, and stunning cinematography and editing, 'I Am Legend' proves sci-fi can have meaning and can hurt like a kick in the face. Will Smith gives a dynamite performance that shows the soul of a man. The flashbacks are relevant and emotional, the production design is jaw-dropping... there really isn't a bad thing to say about this blockbuster.",Null,1,2,31 March 2015
A Quiet Place," John Krasinski enters the ring of talented first-time directors.
","'A Quiet Place' is the kind of film you start off and end with on the edge of your seat, eager for the next rush of intensity to grip you. It's not necessarily the most original or creative horror film you've ever seen, but it's a superbly made and viciously entertaining rush of adrenalin from John Krasinski. It may be hard to imagine Jim from 'The Office' as a horror director, but from the first shot of the film it's clear he not only knows what he's doing bending the camera, but he excels at it. Emily Blunt also delivers a grueling performance filled with ferocity and rich emotions that give this film the weight it needs to make it work. While it could have been longer, 'A Quiet Place' is as entertaining and well-m,adew of a horror film as they come.",Null,3,5,29 May 2018
22 Jump Street," '22 Jump Street' is a rushed comedy that doesn't deliver many laughs.
","It's a squeal kinda spoofing sequels. '22 Jump Street' is the sequel to the 2012 film '21 Jump Street' where Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play undercover cops trying to investigate a drug dealer at a high school. The trailer looked absolutely hilarious, but ended for a huge disappointment. The film had a hilarious opening and ending, but a flat middle. Now in '22 Jump Street' undercover cops Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) investigate another drug in college. Except this time, we never have anything hilarious. We get a clever opening that was funnier in the trailer, one very uncomfortable and funny scene from Jonah Hill, an outrageous coincidence with Ice Cube and... that's about it. There's too many forced jokes that are some flat and weak and have been told millions of times. This one is structured almost identically to '21 Jump Street' which deprives us of refreshing laughs. There are long action sequences with fast humor that is just painful to watch and hardly any material for these talented comedians to work with. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller didn't work with their co-writers on making a final draft, instead the first things they wrote are what they used. We can tell! The comedy is so plane and simple and we don't even get dumb and pointless humor, which is the best! After seeing replayed jokes and extended action scenes similar o the first one, we get very tired of seeing this film try and stick it out. I will say that the spoof on the ending credits of making different Jump Street films was clever. We keep hearing Ice Cube say 'You two sons of bitches are going to-' and then a various establishment where they must fight crime. There were probably 50 different Jump Streets mentioned in the credits, which I hope never get made.",Null,6,14,11 August 2014
Call Me by Your Name," Life-Affirming- A Beautiful Masterpiece.
","Luca Guadagnino's beautiful and heartbreaking masterpiece is a film nearly everyone can relate to. We've all had feelings of passionate love that end up turning into depression and sorrow once things crumble. 'Call Me by Your Name,' a poetic testament to first love, is a perfect film with some of the most emotional and powerful content in recent film history. Timothy Chalamet shines as Elio, a teenager who spends his summer with his family in Northern Italy where his father (a superb Michael Stuhlbarg) teaches a new anthropology graduate student each year. Elio falls for the graduate student Oliver, a cocky and handsome man in his late twenties played terrifically by Armie Hammer. The chemistry between these two young men is unlike anything you've ever seen. Chalamet proves he's one of the very best young actors around with his passionate and soul-crushing performance, promising us many incredible future roles. 'Call Me by Your Name' hits hard, allowing nearly everyone, whether gay or straight, male or female, to relate to the beauty and horrors of falling madly in love and making oneself vulnerable. James Ivory's brilliantly adapted script examines the nature of love and sex while simultaneously giving us a deeply moving coming of age tale surrounding a tortured soul. Luca Guadagnino's passionate direction proves the power of small indie films. His eye for emotion and beauty is sensational, crafting a cinematically and emotional beautiful chronicle of love and loss. Few films will make you feel and think as much as this cinematic gem.",Null,1,3,21 January 2018
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood is still an amazing filmmaker who's age can't stop him.
","Clint Eastwood is a legendary filmmaker known for directing and acting. In 'Gran Tornino' we see him do that at his finest. Clint plays Walt Kowalski , a lonely and grumpy Korean War veteran who is very prejudice towards Asian people due to his experiences. Walt is haunted by his past, has s strained relationship from his sons, has a guilty conscience, lives alone, and has a recently deceased wife. He's never had a lot of luck. When a large family of Koreans move next door to him, Walt is very unhappy at first. A disruption during one night in which the teenage son of the family, Thao, tries to steal Walt's' classic Gran Torino car causes tension and a grudge. However, when local gangs try to harm the family next door, Walt pulls out a gun and scares them off saying 'get off my lawn.' The family praises him, and Walt soon finds friendship with the family, which leads to further problems. Clint Eastwood does a fine job of directing, but his powerful performance is what really sticks out. His menacing facial expressions and grumpy, foul-mouthed attitude make his character ever so interesting. The story is also a very moving and powerful one, and is not the typical film we see every day. There's plenty of truth to it in terms of what people act like and how our lives move. The film isn't a politically correct, big statement film that makes a racial statement. It shows how redemption is a strong goal to change your life, and how judgment can prevent wonderful relationships. Every actor is superb in this film, Clint Eastwood proves old-timers can be stellar directors, and 'Gran Tornino' overall proves that lives can change even at the oldest of ages.",Null,0,2,3 July 2014
The Hurt Locker," 'The Hurt Locker' is one of cinema's best war films that shows the full-hand war experience both mentally and physically.
","War is a drug. It becomes addictive to soldiers and people to keep causing. The war experience can change one's mental states and can physically destroy you. 'The Hurt Locker' shows the full-hand war experience without an ongoing plot. Jeremy Renner plays William James, a sergeant during the Iraq war who has an incredibly dangerous job of deactivating-bombs. He works with Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge. The three men battle through the dangers of Iraq, and show what the fighting experience is like. The men encounter various enemies and experience intense scenes involving countdowns before bombs go off, mysterious men pointing cameras at the soldiers, and loud shootouts. Katherine Bigelow directs each scenes with perfection, and portrays the Iraq war in a visionary way in which we get to see how the brave men and women fought for our country, even though they never should have. Mark Boal's screenplay involves the effect of war for the soldiers in physical and mental ways. He shows how they look and feel after fighting scenes and how grueling the war experience is with the heat, patience, and energy exerted in order to survive. Boal also shows how war emotionally changes people. All three sergeants let out their feelings that can be powerful and for Jeremey Renners character, psychotic. Will James really was damaged by his experiences, and eventually becomes accustom to his work. Bigelow shows how the American soldiers in Iraq were not really fighting anybody specific. The republicans in 2003 claimed it was Al Qaeda and that there were WMD's. Then we came up with the idea that were fighting terrorists from Islamic extremist groups. But really we see how we are mostly fighting just normal criminals and people trying to protect their country. Many Islamic terrorists were fought, but mainly we see how their are no specific targets and how unorganized and out of control the war really was. Similar to how out of control each soldiers life was. Many scenes are very long sequences that are similar to the war scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan.' Very intense, heart-pounding dramatic sequences make this intelligent thriller ever so important and entertaining as any war-film you'll ever see. 'The Hurt Locker' isn't just for powerful and sad battle sequences, it has a profound message about the damage and filth that war contributes.",Null,0,2,7 July 2014
Transformers," Noisy robots doing a whole lot of nothing.
","Behold the filmmaking of Michael Bay, which consists entirely of hot women, bad actors, and noisy robots jumping all over the place. The transformer toys are a childhood favorite for many across the world, appealing mostly to young boys. Now director Michael Bay has them on the big screen in a pg-13 rated film. I give credit to Bay for allowing there to be a plot and not just a bunch of metal flying around and blowing u. Well actually that's all there is. In addition to a ridiculous concept and horrendous acting from Shia LaBeouf and the young hottie Megan Fox, Bay fills the screen with ear-piercing noises and overdone visual effects that consist entirely of making as much of a raucous as possible. Literally, I had no idea what the motivation for all this destruction was. At one point I wondered if anyone would pay attention to how mega-robots were destroying everything in sight and if anyone died in the process of this mayhem. 'Transformers' is a joke of a film, relying mostly on the stupidity of Michael Bay's direction and the shattering visuals that bombard our senses in a negative way. What we have to sit through is teenager Sam Witwicky's (LaBouef) first car actually being an alien robot. This isn't the only alien to arrive on Earth. Optimus Prime and a fellow group of transforming robots have arrived in search of the Allspark. But Optimus Prime and the Autobots aren't the only aliens to appear. Megatron and the Decepticons are also searching for the Allspark, and they would do anything to get it, even if it means destroying the world. Yep, I'm afraid this is what they're calling entertainment these days. Nothing wrong with a fun film once in a while dominated by heavy visual use and funky sounds. But Bay doesn't get it. He uses too much stupidity and unflattering cinematic techniques to deliver a money-making piece of trash with zero entertainment factors and a whole lot of heart-scratching.",Null,0,2,14 February 2015
1917," Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins craft a stunning technical achievement in 1917.
","Director Sam Mendes' '1917' is a WW I film that catches your attention, invites you into its domain, and captures you in its glory from the very beginning. There have been hundreds of war films made over the years but few have achieved such technical brilliance as this visual miracle of a movie, making it stand as the best war film since 1998's 'Saving Private Ryan.'Shot in one continuous take by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, '1917' continuously surprises us by how Deakins and Mendes were able to pull off various sequences. Shooting a film in one long-take is in itself a tremendous visual achievement but what makes this film so special is how it manages to incorporate all of the commotion going on in a chaotic war zone in just one take.Set in the title year during the first World War in the battlefields of Northern France, British soldiers Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman, who played King Tommen in 'Game of Thrones') and Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are sent on a mission deep into enemy territory to send a message to a fellow battalion to call off an attack that would unintentionally lead to the deaths of 1600 men due to German forces maneuvering a deadly trap. Both soldiers face the grueling hardships of war and fight for survival to deliver the message, Blake determined to beat time to save his older brother who happens to be in the group.Sam Mendes has crafted the most majestic and elaborate film of his career. Few filmmakers have generated such consistent tension that keeps the audience on edge due to the intensity manifested. Mendes is able to grip us solely through following our main characters along their journey, the two always in potential danger, the enemy's gunshots or bombs always in anticipation of going off. We never know when an attack will escalate or when the two men will be shot at, creating a sheer pressure for the characters that hits the audience with a punch solely on the build-up and not necessarily the actual combat.Many war films often end up being action movies, having the protagonist be unbeatable heroes who never really face any danger. Mendes depicts a realistic version of warfare, the simple inconveniences that may seem unnecessary such as a truck getting stuck in the mud, bumping into fellow soldiers while running across a battlefield, or cutting your hand on barbed wire all making the film more believable and allowing us to truly get a feel for what the characters are experiencing and how uncomfortable war can be.'1917' isn't the type of war film that will fill you with powerful emotions and doesn't necessarily excel at character development. We don't learn much about either main character, but Mendes intentionally orchestrates the film in such a manner. What the 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' director tries to pursue is to express how each soldier was simply a number and is interested in exploring how two seemingly unimportant soldiers are given great importance. While a unique approach, the film would be even more monumental if we got to know more about the two men we follow in order to identify with them, mostly in part due to the excellent performances by the two young actors we closely follow.There's no denying that '1917' is masterful mostly in part due to its stunning filmmaking. What the film lacks in narrative and characterization, it more than makes up for simply by how mesmerizing it looks on screen. The cinematography is not only extremely impressive, it will change the way movies are made. There have been films like 'Birdman' from 2014, but no film has been shot entirely in one take with so much commotion occurring. Somehow, Deakins and Mendes make a film that flows so gracefully and captures all of the details of war. Every second of the film you feel the creative strategies of a director and cinematographer, making it a truly unique cinematic experience and stunning technical achievement.Focusing the film around beating time to deliver the message allows the audience to feel a constant sense of conflict. While intense and grueling, Mendes manages to explore humanity often forgotten during the war, two sequences, in particular, standing out as beautiful and moving amid explosive carnage and kinetic intensity.With a Golden Globe win for Best Director and Best Drama Film, '1917' is a serious contender at the upcoming Academy Awards. Surely one of 2019's best films, this is a film capable of inciting elevated levels of wonder and awe due to its master-class filmmaking and showcase of true persistence.",Null,0,1,10 January 2020
Lincoln," Historical films about historical figures need more than just facts from a history book!
","There is nothing more boring than watching a historical film that seems like it was made right out of a history book. In Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' we see the story of our 16th president Abraham Lincoln, as he fought hard to pass the 13th amendment to free the slaves. The main focus of the film is Lincoln's work towards giving freedom for every individual, and not all the stuff before hand like getting elected or raising a family. The film does get in touch with Lincoln's character and doesn't just show how he was stressed out all the time. We see Lincoln's family relationships, the congressmen who fought for and against slavery during the time when Lincoln was trying to abolish slavery, and we get to see what it was like when he was assassinated. Abraham Lincoln was an amazing man, just this film is so bland. Not a single strong message was made from this film and it literally felt like Steven Spielberg and his fellow producers said 'hey! Let's make a movie about Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves!' Nothing creative was put into this film except the production design and costume design that made everything look freakishly in the 1800's. As for the acting, it's good but overdone. Daniel Day-Lewis looks identical to Lincoln, and gets the voice and walk down, but he gets bothersome and overacts and gets a little 'look at me acting.' As for Spielberg, he does a decent job of visualizing Lincoln's work but doesn't deliver his finest work. Historical pieces can be exceptional as long as they have original creativity to back it up and not make it feel like 8th grade history class all over again! Be creative!",Null,1,2,15 June 2014
Mulholland Drive," David Lynch's mind-bending mystery is an adventure of the mind.

'Mulholland Drive' is unique in that throughout the entire film the audience will be completely lost as to what the significance of several scenes are and what the film is actually trying to say, yet will be completely engaged from beginning to end. Lynch has a profound directorial style in this gem, giving us a classic noir thriller that shocks us to the bone. Naomi Watts is brilliant in a role that seems almost like a mockery, yet she controls the film with a brilliant portrayal of a lost and confused woman, her revelations being those of the audience as well.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvels most fun, creative characters.
","The success of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' reveals how comic-book fans are tired of the traditional super-heroes without flaws and prefer more round, quirky anti-heroes that take us to unique settings. James Gunn's imaginative film is a wildly fun and exciting adventure that excels not only at just having a ball and generating a stylish and explosive sci-fi hit but interesting and genuinely funny characters. The combination of misfits that is Peter Quill, Rocket the Raccoon, Groot, Gamorah, and Drax is a dynamic group of charisma and energy that is too perfect to resist. Rocket the Raccoon alone is one of my all-time favorite characters for his perfectly launched one-liners and uplifting charter arc. James Gunn does a great job having us laugh both at and with our hooligan heroes while also getting us to actually care for these strange beings due to their complexities as characters. Marvel should learn from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' due it how it fills the screen with stunningly imaginative visuals, while also balancing authentic comedy with a richly investing story.

The Imitation Game," One of the best non-fiction films ever put to the screen.
","It's a joke that Alan Turning isn't known by everyone everywhere. This is the man who cracked enigma, the Nazi communication system that was responsible for murdering multiple people during WW II. Turning was the brilliant mathematician who cracked enigma and was later imprisoned and drugged for being a homosexual. The fact that he saved millions of lives and ended a monstrous war wasn't enough for Britain to accept Alan Turing for who he was. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a brilliant performance as the man himself, Alan Turning. Imitating the fact that he is uncovering Nazi Germany's communication and uncovering himself, we see Cumberbatch bring this legendary hero to life brilliantly. Director Morten Tyldum uses elegant storytelling to bring this true story to life in a classy style of filmmamking. Most true stories are full of lousy techniques and barely bring anything else to the screen except facts. Tyldum and screenwriter Graham Moore bring us more than history, but deliver a masterful work of talent filled with powerful meaning and exquisite talent. Keira Knightley delivers her best perforce as well in her important supporting role as Turing's math partner a friend.

Clash of the Titans," Underused spectacular CGI.
","'Clash of the Titans' is one of the most anticipated films of my life. I was dazzled by the trailer involving awesome looking visuals that promised a fun theatrical experience. Little did I know director Louis Leterrier would use his ability to make a spectacular looking epic to a bare minimum. 'Clash of the Titans' is a remake of the original involving Greek mythology. Perseus (Sam Worthington), mortal son of Zeus (Liam Neeseon), battles the minions of the underworld to stop them from conquering heaven and earth in this disappointment. We all remember in the trailer seeing Liam Neeson shout 'release the Kraken' in electric energy. Honestly, some of us probably saw 'Clash of the Titans' because of that line. This story has all the potential elements of a stupid, breathtakingly amazing looking CGI fest to dazzle audiences in 3D. Where do we begin? The 3D first of all was sued after the success of 'Avatar' and has absolutely no ability to make the audience feel in the film itself b y visual means. It doesn't even have 3D potential. All the creatures seen in the trailer are all you see, and for about the same length of time. Scorpions, the Kraken, creepy bats, Madussa, and more are used minimally. They look spectacular, but are hardly used! More monster mashing please! The Kraken is especially remarkable. He's in it for about a minute. Instead of having a bunch of dazzling visuals thrown at us, we're forced to sit through some of the most pretentious, ludicrous, pathetic destiny-driven aspects that bore us to tears. With a huge budget, a studio known for producing blockbusters, and a plot that revolves around monsters and unique creatures, it sickens me that the remarkable visuals were not used enough.",Null,0,0,21 December 2014

","This film is proof that no matter how old we get we still love dinosaurs. There's nothing like giant lizards chasing stupid humans around for two hours while also fighting other dinosaurs. That's pretty much all you'll get with 'Jurassic World,' a reboot of the classic franchise that brought back these magnificent and terrifying creatures back to life. Let's start by saying that this film has one of the stupidest plots and characters in movie history. Jurassic World is a new theme park built on the original site of Jurassic Park. Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction--a genetically modified giant dinosaur called the Indominusrex--escapes containment and goes on a killing spree. Yep, stupid scientists created an ISIS dinosaur. The dinosaurs look amazing, the action and thrills are fun, and the sound is amazing. That's why you're seeing this film and that's what works for it. The stupid dialogue and ridiculous plot are all in the back of your head once these giant lizards come fighting and jumping out at you. This film is fun and entertaining from start to finish and engages you into its setting and scares the living hell out of you with magnificent dinosaurs.

The best and most successful horror films contain horror in which you never known when the next scary scene will occur. Your always hanging off the edge of your seat. If you combine this aspect with an overwhelmingly realistic setting and camera, you get 'Paranormal Activity.' In this shocking nightmare, a middle-class couple is terrorized by an unknown demon in their house. We constantly see little nuances such as the door moving, the sugar left outside containing footprints, chandeliers swinging, and more. Towards the end we get intense tension with this demon. The scariest thing about 'Paranormal Activity' is how this couple places a camera in their bedroom to get evidence of what is haunting them. It looks like a real camera the whole time, and is directed brilliantly by Oren Peli, who makes it look like a documentary. The performances by the unknown couple are also extremely realistic, making the film even more terrifying.

Black Hawk Down," A non-stop explosion of a movie. This is fantastic action.
","War movies either give you a flat-out horrifying portrayal of the hardships faced when killing to resolve a political crisis, or they sugar coat it to make it less realistic and hard to watch. Wimps. Ridley Scott thankfully gives us a masterpiece of modern day warfare, reflecting how every soldier's contribution to war is impactful, and how the bonds of brotherhood are at risk in battle. Scott directs a true story from 1993, where 123 elite U.S. soldiers fly into Somalia to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord. What they find is themselves caught in a battle with a large force of heavily-armed Somalis armed to the teeth after one of their helicopters is shot down. Yikes. Time for plan B of the mission. This true story is filmed to perfection. Edited perfectly with all shots and camera angles adding up perfectly to deliver realistic gun shots and explosions, you'll be brought right into the battle that took place years ago. The intensity Scott and his team deliver is mind-blowing and dangerously hardcore. With over two hours of a non-stop battle, you'll be hooked and at the edge of your seat the entire time. What's really interesting about 'Black Hawk Down' is that it always stays true to history, never trying to be something it's not. Ridley Scott never gets carried away with Ken Nolan's powerful and action-packed script, keeping it's written roots true by simply portraying what a hardcore modern day war scene looks like. Scott takes us into the battle. He doesn't just have us watch it. With gorgeous cinematography and outstanding editing, 'Black Hawk Down' provides hours of realistic war violence that help us gain a better appreciation of the difficulties of foreign diplomacy, and what can go wrong when a plan crumbles. Plan B was never so dangerous.",Null,1,1,23 May 2015
Prisoners," 'Prisoners' is an unpredictable thriller with strong themes and characters.
","There are many films about missing children. Most are predictable within the first fifteen minutes, but 'Prisoners' directed by Denis Villeneuve is a grossly entertaining film that always keeps you guessing. Hugh Jackman stars as a small town father of two named Keller Dover. When his six-year old daughter is mysteriously gone missing on a cloudy thanksgiving, he hires Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to investigate the crime and find his daughter. Hugh Jackman and his wife (Mari Bello) have a couple they are friends with who's daughter is kidnapped at the same time. As the investigation unfolds we see deep character change. Both Dover and Loki get wrapped up in anger, fear, revenge and stress as they try and uncover the truth. Hugh Jackman gives a powerful performance and plays the small town father perfectly. His character is so realistic and isn't forced for a second. Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome as a detective, and is an interesting aspect of the story. The script by Aaron Guzokowski is full of detail and brilliant symbolism as well as character development and suspense. The dark cinematography adds an accurate feeling to the story as you get lost up in the dark tone of the film. While watching 'Prisoners' you get to think about what you as a parent would do in situations that people like Hugh Jakcman's character face. The film provides strong messages such as getting caught up in anger and haste, forgiveness, detail, and trust.

","Martin Scorsese has never really handled religion in his films despite it being a pivotal aspect of his life. In 'Silence' the master filmmaker crafts a nearly three hour time-piece epic that is difficult to sit through because of its slow pace and boring nature. Despite this, Scorsese gets his question across- how far can we go to keep and practice our faith? As an atheist, I found this film very interesting and mentally rewarding. Scorsese gives you a lot to think about even if not making the film as powerful or emotional as I was hoping. Andrew Garfield gives a terrific performance that Scorsese guides beautifully.

The Dark Knight," 'The Dark Knight' is a dark superhero epic with all the elements of a great blockbuster.
","Superhero films generally deal with pointless action sequences, a typical plot and typical characters. Christopher Nolan stepped in and thought about changing that. The result: one of the greatest blockbusters of all time with social themes, dark characters, and entertaining action. The Dark Knight is a Batman film in which crime is ruling Gotham City, and police chief commissioner Gordon is teaming up with batman and district attorney Harvey Dent who is dating Bruce Wayne's former girlfriend Rachel. As Batman and the government of Gotham City try to overthrown the criminals, the joker and his men now plant terrorism on Gotham City as if things couldn't get worse. The Joker uses many methods and tricks to raise hell in Gotham before justice can be assured. Christopher Nolan directs this powerhouse blockbuster with the ultimate amount of technology and visual appeal to make this a classic. Every visual film element is superb. The rich sound and visual effects make the action sequences realistic and thrilling enough to make one of the best cinematic viewing experiences of all time. What's really interesting is that Christopher Nolan makes 'The Dark Knight' more of a crime sequel than another superhero film. As stated earlier, you have the criteria of a complex crime with that deals with themes relating to society as opposed to worthless Hollywood recycled material. The Dark Knight has everything to make a suspenseful and shocking action film. The strongest aspect 'The Dark Knight' has is its villain, the joker. Heath Ledger's tragic death was after he gave the world the greatest performance by a villain in motion picture history, and one of the greatest acting performances period. His darkness, look, and attitude is so unpredictable and shocking that you want him on each scene. The other performances by Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, and Gary Oldman as Gordon are decent, but Heath Ledger adds so much chemistry to make this film complete.

Based on a remarkable true story, Sean Penn captures the heart and soul of the physical and emotional wilderness inside and around man. This film could have been done poorly is just any director tackled the project, but Penn gives the film a gorgeous layer of emption that makes the audience dig deep into the true story he's documenting. Eddie Veder's original songs written and performed for the film are superb and capture the nature of the film perfectly.

2001: A Space Odyssey," The single most boring film of all time!
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' has been acclaimed as one of the greatest films of all time that is nothing short of a cinematic miracle. How? This film lacks any surreal visual literature and has absolutely nothing to show for besides a cutting-edge visual portrayal including groundbreaking cinematography, clear sound and stylish visual effects. The visual evolution in film is interesting to study and when considering that in 1968 this was considered a visual miracle, you'll feel very granted to live in a time where visual effects are mostly eye-popping all the time. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is about three different space stories about evolution within animals, mankind and technology. When the world is ruled by apes, one particular group discovers a mysterious rectangular monolith near their home, which imparts upon them the knowledge of tool use, and enables them to evolve into people. A similar monolith is discovered on the moon, and it is determined to have come from an area near Jupiter. Astronaut Dave Bowman, along with four companions, sets off for Jupiter on a spaceship controlled by HAL 9000, a revolutionary computer system that is every bit humankind's equal--and perhaps its superior. When HAL endangers the crew's lives for the sake of the mission, Bowman will have to first overcome the computer, then travel to the birthplace of the monolith. This story isn't handled well. It's all over the place. First we see apes evolving, next we get this space mission with absolutely no character development, hardly any dialogue, a lame plot who's only support is visual effects. Not one scene is gripping or directed well by Stanley Kubrick, who makes the film extremely quiet causing the film to sooth you into a deep sleep. The extremely long length and boring plot with scenes that are never started or ended at the right time caused me to count down the entire time of how many minutes were left until I could be free from this snoozer. The film doesn't tackle any themes of persistence, teamwork or risk like many space films do. Instead, it's all plain visuals. We see the visual portrayal of a space mission instead of the depth taken by mankind. The fact that this is being praised as one of the greatest films of all time shocks me greatly. This just simply cannot compete with other classic films that are handled in a better subject and don't make you tired and bored to tears.",Null,7,14,7 August 2014
Blood Diamond," 'Blood Diamond' is an important action film that has everything you need in cinema!
","The diamond trade in Africa is one of the most depressing and saddening struggles the modern world is experiencing. People are killed over diamonds and are put into dangerous working conditions that have extreme punishments for the manufactures. Realistic fiction is a powerful way to bring up this current issue, and Edward Zwick directs 'Blood Diamond' in perfection with a strong cast and roller-coaster of a plot. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as a Rhodesian diamond smuggler named Danny Archer who works for a corrupt diamond company in London. While vising in Sierra Leone in order to confiscate diamonds, he comes in contact with Solomon Vandy, a fisherman played powerfully by Djimon Houson who lost his son by rebels who turn him into a child soldier. However, Vandy was able to find a huge pink diamond that he buried for safety. Archer makes him a deal to find his son if he gets the diamond. The two men team up with a beautiful journalist played by Jennifer Connelly who works to get a story about diamond smuggling. All three characters are deeply moved by their experiences. This film covers so many boundaries and is filmed in a kinetic and powerful way. Edward Zwick gets mind-blowing footage of Sierra Leone and focuses on the sorrow and the beauty of the dangerous lands. He captures spectacular wildlife and culture as well as extreme violence that will leave you speechless. Some scenes in Blood Diamond are very hard to watch, while others are used for exciting entertainment that is balanced excellently. The editing is very strong that has excellent sound and visual effects, but also gets footage evenly and lengths each scene to help organize the heavy plot. Every actor is spectacular. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a flawless performance who shows a two-sided man that you will love and hate throughout the compelling story. Djimon Houson is excellent and is a very likable man that will make you feel for him in scenes where he looses his emotions. 'Blood Diamond' takes on a saddening issue that needs attention. This film has a perfect ending but is a dream of what the ending results will be. With excellent entertainment, film making and impeccable character development, 'Blood Diamond' stirs up the attention the dark continent needs in order to assure peace and will give the audience a powerful and perfectly constructed work of cinematic nature.",Null,0,0,10 July 2014
Men in Black," 'Men in Black' is a fun and original take on the alien genre.
","We're so familiar with aliens terrifying the bejeesus out of us in films that it's refreshing to see a well-known classic spoof the genre. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work miracles together playing detective-like heroes assigned to take down and destroy aliens. Jones is hilarious. Usually playing serious men, Jones is so funny and doesn't take himself too seriously. Bruce Willis has nothing on him. Will Smith is a little out of control and that't the reason his performance works. He's a funny dude who isn't fit for saving the world. Jay and Kay bond perfectly together breathing energy to this fun film as well as an ounce or two of heart. Seeing Smith and Jones wear sunglasses and fancy suits while holding giant space guns is a cinematic sight no one can forget. With visual effects pretty spellbound for the time, 'Men in Black' is fun and entertaining throughout. It can't compare to some of the other films mostly relying on unique creatures to draw us in, but it's such an original story that has a witty script by Ed Solomon and well-handled directing by Barry Sonnenfeld who not only knows how to blend comedy and intense action, but can make you truly care about the men in black shooting up giant cockroach aliens and working like charmers. 'Men in Black' does get a little odd at times, not staying true to its premise and taking some plot turns that I wasn't particularly fond of. However, this film stays fun throughout and should be seen to experience 90's blockbuster action.",Null,7,9,29 November 2014
Midsommar," Ari Aster's Midsommar is the single most terrorizing and suturing film of all time.
","Every summer in Scandinavia, Europeans celebrate the summer solstice with an array of festive activities, such as traditional dancing, gourmet cooking, and lots and lots of drinking. Extravagant clothes are worn, music is played, and sometimes pagan rituals are practiced during the longest day of the year, where sunlight is constant and the celebrations are continuous for weeks.This ongoing festival known as Midsummer is still an incredibly popular occurrence throughout all of northern Europe, countries such as Sweden celebrating it as their national holiday. This seemingly harmless party was once practiced back before the origination of Christianity, in which brutal acts of human sacrifice and ritualistic violence occurred in order to worship either mother nature or various gods, including Jesus Christ at certain points in human history.After last year's horror knockout Hereditary, director Ari Aster has topped his disturbing first feature by centering the Midsummer festivals as the topic of his latest horror nightmare Midsommar. This is a film I had been looking forward to seeing tremendously due to how Hereditary shook me to my core and kept me enthralled from start to finish and ended up disturbing me more than any other film, which I mean in the best way possible. Now, with Midsomar Ari Aster has crafted yet another ingenious horror film, this time delivering another brilliant piece of cinema but being too disturbing in his imagery at times.Let me be frank by stating that Midsommar is the single most atrociously disturbing film I have ever seen, both due to what is and isn't shown on screen. Aster is too liberal in what he shows on the screen, depicting the most gruesome act of violence shown on film that I (and probably anyone) has ever witnessed. While there are only two scenes that actually depict ritualistic violence, Midsommar grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go, overwhelming your senses with a constant shred of dread, yet acting like a car accident that you know will haunt you, yet you can't turn away from.
The film follows Dani, a young woman plagued by an unspeakable family tragedy who travels to Sweden with her selfish boyfriend and his fellow anthropology graduate student friends in order to study the traditional festival in one of their friends' rural communes. Dani and Christian have a failing relationship yet she attends the festival anyway in order to escape from her harsh reality, thinking a peaceful few weeks in the beautiful Swedish countryside will help her move away from her trauma. Turns out, Dani couldn't have been more wrong. She and her American travel companions soon realize that the commune practices ancient traditions in tribute to the circle of life, their culture one of barbaric savagery and evil.What keeps Midsommar together is actress Florence Pugh's remarkably fierce performance as Dani. Pugh gives her character a defensive charisma that she tries to use as protection against her vulnerabilities, yet the actress is simultaneously able to expose Dani's fears and vulnerabilities. Pugh does a perfect job of expressing raw emotion and is able to act genuinely horrified by what her character is going through, a rare talent found in very few actors in horror films.It's important to note that this is not a film for mainstream audiences and is definitely not for everyone. If not immediately turned off from the scene I referred to earlier in which we see an atrociously graphic and grisly suicide (two people walked out of the theatre when this occurred), many will be put off by the fragile and delicate pace that Aster composes. Aster wants us to feel comfortable before taking advantage of us as a director. Having his film take place almost entirely in bright daylight while surrounded by beautiful scenery and slowly unfolding the terror allows the filmmaker to manipulate us as an audience and secure a false sense of comfort before overwhelming us in terrorizing bodily horror.However, Aster uses his pacing to his advantage and makes the film far more effective. By taking the time to get to know Dani, we root and feel for her as a protagonist and are generally concerned for her safety and emotional state. Aster creates a vibe as a director that is intoxicating. We are constantly feeling a sense of uneasiness and are desperately awaiting what is next to come out of fear of being further disturbed. Using artistic editing and stunning cinematography to its advantage, the film presents a visually captivating array of images that wake the purest of emotions in us. I literally felt numb during several moments of this film due to how disturbed and unnerved I was at not only some of the hauntingly realistic and graphic images displayed on the screen but by the constant sense of fearing the unknown of what is yet to come.It's easy to say that Ari Aster is one of the most effective directors of our time. He's a filmmaker who wants his audience engaged with his work in each and every second, using storytelling techniques such as foreshadowing and connectives in the most profound and creative fashions. Few filmmakers who contribute to the horror genre are able to make their films feel so real, which is why Aster is a natural master of horror. We're terrified and disturbed by his films because they feel like realistic plots, as opposed to obvious fictional situations that, while entertaining, don't resonate and hit home as hard.I can't say that I can recommend this film due to how hardcore it is and how viciously disturbing it is. While Midsommar was by far one of the most memorable movie-going experiences of my life, most will be mortified by what they see. While I am haunted by some of what I saw in this film, I'm glad I saw it. It's a film that got not only an enormous reaction out of me but kept me more entertained than almost any film I've ever seen. Despite including the most hideously violent scene and the most uncomfortable and warped sex scene in film history, Midsommar is a truly unforgettable experience that will haunt you for weeks. While I felt these two scenes could have been much tamer and less barbaric and strange, Midsommar is even more mortifying than I expected, a description that, while normally would sound like a criticism, is the highest praise a psychological horror film could get.Midsommar is by all means a messed up and hard to watch film, but it's because of this that it's so captivating and hunting. Simply put, this is one of the most unforgettable films of the 21st century, one I doubt I can handle seeing again, but unforgettable in the purest of senses.",Null,16,34,6 July 2019
The Graduate," 'The Graduate' is one of few films that deserves to be called a classic.
","The young people of our world have always been bad at decision making in general. They're still new to the world and cannot make tough decisions due to their little experience in existence. Having an affair with an older married woman in her early thirties of late forties while you'r in college may not be such a great idea. It may also be tough if you form an alliance with the woman's husband and fall in love with her daughter simultaneously. This action is due to not knowing about the perks of being an adult. Dustin Hoffman gives his only A-game performance in Mike Nichols classic 'The Graduate', where he plays a recent college graduate named Ben, unsure of his future. His affair with the provocative Mrs Robinson (Anne Brancoft) may be a big mistake for young Ben. Mike Nichols film is all about the struggles of immaturity. Ben is a bright young man that cannot explain his actions. Sure, Buck Henry and Calder Willingham add natural humor that at times get's uncomfortable, but this film is more a depressed coming of age story than a comedy like many approach it to be. Our climax we drop our jaws at is a classic Hollywood set of screen-time that helps shape an unexpected resolution, but nothing gets resolved technically. That's what so cutting-edge about Nichols' film, it isn't your typical Hollywood story like most were use to at the time. Nichols directs 'The Graduate in an up-beat rhythm that not only reflects the time period, but shows the world crumbling down on Ben. The actors give top-notch performances who work with rich material. Classic films are somewhat overrated in my opinion. Not 'The Graduate.' It's an original masterpiece that flows well with an appropriate score and an ingenious theme. See it at some point to be immersed in it's distinctive personality.",Null,0,0,2 November 2014
Elysium," Futuristic with creativity.
","Neil Blomkamp made a great directorial debut with 'District 9', one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. This time he teams up with Academy Award winner Matt Damon for 'Elysium', a futuristic film that reflect the wealth gap in nations in the entire world. Matt Damon plays Max, a man who lives on earth in 2154. Earth is in horrible condition due to overpopulation, war, disease etc. Since its sci-fi there's a space ship. It's called Elysium and is prettier than Disney World. Here a corrupt Jodie Foster in an ill-cast role is in charge of the ship and kills anyone from Earth who attempts to join her in space. Max eventually has to go to Elysium in order to safe himself and Earth. I wouldn't spoil why he has to go up. This is a total popcorn film that isn't pure stupidity and explosions. It has a really interesting theme of immigration and how wealth in shared unequally in many nations, just how District 9 had a message about apartheid in South Africa. The visual effects are very well-done as well and provide excellent entertainment. A good futuristic film is always fun, and its even better when there's robots, explosives, cool guns, and strong themes to back it up so it isn't complete trash.",Null,0,0,5 June 2014
Taken," Liam Neeson has a set of skills...
","Since Hollywood can't just keep an exhilarating action-thriller by it's self and has to make two sequels (one exactly the same, and the other not even apart of the continuous story) to create a franchise, it can be hard to enjoy the first 'Taken' film that was awesome. Liam Neeson being known as an old bad-ass may be a head-shaker for some, but I dig every bit of his pathetic tough-guy dialogue and equipped fight skills. 'Taken' being his most bad-ass role involves him killing over forty evil sex-traffickers who kidnap his daughter in Paris. Sex- traffickers were the perfect villains to tackle due to having an international relations type of plot with Neeson's character traveling all over. Fight after fight and shot after shot, Neeson delivers menacing facial expressions towards his enemies while constantly knocking down bad guys in his post CIA career. Director Pierre Morel gets the fact that Americans like big movie stars taking down bad guys without making us suffer through some father-daughter sap. Morel blends a mega human rights issue that's handled with awesome action, punishing those cruel men who fill his screen. Neeson, having a blast, gives a ton of energy into his fun role. Only taking up 93 minutes, 'Taken' is a smart thriller with package after package of action that's delivered in the finest form imaginable.",Null,0,0,20 March 2015
Alice in Wonderland," 'Alice in Wonderland' is a visually stunning remake.
","Hollywood loves to create remakes of classic films from years ago. They hired Tim Burton to do 'Alice in Wonderland', a remake from the animated classic of 1951. This time he makes it live action and stylish by adding some darkness and absolutely artistic production design and other visual elements. The story is the same. A young woman named Alice (Mia Wasinkowska) denies dancing with a noble Englishman at a party, so runs off to find herself trapped in a magical world after falling down a large hole by a tree. In this Wonderland she meets many mysterious creatures such as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), Alice guide through Wonderland, two odd twins named Tweedledee and Tweedledum, an evil and a good queen, a smoking caterpillar, an energetic rabbit and a unique Cheshire cat. here Alice learns her true destiny is to free Wonderland from the evil Red Queen (Helan Bonham Carter) and become a hero. This plot is lead with an all-star cast and a creative director which gives this film suave. It could have been very easy to make this film one giant mess, but thankfully Tim Burton was hired to save this remake and turn it into visual art. The character development is a little weak, but that doesn't matter due to the plot being kinetic and always full of matter and tension. There is always something going on. The visual effects are very cutting-edge. They may not be as realistic looking as 'The Lord of the Rings' or as explosive as other films, but there not suppose to. They look magical and new. The action scenes, the mist, the movements all look so new and extraordinary that it's impossible to take your eye off them. What's even more hard to take your eyes off is the production design. Wonderland is brought to life from Robert Stromberg in an unimaginable way. The sets, vegetation, costumes and makeup all fit the environment beautifully. The casting is perfect as well. Every actor plays each character perfectly and makes each once animated voice over come to life with so much depth and detail. 'Alice in Wonderland' may not be an overall amazing film as it fails in some writing and editing, but it's visually miraculous and just plane old fun at the cinema.",Null,0,1,24 August 2014
Avatar," 'Avatar' is the greatest science fiction film of all time that contains beautiful and magnificent visual elements.
","Sci-fi is an interesting genre that is strongest in the visual category. James Cameron has been one of the strongest in making these films. Now he creates the single greatest sci-fi film ever put in cinemas called 'Avatar.' This film is about a handicapped marine named Jake who works with the marines to extract scientific data and elements that can help Earth refuel its natural resources after a mass amount of pollution caused earth to loose its natural world, deeply affecting humans. The marines target the planet of Pandora, a lush and unique planet filled with beautiful topography and magnificent and beautiful creatures such as dragons, predators called 'thanators',rhino-like creatures called hammerhead 'titanotheres', and much more. The marines scientifically activate the marines to explore the planet if Pandora so they can avoid the toxic gases breathed by humans, and genetically modify them to become Avatars, tall blue creatures that are pure originality. Jake soon meets the native people called the Na'vi, and forms a love interest with one of the females. Soon the battle for Pandora arises when the marines try and destroy the land. Jake must choose between the two sides in order to survive. James Cameron's directing is superb and breathtaking. Every shot is beautiful and well-done. The visual elements are extremely strong, and perhaps have never been so diverse and amazing in the history of film. The production design of Pandora is so creative and beautiful and is clearly shown that it took some time to create. The effects such as explosions and sound and editing are magnificent and are crafted beautifully in order to be put together to make a complete film.

The Artist," Return to the silent era in this Oscar-winning triumph.
","It takes a lot of guts to make a silent movie in this time in history. Audiences, especially in America, want to be entertained instead of seeing something artistic. 'The Artist' returns a few decades back to where movies were silent, no dialogue and hardly any sound besides music. French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius does something truly unique in this film, telling the story of a silent movie star who meets a young dancer, but the arrival of talking pictures sends their careers in opposite directions. Embracing the historical aspects of filmmaking and using it as a metaphor for his aging lifestyle and change in life works beautifully to incorporate both cinematic art techniques and character development. The French George Clooney Jean Dujardin gives a tremendous and equipped performance as actor George Valentin, not saying a word and yet revealing the most important and daring parts of his complicated and stylish character. Every actor does great work in a type of film that hasn't been done for decades. Each actor shows how much time he or she put in to mastering the silent film character.

'La La Land' follows a jazz artist (Ryan Gosling) and an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) who fall in love ion Los Angeles and try and break out into their career paths. This film's a musical.

A Clockwork Orange," 'I was cured, all right.'
","Stanley Kubrick's bizarre, stylish, disturbing, crazy, confusing classic is still a controversy and a film that few truly understand. Kubrick does a great job directing this film, yet doesn't explain it well enough. We clearly see the work of a director in each scene, Kubrick's style and artistic vision evident from start to finish. Yet I feel he struggles in creating a vision that lets his audience actually understand what point he wants to get across. Malcolm McDowell gives a complex, layered performance as Alex the psychopath who enters grueling psychiatric care in order to be cured of his evil and transformed into a productive member of society. McDowell is electric, terrifying one minute, then sweet and reserved the next. It takes a truly gifted actor for us to hate his guts one moment, then empathize with him the next. Stanley Kubrick has good intentions in adapting this creative and visionary tale, yet could have done things differently to have it come across more clearly. He ends the film perfectly, an ending I would argue is one of the most satisfying and unique endings in film history. If Kubrick kept a more clear and less distracting vision from start to finish, we'd have an absolute masterpiece, not a confusing pulp film that leaves more questions than answers.",Null,0,0,30 December 2018

","Adventure. Fantasy. Imagination. Too bad 'National Treasure,' a film with Hollywood scum written all over it, decides to fool audiences in a making a ridiculous action film with perhaps a blend of all the terms I started off with in my review. Whats wrong wit those three words you might ask? Absolutely nothing. The trouble arises when you have an untalented director throwing every action movie cliché at you that you can see from China. Nicholas Cage stars as (for many, the four previous words outside of parentheses might have already scared you from seeing the film) Benjamin Franklin Gates. Despite one of the stupidest movie character names in history, Gates descends from a family of treasure-seekers who've all hunted for the same thing: a war chest hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. Ben's close to discovering its whereabouts, as is his competition, but the FBI is also hip to the hunt. The conflict in this film is so unexplored and uneventful that I felt bored throughout. We never end up knowing anything important about the key elements the multiple writers may or may not have intended us to know. And yes, we have to sit through numerous history lessons about this sought after piece of treasure. This story is like something you'd find at a library full of appreciated stories for pre-teens. Jon Turteltaub (speaking of stupid names) directs the film with an glittering sign of stupidity. Instead of allowing this ridiculous story to be fun, he makes every actor pitch their brainless dialogue in scenes revolving around soap-opera like scenarios. At times, I forgot what the plot was about due to the dull chemistry between this poor cast. To see Boromir from 'The Lord of the Rings' play the bad guy is very disappointing. Cage, on the other hand, rallies up another title on his list of 'the worst movies of all time that happened to be staring me.'",Null,0,1,11 December 2014
Reservoir Dogs," The birth of Quentin Tarantino's cinema: The film that proved his brilliance and originality!
","Quentin Tarantino is a man of original cinema. At the 1992 Sundance Film Festival, the world was vulnerable to his cinematic talent and triggered a legacy of classic films. 'Reservoir Dogs' is Tarantino's first feature film. Eight gangster's plan a huge heist that goes terribly wrong in which the cops start chasing them down, trust is broken between the eight men, and violence erupts like a volcano. All eight men keep their personal lives private, and it's so private that they have fake names. Each one is a color! Mr.White is Harvey Keitel, a short-tempered but conscience thief. Mr.Pink is Steve Buscemi, a whinny and cynical sneaky crook who has great dialog and is teased by the other men due to his 'gay' name. Mr. Orange is an undercover cop working in on the men to take them down. He is very shy young man at first, but soon forms a relationship with Mr.White who guides and looks out for him. Orangey is played by Tim Roth. The last main character is Mr.Blonde, a cold-hearted and violent man who has absolutely no conscience and is absolutely terrifying. Michael Madsen delivers a chilling performance as this killer. The other four men are very minor characters, which is good so that you don't have too much character development to drag out the story. The way Trantino writes out the story is perfect. The story is all about the events that take place after the crime instead of leading up to the crime and during the crime like most stories would go. This film shows the long, realistic results that erupt as a result of crime. Each main character is given a tremendously entertaining background before they started working for their old-school boss Joe. Tarantino gives great character development and classic QT dialog that leads into hilarious conversations. After funny sequences, you'll have shocking gun-violence and chilling tension that gives a realistic nature to life. Not all crime films have to be serious serious serious, instead they contain realistic people who outside of their crime are just goofy guys! Quentin Tarantino directs great sequences from the opening diner scene, to the cool slow-motion walking scene, to the intense shootings. You'll enjoy his skillful directing. 'Reservoir Dogs' is a cult-classic that is a uniquely put together crime film that never gets old.

How to Train Your Dragon," Crowd-pleasing animation that doesn't pull off the kind of sentimentalism of other animated hits.
","It was a matter of time before an animated film centered around fire-breathing dragons. What's to blame? Everybody loves dragons! Sadly, Dreamworks animation fails to create any source of beautiful animation and keeps giving off cheap laughs to entertain kids and families. A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed. Oh boy, never heard of that one before. The recycled elements of family-encoded fun feel tired and unoriginal in 'How to Train Your Dragon.' The dragons are well-done for animation, but the rest of the film looks very awkward and has no ounce of creativity. Pixar and other forms of heartfelt animation have got everything on Dreamworks. The feel-good quality is moving if your a parent or under-appreciated child, but for the most part you'll be able to see all the humor and plot twists coming in every direction. Why be hard on an animated kids film? Because this genre has created some of the greatest films to date. In recent years, 'Up,' 'Fantastic Mr.Fox,' 'Finding Nemo,' and the 'Toy Story' films have not only made audiences laugh and cry, but has the ability to consume the finds and have the stories stick with you forever. A big budget, popular voices including Gerard Butler, and a gigantic studio behind it, 'How to Train Your Dragon' has no excuse for cheap animation. There's just nothing interesting or visually mesmerizing about this. Hell, the 3D looks like it was used just for one scene to try and compete with 'Avatar.'

While it could have picked it up a little during the middle, Emily BLunt and Benicio Del Toro give remarkable performances that help glue the pictures to the project. They're utterly fantastic in every scenes they take up. What this film does well is focus on more than its central theme, something most crime films that are good follow.

Chris Pratt is also fun and confident as a Marvel protagonist, once again shaping the traditional identity of a superhero in a new fashion. Volume 2 is just as stunning and fun as its predecessor, and after this sequel, I can honestly say I cannot wait to see what Volume 3 has to offer and what the future is for these wildly enjoyable characters.",Null,0,0,20 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A strong start to one of the most iconic stories in history.
","Lord Voldemort, Hogwarts, magic wands, Dumbledore, trolls, Hermione, Gringots, more trolls, magic, centors, Hagrid...? The creativity from author J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' franchise is nothing short of miraculous. Rowling has added another chapter to the list of fantasy classics with her artistic style of writing and rags to riches story of success. Now of course her story enters the cinema. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is the first of seven Harry Potter stories, and a strong set up for this long, magical, and complex story of heroism and imagination. Director Chris Columbus brings us into the thoughts of J.K. Rowling's brilliant mind and shows us a world like no other. His biggest issue is that he makes it too childish. Adding some more sophistication and depth to this magical story is a big chunk missing. But enough of that. The first increment of this marvelous legacy comes to play in a fantastic and adventurous style that all will love. Starting out, rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny (Harry) proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry while meeting Ron and Hermione and tackling down the evil Lord Voldemort. If you don't know who any of those characters are, you really need to start paying attention. Seeing these now millionaire actors start off as little kids is also a joyous experiment. With all the magic and fantasy plopping your way, you won't help but smile at the insight and brilliance of this fantastic world invented for pages, but meant for the screen that has brought passion to the lives of millions.",Null,0,0,25 April 2015
The Happening," The title refers to M.Night Shyamalan's failing career.
","There was a time where a great filmmaker by the name of M.Night Shyamalan was creating films such as 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs.' I wonder why this once gifted brilliant artist turned to making awful apocalyptic films that made good actors give horrible performances. 'The Happening' can be thought of as more than just the title of a bad movie, but what is happening to the talent of Mr. Shyamalan. 'The happening' is also about a disease or natural defect in which people space out and kill themselves. It's occurring in Central Park, where high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Alma (Zoey Deschanel) must fight to survive and escape from the terror. The whole idea of a disorder in which you go crazy and kill yourself is something hat SNL would do a spoof on as one of their prime skits. To make a serious drama about it, and have leading actors try and deliver strong performances turns it into something pretty silly. Mark Wahlberg gives his worst job of acting, and is even a better wrapper than an actor here. He talks so stupidly, and it is hard to take him seriously in such a crazy subject matter. Deschanel out acts him. She's god awful as well. The directing by Shyamalan is over dramatic and tries to be suspenseful when really there's nothing to shock you. His writing is worse. The characters he writes are used as a way to make the story feel as if it is effective, but really we have seen similar stories in films way less audacious and pointless. I miss the old days when M.Night Shyamalan was behind the camera and writing mind adventures instead of laughable disaster movies with no suspense and terrible directing.",Null,1,2,12 October 2014
The Shape of Water," Guillermo Del Toro creates one of the most cinematically beautiful epics of our time.
","Water gives life. Guillermo Del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is all about love and life. Few filmmakers create films where you sense the work of a director in every shot, and Del Toro does exactly that. Through his brilliance and creativity, Guillermo Del Toro places himself as one of the best filmmakers of our time with this masterpiece. Set during the Cold War, the mutant janitor of a research facility named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love with a test subject, which happens to be an amphibian-like creature similar in many ways to a man. With help from her friend Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer), Elisa risks everything to try and save the creature from the wicked government agents trying abusing him, specifically Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Del Toro's unusual love story is simply beautiful. We get many gorgeous shots of water in many forms, symbolizing the different forms of love found throughout life. Del Toro isn't emphasizing that people-creature relationships should be socially accepted, but rather uses their relationship as a mechanism to convey the multiple complexities and layers of love and life. Del Toro crafts a truly beautiful film dedicated to the art of cinema, shining in his details and poetic signatures. Each performance is remarkable, notably the wickedness of the great Michael Shannon and the richness of Sally Hawkins mute but brilliant performance. 'The Shape of Water' is not only visually beautiful due to its breathtaking cinematography, but conveys a beautiful test on life and love and how love itself takes many different shapes.",Null,22,40,19 December 2017
The Departed," Martin Scorsese's best picture since 'Goodfellas' is a spell-bounding crime classic with every film element imaginable at its peak.
","Crime has been a powerhouse genre for film for decades. These stories have intense plots and interesting characters that make us see the world of crime in shockingly new ways. Director Martin Scorsese is the king of making crime films that are not only good but influential and classic. In his film 'The Departed' we have an intense story with genius characters and superb acting. Leonardo Dicaprio gives his best performance as Billy Costigan, a low-life Boston citizen who plans on finding a job in the police force. When he gets a job from the Boston State Police as an undercover investigator to take down brutal mobster Frank Costello (a brilliant Jack Nicholson) and get his works pay. Big shot Massachusetts state police detective Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is working on taking Costello down the old fashion way, but is secretly working with him and is a rat in the police force. As the gravity of the crime increases and secrets and lies are revealed, you'll get Martin Scorsese crime like you have never seen before and it will leave you shocked and speechless. Scorsese deals with the themes of power, corruption of authority and lying more than ever in this picture. He has interesting characters that are both similar and different to each other at the same time. Each actor, especially Leonardo Dicaprio give strong performances that are believable and not forced like in most crime films at all. William Monahan's screenplay is a reflection on the criminal system in America, and how crime is in everyone in relation to the law and in relation to crime cases in general. He portrays how big messages or clues can be right under our nose and how unpredictable the world of crime is. The film editing is superbly superior, adding intense violence and great directorial shots to complete this masterpiece. Not a single thing is wrong with this new crime classic, and Martin Scorsese adds on his legacy to crime films in cinema, adding different and similar aspects to his original style of film making to make this pure cinematic beauty entertaining and eye-opening at the same time.",Null,1,3,24 June 2014
The Witch," A thoughtful and subtle horror film.
","Puritanism and witchcraft is a topic that I have found haunting for years. Maybe it's the ancient time period and troubling subject matter that makes it so terrifying, or perhaps its relationship with Satanism. Robert Eggers' 'The Witch' isn't the kind of horror film that necessarily scares you while viewing the film, but haunts you and sticks in your kind. It's a subtle bunch of scares that doesn't have pop-ups and gore, but a subject matter that's deeply unnerving. The family haunted by a witch in ancient New England is cast perfectly, each actor giving brilliant performances. This is a truly fresh independent horror film with more thought and cinematic vision than almost any horror film ever made. What makes 'The Witch' so special is that it focuses on people, not a plot. It uses the family as a way of showing the oppressive nature of ancient Christianity and how religion and witchcraft causes people to change. It's the humanity of the film that scares you. And make the creepy goat has something to do with it. 'The Witch' is truly terrifying and beautifully made. Thesoul-piercing score and a shocking ending are what stick in my mind the most, and I can only hope Robert Eggers sticks with the horror genre in the future.",Null,1,2,25 February 2018
The Holiday," Surprisingly, this is a smart and heartfelt romantic comedy that's entertaining throughout.
","Fearing the dreadfulness of bitter-stupid sappiness and troubled women who are impossible to care about, we finally get a romantic comedy that appears as one of those types of films, but delivers natural comedy and has some heartfelt touches to it. 'The Holiday' scared off viewers because of its ingredients: two unhappy woman due to their relationship problems swipe houses to cope with their failures. Cameron Diaz plays a rich L.A. woman who enters partially- rural London where Kate Winslet can't win the guy she loves. Winslet enters the big city of L.A., and guess what! Both women fall in love with a guy. Jude Law and Jack Black are perfect supporting males to operate on non-stereotypical relationships that cause us to root for a good outcome. Nancy Meyers constantly throws sweet laughs at you without having to be raunchy or ridiculous. There are hardly any moments in 'The Holiday' that feel recycled or redundant. Each time we get a new situation, it's gentle and sweet and not pathetically audacious like most romantic comedies get. The wit behind Meyers' writing calls for big laughs and a big heart. The entire cast is terrific and have fun with their roles, playing four entirely different people who all share one thing in common: a desire for love and human connection. It just goes to show that people all over the world suffer from love related issues. No matter how much we deny it, we all crave love is what Meyers proves. By placing just enough sappiness to remind us we're still watching a romantic comedy, 'The Holiday' is an uplifting treat for all.",Null,0,1,7 January 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," 'Zero Dark Thirty' is non-fiction like you've never seen!
","When Osama Bin Laden was killed many people reacted with joy. That's the way I reacted after viewing this film. 'Zero Dark Thirty' takes you behind the real-life mission of the manhunt for Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, the man responsible for the tragic 9/11 attacks. Jessica Chastain plays Maya, a desk warrior who's life mission was finding Bin Laden. Chastain shows the mental torture Maya faces due to frustration, stress, and fear of finding this monster. She delivers a very good performance. What's interesting about Zero Dark Thirty is that Maya isn't the only character who is primarily shown. In the scene when Bin Laden is killed, we get lots of screen time before and during the attack with the navy seals who executed him. We see other terrorists being investigating, see other events that led to killing of Bin Laden, and see the damage he created. The films opens brilliantly with old 9/11 calls to remind the audience how evil Bin Laden was. Katherine Bigelow does a fine job of directing by capturing the stressful lead up of the mission and not just having the film focus on Osama's death. And boy when his death comes, you won't know what hit you. Even knowing what happens before the film, you will be completely shocked during his death scene. Bigelow shoots it in the eyes of the navy seals perfectly, adding infrared vision in the shot. This film was edited superbly to make the film extremely intense and provocative. The screenplay by Mark Boal was well-done due to showing the story in a detailed way and by giving the film a complex plot that wasn't all about killing Bin Laden. Many non-fiction films are good at just showing how it happened and doing it exactly as you think it happened. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is eye-opening, thrilling, exciting and shows you just how hard it was to protect the American people from a dangerous man, and to seek vengeance for those who lost their lives due to the war on terror.",Null,0,1,6 June 2014
Mudbound," 'Mudbound' has all the right pieces, but doesn't know how to put them together,
","'Mudbound' is a highly overrated film and is deeply disappointing. Coming from a weak script that doesn't allow us to emphasize or truly understand any of the characters enough, the film has a promising plot that fizzles from its inception. While the last half-hour or so of the film is gripping and moving at times, the overall film struggles to identify itself and fire out what it strives to do. Coming from underused performances and lacking enough pure drama to hit home, director Dee Rees fails at directing a major drama. Mostly boring, this film is also technically weaker, not using the landscapes and setting to the cinematography's
advantage, but rather repeating the same filming style that ceases to inspire. 'Mudbound' is a huge let-down and isn't worth the hype.",Null,1,4,3 February 2018
Love Actually," 'Love Actually' is the single most overrated rom-com.
","Pretty much every British actor is in the most overrated and highly praised romantic comedy in the last decade. 'Love Actually' has its heart in the right place but never executes a funny or heartwarming scene. This film lacks everything in terms of comedy and originality. This film goes the easy route and follows a bunch of different couples in London that never really interact or crash into each other near Christmas. There's unrequited love, loneliness, child love, adultery, and more in this love packed disaster. Liam Neeson plays Daniel, a lonely dad who has to take care of his son Sam after his wife death. Sam is in love with a girl at school. Bill Nighy plays Billy Mack, a singer who sings about love songs and is intimate with women. Jamie (Colin Firth) is a stressed writer who travels to France and falls in love with someone who doesn't even speak English. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman play a married couple who have one of them cheating in the marriage, while the irritating Keira Knightly plays a recently married woman who's husbands best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with her. There are few more stories, one involving Laura Linney as a single woman in love with her employee and the other with Hugh Grant as a businessman with love troubles. Every story is more sappy or irritating than the next. Not one story ends in a realistic ways or is even inspiring. They all end ridiculously and predictably. This is also one of the most sexual films of all time. The sex is a little uncomfortable and doesn't fit right with the failed tender-hardheartedness that was attempted. This lovey mess could have been sweet, but it never ends and gets more useless and vulgar as it goes on. One of the worst romantic comedies you'll ever see and an absolute unbalanced mess.",Null,0,3,12 September 2014
12 Years a Slave," '12 Years a Slave' is a powerful story with great historical material and importance!
","When looking back at America's disturbing past of holding slavery to be righteous, you become moved by films like this. '12 Years a Slave' is a strong story about Solomon Northup, a once violinist from New York turned slave in the south. The film shows how he went from kidnapped to sold to moved in a powerful and sickening way. Chiwetel Ejofer plays Solomon excellently, delivery strong emotions and fear. As the film progresses you get to observe just how hard being a slave truly is, and Chiwitel nails it. Every scene he is full of artistic talent that makes the audience moved into feeling for his character. Michael Fassbender gives the best performance as Edwin Epps, a brutal Louisiana slave master who owns Solomon Northup. The fear he gives to the audiences makes every scene he's in go still and chill. Fassbender's southern accent and yelling scenes along with brutality make his character come to life, and cause a sense of hatred towards his character. Lupita Nyong'o plays Patsy, a physically and emotionally abused slave who is the best at picking cotton. The horrendous things done to poor Patsy are sickening and show you how slaves were treated ion a very vivid and graphic manner. This is a film that should be shown in schools while learning about American history due to the superb historical relevance and accuracy. John Ridley's story is filled with detail that makes you see how slavery was like for the poor slaves. He adds excellent dialogue and chilling scenes that leave you speechless and moved. Steve Mcqueen's directing is outstanding as he captures spectacular footage about the hardships of slavery in the 1800's. The other film aspects such as costume and production design, editing, cinematography and score put together the powerful puzzle and bring you a strong film that will hit hard and hopefully make you feel lucky to be free.",Null,0,2,3 June 2014
There Will Be Blood," There will be pleasure if you see 'There Will Be Blood'!
","One of the best films in decades is a film about an oilman and the transformation he experiences. Daniel-Day Lewis gives perhaps the greatest performance by an actor in a leading role of all time as Daniel Plainview, an oil man who in the late 1800's adopts a boy who is the son of his deceased oil partner, and goes to a vast land in California owned by a bizarre Christian family who make a business deal with Daniel in order for him to drill oil. The man in charge of the deal is Eli Sunday, an insanely crazy preacher played brilliantly by Paul Dano. Plainview deals with many natural resources as well. The procedure to extract oil off the land doesn't go as planned. Many problems occur and the relationship between Daniel and Eli is very rough. Through the drilling and work Daniel experiences, he becomes very greedy, vengeful, and dark. The honest and caring businessman we see in the beginning transforms into a unique character from the brilliant mind of Paul Thomas Anderson. Anderson's story is so unique and focuses on one character the whole time mainly. With a story that has very few characters and a plot taking place form the late 1800's to the early 1900's he does a perfect job intriguing us to see how Daniel Plainview becomes a monster. What's interesting is that you'll root for him to succeed and become as vengeful as possible. I know I did. The reasoning behind this is that Daniel Plainview is such a brilliant character and is acted superbly and eccentrically by Daniel-Day Lewis. The brilliant story and fantastic directing by Paul Thomas Anderson is just a set-up for one of the best acting jobs in the history of art to be unleashed like a dog on rabies. DDL's outgoing anger, loud yelling, running, and daunting facial expressions come at you like a train and there's no way to resit his amazement. 'There Will Be Blood' is one of the decades strongest films due to how it succeeds in every category. The scenery and cinematography capture the film's beauty and show the time period it's in to deliver a visual appeal to this monumental work of art. PTA gives his finest film yet with amazing directing and writing and gives us one of cinema's all- time greatest hits. There will be blood in the story, but there will be history from this classic film.",Null,0,2,3 July 2014
Joker," 'Joker' is a mesmerizing societal examination with one of the greatest acting performances in film history.
","One of the most anticipated films of 2019 and without a doubt the most controversial, the infamous Clown Prince of Crime has gotten yet another film. This time in 'Joker,' a stand-alone film dedicated solely to the character examination of this iconic villain.Ever since 'Joker' - directed and co-written by Todd Phillips - premiered last month at the Venice Film Festival where it won the top prize, the film has generated a tremendous amount of controversy due to the way many feel that the film could inspire mentally-ill individuals or internet-community members known as incels to commit violent acts. Theaters across the country have called for increased security, families of the victims of the Aurora Theatre shootings in 2012 have condemned the film, and authorities have been monitoring potentially suspicious behavior.While those concerns are valid, 'Joker' isn't trying to idolize psychopaths and inspire any killing sprees. What Phillips does is rather examine the societal phenomena and issues that fragment society and leave several individuals, especially those with mental illnesses, behind.Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, an aspiring stand-up comedian who exists as a clown-for-hire in the crumbling city of Gotham. Arthur spends almost all of his life in solitude, being violently harassed by those on the streets and is completely disregarded by society. Suffering from childhood trauma and a neurological condition that causes uncontrollable laughter, Arthur is pushed too far and eventually falls down a spiral of brutal violence.Playing the role of such an iconic comic book character, especially after the late Heath Ledger's earth-shattering portrayal in 2008's 'The Dark Knight,' is a daunting challenge for any actor. Luckily, Phillips assigns one of the world's greatest actors to take on the role, leading to one of the most unsettling and astonishing performances you'll ever see.The depths that Joaquin Phoenix took and executed as an actor become overwhelming to the viewer. Losing as astounding 52 pounds to give this psychopathic character a diseased skeleton look, Phoenix masters every subtle nuance and move that Arthur takes, bringing this character to life. It makes us connect to him due to his agony, yet fear him due to his unsettling actions and disturbing behavior. Phoenix acts like a 10-year-old boy who doesn't understand the world, his every action filled with a lack of confidence and constant fear.While it's impossible not to somewhat empathize with Arthur, his behavior becomes increasingly unsettling and haunting as the film progresses thanks to the loose-cannon of a performance that Phoenix delivers with staggering intensity and depth. After only about five minutes into the film, it becomes evident that this was a part he was born to play.Phillips, known for making raunchy comedies like 'The Hangover,' excels as a director who makes it clear that he not only has a vision but that he can reach heights as a creative artist. He creates not only an intimate character study about the horrors of social isolation but depicts a universal story about societal fragmentation and mental illness, one that can hit audiences and stay with them.He doesn't preach to us about the need for societal reforms, but rather expresses what the film is trying to say eloquently through the chilling and disturbing lifestyle of Arthur. Blending both characterization and societal examination is a task many directors fail at when pursuing their ambition, but Phillips excels tremendously at getting his message across.From a technical standpoint, 'Joker' is jaw-dropping. The film captures the alienation of Arthur and his harsh environment with a stunning noir style that mirrors films like 'Taxi Driver' and 'A Clockwork Orange' but with a modern tone that evokes bleak hopelessness that's intoxicating. Rich cinematography and an inviting score make the film impossible to turn away from.Much of the controversy surrounding 'Joker' is its violence. While there are indeed moments of violence, the real horror isn't the actual violence but the reasoning behind its occurrence. The transformation of Arthur Fleck into the Joker is truly discomforting, not only because of the heartbreaking reasons that lead him to violence but because of how society specifically shaped him unintentionally.'Joker' acts on this idea on how being a victim of bullying can lead you down a path of violence, capturing what it's like to be mentally ill through the eyes of Joaquin Phoenix's master acting.Is society to blame for the violence and hopelessness caused by so many killers? It's a troubling thought, but one that can't be ignored. Phillips and Phoenix dive into it and give us something to think about, not turning their eyes away from something just because it may be uncomfortable to explore.Surrounding the other dialogue 'Joker' is creating, there's much to speculate as to how this film will connect to future DC Comic films. With both a young Bruce Wayne and his father Thomas featured in this film, one can hope that we'll see this Joker in other films. Despite Phillips denying any plans to continue Arthur's story, it seems absurd not to feature this intriguing character and brilliant performance in other films. Having a villain with a clear and interesting backstory could be a strong asset if the Joker were to appear as a villain in a future film.'Joker' may be an unsettling film to watch, but it elevates the comic book film through its artistic style and bold move to add an infectious amount of grit to one of pop culture's most famous characters.Like many other films, 'Joker' will most likely be met with criticism for a while before finally being appreciated years later. In a time where everyone is quick to point fingers and criticize without giving enough time to analyze what exactly they're criticizing, many will miss what 'Joker' is trying to get at and express.",Null,0,1,9 October 2019

At this particular institution, one of the meanest and most irritating film characters ever put on screen rules the asylum and treat the patients terribly.

The Wolf of Wall Street," 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a high-energy rush with a reflective message about America.
","Martin Scorsese's 'The Wolf of Wall Street' delivers the world with drugs, sex, greed, humor and a strong message about how we as Americans are always unhappy with what we have and always need more to be satisfied. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as Jordan Belfort, a once calm and quiet guy to a drug-fueled, wealthy stockbroker causing crimes towards his clients in order to become a multi-millionaire. His crimes included stock market manipulation and penny stock scams. Jordan's partner, Donny Azoff (Jonah Hill), is just as greedy and rambunctious. He joins Jordan on his penny stocks, manipulation, prostitutes, drugs, and money. Jonah Hill adds a sense of comedy to fulfill the natural humor of the men's lives, and when tasked to act serious he delivers the performance of his career. Jordan's hot wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) foolishly marries him and gets manipulated as well by Jordan's lifestyle. Terrence Winter's f-bombed filled screenplay is done brilliantly in the narration form. He gives a clear understanding of what life was like for Jordan Belfort , and doesn't add foolish dialogue or unneeded text. Scorsese gives such an energy to this film that it feels like an hour opposed to three hours.He adds partying, intense drugs scenes, sex, comedy, lawbreaking and much more that revolves around the true message of American greed and how we as Americans are unsatisfied with what we have. The similarities between 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and Scorsese's finest picture 'Goodfellas' are incredible. Both stories tackle on the theme of greed, both protagonist are shown in the good and bad times of their activities and the relationships with women, the supporting cast is greatly shown, the protagonist is shown from rise to fall, and the energy and length gives you great vision of the crime in American society. Leonardo Dicaprio delivers a brilliant performance and gets Terrence Winter and Martin Scorsese's message out beautifully. His character is never satisfied with the amount of money he has (even when he is worth millions), isn't satisfied with his multiple women he cheats on, doesn't have the proper amount of drugs, homes, resources, boats, you name it more is never enough, hence the tagline.",Null,2,5,2 June 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Who cares about the unhistorical plot-lines, you won't find a more intoxicating thriller and a bolder look at history.
","Criticism after criticism about elements of historical biopics that either were left out or added in that don't work can butcher a response to a certain film. News flash! Making a textbook into a movie isn't what biopics are about. Talented writers and directors know how to get a controlling theme or idea about someone without having to read notes from their 7th grade history class. By adding in drama or even complex characters, we're able to get an interesting perspective at historical time periods and people. 'The Last King of Scotland' is based on the events of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's regime as seen by his personal physician during the 1970s. Amin, played ferociously by Forest Whitaker in an Oscar- winning performance, was truly a psychotic human being. Responsible for over 300,000 deaths, we see the international outrage that arises due to Amin's brutality. The thing that turned people off from this film wasn't the harsh subject matter, but the fact that Idi Amin's physician, Dr. Nicolas Garrigan, never even existed. Many call that underachieving, I call it brilliance. James McAvoy portrays the fictional Scottish doctor as a crazy adventure-seeker who changes drastically once seeing Amin for what he truly is. The performances by Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy are remarkable and it's tragic to see the outcome of their characters bondage. McAvoy's character is used to show the world's realization of the horrific brutality Idi Amin caused. Through this doctor we get a heart- pounding political thriller that both transforms what we know into an unpredictable nail-bitter and reminds us of the horrors of Amin's reign. With a subtle memoriam to those who lost their lives in Uganda during the 70's, 'The Last King of Scotland' is directed with perfection by the great Kevin Macdonald by illustrating history with a rapid heartbeat and an ounce or two of bold creativity flourishing with bravery. By adding intriguing shots filled with tension, he brings peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock's riveting story to live with ferocious talent. Hands down this is a true highlight of biography storytelling that educates us and provokes us.",Null,0,1,17 January 2015
It Chapter Two," A fulfilling end to Stephen King's masterful story despite flaws
","Stephen King's masterful horror epic 'IT' captured both the trauma and beauty of childhood in such a captivating fashion in 2017. The adaptation not only became the highest-grossing horror film of all time but was a mesmerizing and unforgettable game changer.Twenty-seven years after we last saw the Losers' Club seemingly defeat Pennywise, the demonic dancing clown entity, the now-adult gang of misfits is forced to return to Derry, Maine to fight It once and for all.This was one of my most anticipated films of the year due to my adoration for the first film and King's original novel. 'IT: Chapter Two' is successful in concluding the story it started two years ago, containing yet another blend of action, scares and heart that pays great tribute to its source material. However, it doesn't live up to the expectations set upon it due to a less focused plot and struggling to find a proper pace.Yet again, returning director Andy Muschietti had a vision that brings this story to film beautifully. That said, the director struggles this time on how to initiate his vision in addition to making the film a little too long at 169 minutes.The big step of casting the Losers' Club as adults couldn't have been handled better. James McAvoy is terrific as Bill Denbrough, who while still guilt-ridden over the death of his younger brother, Georgie, has become a famous writer. Jessica Chastain portrays Beverly Marsh, who brings both fierceness and sweetness that makes us admire her as a character.My biggest issue in the depiction of these two adult characters is how little time they spend together despite their past chemistry. Bill and Beverly had a sweet romance in the novel that was a treasure to read. But, in the film, the two barely talk to each other and act as if they never loved each other as kids.Ben Hanscomb (Jay Ryan), now thin and fit, has fulfilled his dream in becoming an architect and is still in love with Beverly, creating a slight love triangle before Bill and Beverly's connection simply fizzles.Bill Hader is spot on as Richie 'Trashmouth' Tozier and fulfills the role as the funny guy after becoming a successful stand up comic. Hader offers great comic relief and is also able to show his dramatic talents consistently. The character of Richie is taken into a slightly changed direction, which isn't explored enough to become compelling.Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransome) has become a successful businessman, yet remains a paranoid hypochondriac. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is the most reluctant to return to Derry to defeat Pennywise out of fear and finds his loyalties to his friends tested. Meanwhile, Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) is the sole member of the gang to remain in Derry, who spent the last 27 years as a librarian, researching how to kill It.'Chapter Two' struggles to make the adult characters as compelling and emotionally investing as the children. The kids from 'IT' were charismatic and relatable, who accurately captured the struggles of growing up, whereas the adults aren't able to emulate that same spirit of the kids' performance.To instill an emotional core to a higher level, the film brings back a seemingly endless amount of flashbacks to when the Losers were kids, which varies between heartfelt and unnecessary. At times it feels like Muschietti doesn't trust his audience enough to remember the characters when they were kids and forces us to spend a tremendous amount of time with the kids once again.While flashbacks are necessary for this film, the staggering amount of screen time the kids get distracts us from the focus of 'Chapter Two' and makes the adults feel like extended versions of the kids and not changed characters who have developed over the last 27 years.'Chapter Two' strangely mixes up its momentum by rushing through the reintroductions of each character to take them all back to Derry. It would have been much better to spend more time with each of the Losers in their new lives after such a long-time period instead of each getting one scene with just a brief glimpse of their lives.In Derry, the storyline becomes a tad misguided when each individual is forced on solo missions that take each into flashback sequences of their own, detracting from the current conflict. It's as if Muschietti forgot he already had each kid face their fears in the first film, and for some reason, decides to show us what they're afraid of yet again with scenes similar to what we've already seen.Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is just as creepy and extroverted as before. While we get to see a larger variety of forms that It takes as an entity, the form of Pennywise is by far the best. Most of the monsters we see are very creepy and well designed digitally, yet it's Pennywise that we all want to see. At times the monsters depicted on-screen feel rather goofy and weird as opposed to frightening, making it hard to be scared and take the film seriously.That said, 'IT: Chapter Two' gives us an epic climax that is impossible to turn away from. The Losers get the ultimate showdown with Pennywise in one of the most memorable action sequences filled with character-driven emotion and arresting CGI.While slightly disappointing, the second half of 'IT' is an exciting and heartfelt ending full of heart that is centered around a group of characters impossible not to care for and concludes Stephen King's masterpiece epically, giving fans of the nearly 1,200-page novel what they need to be more than satisfied.",Null,2,2,12 September 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Hilarious from start to finish! A creative comedy with brilliant casting as well!
","News anchoring requires three critical qualities in order to qualify. 1: Good hair. 2: Being able to charm your viewers. 3: Having class. Ron Burgandy is a cinematic character who reinvented this criteria in order to move us. By move us I mean make us laugh our asses off. Will Ferrell does his most outrageous and hilarious work in 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.' Ron Burgundy is a handsome, charming (at least what were supposed to believe) San Diego news Anchor who with his news team report the news in a legendary fashion during the 1970's. We have Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana, a ladies man who reports in the field, Steve Carrell as Brick Tamland a mentally insane and dim-witted weather man and David Koechner as the raw sports analyst. Together, the four men are comedic brilliance and do a fine job reporting the news until Ron Burgandy is challenged by a female reporter, Veronica Corninigstone (a sweetly funny Christina Applegate)who causes a plot by adding competition to Ron. This film is the type of comedy that after seeing it the third time it starts to get old. The first two times are a blast. Will Ferrell is so funny in this film that just looking at him makes me grin. The supporting cast is very funny as well and together the cast holds a great chemistry put together by directer Adam McKay. There are many patches of dialogue that will stick with you and make you laugh by thinking of them, but really the fact that Will Ferrell pretends to be serious and how motivated Ron Burgundy is to 'saving the day' is what tickles your ribs. This is a very entertaining comedy that deserves to be seen more than once.",Null,0,1,14 August 2014
The Green Mile," 'The Green Mile' is an underrated work of art about the characteristics of fantasy and reality.
","Frank Darabont five years after the classic 'Shawshanke Redemption' creates another prison drama that is a balance between the real world and fantasy. With Tom Hanks being the lead, you already know your off to a terrific start. Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a warden at a Louisiana prison in the 1930's who stumbles upon a new prisoner, John Coffey, who changes his life forever. Coffey is a huge African-American man who is accused of raping and murdering two young girls. We get to see extremely powerful flashbacks of the victims family searching around their land for their daughters, who eventually find Coffey holding the dead girls while screaming his head off. Michael Clark Duncan plays John Coffey amazingly, and in this scene in particular you will find one of the greatest scenes in acting history from this talented artist. Paul and John end up forming a relationship, causing Paul to find out that John has special healing powers and that he is in fact innocent. The story turns into a portrayal of honesty, trust, and chance. There's so much more conflict going on inside the prison that you won't be lost for a second. We have Percy, a cruel prison guard causing tension around the prison, many other prisoners and executions and a crazy prisoner that brings up a lot of questioning. Frank Darabont has proved to us that he is the master at making prison films. 'The Green Mile' is a powerful film with tremendous acting and a very original story. I love how we get a great background of every character and every event shaped without spoiling the big mysteries and climaxes the film has. The balance between murder mystery and natural human emotions and motifs from these profound characters builds a perfect bond of mystery and compassion. Two other elements that are calculated well are the separation between fantasy and reality. We get an overwhelmingly natural portrayal of a prison from the 30's and natural characters played perfectly by each actor to give a realistic tone to the film, and yet we get a man who's basically as superhero that works to fight with the struggles of a tough, realistic situation. 'The Green Mile' is a film that brings up a lot about how to better enjoy life and how experiences from the past can stay with us forever. An absolute terrific film!",Null,0,2,29 July 2014
Jaws," Spielberg's masterful horror film provokes the senses and is still effective 40 years later.
","The reason we're so damn scared of sharks lurking in the water is because of one man: Steven Spielberg. His most iconic film revolves around a killer shark terrorizing a local town in California. With classic music and the unaware presence and location of the mighty beast, Spielberg has truly crafted a terrorizing film. 'Jaws' is not only a classic film, it's the begging of a major fear in nature. Sharks are deadly creatures, there's no doubt, but the initial fear of these majestic creatures started once the 'dun dun dun' music and the mysterious camera view from the sharks perspective hit the screen in the 70's. Every horror filmmaker should learn from this film. Instead of pouring boodles of blood constantly and showing gratuitous guts and bodies being mutilated (which is pretty much all you get in horror film,s these days), Stevey makes your mind scared, and it's his subtlety that messes you with and makes you jump from your couch. We only see Jaws for about five minutes on screen. Yet he scares us throughout. We don't know what the heck we're dealing with, that's why we get scared. We don't know where he is in the water or who he will strike next. The direction that leads us into fear of the unknown is why this is a classic. Steven Spielberg made his legendary work likable due to not only his masterful use of horror, but his cutting edge visual effects. Once we do see Jaws, it's a sight to be reckoned with. Nowadays we're so use to magnificent special effects that this would seem like nothing. But from a 1975 perspective, this is mind- blowing. Steven Spielberg's classic tale of horror and the relationship between man and nature is a film you really must see to call yourself a true movie fanatic.",Null,2,4,3 May 2015
The Wrestler," Mickey Rourke delivers a hard-hitting and miraculous performance.
","Mickey Rourke's performance in 'The Wrestler' is truly mesmerizing. Rarely do we see actors so immersed in their character and rarely do we feel as badly as we do for his character. He plays Randy 'The Ram,' a washed-up and lonely pro wrestler whose life has fully collapsed. His strained relationship with his daughter haunts him as he seeks for connection with the people around him. 'The Wrestler' is a powerful character study about acceptance and obsession, what we'll do to find meaning in the world and how much it takes before we have to let go. Darren Aronofsky doesn't do anything special as a director here. The film is completely guided by Rourke's amazing performance. He and co-star Marisa Tomei are phenomenal and leave you with heavy hearts long after the credits role.",Null,2,2,30 December 2017
Hancock," What a strange movie!
","Vince Gilligan and Vincent Ngo have come up with a really clever idea for an action film that comes out as strange and unsettling. 'Hancock' is about a superhero who isn't much of a hero and more of a lazy bum with a bad reputation. Hancock (Will Smith) does some pretty bad things that are not evil but unprofessional. He tries to change his life around when he meets Ray (Jason Bateman) by saving his life. Ray tries to help him out and get back on his feet. Hancock soon has a mysterious relationship with Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron). The superpowers of Hancock are very diverse. He can fly, has incredible strength, and takes down all the villains of Los Angeles, just costs the city millions due to his destruction. I would have liked to see more action that had strong visual effects. The action is very unoriginal. When Hancock has to take out criminals, it's more comedic than entertaining. 'Hancock' is very strange due to the energy it has. It goers by very slow. We also have to sit through Hancock being a total jerk to innocent people, which to be honest feels a little cruel. It's creative to have a superhero be unloved for once, and to have to make a comeback in order to prove his heroism, but the idea of Hancock being a drunken bum was overplayed. There's some really strange scenes that make this movie all the more off-putting. Will Smith gives a good performance because he feels the part. Smith gets tiring though, and it's really hard to root for him due to being such as jerk. The rest of the movie is really ridiculous, and doesn't have any charm that could have be used. Director Peter Berg makes this a really dirty film. He uses no good camera work, and kinda just tells everyone what to do instead of actually giving some creative talent into the film. The script is hardly revised, the visual elements are weak, and the acting is overdone. 'Hancock' overall scared the hell out of me!",Null,1,1,19 October 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Epic entertainment!
","The final installment in Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' trilogy is two and a half hours of non-stop action without any real plot points of character focus. That's why it works. Peter Jackson knows what kind of audience he hit with this trilogy adapted from a single 250 page book. He's reaching the 'popcorn' audience who just want to have fun and be visually arrested for a bit. Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the hands of a rising darkness, leading into non-stop action sequences. This film has gorgeous CGI and wonderful visuals that embrace everything about this type of fantasy. While it doesn't have the beauty or complexity of the visuals in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, it does have more fun and more ridiculous action to keep you consistently entertained from start to finish. Starting with a dragon attack, ending with the last orc kill, 'The Battle of the Five Armies' is a joy to watch even though there's way more than five armies and even though this could have been the last twenty minuets of a stand alone hobbit film.",Null,0,2,7 June 2016
Inception," 'Inception' is a vivid adventure of the mind and work of exceptional creativity.
","Look, you probably won't fully understand 'Inception' no matter how hard you try. So what. This film is more about viewing and experiencing than understanding. Christopherr Nolan as a director crafts something truly extraordinary and historical in the means of film history. 'Inception' is a visual marvel and an adventure of the mind that will have you thinking your head off and will amaze the eyes. Leonadaro Dicaprio gives a cool performance as Cobb, a thief who steals corporate secrets through use of the dream-sharing technology who is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO. Huh? Yeah, basically people go inside the dreams of people and then end up in other people's dreams. It's funky. Nolan could have done a better job of making it easier to follow. But hey, when there's people floating around and fighting in mid-air and excellent slow-mo car chases and Leo, it turns out to be a joyous ride with fun and excitement in every scene.",Null,0,1,22 December 2015
Sherlock Holmes," One of the worst movies in years.
","'Sherlock Holmes' fails in every way imaginable. There isn't one aspect of this film that feels fresh and original, which is vital for remaking a story and putting it to life. Robert Downy Jr. and Jude Law play Holmes and Watson, giving forced and fake performances while lacking any chemistry between the detective partnership. Let's just say this film moves slower than a tortoise, taking forever to become interesting or engaging. What would have helped is if it was made with more of a dark undertone, gripping the audience in to a more complex portrayal of crime and law.

For nearly two hours her and the bland Jeremy Renner try and figure out what the aliens are saying, a ridiculous and boring plot that fails to make its substantial nature revealed. What happens next is a series of mind-bendeling reveals relating to time and space that don't fit anywhere into the story and leaves us with a rather bitter ending.

The Shawshank Redemption," A classic film that everyone should see!
","Prison is a gloomy and dark place that can contain beauty if worked on. Friendships can be formed, enjoyment can be experienced, and freedom can sometimes be felt. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a very popular film that contains world class film-making and interesting life-lessons that can be applied from prison to the free world. Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who is convicted of murdering his wife, a crime he didn't commit. After being sent to the Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, Andy encounters some tough people including a brutal prison guard and ruthless prisoners and lives in constant fear. Andy soon meets Red, a contraband smuggler with a life sentence played by Morgan Freeman in the greatest performance of his life. The two form a special friendship and find how to make the best of their situation. As the men get different jobs in the prison, attempt escape, and experience different feelings, the men try to redeem this depressing prison and find a better life. This story is an absolute cinematic icon and there is no questioning as to why this is a classic work of art. The friendship formed between Andy and Red is one of the most fascinating things to watch form in cinema, as we get elaborate character development and watch the unfolding of a beautiful friendship come to life in a depressing location. The extra tad's such as the use of foreshadowing and flashbacks writer Frank Darabont uses creative detail and complexity to make this story special. Darabont also directs this film and portrays a prison life in shockingly unique ways. He focuses on all the hardships that make prison seem nightmarish, but also shows how prison can be the best place on earth when you have a friend and enjoyment in difficult situations. The themes of persistence and hope that are brought up in this film can relate to anyone's situation whether free or in prison. Darabont adapts Stephen King's story to show us how in order to live we need freedom, and without hope you will never achieve it. This is a classic example of pure 90's film-making and stands as one of the best classics of all time. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the greatest narrative stories ever told and brings so much up that can inspire the world on how to achieve meaning in life.",Null,1,1,21 July 2014
Parasite," Unlike Anything You've Ever Seen
","The winner of the prestigious Palme D'or back in May at the Cannes Film Festival, South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has crafted the most original and entertaining film of 2019 in 'Parasite,' a film layered in style and creativity.Set in South Korea, 'Parasite' follows the unemployed Kim family of four living in dire poverty in the metropolitan slums who collaboratively take an interest in the extremely wealthy Park family and one by one infiltarte their house through a master plan of schemes and lies to be employed by them. The patriarch, Kim ki-Taek, strives to become the Parks' personal chauffeur, the matrich, Moon-gwang, pursues a position as the family's maid, while their son and daughter Kim Ki-woo and Kim Ki-jung become tutors for the family's son and daughter.Each family member goes to extreme lengths to pull off their deceptive lies in order to maintain their positions, a testament to the desperate measures impoverished people are willing to go in order to get by these days. Joon Ho manages to examine the increasing inequalities between the rich and poor without ramming a political social statement down our throats. Instead, the filmmakers subtly exemplifies how both wealthy and poor people are shaped by a competitive global capitalist economy, never taking a side on which family is more of a moral embodiment.Joon Ho expresses how people of both wealth and poverty leach off each other like parasites, the Kim family leaching off of their wealthy employers the Parks, while the Parks leach off of them for their labor. Joon Ho reveals how we as human beings use each other for personal gain and how such a relationship is embodied in our society. The fashion he used to express such a phenomenon is one of pure cinematic magic, a rich story that hits you like an ocean wave and takes twists and turns like you can't imagine.'Parasite' plays out as a darkly comedic satire, it's dark comedy sharp and poignant, yet eventually takes a direction that no one will be able to see coming. Joon Ho's ingenious script and artistic cinematic direction lead us into a film that is simply unlike anything in the history of cinema. This is a film that is able to make us laugh one minute and then have our hearts beating out of our chests the next due to the gripping and riveting intensity on screen.What gives the film a test for the audience is how we genuinely want the Kims tos succeed with their plan despite their vicious lies and desperation. Each actor delivers a humorous yet mesmerizing performance that captures the emotions and frustrations of not only poverty, but of determination and blind ambition.Director Bong Joon Ho proves he's one of the world's very best filmmakers with not only his brilliant story, but the way he's able to manipulate the audience from start to finish and craft a film with sharp imagery that illuminates the eyes. He creates an individualistic film style built upon pitch-perfect editing, gorgeous opera music that captures the film's mood, shocking twists and gripping conflict.'Parasite' will surely be a major contender for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards and is one of the most memorable foreign films of the 21st century. This is the kind of film that shows you what movies can do and one that makes you fall in love with cinema again.",Null,20,32,1 December 2019
Rango," Kind of challenging for younger viewers to contemplate, but it's a fun ride throughout with ongoing works of terrific animation.
","No one can deny Johnny Depp playing the voice of a little chameleon named Rango! This little reptile is just too lovable. Depp has the perfect voice for playing Rango, an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff. Looks like it's gonna turn cold blooded in Dirt! Rango is a riot to watch stumble upon new challenges. Gore Verbinski as a director knows how to please sophisticated audiences who still enjoy a terrific tale of creative animation. This film is honestly not suitable for kids under the age of nine or ten. There's lots of WTF moments that feel like something out of an old western that is way over younger viewers heads. That's the beauty of this film. It allows adults to stumble out of the cutesy animated crap that flood multiplexes nationwide, and experience a warm story that despite a reptile as a lead, is warm blooded. There's tons of fun action and funny moments that never lead to anything stupid or slow. 'Rango' stays kind of still for some sequences, never really cutting to the chase and wrapping up the story, but you'll be thoroughly entertained by a new animated gem.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 'Birdman' has provoen to audiences everywhere what movies can do and how film is a beautiful form of art.
","The best film of 2014 is a story that can only be described once you've seen it. The bottom line is that Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, a washed-up actor famous for playing an old superhero named Birdman, who tries to reconnect with his family and fans by creating and staring in a Broadway play. Easy as that may sound, Riggan struggles from the voice of his old superhero haunting him and criticizing him on what he's become. With Edward Norton acting as Riggan's fellow stage actor with a serious ego and Emma Stone playing his druggie daughter, Riggan struggles to find meaning in his life and not be haunted by his image in the world. Director and writer Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu directs this movie in every scene. Not only does the cinematography consist of basically one long shot throughout the whole film that is executed and edited perfectly, but you feel the presence of a gifted artist guiding a meaningful film to production. The tracking shots, insightful quotes about the struggle to find meaning, the hints of superhero culture, and clues as to how everyone in the film is ignorant all help make 'Birdman' leave a strong impression on creative storytelling and show how brilliant this film truly is. With multiple WTF moments that are executed marvelously, dark comedic attributes, and a look behind the acting business, 'Birdman' soars in unique style and fashion that earns itself to be an instant classic. This is the kind of film that only intelligent film geeks will appreciate. Not only is the ending hard to understand, but the whole film will appear too artsy and creative for some to contemplate. 'Birdman' is the type of film that deals with human struggle and insight about life, as well as visual beauty. Keaton, Norton and Stone all give Oscar worthy performances that are filled with passion and wit. The true hero of this movie is Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu, for bringing a masterpiece to life and giving faith in cinema and what movies are capable of doing to the eyes and mind.",Null,3,9,14 August 2015
The Conjuring," Familiar territory but still delivers fun results!
","Audiences enjoy being scared so much that they'll pay $12 to see crappy horror films the first weekend they open. They'll love 'The Conjuring,' except that it isn't crappy and is actually, you know, scary! We've seen ghost movies like this for years. We still can't get over the unpredictable fright of spirits popping out of nowhere and terrorizing people in some old house. Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson play paranormal investigators named Ed and Lorraine Warren. Like every horror film trying to sell tickets, we see 'based on a true story' stuck to the poster before entertaining the theater. I know I know, but come on! We're supposed to fooled! Ed and Lorraine investigate an old mysterious house in the middle of nowhere that a family moved into. What could go wrong? Why do horror movie characters always live in some creepy old house! The opening of 'The Conjuring' is a little strange and laughable. The real beauty behind James Wan's directing is he makes it suspenseful instead of gory. We never know what demon with a fork in his butt is going to do next to these poor people. Even the credits at the end are terrifying! Wan takes a while for the horror to start kicking in. He makes tiny little clues that something is up, then delivers frightening sequences of scary fun. The one thing I would have taken out is the (SPOILER ALERT) exorcisms. Possessed people screaming their heads of is a little peculiar and not that scary. 'The Conjuring' isn't too original or artistic, but it's pure fun to scream your bloody head off.

Not a single character in this film is developed or interesting, and the actors of these soulless characters do the lamest job of acting imaginable. There isn't even that much action to enjoy! Many sci-fi films have lots of stupidity behind the cool visuals and cinematography they endure. 'Prometheus' contains many weird scenes that are very silly and annoying. The only thing that could give a little hint as to how the aliens films plot evolved is the last 5 seconds of the film.

Marriage Story," Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deliver two of 2019's most mesmerizing performances
","Take a look at any film critic's Top 10 List of 2019 and you will certainly find Noah Baumbach's 'Marriage Story' at the top. A guaranteed nominee for Best Picture at the upcoming Academy Awards and a likely contender to win, this is a film I wanted to adore and rave about to everyone, yet sadly the film falls short of glory to be fully deserving.'Marriage Story,' tells the break-up story of Nicole and Charlie, a married couple living in New York City who battle for custody of their son Henry in the process of a bitter divorce. Nicole is an actress who moves to Los Angeles after leading a role in a television series, where Charlie struggles to stay on his feet after moving to L.A. from New York during the legal process to stay connected with his son.What's interesting about this film is that both characters are very unlikeable and clearly selfish and bad romantic partners. Charlie's career ambition as a New York play director drives him more than his marriage, while Nicole's own selfishness and insecurity make her just as inadequate of a spouse. We never feel attached to one lead character over the other, which allows us as an audience to observe their marriage objectively and neutrally. There's never a 'good guy' in the pair, which serves as a challenge for the audience in gravitating to one or the other out of the two.While having selfish protagonists can make the viewing experience more enjoyable in certain films, in a story that is reliant on heavy emotions it's important to have characters we genuinely admire in order to experience an emotional investment. It's hard not to empathize with Charlie and Nicole in their toxic divorce, yet I wish they were more likable to enhance the emotional struggles this couple goes through to the viewer. Baumbach gives each character more attention and attributes than most filmmakers bother, yet we aren't able to like them simply because of how selfish they are as people and spouses.Baumbach crafts a strong script that finds room for charm even in depressing situations and allows us to learn about the personalities and motivations of Charlie and Nicole, yet he fails to make us root for them as a couple. The entire film we're aware that they should divorce and we immediately get the impression that they are not meant for each other. The only timer we ever really feel as if the divorce is an unfortunate event is towards the end when we get a well-executed full circle to the opening.Having a couple that we care about and want to see happy together would have been a far more effective narrative due to generating a stronger connection with the audience. The writer/director also centers his film more on the individual personal journeys of Charlie and Nicole and not their relationship. Not enough screen time captures the two together in a way that we can experience any unique features that make this couple unique nor do we see enough of their backstory together that allows us to see what the couple was like before they started the divorce process.The remarkable performances by Johansson and Driver are what make 'Marriage Story' a film worth celebrating. Actors belonging to two of the biggest blockbuster franchises in entertainment history ('The Avengers,' 'Star Wars') who are still capable of portraying real-life people in films that rely solely on story and not spectacle is a testament to the talents of these two actors. While not portraying likable characters, each actor exemplifies the brutal stress and sorrow of divorce and how it breaks down the soul.The two leads memorize lengthy scenes of dialogue and hit every note pitch-perfectly. One extended sequence in particular in which the couple has a loud, fiery argument is acting at its purest and finest, both actors' emotions so real and accurate it becomes infectious to watch. Johnasson and Driver make every second of the film worthwhile due to the sheer talent they possess in bringing these characters and their struggles to life.Laura Dern does great work as Nicole's tough-as-nails, passive-aggressive attorney, her character similar to her iconic Renada Klein in 'Big Little Lies.' Dern provides some comedic relief as well, her strong personality always present in every scene. Veteran actors Ray Liotta and Alan Alda also soar as Charlie's different attorneys, each embodying their characters in a spot-on manner.This is very much an actor's movie, similar to 'Kramer v. Kramer' and 'Revolutionary Road.' The film struggles to find its own voice and is clearly inspired by several other films. This is more of a divorce story than a marriage story, for we never really get to see the actual marriage at hand. We get the impression early on from its poignant opening montage in which both Charlie and Nicole narrate what they love about each other that we'll get to see the past and present of a beautiful marriage slowly fall apart, yet instead the film focuses solely on their divorce.'Marriage Story' is one of 2019's most acclaimed films. While you won't find better performances in almost any other film this year, it still struggles to deliver the emotional punch and kick necessary to touch something new. Noah Baumbach is clearly a gifted filmmaker who captures the nuances in human interactions and details each scene and his effort is present in every scene. He just gets lost along the way in finding the proper story to tell.",Null,5,9,9 December 2019

","For some god awful reason audiences pay top dollar for 'Shrek' films. There's been four of these tragically awful works put to screen, each one raising higher anticipation than the next. 'Shrek' does a fine job spending big bucks to place a different type of story out there with a hidden love. I say hidden because 'Shrek' is one of the more gritty animated features with a PG rating of all time. Instead of crafting gorgeous visuals with heartfelt to the point of tears stories like Disney Pixar, Dreamworks went for an original story that was not only extremely agitating but ruthlessly dull. Sure, everyone if special no matter if they're an ogre or an annoying donkey. How hard is it to figure out? We could guess where the heart was coming from based on the poster, except the heart never really comes. I will say 'Shrek' has some of the biggest and well-suited actors you can get for an animated film. An ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers), in order to regain his swamp, travels along with an annoying donkey (Eddie Murphy) in order to bring a princess (Cameron Diaz) to a scheming lord, wishing himself King. Pretty clever, huh? Not really. The story fails in a scheming scheme of rudeness and action. Each scene if more obnoxious than the next, leaving you either in love with this dim-witted story or ready to skip the next sequel Dreanmworks throws at us due to having no other creative ideas like Pixar or other animated film companies.",Null,1,4,11 December 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," The summer film event of 2012 is here in a great conclusion to a cool story!
","With the tragedy that occurred at a midnight screening in Aurora, Colorado, I feel everyone should see this film to honor those who lost their lives, and to finish watching the film for their own sake, and to honor the art of cinema.'The Dark Knight' of 2008 showed a new way of superhero films. It provided darkness and themes relating to politics, corruption, and evil that made it feel like a crime film. Christopher Nolan is back with another batman film in 'The Dark Knight Rises.' Eight years after experiencing the reign of the evil Joker, The Dark Knight or batman must defend Gotham city from Bane, a terrorist that's huge and destructive. Gotham city is soon under extreme attack as terrorism and destruction start to overthrow the city. The Dark Knight must return and face many consequences to keep humanity strong in Gotham. All the other characters are back including Commissioner Gordon, Alfred, Fox, and new characters including Cat Woman, Blake, and Miranda. This film is so entertaining that it's insane. There are lots of great fight sequences, explosions, and chases that give all the classic elements of a batman film. Christopher Nolan directs this film perfectly as he shoots every scene excellent. The sound, effects, and cinematography make modern cinema alive visually. This film also deals with strong themes such as redemption, corruption, terrorism, and bravery. It doesn't contain the rich chemistry of 'The Dark Knight' due to the villain not being as menacing and dark like Heath Ledger as the joker. Still, you get a great action film with exceptional film making that gives you a great time in which you'll be more than pleased by.",Null,3,5,16 June 2014
Black Panther," Just another garbage superhero film.
","'Black Panther' is an absolute joke. While entertaining at times, the entire film feels like a mockery of African culture, using stereotypic attributes of Africa to reimagine Wakanda. Each actor gives a fake African accent that is beyond forced. The narrative is nothing new or extraordinary, it's recycled and boring. Few films have such poor writing as this one, each scene having cringe-worthy dialogue that weakens everybody's acting. Michael B. Jordan especially gives a terrible performance, one of the worst actors we have around. The film looks like an old video game too, the production and costumes horrendously bad. Films like this are supposed to transport the audience to a new world, yet this film clearly reveals its set and CGI. It baffles me how critics and awards love this movie, for it is nothing new, unique, artistic, or special. It's no different than all the other typicalo sueprhero blockbusters that filmm tehatres and diffuse creativity.",Null,8,12,21 December 2018
Mother!," Darren Aronofsky shines as a director in the film he was born to make.
","People didn't respond well to 'Mother!' because they either didn't understand its role as a biblical analogy of humankind or they didn't appreciate its artistic, unique directorial vision. From the second the film starts, you'll be able to tell Darren Aronofsky is controlling the set, using his stylish, dark vision to depict the events and meanings behind the most famous biblical stories. Jennifer Lawrence knocks it out of the park in her very best performance. The emotional toll she puts into this perforce is staggering. Lawrence is an actress I'm not usually big on, but all that changed after seeing this film. Few filmmakers are as poignant and brilliant in calculating humankind as Aronofsky. In 'Mother!' he blends his passion for the environment and fascination with religion to deliver perhaps the most unique, daring, and unconventional masterpiece of the 21st century.",Null,0,3,29 May 2018
Signs," 'Signs' is an absolutely terrifying but inspiring thriller!
","There are signs all around us about making life the best we can. M. Night Shyamalan directs and writes this brilliant thriller that can be used as a wake up for people struggling with anything. Mel Gibson stars as a small town man in Pennsylvania named Graham who lives with his two kids and brother Merill (Joaquin Phoenix)after loosing his wife in a car accident. Graham used to be a pastor at a church, but lost his faith after his wife's death. When mysterious crop circles and sightings of aliens occur in their farm and around he world, the family must fight to survive and keep each other safe. While trying to put together what really is happening, various signs about Graham's life are experienced. The title refers to signs of aliens, but also to being fulfilled in life. The aspect that I appreciate most in this film is how scary the film is without being overdone or violent. Very elusive, unpredictable scenes with great direction provide extreme shock due to fear of the unknown like Spielberg did in 'Jaws.' The aliens are also extremely terrifying looking that give great entertainment to the audience. Shyamalan also doesn't get carried away with making only scary scenes, instead he focuses on human struggle and family relationships that anybody can relate to. He makes such a personal story that makes you feel empathetic for each and every character. Mel Gibson gives a very moving performance and is great at acting shocked. This thriller has everything, and will keep you entertained throughout. What a thrilling experience!",Null,4,7,11 July 2014
The Deer Hunter," Remarkable. A work of classic and powerful mastery.
","'The Deer Hunter' won't give you the sensation of what it was like to fight on the battlefield in the jungles of southeast Asia. It won't show you the bloody and brutal violence that occurred in this horrible war. What it will give you is the psychological and emotional destruction that are brave soldiers experienced on the home-front after experiencing unimaginable horror. Michael Cimino s first up to show the true affects war has on both the individual and community level when Pennsylvania steel workers enlist into the Army to fight in Vietnam. After some time and many horrors, the men fall in the hands of the Vietcong and are brought to a prison camp in which they are forced to play Russian roulette against each other in perhaps the single most disturbing and intense scene in entertainment history. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep all deliver remarkable performances that allow you to connect with the pain and horror each character is facing. Few films can tackle so many deep feelings like 'The Deer Hunter,' while also keeping engaged at each conflict from start to finish. This is a powerhouse film of true horror and hope that deserves the title 'classic.'",Null,1,3,7 August 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Pure Genius- a once in a lifetime masterpiece.
","There are films that come around every now and then that seem to hit all the right notes and impact you in multiple ways. Very few times in my life as a film-goer have I seen a film that can make me laugh out loud in one moment, and then get me choked up literally 20 seconds later. Such is the beauty of New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi's 'JoJo Rabbit,' an absolute triumph of a film and quite possibly the best film of 2019.Set in Nazi Germany during WW II, 10-year-old JoJo is an avid supporter of radical fascist Adolf Hitler, brainwashed by Nazism as he dedicates himself to Hitler's Youth Army. JoJo is a social outcast, his only friend being his fellow Hitler Youth trainee Yorki. JoJo is bullied by his fellow Nazis, unable to find a place or purpose in his setting despite being so dedicated to the Fuhrer and his country.While sounding strange, JoJo envisions Hitler himself as his personal imaginary friend (played brilliantly and hilariously by writer/director/producer Taika Waititi), who guides him through his difficulties and fills a much-needed void in his socially isolated life. JoJo's mother Rosie, on the other hand, is against the Nazi ideology, hiding a Jewish girl named Elsa within their walls in protection. Having his world view challenged, young JoJo finds himself caught between his feelings of love for his mother and his surprising friendship with Elsa and his dedication to the only world and he has ever known.This is the type of film that could have very easily turned into an absolute disaster. So many films get overly ambitious with their outlandish stories that they end up crumbling down in their own goals and come off as pretentious rather than creative. Taika Waititi does a mesmerizing job of not only tackling this whacky concept for a film but delivers it in a pitch-perfect fashion that blends humor and heart masterfully. This isn't only the funniest film of the year, but the most heartwarming and moving film as well.Waititi proves he's a master of storytelling and assembles a film with humor that isn't just silly, but witty and profound. Having such daring humor in such a heavy subject matter is a bold move for any filmmaker to take, and the director excels in every bit of making us laugh at something we feel like we shouldn't be. Sam Rockwell, Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy from 'Game of Thrones'), and Rebel Wilson provide excellent comedic relief and are consistently hilarious, yet its newcomer Archie Yates as Yorki who proves he's a comedian in the making, the young actor without a doubt in the works of becoming a comedic star.Yet despite the genuine laugh-out-loud humor, Waititi grounds his film in a deep testament to love and coming-of-age. He doesn't center his film around Nazi Germany to get a rise out of people or show-off what he can do as a daring artist but rather uses his story to exert a beautiful tale of love and human growth. This is a film that most likely shouldn't have worked so well, yet Waititi's pure genius vision is delivered perfectly in every second of the film, his balance of comedy and heart an intoxicating phenomenon. This is cinema at its purest and most enjoyable form, executed perfectly from everyone working on the project.Newcomer Roman Griffin Davis is an acting force to be reckoned with. In what is without a doubt one of the greatest acting performances by a child of all time, Davis does a profound job of making audiences of all ages identify with a young child and adore him despite being a follower of Nazism. From start to finish, we're captivated by this young man's journey and genuinely want his future to be bright. We're able to recognize that JoJo is a sweet young boy and not a vicious Nazi and that he is simply a product of his environment. We're able to feel for this boy due to showing signs of a good heart and for struggling to find his purpose in a world he feels overwhelmed and excluded in. Davis captures the vulnerability and awkwardness of youth in ways that everyone will be able to relate too and is infectious with his soulful and heartfelt performance. This kid is 10 and already deserves his first Oscar nomination.Scarlet Johanson does terrific work as JoJo's mother and gives the film a sweetness due to her loving nature and motherly tendencies with her son. There are scenes in this film with Johansson that any mother would be able to identify with, the beautiful actress elevating an endearing emotional core to the film.Many have criticized the film for poking fun at such a disturbing time in history where millions of people were killed, but quite frankly those who criticize the film simply don't understand the satirical brilliance at work. This isn't a film that is trying to 'make light' of the holocaust or WW II but rather uses it as a mechanism to express a story of anti-hate.Taikia Waititi, a Jewish man himself, making us laugh as playing Hitler hilariously isn't in bad taste at all. Think about it. What better way to insult Hitler than have a Jewish man mock him and make him look like a complete fool? If Hitler saw this film he'd be infuriated, which alone is worth celebrating.Waititi is brilliantly expressing how brainwashed and pathetic Nazism is and uses JoJo as his protagonist to explore the meaning of love and move away from hate. It's refreshing to see a film completely ignore what the far-left woke culture will find fault with and profoundly make a film with a bold style that isn't afraid to be itself and move audiences with its tender story about love and empathy. Masterful works of cinema like this come around very rarely, making 'JoJo Rabbit' a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience.Creative films like this that can be so many things at once are a rare finding. Not only is this a stylish film with ambitious, well-composed cinematic techniques, but it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. The second it ended I wanted it to start back again from the beginning.This is a film that gives you faith not only in the power of cinema but in the beauty of humanity. 'JoJo Rabbit' has everything going for it without an issue in sight and is a film you deserve to see.",Null,4,13,1 November 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," 'Fantastic Mr.Fox' is the single greatest animated motion picture of all time, and stands as one of the most heartfelt and funny films in decades.
","Describing oneself as 'fantastic' is a very strong statement. The meaning of this word does not define ones ability to do things or fame from others. It simply is a word to describe the various types of good we as beings have. The perfect way to share this story is through animation! Wes Anderson's triumphant tale based on Roald Dahl's story called 'Fantastic Mr.Fox' is a delightful and inspiring animated feature that all audiences can relate to. George Clooney plays the voice of Mr.Fox, a reckless and brave critter who moves in to a new tree near some of the meanest farmers around. He lives with his swift and artsy wife Mrs.Fox (Meryl Streep), and their angry son Ash who doesn't seem to excel at anything. After Mr.Fox and his friend Kylie, an opossum, steal treats from the farmers farm, Mr.Fox endangers his friends and family by causing the farmers to destroy their environment and hunt them down, causing other creatures to be in peril as well. Many other cute animals such as mice, moles, badgers, rabbits, and beavers are all envisioned through the beautiful mind of Wes Anderson. The slickness and art put behind the unique stop-animation is both exhilarating and humbling to admire at the same time. The animation is very beautiful and has an almost real life portrait feel to it. It's like nothing you've ever seen before due to the beautiful English setting and cute creatures created by the wonderful production team. Wes Anderson's rich dialog is so charming that every viewer will be enthralled by. Children will adore the sweet humor and be blown away by the sweet animals they get to experience. Anderson does a daring job with the pen by making humor and a plot that can be analyzed and enjoyed entirely different by others. Kids and adults will enjoy the important message about how everyone is fantastic no matter what, but there are also things that only certain audiences will take into count. For instance, the marriage between Mr. and Mrs.Fox is examined in a way in which the trust and love between the two of them is studied thoroughly. It can get pretty deep! 'Fantastic Mr.Fox' is a visually inspiring work of art that when fought in the extra mile can execute beautiful themes and a widely rich story that is the stuff of cinematic history.",Null,2,5,9 July 2014
Son of Saul," Underwhelming, yet an insightful look on humanity.
","'Son of Saul' is a character study that simultaneously explores the nature of humankind using the Holocaust as a way to do so. It's a somewhat underwhelming portrayal of perhaps the most disturbing time in world history, yet does a good job of exploring the beauty of life in the darkest of places. While not the most technically strong film (the cinematography is almost all long-takes that aren't edited right), it moves fast and excels at its goals, having one of the most poignant and brilliantly executed endings of any movie in recent memory. Despite this, the rest of the film could use a giant edit and be more powerful and detailed in expressing its vision of humanity.",Null,0,0,27 June 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' is a delightfully original, sweet story that you'll deeply enjoy!
","Wes Anderson has created some of the most original and delightful pictures this decade. In 'Moonrise Kingdom' we see a small Massachusetts town with some of the most different characters. You have old guys telling you about the town, goo die-good boy scout troop leaders, annoying mothers, cute teenagers in love, and funny law men. Young lovers Sam and Suzy leave their old lives to live in 'Moonrise Kingdom' out in the wilderness. Sam is an avid boy scout who lives with foster parents and has trouble fitting into the weirdest society imaginable. Suzy is an unhappy girl with emotional problems. As their families learn about their rushed decision, they hire the entire town to look for them as many people including the police, boy scouts, and social services. Many big actors such as Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton give delightful performances that are naturally hilarious and unique. Wes Anderson's originality is so superb and creates a new type of storytelling that is creative, hilarious, and heartfelt. He ties in good themes of acceptance, love, and unity to make this sweet story have heart. The production design makes this story even more original that it's hard to explain. The New England town contains different architecture, beautiful nature, and goofy clothes that will make you pleased. Other elements such as music and directing make the film complete. When a creative story is written the film should be celebrated. Wes Anderson delivers a soulful and sweet story that will entertain you and help the art of cinema evolve its creative history.",Null,0,3,16 June 2014

","Change is apart of life. The word Flight indeed means to change.

Whip is a very skilled pilot who one day after using cocaine experiences a horrible plane crash due to extreme weather and mechanical issues. Whitaker miraculously saves many lives, leaving six dead sadly. After being called a hero on national news, his medical tests show he had drugs and alcohol in his system causing him to be involved in a court case. 'Flight; is a very entertaining film. John Gatins powerful screenplay shows a very interesting main character. The story shows Whip's hard personal life as he deals with drug addiction and alcoholism as well as past family issues with his wife and son. Many metaphors in the title of this film make Gatins' screenplay brilliant and Oscar- worthy. Denzel Washington gives one of the best performances of his career! He helps portray an excellent character with rich emotions and he captures the struggles in humanity. Zemmeckis directs 'Flight' excellently. His plane crash scene is one of the most intense scenes in film history. While viewing this film, ask yourself if you need to take 'Flight' and change. That's the message of the film, and it shows how doing the right thing and redeeming yourself can lead to a smooth flight with no turbulence as you reach your final destination.",Null,1,3,15 June 2014

War continues in middle earth as Mordor invades Gondor, making Rohan and the fellowship of the rings respond to defend the great city. The ring must be destroyed and leadership must be used in order to defend the world. Peter Jackson concludes this masterpiece perfectly! The direction this genius filmmaker uses provides every aspect of making a film the necessary quality it needs. The shots and cinematography capture the feeling and mood every scene has. We see spectacular settings around New Zealand that look so beautiful you'll really think they're from as different planet. Jackson shoots every scene beautifully even if the most terrifying and intense scenes are occurring, which shows the signs of a filmmaker not afraid to use charm in his work. The musical score is filled with slick tunes and mood/setting capturing beats. Every time a battle sequences occurs, the music makes it extra special. Now the editing really show you how evolved our cinematic talents are as humans. The film may length over 200 minutes, but the editors put this film together in a perfect order and added majestic talent to make the film as realistic as possible. The makeup, production and costume design are delightful and make the film realistic as well, but really capture the depth of each character.

Munich," Spielberg's most daring and entertaining masterpiece that brings up the issue of terrorism and the affect of violence.
","The Summer Olympics in West Germany in 1972 proved to be shocking and sadly triggering. 17 people died: 11 Jewish Olympic coaches or athletes, 5 Black September Palestinian terrorists, and one German police officer. The true violence and wrath occurred when the Jewish government lead a secret operation to hire four assassins to hunt and kill the Palestinians responsible for the deaths. Eric Bana plays Avner, a security agent who is requested to lead the operation. The four men encounter various attacks and end up assassinating many people responsible for the deaths. However, many other people become targeted through the mission due to their encounters...even the four Israeli assassins. Bana gives a flawless performance and portrays a scared and disturbed by violence type of hero who doesn't try to hard when holding his gun. He plays a realistic type of man and is not forced. The story of the Israeli assassin assignment was kept quiet for many years to avoid criticism, but later was revealed allowing legendary artist Steven Spielberg to create this powerhouse film. Every action sequence is not overdone or forced like most films these days, and has realistic violence that serves a purpose and shows a compelling time in history. Spectacular film making from every field brings this genius thriller to the world to show a compelling drama. The thrilling excitement provides an intelligent thriller that is eye-opening to show how Israel has dealt with terrorism for years. The true purpose of the film is to show how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict haunts the lives of many people, which is used through Eric Bana's intriguing character. Avner is so haunted by the violence he experiences that the conflict between the two groups devours him. Spielberg isn't showing how the Israeli's were innocent or how he Palestinians were cruel, instead he shows how each side fights over this land and how the conflict and war on terrorism will continue to affect the world for centuries.",Null,1,2,9 July 2014
The Matrix," 'The Matrix' is a visionary sci-fi classic that is entertaining and interesting to the pint that it drives you crazy!
","Science fiction can toy with our minds like a filter in our home that won't stop bleeping. 'The Matrix' is one of those complex and sometimes uncomprehending to some sci-fi thrillers that is so visually entertaining that you might get lost from it's original story. Pay attention to this! Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a computer programmer and hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a legendary computer hacker outlawed by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a devastating world where humanity has been controlled by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and energy and manipulate their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents. The plot is very science related but is a little confusing. That doesn't prevent pure cinematic entertainment from being replaced. The visual content 'The Matrix' contains is historical. Intense shootouts and bizarre production designs make this not only fun to watch, but more and more intriguing and interesting as the film carries on. This film is a Wachowski brothers film, as they wrote and directed it. The ideas they capture are very nerdy but none the less awesome. They allow an incredibly complex science film relate to some of the coolest action films that take place in normal time period by adding elements like shootouts and cheesy dialogue to make it popcorny and not all complex. The legendary costumes with the suits, classes and capes all make the film's setting unique and fun. The film can also bring up interesting ideas about protecting humanity. rising up against corruption and enjoying simple life-styles. The differences are very different in the Matrix world than in the real world, but we find many interesting similarities to our world that this electric and kinetic world has to offer.

Looper," 'Looper' loops up and down making it spectacular and disappointing.
","One of the main problems when rating a film is if the film contains a mixture of good and bad content. Filmmaker Rian Johnson creates an interesting action film starring rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe. Joe is a Looper. A Looper is an assassin who eliminate people from the future. How it works is criminals get the need to put a hit on someone and send them into the past to meet assassins called Looper's to do the dirty work. 'Looper' is set in 2074 that has an amazing setting. It has awesome transportation, beautiful women, unique guns, time travel and people who all live well. Joe is surprised one day when the mob wants to put a hit on him when he meets his future self (Bruce Willis) that he is hired to kill on the scene of his job. The mob basically wants to eliminate him from the future. 'Looper' contains a really unique and original story that has good scenes of action. In some scenes the action gets really silly and weird and just doesn't work. The first 30 minutes are amazing, however the middle of the film is really odd and doesn't go in the right direction. Rian Johnson chooses Joe to head to a farm to hide from the mob, where he meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her kid. Not a single actor besides Joseph Gordon-Levitt give good performances which causes the film to loose its drama. The main problem with 'Looper' is that it is a prime example of a film with wasted talent. It could have been amazing, and proves that it has some strong content, but doesn't do anything else strong. It loops around in a zig- zag in terms of how good it is, but overall is decent.",Null,0,1,15 June 2014

'Star Wars' isn't for everyone, but it's an experience everyone needs to fulfill. Not only did this change the way films were made and give way to modern-day classics, but it started a franchise that millions of people have in their hearts to this day. The blazing originality behind Lucas' mastery is profound in perhaps the coolest way. Space ships, giant bears, light-sabers, all the funky names, and groundbreaking visuals hold the veil over almost any other cinematic advancement. The franchise became a hit due to the uniqueness and originality that no one had every dreamed of. Ironically, it gave way to about six more films after the original trilogy was created. All with one idea to the next did George Lucas make history. A franchise that has been digitally remastered and controlled the theme of a museum isn't just a film. It's a continuous story that is still appreciated by people on every continent. Is it my favorite film franchise? Not even close.

50_50," Portraying the truthful path of defeating cancer in '50/50.'
","Being a cancer victim doesn't always mean being completely weak and hopeless, it could mean enjoying life even more. Some could realize that life could be over shortly and that being happy and enjoying friendships should be taken advantage of. '50/50' shows the brutally realistic timeline of a cancer patient named Adam, a sweet, calm and unadventurous young man played spectacularly by the rising star Joseph-Gordon Levitt who's doctor tells his he has a 50/50 chance of surviving a rare type of cancer. Adam's outgoing and sometimes overly rude best friend Kyle tries and help Adam through his path of a rare cancer that could be fatal. Kyle is played hilariously by Seth Rogen who gives a comedic relief into this true story. The two end up making the best of Adam's situation and become closer in the process. Adam also gets another benefit from his caner, which is a relationship with his therapist Katherine, a sweet Anna Kendrick. '50/50' is so easy to admire because of how well Will Reiser balances his story between the genies comedy, to some of the most heartfelt sequences in cinematic history. We really see the transformation of Adam's relationships with his current girlfriend, Kyle, Katherine and his parents because of his cancer. It's interesting that many assume that all cancer patients are so unhappy, hopeless and miserable, because there are plenty of patients like Adam who look on the bright side of his situation and try and enjoy life with the people in his life. The whole theme of 50/50 is that no matter what situation your in, there is a way out of it and having hope can defeat anything your faced with. We get to see how the cancer affects Adam both physically and emotionally as well, still portraying what having cancer does to you. With a slick balance between comedy and drama, Jonathan Levine directs this film very nicely, using a very realistic view of the world, which helps show the realistic pint of view of someone with cancer, telling us that it isn't so miserable and you can still enjoy life. 50/50 is an ode to life about how some days your going to loose and some days you'll be triumphant. Like Adam, you could be hit with something that can alter your life drastically, but know there is always a way out of it. You owe it to yourself to see '50/50' so you can enjoy a great story that can warm and inspire you.",Null,0,0,11 August 2014

A fantasized 'history' film about 300 Spartans who battled the evil Persians out of Greece. Gerard Butler is King Leonidas, the brave and kick-ass warrior who leads the Spartans into battle. Gerard Butler is awesome in this film with his extreme physiology and intense battle scenes that he leads throwing his spear at Persians and stabbing them with his sharp blade. The violence is stylized in a special way in which the blood is unique looking and doesn't look real at all. The cinematography is spectacular, causing '300' to show epic battle sequences like no other film. It's just impossible to take your eyes off of. Many epic battle sequences and elaborate production design allow you to view the picture with some historical relevance, but not too much that it begins similar to text out of a World Civilization text book. Zack Snyder is a pleaser, and leaves you with pure visual miracles and fun classic dialog. Whether it be Gerard Butler getting angry at a Persian for insulting Sparta and yelling 'THIS IS SPARTA' before kicking him down a wall, or warning his fellow men about the dangers that awaken them by crying out 'Spartans, tonight we dine in hell!' It's just awesome. Popcorn films have been an important part of cinema since the beginning of this majestic art-form, and they are especially relevant when they contain strong elements such as awesomeness and magnificent visual miracles.",Null,0,2,24 June 2014
Annihilation," Natalie Portman leads this disastrous yet entertaining sci-fi thriller.
","In what is perhaps one of the most sciencey sci-fil thrillers in recent memory, Natalie Portman leads a crew of all-female scientists into an iridescent space portal known as the Shimmer in order to discover what caused her husband to lose himself once he returned from it. At first, 'Annihilation' seemed like it would be an exciting adventure film that explored both a new world and a dynamic character arc. Unfortunately, director Alex Garland does a horrible job of actually exploring and explaining what The Shimmer is and what caused it. I had so many unanswered questions about this film and was left very confused.The poorly written pace of the film and story structure jumps all over the place, often making it difficult to identify what is a flashback and what is the present. Natalie Portman does her best to be an engaging action hero, yet her one-dimensional and boring character is tough to care for and root for. She's very unconvincing and seems to only want a paycheck out of this film.Visually, we get a more low-budget sci-fi from that can't compare to other blockbuster hits. Nothing arrests the audience or makes them at awe of what fills the screen. Director Alex Garland doesn't build up the tension at all, instead diving us right into this strange world and crafting no authentic drama or intensity. There is one notable scene that people will enjoy, but for the most part, the film doesn't have any energy or authenticity to it.Yet, despite much criticism, 'Annihilation' does a good job of exploring ideas. Perhaps it should have attached these ideas to its protagonist stringer, but the film carries weight to it and refuses to not explore anything interesting. Because of that, 'Annihilation' does hold the audience throughout, even if the ride is sloppy.",Null,1,2,10 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The science fiction franchise of a century.
","'Star Wars' is the kind of franchise that just won't be topped. No matter how much stronger the quality, there never will be a franchise that will gain so much international appreciation due to the fact that 'Star Wars' did something not even the great George Lucas thought possible. He created an international sensation that is still being hyped and built upon to this day. After the rebels have been brutally overpowered by the Empire on their newly established base, Luke Skywalker takes advanced Jedi training with Master Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader as part of his plan to capture Luke. This fictional world of planets and space creatures is still capturing the hearts of millions of people around the world. What George Lucas and his director Irvin Kershner do is strengthen an already good film (the first film in the saga, 'A New Hope') and continue a story without ruining the first or making it for the sake of money. It's a truly epic tale that to this day brings a smile on our faces due to the cutting-edge brilliance of a truly unique mind.",Null,2,3,14 August 2016
Aladdin," 'Aladdin' is one of those Disney films you'll definitely see at some point in your life.
","Differentiation between two lovers calls artists and storytellers internationally to express creativity in order to create something revolving around this topic. It's even happening in kids movies as Disney takes this story every American has heard of called 'Aladdin.' Aladdin is a young man in a Middle-Eastern or Moroccan environment who lives in poverty with his monkey Abu. The two steal in order to survive. Princess Jasmine gets tired of being forced to remain in the palace that overlooks the city, causing her to sneak out to the marketplace where she meets Aladdin and forms a friendship that may even be love. Under the orders of the evil Jafar, Aladdin is thrown in jail and becomes caught up in Jafar's plot to rule the land with the aid of a mysterious lamp. Legend has it that only a person who is a 'diamond in the rough' can retrieve the lamp from the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin might fit that description, but that's not enough to marry the princess, who must by law marry a prince. The plot is pretty sophisticated for a kids film. Children need to understand that this film is about how no matter how much wealth, power or ability you have or don't have, you can still achieve many great things. It also shows how anybody can fall in love no matter how different the two are. What's kind of interesting about 'Aladdin is how controversial it is due to being 'offensive' to Arab nations due to the dialogue in various songs and the production design of the film. In 1992 The United Sates was just getting off the Persian Gulf War, causing fear of the entire Middle East due to stereotypes and poor judgment. 'Aladdin' made controversy for portraying the Arab world as dark and cruel but it also showed the beauty of the Arab world and taught us how there is nothing to fear. With all the fine storytelling, were stuck with obnoxious singing and voice overs that never end. Every song is irritating and don't want to end. The plot is also pretty continuous and a bit long for Disney. It feels a lot longer than it is. On top of everything, there are just to many better animated films out there that are handled and directed better than 'Aladdin' and serve a better function.",Null,2,4,24 August 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," A musical take on career struggles.
","In life we all work hard to fulfill our career plans. But not like Llewyn Davis. Llewyn Davis is a heartbroken, unsuccessful folk-singer who works hard day to day to provide income for himself and provide music to people. He is very talented and is constantly unlucky. He impregnates a woman who is married to a rival in his music industry and wants an abortion, his old girlfriend who aborted their child left him, he has poor family relationships, and especially has career struggles. Joel and Ethan Cohen did an interesting film that centers around a failure in a time of success where many music stars such as Bob Dylan. What's interesting is that the plot can relate to anyone having career struggles in our time. The film making is very good, and it is done in an interesting way in which you just see how a struggling human being lives his life, and how working hard can't always get you good results.",Null,0,0,2 June 2014
Sin City," 'Sin City' is visually magnificent as it takes comic-book films to an entirely different level, and is pure awesomeness!
","Viusal masterpieces provide some of the best entertainment in history. Especially in film. In Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' you see a comic- book film that is completely original and extremely entertaining. 'Sin City' is a popular comic book series about a dark city that is manipulated by corruption, violence, and prostitution. There are dozens of characters, but the main characters are Hartigan, Marv, Nancy, Dwight, and Rourke. Hartigan is played by Bruce Willis and is an old cop who's mission is to save young Nancy Callahan from the evil child molester Rourke. Nancy is a stripper who's dream was to someday see Hartigan after saving her life. Marv is an ex-con who is out of control and is on a vengeful mission to find the killer of his loved Goldie, also a prostitute. Dwight is a bad-ass detective who gets into all sorts of trouble by protecting the streets of Sin City. As all the stories emerge you see tons of action like you can't believe and lots of other side characters that make the story extra rich. Robert Rodriguez directs this violent delight awesomely and guides every film aspect to give us a delightful guilty pleasure. The visual effects to make the film look like a motion comic-book are unique and cool and give style to this gritty story and portray a corrupt location like never before. The black and white style and occasional colored object like in 'Schindler's List' is very unique and provides this raw joy-ride the cinematic elements to make this one of the coolest films of all time.",Null,2,3,23 June 2014
Braveheart," History brought to life in a mesmerizing and brutal way!
","Fighting for freedom an't always go the peaceful Gandhi way. In order for true freedom in brutal times to come as peaceful as possible, revenge was essential. During the 13th century a war hero from Scotland named William Wallace experienced the cruelty and corruption the English enforced on the Scottish. Violence, corruption, rape, and rule were all used to take complete advantage over the Scottish until Wallace started a powerful rebellion to become a war hero and lead the Scottish to fight against the English in order to restore freedom and peace. William Wallce's incredible story is shown through the eyes of director Mel Gibson. Gibson envisioned the history of the tension between the two United Kingdom provinces beautifully, as he captures groundbreaking film-making to portray a biography and historical film like no other film has ever gone. Every shot is so intriguing and relevant to the story. The film-making aspects such as cinematography, setting, costumes, and editing are superbly made to make the history come to life. The filming of the Scottish highlands is magnificent and beautiful and really gets a feel of what warfare in the 12th century looked like. Historical films can often be dragged out and too biographical to tell a story as if it came from a history book. Writer Randall Wallace gives great background that is timed perfectly and developed the struggles and inspirations for William Wallace that leaves Mel Gibson to direct and portray William Wallace beautifully. He nails the Scottish accent! As for themes, freedom is a virtue that is a gift! Freedom is something that is a privileged to have and should be fought for if needed. Gibson and Wallace also get the message of fighting for anything. Not violently like William Wallace had to, but fighting in any way in order for good outcomes to be released. This is a classic film that is one of the best of the 90's, and is the greatest historical biography film ever directed.",Null,10,17,28 June 2014
Her," 'Her'' is the best film of 2013 that provides artistic vision on the world we live in.
","The best film of 2013 is a brilliantly constructed story from writer/director Spike Jonze about love, feelings, humanity, art, relationships and growth. 'Her' stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Thwombly, a lonely, depressed and wonderful writer who works for a writing company that writes love leaders for people who do not want to write them there selves. Theodore is perhaps one of the most likable film characters of all time. Theodore is struggling from a divorce with his soon to be ex-wife Catherine (Rooney Mara), who he met and fell in love with at a young age. The film is futuristic, which allows Theodore to buy an artificially intelligent operating system named Samantha (played excellently by the voice of Scarlet Johannson.) Theodore soon falls in love with Samantha as they talk about feelings and love, enjoy each others company, experience nature, art, sex and live life the way they want to. Spike Jonze's screenplay is beautifully crafted that contains an interesting title that requires the viewer to think about the meaning. He expresses beautiful themes and lovable characters that are very natural. His directing is beautiful and captures the future in a creative way. The way people interact with each other in different forms of relationships are shown in many different and eye- opening ways. We see a new type of love relationship, a friendship between opposite genders, sweet flashbacks from a marriage and simple conversations between ordinary people encountering each other. The theme of growing is portrayed through Theodore and Samantha due to Theodore being lonely and unhappy with his life and Samantha being vulnerable to experiencing the world and growing out of that state. We see many different experiences that all people can go through and some are done through a computer system which shows how we can learn from other material and encounter relationships and experiences to help us. 'Her' sure brings much to the table. The acting is well done, but its Spike Jonze's characters that are the strongest. The film arts such as production design,cinematography and music make the film extra special by adding beauty and awe to the motion picture. Cut little aspects in 'Her' such as unique clothing and advanced technology give this film a vision of the future, which relates to the themes of growth and the future of the characters.'Her' makes the audience feel for its characters and admire Spike Jonze's magnificent screenplay if they give some time to think about the themes and messages. Overall, 'Her' is the best film of 2013 and will stick with you forever.",Null,0,3,2 June 2014

","Jamal Malik is a poor child from the slums of Mumbai, India who enters India's most acclaimed game-show 'who wants to be a millionaire?' With no proper education, Jamal is extremely close to winning a large amount of rupees and becoming famous to India. How did he do it? Every question that Jamal is asked has some significance in his complex life that will bring him closer to his true love that he met at a young age. From meeting celebrities, to being kidnapped, to living in poverty, the gravity of Jamal's life that still continues while being on the show is experienced in a shocking and unique way. Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is an exhilarating motion picture that contains all the beauty and strength needed to make a truly feel-good film. Boyle takes you into the life of one person and shows the amazing things he has to cope with. The love story between he and his old lover Latika is extremely beautiful and proves that romance in cinema can still be moving. The flash-backs are put in perfectly to make a film that has order and class in which we can see a spiraling story come back to two different times. Danny Boyle's gorgeous and sometimes directing takes you into the heart of India in a very blatant but elusive way to show you a devastating setting that still has a touch of beauty due to the directing touches Danny Boyle does to assure a beautiful story. The film arts that are put into making such a beautiful picture are ravenous to touch the audience. The music, editing, cinematography, and production make the culture and love come to life in a vibrant way that create such an audience pleaser. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is by far one of the most vivid and feel-good audience pleasers that cinema has to offer, and you''l experience a modern classic that will leave you cheering.",Null,1,5,10 July 2014

","What a lovely day. George Miller reinvents his 'Mad Max' trilogy in 'Fury Road,' a magnificent work of cinema dazzled in mind-blowing visual effects and cinematic techniques. 'Mad Max:Fury Road' is the kind of movie you don't want to end. Not only is it ridiculously entertaining, but it also posses elements of a well made and well thought out masterpiece. We pick up with Tom Hardy on his acting career roller-coaster playing Max, a drifter who comes across Furiosa, a woman who rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners. Pretty crazy huh? Charlize does spectacularly awesome work as Furiosa, kicking ass throughout the film next to the muscular and quiet Tom Hardy. Their performance aren't the key to this roller-coaster film. The endless car chases, massive explosions, and dazzling editing and cinematography blend this crazy ride of a film into one spectacular work of art that belongs in the lists of the top ten greatest movies of all time.

Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson returns to his directing skills in a deeply inspiring war epic.
","Desmond Doss is an American hero that I wish I had heard of before seeing 'Hacksaw Ridge.' This deeply brave and loving patriot was a true Christian who believed in non-violence, therefore refusing to even touch a weapon during WW II, instead using his medical skills to help save wounded soldiers during battle. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a superbly crafted war epic with intense direction from Mel Gibson who crafts powerfully realistic war battles that rival any war film ever made besides maybe 'Saving Private Ryan.' The editing and visual effects of these disturbing spectacles in tremendous. Andrew Garfield, while clearly giving it his best in the lead performance, felt a little forced to me. His southern accent was a little too much and I feel that maybe he wasn't the right choice to lead this film. Despite this, he gives a decent performance and leads the film well. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is powerful in these sense that it's deeply inspiring and shines a light on one of the few beautiful stories during the brutal war on Japanese soil. This is a terrific American film about a hero who doesn't get enough recognition as he deserves in the American public life.",Null,1,1,16 May 2018

Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen on 'Game of Thrones) plays a small-town girl who ends up care-taking for a paralyzed young man. yes, they fall in love. Yes, their love is tested. Don't be fooled. This film is authentic in the sense that you care about the outcome of this couple, you root for them. There's lost of sweet and tender moments that make 'Me Before You' work well.

Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a Roman general betrayed with his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son, who he to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge. This is an epic that fancies the costumes and sets more than the actual story, but excels in entertainment and style. Russell Crowe gives a strong performance, while Ridley Scott directs the film in a typical style that allows us to soak up the time period and absorb the action and bloodshed in front of us.

A troubled teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plagued by visions of a large bunny rabbit that manipulate him to commit a series of crimes, after narrowly escaping a bizarre accident. This creepy, original, bizarre, wondrous, stylish, and magnificent work of art will have you guessing the entire time, except when director Richard Kelly throws a scene so arresting that it's impossible to think. The haunting score and dysfunctional suburban life penetrate our thoughts like a nightmare, while the stylish camera-work and overwhelming amount of animals play with your rational. Richard Kelly uses realistic science to blend into ordinary life and takes you on a cinematic adventure like no other. I really had no idea what was going on. I thought I did, but once I looked up the true meaning beyond the film, I was amazed at the brilliance beyond Richard Kelly's fantastic ideas and direction. Jake Gyllenhaal brings this unique story to life with a masterful performance that takes young acting to a whole new level. This film takes work. It might help to learn about tangent universes, chronological orders, living receivers, manipulated dead and living, and other scientific elements relating to these. These are what the plot is shaped from. The whole idea of human relations, destinies, and chance events are questioned throughout the film. It may be hard to understand all this due to being distracted from all the magnificent film work that is thrown at you constantly.

So many men like this real-life hero have gone through the same emotional and psychical torture from the Civil War to the Iraq War. Oliver Stone raises important political questions about how we treat our veterans, but more importantly, he has us wonder if serving our country with our corrupt government is worth fighting for. With many philosophical questions regarding America and war, Oliver Stone crafts his best film that is an American classic. Tom Cruise gives his strongest and most heartbreaking performance, nailing every detail regarding his complex and demanding role.

The dynamic duo of filmmaking that is screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher is a perfect collaboration that blends gifted nonfiction storytelling with artistic direction to give excitement and creativity in every scene. Fincher uses dark lighting, slick editing, and a beautiful musical score to deliver a brilliant story from the keyboard of Aaron Sorkin.

Macbeth," Shakespeare's classic tale hits the big screen.
","What makes 'Macbeth' such a legendary story isn't due to its creepy and engrossing story line that takes its characters through a thunderstorm of chaos, but rather what it did originally, that is exploiting pride and power and what it does to the mind. Shakespeare's epic tragedy hits the big screen from director Justin Kurzel in a somewhat disappointing fashion. Kurzel hits the mark with the production and costume design, setting up ancient Scotland in fantastic uniform. What Kurzel fails to do is adapt it fully enough. Unless you didn't graduate from high school English, the story is relatively iconic. Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself, leading to war and blood. Michael Fassbender, one of the hottest rising stars as Macbeth, and French actress Marion Cotillard as his mischievous wife, give great performances who were born for these roles. The only issue 'Macbeth' has is that the writing is too similar to the playwright. In fact, it is nearly word for word what Shakespeare originally wrote centuries ago. What this does it make it hard to fully understand and hear what's occurring on screen, tending to lose track of what the story symbolizes and take away the entertainment value from the film. Despite this problem, 'Macbeth' is a triumph of production and surely the strongest screen adaptation of the play to date.",Null,1,1,20 July 2016

Goodfellas," 'Goodfellas' is a perfect film that is an absolute classic from legendary film artist Martin Scorsese.
","Calling a film 'perfect' is a strong statement. The reasons why 'Goodfellas' is indeed a perfect film are infinitive. 'Goodfellas' is a crime classic about the New York mob in the 1950's-80's. The story is focused on mobster Henry Hill, who wanted to be a gangster since a young age. He adored their lifestyle of power, fame, and wealth, and was very impressionable, which lead him to partially succeed in the crime world. Henry Hill is portrayed wonderfully by Ray Liotta. Henry goes on to meet Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro's best performance)and Tommy De Vito (the best mob performance of all time by Joe Pesci.) The three men or 'Goodfellas' lived a life of crime by stealing, killing, and loosing throughout their lives. The men encounter various criminals who are also full of violence and greed, which causes tension and acquaintances throughout this legendary story. Martin Scorsese's is perhaps the greatest filmmaker of all time, and 'Goodfellas is by far his greatest film. Every camera shot and film element are so intriguing and shot elaborately to portray the mafia lifestyle like no other artist has, that's top offed with an awesome soundtrack with some of the greatest mob hits. Scorsese also wrote this spectacular story that contains rich and realistic dialog, mostly coming from actor Joe Pesci. Pesci delivers a performance of a chilling, funny, and brutal mobster named Tommy De Vito, who's dialog is the stuff of cinematic history. De Niro portrays a gangster beautifully, not only looking and sounding the part, but making history come to life in every scene. 'Goodfellas' takes us in a world manipulated by greed and violence, and is the ultimate story of getting into trouble due to first impressions and fantasy, as well as loosing everything for power. Every cinematic element is a great representation of 1990's film making due to its inspiring shots and editing that have inspired many filmmakers to use as guidance in making their films. Crime films are by far some of the greatest ever produced, but 'Goodfellas' stands strong upon them, and is by far the greatest mob film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made.",Null,0,2,27 June 2014

To be fair, DiCaprio is not bad in the film. It's director Baz Luhrman who ruins this story, generating an ugly, flashy, loud, obnoxious and stale style that demolishes the entire film. Carrey , one of the most annoying actors around, is at her peak in trying to make audiences dislike yet another one of her characters. She has no chemistry with DiCaprio and is unfit for this film.

When Margaret, a Canadian, faces deportation for an expired visa, she hatches a scheme to marry Andrew - he agrees if she'll promise a promotion. A skeptical INS agent vows to test the couple about each other the next Monday. Andrew had plans to fly home that weekend for his grandma's 90th, so Margaret goes with him - to Sitka, Alaska - where mom, dad, and grams await. I must say, for a romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock, the plot is a bit complex. Most of these films just waddle down into a desire for happiness and sex jokes, but 'The Proposal' does more than that. It has its moments of fun and laughs, but mostly returns to the boring clichés that make us hate romantic comedies. Too bad, 'The Proposal' was on to something. Sandra Bullock played the uptight professional role well, but struggled coming out of her shell as an actress and being funny. Ryan Reynolds' character could have been played by anyone. He doesn't have the charm or the comedic talent that is needed to drive a comedy. With the typical frustrating falling apart moments and mayhem, 'The Proposal' looses its heart that we all were waiting for.

Jurassic Park," Classic dinosaur storytelling that is scary as you can get!
","Dinosaurs were some of the most magnificent creatures to roam the Earth, and lived during the Mesozoic era about 65-230 million years ago. With the power of cinema these magnificent beasts can still live on and please audiences for centuries. Jurassic Park is the story of three doctors who study at a theme park that is home to cloned dinosaurs. Technically not every species is from the Jurassic era. You have some Cretaceous and Triassic cold-blooded buddies running around as well. When the doctors continue their study on the life of the creatures, a strong power-outage is caused due to weather, and this causes many creatures to roam free outside of their controlled boundaries. And yes this means Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptors too, which causes intense horror scenes involving being eye to eye, hiding, and chased for food. The film has very realistic dinosaurs, and for 1993, the effects are miraculous. It would be very difficult for a special effects team to create visually re-mastered dinosaurs that match the iconic physiology of the ones Steven Spielberg and his team have created. Every dinosaur is focused on in different ways. Some show the beauty these creatures have, others show the power and terror they are capable of causing. The horror isn't overdone or disturbing at all, which is why the scenes are scary! The shock value and mystery Spielberg adds is similar to how he did the shark in 'Jaws.' He makes the creatures suspicious and elusive before popping out and scaring the heck out of us. The classic scenes in which the T-Rex chases the car before stopping his way in causing the glass of water to shake and attacking the car like it was a raw piece of meat are cinematic beauty. Spielberg has created a film full of science, wonder, visual beauty, and terror that is made in wondrous ways technically, and will provide pure entertainment for centuries.",Null,2,2,28 June 2014

","Blockbusters are only good once in a while.

During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. How cliché is that? Not to mention its based off of a bestselling novel. 'The Martian' is poorly executed by old-time director Ridley Scott, who hasn't achieved anything much in his career in a while. He guides his effects crew to do just the bare minimum, and instructs his production team to barely make us feel on mars. Shot in a big studio, this film fails at every level to bring any ingenuity to the screen.

The Fighter," Not your typical boxing film!
","Many sports films revolve around boxing and the challenges the leading actor faces. David O Russell's 'The Fighter' is a powerful boxing film that develops all its fighting characters and gives a strong message about persistence. Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, the real-life mid 1980's boxer from the streets of Boston who worked his way to earn special titles in the boxing world. Wahlberg really isn't the lead character focused on. Christian Bale gives an exhilarating performance as Micky's brother Dicky. Bale nails the Boston accent and plays a dirty and somewhat dirt-bag of a character.

The Godfather," Francis Ford Coppola brings an empire of crime to life in classic fashion.
","Everyone at some point will see 'The Godfather' unless they live under a rock. This classic beginning of an epic trilogy beholds a crime story unlike any other for one reason: it doesn't view the crimes as crimes. Francis Ford Coppola shows the business end behind the Italian mafia after WW II. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) passes his organized crime dynasty to to his reluctant son Michael (Al Pacino) after tensions rise between his fellow Mafia families. This epic reflects a struggle between a family caught up in crime and portrays the consequences that erupt due to such activity. Coppola engages audiences with the settings he portrays with wonderful music and camera work that helps tension rise and lets viewers experience the characters' emotions. Unlike many other films made in the seventies, 'The Godfather' gets its production value right. It has fantastic costumes and sets that allow you to engage in the characters' conflicts. But what this film does best is show the devastation of a family enlisted in a horrible business that can prove fatal. It makes you rethink everything you know about mafia and show a humanized version of real people who, due to their family, end up doing bad things. This isn't a film about bad people. It's a film about people doing bad things, all in the name of business.",Null,1,1,6 June 2016
