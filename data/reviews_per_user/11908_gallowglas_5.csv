Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," One more proof that IMDBs voting system is utterly useless...
","Having seen a few trailers for GoS, I actually wrote it off. Ritchie's first Holmes movie was okay, but not great. Still, I like his style plus i like Downey Jr., Law and Rapace. So, when I suddenly read many positive reviews from fellow moviegoers on IMDb I made a grave error: I took them for real. And bought the DVD. I should have known, that reviewers, that rave for one movie (but have, according to their history, never seen another) are most likely plants: pr-agencies, marketing- and one-review-industrial-accounts.I paid dearly.What's good about this movie? The direction is solid - even though it is the fourth (or fifth?) remake of 'Lock, stock...'. I'd wish that Ritchie would eventually broaden his visual and narrative style. Acting is okay. Visuals are okay.So - what's wrong? Pretty much everything else. But the main problem is: This movie has no plot, no script no story. The characterizations - if any - are ludicrous. The story arc is incoherent. Worst of all: It is plain boring. I could have switched off anywhere in the movie and would not have missed a thing. Alas: the dog fell asleep on the remote.It's a shame, that by now almost every new movie get's a terrific rating on IMDb instantly. Sure: it's an Amazon company and Amazon want's to sell. But is it really necessary to hype such trash? Can't we keep at least some decency? Myself, I have started to regard a good rating on IMDb more as a threat rather than a recommendation...",1,9,16,4 October 2012
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Well... nice CGI
","What to say? I truly expected more. Trying to please both adult and children audiences, I am afraid that Disney fell flat in between.Well, actually I cannot speak for the six-years-olds: They might love it and I wouldn't know, but then again the whole movie is so slowly paced that your average hyperactive kid is bound to loose track between two cuts. That's Narnia's biggest problem: It's plain boring. You just never get involved.I appreciate the effort Disney made to give more depth to the story: Peter's got more doubts about doing the right thing, Edmund is more of a rebel but simply a spoiled kid. Problem is though: kids (for whom Lewis wrote his book) won't know the difference while adults, who (like me) might appreciate a little more character development, may find many issues unresolved. There are movies that appeal to both young and old, but Narnia certainly does not join the fray.One more thing: 'Nice CGI' refers to the animals, whose animation is sometimes short of outstanding. On the other hand there are just too many obvious computer graphics. Every other minute you get the impression of watching a video game. This might be due to somebody thinking that an impressive lion's fur carries a movie farther than a realistic scenery. Well, you can't spend one buck twice...All in all, I don't know for whom this film was made (certainly not for me) and I can find no excuse to recommend it.",4,12,22,3 January 2006
We Were Soldiers," Supposed to be authentic?
","Mainly, this movie tries heavily to cash in on American patriotism. If you're into John Wayne like heroism and macho militarism this is definitely your flick. Should you expect a critical and reflective war movie  be prepared.WWS is based on Moore's and Galloway's account of the Ia Drang battle, a book that is definitely worth a read. The movie is not true to the book, though. The script takes the main storyline, cannibalizes it by shuffling around some historical facts and anecdotes, pumps it up with clichés and macho gestures and adds some dramatic fiction for good measure including an ending, that manages to even depict the Americans as some sort of winners. This can hardly be called accurate. Then again, surely there even are people who regard Cecil B. DeMille's Ten Commandments as an authentic depiction of the Old Testament.The cinematography furthers the fictionalization of the battle by use of overly dramatized and effect loaded images. Still, the photography and the effects are good. Acting is mostly okay, apart from Gibsons rendition of Moore, which at times is almost hilariously grim and heroic.All in all a solid war-action flick with some but loose ties to a true story  there are better ones. 2/10 for failed effort.",2,14,33,9 January 2005
The Village," What a mess of a story.
","And once again M. Night Shayamalan delivers a 'tale with a twist'. And once again the 'twist' is not exactly a twist but a violation or even contradiction of the before told story. No matter how fictitious a story may be, it has to have its own set of rules and its own logic that must not be discarded lest the story get's inconsequential - which is exactly what happens to 'The Village'. Speaking of plot holes would seem unfair to other bad scripts that at least struggle to build a plot around the holes. 'The Village' leaves you with the holes only. Ironically, many audiences seem too believe that if they didn't spot the 'twist' it must have been very clever - as opposed to being plain stupid.This said, the acting, apart from maybe the most unrealistic depiction of a blind person ever witnessed, ranges from mediocre to solid performances. The cinematography is atmospheric and befits the scenery. The beautiful images that always suggest something hidden below the quiet surface are what mostly carries the movie.After all the movie is okay to watch if you allow for the lame excuse for a story and drop your expectations. 5/10",5,0,0,23 November 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Bloated and simply boring
","Just saw 'The Hobbit' in 2D and standard 24 fps. There is some good to be said about this movie: Many set-designs and landscape shots are quite beautiful (in case you missed the same set-designs and landscape shots in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy)... Alas, this does not a great movie make! In terms of plotting, pacing or character development 'The Hobbit' falls unbelievably short. Actually this movie is like watching six or eight fantasy video game trailers in sequence. Jackson put much effort in creating 3D-worthy graphics but none in a story worthy to be told. The additions to Tolkien's Book feel contrived and unnecessary, bordering on ridiculous.The movies action has neither point nor focus. Especially (but not exclusively) the battle scenes feel drawn out and overlong. During the screening I saw, two people in my row actually fell asleep during the movie, proving that action for it's own sake is simply... tiring.Jacksons interpretation of The Lord Of The Rings was partly faithful as well as partly very far from the original source. Either way, one had the impression, that Jackson was driven to tell (his version of) this story. With The Hobbit, you get the expression that Jackson's only drive is to cash in. A pity.I won't say, that I'll avoid the coming parts two and three - I'll definitely wait for the budget DVD/Blu-Ray though.",1,47,89,27 December 2012
