Captain Phillips," Great movie
","(Note: There are two very slight 'spoilers' herein but not at all able to spoil your enjoyment of the film, maybe just the opposite).I just don't get it why in the IMDb.com quotes from the movie they missed the best one:CAPTAIN to Pirate: 'Kenny, what do we have in the safe?...Thirty thousand dollars? ... In the safe we have thirty thousand dollars. It's yours.'PIRATE: 'Thirty thousand dollars? What am I? Do I look like a beggar?!'When you watch the movie you will know why this is the best quote.In summary: they rarely make movies of quality like this anymore. Fast paced, well acted (impressive work by the Somali actors!), good camera work, no unnecessary F-words, not one. It is over two hours but you will not notice how the time has passed. This is not some cheesy Hollywoodish made up hostage movie. It is based on a true story. The film is impartial, yet kind, in telling a story where one can even feel empathy for the pirates, the human side of their misery bringing misery to others by attacking ships and their crews. Yet, not for a second the over-the-top, annoying preachy leftism, so typical for Hollywood flicks.Another question that I kept not finding an answer to was why are these crews unarmed when they cruise in such dangerous waters? Could not come up with any really reasonable answer. Highly recommend it. You will not be sorry to have watched this movie.",9,1,5,30 November 2013
The Impossible," Brilliant, moving, edge-of-your-seat drama
","One of the best movies I have seen. Gripping, clear, unpretentious story telling.One of those films you can watch again. Some of the scenes are heart wrenching. Others are just painful to watch and make you cringe.There are scenes that are so shockingly heart-warming in the midst of chaos, suffering, disaster and death that you would not be able to hold back your tears.Do not pay attention to the conceited blowhard nay-say reviewers and racially sensitive political activists trying to question the value and the impact of the movie. This film will shake you and will leave you with deep sense of satisfaction.I will also mention he absolutely brilliant acting, and cinematography.",10,2,4,2 January 2017
Jarhead," Impossible to watch
","Years ago I started watching this movie. Couldn't finish it as it was so brutally cynical, hopeless and pretentious. Just stopped in the middle or before then.Recently I started watching it again. Obviously I had erased from my mind the memories of the self-gratifying obscenities, the documentary supposed angle of it, the gross, graphic, and unnecessary sexual content, and all the rest of the F-wording.Well, same again. I remembered that I had watched this movie when I realized that I am going to quit watching, so dull and pretentious it seemed to me with all the nonsense that made it on the director's camera and in front of the weary eye of the viewer. That's when I realized: 'Ah! Now I remember this movie! I could not keep on watching the flick so I quit!' Then I quit again.And decided to write a review to explain this phenomenon. How frustrating a movie has to be to remember it only by the fact that you had not been able to bear to watch it in the first place?There is one good point to it. At least these characters did not talk about their hemorrhoids. Well, I am not 100 per cent sure as I did not finish it. Maybe they did in the second half which I did not watch?",1,9,16,18 December 2016
The Exorcist," Ridiculously overrated
","It is a scary flick alright - it registers that there is evil, it is personal, and it has supernatural powers. The movie properly shows the contemporary ridiculously exaggerated trust in medicine and 'science' to the extent of being absolutely foolish about the reality of the spiritual world. That's the first half of the second star. However, if you will be addressing supernatural powers of evil you must put God in the picture as well, and in his true light - the Almighty Ruler who reigns over evil and the devil through the Name of His Son and the work of His ministers. Not in this flick.Instead the whole story is told from a perspective that misrepresents the New Testament treatment of unclean spirits and the devil. Evil wins in the end; the deliverance ministry (the exorcism) contains a lot of relevant aspects of the ways this prayer is done, and how demons behave, but contains also a lot of misrepresentations. Was this the director's take on the Catholic church or just simply he did not know there was a better way -- that will remain a secret.The acting is believable, that's the other half of the second star.I will quote David Wilkerson, a preacher who wrote in a book of his in 1973, the year this sorry production was released: 'The movie The Exorcist was an attempt of satanic forces to ridicule and humiliate everything related to the blood of Christ.' He got that right. So watch it and fill yourself with fear and demonic deception (as if it is lacking from the rest of today's brainless entertainment).",2,4,12,16 March 2014
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Blunder
","This movie is a disaster. Renaming it to 'Tropic Blunder' may hurt the ego of its producers but would be truer to what the audiences should expect. The film is gory and disrespectful of war veterans and people who have risked their lives in the Vietnam war or in any war. Gore and blood are enmeshed together with cynicism and insensitivity which we are to take as some deep form of artistic reflection on the evils of war and violence. Ben Stiller proves yet again that while he can be a good comedian when someone else directs him he does not live up to the job of directing. The film is filled with cursing, profanity, and sheer stupidity to the point of becoming unbearable. However, we must admit that there are several funny and witty lines in the disastrous dialog. One of those rare moments is when, Robert Downy Jr.'s character, who is a white man pretending to be black, gets into an exchange with the other African American in the group about the phrase 'you people.' Downey Jr.'s acting is still impressive, even in the midst of poor plot and writing. Besides these 'pearls', which are few and far between, the flick is simply bad, bad, bad. And it is not funny. I would not let even my dog watch it.",1,10,20,17 May 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Better than James Bond
","Great film. The plot makes sense, the dialog is real and funny, the characters are believable even though their exploits are not. Isn't this a good recipe for a two-hour action entertainment? The stunts are amazing especially the one of Tom Cruise cruising along the glass windows of the tallest building in the world. There are some really funny lines and when hit the characters actually hurt (unlike Angelina Jolie movies where she is wounded but remains unscathed even when hundreds of elite forces attack her). Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is over two hours of action that will keep you at the end of your seat, biting your nails. If Tom Cruise was trying to compete with, let's say, the Bond franchise, his Ethan Hunt wins by far.Funny, Cruise's Russian is better than the one of his Russian friend in the movie, acted by a Serbian actor.",9,8,13,7 January 2012
It Follows," Idiotic
","It follows you right here. The stupidity and sickness of this flick follows you wherever you go. The flick is insane. Just nuts. Complete bananas. This an inexplicable, inessential nonsense. If you decide to force yourself to get engrossed in the improbable story you will come across some scary moments. But the sick and perverted scenes readily compensate for any thrill by leaving you unnecessarily disgusted. Teenage debauchery combined with sick fantasies and a senseless, moronic plot. If boredom and retardation could be combined in a perfect combination this sorry flick is the standard. Get ready to waste your time and money. Or not, if you follow my advice: avoid at all cost. I want my money back and I am sorry for each and every cent spent to support this loser project.",1,40,76,27 December 2015
Django Unchained," Smell a rat?
","In his previous film 'Inglorious Basterds' Tarantino presents two worthy scenes - the one with the Nazi officer in the French farmer's house, and the one in the bar where the British and American spies are in German uniforms talking to a suspicious SS German officer and a shootout follows.In the first mentioned scene the Nazi officer explains how one has to think like a rat in order to find 'rats.' The offensive reference is to Jewish families trying to escape Nazi extermination (whom the Nazi officer chases in the movie).In that scene the Nazi officer, maybe inadvertently, describes himself as a rat, trying to play wise guy. So does Tarantino.'Django' is actually proof that Tarantino is a talented Hollywood 'rat' that feeds on popular trends packaged in politically correct radicalism. The mixture is gratuitous violence, popular concepts of 'just revenge' and butchering of history and the importance of historical fact. Jews killing Nazis in 'Inglorious...' Black man killing whites in 'Django...' Tarantino is a torture-porn specialist, hiding behind badly disguised ridicule of the magnitude of human suffering in historical dramas like the Holocaust or the issue of slavery in America. One just has to remember his 'Hostel' achievements and it all comes home.The Tarantinonites can knock themselves out with Django - another trashy movie with a spice of genius in it, to excite the perverted tastes of Hollywood. Evil genius. That smells like a rat to me.",1,180,340,28 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Went way too long, too pretentious
","Slow paced film, a wanna-be hybrid of Euro and American cinematography. The acting is believable to a certain extent and the motivation of the characters seems to be supported by the plot and their character development, with some exceptions. The female character is unlikely to be so savvy at her research abilities at such a young age. The build up of the 'guardian' of the female character is flat and merely designed for the audience to hate him so that all feel relieved when 'he gets what he deserves.' No sense of relief for the viewer at that scene though, only disgust at the lowly and despicable scene of violence. The female is disproportionately and unbelievably powerful in solving the problems of the main protagonist - both intellectually and physically. Along those lines the movie follows the Hollywood trend of the last years 'females rule' - smart, independent women in their early 20s, who fix the mishaps of sturdy, well framed, but somewhat stupid men, and who leave to the lady to get what she wants. The only difference is that the woman in the Swedish flick is not a PhD, but a rebel with a tattoo the size of her body. The plot does develop in a logical sequence and has some twist and turns. However, they come way too slow to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat. The story telling is OK with the exception of when the story moves to other, far-off locations. There is no transition or any scenes to show that the protagonist goes to a foreign country, for example. Unless you're a fanatical fan of the Euro 'cinema' -- not worthy the long two and a half hours.",2,15,46,4 October 2009
Avatar," Expensive and preachy freak show
","If special effects were the essence of movie-making, Cameron's fantasy 'Avatar' might have been a film of value. However, this movie amazes the viewer with the complete lack of original ideas in its story-telling. We have almost half a billion dollars spent on a cheesy story, padded with political correctness and an annoying imposition of some mixture of neo-paganism, spiritualist environmentalism and Wicca-goddess worship. The preaching of the weird religious beliefs is in your face and relentless: besides the time spent on rituals and chanting, we even have a conversion-scene of a hard scientist to the religion of the planet's natives. And these 'Navi' beliefs are good-old jungle 'boogie' mixed up with some mother-earth nonsense.Freakshow. The natives of the planet are 'humanoid' yet not exactly human. Besides 'taking you into another world', the choice of the 'race' for the natives is quite offensive. They are a bigger version of humans with some elf-like features, vampire fangs, and the facial expressions of an ant-eater. We should not forget the proverbial tail – evolution has taken its own turn on the planet. The special visuals may make entering this world of Cameron's unobtrusive but the sense of mixing these creatures with humans is still unnerving to the viewer. And let's not forget – the color blue for the skin is only a little step away from the usual green-gray color of aliens.The bad guys are the white males of military discipline and corporate greed. The good guys are the tribal planetary humanoid underdogs, and the breakaway humans sympathizing with the native's cause. The story telling is good as it follows the classical secrets of the trade. But the sheer length of it and the indulgence in special visuals makes it rather boring and lacking depth.'Borrowing' from other movies is heavy. In it we sense the strain of Cameron's imagination to overcome its boundaries, set by his own liking, experience and pretensions. The film is a mixture which borrows from 'The Matrix' (entering another world through a heavily-wired coffin), 'Apocalypto' (kill the beast but apologize – after all, it is your brother), Count Dracula (the native's have protruding fangs), 'Star Wars' (much shooting on a large scale in a strange planetary environment); 'The Glimmer Man', with Steven Segal (Bad, bad company, digging for treasure under my house!); 'Dances with Wolves' (I must become one of them.); 'Aliens' is also present (some of the animals open their nasty mouths in the same way as the main beast of that movie).This is an annoying and preachy film which, thanks to the enormous budget and mass-marketing, has become yet another blockbuster-symbol of human moral and intellectual limitations. Good movies are not just special effects wrapped up in New Age spirituality; but who am I to say that to the king of the world?",1,33,74,2 January 2010
Don't Breathe," What?
","I am not a film critic. I do not pretend to be. Nor do I care. When I watch a movie I expect either entertainment or an interesting original artistic view into the human soul or mankind's history. Bottom line: it has to be fun or memorable to be worth watching. Otherwise it is a waste of time at best and poison the mind at worst.This film is neither fun, nor memorable. It is a waste of time and a bitter pill.This film is a tortured effort for a deep drama-thriller and is a massive fail. Its attempt to create some form of a moral is ludicrous. People with unhinged and nasty fantasies wrote it and put it together. No offense to Alvarez but I have no respect for his work. While keeping up with the secrets of the trade the characters are unrealistic, unsympathetic, and the 'glamorous' ending, which contains a twist, does not make sense. You will be on the edge of your seat not because of suspense but because of disgust. As in all ridiculous contemporary films out of Hollywood, which makes 95% of them vulgar and deprave sexuality seems to be the way to entertain.There were no good guys -- all bunch of criminal scumbags. The chick's cheesy dream to go surfing in California with her sister is just too cliché and ridiculous. I just could not sympathize with any of the characters. Art is the ability to compress in two hours a story which will show you life and will make you ponder. Forget about it with this flick. You'll be happy that it's over and sorry that you started it.If you want to watch a film of high artistic quality, totally unpretentious, based on true events, watch Gruz 200 (Cargo 200, 2007, director Alexei Balabanov). No Hollywood gimmicks and an absolute horror. With absolutely minimalist use of gore. Watch and compare.",1,10,18,30 October 2016
Zombieland," Horrible zombiada
","Bad movie, bad taste, all is bad, bad, bad. The 'humor' is so grotesque, so inhumane, so over the top that in and of itself it is laughable that this flick is filed as 'Comedy.' Obviously big budget, the cinematography meets professional standards, but the content of the flick defeats any achievement in its movie-making quality per se.Harrelson, a good actor, delivers a good performance. But how good of a performance can it be if the whole film is so trashy? Zombies eating flesh and running maniacally in traffic, stores and climbing up the superman ride of Magic Mountain? Who pays to watch such movies in the first place? Obvisouly the idea of the producers was to appeal to the younger, undeveloped audience, deprived of parental control, whose peak of excitement is gory jokes and bathroom humor.One of the great lines is: 'Can't we drive for four hours like normal Americans!' What is a normal American, if not someone who would not be watching a terrifying flick like this? O, I almost forgot: there is romance. The romantic exchange between the main character and one of the teen females is entirely pathetic at the backdrop of the rest of the zombification galore.There is nothing good, no redeeming value in 'Zombieland.' Made in Zombieland, most likely by zombies, for a zombified audience.",1,41,90,7 November 2009
There Will Be Blood," Vivid and bleak
","I gave this film 2 for two reasons. One over the lowest grade of 1 for day Lewis' good effort at acting. The trade of directing and camera work is also impressive. However, the depiction of the 'religious people' is yet again simplistic annoyingly judgmental and plain nuts. That deserves the low grade.Just think of the maniacal Eli with his lust for church power and influence at his young age. The scene at the church where Eli cast out an evil spirit from an old woman is laughable. No true Christian community would stand the nonsense theatrical yelling of their preacher. Even more ridiculous is the slapping on the face of the kneeling Plainview in front of the whole church by Eli. This is not church this is torture. While being slapped Plainview yells 'I'm a sinner! I'm a sinner!' My goodness, aren't there any churches left so the director or writer would go and do their homework before they mesmerize their audience with insane depictions of a congregation on a Sunday morning? Well, they can blame it on the novelist, I guess.",2,2,7,15 April 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scumbag fest
","Over the top cursing, drug abuse, dirty talk, dirty act, lying, cheating people out of their money, homosexual and regular orgies, sexual masochism, public masturbation, drunkenness, over 700 profanities and blasphemy; adultery, child endangerment, reckless driving, incest, international money laundering, low level bribery, prostitution and occasional fleeting tender or dramatic moment. A scumbag's rise and fall and return to despicable life of greed, conceit and moral void. Scorsese and DiCaprio revel with the revelers in this flick to show...actually for an unknown reason. There is no moral reference point in the film, rather a neutral excitement about the cunning of the main character. There is not one good or sympathetic person depicted in this film. All are scumbags with no hope or desire for any form of redemption, remorse or a lasting human feeling. Very dark and depressing movie; actually misanthropic. The macabre disregard of any value is well hidden behind dark or foul humor and a blur of debauchery, crime and excessive luxury.The one thing that maybe deserves attention is the depiction of Belfort as a magnetic and captivating speaker, a preacher of mammon. He seemed to me more of a cult leader than a con man and a trader. Whoever made this movie hates man with a fiendish craftiness. Also evident in the very last scene.",2,51,97,21 January 2014
Iron Man," Great action-adventure film
","This is one of the best action-adventure movies I have seen. It delivers the goods - entertainment and fun, clean language (very important since I like to watch movies with my kids). There is all a film like this needs: dramatic, anxious, and passionate protagonist; subtle, implied romance (without the grossing out sex so common in other films), conversion of the hero from his former line of work, since he's seen things from a different angle (the moral growth); punishing the bad guys; well developed pace and sequence of scenes - good story-telling.Generally I don't like movies to tell me their directors' and/or writers' political or troubled philosophical views. Movies are generally for good fun-they have to be enjoyed by the viewer. The writing and the lines of the movie are crisp and intelligent. There is enough good humor, yet there is what to think about as well. The acting is also at the appropriate level: Robert Downy Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges deliver - they make us understand their characters and motivations. Good film for the whole family, with the exception of some of the violence and more intense scenes even for the younger. Hopefully the sequel will not take the usual turn to the darker side of movie-making.UPDATE ON IRON MAN II: Regarding the last sentence above -- unfortunately my hopes were in vain. Iron Man II is NOT a GOOD sequel. It did take the usual wrong turn to the darker side.",9,2,4,2 February 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Sick, disgusting and chaotic hellish nightmare. Mediocre too.
","As I endured the abysmal film, I was wondering about all the effort and time and money invested into this piece of ... what shall I say...!? I wonder what was the 'creative' process like for writers, directors, the poor actors and all the extras? What were they thinking as they took part in this grand mockery of a product of human creativity? They spent 30 mil on the stupid flick?I reached the following conclusion: to be part of the making of this...let's call it a 'horror flick'...one must be sick or insane. Or you can be part of it and then have deep trouble with you conscience, and your sleep.Here is the spoiler: Sigourney Weaver has a minor part in it. But gets an ax in the head. The alien finally won.I feel sorry for all the wretched souls who took part in this pornography and torture display of the derision of the human essence. The flick is a hellish nightmare made to have people pay to be visually and emotionally tortured by it. Disgusting. Obviously the devil made them do it it.",1,2,5,19 November 2012
