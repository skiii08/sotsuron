Scarface," Brilliant
","Not much more I have to say, simply one of the best gangster films ever made. Cements Al Pacino's legacy as a brilliant actor. Great performances from Robert Loggia as Frank Lopez, as well as a very young Michelle Pffifer and Steven Bauer. The amount of swear words on the film doesn't bother me either and the blood shed doesn't effect me either. Great amounts of research was put into the film by Olivier Stone and I think it shows. The final scene were Tony gets killed is legendary. Although maybe slightly unrealistic due to the amount of bullets he took yet he was still standing and shouting '' i'll take your bullets, c'mon!''. I loved the ending and I've watched this film no less than 25 times. Simply fantastic 10/10 in my book",10,0,1,7 November 2005
