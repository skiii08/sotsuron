Hereditary," Don't waste your time!
","I usually IMDb the movie rating before watching the movie. So when I searched this film and saw the high rating I thought it must be good!Boy, was I wrong.Such a confusing ending... had to google the end understand it.
A very play by numbers film that I wish I hadn't seen.
Not scary at all, just confusing parts. Should've had a better back story at the beginning then maybe it wouldn't have been so hard to follow. 
Found myself pausing it and asking my parter if he knew what was happening as I was lost... most of the time we both didn't have a clue as to the relevance of the scene!",2,1,3,28 September 2018
Beauty and the Beast," One of my favourite classic Disney movies
","This is the sort of film you can watch over and over. A nice easy watch. 
The sort of film you can watch with your family, partner, or alone! 
10/10 would recommend.",10,1,1,28 September 2018
Deadpool 2," Good sequal
","Good film as even if you don't get the movie references (like myself), it's still funny!",6,1,3,28 September 2018
Doctor Strange," More like doctor who
","While watching this film, it kept bringing back flashbacks of growing up childhood doctor who series, rather than a superhero movie. Dr strange has definetely got a different take on super hero as it's more of a never-verse than our universe, kind of hero",6,1,2,28 September 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Tried a bit too hard but still good
","The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was terrible! They try way too hard with the adding '80's music' and making it 'funny' that they comepletly forgot about the plot!
However, after watching it a second and third time, you sort of just get used to it for what it is. A comedy that doesn't have a good plot, but a lot of laughable scenes.
I was disappointed after the first viewing as I found the first movie amazing. But like I said, it's still worth a watch. A lot of friends who's opinions I've asked also thought the same as me, they tried to add too much music, lost track of the plot and made it more stupid funny.",8,0,0,28 September 2018
