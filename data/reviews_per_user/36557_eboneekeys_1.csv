Vertigo," Touring the 'Vertigo' locations
","I purchased the book, 'Alfred Hitchcock's San Francisco' and methodically toured every location seen in this film. This included the apartment building where 'Madeleine' lived with the shipping magnate. The hotel where 'Judy' resided is there as well, but now has been renamed.A trip to the Mission San Juan Bautista really blew my mind. This is where 'Madeleine' and 'Judy' died.After my tour, I viewed my DVD of this work again and this enriched the film for me. I really felt as if I were a part of it.Hitchcock also owned a farm south of San Francisco -- down the peninsula -- which he used to get away from the chaos of Hollywood. I checked the public records and found the location. The farm was sold decades ago, but I still felt Hitch's presence .. even if it were strictly imaginary.",Null,1,2,5 May 2006
