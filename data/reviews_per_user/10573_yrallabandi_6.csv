Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful and haunting, but too long.
","Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece. This cannot be debated. Roger Deakins is probably the best cinematographer working today. The shots themselves are beautiful, and the CGI is pretty great too. There is a scene almost midway through where the main character K (brought to life by Ryan Gosling in an awesome performance) where he has a threesome with his holographic girlfriend Joi and a replicant prostitute. This scene has incredible yet subtle effects, and after reading the behind the scenes, it's even more impressive. There's so much going on in this scene thematically, other than the sex scene.I also have to give major props to Denis Villeneuve for retaining the feel of the first film. This definitely feels like it's set in the same universe, yet it doesn't have the 'sequel feeling' that something like, Marvel, would have. This is its own movie. It doesn't try to set up another movie. That was great. I also have to commend the score. I'd listen to anything Hans Zimmer composes. Yep, I'm a fanboy. Sue me.And again, Ryan Gosling's performance was awesome. Yes, he is noted for staring intensely at something apparently, but he's someone to look out for. He acted really well. Especially in the scene with his memory of the toy horse and whether or not he's a human or replicant. I loved it. And it's pretty obvious at this point, but Harrison Ford was amazing too. The guy's a legend for a reason.That being said though, this movie has issues. Much like the first movie, it also feels slow. Makes sense, given we have so much to take in, but 2049 also feels a little bloated. It's quite long, at 2 hours and 43 minutes. Despite that, some things are not resolved. The replicant revolution doesn't have that big of a role in the movie. And we don't know much about the villain, Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). I feel like some of the wrong stuff was left in the editing room. And sadly, Denis has said there won't be a director's cut. I do also have an issue with another scene in the film, though this may be just me. When Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright) confronts K about something he did, I feel the scene ends a bit too quickly. It should have gone on longer, and more consequences should have arisen out of that. I feel some of this was edited out as well.Overall, I think this is a great film. I liked the first Blade Runner better, but this is nearly as good.",8,0,4,10 January 2018
12 Angry Men," A timeless classic.
","This is probably one of the greatest and most important movies ever made. While I still love The Dark Knight to bits, I believe 12 Angry Men should be above that on the IMDb top 250.Where do I start? The screenplay is one of, if not the best, ever written, and is probably the best aspect of the movie, even above the incredible acting, which I'll get to. The way characters talk in this movie, you learn so much about them, their lives, and their prejudices and why they feel the way they do about the accused. Not only that, so many startling revelations that keep you hooked throughout. It's all really smart, without being pretentious.Again, the acting is incredible. All the jurors gave the required depth to their characters, and then some. I felt like they were people in real life. Speaking of real life, you do feel like you're there, like you're also a jury, thanks, again, to the writing, but also the cinematography. It's brilliant.Also, I must mention, the pacing is perfect. Fast, but not too fast, and with the perfect runtime. We never feel bored, yet the story unfolds naturally.I think I just found my new favorite movie.",10,0,0,17 January 2018
Justice League," Not very well made, but damn entertaining.
","Look, you gotta face it: Justice League is not that well made. There's a reason why a majority of critics don't like it. It feels very rushed. Entire character arcs were removed. In fact, I feel 45 minutes were cut at the VERY least. This movie has to introduce the Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman properly and still tell a good story. 2 hours isn't enough for that. We need 3. Maybe an extended cut would help. The tone was also quite inconsistent (maybe due to the fact that this movie went through re-shoots and was essentially directed by 2 separate people). And the villain wasn't very interesting. The CGI was okay though. Yes, it wasn't that good, but I didn't find it as bad as the others were saying.That being said, I was entertained. The movie is actually fairly fast paced for me, and seeing all of my favorite childhood heroes on screen was immensely satisfying, despite the cut backstories. (Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE me some Marvel, but DC for life!) The chemistry shared between the cast was really good, and the shared scenes were really entertaining.Also, the movie is, overall, much more lighthearted than BvS. I thought that latter movie was a bit too dark, even for Batman: Nolan's trilogy did better in that department. There's a lot of jokes in this movie, including more than a few at Batman's expense, and he also has a few funny lines. Weird.The cast overall does a good job portraying their characters, but I feel Batman should have been darker, maybe around Keaton's or Bale's level. Ben Affleck does a fine job playing him though. I also felt the Flash was more focused on comedy and not enough on the other emotions. Yes, Ezra Miller was good, but compared to Grant Gustin in the TV show, he is not as emotionally well realized, especially in the scene where he visits his father in prison. Of course, he didn't receive a lot of chance to develop thanks to the rushed production.Overall, while the movie is shaky, I quite enjoyed it, much more than BvS. I just hope WB releases an extended edition and stops messing with directors' work.",7,0,2,27 November 2017
Dunkirk," Nolan does it again.
","Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk has been perhaps one of the year's most awaited movies, quite rare for a war film. The man has been behind some of the best movies of the 2000s and 2010s, such as Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar.So how does Dunkirk fare against his other works?Quite well, actually. Dunkirk is an amazing movie, and you can really tell Nolan put loads of effort into it (the film was a passion project of his, apparently). The guy certainly knows how to direct a film, deftly weaving through multiple plot lines. It's a visual achievement: The film looks gorgeous, even in the digital screening I was subjected to. I can only imagine how incredible the IMAX 70mm version was. And yes, the film is rated PG-13, meaning there's not as much blood and gore as an R-rated movie like Saving Private Ryan. But the way this film is shot, it doesn't need it. The blood and gore may be an added bonus at best, or a gratuitous distraction at worst.The same can be said for the swearing: Of course, there is the usual PG-13 swearing (and even 2 f-bombs) but nowhere near the level of, again, Saving Private Ryan. But the way the dialogue is written, you probably wouldn't notice. Speaking of dialogue, there's not that much in it. This is a departure from Nolan's usually verbose scripts. He often lets the cinematography and sound design do the story telling.Speaking of sound design, there is some incredible work here. It is quite realistic, making the experience more immersive and terrifying; I can see an Oscar nomination in this area. The score is also insane: Thunderous and tense, this one is probably one of Hans Zimmer's best works, and that is saying something. He is one of the greatest composers working in the film industry.So, tight direction, beautiful cinematography, smart dialogue, incredible sound design and a fittingly intense score - why did I still give this movie an 8/10?Unfortunately, the shallow characterization is more than a small handicap to the experience. Nolan did this on purpose, but this is one of his decisions that, in my humble opinion, backfired. None of the characters are given any substantial character arcs; we don't even catch the names of a few (which sadly include the lead of the movie). This makes it difficult to latch on to the characters and care about why they're fighting. The closest we ever come to any character fleshing-out is Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson, and even that isn't much. It's an unfortunate choice, and prevents this movie from being the 'masterpiece' it probably could have been.Overall, though, I was really impressed with Dunkirk, and I'm really excited to see what Nolan does next.",8,5,10,23 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A rather perplexing film.
","MAY HAVE SPOILERS, IF NOT ALREADY MENTIONED.Okay, let's get this out of the way: I do not hate the Last Jedi. I do not hate any Star Wars film - Even Attack of the Clones, my least favorite movie in the franchise (I gave it a 3/10 on this site), I merely dislike. (There's a difference.) I also quite like The Force Awakens, even though everyone on the internet loves to crap all over it.That being said, I was rather let down by this movie. While I applaud Rian Johnson, the director, for having the guts to take the franchise into new areas, I feel he screwed with Star Wars lore a bit too much. For instance, I'm not entirely sure if the Force works in the way it is depicted here. I also did not like what was done with certain characters. Leia has a moment where she is in space, and she uses the Force to get somewhere. Now, I know she theoretically has the ability to use the Force, her being Anakin Skywalker's daughter after all, but she didn't learn to use it, as far as we know. Even if she DID, it came out of nowhere. This trilogy, sad to say, has no problem with overpowered characters. (Yes, Rey is still a little bit OP here, but it's handled better than Force Awakens.)Also, Luke was quite the sourpuss in this movie. I'm sorry, but that's the best way to put it. Yes, he was probably broken by what happened with Kylo Ren, but I'm not buying it. I won't say anymore, since I don't want to give away too much, even though this is a spoiler review. I will say, though, he has a really cool sequence towards the end of the movie. But, what happens in his arc later did not sit well with me.And yes, the Finn & Rose subplot was completely unnecessary. If a few certain characters didn't screw around did what they were supposed to do, we could have dropped this whole subplot and shaved off 45 minutes.Lastly, this movie also did injustice to 2 characters, namely Snoke and Admiral Ackbar.MORE SPOILERS BELOWFirst off, regarding Admiral Ackbar: We all remember this dude and his 'It's a trap' line from Return of the Jedi, right? He's rather well known. But he gets killed in this movie in a spaceship blast, unceremoniously. WTF?Next, regarding Snoke: We waited, for 2 years, to know more about a character shrouded in mystery. But nope, Kylo Ren just decides to just kill him in a move that makes no sense to me.This movie isn't all bad, though. The acting is solid, the score is brilliant as per usual, and the movie looks GORGEOUS. The story just disappointed me.If you're a casual Star Wars fan, or if you're not even a fan, you might like this one more than I did.Adam Driver said that this movie would be the Empire Strikes Back of the trilogy. One thing to note - that one initially perplexed people when it came out, just like this one, and is now regarded as the best Star Wars movie. I do hope the same thing happens here.",6,0,0,16 December 2017
The Dark Knight," The gold standard for superhero movies.
","When Batman and Robin came out in 1997, it was the nadir of the Batman franchise, and for superhero movies as a whole. This was the second superhero franchise WB screwed over (They ruined Superman a decade earlier with A Quest for Peace.) and Marvel wasn't making movies back then. There was no way people would take Batman seriously again.Cut to 2005 and then up and coming director Christopher Nolan made Batman Begins, the dark and gritty reboot that we ALL needed. It focused on who Batman (Christian Bale) was both beneath and outside of the cape and cowl. Between the great writing, performances, directing and score, Batman Begins was an incredible superhero movie, and topping it would be hard.And yet, The Dark Knight did exactly that. If Batman Begins was A New Hope, then TDK is Empire Strikes Back (The Dark Knight Rises was probably Return of the Jedi in terms of quality). This movie took its characters to morally dark and ambiguous areas, upped the stakes and most importantly, introduced Nolan's version of the Joker (portrayed masterfully by the late Heath Ledger, RIP) who is widely regarded as one of the best cinematic villains alongside Darth Vader and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. Of course, the Joker was already a legendary villain by virtue of the comics, cartoon and Jack Nicholson's awesomeness in the 1989 Batman movie, but Ledger made this character his own. He wasn't trying to imitate Nicholson or Mark Hamill from the cartoon. He perfectly understood the character, what he was all about, how he saw the world, and gave his own performance based on that. That Oscar was well deserved.But even without the Joker, this movie is wonderful. The directing and pacing were on point (one does not simply get bored), the other performances were great as well (I dig the weird Batvoice, haha) the dialogue was smart (though hard to follow) and it looked and sounded good too (Hans Zimmer should have been nominated). A side note: Nolan is a champion of practical effects over CGI, and that's mostly what you see here. And they look fabulous. Seriously, this is my favorite movie of all time.Because it's my favorite movie though, I'm gonna have to be a bit too harsh on it. I have three nitpicks with this movie that can largely be ignored. First off, the fight choreography is a bit weird at times (Who fights with their ELBOWS?) Second, I'm not a huge fan of Rachel Dawes. She was okay, but okay is not enough for a movie of this caliber. Third of all, again, the dialogue can be a bit hard to follow at times.Overall, this is an absolutely incredible movie and is guaranteed to be a major influence on future filmmakers.",10,0,0,10 January 2018
