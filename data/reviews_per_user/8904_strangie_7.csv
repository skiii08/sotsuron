Saturday Night Fever," Saturday Night Yawn
","I think that it's fair to say that I haven't seen a worse movie in my life (ok ... there's Blair Witch, Titanic, Pulp Fiction ...).  Saturday Night Fever takes out the prize as one of the least watchable films I've ever had the misfortune to see.  Being a child of the 70's I thought it'd be fun to have a bit of a look and I'm glad I was a little tipsy when I saw it otherwise I'd be even more scathing in my review.  The soundtrack and the dancing weren't that bad. The film should have stopped at that: dancing and music - an hour and a half music video.  Unfortunately the movie didn't stop there.  The plot was dreadful (dragging along with no real place to go), the dialogue was shockingly awful and the acting was just as good.This is the sort of film that could be used well in interrogation processes. I, for one, would be confessing to all manner of things before too long!!",1,8,25,14 January 2001
Meet the Parents," Meet(ing) the Parents has never been more amusing
","I crawled into the cinema after a particularly hot Melbourne day looking for something light and entertaining (i.e. not too taxing on the grey matter) and Meet the Parents certainly fit the bill.Robert de Niro's role, Jack Burns, is played convincingly and uncomfortably well.  He manages to play Jack with that evil glint that de Niro fans are all too aware of.  Ben Stiller also does well as the nervous soon to be son-in-law and Blythe Danner's Dina (the mother) is played with an almost Marilyn Munroe daffy blonde with biting insights to situations.The film itself doesn't really go anywhere, gets ridiculously silly in parts and the ending is inevitable.  Flashes of brilliant comedy save what could have a meandering film end, in particular the Airport scene, which is a riot!All in all not a bad film.",7,0,0,2 January 2001
Cast Away," Cast Away? Perhaps that should be Cast Out
","I'll start by admitting that Tom Hanks does nothing for me as an actor.  In fact, I think his only two decent films to date are Big and Philidelphia - and that's at a stretch.  I went into the film with a healthy dose of skepticism, but was fully prepared to be surprised.  Oh well, one outta two ain't bad!This is the sort of film where, if someone asked me what it was like, I respond with 'the cinematography was very good'.  Hanks joins Robert Zemeckis for the first time since Forrest Gump (don't even get me started on that waste of film).  The story itself is one of survival (d'uh!).  Chuck is a jet-setting Fed-Ex efficiency expert who jumps on a plane, and the plane decides to jump into the ocean.  Chuck survives and has to eke out a living on a deserted island. That's all there is to it really.  Oh, he's kept company by a picture of his girlfriend, Kelly and a volleyball named Wilson.There were some fleeting glimpses of brilliance in the film - how Chuck overcomes adversity living on an island, cooking, fires, home dentistry etc, but nothing too extraordinary.  In fact, boring in parts.  I think the film could have benefited from cuts to what's happening back home while he's on the island - mind you it would have meant involvement from the other actors - which would have spoiled the 'Tom Hanks alone in Cast Away' effect of the film.  Oh OK, credit where credit is due, Hanks did trim down fantastically for the film, and he looks, well, not that bad!  I think taut would be the word.  But that's enough gushing!  Fed-Ex too, must be rubbing its hands in glee with the free advertising this film has provided for them.It's a film that I wouldn't recommend highly to people, but at the same time, it's OK and worth a trip to see it on the big screen (because I think it'll lose a bit on the TV).  Now would someone please explain to me why Tom Hanks keeps winning these damn Oscars, because I'm stumped.",6,0,0,1 February 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Breathtakingly beautiful and empowering
","I think it's fair to say that I haven't seen such a beautiful looking film since Stealing Beauty (and rest assured, I am talking cinematography, not story).  The pure poetry of the scenery is magic and could well have survived as a movie on its own, without any help from a story!That said, the story is also quite extraordinary.  The 'magical' jade sword is stolen from it's rightful owner and a search for the thief ensues. Include a sub-plot of vengeance between the Jade Fox and the young man whose master was killed by Jade Fox and you have a story.  This is an incredibly simplistic synopsis.  I think the beauty of this whole film is its simplicity.  The relationships are uncomplicated, the reasons for revenge are simple.  Please don't think that this is me bagging it.  Quite the contrary.  I was moved, really moved by the this film and I highly recommend it.",8,0,0,8 February 2001
Coyote Ugly," It's not THAT bad!
","It's a story we've all heard before - girl from Hicksville moves to New York to make it big in songwriting.  Girl finds New York hard to break, girl meets boy, boy falls in love with girl, girl gets a couple of breaks (not the songwriting ones that she was hoping for thought), girl eventually falls in love with boy, songwriting career falls to the back burner.  Girl realises dreams are not being realised, girl gets ticked off with boy, boy gets the flick, both are miserable.  While girl is miserable she does something to realise dream. Dream is realised, credits roll.  End of movie.There is no serious thought needed to see this film.  Plenty of beautiful people to look at - which satisfies both the men (all the dancing chicks at the bar) and ladies (Adam Garcia ... phwor!!!) alike.  A marked departure from the action flicks that Bruckheimer normally produces and it works reasonably well, albeit in a sugar sweet way.",6,0,0,30 January 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Truth, beauty, freedom, love - all in a day's work for Moulin Rouge
","This is probably a biased review, given that I have long been a fan of Baz Luhrmann's works.  His envelope pushing has, what I think is, an Australian freshness about it - which is perhaps why it has received mixed reviews. 
The story is simple Christian (Ewan McGregor) has come to Paris, to Montmartre (the bohemian capital of France), to seek out freedom, truth, beauty and love. He enters the infamous nightclub the Moulin Rouge where he's instantly smitten by the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). She mistakes him for the Duke (the fabulous Richard Roxburgh in a brilliantly slimy role) who she's meant to seduce for money for a new play Christian is writing. But just like so many musical comedies the mistake strikes sparks of romance. Excellent cameo roles from Australian musical icons - Kylie Minogue, Christine Anu, Jackson Mendoza, Caroline O'Connor as well as well rounded performances from Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, David Wenham, Gary McDonald and Jacek Koman as a narcaleptic Argentinian.This is a complete rollercoaster ride - you run the gamut of emotions and with typical Baz style there's oodles of humour in it.  It's glitzzy glamourous, fast moving, funny, sad and entirely well worth the almost 2 wait for it to come to the screens.  The music, also, is extraordinary. From Elton John, to Marilyn Munroe, to Madonna, U2, Moby, Sting - together with a brilliant score.By the way - it's worth staying to the end of the credits for a small reminder of what the film is about.",10,0,1,23 May 2001
A Walk to Remember," A walk to bypass completely!!
","I have just had the misfortune to see this film.Mandy Moore and Shane West (the two leads) were at the premiere in Melbourne last night, and told us that they had fun making the movie and hoped that we have as much fun watching it.  I have to say that it was fun to watch it, but not for the reasons Ms Moore was hoping for, I'm sure.  It's a great film to sit back and take the mickey out of!Given the cast, you'd think this movie is aimed at 12/13 year old girls (and I assure you that 75% of the audience last night were in that demographic). I would suggest that you not take young kiddies, as there are some *ahem* adult themes that I didn't think were appropriate for them to see.The story was predictable, so much so that I was predicting 15 minutes in advance what was going to happen.  There was no real drive in the story, it just plodded along.To be fair, there were some good funny/poignant moments in the film, but they were only fleeting scenes.  This is a 'wait till it comes out on video' film (and even then I'd seriously consider giving it a swerve).",4,0,2,5 June 2002
