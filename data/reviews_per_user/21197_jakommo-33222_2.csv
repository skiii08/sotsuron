Ford v Ferrari," Beautiful enjoyable movie.
","I have no idea how much of it was just pure Hollywood fiction, but the movie was well made.And contained perfect examples why I hate corporate pen pushers.",10,3,4,29 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Depends on your point of view..
","I love original star wars trilogy.
story wise & few bits here and there.. after watching prequels for long years since they were out and several times.. I accepted them as a OK necessity even tho they are mostly bad or boring in general.BUT i couldn't care less about other star wars related stuff.. comics..series..funfiction.. apart from few games.I know everyone hates Disney for ruining SW,
because they just rebooted old story, completely ignored Lucas's ideas/terms etc etc..-----------------I actualy liked the SW VII exactly because of that!
It was a refreshment of old trilogy put into one movie.
With plenty of small details like mimicing the 'animatronic' effects from the 80s.
Visuals were actualy pretty good, story was OK. New antagonist.. i want to know more..
And they kind of started developing a relationship between Rey and Finn.it was filled with bunch of actor cameos / 'easter eggs'-----------------(Rogue One and Solo movies were actualy quite OK, leaving us craving for Darth Maul, Obi Van movies right ??)and now The Mandalorian series started, but i don't care about non movie stuff anyway-----------------SW WIII:
I liked those little 'caretakers' on Luke's island, those parts were funny..
they reminded me of Vogons from Hitchhikers through the Galaxy..
even tho they look sooooo different yet similiar..Leia being suddenly a force master was just so unentertaingin and awkward..
I'm sorry she should die instantly the moment she got out of the room/ship and movie goes on.. that part was just was stupid and meh..I found those 'force connections' between Rey and Ben kindof weird,
but why not.. FORCE telepathy / projection should be something bigger than our satelites and phone connections right?Except.. that part when Luke was just a force projection..yet he gave Leia those Han's little dice... wtf.. force teleport? things are getting out of hand here.Again.. visuals were amazing..ppl were revolting about nothing new in the trilogy.. I liked that salty planet...What I realy didn't like at all.. is the story..
Rey and Finn were alot more concerned about each other.. looks like there realy will be something between them..Ben keeps interfering with his connections etc etc, sure he is trying to turn her.. she is trying to turn him.. ok..BUT... HOW..WHY.. in the.. was that asian chick so damn important to basicaly be the headliner of the movie???Just to have maybe 2-3 appearances in SW IX?? i just couldn't care less about her..but Disney gave her so much camera time.. it was so ridiculous..and oh.. Snoke.. the mister powerful supreme leader.. we wanted to know more about him right?
too bad.. he died instantly from a single move that was screaming for attention yet he .. mister supreme didn't even think about the possibility..
let's forget him..it's like watching Hobbit movies..Smaug was the biggest threat and possible terror for 2 entire movies.. just to die within few minutes in the last one and that's it.. what a noob, just forget the fire lizard..-----------------SW IX:
what a mess...I guess some time passed... Leia mentored Rey. okWhat I liked in the movie.. again.. effects..visuals.. 'animatronic' like stuff..
I liked that Rey had Force Heal ability like in Jedi Academy games..
I liked Palpatine had Force Drain ability like in Jedi Academy games..
I liked that Rey fought with 2 swords ..even if just for seconds..but.. hm..
Rey is trying so hard to be good that she actualy uses dark powers.. ok..made sence in the end..
After fighting Ben and healing him.. Han's projection appears? turning Ben for good..
Rey and Ben formed 'force unity' that was more powerful than anything.. so Palpatine just drained then and restored his health.. lol..Until the lst moments of movie Finn and Rey cared about others destiny soooo much..
Rey was kissing Ben in an affection.. noone cares about Finn.. 2 movies developing relationship down the drain..i mean.. this movie is watchable..
entertaing? sure.. depends on what's your prefference and expectation..
story wise i was dissapointed..
but i didnt expect anything special becasuse i know wery well that hollywood can completely trash 'what was developed in previous movie/s'..
+ i had a bottle of wine .. just in case..it was like watching a 3 part soap opera and they didn't and nothing happened in the end..
i'm simply sad and dissapointed in general..SW has such a potential",5,0,4,17 March 2020
