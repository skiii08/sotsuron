The Blair Witch Project," I am STILL waiting to get my money back...
","Somebody actually compared this to Hitchcock? I felt ill when I saw that. I actually tried very hard to go to sleep during this movie just because I thought it might seem to be over a little faster. I absolutely did not buy in to the characters. I rooted for the witch, which to her credit never showed up in the film. Good move on her part. I wish I hadn't been there either.When they got to the map sequence, I actually wanted them all to die. I had absolutely no sympathy for these jerks. Yes, I know we are supposed to believe the 'witch' caused all these things - loosing the map, walking in circles, etc. I just didn't buy it. What I did buy was a bunch of idiots went wandering around in the woods. There was no witch - these people were just too stupid to be allowed to live, and thankfully Darwinism kicked in before they polluted the gene pool further. I hope... I am absolutely serious when I say I was rooting for the witch, by the way, but she took too long.I was not scared at any point during this film. I was extremely irritated. I would have killed them myself. The only good thing about this movie is that it IS only 80 minutes long - which reduces the amount of time you have to endure. I have a good imagination, and like it when a talented director lets the action happen in my head as much as on the screen. This film had no such director.This film should have been left buried under the foundation of the 'Blair witch house.' I would not ever see this again, even if offered a large sum of money, for fear that it might encourage these people further.",1,41,80,22 September 1999
Predator," Good sci-fi, maintains the tension
","This is one of my favorites, but then I've been an Ahnold fan for quite a while ('Ahl be bachk'). Carl Weathers is the only character I don't care for - for some reason he's just not convincing as 'Dillon' to me. The story line is basicly spelled out in the IMDb intro. The characters (less Dillon) come across as pretty believable to me, and the tension builds up pretty early and keeps building. You pretty much get the impression there's nothing Dutch & Co cannot handle, up through the rebel camp (early on, this isn't a spoiler). At least nothing of this earth they cannot handle...Some of my favorite lines are 'If it bleeds, we can kill it' and 'Do you think you could have found something bigger?'",8,1,2,4 April 2000
The Sixth Sense," Good flick, would see it again
","I thought Bruce Willis gave a strong performance, as did Haley Joel Osment (Sheesh! What a name! He was the kid, by the way). The ending absolutely made the movie. I thought the film was very well made. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, even staunch Bruce Willis anti-fans.",8,0,0,22 September 1999
The Matrix," Well worth the price of admission
","I thought the plot was pretty straight forward and predictable. I still thought it was a good story, just not too many unexpected twists and turns. The special effects, and the imagination inherent in the story were what sold this for me. I liked this enough I'd happily go out and buy a copy of this movie. I saw it on the small screen - I'd say this would be awesome on a movie screen.",9,0,0,26 September 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," My absolute favorite movie of all time
","This movie is hilarious, from the coconuts (Whoa, Patsy), to the swallows, your favorite color, gosh, there's just an awful lot to like here. The ending is anti-climatic, but then... what else could they have done? I have to admit the first time I saw the film, it was like being brought up short (sort of thought they'd just run out of budget and so stopped filming). But then I realized it was the only way to go.As much as I absolutely adore this film (note to self: watch Grail again this weekend) I have to warn: It is not for everybody. This is absolutely zanny. You have to sort of decouple yourself from any sense of reality and normalcy. Sit back, get a bucket of popcorn, and bring out your dead. I'll say no more (wink wink?), since so many others have said so much positive stuff. Did I mention I love this film?",Null,0,0,22 September 1999
