Black Swan," What I don't like about films like this.
","The acting is superb and the music enchanting. BUT If you want to read about further praises of this film, there are many good reviews. The problem I have with this film is very extreme and it's something many artsy films end up doing that I find very cowardly: SPOILERS FOLLOW: The logic of this film would lead some (like me) to believe that Nina (the main character) wasn't cast as the lead dancer at all. When the director told her he gave the role to someone else... well, he did and all the rest that followed was her delusional state.How can I say that? In the opening sequence Nina is dreaming she has the part. How do we know all that follows isn't a dream as well? Because the director didn't have the consideration to give us something solid to determine what's what. In the end he leaves us with this confusing ending that couldn't possibly have happened. The ending must have been a delusion since you can't dance with a gaping stomach wound. So we must invent a reality on our own. That is a cruel joke to play on an audience. At the very least the ending needed to show some clue as to what was real and what was imagination. That is what great movies do and that is why this movie falls short.An artistic person might be able to dismiss the illogical and accept the 'feelings' of distress the movie portrays, but in the end there is no way to determine the world (or the actions) of the film. This is unacceptable to me and it shows a careless intent by a director who isn't willing to make his narrative clear.With that I give this a 7, but by no means is this a best picture award film. Best acting... perhaps.",7,2,5,17 January 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Stay away from this.
","This is not a good movie on any level. It isn't funny. It isn't educational except in a very juvenile way, and it certainly isn't worth the ticket price. George Clooney was good, I will give him that, but as for the other actors... what happened? You could tell they were sorry to be in the film. I think what looked good on paper became a disaster in production.My problem with this movie is three fold. The pacing is slow, the characters are mostly cardboard, and the story line is pretty boring. There were three good laughs that were okay, but two shock scenes that they should be ashamed of. There's nothing funny about presenting facts about past events where someone was killed or maimed due to another persons abject stupidity.There are certainly facts here (things based on mistakes made during the Vietnam war) that can shock a few people who don't remember or never heard of the drug culture of the 60s. But overall it's just military bashing. There is no story. This is just an array of mindless skits and ignorant plot points.It's easy to make fun of the military for their past mistakes, but the writer of this film had the advantage of hindsight to slap them around with. How many mistakes are we making now? Depleted uranium? Defective flack jackets? Would anyone be justified in making fun of soldiers who died defending this country? Lastly, the final scene was meant to redeem the insults, but it fell far short. No amount of camera trickery can remove the bile flung at the military and those few who were misguided in their methods.",4,3,10,17 November 2009
Dunkirk," I don't understand all the hype. Several scenes were ridiculous.
","This movie is a snapshot glance at possible events during the evacuation of the allied troops at Dunkirk after the military disaster following the German invasion of France in 1940. I was pretty much bored throughout the first half of the movie and at various times thereafter. Although the historical significance of the events are captured to a limited degree, several of the fictional elements shown were actions of abject stupidity and left me stunned. #1: No hospital ships were sunk by German aircraft at Dunkirk. #2: The events in the beached trawler were so absurd I doubt any person could be so ignorant. Soldiers trying to plug 30-50 bullet holds in the hull with their fingers and then thinking that killing and throwing out a French soldier would make up for tons of continuous flooding. #3: The shooting down of the German bomber (an event that would have taken 30 second in real time) took 10 minutes in film time. I decided the Spitfire must have been flying at about 1 mile an hour. #4: The killing of the teenager had no significance and was a totally pointless plot device. #5 The out of fuel spitfire then made several impossible aerial maneuvers to shoot down a German plane flying 200 miles an hour faster than it was. The only truly heroic person in the movie was the civilian boat captain who managed to dodge his boat around a German fighter attack, a totally absurd scenario. I have never, however, seen anything that indicated German aircraft attacked any small civilian boats. All and all I can't express my disappointment with this movie. I don't think its terrible, but it is certainly not praise worthy.",5,47,87,26 July 2017
