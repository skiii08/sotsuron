The Double Life of Véronique," The simple message of Véronique
","Friends,I am not writing about the artistic valences in this film. In my opinion there is also a simple point Kieslowski intended to transmit. Think about this.In the end of the movie the French Véronique says something like this: 'She must die for making possible to me to live'. What is this? Well, the Polish Véronique symbolise Poland and the French one France.After the Second War Poland and the other East countries were sacrificed to live in communism just for countries from West Europe should continue to LIVE a normal life. It is simple. Opinions?Regards, George - former Est Europe citizen",Null,10,21,19 March 2002
