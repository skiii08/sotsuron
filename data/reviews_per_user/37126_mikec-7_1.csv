Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Big disappointment!
","As someone who saw the original Star Wars on the big screen when first released, I was very disappointed by this tepid offering. In the original movies there were excellent characters such as Solo, Obi-Wan and Vader. Here, everyone is as insipid as Skywalker and Leia were in the original.Lucas doesn't seem to be able to direct actors. The film is nothing more than a marketing tool for games and gadgets. It's impossible to have any empathy for the characters in this movie; there are none.",3,0,1,24 September 1999
