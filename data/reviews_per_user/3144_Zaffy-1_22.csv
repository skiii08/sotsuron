Black Swan," Overrated I am afraid..
","The director shares with us the repulsive story of a psychopath in all the disturbing details. As he usually does in his movies. But this time the trip feels cheap and forced . And boring. And forced.During the entire movie I was pushed so hard to feel this horror story that after a while I simple didn't care anymore. And all this 'trip' wondering what is reality and what's not got really repetitive and pointless after a while. (Another new trend in the movies today, not to know what's real or not..oh well.. confusing is the new black)I would appreciate it better if Aronofsky was narrating about an average character and her descent to hell under some circumstances instead of the obvious, to tell the story of a really troubled woman (to say the least). The duality of the main character is also for laughs.The 'white Swan' side of the heroine is a shy virgin 25+yo who always listens to her mom and lives only between her teenager room and the ballet. The 'black swan' side is an arivist,manipulative, sociopath, murderer, oh yes and ESPECIALLY someone who likes or even dares to have sex (with the same sex no less!). Wow I didn't know having sex or even touching yourself brings you in the dark side...Two extremes in the two corners fighting till death. Does the creator underrates its audience or he doesn't believe in the power of his storyto simplify it that much? Or he simply tries to tell us the story of a psychopath in a tad confusing way?In any case, IMHO, none of the above worked well. p.s. I would praise Portman's performance but I think the sides of her character were way too loud and obvious so I doubt she had too much trouble portraying the two swans.",4,11,29,2 January 2011
Child 44," watch Citizen X instead
","What a mess!
Badly written, badly directed, overacted..
I dunno how the book is but the film is bad.
Which is an 'achievement' considering the very good cast.
I strongly suggest to watch Citizen X instead, less Hollywood material much much better of a movie.",2,0,1,16 July 2019
The Death of Stalin," not very good...
","I am a fan of 'Veep' and 'the Thick of it' but I do not think Iannucci's style worked well here.
Most of all though, I am not sure that the last days of a regime that killed millions can be a comedy full with characters-caricatures.It is like making a comedy about a genocide.
The result was really awkward...and unsettling..
Made me felt uncomfortable, not because of the events described in the movie but mainly because of how they were described.
You cannot try to be witty with something that cost the lives of millions.
You must show respect to the victims. What will we have next? A slapstick comedy about the Nazis while planning the 'final solution'?",4,8,21,14 April 2018
Spotlight," there is something missing from making this a great movie
","The topic is interesting, the real story is horrifying, the cast is stellar. But it is not working that well.. and I think it is the directing and maybe the editing. You do not feel the impact of the drama. It is like if an assistant with a camera is just following the heroes. It is distant, you cannot feel the tense, the importance of the case ... And acting could be a bit better as well. Maybe the actors were too focused imitating the real people behind the characters instead of showing emotions.Still, it is a movie I recommend you to watch.",6,11,24,28 December 2015
American Sniper," failed in every level
","I cannot believe that the same man behind this also created a masterpiece like 'Letters from Iwojima' First of all I am not aware of the true story this is based on, so I will only talk about what the movie gave me.I am not gonna accuse this movie for propaganda cause I don't believe there is any. It is just a mess of a film. Not sure what Clint had in mind but nothing seems accomplished. The hero's characterization is shallow. The war scenes have the impact of passing a COD level. There is nothing here.. nothing.. its like if a mindless person joins the army and stays there till he passes the final level of dealing with the enemy sniper. This seems to be the main focus of the movie, the duel with the enemy sniper.Wanna see how war fraks up soldiers? Wanna see what kind of hell war is? Just watch Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwojima. Two movies also by Clint Eastwood.",2,24,57,21 February 2015
American Hustle," someone hustled the movie..
","How to waste good performances with a bad script and an uninspired directing.The cast is good in this one. Really good. But they cannot save this film from being aimless, pointless, meaningless, bra-less. Two whole long hours without any interest, except maybe all the cleavage. Too much cleavage. I was kid in the 70s, but I don't remember women not to wear their bra all the time. Oh and the cinematography... who had the brilliant idea to film it with an 'instagram' filter? The hairdos, the costumes weren't enough to portray the era? we needed the 'old photography from the 70's' filter? So annoying.In conclusion, no spark,no rhythm, no tension, no highlights just the cast and the efforts of the editor to give us the 'Good Fellas of Hustling', but good editing alone can't help bad directing and storytelling.Another hyped movie that will collect nominations and probably awards for being just above average. Doh..",5,2,3,11 January 2014
Dunkirk," a failed attempt of whatever this was supposed to be
","I am not even sure of what I just watched...
Was it a series of 'vignettes' about the Dunkirk evacuation?
Was it a long music video clip with a WWII theme?
Was it the prologue of a new WWII video game?all I know is that:
-it wasn't realistic
-it wasnt well acted 
-it had poorly written (if at all) characters
-it never succeeded to make me feel anything.. nor the war terror, not any sympathy for the heroes (who??) not any agony for the whole evacuation.
Nothing, nada, niente.In an a nutshell, I never understood what the Director wanted to say with this movie. I am not even sure what he had in mind..
This film failed to give me anything at all.3 stars only for the great music.",3,2,3,27 December 2017
Yesterday," Managed to make Beatles songs sound indifferent..
","The main problem with this movie is the lead character.
He is a singer without any kind of charisma at all. It is not the material he sings, it is him. He is just a bad performer. I found it very difficult to believe he would make any of the Beatles songs popular now days.
Not sure if it is the actor or the director, could be both, the thing is he managed to make Beatles songs sound...boring. And this is an achievement, but not of the good kind.",2,2,6,17 February 2020
Gone Girl," watch 'the War of the Roses' instead
","I really don't get why this movie has this grade.Of course, liking something or not is subjective. I don't agree with the superfluous moral message of this movie , but that is just my opinion.But I can't overlook how this message is delivered. And it is bad.. it is obviously bad.Acting: I am sorry Ben, I like you but I think you are either a robot with a faulty emotions chip or someone with a rare face muscles disease that doesn't allow you to express your feelings. Maybe you don't have a face Ben and you are wearing a wooden mask instead. The thing is, you can't act to save your life. Wasn't impressed by Pike's acting either (even if she can act, truth to be said).Story: SO unrealistic, so badly written. None from the writing team has ever watched Law and Order on TV? Not even CSI? Not even Murder she wrote?? No one cared about the plot holes? But let's say the crime story was the way to deliver the 'message'. What to say about the dialogues? Do real ppl talk like this? I was pinching myself during the whole first date sequence. Like a cheap love novel. Awful! And it kept going like that till the end.Directing: I bet Mr. Fincher patted himself on the back after shooting every single scene. I also guess he was so busy trying to film scenes nicely, that he didn't even notice how horrible the script was. Or maybe he didn't care..3/10 only for Ben's assets... (no, not his acting, the other..thing)",3,5,11,1 January 2015
The Imitation Game," a lovely TV movie! oh...wait.....
","it is not a TV movie, isn't?No, it is supposed to be Oscars material. The tale of the special person that can have an impact to the world, presented in a shallow and full of clich√©s way. And of course the real story was bent enough to give us the Triumph of the man against all odds and...and well...we have seen all this a bazillion times before and in better TV movies than this one.The cast is good with the material they have but nothing extraordinary. Even Cumberbatch gives another 'Sherlockian' performance. Truth to be told, he did well with the material he had to work with.A pleasant two hours of a movie you will forget very soon. Except if the movies you have seen so far in your life are less than 50. Including TV movies :)",5,5,14,23 January 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," not good.. not good
","I liked a lot the first Avengers, I like the actors, the characters but this was an average movie and I am polite here.After the 'Winter Solider', which I find the best movie of all the MCU I have watched so far, I expected a very good sequel. Never happened. The script was bad, the 'humor' was lame comparing to the 1st one, the story was confusing and the villain was a not scary mess. Maybe because I am not comics expert I failed to understand parts of the story..but still I believe the plot was really weak. Endless sequences of long battles that I had no interest about. Was I supposed to feel sad when one of the twins heroically died? In a nutshell, I was bored, which is the last thing I expected to feel while watching a film like the Avengers. Hopefully they will do better next time.",5,5,12,21 August 2015
The Dark Knight," Did I see a different film than most of you?
","I watched it yesterday. I came here to read user comments and I was :O, No 3 movie of all times?If it wasn't 3 hours LONG I would go and re-watch it just to see what did I miss that most of you loved so much. I honestly fail to see what all this hype-hysteria is about..First of all I think the film is way too long than it should be and got to be repetitive after one point. I mean how many times you need to see Joker doing the same things to understand that he is a very intelligent maniac/schizo/sociopath/whatever and can trick and manipulate everyone? Yes we got it, Joker is a schizophrenic genius or whatever, like Ledger's irritating acting wasn't enough. Oh yes, there are many horribly given Oscars out there you will soon can add one more for Heath for probably the worst performance of his career. If that wonderful and extremely talented actor was still alive he wouldn't even get an nomination. Except if you think that talking like crazy and overusing your tongue tick to show you are unstable is a first class acting. I thought Jack Nickolson typecasts but his Joker was a masterpiece comparing to Ledger's. Its really unfortunate that for this caricature acting he will be remembered and honored.The only performance worth of mentioning was Gary Oldman's. As for the rest of the movie, directing was first class, art direction not bad, cinematography was OK, the music was good, the script was.....What was the script about again? OK its a comic so that could justify the numerous plot holes (I can't even imagine how Joker with the help of mentally ill people can trap a whole city like this, not to mention the ridiculous two-face unreal makeup to name a few..). What else the script was about? That you can only beat chaotic terrorists by bending human rights (the mobiles sonar system) but its OK if you only do it once? hmmm dangerous! That good in people always beats evil? yeah! that! it 's like ethics for dummies...but maybe this is what young people need now-days, basic ethics and values teached by a rather boring Hollywood Movie. Which now makes me understand why it is rated so high.. doh.. hmmm dangerous.. learning values from Hollywood...",2,10,22,23 August 2008
Sicario," Promising but never lives up to the potential
","Despite the good cast and the very interesting topic we get as a result a rather average and very confused movie.All this because of the weak script.I am not even sure what the movie wanted to tell. It was like a bad documentary with a very weird structure. It starts with a bang and from there it never escalates, there is no climax. At the end you barely care about what happens.Characters were never really built and we didn't care about them. There were all bit clich√©: the CIA cowboy, the silent avenger that shoots more than he talks, the FBI woman that of course has no life and always follows the rules. And of course there were plenty of unrealistic/meaningless scenes: The one with transferring a very important Mexican criminal to USA by crossing the Bridge of Americas and ending up getting stuck in traffic. I was laughing out loud at this scene. I guess CIA can orchestrate a whole convoy of cars and jeopardize the safety of its agents instead of simply using a helicopter (that they use later so they do have one!). Next, they torture the same criminal on American ground (the same CIA that used to send prisoners for 'interrogation' everywhere except USA) only to make a plan so they can find a drug lord and very easily kill him by sending one (1) person to his house. John Rambo would be proud.Not that killing a drug lord is the solution of bringing down the cartels. Cause according to our CIA cowboy's amazing logic, the problem is the demand of drugs and those who use them. Makes you wondering, will they start killing drug users anytime soon? I mean eliminate the demand you eliminate the offer. Right? Right?",5,4,12,9 October 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," mediocre I am afraid and controversial
","I saw the movie mostly for Jessica Chastain. Plus the story was supposed to be interesting. But at the end I got really disappointed. Nothing impressed me in this movie. Kathryn Bigelow was in much better form in 'Hurt Locker'. The writing was bad so she didn't get any help from it either. I also found the editing poor. There was no rhythm in the whole movie, no power, no tension, no strong scenes, no character's development (basically no characters at all), nothing that made me care. Not even during the raid scene.I think Chastain did whatever she good with a VERY mediocre material and a rather uninspired direction. As much as I like J.Chastain, I don't think this is her best performance,but as I said, not her fault. I just have this feeling that if she gets the Oscar this year it would be more for her overall presence in movies than in this actual role.As for the torture controversy. Does this movie goes pro torture? in my opinion it does. The scenes weren't shocking or powerful so I don't think she wanted to condemn torture. She made them shown like just a daily routine of some good CIA agents that one moment they torture a guy and the next moment they wanna go for a coffee. Plus how many times we heard on the film that 'we cant get more info because we cannot torture anyone anymore'? which according to CIA it is a lie, since none of the info leading to find OBL was obtained by interrogation.So I dunno if Bigelow did it on purpose but yes it is a pro-torture movie that presents one big anti-terrorism success as a result of torturing terrorists.In conclusion, it had potentials that never reached. 5 only for Chastain and Jason Clark.",5,5,12,26 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," too much hype for a disappointment ..
","This one lacked soul and not sure it had a focus as well. It failed to make me feel anything for its characters, except maybe for the cruel sadistic master.But a movie talking about the dark times of slavery should focus more on the life of the slaves. Instead of feeling the main hero's agony and troubles I was just horrified by the actions of his awful master.In any case, it didn't tell us anything more than what we have seen before in much better movies or/and TV series.It is not a great movie and I can't understand all the hype about it. 'Oscar movies' are more mediocre every year...",5,6,12,11 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," an uninspired copy of the Good Fellas
","What I really hated in this movie wasn't the hysterical douche bag characters. It wasn't the Long duration, nor that DiCaprio was playing like a 'master of ceremonies' in Cabaret. It wasn't even the repetitive drug party scenes nor the sexistiest of uses of women.What I really disliked was that Scorsese blinked an eye at all this and. For more than 2 and half hours we were 'celebrating' with the greedy scums and their joys. For 30mins or so, we were supposed to feel the fall of the greedy bastards. I didn't feel a thing. And that scene with the FBI agent inside the miserable metro... oh dear...I can only grade this movie as a bad copy of Good Fellas. An overrated flat film that it is interesting only if you watch it as a docudrama.",2,6,13,18 January 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," 'Agatha Christie' for idiots
","This is so bad.. such a great cast such a bad movie.You guess soon who did it, I mean the movie hints it very early, unlike the 70's movie when you are genuinely surprised.And why on earth Poirot was interrogating ppl outside in the snow? 
And of course Branagh is an awful Poirot. Awful.
Now that the others act much better...Just watch the 1974 movie.",2,2,4,4 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," not bad, even though a bit TOO long
","I have only admiration for those watched the movie in the theaters. 3h is too long guys. This was material for 2 movies combined into one. I confess I fast forwarded a bit...Anyway, apart from its length, this is an entertaining movie, nothing extraordinary but OK to watch with friends on a cold winter night having lots of popcorn on the side.I didn't pay much attention to the plot and the comic characters, cause well I am not even sure the creators cared about it. My major issue was with Jesse Eisenberg acting. He was ultra annoying from the very first minute. I do not understand why comic villains must be like caricatures. He is supposed to be scary not ridiculous.. Best thing in the movie? Wonder Woman!",5,0,2,20 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," When JJ ruins another movie series you used to like
","That was a really awkward remake of episode IV.. with much worse characters and weak story. Sigh..I was counting on you Star War fans, but you disappointed me. You went by the millions to watch the new movie and now J.J. will keep ruining this franchise as well. As he did with Star Trek.Yeah yeah both franchises keep earning lots of $$$ but both are ruined. Well who knows, maybe the 2nd movie of the trilogy might bring something new to the story, one can only hope (spoiler: as we hoped for Star Trek before we had that...horrible 2nd movie).4 stars for the new robot and Hans Solo. 0 stars for J.J. who I wish one day (SOON) he will realize he has to retire from the movies at an early age and enjoy his wealth and glory, away from anything Star(s) related.",4,18,27,27 March 2016
Deadpool," the sad story of a Superhero who only wanted to be a stand up comedian
","I suspect before becoming a soldier and a mercenary, Wade Wilson must had tried very hard to become a stand up comedian for teenagers. With no success.It is painfully obvious that our hero desperately tries to do stand up comedy during the whole film: while fighting, while working, while having sex, while being tortured, etc etc. He is even talking to invisible people ( I guess he is fantasizing he has an audience, the poor bastard..). Sometimes he does manage to make good jokes. But most of the times his non-stop comedic delirium is falling flat. Soon you wish his mutation will extend to his vocal cords and you will be spared with a few minutes without juvenile jokes about..well everything. In vain. The wanna-be-comedian torture continues till the end.4 stars for the scene where Ajax gags him. I literally cheered!",4,8,20,22 May 2016
Spectre," a pleasant surprise
","Well I am not a big fan of Graig's Bond but I quite enjoyed this one!OK there were some plot holes, but you know it is a James Bond movie and reality never was one of the series assets.It contains some great actions scenes, like the opening one in Mexico or the car chase in Rome and I like the ethic of the main story (surveillance and all).The only thing that annoyed me was the cinematography and the colors filters like if the whole damn thing was filmed under various instagram filters. Not sure what this added to the story (except frustration, that is).Highly recommended for 2 and half hours of good pop corn time.",7,1,5,1 May 2016
The Martian," kind of a let down
","The main problem with the Martian, is that we don't feel the desperate condition Mark is supposed to be. I am not sure if this is a directing problem or Mat Damon's approach to the role. The thing is, the stranded hero is so cool and calm and super smart that makes everything to appear so easy. It is like if you are watching Superman doing his daily chores. Maybe this could work better as a mini-series. Or focus on what is going on in the planet and not on earth. Only during the end, when our hero is almost starved and weak he finally shows human. Well at least till the moment he casually says 'I am OK just broke my ribs'. So it is an interesting movie, especially while watching all the tricks and solutions each side finds to help our hero come back home.But it is without a feeling and strong emotion. Something that Apollo 13 did much much better.",5,2,6,26 December 2015
