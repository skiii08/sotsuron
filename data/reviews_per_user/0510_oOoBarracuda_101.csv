Vertigo," Vertigo
","In 2012, Sight and Sound dethroned Citizen Kane as the best film of all time, ending a 50-year reign as the top film. The film in which they named the best film, was Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. Made in 1958 starring James Stewart and Kim Novak; I was really looking forward to seeing what so many thought was a superior film to the god-like Citizen Kane masterpiece. Vertigo explores obsession and how deeply obsession can take root and the disastrous effects that can have on everyone involved. When a retired San Fransisco detective is asked to do a favor for a friend, and obsession takes root, lives are changed forever. John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart), a retired detective living in San Fransisco, has been forced to leave his job as a debilitating case of acrophobia, or, vertigo has taken control of him after being involved in a roof-top chase resulting in the death of a subject. Adjusting to a more low-key life, Scottie is spending a lot of time connecting with friends, such re-connections have led him to an old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Gavin shares with Scottie that his wife has been exhibiting some odd behaviors, in which she has episodes in which she seems to believe that she is the reincarnation of a deceased ancestor. Gavin explains that she experiences these episodes, then abruptly comes out of them, never remembering what she experienced while she was enduring the episode. Gavin asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) as he is concerned for her sanity. Scottie obliges, and as he begins to follow her, he gets to know her and almost instantly falls in love with her. Scottie doesn't just fall in love with Madeleine, though, he becomes deeply obsessed with her. After saving her life several times from her attempted suicides, Scottie is unable to save her when she climbs to the top of a bell tower she intends to jump from, due to his vertigo. After several months of brooding after his obsession, Scottie feels magnetically drawn to a woman who looks just like Madeleine and takes her shopping and to die her hair so she may look identical to his obsession. Scottie was making a woman in Madeleine's image until he realizes he has been duped by an intricate puzzle he has unknowingly been a part of. I'm a sucker for openings and movie introductions. Vertigo opens in a brilliant way with an equally as brilliant introduction to Kim Novak as the stunning beauty that kidnaps the eye in the restaurant scene. The colors in this film are fantastic and all of Hitchcock's trials with color come to wonderful fruition with Vertigo. A psychological thriller to end all thrillers, Vertigo is a wonderfully intricate puzzle which is a superb treat for the audience to piece together. Technically, Vertigo is a film to study by anyone interesting in filmmaking or understanding films on a deeper plane and artistic level. The shot composition is divine in Vertigo, creating a work of art in each scene. I am quite partial to Jimmy Stewart and thought he did a wonderful job in the complex role of Scottie. One thing that has always struck me about Vertigo was how unfairly blamed Stewart was for the failure of the film. Vertigo was not commercially or critically successful upon its release, and he shouldered much of this blame on Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock and Stewart had worked together three times previously, and their fourth film, Vertigo would be their last because Hitch thought someone like another stock actor of his, Cary Grant, would have brought more sex appeal to the role and producing a better final product. Unfortunately, Hitch seems to miss all that Stewart brings to the role, the deliberate motions, and movements that Grant would have faltered with. In any regard, Vertigo has etched a place in history and for just cause as a true illustration of Hitchcock's mastery.",8,6,7,2 November 2016
Black Swan," Black Swan
","I have a very hit and miss relationship with Darren Aronofsky's films. I couldn't stand Requiem for a Dream but quite enjoyed The Wrestler. Pi was wonderful, and I remember disliking Black Swan when I first watched it shortly after its release. I am thankful that I watched Black Swan again because, after this second critical viewing, I experienced so much more technique fused with a narrative that I enjoyed. Black Swan follows Nina Sayers as she transforms herself into the perfect portrayal of the Swan Queen in Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'. As she becomes more consumed by the role, she begins to lose her grip on the line between perception and reality. Starring Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, the 2010 film by Darren Aronofsky was a brilliant psychological exploration illustrating the depths someone will go to achieve another person's idea of perfection.Always chasing her big break, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a ballerina who is constantly practicing and working on her technique when she hears that Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) the artistic director of a New York City ballet company is casting Swan Lake. The director is one that Nina is desperate to impress as she joins the countless others vying for the lead of the production. At any other time, the lead would have gone to company favorite, Beth Macintyre, but now that she has been forced to retire, Thomas is looking for another star which heightens the intensity of the auditions. No one needs the role as much as Nina, who lives with her overly involved mother, a former ballerina who now lives vicariously through her daughter. Thomas recognizes Nina's ability and has no reservations that she can capture the essence of the beautiful and graceful white swan piece of the performance. It is the darkness needed to portray the black swan that Thomas believes Nina may not be able to capture. Thomas begins using manipulative measures in order to bring about a darkness he has never before seen in Nina. The manipulation of Thomas, and the internalized pressures Nina puts on herself to become someone else and replace Beth brings her to hallucinations and an inability to discern between what is actually going on and what is going on in her mind. Thomas also begins to pit her against another dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis) who he believes has no problem capturing the essence of the black swan. With that added element of competition and insecurity, Nina loses her grip on reality even further and begins to fall victim to the circumstances around her.Darren Aronofsky's camera work especially the constant movement and out-of-focus shots were a genius way to illustrate the constant whirlwind of what was going on in Nina's psyche. The exploration of Nina losing more of her own individuality as she attempts to become another person was brilliantly executed by Aronofsky. As she spends more time with Lily and sees the ease with which she lives her life, she begins to convince herself that becoming more like Lily will be to her benefit. The more she actively tries to become another person, however, she loses her own uniqueness that initially inspired Thomas to select her for the lead in the first place. Another interesting aspect of Black Swan is the hallucinations the audience is allowed to experience from Nina's perspective. Just as Nina is unsure of which of her experiences are happening in her mind and which are taking place in actuality, the audience is also left to wonder what is actually happening. With an ending in which has been discussed since the film released, Black Swan is an exquisite turn in the filmography of director Darren Aronofsky.",10,1,3,23 March 2017
Love and Death," Love and Death
","Woody Allen is proving himself to me as a versatile director expelling the notion that he can only write films featuring a neurotic Jewish man. That character exists in almost every Woody Allen film, yes, but I disagree with the idea that all of Allen's films are the same. To begrudge a director for putting too much of himself into his art has always been a difficult criticism for me to hear. Love and Death, the 1975 film is a period piece set in czarist Russia starring Allen as a man hopelessly in love with a woman who is determined to marry anyone but him. Boris (Woody Allen) is in love with Sonja (Diane Keaton), the both are pseudo-intellectuals so the match seems to be perfect. Sonja, however, is not 'in love' with Boris. Love is all that occupies Boris' mind, but all that must change when he is forced to join the Russian army. Boris is a committed pacifist, therefore is now tasked with trying to avoid hurting anyone while also being tasked with battling Napoleon's forces which have just invaded Austria. The two take diverging paths but are reunited once again when they must plot to assassinate Napolean.There is a scene in Love and Death in which several coffins are upright in a field and each one opens and the bodies come out and begin to dance in the field; that scene is my favorite scene in Love and Death. I have a habit of deciding which scene in each Woody Allen film I see is my favorite scene because there is always at least one stand out scene in each of his films. The writing in Love and Death was exquisite, as always, and especially biting which was a joy. One of my favorite things, as I've noted before, is when a film can successfully break the 4th wall, and there is a perfect scene in which Woody Allen himself breaks that wall down and speaks directly to me. It's as close as I'll ever get to my favorites, so I'm happy to take a 4th wall break. Death is in the title, but I am still loving how Woody Allen deals with his nihilism/uncertainty about God/the meaning of life in each of his films. Which is good, because it looks like Allen's focus on death is never hidden in his films.",9,1,1,7 July 2017
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin
","Because my personality is incredibly rooted in the Type A persuasion and I like to theme my month's viewing schedule, I don't get as much time for rewatches as I would like. When the opportunity arose to include Lucky Number Slevin on one of my monthly lists, I took it. I watched Lucky Number Slevin shortly after its 2006 release and was impressed by it, I was so impressed by it that I introduced it to some friends and family members after my first viewing. It's always interesting to see when 10 years elapses if one still enjoys a film as much as they did soon after its release, all the more reason I'm disappointed I don't have more time for rewatches, alas, there are so many films to see. A star-studded cast including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley lead an intensely gripping mystery in which every piece of filmed action is pivotal to the story. Paul McGuigan directs an engaging story told in an energetic way creating a story that necessitates watching until the final moment. While waiting at an airport, a mysterious figure tells a stranger the story of a fixed horse race in the mid-70's that resulted in the deaths of a family. The story is centered around the idea of a Kansas City Shuffle in which attention is drawn to one thing while deceit is happening in the other direction. Meanwhile, present-day the sons of two feuding mob bosses are shot down, as well as two bookies. Happening simultaneously, a young man named Slevin has sought refuge in his friend's apartment after finding out that his girlfriend has cheated on him. Caught immediately in a web of mistaken identity, Slevin realizes he has borrowed the apartment of a friend who owes several powerful people large amounts of money. Acquiescing to the needs of each mob boss in hopes of keeping himself alive, Slevin puts himself into some dangerous situations. The stakes are heightened when Slevin meets and falls in love with a chatty neighbor who works as a coroner. Soon, Slevin is being watched or followed from three different angles leaving the audience to determine what link exists connecting all the pieces. I was thrilled to learn that this film was every bit as exciting and engrossing as it was the first time I watched it, nearly 10 years ago. There are few things I appreciate more than a story that comes together so seamlessly with every single thing that was filmed having a place in the narrative. Lucky Number Slevin employs a stellar cast to bring together the brilliant story line. Flashbacks were used often in Lucky Number Slevin and were done in a unique and engaging way. Films like Lucky Number Slevin prove that mystery as a genre is alive and well, still maintaining a place in today's cinema.",9,0,0,2 May 2017
The Sound of Music," 'You have to live the life you were born to live.'
","I have no idea how I have gone 27 years without seeing The Sound of Music, yet simultaneously knew all the songs featured. I'm also glad that I know the origin of the popular internet meme of Julie Andrews dancing in a field; I enjoy knowing where things come from! This Rodgers and Hammerstein's collaboration directed by Robert Wise starring Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer has remained a classic long after its 1965 release. The film's message is clear and relatable; love will always exist, and only you can live your life. A pure tale told with exceptional acting and eye-catching cinematography; it is no wonder that The Sound of Music took home Oscar's top prize for Best Picture for 1965.In the middle of the 1930's Austria, Maria (Julie Andrews) is trying desperately to become a nun. When a letter is sent to the convent that a Captain in the Navy needs a governess to tend to his 7 rambunctious children, Maria is awarded the task. After getting initiated into the home with a frog in the pocket, and a pine cone in her chair, Maria understands that she has her work cut out for her caring for Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) gaggle of children. Since his wife's death, Captain, as he wishes to be called, has run his home as tight as the ships he commands. After successfully warding off each of the previous governess's, Maria is thrown a bone by the youngest Von Trapp child who declares that she likes Maria immediately after her arrival. Maria's kind and joyful disposition brings happiness back to the bleak Von Trapp household. Maria's presence also gains the attention of the Captain, who is engaged to be married to a wealthy baroness. As the feelings grow between Maria and the Captain, the two begin to question the choices they have made in their lives and begin to accept the lives they were born to live.Opening with overhead shots of vast mountains, eternal sky, and majestic seas, it is more than worth mentioning that the cinematography in this film is beyond compare. There were amazing shots all throughout the film, culminating in a great shot of Maria and Captain professing their love for each other. The chemistry between Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews was convincing and endearing. They worked so well together on-screen that I teared up upon their reunion at the Von Trapp house. Chemistry had to be believable seeing as Maria was convincing Captain that he needed to foster relationships with his children when he believed the only relationship that needed to exist there was a dictatorial one. Christopher Plummer's progression to rigid authoritarian to affectionate music-playing dad was incredibly well-acted. I would recommend this film, really, to anyone. Even if you aren't a fan of love stories or musicals, I believe, you will enjoy this film. The message of the film is one that persists, and can resonate with any viewer; 'You have to live the life you were born to live.'.",8,1,3,5 February 2016
Detroit," Detroit
","The summer of 1967 brought not just the sweltering of the summer heat, but also a wave of unrest. One of the largest race riots in United States history came to a fever pitch in Detroit in 1967. Detroit had begun to rebel in response to the racial tension between the city's largely African American population and the white police and their brutal treatment of the citizens of the city. Kathryn Bigelow helms an exploration of one evening in the city at the Algiers Motel which resulted in the deaths of three black men and the savage beating of nine others. The true story took place 50 years ago and one could only hope that would exist as a black mark on our nation's history and a past that we have learned from. Unfortunately, however, civil unrest and racial tensions are at an all-time high. This time, we also have a president who refuses to condemn the hateful actions of the individuals perpetrating such hate. Especially in the wake of the hate riots in Charlottesville over the weekend, it doesn't take much to realize that the united states are not as far removed from the tensions of 50 years ago. Not only are racial tensions at a tipping point in 2017, but so are religious tensions. I feel as though I am watching the world in a pre-WWII state. Islamaphobia is at an all time high, and with white supremacists canvassing the streets carrying flags with swastikas and giving the heil Hitler salute, it's certainly not a comfortable time to be a Jew. This bit of commentary is far off from the film Detroit other than to serve as a sad reminder that we no longer have to wonder what it was like to live in such volatile times because we are still experiencing them.Detroit opens with a history lesson told with an artistic touch of stop motion animation which covered hundreds of years in the span of minutes, a superb way to introduce the film. Blending actual footage of the time and footage filmed for production, Detroit packs a heavy punch giving audiences a dramatized understanding of what happened, while still providing an actual look at the historical context. Much of the filming is achieved using hand-held cameras which go a long way to add to the disorienting feeling of a time which so much carnage and turmoil took place. The audience is placed in the heart of the narrative giving the feeling of watching the documentary which is completely necessary in order to understand the struggle as much as possible.The true strength of this film lies in its narrative structure. Clear moods are established in each act of the film. The first act is made up of a largely episodic narrative in which we see many struggles across the city without one protagonist being clearly identified. This structure allows for both the idea of togetherness and isolation. You see how different people are affected by the same racial unrest which goes to show that every citizen was vulnerable and each person of color a target. You also see just how isolated the city is from the rest of the world. When the National Guard is called in and you see even federal agents stepping aside to let them deal with their 'state issue' one can truly see just how helpless the citizens were. The frenetic camera movement and drastic angles lend to the desperation in the atmosphere at the time. A minor detail is the excellent attention paid to period detail throughout the film. A film as strong and important as Detroit is certainly going to be remembered for other aspects than this, but it does excel in period design. My only complaint is that the film is a bit heavy-handed in some of its symbolism, I much prefer the subtle touch, and trusting the audience, but this is a small quibble in relation to the film. My only other complaint is that the film was a bit long and could have benefited from more aggressive editing, some nightmares are best- shown bits at a time in order to drive home the impact, and the systematic killing that took place in this film is one such nightmare. Audiences need to know that this happened, and I'm not suggesting to spare us from the truth, but some cutting could have better painted the picture. Detroit is my favorite film to come out of 2017, and I despise making such statements with so much of the year left, but Detroit is a film that should not be missed.",9,3,11,13 August 2017
Chinatown," Chinatown
","Isolation, corruption of police, turning a profit on natural resources, each issue is tackled in brilliant form in the 1974 film by Roman Polanski. Dealing with his own internal turmoil near the time of filming, Polanski opted not for the happy ending screenwriter Robert Towne wanted and fought for, but instead the brutality of real life. Sometimes people die who are not supposed to, and oftentimes, things don't work out as they should and people are worse off than they began. I'm a humanist and a fan of humanistic films (I'm gazing at you, Francois Truffaut) so I appreciate when a film forgoes the ending tying everything up with a bow and opts for the realism that often leaves life less neat than we would like. Chinatown takes place in Los Angeles in 1937 where J.J. Gittes, a private eye is hired to find out if a husband is cheating on his wife. Jake soon realizes he is tailing a powerful man and gets pulled into a web of money and politics he could never have anticipated. Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and legendary John Huston, Chinatown is a perfect neo-noir, so perfect in fact that lines are often blurred and the film is often referred to as a noir rather than a neo-noir. Chinatown came out over 40 years ago in one of the very best years of American cinema and has persisted as a pinnacle of cinematic art.J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private eye in L.A. who usually handles cases regarding philandering spouses and uses any means necessary to close his cases. Gittes also gains most of his business via what's printed about him in the newspapers, so he's no stranger to bringing publicity upon himself. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) seeks the help of Gittes due to her fear that her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling) is having an affair. Hollis is the Commissioner and Chief Engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power which means he has quickly become one of the most powerful and influential politicians in the area due to the chronic drought experienced in the Los Angeles area. Gittes doesn't let Mulwray get too far away from him following him as he attends commission meetings and to various reservoirs, aqueducts, dams and waterways. Jake does eventually snap a photo of Hollis Mulwray with another woman. When the story makes the front page of the paper, Gittes is visited by the real Mrs. Mulwray threatening to sue Gittes. With his reputation at stake, Gittes is eager to talk to the real Mr. Mulwray but the Mulwrays are reluctant to talk to him until Mrs. Mulwray finally talks to Gittes and agrees to drop the lawsuit. When Gittes is persistent in speaking to Hollis, Evelyn finally suggests that Gittes tries to locate him at the Oak Pass at Stone Canyon Reservoir. Gittes does find him there, along with the police as he has been killed. Evelyn covers for Jake being at the reservoir so he is not implicated in Hollis's murder. Jake's interest in Evelyn has been piqued, and she is strongly drawn to him, as well. The relationship between the pair grows and leads them down roads of scandal and corruption Jake could have never imagined. From the beginning, Chinatown is a perfect noir. From the font of the credits to the emanating score, Chinatown proves its roots in neo- noir. Polanski's brilliant direction is clear from the beginning as he pays brilliant homage to classic noir films with his apt camera work. There is a zoom shot into the rear-view mirror of Jakes car that is the stuff dreams are made of. We also see a brilliant shot through a pair of binoculars Jake is gazing through creating a captivating view into Jake's work. The perfectly haunting score throughout the film is only eclipsed by the brilliant flawless camera movement. Dunaway leaves no doubt that she is the film's siren as she clumsily reaches for a cigarette only to be reminded by Jake that she's 'already got one going'. The screenplay is incredible, and the interactions between characters are truly divine to experience. John Huston, screen legend, is intensely engaging in his role as land baron Noah Cross. Despite the biblical inspiration of his name, Noah seeks to keep water from surrounding land in order to irrigate it and sell the land he buys at a reduced rate; Huston encapsulates an evil in the guise of overt niceness like no one else could have done. The isolation and loneliness of Gittes are the film's shining takeaway. Reminiscent, probably, of the isolation director Roman Polanski felt just before he fled the country, Gittes is always searching for truth, but even when he finds it, nothing can be done because corruption rules the city. Gittes is no angel, of course, often employing illegal means to close his cases, really drives home the idea that the world is full of gray areas and we are but mere pawns to a system few of us get to actively participate in.",10,4,8,4 May 2017
Erin Brockovich," Erin Brockovich
","As much as I try, and as much as I appreciate the movies she's in and the roles she takes on, I am simply not a fan of Julia Roberts'. Steven Soderbergh's 2002 feature Erin Brockovich was another good role for the star Roberts, but just one I couldn't sink my teeth into. Along with Roberts, Albert Finney also stars as the unlikely duo that brings down a multi-million dollar water corporation. The story of a single mother of three who will stop at nothing to provide for her kids and the vulnerable people she encounters is one that has settled into the hearts of audiences years after its release.Single mother, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is unemployed and desperate for a job. When she unsuccessfully pursues an insurance claim in which she was hit, she stumbles upon the notion that she could start working at the legal office that was chosen to represent her. Thankfully for Erin, she encounters Ed Masry, an overworked kind-hearted lawyer that gives Erin a chance to work for his law office. Ostracized from the office for her revealing wardrobe, Erin must learn the ropes of the law office herself, having no legal background or experience. Throughout her research, Erin stumbles upon many inconsistencies in retail deeds and health records. Once she is granted permission from Ed to further investigate the inconsistencies, Erin uncovers that powerful California water company, PG&E have been dumping toxic chemicals into the ground water sources in Hinkley California. When more and more residents are diagnosed with illnesses corresponding with the effects of the chemical being dumped into the water source, Erin brings the issues to Ed's attention and the two voraciously go after the water company, resulting in the largest class-action lawsuits in American history, at the time. Nothing too innovative happens throughout the film, Erin Brockovich, and it doesn't have to, the story is compelling enough to drive the issue for the audience. I wish I could have seen this movie before the water crisis in Flint, Michigan; I think I have been desensitized to the thought that financial gain could encourage a corporation to poison a water supply. Regardless, this film portrays a nice David v. Goliath where we get to see an endearing couple of Davids beat the monster.",5,1,3,17 May 2016
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","At some point in their journey through film, every lover of cinema will attempt to critically evaluate Citizen Kane. The pantheon of film, Citizen Kane has, maybe the most prominent place in film history consistently topping lists as the best film of all-time. Starring Orson Welles in the titular role, alongside Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead, Citizen Kane follows the journey of a team of newspaper reporters desperate to find out the meaning of a powerful man's dying word. A technical wonder for the time it was made, and beyond, Citizen Kane has stood the test of time due to its gorgeous cinematography and boldly innovative camera work, blocking, and lighting. Admired and appreciated as a blueprint for an innumerable amount of films that came after it, Citizen Kane is not only a technical marvel but an ambitious project for the untested director, Welles, who was only 25 at the time of the film's production. What amounted to Welles' magnum opus, Citizen Kane is a film that's hard to top in technical achievement.Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top after his family struck it rich in mining resulting in Kane being sent away by his parents to a boarding school in care of the bank until he was old enough to be awarded his share. His mother thought it best that the bank raise him and position him for a life better than their country sensibilities would be able to provide. Once he turned 25, Kane gained access to his fortune and immediately bought a newspaper. Kane sought to not only seize the means by which people learned their news, but to seize the news itself. Kane wanted to control everything around him and shape events so they fit his world view. Despite his wealth and power, Kane lived an internally solitary life. The more papers he bought and the power he amassed, the more alone he became. Despite two marriages, Kane never fills the void he needed to fill with the people around him. Never quite realizing that his void also couldn't be filled with money, Kane meanders through life with his only goal seeming to be gaining influence. When the death of Charles Foster Kane stuns the world, it is his dying word 'Rosebud' that captures attention. A team of reporters begins a journey to discover what rosebud meant to Kane by interviewing the people who took part in his life. By attempting to uncover the meaning of a powerful man's dying word, the reporters are granted intimate access to the life of Charles Foster Kane, a life that was as much of an enigma once more was revealed as it was when it was kept a secret.It's been said many times before that Citizen Kane was a technological feat for the ages, and that statement rings true. It's self-evident that Orson Welles took bold chances and used lighting, blocking, and camera techniques scarcely used before his creation of Citizen Kane. As incredible as nearly every shot in the film is, I'll avoid redundancy by only highlighting the shots that really knocked me over, figuratively. There is a heavy reliance upon glass throughout the film which I found extraordinary. Mirrors and windows play a huge role in the film, with Welles himself usually being framed by a window or looking through one. The most notable shot in the film and one of the most remembered shots in cinema history takes place with Charles Foster Kane, as a child, playing outside in the snow while his parents talk with a bank representative about where Kane is going to be sent. There is an exceptionally wonderful use of foreground, middle ground, and background as the audience sees Kane, framed by a window, with his mother banker and father comprising the rest of the shot. Everyone knows the shot, it's gorgeous, and a technical feat for anyone, especially the fledgling director Welles was. Another fantastic window shot shows Kane talking to his friend and confidant Jedediah Leland about his hopes to buy more and more papers and increase circulation at each one of the papers he owns. Kane looks through the window with a childlike excitement written on his face energized by the idea of being someone important and influencing the very members of the community he sees from his window. This scene is powerful in illustrating Kane's desire to wield influence and shows the power of the window he is looking out from as both a way to see those around him and Kane himself. Another powerful scene involving windows shows Kane framed in a window while going over more plans with his associates to increase his paper's circulations. Kane is again seen with emboldened confidence, yet he has the naivety of a child, wanting respect and praise, and seeming eager to please those around him. Once again at the office, just after Kane has bought another paper, we see his reflection in the window dancing along with a party he has thrown in celebration of his monetary investments. Jedediah is seen in the frame discussing whether or not Kane is making positive investments and if he will be able to keep up his current pace. This scene is powerful because we see such jubilation from Kane's reflection that appears ominous due to the camera angle with which the audience sees it. because the camera is positioned chest level with Jedediah, Kane's reflection is behind him, leaving the audience to wonder how long Kane's happiness will last. The power of the window in this scene leaves the audience wondering if happiness is something that is only in the past tense of Kane's life.",10,1,4,9 March 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Inglourious Basterds
","'I do believe this is my masterpiece'The final line spoken by Brad Pitt in the 2009 film, Inglourious Basterds is one I have often hoped was a declaration of director Quentin Tarantino's. I do believe Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's masterpiece, excelling his 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, and his 1994 classic Pulp Fiction. The script is airtight with every line of dialogue having a purpose. Starring Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz-- in an American breakout performance for the ages, Inglourious Basterds exceeds the film mastery audiences have grown to expect from Tarantino.Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) has found a home in German- occupied France harboring Jews in 1941. Landa slaughters the family with the exception of young Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) who is able to escape. Shosanna vows to get revenge against Germany and bides her time plotting after her escape. Three years later, the cinema she owns is selected to host an illustrious movie premiere to honor German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). Zoller immediately takes a liking to Shosanna, convincing Hitler (Martin Wuttke) through his reservations about the venue. Shosanna isn't the only one plotting a massacre at the movie premiere, however. Unbeknownst to her, a group of Jewish- American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine also have a plan for a massacre at the cinema the night of the premiere. The group who does one thing only 'kill nazi's' have developed a plan with German movie star Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to sneak explosives and artillery into the cinema which will be filled with German military and the high command. The two plans are developed, independently of each other, ensuring that, one way or another, Hitler will meet his demise on the night of the premiere.I am, unashamedly so, a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's. He's one of, if not the best, modern dialogue writers, in my estimation. A script carries a film, and if the script is good, the film will usually be good, as well. No one writes dialogue like Tarantino, with the notable exception of Woody Allen. The other unique thing about Tarantino is his lack of formal film schooling or training. Tarantino never went to film school, yet amassed a wealth of film knowledge from reading an extensive amount of film history, and screenplays. Every Tarantino film is riddled with bits of film history throughout the film, making his movies a cinephile's dream. Film scores are also incredibly important to Tarantino and pivotal to his films. He is able to arrange a film score that seems like it doesn't work, only to reveal that it's perfect. I could spend decades writing about how riveting the interrogation scenes are in Inglourious Basterds, solely due to the fine script, or I could spend an equal length of time talking about how many plot points Tarantino brings seamlessly together by the film's end; Inglourious Basterds, however, is simply a film that begs to be seen and experienced first hand. The lighting, the nods to classic cinema, and every Tarantino-esque moment comes together perfectly creating a film that will be difficult for the director to top.",10,2,6,30 January 2017
Shakespeare in Love," 'We haven't the time to talk in prose'
","The 1998 Best Picture Winner, Shakespeare in Love has suffered from the 'didn't deserve it' curse. Sometimes, a movie is remembered not on its own merits, but on what it beat out for Oscar's top prize. I have been guilty of this before as well; it took me until I was 27 years old to see Forrest Gump because I was so distraught at the fact that it beat out Pulp Fiction and Network for Best Picture. I've tried not to put movies in this purgatory anymore, but it still happens. For instance, I hardly ever meet someone who has seen How Green Was My Valley, yet I meet a lot of people who scoff that John Ford's magical piece beat out Citizen Kane in the eyes of the Academy. John Madden's feature, starring Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, and Gwyneth Paltrow is not immune to this phenomenon. Unfortunately, Shakespeare in Love, the story of the Bard finding his muse and writing his most revered play, is more remembered as the bandit that stole Best Picture from Saving Private Ryan. A struggling poet and amateur playwright, Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is grappling with a severe case of writer's block. Having already sold a play to theater operator Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), he is racing against the deadline of opening night to have something to give to both the operator of the theater and the audience. He needs the love of a woman to inspire him to write the romance expected of him, but every attempt to find her has proved futile. Meanwhile, Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) a beautiful admirer of theater and fan of Shakespeare's wants nothing more than to act. Since only men are allowed to act in theater, Viola takes on the identity of a fictitious Thomas Kent, dresses as a man, and auditions and is accepted for a part in Shakespeare's next play. Wil sees through her ruse and falls in love with the woman behind the mustache. The two begin a love affair tainted with the knowledge that Wil is married, and Viola has been promised to Lord Wessex. Eventually realizing their union will never endure, the two go on, promising to forever love the other. Viola enters her marriage to Lord Wessex; Wil, finally attaining his muse, goes on to write his next play. The true treat of this film is its screenplay. This clever, well- written script will have you roped in from the first scene. Marc Norman, Tom Stoppard deserve accolades and were totally deserving for their statuettes for Best Original Screenplay. Aside from how well it was written, the story is very interesting as well. Even though Shakespeare's works are read in high schools throughout the world, very little thought is put into the love life of the man behind the great romances. Costumes were another brilliant treat from this film. Granted, it seems as though period pieces always take home top prize from the Academy, there was the added pressure of also designing costumes to be used as costumes, as much of the scenes comprised of the actors rehearsing the play Shakespeare was writing. Every garment worn by the actors looked uniquely Victorian and produced a well-deserved gold statuette for costume designer Sandy Powell. This film, much like the English Patient, deserves to be viewed on its own merit, and accepted as a fine piece of filmmaking, regardless of the other films that came out the same year. Shakespeare in Love is a drama and a romance but never gets bogged down by either genre. There are playful moments abound within the film, making it all the more engaging for the audience. My favorite scene of this nature takes place in a bar; Wil is depressed over his writer's block and bumps into revered playwright Christopher Marlowe who gives Shakespeare advice for his play. The authorship of works credited to Shakespeare is heavily debated in some circles with many, myself included believing Marlowe to be the true author. It was a fun nod the film took to recognize this and incorporate it into the film. What was also fun was the repeated allusions throughout the film to other works of Shakespeare's, most notably Twelfth Night. Being a fan of works attributed to Shakespeare it was fun to see these nods within the film; these allusions also made it easier to forgive the historical inaccuracies wrought throughout the film as well. Shakespeare in Love is a fun look at the inner workings of possibly the most famous playwright to have ever lived. The film is beautiful to watch and captivating due to the exceptional screenplay and costumes. I urge audiences to view Shakespeare in Love, on its own merits; I wager you will be pleasantly surprised. Shakespeare in Love is so much more than 'the film that beat Saving Private Ryan'. If given the chance, audiences will fall in love with Shakespeare in Love.",9,1,1,25 March 2016
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men
","I wonder what it must have been like for Sidney Lumet to direct a perfect film for his feature film debut. Lumet had worked on television shows before directing his 1957 film 12 Angry Men, a debut film examining justice and the motivation behind people's actions and the motivation behind their decisions when a group of jurors decides whether to convict a young man of a murder that would result in his being sentenced to death. First developed for a CBS Studio One anthology television series, Reginald Rose wrote 12 Angry Men and developed it into a teleplay in 1954. Lumet's version is still thought of by many as a perfect film 60 years after its release. With an all-star cast including Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman among others, 12 Angry Men is my personal favorite film to watch when I want to see a collection of the best acting talent. What I wouldn't give to have been in the theatres during the first run of 12 Angry Men. I can only imagine the audience reaction to such a powerful yet understated film. Alas, I was born in the wrong time and instead of being able to head to the cinema and see 12 Angry Men, I'm here buying tickets for The Emoji Movie.A desperate teenager is seen staring longingly at the men who just heard his case exiting the jury stall. He knows they will be the ones deciding his fate. The young man is on trial for the murder of his father, and if convicted, will face the death penalty. From the outside, his case looks open and shut. He had an argument with his father that was overheard by neighbors, he owned a knife which was the same weapon used to kill his father, and he had previous grievances with the law. Most of the jurors file into their sequestered room assuming they won't be in long, as the verdict seems clear. One juror, however, has doubts and refuses to cast a vote for guilty without at least discussing the case as they've been assigned to do. Begrudgingly the jurors begin to discuss the case sure that their minds won't be changed. One by one, however. further examination of the evidence and the factors involved in the case reveal the motivations each man had used to inform their decision was less based on evidence and more so on their own biases. An exploration of the human psyche and what motivates our thought processes, 12 Angry Men has more than earned its place as one of American cinema's best.The opening credit sequence of 12 Angry Men was a divine long shot, achieved at a high-angle through a fan, that would provide a source of tension throughout the film, of each of the jurors filing into the room preparing to see to the matters of the case. After their opening vote reveals only one holdout, mob mentality takes over as a few vocal members of the majority intend on proving to Henry Fonda's juror #8 why their view on the matter is more accurate than his. In doing so, they also reveal their biases and the different factors driving their decision. Whether it's the lonely brokenness of a severed relationship or attempting to assert dominance to shield one's own powerlessness, each man is operating with far more than the facts of the case driving them. The lengths Lumet went to conceal the names of the jurors was one of the best decisions he made to drive home the universality of the film's message. At one point, a court worker asks one of the jurors his name and he points to it on the clip board held by the court worker. In a typical situation, one would have just said their name out loud, but Lumet's stroke of brilliance avoided names being used through the entire runtime of the film allowing audiences the chance to see themselves in the characters depicted on screen. Whether we are aware or not, and whether we act on them or not, we are all driven by personal biases. We learn the set of biases that drive us as we mature, first from our immediate familial surroundings, then from the people we surround ourselves with and the circumstances we endure. If those biases are negative, it is our responsibility to analyze them and see that we eradicate them. As a character study, 12 Angry Men is top- notch with no small thanks owed to the exceptional cast. Every single name on the credits list is that of a well-established actor of the time. Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and Henry Fonda are only half the cast and each known by an extensive body of work. One exceptional aspect, which also points to Lumet's directorial prowess he possessed even from his feature film debut is how improbable it is that this film would be such a success. One-setting films with small casts and rich in dialogue are not the easiest films to pull off, yet you'd be hard- pressed to find someone who won't give accolades to 12 Angry Men. Not once through the runtime is the film static nor does it lose the engagement of the audience. Lumet ends the film in a sensational way, as well. When Fonda helps Cobb with his coat after the two were the fiercest of adversaries during deliberations, Lumet communicated to the audience that we are all capable of seeing past what initially drives our motives and can possibly overcome them and come together on the other side. Then, just before the film ends, we learn Fonda's name and see he and another juror uncomfortably stand on the courthouse steps not knowing what to say to one another. Despite having gone through an emotional afternoon together, they don't know each other and don't have much to say to one another.",10,0,0,3 August 2017
The English Patient," 'I really ought to drag myself outside, but then there'd be the sun.'
","The English Patient is proof that films should be judged on merit and content alone, rather than on how the public perceives them. I feel very much the same about this film as I do about How Green Was My Valley; audiences love to trash that film because it beat out Citizen Kane for Best Picture in 1941. Citizen Kane was an astounding movie; so much about knowledge about filmmaking was expressed through that film that directors still use today. Citizen Kane is often touted as the best movie of all time and constantly listed as prominent actor and director's favorite films, providing a source of inspiration. As good as Citizen Kane is, and I agree that it's phenomenal, so is How Green Was My Valley. I have exactly this same kinship to The English Patient. I have heard many people express disdain for this film for a variety of reasons, namely, though, for beating Fargo for best picture in 1996. I have yet to see Fargo, however, The English Patient starring Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, and Kristin Scott Thomas was a sensational film directed by Anthony Minghella, and more than deserving of every award it received from the Academy.The English Patient opens in 1944 in war-torn Italy. Hanna (Juliette Binoche) is a nurse working in a mobile medical unit who truly puts her heart in her work, yet, unfortunately, watches many of the patients that she grows attached to succumb to their wounds. Traveling along the treacherous land heavily armed with explosives, Hanna volunteers to stay behind in an abandoned church to care for a dying Englishman, Count Laszlo de Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) badly burned, and partially amnesiac. It is just the two of them until a Canadian member of the Intelligence Service arrives. The Canadian, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), is certain he knows who the burned patient is and believes he has cooperated with the Germans. David believes the patient's amnesia is a farce, and rather that he is running from his past. After the accusation, the patient begins to open up about his past and reveal his struggles. A beautiful story of love amongst so much hate begins to unfold and the audience is fortunate enough to be along for the ride.There are so many wonderful things about this film, I don't even know where to begin. The cinematography in this film is something to treasure. Beautiful shots of desert landscape make wonderful art for the audience to enjoy. The film is scored so subtly and beautifully you nearly forget there's a score until you hear the music at precisely the right time in the film. The storytelling in this film was also exceptionally well-done. I quite enjoy stories told largely through flashbacks. Witnessing the two parallel lives play out on screen was a great experience and added a lot of depth to the film; especially considering how well-done the director accomplished the feat. The pacing and character development were well-executed, keeping the audience engrossed through the final scene. With so many superb aspects of this film, it is a true disappointment that more people don't give The English Patient a viewing.I reserve the final section of my reviews for audiences I would recommend this film to, but I don't know of anyone that wouldn't gain something from this film. The English Patient was such a remarkable film and doesn't get the credit it deserves so I would love for anyone to watch it at least once. I've plum run out of adjectives to describe how great of an experience this was. I was not expecting to get anything out of this film before I watched it and I am so glad to report that I couldn't have been more wrong. If you're not busy tonight, and you don't mind investing nearly 3 hours, do yourself a favor and watch The English Patient.",10,1,1,18 February 2016
The Babadook," The Babadook
","Horror movies are tough. Genre enthusiasts seem to constantly be reminiscing about the old days while new fans are enthralled with what they see, occasionally ignorant to what came before. The Babadook, the 2014 film by Jennifer Kent was heralded by many as the best horror film of 2014. As a horror enthusiast, I was excited to see the 'new take on horror' that people were calling The Babadook. After my first viewing of The Babadook, I was simply disappointed, the more I thought about the film, however, the more I began to actively dislike it. The film stars Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as a mother and son team who rely on each other as the only family they have left when suddenly their lives are interrupted by an evil spirit who seeks to possess those it comes into contact with. 'This premise of two people solely reliant upon each other who then have to deal with a possession sounds a bit like Rosemary's Baby,' I thought to myself, making me even more eager to begin the film. I was wrong--so very wrong, and although I hesitate to say anyone else was wrong who called this a 'new' horror film, I definitely don't see the hype surrounding it. I found The Babadook to not only be a poor excuse for a horror movie--it really never picks a genre, and that's fine but a film calling itself a horror movie should be, but a poor film altogether. Just add this one to the list of films I don't understand their widespread appeal.Amelia (Essie Davis) is drudging through life as a single mother to her only son after losing her husband in a car accident on the day her son was born on the way to the hospital. Emotional exhaustion and depression has seemed to take over Amelia's life. Despite her dismal existence, she seems content to live in her somber solitude refusing to make plans or leave the house much. Amelia's son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is a large part of why they never leave the house; he has managed to ostracize all those around him, including his aunt and cousin with his behavior. Samuel makes weapons and takes them out of the house, he yells and screams, and is odd and unpleasant to be around. Despite his many behavior problems at school, Amelia always takes his side against authorities because Samuel knows exactly when to act affectionate towards his mother, manipulating her at every turn. Once Samuel is kicked out of another school, again, Amelia is at the end of her rope and decides to keep him home for awhile while trying to find another school for him to attend. One night before bed, Amelia reads Samuel a book she has never seen before about a monster. Unsettled after reading such a book, Amelia begins to find traces of the supernatural monster in her home. Initially refusing to believe in a spirit possessing her home, Amelia eventually realizes The Babadook has entered she and her son's lives and is refusing to leave. 'A psychological horror about a single mother who becomes possessed by a monster that wills her to kill her 6-year old son.' That's how The Babadook was described on its own Kickstarter page, that's not what was delivered to the audience, however. I fail to see the psychological horror element of the film, and that is my favorite horror sub-genre. What was psychological was the fact that more than a horror film, The Babadook is a case study on how debilitating PTSD can be. Another struggle I have is that the Babadook is only in half the film. I prefer a director shows rather than tells, so it's not a problem on its own that we rarely see the monster in this film, as long as we are given the atmosphere of the monster. The problem is, instead of a monster's presence being established all we really get is a series of uncomfortable situations that could easily have been the doing of Amelia's out of control child. The Babadook more clearly exists as a family drama showing the deeply engrained problems between a mother and her son. The relationship between Amelia and Samuel is toxic, abusive, and enabling. The two share almost no mutual respect for each other, as they are each entrenched in their own life position to actively participate in the lives of each other. Amelia is run down, as single mothers often are, but to never accept or seek help for her son's defiance is digging her own overwhelmed grave. Despite being heralded as a unique take on horror, there seems to exist little evidence of such. The look of The Babadook appears to be the love child of Nosferatu and Freddy Krueger, so nothing new there. In fact, seeing the Babadook proves to be thoroughly underwhelming. Some horror standbys are utilized such as the fully-clothed bath, the flickering electricity, and the dog being able to 'sense' the demonic presence in the air. The nursery rhyme score has also run its rounds in the horror genre. The atmosphere said to be created throughout the film appears to borrow from German expressionism, but the bleak colors aren't enough to caputre that style, nor do they add to the atmosphere of the film, they simply make the picture dull. With no character enjoying an arc to their story, without any standout performances, and devoid of any real scares from a largely absent 'monster', I certainly hope this isn't what horror as a genre has devolved into.",1,5,12,7 April 2017
Elizabeth," Elizabeth
","A reunion, of sorts, for Shakespeare in Love actors Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes, Shekhar Kapur's 1998 epic combines their talents along with Cate Blanchett's in the film Elizabeth. Telling the story of the turbulent events leading to Queen Elizabeth's rise to power and outlining the origin of the Catholic against Protestant war in Europe, Kapur's film brings to life the beginning of the Golden Age of England. Highlighting the magnitude of internal struggle one person undertakes to lead a nation, Elizabeth is a captivating story of struggle and triumph. Being born out of wedlock to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) never expected to rise to power, but the reality of her childless sister Mary I (Fanny Ardant) dying with no heir made Elizabeth's rise the only possibility. Crippled with fear that Protestant Elizabeth would un-do Catholic reign and bring Protestantism to England. While trying to learn about and establish her monarchy, Elizabeth is aided, sometimes, by a team of advisers. Where many of the advisers have good intentions, some are there plotting to restore the Catholic line, refusing to pledge allegiance to the new queen. Another difficulty for Elizabeth is the immense pressure on her to marry and produce an heir. Her longtime lover Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) is not viewed as an acceptable choice, and once Elizabeth learns that he has been carrying on an affair with her against his wife, she never speaks to him again. Elizabeth traverses the difficulties of her new reign with grace while she decides which of her advisers to keep and which to ignore all the while building an empire. Cate Blanchett is exceptional as ever playing the meek turned mighty Queen Elizabeth. She handles the difficulties of playing a woman thrust into power no one wants her to have, yet still trying to do the best for England phenomenally. She also switches from love to scorn for Robert Dudley in a believable way. The production design on this film was fantastic, so intricate and detailed one feels as though they are truly watching the royals interact. The costuming was also beautiful in this film. I greatly admire period pieces that don't take the easy/cheap way out with simple costuming. For instance, the bird's eye view shot of Queen Elizabeth's first appearance from the throne was brilliantly overtaken by her gorgeous red velvet dress. A wonderful directorial choice made by Shekhar Kapur was to show Elizabeth's transfer to power with bright white flashes of light, illustrating the drastic transformation she, and the rest of England were about to endure. Another directorial choice that added to the depth of the film was the flashback of Elizabeth's trials and troubles near the ending scene. While the film loses some of its luster and struggles with pacing in the middle of the movie, it rebounds with a strong enough beginning that one doesn't mind waiting to get re-engaged into the story. Class and sexuality are huge focal points in this film. Sexuality is under the microscope when many men doubt Elizabeth's abilities to govern as a woman. Sexuality is also an overarching issue when it comes to marrying off Elizabeth and producing an heir, as that is the primary focus of women in the 16th century. Class and nobility are central issues as well, with Elizabeth's longtime lover not being seen as regal enough to marry a queen. There is also a certain expectation of forthcoming change Elizabeth is expected to make once she takes the throne; she must be viewed as a royal and forgo peon activities. Elizabeth is a wonderful period piece and a display of directorial force from Shekhar Kapur, whose work I have not familiarized myself with.",8,0,0,28 April 2016
Ed Wood," Ed Wood
","Tim Burton was two strikes deep on my cinematic experience with him. After seeing, and not caring for, Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd, I was ready to give Burton one last chance before writing him off, completely. Good thing I used Ed Wood for his third strike. An engrossing, thoroughly engaging biopic, Ed Wood tells the story of the famously horrible, yet passionate, film director, Edward D. Wood Jr. Edward D. Wood Jr. has famously been named the worst director of all time, responsible for such films as Plan 9 From Outer Space. Somehow, Burton took a genre, known for its tedious approach and formulaic output, and made an interesting film about a largely unexplored figure. Ed Wood, made in 1994 stars Johnny Depp, as most Tim Burton films do, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette. Burton and Depp put in career best output in a film that was clearly close to Burton's heart.Edward D. Wood Jr (Johnny Depp) is a Hollywood eccentric who enjoys wearing women's clothing and has even admitted to wearing women's undergarments under his uniform when he served in the military. Ed has a passion for 'telling stories' and wants to follow in the massive footsteps of his idol, Orson Welles. Through extreme passion, Wood is able to carve a place for himself in Hollywood, backed by a loyal crew and accompanied by a star who has dimmed, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). The problem with the story-telling of Ed Wood, is that his dreams are too great for what can reasonably be placed on celluloid, especially given the small budget Wood had to work with. Despite ever gaining any commercial or critical success, Wood held tight to his dream, creating film after film that few audiences ever saw. His personal relationships were important to Wood, always remaining loyal to his friends and loved ones, despite their troubles, as his friends and loved ones remained loyal to him. An interesting life, worthy of delving into for film fans, Ed Wood is a good vehicle with which to begin the journey into Ed Wood Jr.I love black and white films, I instantly enjoy a film more when I see that it is in black and white. When a film is in black and white that doesn't have to be, I appreciate it all the more. It only makes sense for Ed Wood to be shot in black and white, covering a man who began his work in filmmaking career in the 1950's, but the fact that Burton was able to pull it off in 1994, speaks volumes to his commitment to the project. Burton also used fantastic classic cinema film techniques with the great iris in/pit shots. Burton clearly wanted to make a film that was as period-accurate as he could, and I appreciate his adherence to classic cinema. Burton also used low angle shots to an effective degree, much as he did in Edward Scissorhands, which are always nice to see. After seeing four Johnny Depp films this month, I am nearly certain that I don't care for him as an actor, but he was at a career-best in this film. Burton was also at the top of his game, possibly due to his passion for the project, giving audiences an engaging look into an ignored director largely lost like the films in his career.",9,2,2,21 February 2017
Spotlight," Spotlight waited too long to turn the light on
","Another 2015 big name ensemble piece, with a heavy storyline, Spotlight was sure to be a brilliant film, until it wasn't. Directed by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight brought together Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and Stanley Tucci to tell the true life story of how a writing team on the Boston Globe first broke the sex abuse scandal within the Catholic Church. As a Roman Catholic, I expected to be disgusted, saddened, and perhaps angry at the events that were to take place on screen. Instead, I was simply stricken by how badly scratched my favorite watch has become.Taking place within the confines of the overtly Catholic Boston, Massachusetts, any egregious claims against the Catholic Church is going to be outright denied and silenced. With the urging of a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), the premier investigative team of the Boston Globe's known as Spotlight, is propelled to examine the claims of sexual abuse against young boys at the hands of their priests. Coyly led by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), the team acts on the scarce archived clippings they have to see if there is anything to the allegations. Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), is the forceful hothead with the most screen time, clearly trying to settle his own score with the Catholic Church. Mike's constant contact with the tight-lipped lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), representing the victims, is strained as Garabedian reveals that he has sent material to the Boston Globe in the past and been ignored. Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), another member of the team makes headway interviewing victims and former priests discovering that one of the men who oversees a victim's support group has also, years before, sent information to the Globe only to be ignored. The obvious resistance to the story from the community does not remain outside the Globe's walls. Through an intense scene of dialogue between the writers and editors, Robby reveals that it was he who ignored the information being sent to the Globe years before. Trying to make things right now, Robby goes after all leads with a fierce intensity. As evidence mounts, the team is driven to expose what too many people are content in keeping a well-known secret.Typically, a film bogged down almost from the beginning by poor pacing, is going to be filled with rich dialogue. This is not the case for this film; Spotlight, is slow with very sparse, elementary dialogue throughout. Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci both give excellent performances (but when don't they?) Mark Ruffalo's Mike was insufferably overacted and took on far too many distracting nuisance, for instance, I know that Ruffalo can act in an entire movie only speaking through pursed lips. Rachel McAdams, who I tend to like watching, also tried too hard to be an investigative journalist, complete with spastic head movements and darting eyes, and forgot to be an actress. All of these intricacies that I'm sure the talented actors were using to lend realism to their characters were incredibly distracting and removed me from much of the film.It's difficult when you leave a film you were looking forward to and expected to enjoy and being disappointed. It's even more difficult when you are a fan of the snubbed Carol, unable to comprehend how a masterpiece was overlooked but the Academy found a place for Spotlight. This film is one that if you skip, you won't miss and probably won't be talked about again, unlike some of the other Best Picture nominees.",5,10,21,20 January 2016
Juno," Juno
","Diablo Cody penned an insanely well-written story of a sixteen-year- old individualist who becomes pregnant with her friend/crush in her 2007 film Juno. Directed by Jason Reitman and starring Ellen Page, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman; Juno is fantastically crafted with enough pop culture references to place it until the end of time. The uniqueness of each person is fostered and treasured through Juno, going to show that if you can find that one person to make you feel comfortable with being you, do whatever you can to be with them. After becoming pregnant with her best friend's baby, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is unable to go through with an abortion, so she begins seeking an adoptive family for her baby. After meeting with prospective parents Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Jason Bateman), the 'Pennysaver Loring's' Juno is convinced this is the family to raise her child. Over the course of her pregnancy, outlined by the changing Minnesota seasons which surround her, Juno grows close to Mark a commercial composer who is adjusting to prospective parenthood at a much slower rate than his eager wife Vanessa. Mark takes the opportunity of Juno's company to indulge in some of his interests and hobbies that had been suppressed since his marriage. The more he listens to his old music and plays music, the more hesitant he is to tie himself down and father a child. The changes in Mark and Vanessa's relationship becomes difficult for the two of them to handle. Juno's many changes create difficulty in her life as well, as she watches her friends enjoy prom and high school life, oblivious to the adult issues Juno must face as a pregnant teenager. Each person has been injected into the lives of those around them for a purpose, and it is up to each of them to find that purpose and grow through the transformation thrust upon them. The opening scene showing where it all started, with a chair, instantly shows the audience what type of film they will be in for. Then, the opening credits shown through animation create a beautiful glimpse into the type of moving art placed before the audience. One can see after the first 10 minutes of the film that its shining star is its script. Not enough good can be said about Diablo Cody's witty pop culture laden beauty of a screenplay. Juno is a fantastic ensemble piece that is so much better, by the way, now that I have had more exposure to the supporting cast. Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are incredible standouts in the film, even more now that I have enjoyed Janney in The West Wing and Simmons in Whiplash. The music and wardrobe in this film are top notch and fit with the realism of Juno's world perfectly. A movie centered around pregnancy is perfectly outlined by the changing seasons, an excellent decision on the part of director Jason Reitman. But not only Juno was changing, Mark was also going through changing seasons of his life as he was intimidated to let go of his past, and Vanessa as she was looking forward to spring into motherhood. An exceptional and underrated film, Juno is just as good 8 years removed from its release as it was the night I saw it in theaters. Motherhood comes in many forms. Juno knew she was 'ill-equipped' to become a mother at the stage in her life when she became pregnant. She also knew that since she was unable to go through with an abortion that she could bless the life of another with her baby. In the least sentimental way possible, Juno traverses the struggles of unplanned teenage pregnancy. Vanessa's supreme wish in life is to become pregnant when she is unable to, and after a failed previous attempt at adoption due to Mark's 'cold feet', Vanessa is more determined than ever to become a mother. The conclusion of the film with Juno reflecting upon the notion that Vanessa was always the mother of her child was strikingly powerful, proving that motherhood s not exclusive to those that give birth.",9,2,2,1 June 2016
Match Point," Match Point
","The idea that much of a person's life is determined simply by chance is an idea that one often wants to ignore. We plan too much, make too many decisions, and have too much control to consider the fact that to a large degree our fate is out of our hands. Woody Allen explores fate and chance in an incredible way in his 2005 film Match Point. Both written and directed by the auteur, Match Point represents a departure for Woody Allen as the first of his films to be shot in London, contain no Woody Allen character, and is the first thriller-type film for the constant genre hopper. There is no such thing as a typical Woody Allen film, I've gone to great lengths to dispel that notion and now seeing 40 of his films in a row, I will never be convinced that he is as one-dimensional as he is often accused. Match Point stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson as two individuals who are desperate to enter the fold of the wealthy, so desperate in fact that they are willing to abandon their identities in order to achieve financial riches. A piercing look at the philosophical issues connected to morality and a scathing assessment of class-consciousness, Woody Allen lands on the right side of the net with Match Point.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a fish out of water in his new position as a tennis instructor at an upscale London tennis club. Previously earning a living as a professional tennis player, Chris couldn't accustom to the constant traveling and wished to find a place to call home. Raised by a modest family in Ireland, Chris believes he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the London elite. Desperate to fit in and leave his one-bedroom flat, Chris will do anything he needs to in order to come into more money. An opportunity arises when he begins providing lessons for wealthy club member Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Throughout the course of their lessons, Chris and Tom become friends and Chris meets Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who instantly finds herself attracted to Chris. Chloe has had an easy ride through life with more money than she's known where to spend and a father who will stop at nothing to make her happy, which essentially includes buying her a boyfriend. Chris is offered a job in one of Chloe's father's companies ensuring that his livelihood would be at stake if he were to ever leave Chloe. That knowledge doesn't stop Chris from becoming attracted to Tom's girlfriend Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) Nola is a struggling actress from America who is anxious to be brought into the fold of the aristocratic life. Nola, like many, doesn't want to struggle for money nor does she seem apt to put too much into her craft and would much rather marry into a good life. The passion Chris and Nola feel for each other is unable to be ignored and the two begin an affair, leaving Chris to decide if it is worth sacrificing the unfulfilled life that has been arranged for him to pursue the wild card that is Nola. Toto, we're not in New York anymore. Granted, this was not the first, nor would it be the last time Woody would shoot a film outside of New York but Woody Allen is synonymous in my mind with New York so it is always a shock for me to see a film of his in a different location. Match Point, like every Woody Allen film, has a brilliant opening monologue discussing the notion that most aspects of life are out of our control. The idea that we have no control over our lives brings about an interesting philosophical argument: If life is so meaningless we can't even control it, why not dismiss morality in order to give us the most pleasure. John Stuart Mill probably would have loved Match Point. There isn't a likable character that we ever see on screen, the audience is simply introduced to a host of people who exercise whatever means necessary to bring themselves the most pleasure. A brilliant bit of casting makes the audience wonder just what Chris is capable of from the first time we lay eyes on him. 'To never have been born may be the greatest boon of all', this Sophocles quote makes an appearance again in a Woody Allen film but is better explored through the plot of Match Point. Since we're here, we may as well make the best of this existence and those in the film certainly draw no lines while chasing their particular blends of happiness. In addition to the philosophy commonly explored in Woody Allen's films, he also opens fire against the conflict in classes that still exists today. Nola desperately wants to be on the same playing field as her boyfriend Tom, but all doors seem to be closed to that possibility due to her being below his social standing, a fact that both are constantly reminded of by Tom's mother. Social standings are such that no matter how happy Tom is with Nola, she will never be welcome, ultimately causing their separation. Woody Allen makes a fantastic film questioning life's big issues all the while taking a scathing look at the societal constraints affecting everyone. Match Point is certainly not to be missed simply because it isn't a 'funny one'.",9,1,1,27 July 2017
Midnight in Paris," Another Woody Allen Masterpiece!
","I dare anyone who says all of Woody Allen's later works are trash to watch Midnight in Paris and convince me it's not one of his best. Writing and directing, as always, Woody Allen made Midnight in Paris in 2011. Starring Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams, Allen examines one man's quest to feel at place in time in the world in which he doesn't feel like he belongs. When revisiting Midnight in Paris, it's one that I am astonished that I didn't own. Midnight in Paris is such an excellent film that perfectly captures the emotions of a man on the precipice of marriage, deciding if he has found the right person to spend his life with.Just before their wedding, Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) take a trip to Paris with Inez's parents. Gil, recently making the decision to shift from Hollywood screen writing to novel writing is inspired by the beauty and perfection that he sees in Paris. Inez is less than supportive of her husband's newfound love for The City of Lights, and would rather spend time with her friends Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda) who she bumps into, unaware that they were in the city, as well. Paul is a sanctimonious pseudo-intellectual who is constantly showing off with Inez eating out of his hand. Needing a break from Paul's flaunting, and Inez's worship of Paul, Gil takes a walk after a wine tasting and happens upon an interesting group that asks him to come along to a party with them. Gil is stunned to learn that he has slipped through a portal that leads him to Paris in the 1920's, the very time and place where Gil believes his soul belongs. Gil meets Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) and his notable editor Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) who begins to edit Gil's novel. He also meets F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo), T.S. Eliot (David Lowe), Salvador Dali (Adrian Brody), and Luis Bunuel (Adrien de Van), some of the most prolific people of the 1920's who spent time in Paris. Gil is captivated and completely absorbed by the allure of Paris in the '20's. He is racing through the days with his neglectful fiancé and can't wait for the nights when he goes back in time to his 'perfect' time. Through his journey, Gil realizes that Inez may not be the woman he wants to marry and that he must find a way to fit into the time period he was born in. Gil learns the valuable lesson that every successive generation romanticizes one that came before it, Gil learns this best by all of the artists and greats that he meets, many of which wish to live in a different time themselves. Gaining enough gumption to remain in the present and build the life he wants, Gil learns valuable lessons from all those he meets from the past, lessons which will impact the rest of his life.Woody Allen opens Midnight in Paris with the most beautiful montage of gorgeous images of Paris. I have never been a fan of Owen Wilson and was prepared to dislike him in the lead role of this film, but I found him to be perfectly cast for the role of Gil. The conversational dialogue over the opening credits was so perfectly Woody Allen and is fantastic in each of his films. Allen's scripts are in another world; he's talent for writing real dialogue full of emotion is simply incredible. The score in brilliant, a perfect mix of decades and genres creating a complete gift for the audience. The location filming was extraordinarily beautiful, of course, as Paris is. Allen completely nails the constant struggle some of us have, feeling as though we don't fit in the time we are born. Personally, I am a very old soul, and thusly feel terribly out of place among my peers. Midnight in Paris proves that even if I can't find my own portal to the past where I can freely spend time with Hemingway and Dali, I can make a suitable life for myself in the present, given that I can find the right people to surround myself with. Woody Allen put so much of himself into his screenplays and films, and I for one, am eternally grateful for that.",10,0,0,8 December 2016
Milk," Milk
","Gus Van Sant took on the crucially important subject matter of the openly gay activist who sought to give a voice to the oppressed with his 2008 film, Milk. Starring Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, and James Franco, Van Sant introduces audiences to Harvey Milk, who assembles the gay community and injects their ignored needs and rights into the political system. I was sure Milk was produced solely as Academy Award bait, and I could not have been more wrong or happier to be wrong. The 70's problems Milk discusses are in no way only a problem of the past making Milk as important to see today as it was in 2008.On his 40th Birthday, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) realizes that he doesn't have any accomplishments to his name and seeks to change that. Energized and supported by his great love, Scott Smith (James Franco), Harvey steps out of the closet of New York, where he is from, and moves to San Francisco's emerging gay community to start a business. Immediately feeling push back from some of the closed-minded neighboring realtors, Harvey decides to run for office in hopes to have a positive effect on the business and living restrictions forced upon gay members of the community. After two unsuccessful campaigns for a City Supervisor Board position, Harvey finally finds success and wins the election while amassing a large and vocal support base finally giving purchasing power to the repressed group. As the film spans Harvey's rise to politics, we also get to see his personal relationships mature and develop as his base grows. The audience also sees each new repressive measure unleashed by the masses in hopes to repress the gay community. A particular foe, Dan White (Josh Brolin), has trouble dealing with what he sees as a betrayal of Harvey on a measure he discussed with him that White believed would help the people of his district that Harvey was unable to support. White proves to be an unstable foe and will affect Milk's rise to power and the gay community in ways no one anticipated.Here is another backward narrative that I am so fond of. The film opens with Harvey narrating his history and letting the audience know what the end result is, but never making the revealed story anything less than engaging. Being a fan of technical aspects of a film, the most enjoyable part of the picture for me was what appeared to be a heavy reliance on hand-held cameras. Through most of the crowd scenes, it appears Van Sant used hand-held cameras to capture Harvey's activism. This was a brilliant decision by the director, allowing the audience to be as swept into the marching and protesting as the participants. There were also some excellent shots off reflective surfaces, as well. One shot that remains in the mind of the viewer is the one in which we see the body of a murdered man killed solely for his sexual identity reflected off the whistle he kept as the only measure of safety. Milk also flawlessly transitions between actual and filmed footage, a feat which often plagues a film. Sean Penn clearly immerses himself in the role, creating a wonderful characterization of the titular role. Milk neglects the safe route of being a film that is only made for Oscar fare and lasts as an important narrative that clearly addresses problems that still plague the nation today.",7,0,2,11 November 2016
The Hateful Eight," They're Red Apples..
","The eighth film from director Quentin Tarantino brings together his stock cast for a gruesome whodunit in the wide open Wyoming winter, just after the Civil War. The gang of eight is made up of Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), 'Hangman' John Ruth (Kurt Russell), Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), Bob (Demian Bichir), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), and O.B. (James Parks). After the script was leaked, Tarantino vowed not to make the film and turn to making one of the other projects in his reserves. I am more than happy that he changed his mind. As an avid Tarantino fan, I knew what I was getting into with this movie, although there were plenty of theatre goers who did not. Tarantino is an acquired taste, I'll concede that, but a taste that keeps on giving once one has gotten accustomed to it. Our story begins as we see a stagecoach, helmed by O.B., traversing an especially brutal blizzard. Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, has himself a take and is trying to make it to the city to collect his reward. Hoping for a ride, he meets John Ruth, a fellow bounty hunter, and his take, Daisy Domergue. Reluctantly, Ruth allows Major Warren to travel with them as they are attempting to make it to a mutual friends' haberdashery to wait out a couple of days of the fierce blizzard. Once they arrive, they see the haberdashery is being taken care of by unfamiliar faces. Bob is tending to the horses and the food and there are several travelers already inside. This unexpected setup doesn't sit well with the entrusting Warren and Ruth. After questioning the temporary inhabitants, Ruth and Warren are convinced something is amiss and distinguish themselves as the seekers of truth. Committed to finding out who among them is the rat working to ensure Ms. Daisy's release, a good old-fashioned whodunit emerges. In typical Tarantino fashion, a violent outcome ensues as the mystery unfolds, and the conclusion is nothing short of the tangled sort of web Quentin is so proficient at weaving.Again, it must be noted that I am a huge Tarantino fan. I tried my best to remain unbiased through this review, but that is extremely difficult. Tarantino is just a master at what he does. The camera usage in this film is incredible. There is a beautiful shot looking down on the group through rafters in the ceiling. Long shots abound in this film which remarkably captures the vast wilderness, as well as the subject on screen. One of my favorite moves was a lens change as Daisy was entertaining the group with a song. There was a pivotal scene unfolding in the background and Tarantino's shift of focus was like something out of a classic film; stunning. Tarantino's camera work is unrivaled by many modern day auteurs, and much the same could be said for his writing. A Tarantino stronghold is his excellent knack for writing dialogue. The script is very dialogue heavy, and coming in at over 3 hours, could have the effect of weighing down the film. But, because it's Tarantino, I never looked at my watch until the film was over and I was walking to the car. The scenes heavy with discussion are so intimate and riddled with relatable references that the audience just becomes immersed in the oratory. There are few directors like Tarantino who become so immersed in the research of their films. History buffs will be impressed by the realism in conversation achieved with the details described between characters. Tarantino thrives when one of his characters knows something no one else does. We've got one of those characters in this film and the careful, thoughtful interrogation in hopes of revealing the information is artful, to say the least. A five-star film from an outstanding director, Quentin Tarantino! This film is a must-see for fans of the auteur. I would suggest this film also to a student of film, as long as they can overcome the violence and gore. It is really something to see such crafty camera use come together on screen. I for one, certainly hope that The Hateful Eight is far from the last Tarantino film and that he gives us much more to enjoy, and keeps them on film!",9,3,21,4 January 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'I've got vision while the rest of the world has bifocals'
","What a treat this film turned out to be! First of all, credit must be given to the tremendous on-screen duo, Robert Redford and Paul Newman! Their chemistry was top notch, and a complete joy to watch from scene to scene. Now, to the film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid allows the audience to be a part of the Hole in the Wall gang, led by Butch Cassidy. Paul Newman's Butch comes through the screen as a fun- loving ham of a mischief maker in the Old West. He has no problem leading his gang of outlaws through bank holdups and train robberies, and he does so with ease given his disposition. What a performance from Paul Newman! His good-humored outlaw tops the critic's charts of performances, and I see why. Just watching his character makes the audience want to jump in and holster up for he and his gang. And where there is Butch Cassidy, you will also find the Sundance Kid. Butch's right hand man, Robert Redford's Sundance Kid is a stoic man's man, a perfect partner to Butch. Sundance is charged with keeping Butch's ideas mounted in realistic expectation, and keeping him focused; no doubt were these two large tasks, but Redford's Sundance Kid is the perfect character to manage both. This is one of the best on-screen duos I have ever seen! As we follow the gang through the story, we find out that, as the Wild West is becoming a bit less wild, there has been a special gang composed solely to bring about the downfall, deaths, of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. No matter how far they go, or how stealthily they travel, the appointed gang is never far behind. Another treat to the film is getting acquainted with Etta Place, played by Katharine Ross. We meet her in a compromising situation, and soon realize that Sundance has a sense of humor as well. There was no mistake that Etta was the Sundance Kid's girl, but the audience is left to wonder, as the chemistry between she and Butch is made apparent, if there were not a Jules and Jim type of agreement between the two of them regarding Etta. One will never know the full intricacies of the gang, we still enjoy a riveting story of outlaws trying to outrun their demise, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is remains forever, a classic. Technically, there is not enough good that can be said about this film. As it begins, the audience is introduced to the gang through a silent 'movie' being shown which really cements the notion of traveling into the past. The film also opens with an almost sepia colored wash over the film, then, after a run-in, we are greeted with a beautiful transition to full color so well done it was reminiscent of the transition in The Wizard of Oz. Brilliant camera work also accompanied the picture with wonderful shots of open plains and enough mountains to satisfy even this Colorado girl's heart! Certainly, no comprehensive review of this film would be complete without mention of its exquisite score. This score provides the perfect mix of songs for the perfect mix of characters on screen. About 2/3 of the way through the film there is a wonderful montage showing the characters as they complete their journey, again, really allowing the audience to immerse themselves in this world and feel like part of the gang. This film is a wonderful work of art that has sustained the years, and now resides in my personal top 20 favorite films!",10,0,1,11 December 2015
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove
","Stanley Kubrick is not one to stray from controversial subject matter. In 1964, Kubrick directed the scathing political satire Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Starring Peter Sellers, in three roles, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden, Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove tapped into the overwhelming fear of nuclear war that was immensely prevalent in the 1960's. Analyzing the threat of overreach of power and the ego problems that arise in international politics, Dr. Strangelove is as relevant today as it was in the heart of the cold war. Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has lost his mind. The poor General has gone completely mad, blaming fluoridated water for altering his body chemistry and contaminating his body fluids, Gen. Jack D. Ripper is sure that the U.S.S.R. is behind this conspiracy. Blaming the Russians for his 'ailment', Gen. Ripper sends his command to destroy Russia and attack with nuclear weapons. Once he sets the attack in motion, a 'Doomsday Machine', which nothing can stop is triggered. The 'Doomsday Machine' was created with the purpose of destroying all plant and animal life on earth. Panic sets in when the U.S. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky (Peter Bull) realize there is only one way to stop the worldwide destruction already set in motion and that solution lies in placating an inebriated Soviet Premier and former Nazi commander Dr. Strangelove. The world is involved in a race against time in which one side losing means everyone loses. I have such a strange relationship with the films of Stanley Kubrick. I more than recognize his supreme prowess as a film director. I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the first time this year and gave it a glowing 5- star rating, I find The Shining a shining 5-star film as well (see what I did there?). As much as I appreciate and respect his films, and see his superior directing in everything I've seen of his, I never reach for a Kubrick film to enjoy at random. There definitely 'mood' films for me that I may only watch a couple times a year, although never tire of. I read that this was the final Kubrick film to be shot in glorious black & white, which is fantastic, as such a political satire begs to be shot in black & white. The tone is much more heightened and shadows can be more manipulated in B&W than in movies shot in color, and Dr. Strangelove necessitated a look that takes itself maybe too seriously, as a B&W film can. Peter Sellers is well known for the difficult task of playing three roles in this film, which he did wonderfully, especially the scene in which he was on an extended phone call resulting in several laugh-out- loud moments. George C. Scott more than stole the show, for me, however. Every time he was on-screen, Scott stole the scene. He overplayed his part to perfection, creating one of the best characterizations I have seen on-screen in recent memory. Of course, several Kubrick staples made it into the film including his penchant for long takes. Kubrick's long takes are always a joy for cinema lovers and were an absolute necessity for the dialogue-driven Dr. Strangelove. With a beautifully brilliant script, Stanley Kubrick struck gold again, creating a perfect political satire as relevant today as it ever was.",10,1,2,28 November 2016
Alien," Alien
","I need to better familiarize myself with Ridley Scott. He's a director I have heard mixed reviews about, and one whom I have only seen a handful of his films. The first Ridley Scott film I watched was Legend, and I only saw that because Tim Curry was in it. Next, I watched The Martian, which is only memorable to me as being the first film I watched on my new blu-ray player, though it was a decent film. Alien fit my June theme of watching titles made up of one word or syllable. I guess what I'm getting at is that I've never been drawn to Ridley Scott's films for what they are, they've just always worked their way into my viewing schedules. After seeing Blade Runner last month, however, I began to become a bit more interested in Ridley Scott the director. His 1979 feature, Alien, starred Sigourney Weaver, and John Hurt as members of a team traveling through space to answer to an S.O.S. call from a distant moon. In what sounds like a paint-by-numbers who-dies-next film, Ridley Scott achieves an exceptionally atmospheric suspense film forcing itself to still be recognized today.In the near future, the year 2122, a commercial spaceship Nostromo intercepts a distress signal from a nearby moon. The seven-member crew, who had been in hypersleep are awoken as they begin their descent to the distressed moon. Kane (John Hurt) is the member lucky enough to be the one exploring the moon attempting to find the source of the stress. He gets too close to the discovery of eggs as one attaches to him putting him into a coma. Ash (Ian Holm) pushes for him to be allowed back on board the ship breaking protocol which puts all members of the team at risk. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) fights against breaking protocol the most making her an outcast on the team. The team watches Kane when suddenly the parasite dies and he awakens, seemingly largely unfazed by the incident. At dinner, however, it is revealed that much more danger is in store for the team than initially anticipated. I am such a sucker for sound design. I can become emotionally invested in a film for no other reason than its sound. I wrote down in three different ways in my notes how incredible the sound design was in Alien. I love John Hurt (R.I.P.) and Harry Dean Stanton so I was happy to see them in a film together. The vast incredible production design was an absolute treat to watch. The pacing and build-up of action were top- notch and demands the audience's attention all the way through. Typically, I don't pay too much attention to the actors in a film because I am so invested in the technical aspects, but Sigourney Weaver was incredible as the no-nonsense crew member who refused to be beaten. I enjoy the films in which the cast is picked off one-by-one, provided that it's done well and remains suspenseful, and Alien fits that bill. Despite the fact that at a certain point, you knew this was going to be a film where not many were left standing at the end, the tenseness and the deliberate pacing kept the film intriguing enough through the end. As a footnote, I have a huge cinematic black spot when it comes to sci- fi films so the only exposure I had to the famous scene in which an alien comes out of John Hurt's body was a Halloween costume worn by Darlene on Roseanne, so it was nice to finally know where that came from. A thrilling horror-sci-fi film that kept me interested in a genre I usually dismiss means I just may watch the rest of this series and end up seeing the new installment this year.",9,1,2,9 June 2017
Black Mass," Black Mass
","I had really been looking forward to Scott Cooper's 2015 feature Black Mass. I heard so much positive feedback about Johnny Depp's role, and never finding a reason to enjoy his work, I was hopeful to finally see what I had been missing with this actor. Also starring Joel Edgerton and Benedict Cumberbatch, Black Mass explores the life of infamous crime boss, Whitey Bulger. What was expected to be an interesting look at the life of one of the most elusive criminals in American history, turned into a movie trying too hard to be a Martin Scorsese picture.James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) Irish mob boss turned F.B.I. informant, was at the top of his game in 1970's Boston. When Bulger's interests began to be threatened in his native Boston by infiltrating Italian mobs, he stopped at nothing to keep his reign. Bulger had a career, if you could call it that, filled with soapbox discussions against those associates of his that expelled information. Yet, when Bulger was threatened, that is exactly what he did, shared information with the F.B.I., became an informant and only protected himself and his interests. Of course, being responsible for the death of dozens of people Bulger is no moral compass, but he quickly abandoned his vow of secrecy when it served him. Black Mass shows Bulger's rise to power, his time as a top crime boss and the many ways that title allowed him to control nearly every aspect of Boston, and his eventual arrest just 5 years ago. I found most things about this film a terrible miss. So much hype arose around Depp's portrayal of the infamous crime lord, I thought there was no way it could be wrong. Depp's acting was good, but nothing worth changing my opinion of him being a mediocre, yet overrated, actor. I have a notebook's worth of questions for the makeup department responsible for Depp's look in Black Mass. His makeup was atrocious and so overdone that it was distracting every time he was on screen. I would have appreciated more if Depp didn't look exactly like Bulger, and instead looked like he had an actual face. In addition to the horrible makeup, the blue contacts Depp wore looked like something out of a science fiction film. I get it, Bulger has blue eyes and Depp needed blue eyes for the film, but a couple shades lighter on the contacts would have still conveyed Bulger's blue eyes without the unrealistic glow-in-the-dark product we see on screen. I'm almost always a Benedict Cumberbatch fan, but the forced unnatural Boston accent he butchered throughout the film was another horrible distraction throughout. The whole film was off, and I suspect that largely has to do with Scott Cooper's attempts to create something Scorsese-esque. Everything about this film from the cinematography to the characterization of the actors felt like they were trying to imitate Goodfellas. There's only one Goodfellas, and there's only one Scorsese. Black Mass suffered from poor pacing, was lacking in even one character that the audience can attach themselves to, and was just plain boring. No mafia classic in the making here, Black Mass is sure to disappear without a trace.",2,0,1,7 September 2016
Shutter Island," Shutter Island
","Few current-day filmmakers have eclipsed the reputation of Martin Scorsese. Everything he touches seems to turn to gold. In 2010, Scorsese made his last production on film, to date attempting to strike gold yet again. With a master director at the helm paired with his frequent star collaborators, Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as a stellar cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams, Shutter Island, a 1950's noir thriller seemed nearly impossible to mess up. Visually breathtaking and a wonderfully told story make Shutter Island a resurgence of the great director's prowess. A promising young U.S. Marshall, Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital, a mental institution. He and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are ferried in to begin the investigation. Teddy has been trying for awhile to be assigned to the island for personal reasons, so when the opportunity arose, he leaped at the chance. Soon after arriving on the island, they learn that the missing patient has killed her children drowning them in a lake one by one. The troubling information about the missing patient rivals the troubling methods Teddy learns are employed by the hospital. Many of the methods are unethical, are even illegal. The more the duo finds out about the practices at the hospital and the cryptic messages left behind by the patient that disappeared, the more unsettling their surroundings become. As the vast island encloses around them, they are soon stranded due to a hurricane raging around them as it comes to light that Teddy might be part of a bigger plan the hospital is orchestrating which begins to bring his sanity to question.I can't talk about Shutter Island without first talking about the sound design. The sound soon acts as a character itself, bearing down on Teddy as he desperately struggles for truth and eventually creating the claustrophobic atmosphere that nearly kills him. The cinematography at the opening ensures that the audience will stay put until the film's conclusion and cement the belief I hold that nothing is better than actual film. There is a series near the opening of the film in which there are a series of jump cuts that are an incredible tool for establishing the rapid pace Teddy's mind is working attempting to understand the events unraveling around him. The world building in Shutter Island was incredible. No bit of detail was overlooked, from the paintings chosen to decorate the offices to the statues lining the hallway every single detail in the film is important and nothing is overlooked. The colors are amazingly vibrant, especially in the wonderfully executed flashback scenes, and seem to be influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. The low angle shots used throughout the film are positively captivating and engaging. I'm such a sucker for well-used low angle shots. Where the film really shines is in its brilliant reveals. When we learn the key elements of Teddy's life for the first time, the audience is gifted 30 of the very best moments in cinema. I was curious to see how well Shutter Island held up since the last time I saw it in the theatre shortly after its release, and I was thrilled to learn that it has only gotten better with age.",9,0,2,3 May 2017
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump
","I'm prepared to take some heat for this one. For my entire adult life, and most of my childhood and young adult life as well. I've been urged to see Forrest Gump. Never really being that into film until I started college, I had managed to consistently refrain from seeing the film. Then, of course, I begin a love affair with motion pictures that led my attempt to see every Best Picture Oscar ever crowned. I obviously could no longer avoid Forrest Gump, but now it was worse. I had never set out to purposely avoid Robert Zemeckis 1994 epic, I simply wasn't interested in it. After my evaluation of 1994 (once my affair with film started), I became upset that Forrest Gump could possibly win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction. As mentioned before, I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and I greatly appreciate what he does cinematically. Pulp Fiction is a classic with so many wonderful devices used; a true tour-de-force of Tarantino's incredible directing chops. I was then dumbfounded to learn that Quentin's masterpiece didn't lose to Robert Redford's Quiz Show, another movie I thought was in a class of its own. I might add that many people would insert Shawshank Redemption in this list of notable snubs I've provided, however, that film did for me all Forrest Gump did and left me unimpressed. Of course, I could only attest to whether or not the best film one if I see the winner, so it was time to see Forrest Gump.Forrest Gump is a mentally handicapped man living in Alabama, dependent on his mother (Sally Field) and growing up with his only friend Jenny (Robin Wright). Somehow, for various reasons, Forrest is present at every seminal moment of the second half of the 20th century. Forrest is present for so many historical moments, but unable to be present for the one thing he wants most; to share a life with Jenny. Through all the trials and tribulations that accompany Forrest's life, Jenny always manages back into the picture. Jenny is damaged herself, however, after enduring a broken home and molestation as a child, Jenny has a hard time coming into her own life. Forrest Gump tells proves even the most ordinary person can have an extraordinary life.The acting was fine, I'm by no means a fan of Tom Hanks, but I can recognize his commitment and success in this role. Robin Wright was more of a standout for me as the troubled loner, however. Sally Field played the role of a positivity laced protective mother, that would stop at nothing to provide for her son flawlessly. I also give credit to Zemeckis for shooting a great movie, as it was full of historical imagery and well-suited for the screen. What the film lacks, for me, far outweighs its strengths. I found the almost plot less adventures of one person quite boring, eventually becoming redundant. How many times can you be a part of something so historical by with hardly any resources and by complete happenstance? An audience certainly exists for Forrest Gump; Oscar crowned the feel-good story in 1994, over the best cinematic achievement which they are no strangers too. Needless to say, I'd take my non-linear favorite Pulp Fiction, or the gripping and socially important Quiz Show over another viewing of Forrest Gump any day.",5,0,4,7 March 2016
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 Things I Hate About You
","Gil Junger set the gold standard for modern-day adaptations of William Shakespeare works with 10 Things I Hate About You. Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out Junger's high school version of The Taming of the Shrew. When popular sought after Bianca Stratford is forbidden from dating until her feminist, tradition despising sister Kat decides to date, she feels as though her life is over. Bringing to life the Bard's work for a new audience, Gil Junger graced us with a modern-day classic.New student Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is instantly smitten by Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) His student tour guide, Michael (David Krumholtz) quickly informs him that Bianca is off limits to all, as her strict father has forbidden her from dating until her older sister starts dating. Cameron believes finding a date for Bianca's sister Kat (Julia Stiles) sounds like an easy enough task until he meets her. Kat is introduced to the audience tearing up a prom advertisement lecturing the student body on the patriarchal origins of the prom tradition. Realizing his feat to be almost insurmountable, Cameron enlists the help of Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) the school bad-boy with a mysterious reputation to hopefully lure Kat with his mystique. Cameron also cons the school model, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) into convincing him that he will be the one that gets to take Bianca on a date after Kat falls for Patrick. Believing he will get a date with Bianca, Joey provides the monetary bribe to Patrick promised to him if he can successfully manage Kat to agree to a date. When Patrick begins to fall in love with Kat, however, the whole strategy might fall apart. My favorite part of these Shakespeare adaptations are the allusion to the actual works of Shakespeare that are sprinkled into the adaptations. In 10 Things I Hate About You, some of these allusions include Kat actually being called a shrew by a classmate, Shakespeare being read in Kat's literature class, and their school being within a castle. These allusions act as great kisses to the original work, and provide a nice touch of enjoyment to members of the audience 'in the know'. 10 Things I Hate About You is made up of a predominately young cast that really bring their characters out of the Victorian Age and into the modern day quite nicely. The music in the film also goes a great length to making the story fun and relatable even to audiences who know little about the film's original inspiration. A well-done Shakespeare adaptation will be enjoyable for fans of the Bard's, as well as people who didn't even realize that the film was based on another; 10 Things I Hate About You accomplishes this feat, bringing Shakespeare to an audience who may otherwise have skipped him.",9,0,0,31 March 2016
Fargo," Fargo
","My brief encounter with the Coen brothers has been reminiscent of a roller coaster. I loathed The Big Lebowski but quite enjoyed Barton Fink. Fargo has given me the inspiration I've been lacking to deepen my relationship with their films. The 1996 crime drama was a fun descent into their take on a 'true crime' story. Weaving the tale of an inept crime organizer, trying to make his wife better by having his wife kidnapped for ransom money paid by his father-in-law, Fargo captures what it means to live in a town small enough to induce claustrophobia, and how suffocating an unfulfilled life truly is. Starring William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, and Frances McDormand, Fargo remains an audience favorite from the Coen brothers even 20 years after its release.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman, working at his father-in-law, Wade Gustafson's (Harve Presnell) dealership, unhappy with his current situation. He has an idea for an investment that he believes his wealthy father-in-law, who doesn't much care for him, will be willing to invest in. Jerry painstakingly goes over all the particulars of the deal with Wade only to be shut out when Wade decides to take the investment on with a partner, rather than give Jerry the initial capital to get it started himself. Devastated and humiliated, Jerry hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped. It will all work, Jerry believes, by requesting in ransom more than will be used to pay off the captors, leaving Jerry the remaining money to invest how he pleases. The operation should be easy enough and will avoid all the 'messy stuff' because Jerry is able to get the names of a couple people that will pull the kidnapping off from a man he works with at the dealership. Everything is going to plan until Wade refuses to let Jerry handle any of the particulars, vowing to take over the money exchange himself. Jerry's entire life begins to unwind with that decision as he finds himself in an even graver decision than he was before. On a personal note, it was fun to see William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi in a film together, as I spent a majority of my youth confusing the two actors with the other ( I don't know how, by the way). I spent most of the movie in complete awe of the way it was shot. Great emphasis is paid to mise-en-scene, throughout the film feeling quite claustrophobic when needed, and isolating when the script calls for it. As it turns out, despite the title card in the beginning of the film, not much in the Coen brother's Fargo is actually a true crime story, but as they noted, 'you don't need a true crime to have a true crime story.'",7,0,0,29 December 2016
The Thing," The Thing
","The Thing, the 1982 film by John Carpenter came highly recommended from several close film sources in which I trust. It is a horror movie, it's directed by a horror master, what's not to love for a fan of the genre. No one was more surprised than me that The Thing couldn't even hold my attention, necessitating 3 viewings before I could complete it. Mental note: if you fall asleep during a movie not once, but twice, it just may not be the film experience for you. I persevered, however, because I truly thought I would appreciate the film. The film stars Carpenter's most often collaborator, Kurt Russell as a researcher stationed in Antarctica that is suddenly impacted by an alien life form. A seemingly engaging premise left a lackadaisical impression and further left me with the idea that I may not like John Carpenter as much as I thought I did. During the first ****amn week of winter, a team of American explorers in Antarctica are shocked to find their base being swarmed by a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby base. When the helicopter crashes, the American team goes to investigate only to discover everyone at the base dead or missing. The team does find something of interest, however, when they happen upon the burned remains of an unidentified creature. The team gathers the charred remains, and take it to the base with them where they deduce that it is an alien life form. The most shocking aspect of the remains are that the creature can assimilate into any lifeform it inhabits, and it inhabits like a virus, easily spreading to person to person. The implications of this discovery mean that any member of the team may be inhabited by The Thing, creating tension between the group as they each struggle to distinguish between the unaffected members and the ones The Thing has taken over.I don't even know where to start here. I'm not typically a science fiction fan, and this film had a much more sci-fi than horror feel to it. As far as Carpenter's other work goes, I've only seen Halloween and Big Trouble in Little China, hardly enough examples to lay blame with the director. The narrative seemed to rely largely on an ominous feeling that was never properly established. Maybe my main qualm lies with the poor title. I do know that this film is a remake, I have never seen the 1951 original, but in Carpenter's film, I never knew what I was supposed to be scared of. A shapeshifting organelle that inhabits its host without them knowing is a good premise for a fearful mood, but it never materialized as such for me. There seemed to be several opportunities for more (or better) scares that were not seized upon. I'm so disheartened to learn that the directors I thought I enjoyed were really just responsible for one or two films that I enjoyed rather than the director himself. Wes Craven immediately comes to mind as I have now seen a few of his films, none of which replicating the magic of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, for me. Of course, I must see more of Carpenter's work before writing him off, but The Thing isn't the film to convince me to put any of his films at the top of my watchlist.",3,13,23,30 January 2017
The Revenant," The technical are the only aspects to take away from this one.
","Google defines revenant as: a person who has returned, especially supposedly from the dead. It is safe then to say that I was a Revenant after finishing Alejandro G. Iñárritu's big budget 2015 film. Strapping in for a 2.5+ hour film, that I was ensured would be pure cinema mastery, The Revenant proved to be a grave disappointment. All of the buzz from critics and fans only assure me that herd mentality is alive and well, and far more prevalent that even Friedrich Nietzsche could have envisioned.The audience is introduced to explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) early on in the film. A legend in his own right, Glass is charged with making sure his fellow fur trappers get home safely, as he is the one who knows the open country best. Joined by his son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) who is half Native American, Hugh is no stranger to tragedy. His Native American wife was killed by white soldiers, devastating Hugh and set him on a vagabond lifestyle afraid to call anywhere home too long. Along the journey, a long (seemingly endless) winter ensues and the group is forced to make difficult decisions to get home safely. Glass is seen as the most knowledgeable in regards to traveling which upsets another group member, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who almost always disagrees with Glass's assessment of whatever situation is at hand. After being viciously attacked by a bear, Glass is rendered incapacitated, unable to speak, and reliant on the group to return him to full health. The more brutal the winter becomes, the more Fitzgerald wants to leave Glass for dead and make headway along with the men, taking their firs to a big payday that awaits. Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), unable to pull the trigger and put Glass out of his misery, splits the group up, leaving Glass, Hawk, and the young Bridger (Will Poulter) to care for him and return home. Seeing an opportunity, Fitzgerald volunteers to join the boys and Glass along the way. After a scuffle with Hawk, then tricking Bridger, convincing him there are Native Americans on their trail ready to kill them, they leave Glass behind to fend for himself. In abandoning Glass, Fitzgerald goes against Captain Henry's orders that if Glass should take a turn for the worst, he is to have a proper burial. Believing he will die, Fitzgerald goes about traversing the wilderness with the unwilling Bridger (who sees what kind of man Fitzgerald really is). With nothing but anger and will power assisting him, Glass vows recovery with the notion that he will hunt Fitzgerald down over his betrayal. Forever dedicated to the memory of his family, Glass fervently searches revenge as vengeance overwhelms him.Sadly being overshadowed by DiCaprio, as the belief persists that he is overdue for an Oscar, Tom Hardy performs exceptionally well in this film. He plays a simple, yet greedy man capable of evil incredibly convincingly. It is not easy to pull off such opposite personalities, yet Hardy's brilliance as an actor makes it look easy. DiCaprio, on the other hand, plays his part in a perfectly mediocre way. There wasn't a lot to the part of Hugh Glass. Anyone can feign revenge and freezing. Why this part was seen as such a difficulty escapes me, but 'it's his year' they say. The cinematography was a thing of beauty, but how could it not be? When you have billions of billions of dollars and are using the great outdoors, you better turn out a fantastic product. The infamous bear scene was incredibly juvenile, as the CGI bear looked ridiculous against the real life wilderness. I understand Iñárritu's genius, as a I was a huge fan of Birdman, but he took everything that was good about Birdman and overdid it to the point of making it look ridiculous. What I do not understand is why Iñárritu chose to allow condensation and blood to splatter the camera. This was an odd decision as so much work was taken to establish realism; to then remind the audience that 'this is just a movie, see?' was a peculiar maneuver. This film was also over the top in its use of gore. What is interesting to me is that the same reviewers that criticized Quentin Tarantino's Hateful Eight for over the top violence, have no problem for that same imposing gore in The Revenant. Just goes to show, if you are viewed as an artist, like Iñárritu, instead of a director like Tarantino, you can get by with a lot more in Hollywood.What can be learned from The Revenant? Revenge should be left up to God, or the world, or Native Americans-whichever you prefer. If you are thinking, 'ok, lots of movies share that message' so was I, but for some reason, I thought this movie would tell it differently—it does not. I trusted that The Academy saw something in The Revenant that I needed to see too; I remain unsure of what that 'something' is. There are more problems than positives in The Revenant, and I am only left hoping for another Boyhood awards night; the movie everyone thought would win every award it was nominated for, yet only took home a single award. I am ever more convinced with each Best Picture nomination that I watch that The Academy really missed the boat on giving a nod to Carol.",6,2,3,25 January 2016
North by Northwest," North by Northwest
","File this one under a film that I am supposed to like a lot more than I do being a huge Hitchcock and movie fan. I am also not a Cary Grant fan, so maybe that's the problem. Anyway, in 1959, Hitchcock and Cary Grant teamed up again in North by Northwest, also starring Eva Marie Saint. North by Northwest involved the common Hitchcock theme of mistaken identity when a New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies. A thriller providing audiences with one of cinema's most well-known scenes, North by Northwest is a treat in Hitchcock's filmography.In the middle of a business meeting, Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) rises from the table to make a phone call when he is intercepted by a group of foreign spies believing him to be a government agent by the name of George Kaplan. No amount of urging will convince the spies that they have nabbed the wrong man, and Thornhill seems to be in inescapable trouble. After several murder attempts, Roger is able to escape, and while he is trying to make sense of the reason of his mistaken identity, Roger then becomes sought after by police as well. Seeking help and a place to hide, Roger comes across a beautiful woman called Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who helps him out of a jam and gives him an ally for his exploits. Soon after their chance meeting, however, Roger learns that Eve isn't the lily white innocent woman he thought she was, leaving Roger alone to evade capture along the crevices of Mt. Rushmore. Although, admittingly, no fan of Cary Grant's, I was more than overjoyed to see him play such a subtly funny character as he did in North by Northwest. It had been years since I had last seen North by Northwest, and I remembered not liking it much more than I did on this viewing. I quite enjoyed the first half of the film and the debonair yet comedic performance of Cary Grant's, I really don't remember him being as funny. It is interesting to note that the leading lady doesn't appear on screen until 45 minutes into the film. The pacing drops a little bit after that point, but the two principles interact well together on screen. Although I don't hold the prestige for this film as I should, being a student of Hitchcock's work, I enjoyed enough bits in the film to garner at least a viewing a year, as that's about all the Cary Grant that I can handle.",8,0,1,2 November 2016
Hugo," Hugo
","Hugo was one of those cinematic experiences I occasionally have in which I feel a need to pen a letter of apology once it was finished. As a young cinephile just getting my feet wet in film, I did what I thought we all were supposed to do; worship at the altar of Martin Scorsese. During my second Film Studies class, I struck a deal with my professor where he let me complete a career retrospective in place of making a short film for my final project. I was thrilled that my professor agreed to this deal, as writing a 60-page paper seemed like less of a daunting undertaking than operating a camera. I knew I was going to pick Martin Scorsese before I knew if my professor was going to let this happen or not. With his help, I watched every film Scorsese ever made from Who's That Knocking at My Door to Shutter Island. Not only did I see all of his full-length features but I also saw a great deal of his shorts and documentaries. It was supposed to be a cathartic experience of me getting as close as possible to the director I loved until it wasn't. That's not to say I didn't enjoy and appreciate many of Scorsese's films--I did, but I also learned that his enormous contribution to cinema didn't necessitate him being my favorite director. It's unfortunate that this project was one year too early to have Hugo included because once this project was complete, I tended to shy away from Scorsese films that came after, for a spell anyway. I missed seeing Hugo in the theatre, how could I have known I would have loved it so much and it would have been about one of my favorite cinematic subjects? Georges Méliès was one of my first cinematic idols, and he remains one today, as I am finally completely healed from my tattoo immortalizing his iconic image of the moon with a rocket that landed on its eye. I even attempted my own version of a shot-by-shot re-imagining of A Trip to the Moon, achieved by painting 146 individual canvas screens photographed to appear as though they move; an intensive labor of love that has never seen the light of day. Georges Méliès life being portrayed on screen would have been enough to get me to a theatre had I not been in such a Scorsese burn-out that I never even bothered to read what his 2011 film was about when Hugo hit theatres. Starring Ben Kingsley, Asa Butterfield, and Chloë Grace Moretz, Hugo is a brilliant spectacle that would make even the most devout skeptic believe in magic.Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Hugo follows an orphan boy who lives in the clock mechanism of the train station keeping the train clocks running so he can have a place to live undetected avoiding the orphanage. Still reeling from the death of his father, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) painstakingly works to repair an automaton (mechanical man) that his father instructed would only be complete with a unique key. Once Hugo finds the key, he will know what secret it contains and retrieves the last message his father sent him. While attempting to find the key, Hugo crosses paths with a shop owner Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who believes him to be a thief. When Hugo meets Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who is always looking for an adventure, Hugo learns that their paths were destined to cross in ways he could have never imagined.Hugo is one of the most beautiful films to look at that I have ever seen. Scorsese's outpouring of love to classic cinema and film preservation couldn't have tugged any harder on my heart strings if that had been the intention. Every single shot is gorgeous, capturing Scorsese's grand production design and exquisite colors. This is a film for us, for cinephiles, for the ones who don't feel the magic in any other setting than a dark theatre. Hugo is for the ones who dream in 16 millimeter and can't imagine a life without cinema. Hugo encompasses everything a cinephile feels in their heart when a film begins to roll, proving that 'the movies are our special place.'",10,1,3,19 June 2017
The Shining," The Shining
","I am not a person that gets concerned with book-to-screen adaptations. It's not that I am not a reader, I enjoy literature and read a great deal in my free time. I recognize, however, that books and films are two different mediums, therefore, have storytelling devices unique to the manner in which they work with a narrative. Stephen King's vocal and vehement opposition to the 1980 film by Stanley Kubrick means quite little to me. He may be right, the work originated with him, obviously, but films are different than books and should be appreciated as a separate entity rather than an extension of one another. I also wouldn't classify myself as a fan of Stanley Kubrick. That's not to say I don't think he's made some wonderful films---he has, I just don't list him among my favorites which make me an ideal candidate to speak evenly about his film and King's book. Kubrick's film starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall tell the tale of a writer and his family who become caretakers of a hotel with a dark history on a secluded mountain in Colorado. The Torrence family is in for a lot more than a quiet winter once they finally settle in. Kubrick really outdoes himself with his visually stunning version of The Shining. The staggering cinematography creates the immense isolation the leads succumb to, keeping audiences glued to the screen until the final minute.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) signs a contract to be the caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. Since the hotel will be empty while in Jack's care, he sees this as a perfect opportunity to work on his next novel. Just as he is signing the paperwork, he is warned that through the hotel's long history, there was a former caretaker that killed his family with an ax before shooting himself to death. Jack is unfazed by the news still focused on the opportunity to get a great deal of writing done during his time there. When he brings his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to settle in, things are alright for awhile, until Danny's gift of being able to see things from the past and the future, referred to as 'the shining' begins to warn him about the hotel, and hints at something sinister taking place in room 237. When Danny meets the head chef who also has 'the shining', who is preparing to leave the hotel for the winter, they speak about the sinister history surrounding the events that took place in room 237. The longer the Torrence family stays at the hotel, the more visions Danny has, and the deeper Jack surrenders to the insanity of such extreme isolation. When Jack starts becoming aggressive, Wendy and Danny begin to fear for their lives, thinking they may become the next victims of the Overlook Hotel.I'm a total cinephile, but I have few 'film traditions'. I enjoy seeing new-to-me films as often as possible, so I partake in very few re-watches. The Shining, however, is a film I watch every year on Halloween as a double bill with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. I've always been one of those people far more afraid of the darkest sides of human beings than an unhinged slasher. Despite watching The Shining every year, there hasn't been a viewing yet where I haven't sat in complete awe while watching it. I am completely immersed in the world Kubrick creates in The Shining, and that's solely due to his genius in portraying the subject matter. The sound design is extraordinary and creeps into the heads of those in the audience as subtly yet profoundly as Jack's isolation creeps into his head. I practically have to clean up the drool from the floor over the tracking shots Kubrick utilizes in the film. One of the best tracking shot in cinema history takes place in The Shining. Of course, I'm talking about the shot of Danny on his big wheel riding through the hallways of the hotel until being confronted by the horrors tucked away in the hotel's history. The brilliance and exquisite beauty of the tracking shots and long takes Kubrick uses to tell the story are fascinating, and never lose their luster no matter how many times you see The Shining. I've heard the criticisms of Nicholson, but I personally think that he was perfect for the role, and can't imagine anyone else playing the part of Jack Torrence. He was over the top at times, but the role calls for it the further he descends into madness. I also found Shelly Duvall's monotone agreeable attitude perfectly suited for her role of Wendy, as well. The camera work, direction, sound design, and performances come together in a magnificent sweeping package to create a piece of cinema that cements Kubrick's notion that film is an artwork, and should be repeatedly appreciated as such.",10,4,8,13 April 2017
American Beauty," American Beauty
","Being a big fan of David Lynch, I quite enjoy a movie that is a little 'off'. Having a political science degree, I definitely enjoy a movie that deals with deep issues like society and expectations. Sam Mendes' 1999 Best Picture winner embodies all of the above aspects that I like. About 20 minutes into this film, I was certain I was going to enjoy it. I wasn't wrong.American Beauty highlights one suburban family's struggle with cultivating the normality that is expected of theirs, and every other family in America. The perfect house and lawn, the successful parents with good jobs, the well-adjusted high school teenager. There is just one problem with this picture--it doesn't exist. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate agent vying for top spot in her market against a good looking competitor sweeping the field. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) makes a decent living in a job he hates increasingly more with each passing day. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the disillusioned youngest daughter in the house, struggling to fit in at school and eager to start her life. When a run-in with one of Jane's friends sets Lester headlong into a mid- life crisis, each weave of the Burnham family's seemingly perfect life comes unstitched.The overarching theme of this movie deals with the question, what is normal? The fact is, that answer is different for each individual. We see three different variations of normal just in the Burnham's neighborhood, let alone outside their block. Expecting life to come together into the cookie-cutter image you've expected since you were cognizant of your place in the world just isn't reality. Unfortunately, many people don't understand that false reality and attempt, for far too many years of their life, to create what they've always expected. True liberation comes with learning to be yourself. For that reason alone, you should make time for American Beauty. Oh yeah, and Kevin Spacey.",7,1,2,8 March 2016
Duck Soup," Duck Soup
","The method of each Marx Brothers film is the same, yet, each unique and essential to see on its own merit. Even though you know what to expect when you see the four brothers on screen, each film is a riot and a great time on its own. Duck Soup, the 1933 film featuring Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo was a hilarious satirical look at a president/dictator's reign over his nation. It had to be a treat for the great Leo McCarey to direct the brothers in such fantastic performances. No Marx Brothers film is a disappointment, but Duck Soup was a riotous heavy-hitting breakthrough, even for the usual fast- paced comedy I expect from the brothers.Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) new president/dictator of the land of Freedonia, a small country on the brink of economic collapse. Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), a wealthy widow, agrees to donate $20 million dollars to the country if Firefly was appointed dictator/president, a deal too sweet to pass up. Even though Firefly has no idea what he is doing in a leadership capacity, and refuses to do anything, even run meetings by the rules, the country may be in worse shape with him than without him. Whether for love, or money, Firefly becomes preoccupied with trying to win the heart of Mrs. Teasdale, but he is not alone. Also courting the widow is Ambassador Trentino, a wealthy, much more polished, nobleman. Trentino is also the leader of a neighboring country, Sylvania. The two leaders, fueled by their courtship of the same woman, begin to have several quarrels with each other using their country's interests as a guise. When armed conflict ensues, Mrs. Teasdale's house comes under attack, and whoever can save her skin, will be granted her heart. Rapid doesn't even begin to describe how quickly a Marx Brothers film is set up. Anyone with a short attention span would love Marx Brothers comedy, as they are not only quickly set up with jokes firing what seems like every second, but they are hilarious, even 80 years after they were delivered. And really, in cinema history, who is better at delivering such rapid quips than Groucho Marx? Often disregarded because of his signature slapstick style, Groucho is sensational in the quick-humored roles he always played. It is always fun to see him interact with Margaret Dumont as their on- screen chemistry was one of the earliest examples of perfection. The songs in Duck Soup were a wonderful reminder of how musically talented the Marx Brothers were; which is often forgotten because their comedic talents shine so brightly. The bits in Duck Soup were some of the best the foursome ever performed. I am a lover of Monkey Business and A Night at the Opera, but the mirror scene in Duck Soup, with Chico imitating a mirror image of Groucho is enough to secure a place at the top of any favorite Marx Brothers list for Duck Soup. Duck Soup reminds me how great the 'unfunny' Marx brother, Zeppo was, and how much I missed him in the later films. He was so much more than a straight man and was never fully utilized to his full potential. Maybe it was his choice to leave the group, or maybe it was mistaken narrow sight of his role in the group, but he remains my favorite Marx Brother for his versatility and musical skill. Delivering a social satire in the way only the Marx Brothers can, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator for what comic geniuses can get away with saying about society because they do it in a funny way, Duck Soup should be at the top of any list, not just Marx Brothers lists, but rather of standout films from the 1930's.",8,0,0,19 August 2016
Disturbia," Reality without the tv
","I first saw Disturbia during its initial theatrical release in 2007. I was 18 at the time Disturbia came out, so D.J. Caruso's thriller rife with subplots including the anguish of coming-of-age and teen romance meant that I was part of the target audience. I enjoyed Disturbia a great deal in the theatre and bought the DVD soon after as one of the last Hollywood Video rental stores closed in my area. After not seeing Disturbia for a few years, I was nervous to revisit it, for fear that it would be one of those films I enjoyed once because it fit a particular time in my life that I wouldn't get much out of after more maturation. I can pleasantly affirm my love for Disturbia is just as strong today as it was when I sat in the theatre the first time I saw it. I suppose it makes sense that I enjoyed it, I'm a massive fan of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. In 2010, the copyright holder of the Cornell Woolrich story that Rear Window was based off of, sued producer Steven Spielberg and his film studio DreamWorks for infringement. The lawsuit was dismissed, as the courts rightly recognized that there is much more to Disturbia than simply a Rear Window rip-off. Though the same voyeuristic protagonist and a mystery exist in both, the existence of one far from hampers the other.After a summer fishing trip ends with 17-year-old Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) behind the wheel of the vehicle transporting he and his father back home when it crashes killing his father, he feels responsible for his death. Kale's entire demeanor changes after his father's death, understandably so. His violent outbursts and increased aggression have led him to a few run-ins with the law. Just before school lets out for summer, Kale is sleeping through his final classes when he is called upon by his Spanish teacher to dictate his summer plans. Unable to do so, the Spanish teacher becomes upset and implores Kale to assess what his father would think of the situation. Triggered by the implied disappointment his father would feel towards him, Kale unleashes his anger and punches his teacher. Given a lenient sentence of 3-months house arrest, Kale is stuck with his internet and video game subscription canceled, left with nothing to do but gaze at his neighborhood through his window. 'Reality without the tv', as Kale calls it, is made all the more interesting when a beautiful young girl moves in next door. Determined to get to know her despite his spatial challenges, Kale charms the young girl enough that she begins to spend afternoons with him, giving him a welcome break from his only other visitor, his best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). Kale soon understands that his new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) has a depth and sense of mystery to her that he has not encountered with any of the girls at his school, making Ashley the perfect partner to investigate his standoffish and private neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse). Turner seems to fit the bill of a suspect police have been hunting believed to have killed multiple women. With little else to do but watch the comings and goings of his neighbors all day, Kale appoints himself as the prime investigator tasked to figure out if his neighbor is a cold-blooded killer.One thing I truly appreciate is when a director shows rather than tells his audience certain aspects of the plot. D.J. Caruso makes a brilliant directorial choice when he shows us the look on Kale's face as he makes his way to his father's side of the vehicle at the opening of the film. Seeing the shock and pain on Kale's face provides much more impact than the makeup and effects required to show a mangled body. The opening moments showing the fishing trip and its aftermath acted as a wonderful introduction to Kale and his personality before his loss and provided wonderful insight to Kale and his father's relationship. Each introduction to the nuances of the neighbors Kale sees from his room was exceptional, and just as uniquely descriptive as the ones in Rear WIndow which the scene brings to mind. The pacing and scares of the thriller side of the film were masterful adeptly creating the mood of intrigue. Shia LaBeouf has one of those yells that turns into a blood-curdling scream a bit too quickly for my liking, and his room was so large it was difficult to believe he couldn't find some new hobby to keep himself busy for the summer, but those complaints do little to detract from my enjoyment of the film. A tightly paced teen drama/mystery/thriller, Disturbia is compelling and a film that always provides a compelling ride with each revisit.",8,6,9,14 December 2017
Edward Scissorhands," Edward Scissorhands
","I hadn't purposely made the decision to neglect the works of Tim Burton, yet I found myself in 2017, despite being a huge cinema fan, without ever seeing a Tim Burton feature before in my life. It was time to rectify this oversight and settle in for Edward Scissorhands. The 1990 film starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder exploring the life of an abandoned invention turned man left alone when his inventor passes away before he is finished. Burton had a lot to say in Edward Scissorhands, very obviously, criticizing suburban culture and the social constructs of what constitutes as 'normal'. His message is clear and nearly overtakes the narrative coming off as an after-school special. Nevertheless, it was time to finally 'meet' Tim Burton.On the edge of the most picturesque suburban town, there is a castle that no one visits, and the neighbors know nothing about. Inside the castle, there lived an inventor (Vincent Price) responsible for elaborate designs taking over the entire castle. His most prized invention is that of Edward (Johnny Depp). He built a man, called Edward, a person made from parts, complete except for that of his hands. His hands were left as scissors before the inventor passed away. Since his inventor's passing, he lived alone in the castle secluded from the world and left to fend for himself. Trying to see Avon products, a kind neighbor named Peg (Dianne Wiest) happened upon the castle, finding Edward. At first, Peg is frightened by Edward and his scissor hands, but she eventually understands that he is a gentle soul yearning for some human interaction. Peg decides that she can't bear to leave Edward behind, so she invites him into her family's home. Initially, her family and neighbors are taken aback at the sight of the pale, scarred, man with scissors for hands. Eventually, though, Peg's friends and family come around, and once they get to know Edward, they realize he is sweet and unique and has talents appreciated by all. After such acceptance, however, things start to go wrong and the easiest person to blame is the different outsider.Tim Burton obviously hates suburbia, the entirety of Edward Scissorhands is his diatribe of all the problems of suburbia. He was so overt with his message that suburbia traps people, keeping them confined and limited. Burton also clearly illustrates how much being different is looked down upon, to an almost nauseating intensity. The camera angles Burton chose to use, while they were effective in creating the claustrophobic atmosphere he was going for, were uncomfortable to watch. The ratio created with the camera work he chose seemed too manipulative to appreciate. Johnny Depp was overkill with his expressions, taking one out of the film by being so distracting. The standout was the score/sound design, in an otherwise after-school special-like film far too overt with its message and seeming to make color/camera angle decisions for the director's own pleasure rather than for the audience.",2,0,3,14 February 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver Linings Playbook
","I've been struggling with writing this review's introduction for days, mainly because the film is awful. I've never been enamored with Bradley Cooper, and I really can't stand Jennifer Lawrence, but Silver Linings Playbook garnered a lot of critical acclaim at the time of its release and I was open-minded enough to treat the film as a blank slate and experience it. The 2012 film by David O. Russell was a bleak attempt at an artsy romance with a twist that actually came out to be as mainstream as any other romantic film released. The film follows a man after his release from a mental institution as he attempts to readjust into society post-diagnosis. A narrative with no one to root for or any personality to latch onto, Russell paints a disgustingly ignorant picture of mental illness that one should receive an award for completing.Despite medical orders and the advice of his doctors, Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is discharged from the mental institution from which he was court-ordered to stay to the care of his parents. Pat is only released under the agreement that he stays with his parents and abides by the restraining order established by his ex-wife. Pat doesn't want to take the medication he is prescribed and believes that he can 'become well' again largely by adhering to a physical regimen and strict reading schedule. His initial reaction is to re-establish a collection with his ex-wife, he's never taken his wedding ring off and believes that she will see her own flaws and eventually want to come back to Pat. As this possibility becomes more unlikely, Pat is set up with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of a friend of his. Although initially non-responsive to Tiffany's advancements, Pat eventually agrees to partner with her in a dance competition she has signed up for. Through the practicing, Pat becomes less obsessive over the thought of re-marrying his ex-wife and sees the possibility of starting a new life rather than simply resuming his former life, despite Tiffany's manipulation.Ugh. What a horribly lazy plot device--a dance competition that was so out of place in the film, a space landing would have fit better. Every character that we are supposed to care about is completely revolting, and I had no interest if any of their story arcs would work out for them or not. Did Hollister or American Eagle finance the film? It seemed like their glaring emblems were all I could see on-screen, especially during Robert De Niro's scenes. I don't know if the production team was too busy trying to create a fake-indie film that was actually incredibly mainstream to actually research mental illness but its portrayal was ignorant and offensive. The awful supposed twist ending was ridiculous. We were NEVER going to believe that his ex-wife had actually answered his letters. How do you root for a relationship based on mental abuse and lying to work out? I found nothing redeeming about this film and I hope to never even think of it again.",1,1,4,23 March 2017
Save the Last Dance," Save the Last Dance
","Save the Last Dance is a film I can put on anytime, regardless of my mood, and enjoy it. The Thomas Carter film from 2001, is not a light film by any means, dealing with race relations and the death of a young girl's mother and her drive to overcome the associated guilt she feels as responsible for her mother's death. Starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas, Save the Last Dance is one I enjoy because its subject matter never loses its relevance, and the human emotions are presented in a very real way affecting the audiences with every viewing. Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles), has always dreamed of being a ballerina, her mother has always been wholly supportive of her dreams, which is why it was so important to Sara that her mother was present at her audition for Julliard. Her mother, a florist with an incredibly busy schedule and informs Sara that she will be unable to attend her audition. Sara is devastated and begs her mother to adjust her schedule and be there for her big moment. Her mother is unable to turn her down and commits to being there. As Sara begins her audition, she is saddened to not see her mother in the audience and goes on unsuccessfully to complete her audition. A trooper informs Sara after her audition that her mother has been killed in an accident. Sara drops to the floor in despair, and her life is uprooted. Sara now has to move to be with a father she barely knows who has been absent most of her life and resume in a high school in an impoverished urban area of town. Sara has lived a homogeneous existence up to this point in her life and hasn't experienced much diversity so her new school and address are an incredible culture shock for her. After a tough adjustment, Sara is finally befriended by Chenille (Kerry Washington) who takes her under her wing, introducing her to friends at school and taking her to the hot dance club where a majority of students spend their free time. Sara also meets Chenille's brother Derek, a smart young man who must overcome the negative influences of the friends he surrounds himself with so he can better his life and attend Georgetown University. Derek decides to teach Sara the kind of dancing she will need to blend in at the dance club, and the two quickly fall in love. Throughout their union, Derek discovers the passion and talent Sara has for ballet and works with her to encourage her to resume her passion and audition for Julliard again. Sara is reluctant, as she feels she cannot make such a big step without her mother, but the confidence Derek bestows upon her may be the final push she needs to succeed. In a time and place in which interracial relationships are not looked upon highly, Derek and Sara must decide if their love for one another is worth overcoming the many stumbling blocks their relationship faces. Julia Stiles plays the complicated emotionally charged part of Sara quite well. Sean Patrick Thomas just exudes charisma each moment he is on-screen and shares an infectious chemistry with Stiles. Kerry Washington drives the story quite well, proving that she was just as brilliant of an actress we know her to be now 15 years ago. The score and choreography are spellbinding and takes up most of the film, while simultaneously driving a beautiful story. Oftentimes, in a teen dancing movie, the plot is neglected for the dancing, but that problem does not occur in Save the Last Dance, thankfully. While it does not enjoy much critical acclaim, I found the film an enjoyable narrative dealing with tough issues as suppressed guilt and interracial relationships in a meaningful and powerful way.",8,1,3,30 November 2016
Being John Malkovich," Being John Malkovich
","I wanted to be a philosophy major in college, but I also wanted to be gainfully employed so I abandoned that wish. Philosophy has remained a way of which I spend my time. A film, philosophical in its premise, will always be one that I gravitate towards. Being John Malkovich, the 1999 film by Spike Jonze is a film purely philosophical in its plot and approach. The film stars John Cusack as a man who makes a living as a puppeteer, desperate to control an aspect of his otherwise meaningless existence. When he finds a portal which allows people to enter into the head of actor John Malkovich, he attempts to make a profit with his business affiliate played by Catherine Keener. When both his business affiliate and wife played by Cameron Diaz fall in love with the actor, he has lost even more control of his life and may go to extreme measures to gain control.Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a struggling puppeteer who builds his own puppets and is desperate to make a living doing the work he is impassioned with, lives a life that is filled with mundane activities. When his wife and animal lover Lottie, who herself owns a pet store, encourages him to finally get a job, Craig finds himself at a company called LesterCorp, located on the seventh and a half floor with ceilings so low one can't fully extend their body to an upright position to work as a file clerk. Something seems off about this building and its personnel immediately, before Craig can even learn the half of it (I'm punny). While attempting to settle into his new work environment one day, Craig stumbles upon a small door in his office that leads him into the head of actor John Malkovich. Craig and his co-worker Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener) decide to sell 15-minute increments of time in John Malkovich's head as an experience to the public. At first, the revelation makes Craig feel as though he has some control and purpose over his life and the lives of others. Soon, however, his co-worker and crush Maxine begins to fall in love with the actor, then, Craig's wife falls in love with him as well after her 15-minute ride in the mind of John Malkovich. His newfound control and purpose begin to spiral out of control leaving Craig desperate to find a way to gain it back, despite what that means to anyone involved.The idea of self is heavily explored throughout Being John Malkovich. Malkovich's 'self' is intruded upon and under constant threat, which is a cardinal worry of many social philosophers. What does free will enter and how can one maintain their grasp on their free will when it is constantly under siege from so many intruders around us. Human isolation is also clearly illustrated throughout Being John Malkovich. Each of Craig's puppets is separated by a wall or some other object, and each of the people we meet in Craig's life doesn't spend too much time surrounded by others. Even the communal experience of gaining entry to John Malkovich's head further isolates people once their time as him ends. Each person that comes out of John Malkovich leaves appreciating his life more and their life less further calling to question issues of self. Perhaps the most overarching issue examined in Jonze's film is the question of the existence of a soul. What is beyond life and self and breaches the metaphysics, is anything. Each person seems more apt to explore the being of John Malkovich than actually explore their own identities. Perhaps there is nothing to the idea of soul to the filmmaker; either way, the existence of soul, the examination of self, and human isolation are extreme areas of interest to the plot and background of Being John Malkovich.",5,1,2,1 March 2017
She's the Man," She's the Man
","Bringing all of the gender confusion and love triangulating of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night to a high school setting was a wonderful way to bring the bard's work to a younger generation. Andy Fickman's 2006 film She's the Man starring Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum remained faithful to the 1601 work of Shakespeare with perfectly modern twists to engage a brand new audience. Much like Twelfth Night (1996), She;s the Man stayed true to Shakespeare's theme of gender confusion, She's the Man also brings secrecy and betrayal to the forefront more so than the bard himself. Even with gender roles reversed and interchangeable, the overarching message in She's the Man is what it means to confide in someone and how damaging it can be when trust is broken.High school student Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) is a star soccer player on her girl's soccer team. For Viola, soccer is life, which is why she feels as though her life is over when her school's girl's soccer team is cut. Viola and some of the girls go to the boy's soccer team and ask if they can join. Viola is sure that they will comply as her boyfriend is the goalie of the boy's team and has expressed to Viola that her talent exceeds half of the members of his team. When the boys scoff at the idea of having girls on their team and refuse the girls, Viola seeks revenge. Viola then learns that her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk), newly enrolled at a new high school, is fleeing with his band for London and will miss his first two weeks of school. Viola decides to go to the new high school in her brother's place, make the soccer team, and beat her own high school's boys soccer team exacting revenge on her school and ex-boyfriend. Viola didn't expect to fall in love with her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) who is trying to seduce the popular Olivia (Laura Ramsey). Olivia connects with Sebastian/Viola and eventually falls in love with her, not knowing, of course, that Sebastian is Viola in disguise. Calamity ensues when the real Sebastian returns from London early, unaware that he has been replaced at his school by his sister. The connections all throughout She's the Man to Twelfth Night were a pure joy for this literature buff. The artful ways in which they brought pieces of Shakespeare's tale of the modern day were wonderful. I especially appreciated naming the rival school that Viola attends in Sebastian's place that of the town Viola washed upon after the shipwreck in Twelfth Night. I also enjoyed the naming of the spider in She's the Man to bring about the source inspiration, as well. I especially enjoy a reimagined film that pays proper tribute to the version it is reimagining. The acting is nothing to write home about. It is a teen comedy with younger actors playing teenagers, nothing extraordinary, but all parts were played adequately. The music was the real clincher for She's the Man. The upbeat fun music really made the transformation for the bard's work of aristocracy to the high school halls in a great way.As mentioned before, and fleshed out in another review, Twelfth Night deals heavily with the theme of gender confusion, likewise, She's the Man does the same with the main character Viola dressing as her brother. What She's the Man does that Twelfth Night didn't do is focus primarily on secrets and betrayal. Much more emphasis was placed upon the secret Viola was keeping from her roommate in She's the Man than Viola's secret she was keeping from the Count in Twelfth Night. It was interesting to see that turn and the prominence placed on secret keeping in the reimagined work. Even the film's tagline begins with 'Everybody has a secret...'. The emphasis on this film certainly lies within all of the mini betrayals between the gender confusion, and all others involved with it. The shift from the curse of love to trust and secrets was an interesting choice and made for a slightly more engaging film. There's something in this film for everyone, and even if you ignore the bard's inspiration in the film, you will still come away enjoying it.",7,1,1,21 March 2016
Gandhi," Gandhi, part of the story
","It appears as though I am in the minority of many reviewers of this film, in that I didn't care much for it. Perhaps, after a second viewing, I would find more to appreciate about this film. Although I can recognize the exceptional acting of Ben Kingsley, it is not enough to warrant a second viewing from me. I found the pacing incredibly slow, and I am not one that immediately holds distaste of a long movie. On the contrary, I rather enjoy long movies, as I feel that is the best movie to see the most writing. This movie, however, went into far too much minute detail of the titular character's life, for me. Gandhi tells the story, well, of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian lawyer turned liberator and world leader promoting peace and love towards fellow human beings. A simple ideology, much like Jesus taught, which is certainly deserving of a long movie evaluating the man behind the message and seeing from what beginnings he came. The way this movie was done simply didn't do that for me. A tour-de-force performance from Ben Kingsly wasn't enough from keeping the rest of the movie from falling flat. Elevated to mythic proportions, I wonder how much of the Gandhi on-screen from the 1982 Best Picture winner mirrors that of the Gandhi that walked the earth. A feel-good film that avoided much of the titular figure's controversies left me incredibly disappointed. there was more to Gandhi that met the eye, certainly; but there was even more to Gandhi than met the eye, even upon the conclusion of Richard Attenborough's epic.",6,0,0,4 March 2016
American History X," American History X
","American History X acted as my introduction to Tony Kaye and didn't leave me thirsting for any more of his work. The 1998 film, was his directorial debut, and that fact showed. The film stars Edward Norton as a former white supremacist reformed after a jail sentence who now wants to help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, avoid traveling the same path. What the film lacks in character depth it makes up for in its overarching moral message. American History X is devoid of all real human complexity in favor of the easy and overly simple message against racism without ever actually showing much in the way of race relations. Everything about American History X is safe, and safe films are rarely remembered years after their release.Edward Norton's Derek Vinyard, an easily mentally manipulated young man living in the increasingly diverse Venice Beach area of Los Angelis, California. Early one morning, Derek's brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) alerts his brother that his car is being broken into by 'some black guy'. Derek answers by loading a gun then heading outside in his underwear firing as soon as the door is open. Derek is arrested and sentenced to serve three years in prison. He bars his family and friends from visiting him while he is in prison, leaving everyone shocked when a completely transformed Derek emerges. When the white supremacist group that he used to head throws a party for his release, Derek wants no part of it and only attends the party to warn his former mentor to stay away from his brother and sever ties with everyone there. Derek's time is now spent trying to get his life back on track, find a job, and keep himself out of jail. His purpose, however, is to keep his brother, who idolizes Derek and watched his every move for years, out of the racism-fueled group that he fostered. He must impart his new-found enlightenment on his brother before it is too late. Aside from the glaring plot deficiencies, American History X is shot in a painful way. The heavy reliance on extreme close-up and often off-centered shots miss the grittiness the director may have been going for and is instead nauseating. The memories shot in black & white came off incredibly gimmicky and really didn't serve the advancement of the narrative in any way. The transition from black & white memories to present-day color shots was far from smooth and was rather distracting. American History X is not the type of film that requires a voice- over, yet, it was voiced-over throughout the entire film. Even if a film doesn't need a voice-over, it's easier to forgive if there is a succulent voice providing the narration; American History X does not have this either. There is a heavy reliance on the shots of this film to provide a shock factor, rather than the narrative itself which is indicative of poor directing when you're working with a plot as explosive as race relations. Back to the plot, the audience is told all throughout the film that Derek is smart, but we are never shown that. Twice through the movie, the audience is shown just how little it takes to emotionally and mentally manipulate Derek, leaving one to wonder if his 'transformation' will even be permanent. The betrayal in the final scene may be just another manipulation to push Derek back to his old ways of vitriol hate. There's just not much to take away from Tony Kaye's feature film debut, which is disappointing considering that it could have been a masterclass in cinema, given its premise.",2,3,9,29 December 2016
Dirty Dancing," Dirty Dancing
","Add this to the file of films I didn't think I would like nearly as much as I did. Wow, I couldn't have been more wrong Dirty Dancing. Emile Ardolino directed the 1987 classic starring Jennifer Grey and the late Patrick Swayze. The film centered around a sheltered daughter and the life-changing summer her family spends at the Catskills resort in 1963. What I had written off as 'just another '80's romance' was actually a wonderful coming-of-age story of a girl discovering how the world exists outside of her privileged upbringing.Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey) a daddy's girl from a privileged family has already surprised her family by announcing that she is to join the Peace Corps at the end of the summer. She had been expected to go college and marry a doctor, the same profession as her father and establish a financially secure life for herself. One night, however, a chance meeting changes her destiny. All baby thought she was doing was carrying a watermelon to a staff dance party when she first lays eyes on Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) the chiseled dance instructor of the resort. Johny knows no privilege, and unlike Baby, has had to struggle his whole life. His life is nearing a downward spiral since his dance partner has become pregnant and unable to get the money or the healthcare access to an abortion. Wanting to help a distressed woman and find a way into Johnny's heart, Baby lies to her father about the purpose and is given the money Johnny's dance partner uses to obtain her abortion. She then fills in as Johnny's dance partner in order to save his spot on the roster. As the two spend more and more hours together they fall in love and Baby is stuck between her family's expectations and her own romantic interests. As her father begins to find out what Baby has been up to and how he has been used in the scheme, her relationships with everyone are tested and she must decide how to mend them, and which to attempt to save first.Dirty Dancing begins with an opening narration, and I am an absolute sucker for a well-executed narration. The narration was used well and effective in providing a bit of background info into the background Baby had enjoyed all of her life. Throughout the film, it felt a bit like I was watching Double Indemnity with all the Baby's, so I only wish Baby had earned a different nickname; although, I suppose the iconic line 'Nobody puts sweetie in a corner' would have had the same effect. The dancing was engaging, and not as annoying of a storyline as I presumed it would be. I thought it was going to be a tired 'spends a lot of time together so they fall in love' kind of romances, but the added layers of the upbringing struggles was an engaging aspect. Patrick Swayze's performance was riveting, I haven't seen much, if any, of his acting roles so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with both his acting and dancing skills. Jennifer Grey nailed the dancing angle but came off a bit wooden throughout her non-dancing scenes. The supporting cast was wonderful, as well; I mean, has Jerry Orbach ever been less than stellar in a role he has taken on? Dirty Dancing proved my expectation of 'just another 80's romance' wrong, I can assure you of that as I stand in line at Target waiting to buy a copy of the film.",8,2,3,5 April 2017
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," This picture looks dusty
","There are a few good things I can write about this film. For instance, the cinematography was outstanding! The camera work, especially in regards to the face shots were truly works of art. Another positive part of the film was the narration. Obviously, from the title of the film, it was not a surprise that Robert Ford, who we meet early in the film, would bring about the downfall of Jesse James. What I appreciated about this film is that the Director (Andrew Dominik) didn't attempt to surprise us with the ending either. The narrative style proved a great vehicle for the film as it was told as a story recollecting the fall of a historic figure. One other thing that can be positively stated about the film was its score. Warren Ellis and Nick Cave crafted a beautiful score that highlighted the downfall of the once great power, Jesse James. The needlessly long story chronicles the final months of Jesse James life, and the boy who idolized him. I call Robert Ford, played by Casey Affleck a boy at 19 years old because his hero worship of Jesse James rendered him almost infantile. We meet Jesse James after his heists and notoriety had already consecrated him to the status of legend. Robert Ford, who has followed Jesse's 'career' since he was a young boy arranges it for himself to meet Jesse's gang. After some finagling, and hard feelings from the other members of his gang, Jesse James let Robert Ford tag along with them. Each shift closer between the two brings about an increasingly uneasy feeling for the audience. This feeling could be attributed to the title and the well-executed score. We know what will end up of James and Ford, so each awkward interaction between them is even more heightened. Nevertheless, the film feels like an invitation to a star struck stalkers fantasy than a real friendship of any kind. As we watch Jesse's days come to a close, and see Robert's hero worship take over his mind we truly see the downfall of one giant, and one little boy. Even though the film had some great technical work, other aspects of the film overshadowed the technical beauties. For instance, Pitt's performance came off cardboard. I didn't believe him for the legend he was supposed to be, even if it was set in James declining days. Casey Affleck's performance also wasn't right. He mastered the portion of his character that was to be feared and retracted, but the times that he was supposed to have acted with leadership didn't fit at all. Every gunshot scene in this film was tragically overdone. I subscribe to the notion that a good film tells more of a story with what is understood than with what is seen. I am sure that a gunshot wound to the head would lead to a great deal of bloodshed; I don't need to see it, once or 8 times. There are many great westerns, even modern day filmed westerns, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, isn't one of them.",4,0,3,11 December 2015
To Rome With Love," To Rome with Love
","I was too quick to judge Woody Allen's films that take place outside of New York. I still much prefer the more familiar setting of New York in Woody Allen films, but MIdnight in Paris and To Rome with Love prove that Woody knows exactly what he was doing whether he was in the U.S. or not. His 2011 film, MIdnight in Paris won Woody an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Allen's 2012 film To Rome with Love may not have won him any statuettes, or much critical acclaim, for that matter, but it did prove Allen's prowess outside of New York that film audiences have associated him with through most of his career. Starring Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, and the return of Woody Allen, To Rome with Love, is an entry late, but a worthwhile entry in the career of Woody Allen.In a familiar structure for Woody Allen, To Rome with Love follows four unrelated stories which take place in The Eternal City. In one story we follow a native New Yorker, Haley (Alison Pill) who meets Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) a lawyer and political leftist. After spending some time together, the two fall in love and plan to marry at the end of the summer. Her parents, Jerry (Woody Allen) and Phyllis (Judy Davis) fly to Rome to meet Michelangelo and his family. Jerry, a retired opera director hears Michelangelo singing and becomes convinced he is a star in the making and sets his sights on turning the shower singer into an opera hit. The audience also gets to know Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Millie (Alessandra Mastronardi) newlyweds who have just moved to Rome so Antonio can take a job with his relatives. Millie gets lost in the city and Antonio, refusing to go to a lunch meeting/introduction of his new wife alone enlists the help of Anna (Penélope Cruz) to pose as his wife. In yet another unrelated story, John Foy (Alec Baldwin), an architect from America who now designs shopping centers stumbles upon Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) an architect student who reminds John of himself 30 years younger. Jack and his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig), a fellow student, are enjoying a vacation when they get a call from Sally's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) who is unexpectedly going to meet the couple in Rome to help herself get over a breakup. Jack and Monica share an instant attraction which builds in intensity the more time they spend together. Luckily for Jack, John is in tow to act as a life guide for Jack in hopes of helping him prevent making a big mistake. The final story finds Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) a loyal husband and a hard-worker who doesn't have much excitement to look forward in his life suddenly thrust into fame without explanation. All of a sudden, Leopoldo's life is documented by reporters as he is constantly followed by the paparazzo. Stuck between being happy that he is now being noticed and wanting his quiet life back, Leopoldo is left with only being able to ride the wave until he is returned to his former life if he ever is.I will never cease to be amazed at the incredible depth Woody Allen can give to so many stories simultaneously. Often times, throughout my viewing of To Rome with Love, I felt like I was watching a mini-series there was so much independent detail to each storyline. The quality writing of Woody Allen is a facet of his I will never tire of. My favorite part of To Rome with Love, despite Woody Allen's portion of the young love segment, was the time spent with Leopoldo. Just as Woody did in his 1998 film, Celebrity, he takes a scathing look at the celebrity culture, even providing commentary on the differences in treatment male and female celebrities must deal with. Hearing reporters yell out inquiring why Leopoldo's coffee spilled and whether he wears boxers or briefs resonates with anyone who has flipped through a magazine while in line at the grocery store. The way Leopoldo is abandoned when a new 'celebrity' emerges and resists the quiet life he thought he wanted back, clearly illustrates the fears of those in the public eye rarely explored. Roberto Benigni was a brilliant bit of casting to tell Leopoldo's story. Benigni came to the attention of many American film fans only in 1997 after years in the entertainment industry when he enthusiastically walked on top of the seats at that year's Oscars ceremony to pick up his statuette for Best Actor in the Best Foreign Language winning film, Life is Beautiful. The parallels to Benigni's own life and Woody Allen's focus on the seedy aspects that are lumped in with the glamour of being a celebrity. Each story had its high point, and each added to the overall narrative, but Benigni's was my personal favorite and perhaps had the most to say in regards to society.",8,1,2,31 July 2017
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan
","Steven Spielberg's gripping epic, Saving Private Ryan was a film that went to great lengths to accurately depict the events of WWII. The 1998 Best Picture winner starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and a great ensemble cast tells the story of the sacrifice of many for the one. Conveying the message of brotherhood and sacrifice, Spielberg drove the message home through his grand WWII epic. Saving Private Ryan opens with the allied invasion of Normandy with an intensely elaborate 12-minute scene in which Spielberg captures the essence of war with incredible accuracy. During the invasion, two brothers are killed, along with many others. Previously, a third brother was killed as well and thankfully, a sharp-eyed stenographer noticed that the mother, Mrs. Ryan (Amanda Boxer) would be receiving all three telegraphs informing her of her 3 son's deaths on the same day. When the Army General, George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell) learns of a fourth enlisted brother, he takes the opportunity to alleviate the mother's stress and find the fourth brother and return him home safely to his family. Marshall assembles a group of 8 men on a death- defying mission to find Private Ryan and get him to safety. I will doubtfully never tire of a film told backward, as Saving Private Ryan was. We first meet an elderly gentleman that we later find out is present-day Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery with his family. Spielberg especially uses this technique to its full capacity in this film, allowing the audience to see how much sacrifice is worth when we see a trove of people that wouldn't have been possible without the mission to save Private Ryan. The opening battle scene with the invasion of Normandy was obviously intense and gripping. Spielberg went to great lengths to ensure the film's realism, even down to the positioning of body's on the beach. On a much lighter note, it was fun to see the cameos that were frequent and unexpected throughout the movie. We see Ted Danson and Bryan Cranston with bit parts in the film and unexpected big name cameos that don't distract from the story are always fun. There were several scenes with great use of characters storytelling throughout the film. This device was well utilized and helped distract from how much the film slowed down in the middle, or how needlessly long some of the battle scenes were. I typically find Spielberg films over the top and just aiming too hard for the jugular of the audience; Saving Private Ryan was probably doing those things too, but it was a better film in spite of it than some other Spielberg productions.",7,1,2,9 May 2016
Lawrence of Arabia," Lawrence of Arabia
","David Lean's 1962 Best Picture Academy Award winning film, Lawrence of Arabia leans on Lean's inventiveness as a filmmaker. The film clocks in at just under 4-hours and relies wholly on the concept of developing Peter O'Toole's titular character. Joining O'Toole are notable actors Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif to tell the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who sought to go into the desert to unify the divided Arab tribes to fight the Turks in WWI. Lawrence took the burden of unification onto his shoulders voluntarily, believing he could be a great force for unity; Lean's portrayal of Lawrence's story is nothing short of an artful masterpiece.This film captured my heart from the opening scene. A backward narrative always pulls me in, and can almost guarantee that I'll be engaged through the entire film. We learn of Lawrence's fate with the opening scene, then, we are shown his life and his various unexpected accomplishments. a multi-faceted, somewhat difficult English officer T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who seeks to go into the desert and further the English ambition against the Turks. The only problem was, as much as Lawrence was revered for his mind, he was chastised for his tongue. Lawrence was no rank and file soldier; he often mouthed off to high command and never abandoned his own principles. Lawrence just might be crazy enough to make this work, was the consensus of the high command as they sent him to deserts of the Middle East. After overcoming a rocky start, Lawrence made friends along his travels, eventually earning the respect of Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) who holds great power in the Middle Eastern deserts. After much intricate maneuvering, Lawrence eventually brings together the divided Arab tribes against the common enemy, the Turks; all the while furthering the English position against the Turks. Lawrence is the most unlikely hero, yet his idiosyncrasies suited him perfectly for the task at hand.The absolute highlight of this magnificent film is the incredible acting prowess of Peter O'Toole. O'Toole completely mastered the piercing stare, the jaunty walk, and the effeminate mannerisms consistently noted characteristics of T.E. Lawrence. O'Toole was a master as the awkward, undaunted British officer; well worth the top spot on Premiere Magazine's list of 100 Greatest Movie Performances of All Time. This was the first role of O'Toole's I have ever seen and I can't wait to take in more of this great actor's work. This film also has some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. Shot in real life deserts, Lean spared no expense bringing the toils of Lawrence to life. The stark realism brought about by the rigorous shooting schedule and intense commitment from David Lean have entrenched Lawrence of Arabia as a classic for audiences of all ages. Another standout from this film is the incredible soundtrack. The music transforms the audience from their couch to atop a camel bringing the travels of Lawrence to a relatable level. The magic of the music and the acting and the beautiful shots come together to gift the audience with a glamorous spectacle to enjoy again and again. Do yourself a favor, and watch Lawrence of Arabia, at least once.",10,4,7,25 April 2016
Room," Make Space for Room!
","A fantastic feat in directorial achievement from Lenny Abrahamson, Room gives the audience a front row seat to the power of love and unrelenting devotion. Revealing the commanding force of love between a mother and her son when they are the only two people in their world, Room is an incredible tribute to the essence of human existence. The first half of the movie is filmed in the garden shed prison shared by the captives, proving Lenny Abrahamson to be a phenomenal director more than capable of creating a powerful film with little space. If you see no other Best Picture Nominee from this year's Academy Awards, please see Room; for it is truly the most captivating piece of art up for this year's top prize.The audience is immediately thrust into the gripping story of Ma, who used to be known as Joy (Brie Larson), and her son Jack (Jacob Trembley) prisoners in a reinforced garden shed attempting to 'celebrate' Jack's fifth Birthday. We soon learn that Joy was kidnapped 7 years before by a man, only known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) who is holding them hostage. Repeatedly raped, Joy gave birth to a son since her kidnapping. Jack and Ma, as he calls Joy, are never allowed to leave the shed, called Room, and Jack has not seen the outside world in his entire life. With as active an imagination as any 5 year old boy, Ma tells Jack stories to keep him entertained and distracted from the grim reality in which they live; a reality where pants are treats only delivered one day a week. Reaching the end of her psychological rope, Ma devises a plan to save herself and Jack, allow her to return to life in the outside world, and give Jack a proper childhood among family and friends, trees, wind, and even bugs. Escaping Room proves to be more daunting than happy, as Joy has lived in constructed isolation for so long that her adjustment to the outside is difficult. Jack, having almost no immune system, must make an extremely careful entry into the world; a world that he has only been introduced to in his 5 years of life to an old television with a blurry picture. Seeing everything the world has to offer proves overwhelming for Jack and he seeks out Ma more than ever. Rediscovering and creating human identity, rejoining family and friends and a normal life, and creating a life for Jack illustrate the journey that one woman will traverse to give everything possible to her little boy.Brie Larson is one of the year's standouts this year in the role of the embattled, psychologically exhausted Ma. She eloquently displays the desperate yearning for life outside the garden shed, yet shows her complacency of not seeing a way out in extraordinary fashion. The child actor, Jacob Tremblay was also a force as the boy whose entire life has been lived in four walls. He excels when he shows the wonder of a 5 year old out in the world that he has never had the opportunity to experience. The two work together so well, and develop a compassionate chemistry on screen, creating a truly powerful experience for the audience. Watching the two only have each other, desperate for things among everyday life that seem so inconsequential was an incredible experience.Identity and love are the cornerstones explored in Room. Joy lost her identity once she was kidnapped; she is then tasked with creating a new one for herself and her son in order to simply be able to live through their shared experience as captives. Jack, on the other hand, is robbed of developing his own identity apart from his mother. Once out of room, he is exposed to parts of the world he thought didn't truly exist, and being in contact with all of life's wonders in such a short amount of time was magical, yet overwhelming for the young boy. The depths of love explored in this movie are unparalleled by any other film in 2015. Constantly having her body violated, Joy became pregnant by her captor, eventually delivering the baby inside the garden shed. This all happens off-screen, but is a difficult concept for the viewer. Able to look past the harrowing truth behind Jack's conception, Joy loves him and would stop at nothing to protect him. Likewise, Ma is the only person Jack has ever known, his autonomy is solely based within her, and he is so devoted to his mother that he keeps a tooth of hers that fell out in his mouth so he always has a piece of her. Compelling is the story of how deep love lives within human beings, despite the circumstances we encounter.Without question, Room is the standout as far as art pieces recognized by the Academy for their top prize this year. (I am still upset that they missed out on recognizing Carol) I sincerely hope that Room pulls out a dark horse victory for the highest honor this year. If nothing else, I hope that Todd Haynes wins a statuette for Best Director, as the range he gained from the two actors inside four walls is unmatched in skill and product. A gripping tale of love and identity among on-going psychological hell, Room is uncontested in delivering its message. One can only cross their fingers that The Academy gets this one right.",9,1,6,26 January 2016
Schindler's List," Schindler's List
","Oskar Schindler was a German member of the Nazi party who saved the lives of over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. In 1993, Steven Spielberg believed Oskar Schindler's was a story that needed to be told, directing that year's Best Picture Academy Award winning film. Casting Liam Neeson in the titular role with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes in strong supporting roles, Oskar Schindler's courageous story was brought to life. The story of an unlikely hero proves the point that even the most individual of lives can be turned to a life lived for the masses. Oskar Schindler was not who you would typically think of as a hero. He was a drinker, a womanizer, and a frequent gambler who had one goal in mind of becoming a millionaire. Liam Neeson illustrates the many flaws of Oskar wonderfully through his many scenes drinking, gambling, and philandering against his wife in the first half of the film. The Holocaust gives Schindler a golden opportunity to realize his dreams of riches. Schindler begins to employ vulnerable Jews as laborers in his factories, saving them from certain exile and saving him immense amounts in labor costs. Gradually over time, he becomes deeply affected by the treatment of the Jews, especially that of his accountant and partner of sorts, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Schindler then starts going to great lengths to protect as many Jews as he can, even convincing the German high command to allow him to build another factory and employ more Jews. Schindler even puts himself at risk by going head to head with Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) S.S. Officer in command of Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp. Even when one camp is closed, Schindler arranges for 'his' Jews to be transplanted in another factory. When the train carrying truckloads of Jewish women is deferred to Auschwitz, Schindler races the train down to have them freed using funds from the massive riches he has amassed. By the war's, and the film's conclusion, we see that Schindler has lost all of his wealth in the attempt to save as many Jews as he could from persecution; being responsible for saving the lives of 1,200 people. Many film devices were used exceptionally well throughout this film which is no doubt due to Steven Spielberg's skill as a director. The film starts out in color, then fades to black and white only to be illuminated in color at its conclusion (and who could forget that red coat scene). This was a marvelous way to illustrate the lives of the millions of Jews affected by the Holocaust to the grim reality they faced once it started (black and white) to the realities they could experience after the persecution ended (return to color). The film could not have told the grim tale it told in color and the fade to black and white was one of the brilliant decisions Spielberg made in this film. The title cards used throughout the first quarter of the movie was a wonderful use to keep the audience engaged and learn further details about the characters involved. The most powerful aspect of this movie has to be its use of sound. I have never watched a movie that used sound so well in a film, especially diegetic sound. The sound is the easiest way to pull an audience into a film and to set the mood of the story, Spielberg, however, uses sound in inventive ways to produce realism by really immersing the film into the 1940's. The film closes with a powerful scene in which we see, in present-day the many descendants of the people saved by Schindler's list, reiterating the powerful reminder of the origins of dangerous political power, especially needed in today's election cycle.",5,1,5,9 May 2016
The Elephant Man," Humanizing the Elephant Man
","David Lynch and Mel Brooks sound like a cinematic partnership that teeters on the edge between the surrealism of a Lynch film and a gag from a Brooks film. Nevertheless, these two would work together in 1980 on Lynch's second feature, The Elephant Man. Simultaneously, yet separately, both Brooks and Lynch had interest in seeing The Elephant Man, a script written by Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore based on the novel by Sir Frederick Treves. Treves book highlights the heartbreaking existence of John Merrick, whose severe disfigurement relegated him to a near imprisonment as a circus freak show exhibit. After making a film as polarizing as Eraserhead, Lynch wasn't exactly having to sift through many offers for work. Thanks to Stuart Cornfeld, a film producer who enjoyed Eraserhead, he picked a project that he thought Lynch might be interested in. After Lynch confirmed interest, Cornfeld, who was also an associate of Mel Brooks, took the idea to him thinking it would be a good venture for his newly founded Brooksfilm production company. Needing to be sold on the relatively unknown David Lynch, Brooks was advised to watch his debut feature, Eraserhead. Perhaps surprisingly, Mel Brooks took enough from his screening of Eraserhead to hire Lynch on the spot and put his full confidence in him to direct The Elephant Man. The chance Brooks took with David Lynch was monumental and put Lynch on the map. The Elephant Man was a huge success, nominated for eight Academy Awards, paving the way for Lynch to be able to continue his career in filmmaking. The partnership with Mel Brooks also allowed Lynch access to such a phenomenal cast including John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, and Anne Bancroft, Lynch had come a long way from selling newspapers to pay his cast. Despite many Hollywood producers being ill-prepared to properly respond to a film like Eraserhead, the artistic integrity was not lost on all, and the opportunity for David Lynch to flourish had just begun.One of the many positive qualities of David Lynch as a filmmaker is his ability to humanize even the oddest of his protagonists, thereby fostering an emotional connection between the audience and the characters in his film. Even the more minor characters in each of his films are given a human touch by David Lynch. Whether it's a distraught movie director who's casting decisions are being forced upon him, or a lounge singer embroiled in a kidnapping plot, each inhabitant in David Lynch's world is compassionately treated and given such human qualities, it is difficult to not become invested in the worlds he creates. Even in characters with such sparse dialogue as that of his feature film, their emotional essence is beautifully captured by Lynch. The audience is taken through a 14-minute trip before a word of dialogue is heard in Eraserhead, and after that, it's sparse until about the 30-minute mark. We are shown two socially inept individuals that seem to have little contact with the outside world. Despite their handicaps, however, Lynch shines a light on the aspects that make them similar to ourselves. We root for Henry and Mary, or at least want to see their suffering end, and that is credited to Lynch's ability to emotionally commit us to his characters. Lynch's gift of making such introspective cinema that allows the viewer to see at least aspects of themselves, in seemingly unrelatable characters, is invaluable. In The Elephant Man, Lynch's human touch was needed in multitudes to polish the animal-like John Merrick, who was routinely disregarded by those around him.I often think of The Elephant Man as Lynch's most human film. Perhaps that distinction should be shared with The Straight Story, the other linear oddity of David Lynch's oeuvre. Maybe it had to do with the plot-driven 'normal' timeline following of these two films that kept Lynch from going too far out into the weeds. Whether it was due to the structure or perhaps the source material, Lynch didn't seem to hide the fact that he was putting a passionate, deeply moving bend to the story of John Merrick. In the first meaningful experience the audience shares with Merrick, played expertly by John Hurt, we see him isolated and alone, kept from having any interaction with people, only to be gawked at as the imprisoned sideshow oddity. Merrick is treated as property, solely because he looks different. He is completely commodified for someone else's gain because it has been decided for him that he couldn't possibly have anything meaningful to contribute to society. By expressly showing us the disregard of Merrick, Lynch sets the tone for Merrick's retribution that is to come. By the time Anthony Hopkins' Frederick Treves happens upon John Merrick, Merrick has been conditioned not to trust anyone, as every person in his life has abandoned him, beaten him, or gawked at him. Treves, however, is committed to helping Merrick, so committed that he brings him into his family's home to the shock of his wife. Treves creates the most comfortable environment he can for Merrick at his new residence in the Royal London Hospital. Lynch utilizes several long takes, focusing on Treves' face, to show the audience the depth of his humanity, and his desire for Merrick to be treated as a person rather than some sort of freak. This focus on Treves humanizes him, making his character another humanly in-touch addition to the compassionate world Lynch creates. There are a number of key scenes throughout the film where Merrick is seen constructing a model of the cathedral that he can see the top of through his window. As more people that come into contact with him ask about his model, Lynch creates a beautiful moment wherein he highlights the importance of each person's individual perspective. Merrick can only see a portion of the cathedral, just like those who interacted with him could only see a part of John Merrick. No one would have expected that Merrick had the soul of a poet or a depth of feeling that he shared for those important to his life. Each person only saw Merrick's disfigurement and assumed from his appearance that he could not possibly possess a great capacity for thought. Of course, this was wrong, but Lynch exposes the reality that no one knows all parts of anyone else. Just as the window blocked the view of the lower half of the cathedral, there is in each of us aspects of our being that are unable to be seen by others. Creating an opportunity for self-reflection, Lynch again successfully adds a richly human element to his film. In many ways, I was reminded of the ways people would interact with Dougie in Twin Peaks: The Return. Like Dougie, John Merrick was shown heart and affection by those close to him while being blown off or gawked at by strangers. This similarity goes to show that, despite there being 40 years difference between the two works in Lynch's filmography, he has maintained a commitment to highlighting and respecting the emotional elements of humanity.I have encountered many people who look down on The Elephant Man as 'lesser Lynch', due to its coherent storyline and structure. It's not that these people don't care for the film, they just don't see as much of David Lynch's influence as in his other films. I've always been puzzled by this claim, as I see plenty of Lynch's touches throughout the film. The film is full of extreme close-ups of eyes, just like we see in Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. The opening of The Elephant Man is incredibly similar to that of Eraserhead, both in sound design and sequences of overlaid images. The camera lingers, often longer than the audience thinks it should, which is something Lynch has done in just about everything he's done. What stands out the most as uniquely Lynch, however, is the nightmarish sequences of Merrick's abuse. Lynch is a master of the nightmare, creating terrifying, unnerving sequences that stand from all of cinema. Lynch also cultivates an environment of isolation, of characters that are always, even if slightly, trepidatious of the world around them. Like only he can do, Lynch creates a world that is ugly on the outside, but beautiful within, echoing the mindset David Lynch seems to apply to all of his films, that 'people are frightened by what they don't understand.'",8,0,0,6 January 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Dog Day Afternoon
","If you have been a fan of any Al Pacino role and you have not seen Dog Day Afternoon, you have not yet experienced all that Al Pacino can offer. Dog Day Afternoon is by far Al Pacino's best work, and yes, I've seen The Godfather films. Sidney Lumet's 1975 feature Dog Day Afternoon showcases a depth of Al Pacino that I was unaware existed. Also starring John Cazale, Dog Day Afternoon explores the debilitating feeling of being torn in two directions by the world around you. The crisis one may confront by not being able to live their identity pushes Al Pacino's Sonny to rob a bank in order to get the money for his lover's sex-change operation. Gritty, raw, and soul-crushing, Lumet proves his directorial force while bringing out the best in Al Pacino to illustrate the depths one will go through to save himself by saving those around him.On a hot summer day in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) set out to execute their plan to rob the Chase Manhattan Bank. After weeks of combing over their plans, coordinating delivery times, casing the outside and learning the best times to attract the least amount of attention, they finally enter the bank. Sonny is at a time of extreme desperation in his life. He experiences a listless home life with his wife and two kids, and he desperately wants to rob enough money from the bank to afford his partner Leon's (Chris Sarandon) sex change operation so the two may live together full-time. Sal, the understated partner in crime, an apathetic man, seems to have no direction in his life and is easily brought into the scheme by the promise of riches from the heist. The bank manager and teller staff agree to not interfere with the robbery, even helping the downtrodden robbers as best as they can. Thinking it will be a quick in and out affair, Sonny and Sal are rushing through the job until they realize that there is little money in the bank, as a majority of the money was taken out of the bank that same afternoon. Before they can escape, a call comes in from the police department that they have the bank surrounded. What began as a robbery quickly develops into a hostage situation as Sonny sees his plans foil all around him. Eventually, feeling sorry for the men who continuously vow not to hurt anyone, if they even could, a kinship develops between Sonny, Sal, and the bank employees. Now seeing the only way out as a jet out of the country in exchange for the safe release of hostages, Sonny unwillingly turns into a captor continuously negotiating the release of hostages and listing demands. At the depths of his own despair, Sonny prepares for the worst while hoping that he can still manage to make a life out of the mess he had before he ever stepped into the bank.This is one of those films that you watch and you hardly realize there are any other actors in it besides Al Pacino, he steals the show that much. Within the first 10 minutes, you could see the nuance brimming over the top of Pacino's characterization of Sonny. The most incredible part of this film, which also shows the directorial prowess of Sidney Lumet, was that by the 10-minute mark the duo had already entered the bank. A film that jumps into the action so early in the film may easily fall victim to poor pacing, especially considering that this is a film that takes place largely in one place. The pacing was never a problem in Dog Day Afternoon; each wrenching minute that elapsed emerged the audience even deeper into the mindset of Sonny and the desperation he was experiencing. I am a huge fan of films that take place in one setting, and I never thought I would like one more than I liked 12 Angry Men, also by Sidney Lumet, (obviously it's time for me to watch even more of his films) but Dog Day Afternoon takes the crown of best one setting film, in my book anyway. One setting films are so hard to do well, oftentimes, they come off stiff or too theatre-like, but Lumet knew what he was doing behind a camera leaving audiences with the best in the genre. You feel the desperation of Pacino's portrayal in such a way that stays with you days after viewing. Dog Day Afternoon is a standout, more than earning all of its critical acclaims. What a miss for Pacino from the Academy that year!",10,2,2,26 August 2016
Amadeus," 'I speak for all mediocrities in the world, I am their champion.'
","Amadeus opens with the suicide attempt of Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) leading to a confession that has been weighing on his heart for years. Salieri, a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), lived his life insanely jealous of his exceptionally gifted counterpart. Salieri confesses to the Priest sent to converse with him after his suicide attempt, that he devised several plans in order to stunt Mozart's success. Salieri was fiercely jealous of Mozart's ability, and how seemingly natural that ability came to him, as Salieri devoted his life to composition mastery yet couldn't hold a candle to Mozart's compositions. Salieri promised his chastity to God in hopes of being imparted the gift of music by the hand of Christ. Salieri enjoys a comfortable living and career as court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The envy of Salieri eventually engulfs his entire being; he is dumbfounded as to why God could choose such an immature, petulant child to instill his most precious musical talents in. His envy has led Salieri to wage a war against the Christ he devoted his life to, and an urgency to bring about the downfall of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Amadeus is a beautifully striking film, thanks in no small part to its reliance on natural lighting. Amadeus was filmed solely using natural lighting and it benefits immensely from this choice. Amadeus taught me that lighting in a film can have the most dramatic impact, even acting as a character on its own. I am moved by the lighting every time I watch the film, and it is my favorite part of revisiting it. Amadeus achieves a curious feat, it is a biopic in which one cares little about biographic inaccuracies. There are no historical records to indicate that the relationship between Salieri and Mozart was contentious as it appears to be on screen, yet, the story is so engaging that the audience is not tallying the mistakes the film makes. It's more than an engaging story, however, that keeps the audience from becoming upset at the miscues the film fires; Amadeus strikes the delicate balance of giving each principle character their due in the film. Mozart and Salieri are deeply flawed, yet gifted individuals and Foreman brilliantly expresses both sides of each man. Salieri makes a deal with God at a young age promising to devote his life fully to Christ in exchange for divine inspiration of his musical compositions. Salieri begins his devotion by solely studying music and vows to remain chaste, exercising extreme monastic-like discipline in his daily life. Salieri is pleased with the gifts he feels have been handed to him by Christ until he becomes aware of the superior expertise of Mozart. Salieri becomes obsessed with the idea of Mozart and anticipates the day in which he can meet the one God has given such musical talent to. When he finally meets Mozart, Salieri is shocked and disgusted by how juvenile the prodigy is. The interesting aspect of Salieri's repugnance is that he is so revolted by Mozart's childlike behavior, yet his fixation on the composer comes across like a son and outshone by his father's (God's) favorite child. Salieri knows he does not possess the talent Mozart does, yet believes himself to be more deserving of the superior talents. He begins to unwind right before the audience's eyes, decomposing from the realization that he has lived a life promised to another, yet, intensely unfulfilled. It is this great multi-layered portrayal of a jilted man that earned F. Murray Abraham an Academy Award for his role as Salieri; the role also won a Tony for Ian McKellen's brilliant portrayal of Salieri on Broadway. F. Murray Abraham played the part wonderfully and deserves each of the many accolades he received for his turn in the role. The standout for me, however, is the multi-faceted Tom Hulce. Hulce plays the childlike, workaholic, unsophisticated, professional composer. The rapid-fire shifts between facets of the boy genius are extremely well-acted by Hulce. A performance that necessitated so many opposite mindsets is no easy feat, yet one Hulce mastered with ease. As brilliant as Abraham and Hulce were in their roles, it would have been interesting to see Ian McKellen and Tim Curry reprising their stage roles in this film. (I wonder why neither were selected to star in the film having given acclaimed performances on Broadway) Amadeus has a myriad of factors that could work against it. The film is three hours long, is narrated, involves heavily on flashbacks, and shows several compositions-operas mostly, of the featured composer's works. Yet, given the issues that may arise from these aspects of the film, Amadeus does not suffer for them. Amadeus is excellently paced, brilliantly illustrated through narrated flashbacks providing an in-depth look at the people involved in the story, and are wonderfully brought to life by seeing the pieces the composers worked so tirelessly on. Salieri referred to Mozart's natural music ability as if he had been picked to take musical dictation from God, this seemed to be supported when Salieri saw original copies of Mozart's work that showed no marks of corrections or signs of error. As Salieri is working with Mozart, he is taking dictation from the ailing Mozart, and having trouble keeping up with him or even understanding what he is to write; Mozart can hear the melodies he is creating in his head, a skill in which Salieri does not possess. It is never clearer than in his final moments with Mozart that Salieri, while being a gifted composer, has nowhere near the natural aptitude of his counterpart, Mozart. Given that the film is told from Salieri's forsaken viewpoint, Amadeus is a narrative that explores the raw emotion of a man who devoted his life to an art form that abandoned him and is the most painfully beautiful illustration of such I have ever seen.",10,1,2,16 November 2016
The Game," The Game
","David Fincher is a highly celebrated modern director responsible for a few modern-day classics, as well as the 1997 film, The Game. Fincher is one that I have struggled with. Some of his films make it easy to see their greatness, while others seem overrated, to me. The Game starring Michael Douglas as a rich investment banker looking for a break from his life shows interest in a mysterious game his brother informs him about. A mystery folded within an exercise in personal revelation, The Game never quite delivers on either message it promises. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a wealthy investment banker living in San Fransisco who enjoys his time alone more than he enjoys crowding his life with an abundance of people. He has even become rather estranged from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn). When Conrad tells his brother about an unusual game he can play, then gives him a gift certificate to partake in the game for a birthday present, Nicholas is intrigued. Nicholas is constantly haunted by memories of his father's suicide, and these flashbacks have intensified the closer it gets to Nicholas's 48th birthday, as that was the year his father ended his life. Seeking a refuge from his life and the constant flashbacks, Nicholas begins to investigate taking part in the game. Almost immediately after his entry to the game, Nicholas endures trauma and troubles in every aspect of his life. His professional life, his personal life, and even his safety have all become uncertain as the lines between reality and the game become too vague to discern.The Game presented a unique premise but perhaps was a bit too far- fetched. The elaborate measures one endures while taking part in the game, up to and including being abandoned for dead in Mexico yet unable to trace, beg for more than a suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience member. The film also has a serious pacing problem. Tightening up the narrative and reducing the run time by about 30 minutes would have been a great benefit to the audience. The film really starts to slog about just after the halfway point, becoming easy for one to lose both interest and intrigue. I read a reading of the film that presents it as a modern-day retelling of A Christmas Carol. I have difficulties with this reading because there is not enough establishment of Douglas's character as a bad person before he starts playing the game. Scrooge, in A Christmas Carol, is quite obviously a curmudgeonly fellow, obsessed with profits and his own gain. Douglas's Nicholas, however, comes off as a man successful in his field who appears broken by the looming memories of his father's death. Without a clear identity of Douglas as a man we are supposed to dislike due to his business practices, it's difficult to watch his livelihood taken away from him due to a sick game. I came off disliking the seemingly heroic Conrad than I ever disliked Nicholas. The Game falters on its premise and suffers from too little establishment of what is apparently supposed to be an unlikeable character, which is a unique problem in a film in which pacing is such a slog.",4,1,2,3 May 2017
Coyote Ugly," Coyote Ugly
","David McNally directed the sexually charged Coyote Ugly at the turn of the millennium. His film starred Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia in the familiar tale of a girl leaving her small town to try to make it in the big city. If you're thinking 'I've seen this storyline before, do I need to see Coyote Ugly' the answer is no. The film is just as boring and formulaic as it seems despite girls dancing on top of bars while pouring pitchers of water on themselves--I suddenly realize why the film grossed so much. Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is tired of waiting tables at a diner in her small town in New Jersey and only writing her music part-time. She is ready to make the leap to nearby New York and begin the pursuit of her songwriting endeavors full-time. After finishing her last shift at the diner and getting a wonderful send off from her friends, Violet goes home to pack the car for the move. Her father, Bill (John Goodman) is reluctant to let his only daughter loose in The Big Apple, and it's clear that she has taken a parental role over her father since her mother's death years prior. He eventually is as supportive as he can be with her departure. After arriving at the run-down apartment which is all she can afford, Violet's best friend Gloria (Melanie Lynskey) hides money in Violet's freezer that she is reluctant to take. After several disappointments in trying to get the mixtapes of her songs to studios and agents, Violet finds herself disappointed and rejected. When she returns home to find her apartment ransacked and her belongings stolen Violet cries and questions whether or not she should return home. While out for a slice of pie to drown her sorrows, Violet overhears a conversation between several girls waving money around at a nearby table. Violet gathers that they are 'coyotes' working at a nearby bar. Following the bread crumbs she has sniffed out, Violet seeks the bar out looking for a quick way to make a lot of money. Violet is initially stunned to find out that the bar she has happened upon is a city hotspot in which the girls comprise a team of sexy women who entice patrons to pay for the show they put on. The rest of the girls can sniff out Violet's small-town upbringing, but what they can't sniff out is the passion for her dreams that will push her to do whatever it takes to succeed. Oh, of course, there is a love interest that initially looks like it's not going to work out.Of course, she's from a small town and wants to move to a big city, of course, she's the parental figure in her single parent home, of course, her apartment gets broken into, of course she loses everything she's saved for months, of course her friend from back home left money in the freezer, of course she overheard that there would be a position open at the bar, of course she was too shy to dance on top of a bar, of course she had outdated technology making it near impossible to adequately get her art distributed, of course, she had a love interest that she was reluctant towards, of course, she had stage fright--except when she was with the coyotes, and of course she eventually made it. I'm not kidding when I say this is one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen in my life. It's also aged horribly and was difficult to watch, as most films that prominently feature technology, clothes, and music. Throughout the entire film, when I'm supposed to be buying into how hard this beautiful white woman's life is, I kept asking myself, 'how hard can your life really be, you have perfect hair--if all else fails, shampoo commercials. A film as predictable and lazy as this just has nowhere to land with me, and few redeeming qualities about it, with the exception of John Goodman, he's always good--certainly the bright spot of this pile of garbage.",1,0,1,24 March 2017
Back to the Future Part III," No one's future is written for them
","Sitting back to watch the final, for now, entry in the Back to the Future trilogy, I was a little disheartened. I had a lot of fun with this series, and was sad not to be traveling through the dimensions of time with Marty and Doc Brown for the last time. But alas, all good things must come to an end, and of course, I can always rent the DVD, or perhaps even add any of them to my own collection. Back to the Future Part III, didn't simply 'phone it in' for its' final act, it provided a complete compilation to its time travel exploits.This story picks up where the second left off; with Marty (Michael J. Fox) acting on a letter he received from Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). At the conclusion of Back to the Future Part II, the DeLorean is struck by lightning, with Doc inside, and he is transported all the way back to 1885, in the old west. Since Doc had always dreamed of living in the Wild West, he was not severely disappointed to be stuck in the 1800's, and he certainly was stuck because it would be 70 or so years before the replacement parts he needed to repair the DeLorean would exist. He writes Marty a letter explaining to him what he is up to and that he is fine and should be left in 1885. Soon after receiving the letter, however, Marty uncovers that Doc Brown is about to die. Unwilling to leave him to that fate, Marty ignores all risks, intent on traveling to 1885, to find Doc Brown. This would prove impossible without a trip back to 1955, to get some help from the Doc Brown of the past. Marty's crash landing in 1885 creates quite a conundrum, however, as a fuel line breaks causing all of the gas to leak out of the DeLorean. Doc reminds him that gas hasn't been invented yet, and they will have to be innovative to find a way to power the DeLorean to the necessary 88 M.P.H. needed to travel through time. After devising a plan to power the DeLorean by locomotive power, a new distraction, of a feminine nature arrives. A Ms. Clara Clayton greets Doc Brown, and he is instantly smitten by her. Doc even vows to stay in the past with Clara after helping Marty fix the DeLorean. Our Heroes situation is made even more difficult because Marty, in typical McFly fashion refuses to be called 'chicken', or 'yellow' in 1885 terms. After an altercation with Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty gains the attention of the gun that he discovered was to kill Doc. In the final installment of Robert Zemeckis beloved time traveling adventure, out duo is outrunning a gun, deciding between love and fate, and learning that the words of others should only ever be words rather than a reflection of ourselves; a pleasing finale to the Back to the Future series.Once again, the brilliant on-screen chemistry of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd bring Back to the Future Part III to life. Years working together on the same franchise were nothing to dilute the pair's on-screen chemistry. Still as engaging as ever, it was pure joy to watch Marty and Doc on screen again, one last time. This film also kept the heart in to the movie. Each entry in this trilogy has heart at the center, no pun intended. It was endearing to see our zany Doc Brown fall in love, even if he did wish to pick his new love over traveling with Marty.I would recommend Back to the Future Part III to almost anyone. Rated PG, it is appropriate and engaging for all ages. Fans of the trilogy have to see it, as it wraps up all of our favorite's story lines. Anyone who believes in the power of love, time, and destiny will feel empowered by the message. I'm not sure what type of viewer Couldn't find something to appreciate about Back to the Future Part III, and to me, that's exactly how a franchise should end; pleasing the one time viewer and the series fanatic alike.",8,7,7,14 January 2016
Patton," I've been here before
","Franklin J. Schaffner churned out the 1970 Best Picture winner, Patton, starring George C. Scott and Karl Malden. A wartime film about the harsh no-nonsense life of General George S. Patton, with George C. Scott in the titular role. Perhaps best known for the intensely moving speech at the beginning of the film delivered by the general, Patton explores one man's seeming love affair with all things related to war. It was an interesting ride, to say the least, of viewing 1970's top film, according to the Academy.The film opens in WWII and shows General Patton's (George C. Scott) career as a tank commander progressing through the invasion of Europe. Eventually highlighting the fall of the Third Reich, Patton shows one wartime successful, yet bizarre man who believes he has lived before. At one of his exploits he explains that he has been reincarnated to the General he is now, but lived before in the time of the great Roman empire; Patton even believes he fought in battle on behalf of the Romans. No one is ever able to pinpoint the General's character. He is stern one moment, jovial the next, always shifting between his idiosyncracies with the blink of an eye. With each 'victory' Patton gains in battles, the more inflated his ego becomes. The larger Patton's ego becomes, the more talking he does, the more talking he does, the more trouble he gets into. Patton eventually becomes a far too controversial figure to have around and begins to realize that the once great commander must now accept a life in which he is no longer needed to serve his former post. Through all the transitions he goes through, Patton learns the ultimate lesson; glory, even for the best, is always fleeting.This movie was strange. I understood without the constant show of it that Patton was a different sort of individual. I always applaud a movie that gets its point across about characters or issues in the story line without drilling it into the audience. A good 40 minutes could have been cut out of trying to convince me that there is something 'off' with Patton; his opening speech made this abundantly clear. I will say that the acting of George C. Scott was phenomenal. The Academy definitely got it right, giving top acting honors to Scott that year. Karl Malden was great in this film, as well. Who doesn't like Karl Malden? He's such a seemingly down-to-earth actor that just exudes happiness, and it's hard for me not to love him in every role I see him in. In Patton, he plays General Omar N. Bradley, the newly appointed 2nd in command under General Patton. Malden does a great job towing the line between following his commanding officer, yet realizing Patton's flaws and being weary of them. Directorial achievement must be noted for Franklin J. Schaffner. Since Patton's introduction to the film, he commanded each scene he was in, elevating his image and making even the audience worry about what he'll do next.Patton is a must see for history buffs. Anyone that has any prior knowledge of the general would enjoy the film, even if it is the slimmed down version of the man's life and triumphs. Patton is also a must see for any fans of war movies. The battle scenes in this film are on a grand scale and deeply resonate with the audience. As far as from an Academy standpoint; I haven't seen any of the films nominated for top prize of 1970, but there were parts of Patton that stand out to show it as the best.",6,0,2,11 February 2016
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Dr.
","No piece of art has ever had as profound an impact on my life than Mulholland Dr. I say, in a very literal way, that Mulholland Dr. changed my life.I had never looked at cinema as an art form before, I actually had hardly looked at cinema before. I grew up in a single parent home with a childhood filled with independence and responsibility. Needless to say, there was no time for films or television. I was that person on the other side of mouth open stares hearing 'how have you never seen (insert film name here)' I don't begrudge my childhood, I read a lot and enjoyed time with my friends, started working at a young age and never through about movies much. I was always out of the pop culture loop all the way through high school. I worked more than full-time in politics before college which led me to start my undergraduate work when I was 20. I took enough credits to need a signature from an academic adviser and in all the hustle of meetings and trying to gain approval for taking on so many hours I had forgotten even signing up for what I thought the most inconsequential class would be: Introduction to Film Studies. Mulholland Dr., which many consider David Lynch's masterpiece, is even gaining traction as one of the best films ever made. Released in 2001, Mulholland Dr. stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. The film follows a woman after a car accident leaves her amnesiac with her only lifeline being a naive woman who just moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of being an actress after winning a dance contest in her hometown. The longer the two women are together the more they discover more about the murder attempt against the amnesiac woman who has taken to calling herself Rita (Laura Harring) Her naive friend Betty (Naomi Watts) looks at the whole ordeal as an adventure despite the fact that Rita's life hangs in the balance. Rita is even willing to put her acting dreams aside to attend to Rita and engage in some amateur sleuthing. From my first viewing, I have never cared whether or not I understood what was going on in Mulholland Dr., nor did I ever look at the plot as a puzzle that needed to be pieced together. I enjoy what David Lynch does with his art and am pleased to simply experience his output. Of course, at this point in my life, I have whizzed through Lynch's entire filmography multiple times, and even through Mulholland Dr. isn't my favorite Lynch film, I have no problem admitting that it is probably his masterpiece. Lynch was on another level. Every aspect, each scene is perfect visual mastery. The one place that I find the most resistance to the perfection of the film are the people who claim that the opening scene is 'weird for the sake of being weird' and unnecessary to the film. I wholeheartedly disagree with that assessment. The scene shows an insight into just how naive Betty was because we see her seem to truly believe that winning this dance contest was going to open doors in Hollywood for her. One of my favorite aspects of David Lynch's work is the fact that throughout his entire filmography you can see a similar thread running through each of his features yet he is not that director that is trying to recreate any of his previous films. I appreciate the newness of each of Lynch's films yet the familiarity of what I love about his work. I can't think of a more introspective filmmaker more capable of exploring an individual's failings in life and how it could have played out differently had career aspirations been realized better than David Lynch. The way in which he displays repressed fears and mixes past and present, proving part of our memories to be false is not only an exceptional example of filmmaking but an exceptional example of artistry. It's incredible, on paper, nothing about Mulholland Dr. seems as if it will make sense, yet the complete product is perfect. The seamless way Lynch transitions between two realizations of a life is incredible. David Lynch is my all-time favorite filmmaker, yet, I find that I must be in the proper mindset to enjoy many of his films. Mulholland Dr., however, while it is not my favorite Lynch film, is one that I can watch anytime and will always be all-in on. Fun fact: my personal favorite tracking shot in cinema history is tucked inside Mulholland Dr., the shot into Club Silencio is just beautiful. The whole film is incredible, and I firmly believe it is one of the best films of all-time. I don't know what my life would be like if I hadn't accidentally ended up in a film class on a semester when a Lynch film was being screened. I became a cinephile because of Mulholland Dr. and I couldn't be more thankful to Lynch and his art for inspiring that change in my existence. I am so thankful to David Lynch for Mulholland Dr., more thankful to David Lynch for Eraserhead, and the most thankful to David Lynch for bringing cinema alive to my eyes and heart.I never did take that Shakespeare course, but I did take three more film studies courses. Thank you David Lynch.",10,5,7,30 May 2017
Annie Hall," I luff you, two 'f's'
","I am, unapologetically so, a big fan of Woody Allen's work. Annie Hall, directed by Allen in 1977, was one of the great masterworks of his career. Starring Woody Allen, and Diane Keaton in the titular role, Annie Hall presents the lives of socially awkward, incredibly neurotic individuals, who are perfect only for each other, from the beginning to the end of their relationship. Woody Allen always injects a bit of himself in each film he has directed, Annie Hall, however, may be the most self-actualizing of Allen's films that audiences have ever seen. Idiosyncracies and nuances commonly known to be those of Allen's himself, give the audiences an insight into one of the most famed directors of our time.Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) has the only career he could possibly have, he is a comedian. Not that Alvy isn't intelligent, he is, or that he isn't capable of doing anything else, he would be, it's just that Alvy is an incredibly introspective and pensive individual who uses his own self-realizations to influence his comedy. At the beginning of the film, the audience learns that Alvy has broken up with the titular character and the succeeding film is his exploration of that relationship, in hopes to discover why it ended. Alvy is so stricken by the ending of his relationship with Annie because he truly believes that his 15+ years of psychological analysis has solved his problems which should have ensured his relationship with Annie would last. On the surface, the high-brow New Yorker Alvy, and the flighty Midwestern-born Annie would have no success in a union, yet, their peculiarities were such that they ended up being perfect for each other, or so it seemed. Perhaps it's his much discussed Jewish guilt or just his introspective nature, but Alvy just can't let go of his relationship with Annie Hall until he has come to a logical reason for why it ended. The introspective nature which Allen used as a vehicle for Annie Hall was brilliant and surely added to the host of reasons in which Annie Hall took Oscar's top prize for 1977. Annie Hall does something movies rarely get away with by breaking the 4th wall. Annie Hall breaks the wall so perfectly because the breaks add to the film, rather than take the audience away from the film. The technical aspects of this movie make it a dream to watch. The film is done almost exclusively using long takes, which are gutsy, but suited the conversational nature of Annie Hall to perfection. Another great technical attribute of mention is the title cards to input English on the 'foreign language' scene on the roof. The script in which Allen penned in cooperation with Marshall Brickman was pure cinematic gold. One of my favorite scenes of all- time is contained within this film; the scene in which Alvy and Annie are in line at a movie theater and a guest behind them is loudly giving his sanctimonious opinion of the film in which they are about to see. Alvy is unable to hold his tongue any longer as the diatribe continues and he interrupts the gentleman to give his opinion, point out the flaws in his argument, and introduce him to the writer of the source material to further prove how wrong he was. This moment, though it happened only in Alvy's mind, was perfect, because who hasn't this happened to? Speaking of relatability, Alvy's character is one in which most everyone can relate to. Though probably not all of Alvy's mannerisms are present in one person at any given time, there are certainly many idiosyncracies one can identify in themselves that is present on screen in Allen's Alvy. As noted, I am a huge fan of Woody Allen's work. His ability to pull the worst parts of himself and humanity from his own being and put it on screen for others to realize they also possess are extraordinary. I can't think of any other modern director who nails the human aspects in their films like Allen can. Everything about Annie Hall works, even the parts that shouldn't. The split-screens, the breaking of the wall, the 'meeting the past' it all works the way Allen puts it together. Has there ever been any criticism of this film? I'm sure there has been, I'm just not aware of it. It is for good reason Annie Hall won Best Picture, Best Director, a Best Actor nod for Allen, and Best Original Screenplay; and one doesn't even have to be a fan of Allen's work in order to appreciate his master work, Annie Hall.",10,1,2,21 November 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Space Odyssey
","Well, my mind was officially blown by my second undertaking of a Stanley Kubrick feature. Being a huge fan of auteur David Lynch, I was greatly looking forward to watching another film of Kubrick's. Before this viewing, I had only seen The Shining (and who hasn't) so I was ready for more Kubrick. This 1968 Sci-fi epic starring Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and William Sylvester tells the cautionary tale of modernization and the advancement of technology, and what that advancement means for the human race. When a group of astronauts is sent into deep space, they realize the horrors of the possibility of technology taking over humanity. Dr. Heyward Floyd (William Sylvester) eagerly and hastily sets up another deep space mission which he provides little public details of to those around him. Dr. Floyd hurried to the Florida launch station with his guarded secret to attend a meeting with a top official that would get his project off the ground. He then learns that a discovery has been made below the moon's crest that predates human existence. Energized by this undebatable proof of extraterrestrial life, Heyward assembles a group of scientists to investigate the phenomenon, only to be turned away by the piercing scream of a magnetic disturbance once they arrive at the scene. The conscious members on board the mission are Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), they are on the trip with other members 'hibernating' until they reach Jupiter. Hal 9000, an artificially intelligent supercomputer maintained many ship functions and interacted with the crew daily. After a series of events in which Hal attempts to cease communication with Earth, the crew decides to disconnect Hal fearing their isolation from Earth. Sensing the emerging disdain of the crew, Hal attempts to cause the death of the crew to protect its own operating system. A fight between man and machine ensues and the battle can only be won by willpower, and endurance, and which party can overcome the crippling fear of isolation. I was glad I was forewarned about the need to 'stick with' this film. It opens with a 20 minute plus sequence that felt like I had strapped in for a Nat. Geo. documentary. The audience is 25 minutes into the film before there is any dialogue, which was an incredible feat for a modern film. The sound completely takes over the film overwhelming the audience with its ever presence. The sound acts as an independent character revealing the slow deterioration of the crew involved in the mission. So incredible was the sound that it is almost enough to drive the audience crazy, akin to the characters who are mentally declining as the film progresses. When there was more than hollow noise and high, shrill moans, there was an overabundance of Strauss music, adding to the out of this world experience of the mission. The acting in this film was wonderful, with the strongest performance being the unseen Hal 9000 who commands the picture. The cinematography is nothing short of masterful, and I realized quickly why Stanley Kubrick's direction is so oft cited as brilliance. The sets were so intricate and grandiose that they added to the mysticism and realism of a space ship flying through the galaxy. The colors are also spectacular adding to the brilliance of the plot. Kubrick, in a display of his directorial prowess, utilizes the most inventive camera angles I have ever seen, creating an unimaginative level of depth to his film. Kubrick is certainly an auteur and one that I can't wait to explore more of. Isolation is a force in which can bring the most intense human behavior. Silence and being alone can lead to the mental decomposition in even the strongest of individuals. The intensity of isolation was fully explored in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Hal 900 seeks dominance, and the overtaking of humans by artificial intelligence has been a fear of humanity since the Industrial Revolution. The battle between Hal and the human members of the crew was waged over the overwhelming isolation and fear of being replaced by the other. The evolution of humanity has injected new fears into our psyche, and few directors could have brought that war and vision to life; thankfully, Stanley Kubrick took the task, and left audiences with nothing less than film mastery.",9,4,11,27 April 2016
The Graduate," The pursuit towards fulfillment never really ends
","I rarely rewatch films I don't care for, largely because I rarely rewatch films in general. A movie has to be special or captivating to reel me in for multiple viewings. I usually have the mindset that there are so many films I want to see, I have to constantly tread new ground in order to hopefully see them all. On occasion, however, especially if a film is well-loved, I'll give it another try and attempt to see anything I may have missed. Seldom have I been as rewarded by such a rewatch as I was with Mike Nichols 1967 film, The Graduate. Following the point in time in a young man's life that if often aimless, that time immediately following college graduation, Nichols does an exceptional job at conveying the listlessness of spirit once ones expected education level is completed. Caught between deciding between marriage and graduate school while his parent's expectations pressure him, Benjamin finds avoiding the decision as long as possible to be the option he is most content with. Starring Dustin Hoffman, in a breakout role, and the incomparable Anne Bancroft, The Graduate is a thoughtful look at the expectations of others and the soul-searching one has to contend with throughout their lives. Just home from college after his recent graduation, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is ready to relax after finishing his studies and fill his days by his parent's pool. With no romantic interests or jobs waiting for him, his father pushes him to go to graduate school, and his mother encourages him to go on more dates. Benjamin comes from an upscale neighborhood, and the parents of his friends, all of whom expect him to further his education, wait to hear of a graduate school announcement, all of them except Mrs. Robinson. A friend of his parents, Mrs. Robinson is a beautiful and lonely woman who has a daughter near Benjamin's age. That doesn't stop her from propositioning him and prompting him to 'sow one's wild oats' while he still has the chance. Surprised and startled by her suggestion, the inexperienced Benjamin attempts to avoid the Robinson's all together before eventually giving in to carrying on a tryst with the family's matriarch. Despite the situation remaining strenuous for Benjamin, as he feels bad for keeping something of this magnitude from his parents, the two carry on both seeming to be fulfilled in some way by the other. As time wears on, and Benjamin seems to be no closer to starting graduate school or getting married, his parents set him up with none other than the Robinson's daughter. This clearly throws a wrench into the lives of both Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, leaving the former no other choice but to begin making some decisions about his life. Perhaps, part of the reason that I didn't initially like The Graduate when I first watched it, is because I don't care for Dustin Hoffman. I can almost never get beyond him to enjoy the characters he creates. Interestingly, Hoffman was initially going to pass on an audition for the film because he was already committed to playing Leo Bloom in the Mel Brooks production, The Producers. So certain that he wouldn't be selected in the role as the suitor of his wife, Anne Bancroft, Mel Brooks released Dustin Hoffman to audition for The Graduate. As much as I may have enjoyed this more the first time with someone besides Hoffman in the lead role, I'm of course thrilled that this paved the way for Gene Wilder's first strong screen role in THe Producers. I appreciated Hoffman's performance much more this time around, as he seemed to embody the character of someone uncomfortably trying to make their way through life, seemingly unsure of anything. The Graduate begins where Say Anything...ends. Cameron Crowe's excellent directorial debut features a high school senior unsure of what direction to take his life after graduation. The Graduate begins with a long take on a young man with no direction who has just finished college, as he took the route that was expected of him. In my mind, a cinematic universe exists where Lloyd Dobler and Benjamin Braddock are the same person, endlessly wandering through life aimlessly. I anxiously anticipate a post-marriage sequel, perhaps dealing with the pitfalls of a dead-end job or unfulfilling career, I'm flexible. The soundtrack of Graduate is sensational, made up of Simon & Garfunkel songs, perfectly accompanying the mood of Benjamin Braddock. The film was also shot in a powerful way, with Benjamin's face, and the faces of those he communicates with, often obstructed excellently symbolizing the many things that hinder his life and complicate his decision-making. The character introduction of Mrs. Robinson is beautifully communicated thanks to Anne Bancroft. Embodying the perfect balance of unattainable eminence and fragile regret, Bancroft perfectly exposes both aspects of her character. Making herself at home in Benjamin's room where he retreated to for a moment of quiet introspection, Mrs. Robinson shows her strength and control over the situation. It is instantly clear to see that she knows exactly how her relationship with Benjamin is going to play out. She seems to feed off of his discomfort, never being setback by his initial refusal of her advances. Mrs. Robinson's character is fully fleshed out. She is disappointed in herself for giving up everything she wanted in exchange for the chains of matrimony and motherhood. Benjamin isn't the only one searching for something in life. Mrs. Robinson, who finds her motherly duties nearly complete as her daughter prepares to attend college, and her duties as a wife often ignored by her husband who seems to always be inexplicably absent from their residence. Her character, in conjunction with Benjamin's, goes to show that, as human beings, we are always searching for something just beyond our grasp, and no amount of seeming contentment ever really puts an end to that search.",9,1,1,8 January 2018
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain
","Having never seen Singin' in the Rain, I was not about to pass up the chance to see it on the big screen as part of TCM's collaboration with Fathom Events to bring such classics to theatres. I'm a young classic film fan, so I never had a chance to see these films as they were intended to be seen. Singin' in the Rain is one of those films that begs to be seen on 50-foot screen with surround sound. The 1952 film turns 65 this year and is just as pertinent now as it ever was. Starring Gene Kelly and his rapid-fire feet, alongside the recently departed Debbie Reynolds in the film that takes an inside look at making it in Hollywood, Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain was the most fun I could have possibly had on a Sunday afternoon. The year is 1927, there are murmurs around the studio system that a film company has been toying with synchronous sound. For Monument Pictures, however, those murmurs go ignored as they are firmly focused on the stars making the studio prosper. On-screen couple Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are audience favorites of the silent screen. Although their relationship is strictly for the screen only, Monument Pictures has let it leak to the gossip columns that they are an off-screen couple as well, believing it would boost their already stellar ratings. Behind closed doors, however, Don can't stand Lina, and the dim-witted Lina thinks she and Don are truly engaged. The two have gotten used to the mobs of fans they encounter at every turn as each of their pictures proves more successful than the last. When The Jazz Singer, the first talkie is released, Monument Pictures must make some quick adjustments in order to keep up with the Hollywood evolution. When the technology proves too much to learn in too short a time span, studio heads think they might be sunk. The major problem facing the two stars is Lina's voice. Lina has a voice that makes one long for fingernails scratching along a chalkboard. If Lina is heard talking on screen, no one will likely come to a Lockwood-Lamont film ever again. Fortunately for the duo, Don's new love interest, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) has a fantastic voice, and as much as Don despises the idea, it is planned that she will record Lina's parts, dubbing Lina's voice, for one film only. When a jealous Lina intervenes and attempts to trap Kathy to permanently dubbing her voice, therefore ruining any career Kathy might have, Don won't have it. Plotting a daring and dangerous stunt that could ruin all careers involved, Don pulls off the ultimate sacrifice for Kathy. The 2012 Best Picture winner, The Artist; a film that I happen to love, takes many cues from Singin' in the Rain. Several times throughout the film I was reminded by The Artist, and anytime a film can do that, at the very least, I will be a pleased audience member. Aside from Singin' in the Rain clearly influencing The Artist, the film is wonderful in its own right. With some of the most wonderful cinematography I have ever seen, and in glorious technicolor, Singin' in the Rain is a visually stunning masterpiece. I have never seen a better-written musical than Singin' in the Rain. The witty dialogue scattered throughout the film keeps one engaged even when there is no on-screen theatrics filling the screen. Gene Kelly is an actor in which I, like everyone else have heard about endlessly. I had not seen much of Kelly's work, however, with only a couple exceptions and I can promise that will change. His dancing is inspiring and completely captivating. I prefer the graceful flair of Fred Astaire, but Kelly has risen in my book after this film. The chemistry was perfect, the film was beautiful, and it is no wonder why Singin' in the Rain is being brought back for theatre screenings 65 years after its debut.",9,0,1,16 January 2017
Chariots of Fire," Chariots of Fire
","As an avid runner, I was more than excited to see Chariots of Fire, I was also perplexed as to why I hadn't seen it yet. Needless to say, I had high hopes for the 1981 Best Picture winner directed by Hugh Hudson. Unfortunately, I found myself largely disappointed. The look of the film was incredible. I have said it before, and will undoubtedly say it after today; I love film. I mean, I love movies shot on film. You don't get the look, like the one achieved in Chariots of Fire with digital films. When the film can lend so much to the story, like the gritty look achieved in the opening shot to distinguish the characters; the film is almost like a character itself. But enough of my monologue of the importance of the Film Preservation Society.Chariots of Fire tells the story of two naturally-gifted British sprinters, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross). The story depicts how differently the athletes use their gifts in their respective lives. Abrahams, a Lithuanian practitioner of Judaism runs to cope with how different his Judaism makes him feel. Often looked down upon, his running prowess eventually garners him national respect and admiration. Conversely, Eric, the son of missionaries sees running as a way to enjoy notoriety and eventually get back into missionary work himself. The acting in this film is fine, the story was solid, the pacing was too slow, and the purpose was lost. I am starting to see why I have waited so long to see the remaining Best Picture winners. Ben Cross, although he had a sympathetic character, overacted his plight, for my liking. Meanwhile, I found Ian Charleson more aloof than his character demanded. A larger problem that some questionable acting choices was the purpose of the movie. Other than the obvious statement against racism and ethnocentricism rife throughout the film, I don't know what I am supposed to have learned or gotten out of the film. Perhaps 'racism is bad' was the only purpose, which remains an important message, but I believe there was more attempting to be communicated. It could have been that the message was over my head, however, regardless, it didn't strike me. I concede that another viewing will almost always help in situations like these, but herein lies the movie buff problem; if I didn't like it the first time, will I ever watch it again?",6,2,4,4 March 2016
Rocky," 1976's Spoil
","File this one under the 'I finally get what everyone is talking about' section of movies I have waited too long to see. Now I understand why people scream 'yo, Adrian', or why my friends burst into a run up the stairs at the Lincoln Memorial on our class trip to D.C. It took Oscar month for me to see the 1976 Best Picture Winner, starring Sylvester Stallone, directed by John G. Avildsen. I had some preconceived biases about this film. I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, a film also nominated for the Academy's top prize in 1976. I am also a fan of another film that was up for the top prize that year, Network. Since I enjoy these other films so much, I have shunned Rocky throughout the years believing my favorite (Taxi Driver) to have been brutally snubbed. Regardless of my feelings, it was time to see Rocky, and I'm glad I did.Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a simpleton, working for a loan shark and boxing part-time with a local gym. He is enamored with Adrian (Talia Shire), the equally simple-minded sister of Paulie (Burt Young), a friend of Rocky's from his neighborhood. As much as he wants to be, Rocky is not proving himself as a fighter. He is losing matches and performing so poorly that he has gotten the locker he has occupied for 6 years taken away by gym owner, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). With a brilliant stroke of luck, heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) visits Rocky's home state of Philadelphia. While he is there, his manager's set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, promoting the event as a way for 'a nobody to become a somebody'. They choose the most desperate opponent for Creed when they select Rocky. Dejected and seeing this fight as his one big chance to finally achieve his dream as a prize fighter, Rocky gets a manager in Mickey and starts intensive training in hopes of achieving a huge upset over Creed.Rocky told a great story and was filmed in such a perfectly gritty way that related well to the titular character's plight. I wish there could have been a little more character development of the boxer, but based on the ending of this film, it seemed as though the director/producers already knew there was to be a sequel in the works. Perhaps Rocky II sheds a little more light on the intricacies of the boxer; I'll have to check that out. Chemistry was exactly what it should have been. Rocky kept an emotional distance from everyone, therefore, everyone maintained emotional distance from Rocky. The acting was true to character and believable. I can't say enough good things about the cinematography of this film. I truly miss the days where every movie was shot on film; I'm definitely not a fan of digital.I am happy to have seen Rocky. It is a cultural phenomenon, with another movie in the series being released just last year. Rocky also proved to be a very well-done film, regardless of my reservations over Sylvester Stallone's acting. As good as Rocky was, I have not wavered from my personal assessment that Taxi Driver should have bagged Scorsese his first statuette. Taxi Driver was a better, more developed film, but for a different audience. But hey, now I can say 'yo Adrian' along with the masses now.",7,1,2,11 February 2016
Don't Breathe," Don't Breathe
","I had been anticipating the 2016 feature written and directed by Fede Alvarez for months. Being a big fan of the horror movie genre, I always make new horror movies a must-see theatre event. Starring Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto as three thieving teenagers who set their sights on robbing a blind man in a secluded neighborhood who supposedly sits on a massive sum from a settlement. Desperation leads people to some sinister places, and the desperation of each character was explored in Alvarez's Don't Breathe.Three teenagers in depression sacked Michigan have turned to robbery as a means of survival. For Rocky (Jane Levy) there is another agenda to her criminal deeds. She has clearly lived a rough life with her addiction ridden abusive mother and can't stand to see her sister live the same life she lived, Rocky just wants to steal enough to be able to afford to take them away and start a new life. Alex (Dylan Minnette) is the brains of the operation; his father's work as a security guard affords him access to the master keys that disarm those homes and grant the teens access to steal. Money (Daniel Zovatto) is the muscle, finding out what homes to rob and selling the goods they steal for cash after each break-in. When Money hears that there is a man in a secluded, run-down neighborhood sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars he won in a settlement with a wealthy family whose young daughter killed his own daughter after striking her with a vehicle, the take is too good to refuse. Once they find out the man is blind, however, Alex has a change of heart and a resurgence of morals at the prospect of stealing from a handicapped person. Money and Rocky conversely start to think that the robbery will be all the easier and are invigorated thinking about the riches they are sure to achieve. Once they gain entry, however, things take a turn for the worse quickly, and the teens realize they are vastly in over their head and will be lucky to get out with their lives, let alone the money. Don't Breathe isn't without its good moments, unfortunately, those are just moments. Daniel Zovatto really chews the scenery, and his over-exaggerated facial expressions are extremely distracting. The score is one of pure laziness. I subscribe to the notion that a horror movie is dependent upon its score. What is a good horror movie without a blood pressure raising tone to it; certainly Jaws nor Halloween would be as revered to the genre if it weren't for their classic fear-inducing music. Don't Breathe just doesn't have it, I'm not sure what the composer was going for but it didn't work. All the elements were there but it didn't amount in the end. The third act was a sharp departure from the first two and was a complete mess that didn't fit in with the preceding elements in the least. What Don't Breathe did do well was create the downtrodden, desperate atmosphere that the American town hit hardest by the economic depression of 2008 has had to deal with ever since. The audience can really appreciate the lowly state of all the kids involved that has brought them to stealing as a means of survival. I was hoping for so much more from Don't Breathe, but it falls flat, like most modern-day horror movies leaving one to wonder, is there any hope for the genre in a post-slasher film horror world?",4,3,10,29 August 2016
Titanic," Titanic
","Rounding out a three-way tie for most Academy Award wins, James Cameron's 1997 Best Picture-winning film Titanic, was as massive in scope as the doomed titular White Star liner. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet join together to tell the story of the most well-known nautical disaster of the 20th century. Cameron takes some liberties with the telling of the disaster, largely through the injected romance between a young aristocrat and a struggling artist. The story is told in sweeping Cameron fashion, that he is well known for, through a beautiful juxtaposition of tragedy and doomed courtship. Boarding the luxurious R.M.S. Titanic with her family and fiancé, Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) feels like she is in shackles boarding a slave boat. The beautiful young woman of 17 is being married off to a man that views her as property and a reflection of himself rather than a person to build a life with. Once the ship docks in Philadelphia, Rose is to marry Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), a wealthy oil businessman in a union arranged by her mother Ruth Dewitt Bukater (Frances Fisher). Rose has no attraction or interest in building a life together with Cal, and their marriage is seen as a way out of the financial difficulty the death of Rose's father has brought to their family. While pondering her future plight along the ship deck, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor vagabond who won his ticket on the liner in a poker game locks eyes with her. Instantly smitten, Jack's new role is to break social barriers and explore a romance with Rose. Jack finally gets his chance when he talks Rose off the ledge of the ship one night when she is consumed by despair over her upcoming nuptials and sees suicide as the only way out. Being invited to dinner with Cal and Rose's family as a gesture of thanks for his being at the right place at the right time, Jack borrows a suit and charms Rose. Knowing how she feels about her life and fiancé, Jack stops at nothing to convince Rose that they can endure a relationship with each other filled with love and the mutual freedom Rose so desires. The story of the doomed love is told through 101-year old Rose after her necklace has been found aboard the sunken wreckage by a team of excavators led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton).Taken at what it is, Titanic is a wonderful film. Cameron beautifully juxtaposes the romance along with the historically accurate depiction of the ship's voyage. The film is heavy on romance, however, and if that's not your preferred genre you will struggle to look past it and focus on the history alone. The film looks as beautiful as it sounds, which is no easy feat given the subject manner. The elegant music accompanies the riches that shine through the set and cinematography in a perfect union. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful in the film and walks the line between boyhood charm and adult charisma that can be counted on quite well. As good as Winslet was in the role, she seemed miscast for the part. Her mature beauty was difficult to accept as a 17-year-old young woman. The chemistry between the two actors, however, was magical, and may be the reason to overlook Winslet not being believable as a teenager. Class and social standings are mainstays of exploration throughout the film. Rose loves art, and Jack is an artist in the time where even Pablo Picasso's works are looked upon as infantile, with Cal proclaiming that he 'will never amount to a somebody'. In a world that only accepts one way to live and one idea to live up to, Jack and Rose can't find a place to fit in, which is only made better by them finding each other; and really, who can't relate to the feeling of being an outsider in the world in which they live?",8,2,4,28 April 2016
Psycho," Psycho
","Alfred Hitchcock directed probably his best-known work in 1960 with his feature based on the book of the same name by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and Hitchcock's abandoned would-be star Vera Miles; Psycho explores a desperate woman's attempt to forge a life with her boyfriend, and a man driven by his relationship to his mother. Psycho is a wonderful case study into the psyche of human beings with vastly different outlooks and intentions for their lives. Hitchcock delved into the psychology of humanity in a way to make audiences pay attention all the while creating a complete masterpiece and the film most closely associated with the famed suspense director.On a December day in Arizona, the audience meets Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who has just spent an extended lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is divorced and lives far from Marion so the only time they have together is stolen lunch hours and hotel rooms. Sam is reluctant to further his relationship with Marion, despite the intense love shared between the two, because he pays a monthly alimony to his divorcÃ©e wife. Marion has a deep conversation with Sam in regards to the future of their relationship, as she wishes to become a married woman and create a home for Sam. Leaving the hotel room feeling helpless, a little desperate, and enslaved by her love of Sam so much so that she knows herself to be unable to leave him. Upon returning to her office, Marion's boss brings in a client flashing around $40,000 in cash for a transaction. Marion, being the one trusted to take the large sum of cash to the bank, instantly devises a plot in which she and Sam can enjoy a life together, married, together, and happy, if she can get away with the $40,000. Instead of going to the bank, Marion scurries home to pack a bag and embark on a new life. After speeding away on her new mission, Marion's boss passes her on the street initiating a guilt trip that Marion can't escape. After taking a nap on the side of the road, Marion has an interaction with a police officer which puts her even more on edge. Marion, convinced she must trade in her car for a new one after seeing her boss on the street, hastily makes a deal with the dealership o\owner and speeds away hoping to avoid suspicion. After an especially rainy night, Marion has become unsure of her location and pulls into a secluded motel. Emerging from her car for shelter for the night, Marion meets motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly nice young man who helps Marion inside with her bags and offers to make her dinner so she doesn't have to go back out into the rain. After hearing a heated exchange between Norman and his mother, Marion offers advice and consolation for Norman, believing his mother to be an overbearing negative presence on his life. Norman is clearly taken aback by what he perceives to be an attack against his mother, Marion is taken aback by his strong reaction and seeks refuge to her room as she has already begun questioning her plan and seems to have decided to go back to Tuscon, return the money, and make amends with her boss. Little does Marion know, Norman and his relationship to his mother would interfere with her plans.Psycho has reached the point that there is little left to say about this film. It's a near perfect entry on Hitchcock's filmography. Psycho is so closely associated with the famed director that it has been endlessly analyzed and heralded for the masterwork that it is. The standout from the film, other than the brilliant direction of a largely dialogue-driven plot, is the fantastic score. Bernard Herrmann, a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, crafts a perfect horror/suspense score that is as iconically connected to the film as the John Williams score is to Jaws. Granted, I haven't seen much of Anthony Perkins' work, but he was perfectly cast in the role of Norman Bates. Norman had to embody a psychotic crazed maniac inside a quiet, unassuming petulant child all at once, and Perkins was perfect for the extreme marriage of characterization. Martin Balsam is a brilliant character actor and it's always fun to see him pop up in a film. As earlier stated, Psycho is a surprisingly dialogue- driven film, with only a few shots of action sparsed throughout the film. The pivotal scene in which Marion and Norman share dinner together, bringing Marion back to her good- natured self, was filmed in such a perfect way highlighting the taxidermied shells on the wall exposing the possibility that Norman could be a much more sinister character than he initially appears. Hitchcock proves his strength as a suspense director with his seminal classic, Psycho. Near-perfect direction, incredible casting, and a brilliant score, it is clear to see why Psycho has stood the test of time, and remains a favorite and yearly Halloween viewing tradition, for myself anyway.",9,1,2,7 November 2016
Rosemary's Baby," 'It's alive, it's moving'
","Is it too soon to sing Roman Polanski's praises as a director? His 1968 feature, his first American production, Rosemary's Baby cements him at the forefront of true auteurs. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes join with their odd chemistry to expose the deterioration of a couple who moves into a Gothic style apartment in New York City with an unsavory history. Utilizing exceptional spatial relationships, Polanski weaves a near-perfect psychological horror movie for the ages.Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) are a young couple ready to make a home and start a family. Once they view a Gothic style apartment in Manhatten, they fall in love with the property and move in, in spite of the warnings against moving in from their current landlord who warns them of the scary history of the building's past. Immediately after moving in, an older nosy couple that lives in the building, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) and (Ruth Gordon) befriend the young couple. At first, the couple laughs off their quirky behavior until Guy becomes fascinated by Roman's stories and begins spending a great deal of time at their apartment. Rosemary remains skeptical about their idiosyncrasies but becomes distracted when she finally becomes pregnant after a strange dream she has. The further along in her pregnancy Rosemary gets, the more strained and distant her relationship with her husband becomes. When Roman and Minnie take an obsessive interest in her pregnancy and child, Rosemary becomes convinced that the couple and their friends have demonic interests in her baby.The directing prowess of Roman Polanski in this faithful adaptation of the book by Ira Levin of the same name is one that will impact the audience and stay with you long after the film concludes. He absolutely nails the overwhelmingly claustrophobic mood of the film by confining most of the film to being shot in the young couple's apartment. Confining the shots to just the couple's apartment was even more pronounced as Polanski placed the actors in such close proximity to each other that they bumped into each other as they were roaming around the new home. He also compiled among the film several well-executed long shots further exposing the deliberate movements and the close proximity of the actors. I just can't get over how well Polanski filmed Rosemary's Baby, I thought I had seen it all when I saw his Chinatown, but Rosemary's Baby was far superior, and to think it was his first American film. Some directors just have 'it'.The whole time Rosemary was preparing to be a mother, she was being manipulated by other people. She was doing her absolute best to protect her child, even though it meant putting herself at risk. Rosemary had wanted to become a mother since she and Guy's marriage and was overwhelmed with happiness to finally get the chance. As her pregnancy progressed, Rosemary realized something was vastly different with her Dr., recommended to her by the Castevets. She was gravely ill throughout most of her pregnancy even though she was taking the special drink prepared daily by Minnie. Once she was finally convinced that a demonic episode was taking place with her baby as the pawn, Rosemary did her best to escape, but all her efforts were thwarted by her husband and the Castevets. At the film's conclusion, Rosemary knows what has happened to her child and must make the ultimate decision on whether to parent the child she always wanted or abandon what had become of him.",9,0,1,30 May 2016
When Harry Met Sally...," When Harry Met Sally
","When Harry Met Sally is one of those films that I was in no way prepared for, which is my favorite kind of new favorite film to watch. Having never seen a Rob Reiner film, I wasn't sure of his style or technique or how he approached his subjects. I quickly learned through his 1989 feature that he provides a very real look at the lives of people in relationships. When Harry Met Sally tells the tale of a chance meeting between two strangers who then continue to reappear in each other's lives. The way in which Reiner exposes the truths of finding someone you can best tolerate in a partner, rather than the person that makes your heart turn to mush is a brilliant grasp of how to illustrate the human condition. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan star in the titular roles and provide the brilliant illustration of everyday, flawed human beings often sensationalized for cinema.Sally (Meg Ryan) agrees to give her friend's boyfriend, Harry (Billy Crystal) a ride to New York upon their graduation from the University of Chicago. After a long car ride of sharing all the quirky details that make up their existence, completely uninhibited since they are unavailable to each other. After the journey to New York is complete, the two part ways not thinking much of each other. Harry and Sally keep bumping into each other over the years as their lives intersect. They finally decide to maintain a friendship, and quickly become friends and confidants. As they see each other through each successive stage of their lives, it becomes increasingly more difficult to watch the other date. Neither of the two has ever shared such intimate details of their lives, their hopes, fears, and dreams with another person so it only makes sense that the two fall in love. Two people with such neuroses in some ways make a perfect match, but in other ways are their own biggest obstacles in love.A film that looks and feels this much like Annie Hall is obviously going to rank highly on my list. I had begun writing about the similarities this film shared with Annie Hall, but I soon gave up because there are just too many. The dialogue is fantastic and the entire film is so well-written. Even though the famous line 'I'll have what she's having.' has worked its way into the American lexicon, it loses nothing when it is spoken. Oftentimes, with a line so popular, the audience member has the 'roll-your-eyes-'oh' moment when it's spoken; but that's not the case with When Harry Met Sally because the script is so perfect. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were perfect in their roles, with just enough chemistry to make their unconventional friendship work. Despite how great Meg Ryan was in the role, and also despite the fact that the fate of the universe wouldn't allow it, I couldn't help but think all throughout the film how perfect Gilda Radner (R.I.P.) would have been in the role opposite Crystal. Anyway, When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant look at the lives of real people, and an exceptional film that has already become a new favorite.",10,6,8,9 April 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," Oscar's Top Prize 1930
","I kicked off my February, which is always Oscar's month, with All Quiet on the Western Front. Director Lewis Milestone's wartime drama took home the Academy's top prize for 1930. Capturing the essence of the individuals directly involved in the conflict, All Quiet on the Western Front, is a magnificent look at the effects of war both on soldiers physicality and mentality. A poignant look at a time when many fighting were just young boys trying to be heroes, All Quiet on the Western Front seems worthy of the gold statuette.Opening inside a classroom, a professor is convincing a classroom of impressionable teenagers to enlist, revealing the first unfortunate aspect of WWI. In the cloak of patriotism, a group of young men vow to support their country in war. Many of them end up permanently injured, some losing limbs, all of them end up emotionally scarred. The incredible part of this is that it was 1930. Seeing such a raw portrayal was incredible. The shots of each young man's face were well-done and beautifully executed each time. A well-done film, All Quiet on the Western Front is definitely one to see.",7,5,5,2 February 2016
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years a SLave
","Steve McQueen's 2012 Best Picture winner, 12 Years a Slave provides an unflinching gaze into being black in the pre-Civil War United States. A film that touches so many levels of our nation's history, politics, economics, and morality; the film exists as a cornerstone for attempting to understand the struggle. One can never study too much, or gain too much of an understanding of something that shaped a nation and still contributes to today's understandings of individuals. If this year's presidential election is any indication, we need to be weary of the dark spots of our history so we avoid repeating them. 12 Years is a good place to start to gain a sense of that understanding.Chiwetel Ejiofor's Solomon Northup was an African American man living in upstate New York, where his relations with others were far from perfect, but he enjoyed his freedom. He was a free man in the time of slavery, working as a violinist. Solomon has a wife and two children and, considering their unfortunate place in history, live a good life. That good life is destroyed the day Solomon is abducted and sold into slavery. Initially vehement about his status as a free man to anyone he comes into contact with, Soloman eventually decides that cooperation is paramount to his survival. Sold as property to several landowners, Solomon is subjected to cruel working conditions including backbreaking labor under the harsh sun, whippings, and other forms of abuse. He is also demoralized by being forced to take communal showers and endless verbal abuse; all with the expectation of being responded with obedience. Twelve years pass with Solomon enduring these conditions, all the while his spirit and heartbroken over the family he left behind.Powerful doesn't even begin to describe this film. The lengths McQueen went to ensure realism translated through the film. Much of this film's success is owed to a wonderful sound design team. The sounds the whips made as they struck flesh, namely in the scene in which Solomon is forced to beat fellow slave Patsey, (Lupita Nyong'o). The scene itself is gut-wrenching; Solomon's life was threatened if he refused to beat Patsey, or if he beat her too softly, leaving the slave-owner to enjoy a sadistic laugh with each strike to Patsey. Each release of the whip gave audience members a sting to the back it was so real. The acting was impeccable, with Ejiofor and Nyong'o both taking home Oscar's gold statuette for their performances. The aspect that made the film perhaps was the incredible direction by Steve McQueen. McQueen's ability to tell the story of the real-life Solomon Northup with such stark realism yet careful clarity proves him deserving of the Best Director Oscar he earned for this film. 12 Years a Slave was Academy's big winner for 2012, after seeing the film, it's no wonder why.",7,0,3,7 March 2016
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'The only important thing is how to live like a human being.'
","Few movies tell the story of war in such an unbiased way, only to show its dehumanizing effects. About midway through Bridge on the River Kwai, the viewer no longer is too interested in who will 'win' the conflict (how do you do that anyway?—But that's for another conversation), but rather about the lengths these men have gone away from their beings. We see people who were driven to the brink of what one can survive, and not all of them did. A true test of the boundaries of the human spirit, Bridge on the River Kwai, directed by David Lean, took home Oscar's top prize in 1957.Brash, yet civil Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) commander of a group of British soldiers captured as POW's by the Japanese military in the midst of WWII has a single vision in mind. Armed with the promise of the Geneva Convention, Nicolson is determined to lead his men with honor. Determined to conduct himself and his men with the honor betrothed to those that don the British uniform, Nicolson endures more than anyone thought he could survive to gain the respect of his captors. The Japanese eventually realize that Nicholson is a force to be reckoned with, and as much as they may wish to kill him, their hands are figuratively tied. Gaining respect, Nicholson eventually becomes an integral part of the Japanese plan to build a bridge over the river Kwai veiled as a useful wartime measure that actually only serves as a monument to Japanese commanding officer Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Although his men don't want to do the work that glorifies the Japanese, Nicholson ensures them that completion of the bridge will actually serve as a testament to the will and honorability of the British. Construction goes on, with the help of the British, all the while allies have hatched a plan to burn the bridge down, led by escaped American prisoner Shears (William Holden). The two plots work together to form one cohesive story of men afflicted with battle and the concessions that some won't even allow themselves to make in a time of war.This film shows Alec Guinness at his best, a raw look at a man in the heart of battle that refuses to leave his morals behind. He excels as a man leading his men with the dignity each deserves as a human being. William Holden is also a standout in this picture. Holden plays the role of the disillusioned prisoner who has given up hope with ease, coming off both believable and lovable. The cinematography of this film was a thing of beauty. In scenes with hundreds of men marching, the audience is graced with seeing the vast landscape that is so grand it appears to completely encompass the men. There were also incredible shots through binoculars that show, in part, the directorial genius of David Lean. The acting and technical elements came together to create a strong film that explores the depth of the human spirit.It is sometimes difficult to watch a movie with no clear hero. Everyone comes off a little crazy in this film; which perhaps, may explain why the final lines in this film were 'the madness, the madness'. I don't want a cookie-cutter movie by any means, but I also don't want to travel half way through an almost three-hour film rooting for someone, only to realize he's a bit off his rocker. I suppose, however, that is what happens when you have a movie like Bridge on the River Kwai, with such heavy themes as honor, strength, and valor. Technically, I understand why this film took home Oscar's top prize; the acting and writing allows one to understand this as well. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war films, of course, even though this one is quite different from the standard. Also, I would recommend Bridge on the River Kwai to anyone who needs reassurance that the human spirit can overcome even the darkest of evils.",8,2,3,3 February 2016
Whiplash," 'There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job' '
","Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller) is a teenager, newly enrolled at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music--the school with the best music program in the United States, hopelessly obsessed with his compulsion to become one of the greatest drummers to ever live. He is the black sheep in many aspects of his life; his family is not musically inclined, he struggles in social situations and has no desire to forge friendships. Andrew is a loner, driven only by his musical passions. One of the most noted bands at the Shaffer Conservatory is Terence Fletcher's (J.K. Simmons) jazz studio band. Fletcher's band is as well-known for its penchant for winning band competitions, as it is for it's militant and abrasive conductor. Students vie for a seat in Fletcher's band due to their consistently high competition standings, but Fletcher's brand of leadership is not one that all students can endure. Fletcher pushes people to their very limits with his verbal abuse knowing exactly what punches to throw based on the individual. Despite his constant abuses, Andrew wants nothing more than to gain Fletcher's respect and accolades. Being brought into the band as an alternate drummer, Andrew will stop at nothing to prove himself to his disparaging instructor. Eventually sacrificing everything in his life, including his coveted relationship with his single-parent father and his health, Andrew must decide what he is trying to do in his life and how Fletcher and his expectations correspond with Andrew's desires. Director Damien Chazelle makes some brilliant decisions for his 2014 film. Among the decisions that make Whiplash a cut above the rest are the quick cuts he uses throughout. By choosing to use such rapid- fire cuts throughout the film, Chazelle makes the audience a part of the world of playing music, especially helpful for novices of the craft. Another outstanding choice by Chazelle was the low-key lighting used throughout the film. The lighting which almost makes the film look yellow or orange sets a unique tone to the film, illustrating the notion that being a part of Fletcher's band is like being in a whole new world. Chazelle also focuses his lighting mostly on the band, with special emphasis on the drums, initially casting Andrew outside of the lighting, eventually engulfing him the more he becomes engulfed with the version of success Fletcher identifies with.J.K. Simmons nearly convinces me in this role that no actor has ever been more deserving of the Best Actor Oscar than he was in this film, he is that good in it. Simmons character, who initially comes off as a one-dimensional drill sergeant like band teacher, is revealed to have a depth that not all actors could have pulled off. Simmons had the task of creating a character that was uniquely inspiring, yet unnervingly debilitating. Fletcher seemed to truly believe that he was on a mission to sift through every practice room where a truly great performer may go unnoticed and hone their talents before gifting them to the public. It seems Fletcher uses his rigid hateful demeanor to weed out those that do not possess the skill and drive that it takes to become 'one of the greats'. The much talked about ending pits the master against the student in a duel to prove who has the stamina to withstand the other, and whether or not the talent was present all along or not. Was Fletcher trying to ruin Andrew--it seems so, but when Andrew refuses to be thrown to the side like a set list after a concert, Fletcher's motivation seems to change right before the audience's eyes. After his initial plan fails, Fletcher seems to push Andrew, in a positive way, through the difficult music and seems to want to see Andrew succeed. Even that shift in attitude leaves the audience wondering just what Fletcher's motivation is. Is Fletcher simply attempting to pad his resume by finding great musicians he can groom for success, or does he just love music so much that he wants it to be enriched with the best talents available in the world at the time, the audience never knows, and Fletcher may not either. This complicated motivation and multi-layered characterization serve as a testament to what Simmons did with the part, and how well he pulled it off. There is a brilliant scene during the ultimate on- stage battle at the end of the film between in which Andrew's father Jim (Paul Reiser), who was in the audience for Andrew's show, is seen looking through a doorway at his son on stage. There is a fleeting, brilliantly captured look on Jim's face that show simultaneously, that he no longer knows who his son is, and his worry that he may have been replaced in his son's eyes. Andrew has completely changed who he is, in order to fit into Fletcher's band, and the skilled way in which he is playing on-stage prove that he has greatly developed as a musician. Drumming can no longer be brushed off as a lighthearted hobby discussed only during Thanksgiving dinner anymore, and he may actually be 'one of the greats' like he always wished to become. Jim also seems to see that Andrew has been far more influenced by his instructor than his father. Andrew has been strongly motivated by another man, possibly diminishing the role his father will play in Andrew's life. A stunning visual spectacle, a wonderful score, and superb acting from J.K. Simmons make Whiplash a film to be remembered for years to come.",10,1,2,16 November 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Caesar!
","Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) works for the fictitious studio hybrid Capitol Pictures, (that is the only fictitious angle about this film, however). Mannix is a fixer, the one responsible for repairing the issues of his acting stars, keeping the religious leaders happy with the morals of the films of his studio's, and securing the money stays in the right places for film production. Mannix leads a busy life, but he is sure to make time for his daily stop to his Catholic Church's confessional. Despite the Priest's urging that his practice is excessive, Mannix still shows up, desperate to make amends for his transgressions, also to work through his own issues with his faith. During a typical day of dealing with pregnant single movie stars, placating religious leaders, and casting dilemmas, Mannix is dealt an extreme blow that his biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped. Those responsible for the stars kidnapping, who refer to themselves as 'The Future' promise the safe return of the studio's star in exchange for $100,000. Not only does Mannix have to scrounge up the funds to pay off the ransom, but he has to do it while keeping the situation out of the gossip columns running Hollywood public opinion. All of Mannix's problems may be solved, however, if he accepts a surprise offer in management at the Lockheed Corporation overseeing secret atomic bomb testing. Does Mannix really want to leave behind his chaotic role at the studio, or is such the profession exactly what he needs for the self-discovery he so seeks.The first and most obvious point to be made about the film is that it looks incredible. The use of color and the cinematography are works of art, leaping off the screen. It is no wonder the film was nominated for Best Production design, as the many large and elaborate sets were astonishing. Filming several movie sets is no small task. but the team behind Hail, Caesar! really pulled it off. Near the opening of the film, Brolin's character is discussing the depiction of Jesus in one of the studio's upcoming films with Priests, a Rabbi, and an Imam Khatib (maybe); this scene could come directly out of a joke, but it is complete perfection and timely in the film. It was a brilliant scene exposing, without a doubt, the faith-based journey the audience was about to take. What was an especially fun aspect of the film were the obvious caricatures of actors, directors, and producers from the studio era. As a fan of classic film, seeing such personalities as Ernst Lubitsch exaggerated on-screen was a true delight. There were also several notable supporting stars in the film it was a joy to see who would turn up next. Ever since I first saw Patrick Fischler in Mulholland Dr. I've wanted to see him in everything and was overjoyed that he briefly showed up in Hail, Caesar!. Typical of the Coen Brother's films, there was some brilliant camera angles to enjoy including wonderful low-angle, birds-eye-view shots and perfect shadow manipulation creating a beautiful film to look at. One of my favorite aspects of Hail, Caesar! was the frequency with which the audience gets to see the film from a perspective usually ignored. The camera is typically trained on the star of the film, but seeing the POV of an extra looking up at Baird Whitlock and all of his imperfections was a nice change. Whether it be a picture, a film, or anything else, I am always interested in what's going on in the background; what is it that is not being shown for a litany of reasons, and with Hail, Caesar! It is that background activity that gets such high regard, a refreshing angle for a film.My favorite aspect of a Coen brothers film is the subtext. Even if I am not always a fan of the duo's work, the fact that each of their films are riddled with subtext create, at least, an engaging film-watching experience. The takeaway from Hail, Caesar!, for me anyway is its subtext on faith and religion. It's clear that the character embodied by Josh Brolin is grappling with his faith throughout the film. He takes time out of his schedule daily to go to confession, he deals with the religious depiction in his studio's films seriously and even has a God-like job himself. Brolin's Mannix is responsible for removing problems and making sure everyone's life is as painless as possible all the while controlling the flow of money and output of his studio. People turn to him when experiencing problems, much like they turn to Christ to help cope. In the end, Mannix is offered a job to help protect the lives of the whole world, furthering his relation to an omnipresent being. Evaluating faith and religion in such a way was a serious strength to Hail, Caesar!. A deeper evaluation of faith and religion should be explored through cinema, as it is the medium with which art is nearly limitless. The Coen brothers, never to shy away from depth in their films, strike gold again with a thorough analysis of faith, and what it means to adhere to a religion. If you examine Hail, Caesar! on its own, rather than an entry in the filmography of the Coen brothers, a deeper appreciation may be able to be experienced for a wonderful film with a rich, much-needed subtext.",10,0,3,27 February 2017
Jaws," 'How come the sun didn't use to shine in here.'
","About four minutes into Jaws and one can quickly understand why it was the first summer blockbuster. Directed by Steven Spielberg in 1975, Jaws sets the tone of anticipatory horror that it maintains throughout the whole film immediately from the opening shots. Starring Roy Scheider; in a brilliantly subtle commanding performance, along with Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, Jaws tells the tale of a quiet beach town that gets the shock of their lives when they discover their calm waters have been overtaken by a man- eating shark intent to kill. The second entry on AFI's 100 Years 100 Thrills list, it is no wonder audiences around the globe still site Jaws as the reason they are reluctant to enter the water at the beach.Amity Island's brand new Sheriff, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is trepidatious of the water anyway and seems like he'd be happier to return to his family's home in New York. Shortly after his arrival, there is evidence of a shark attack, as a girl turns up dead on the shore after a night of partying. For a town that solely depends on the revenue from its beaches for survival, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) scoffs at the initial recommendation from Sheriff Brody to close the beach. Unable to surmount the incredible resistance, Brody relinquishes his better judgment in favor of keeping the beaches open, as few people knew about the incident with the girl anyway. To Brody's regret, a boy is attacked and killed by a shark the next weekend. The boy's mother causes an influx of fisherman flooding Amity Island after she offers a $3000 reward for the capture and killing of the shark that killed her son. Among those that flood the Island are Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), from the Oceanographic Institute who specializes in hunting Great White sharks. Still reluctant to close the beach, Mayor Vaughn instructs Brody to assemble a team and go to any means necessary to make the beach safe. A local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) agrees to hunt the shark, vowing to be able to kill it and bring peace to Amity Island. The three men, arm themselves into a boat that they soon realize is too small, and immerse themselves into the habitat of the creature. Steven Spielberg is at his best in this film. No stone is left unturned in the creation of the world of Amity Island. Each aspect of filmmaking, among them: the camera work, the writing, and the acting are nothing short of fantastic. Most of the success of this film must be paid to the famously haunting score composed by John Williams. As good as the story and as visually striking as Jaws was, had it not been for Williams' score, I doubt that people would be talking about it as much as they still do, 40 years after its release. Character development is phenomenal in Jaws, as well. Each main character has a completely fleshed out (see what I did there) story which is often lacking in films. Spielberg's camera work in this film, especially his exquisite use of foreground, middle ground, and background illustrates why he has the status as a director that he does. Filled with incredible shots, such as the scene in which the audience sees Brody typing 'shark attack' on the death report of the first victim are a tribute to Spielberg's prowess in the director's chair. With a cast of likable characters, an infectiously adventurous plot, and a thrilling unpredictable protagonist, it is easy to see why Jaws still lives in the recesses of our minds 40 years after its release. Still noted for being the first summer blockbuster, the reputation of Jaws has not been lost despite its 1975 release date. Surprisingly, notwithstanding the advancements in special effects since the mid- 70's; Jaws has not dated very much at all, still creating a scare for today's audiences. Jaws does the amazing feat, indicative of a highly skilled director, of scarcely showing the beast of the film, yet instilling fear in the audience. Thankfully, there is not much of summer left for me to ponder the chances of my being attacked by a shark; yeah, Jaws is that good, even in 2016.",10,2,4,10 August 2016
The Blind Side," The Blind Side
","Oftentimes, the opportunity to change someone's life completely is disguised as an isolated random act of kindness. John Lee Hancock's 2009 feature The Blind Side starring Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock in a career-defining role shows just how far a series of kind acts can go towards changing someone's life and giving them purpose. Seventeen-year-old Michael Oher could have been like the thousands of other disadvantaged persons of color ending up in gangs or victims of violence had it not been for the intervention of one family from Tennessee. In a world where everyone had given up on him, Michael Oher just needed one reason to shine, which he got, and it all started with a new shirt.One rainy night after a high school basketball game, Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is walking back to the gym, hoping to find some food left behind and a dry bleacher to sleep under. Also leaving the game are Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock), Sean (Tim McGraw), Collins (Lily Collins), and S.J. (Jae Head) Tuohy, an affluent family from Memphis. Seeing the cold, wet young man walking aimlessly in the rain, Leigh Anne instructs her husband to pull over and check on him. When Michael indicates that he is intending to sleep in the gymnasium Leigh Anne insists that he stay overnight with them, intending to figure out his situation in the morning. When the sun rises, it is revealed that Michael has no permanent address, and has gained entry to his exclusive high school through a favor of a friend. Leigh Anne then buys Michael some clothes and designates a room for him in her home, bringing him into their family. As their time together progresses, it is clear the impact the Tuohy family is having on Michael, but what is unexpected is the impact Michael is having on the Tuohy's. Michael is teaching the constantly busy philanthropist Tuohy family to come together more as a family and enjoy their time together, and more importantly, to rise above the societal expectations of their wealth and to always do the right thing. In the deep south, the presence of an African American teenager in a rich white family is heavily judged against and misunderstood by friends and family alike. Nothing will get in the way of Leigh Anne, however, and when Michael shows an interest in football, she stops at nothing to instruct the coach on how to motivate Michael on the playing field and goes the distance to help him qualify for play by improving his grades. When Michael proves to have a natural ability toward football, scouts instantly start noticing him and offering scholarships. After Michael plays for a Division 1 football team, he is selected in the NFL draft in 2009. None of the opportunities that befell upon Michael would have been possible without the Tuohy's, going to show just how much positive impact people can have on one another when they set their mind to it.The Blind Side wastes no time outlining its message, opening the film with video of the break heard 'round the world. The opening shot of the infamous tackle of Lawrence Taylor to Joe Theismann and the way it changed the game of football was a perfect opener to introduce the left tackle highlighted in the film. The film was also bookended well with mention of Lawrence Taylor at the end of the film as well, wrapping together the vehicle that paved the way for Michael Oher's brand of football. Sandra Bullock looks as good as I have ever seen her on-screen, completely capturing the heart and attitude of the real Leigh Anne Tuohy, more than earning her well- deserved Oscar. This film teetered the line between serious and fun in an exquisite way, never disrespecting the real family, and never being too much of a tear-jerker in the wrong places. One of the best examples of this tight-rope walk is the cameos of all the famous college football coaches that made their way into the film. The coaches were a great way to conceptualize the process and a great deal of fun for college football fans in the audience. Kathy Bates as the democrat tutor, the first democrat the Tuohy's ever knew personally to be exact, was a fun addition to the film. It was also nice to see the real Tuohy family pictures as the credits rolled on. The story of the courageous kindness of the Tuohy family is an exemplary example to all of us and a well-needed dose of goodness for the world to see. Sandra Bullock's portrayal as a protective, independent, take no nonsense mother was the shining part of The Blind Side. Her brand of ruthless kindness and an unwavering moral compass was a refreshing change on the common female character that blends into the background. There is no blending with Bullock's portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy, she is clearly in charge of her family and seeks to raise upstanding human beings, whether they are related or not. Her bringing in of Michael Oher into the family was a wonderful mutually beneficial gesture, and one that sticks with the audience to emulate in whatever way is feasible for them.",7,0,0,31 May 2016
The Big Short," The Big Short, comes up short
","The Big Short tells the tale of the only people who saw the financial disaster of 2008 coming, fringe Wall Street-ers and bankers who were just outside the fray enough to truly see what was going on. We learn about the disaster that took place within the housing market through four parallel story lines, all of which taking place in 2005. The first involves Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an eccentric former physician who has gained almost complete autonomy in his work due to his incredible financial savviness. He explains to his investors that the housing market has been propped up upon an unsustainable bubble and is on the brink of bursting within a couple years. He wants the support of his investors in his aim to bet against the housing market, because he is so sure the bubble is to burst. Burry fights an uphill battle, as nothing was seen more stable than the housing market before the crash, as it had never in history sustained an economic blow. The bank is fully willing to take Burry's money as he proceeds to bet against the housing market, completely confident they are in for a big pay day. We also meet Mark Baum (Steve Carell), the finance worker completely fed up with the fraud and greed of corporations and Wall Street. Baum is outspoken and unapologetic; a crusader who realizes the depth of corporate corruption, but it still surprised and sickened by its gravity. 'these are real people, people who will lose their homes and their jobs' Baum states disgustedly when he starts to see how deep the corruption has come in the housing market. Troubled by his own family tragedy, Baum fought against the banks, making the same sort of bets against them that Burry was making. Then there is Jared Vannett (Ryan Gosling), a Deutsche Bank trader who exudes over confidence, and embodies the personality of someone who is never told 'no'. His sole interest is to maximize capital for his investors, and sees his way of betting against the housing market as a sure payoff. Finally, there is Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), a retired super-investor who moved to Colorado and lives as off the grid as he can to escape the atrocities he was a part of in the financial sector. He acts as a mentor to two young men with a startup desperate to get more money, and a seat at Big Bank's table. A mix of motivations and interests guide the audience through the worst financial disaster of our lifetimes.Of all the things I thought could go wrong with The Big Short, pacing is not one I expected. I never thought getting the four story lines out there and fleshing out the difficult to understand bank lingo would be something told on-screen too slow, but it was. With so much to uncover and reveal about each individual, character development was only close to explored with Steve Carell's Mark Baum. The audience learns little about the other three story lines involved and is left with no real hero to side with. Granted, there is little to like, I suppose, about investors betting against the housing market and only getting their big pay day in the event of a global financial crash; further character development, however, would have went a long way in engaging the audience in the film. Unless of course you were engaged by the needless pop culture heavy devices to explain banking terms; i.e. a cameo by Selena Gomez, and Margot Robbie in a bubble bath. These injections of comedy and pop culture were immensely distracting and brought the viewer too far out of the world of the film. Overall, The Big Short was a disappointment considering the cast and storyline it had to work with. Questionable film styles also did little to endear this film to my heart.The cinematography was horrendous in this film. What I can only assume was an attempt at the look of a docu-drama; a hand-held camera was used for much of the shooting of this film. The problem with the docu- drama realism is that it didn't mesh with the big budget look of the film, and just turned out to be migraine inducing shakiness. Everything was too slow, and by the time it was finished we only got a short introduction to the main players within but outside of the game. The only bright spot to this film was the acting, with one big exception; Christian Bale. Bale is the type of actor that only touches what turns to gold, and I understand he learned enough drums for his role in the film to fit his portrayal which shows his commitment as an actor. Bale nailed the zaniness of Dr. Burry, but forgot to expose the intelligence. A man that is supposed to come off as a socially awkward genius came off heavy on the socially awkward and light on the genius. Steve Carell played his tormented idealist fantastically, and it is truly a miss for the Academy that he wasn't recognized for this role.If only the director, Adam McKay had more trust in the intelligence of his audience. Trust that he didn't have to embed pop culture reference at every turn and use beautiful big name actresses to interrupt the story. Had this film been done with a more serious tone, I believe it would have been deserving of all the attention it garnered from the Academy. But alas, we are left with another film propelled by a big name cast that could have been greatif only.",6,2,5,19 January 2016
Platoon," Platoon
","As a pacifist, I don't find myself watching a war movie too often. That being said, I found Platoon, the 1986 Best Picture winner written and directed by Oliver Stone to be an engaging film. I do find myself a fan of Oliver Stone, so I'm sure that helped with my overall assessment of the film. Platoon tells the story of a college-aged man, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who volunteers for active service during the Vietnam conflict. Chris endures what most everyone who saw active duty during the conflict endured, the horrors of death and violence. In addition to the horrors of war, Chris also endured the moral conflict that was rife through Vietnam. He watched entire villages decimated because the men in his platoon thought it was funny. he witnessed one member of his platoon, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) stand up for the injustices they were witnessing, only to be murdered by another member of the platoon, Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). The conflict can't end soon enough for Chris after all that he has seen.Oliver Stone goes to great lengths in this film to show the horrors of war often ignored in American media; the mistreatment of people in the invaded country. It was an important light to shine on the reality of war. Stone himself, being a Vietnam veteran, focused carefully on this issue, showing war's horrors without assessing blame on the individuals performing the attacks. Stone isn't seeking to blame the soldiers themselves, but rather take a systemic look at the realities war brings. I will probably never watch Platoon again, but I am happy to have seen it at least once.",6,0,1,4 March 2016
Scream," Scream
","In what should have been the ultimate homage to the horror genre, Scream turned out to be a disjointed look at how horror movies are often perceived. Directed by horror master, Wes Craven, his 1996 film followed a high schooler as she copes with the brutal murder of her mother when it seems as though her killer has returned to terrorize her town. Starring such 90's stars as Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette, Scream towed the line between horror brilliance and comedy quite unevenly. It was this disjointed dance among genres that left me far less impressed with Scream than I intended to be, especially having been directed by the man who gave audiences my personal favorite horror franchise, A Nightmare on Elm Street.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) a high school senior grieving her mother's senseless murder is stunned when it seems that, just before the year anniversary of her mother's death, the killer is still terrorizing the town. Sidney's world is rocked to its core when the ones closest to her begin being slaughtered in the same senseless fashion as her mother was killed. When the murders keep happening, police begin to suspect that the wrong person may have been convicted of Sidney's mother's murder, and begin to suspect Sidney's father. Convinced that her father is not the murderer, Sidney along with the help of the lead officer on the case, Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) begin to comb over all the case details in the interest of protecting Sidney's father and finding who they believe to be the copycat murderer. Their task is made none the easier by the constant intervention of Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) a money-hungry television reporter who wrote a book about the murder of Sidney's mother, which did little to endear her to Sidney. The more murders that take place, the more the killer's motive looks to be nothing but a game. Initiating the killings with a phone call and a quiz to save their lives, police must learn the identity of the killer before their game runs out.I wasn't sure what took me so long to see Scream. I am a big fan of the horror genre and had heard that Scream turned the genre on its head and was a fun mystery slasher for horror fans. A couple of poor casting choices and genre jumping, however, ensured that Scream will be a movie I only view once. I have never liked Matthew Lillard in any film I've seen him in. It's a personal problem, I know, but with him having a prominent role in Scream, I could hardly avoid my distaste for him by engulfing into any other actors. Also, the casting of Henry Winkler, as the principal of the high school, in a caricature of his most famous role as Fonzie from the Happy Days was an interesting maneuver. In a way, I admire the choice, as it's not likely those in the audience see Winkler without thinking of his iconic role, but it also pulls you out of the movie a lot to see him doing such an exaggerated caricature unrelated to the film. The other nail in the coffin of Scream was the senseless jumping around between a serious mystery of discovering the identity of a brutal killer, and a cheap laugh grabbing comedy. There were no smooth transitions between the comedy and the drama leaving the film a disjointed mess. A severe disappointment, Scream is a one-time viewing for this reviewer.",3,2,3,17 October 2016
Back to the Future Part II," It Was Finally Our Year, a Cubs Anthem
","Chicago Cubs fans across the nation clutched their copies of Back to the Future Part II when it looked like our Cubbies might make the film's World Series prophecy come true last October. The vision the film predicted didn't happen, of course, and we are all still perpetually humming 'there's always next year'. It's hard to believe this Cubs fan neglected to see this movie last year as I kept hearing 'We're going to do it, it's in Back to the Future'. All Cubs fandom aside, this was a great film to see, and I'm glad I can finally add it to the list of classics that I have seen, even if I waited too long.Back to the Future Part II reunites our unstoppable team of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in a journey to save Marty and his now girlfriend/future wife Jennifer's (Elizabeth Shue) children. Doc crashes, literally, the reunion between the two teen lovers after Marty's first trip through time with harrowing news. Doc informs the lovebirds that they marry in the future, which thrills them, but then informs them that there is a serious problem with the lives of their future children, and Marty's help is needed to thwart their futures. Doc has painstakingly worked through each moment in Marty McFly Jr.'s life and realized the moment that he went off track, October 21st, 2015. All that he needs is for Marty to intervene, act as his son and confront the bully that pushes him into the less than desirable situation and his life will be fine. A simple enough proposal, which of course doesn't work out the way Doc had planned. Marty gets greedy and buys a sports almanac to take with him to the past with the idea that he will place bets on all the winners and become rich. Doc vehemently disregards this idea and puts Marty in his place, morally. Unfortunately for the world, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) finds the almanac, discovers the DeLorean doubling as a time machine, and travels back to 1955, where Marty just left and gives the book to a relative with a less prominent moral compass. Unbeknownst are Biff's travels to Doc and Marty who travel back to 1985 to find their home in a depressing state, and their own lives in complete disarray. To reverse the curse, Doc comes up with a plan to send he and Marty back to 1955 so Marty can take to book from Griff (Thomas F. Wilson), the complicated part of this plan is to not disrupt the initial journey Marty took to 1955. Since time is a continuum, Marty's first trip to 1955 is taking place just the same as it did before, so it becomes imperative for neither Marty nor Doc to see their past/future selves and prevent further disaster. Watching the duo glide through time on an ever evolving mission to save themselves and humanity was just as enjoyable to watch in this sequel as it was in the original film. One can't wait to see what happens next, as the end of the film guarantees we will see the team again.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd look just as comfortable and believable in this story as they did in the first. It was fun to see their chemistry and watch them think up their plots then set them in motion throughout the film. The adaptability of the two actors shows their versatility and comes off so naturally for the audience. There are, of course, supporting actors in this film, but most of the film takes place with just these two on screen so chemistry is crucial, and was achieved in this film to optimal level.The overarching moral lesson in Back to the Future Part II is pretty clear; don't cheat the world just to make a buck, or, millions upon millions of bucks in Marty's ideal situation. Doc was right to dissuade Marty from taking the sports almanac with him to 1985, even if some of us may have cheered Marty's idea. One should not take advantage of invention and use it for personal gain. This can be thought of more deeply in everyday life as well. This message definitely makes one think about their position in life and the potential of privilege associated with that position. Doc also reminds us in this film, as he did in the first film, that one should not know too much about their own future. He remains steadfast in the idea that we shouldn't be privy to what will happen in our own lives in the future. This is a great reminder for humanity to embrace the unknown. Life is all we are guaranteed once we're here and we may as well make the most of the mystery that we get to see unfold.Back to the Future Part II is a fun and engaging film suitable for the whole family. I miss the movies of the 80's that drew the teenage crowd but could still be enjoyed with your parents on the couch Sunday evening. A good lesson and a great story make for an enjoyable film experience. I will certainly be tuning in to the third installment of this series and hope it will be as enjoyable as the first two. I'm still waiting for a movie that doesn't show such a ghastly future with crazy fashions and hair, but I suppose, everything looked ghastly at one point or another.",6,0,0,11 January 2016
Tombstone," 'I'm your huckleberry'
","Tombstone tells the story of an aging Wyatt Earp who seeks to settle down and create some roots in Tombstone, Arizona. He is committed to changing his ways of womanizing and scuffling, in hopes of maintaining a business and a peaceful life. When you lie with dogs, however, you are unlikely to avoid getting fleas. With his gang of rascals helmed by Doc Holliday, trouble mounts. Holliday, much less committed to Earp's draw to a peaceful life seeks as much pleasure as possible, while enjoying life to the fullest. Earp's troubles go well beyond the confines of his own gang. Soon after arriving in Tombstone, Earp realizes that the cowboys that have run this town, and the law, are not willing to back down from their land without a fight. Another bright spot to Tombstone is a Miss Josephine Marcus, actress in the local theater who takes no time noticing Wyatt Earp, even though Earp tries to take his time noticing Miss Marcus. This love interest proves vital for Earp, as Josephine shows Wyatt how to seek and gain something from life, and how to enjoy it. Under attack, and unwilling to be scared away, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the rest of the gang set out to prove that the west is left to be won for anyone. Technically, this movie is a stunning success! Set against the sometimes mountainous, sometimes open plains of the Old West, each shot is a miniature piece of art that comes together to create a magnificent mural. This film also reached outside of the box (pun intended) and minimized the screen to remind the viewer of the stretched screen format in which many classic westerns were watched on. This nod proved useful to establishing the authenticity of a western filmed in the modern day. Also essential to providing the western flair that the audience expects was the multiple extreme close-up shots of faces dispersed throughout the film. These shots help set the tone, and the mood of each character by blocking out all other visual stimuli, oftentimes leaving only the eyes visible to the viewer. Not only did this camera work set the gritty western tone, but it added benefit of seeing the character as they were going through their struggles. Tombstone proves to be an exceptionally acted ensemble piece. Anytime you have a film composed of about 30 main actors, the likelihood of one character upstaging another or one character disappearing into the background proves great. In this film, however, this problem never occurred. Each actor had at least one moment in which their character shines, and their acting is noticed. For me, the standout was Val Kilmer. It is unfortunate for Val Kilmer that what turned out to be, possibly the best performance of his career happened in a year stacked with masterpiece performances of supporting actors. When you watch Kilmer's Doc Holliday, and you watch both his health deteriorate and his drunken stupor, you see a depth to the actor that I, for one, did not know was there. When immersed in the film, it is easy to immediately state that he should have taken home a statuette that year from the dear Academy. Then, when you remember that was also the year of honoring work like The Schindler's List, you remember Ralph Fiennes' performance snub. Kilmer's acting in this film is the pinnacle of his career, and he should have certainly, at least, been nominated for it. An all-star cast came together for Tombstone and it will not disappoint. A stellar ensemble performance, wonderfully casted, and a beautiful backdrop proves Tombstone a western force to be reckoned with.",7,0,0,7 December 2015
Ben-Hur," 'How do you fight an idea, especially a new idea'
","It was finally time to see what all 11 of those Oscar's were for in 1959, 11 Oscars for a single film is certainly a feat; and I was excited to see what film earned so many statuettes. I could not have been any more pleased with Ben-Hur. It was a wonderful visual spectacle that still amazes nearly 60 years after its debut. William Wyler's epic starring Charleton Heston in the title role is a true treat for the audience that won't even mind the 3.5-hour commitment it will take to finish this classic. Strap into your chariot, Ben- Hur is a film that any true fan of cinema should see at least once. Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a wealthy Jewish prince living in Jerusalem. His old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who once saved his life, has just been named Commanding Officer of the Roman legion. Despite their religious and political differences, Judah and Messala have remained friends through their life. However, after Judah realizes his friend has become power hungry and arrogant, he seeks distance between them. Then, at the welcome parade for the Romans, Judah and his sister watch from the roof of the house of Hur. When a loose roof tile falls and injures the Governor, Judah is blamed for the incident. He tries to explain the misunderstanding, but it falls on deaf ears and Messala, even knowing that Judah and his family are innocent, sends Judah to the galleys as a slave and throws his mother and sister in prison. Through many instances of good fortune, Judah survives the galleys, holding onto his Jewish faith and the wish to reunite with his mother and sister. After managing to return to Jerusalem, Judah goes on a quest to find his family. Along the way, Judah decides to exact revenge on his one-time friend.The colors, Duke, the colors! Maybe I'm the only one left that remembers that commercial; nonetheless, the colors in Ben-Hur were the most stand-out part of the film. The sets were remarkable, as well, especially given their grand scale. The screenplay and the storytelling was simply perfect. The story was paced so well, at the movie's credits you will hardly believe you sat through a nearly 4- hour spectacle. The costuming was phenomenal; true to life without being over the top. William Wyler made an excellent decision in the way he filmed scenes depicting Jesus. He never showed Jesus' face, which fit perfectly in the movie, as it was not about Jesus, but rather the plight of the Jews and the politics of the time. Wyler's decision was also a very reverent way to handle depicting a religious figure. The score and sound effects were exquisite and worked wonders to progress the film along. The special effects were divine, especially considering the film was made in 1959. What review of Ben-Hur could exist without mentioning that chariot scene? This scene alone cost $4 million dollars and lasted for 11 minutes. It was an incredible and well worth it scene for the movie. 'The chariot race' is not only the scene most remembered from Ben- Hur, but it is a scene that has gone down in cinema history. Once you finish Ben-Hur, you will not wonder why it took home 11 Oscars, it's more than evident and wildly deserving of every statuette it took home. An instant favorite, Ben-Hur is a visually pleasing work of art classic piece of cinema. Everything in this film comes together beautifully and will leave no one who invests their time in the picture disappointed. Even if you are not a fan of Charlton Heston's infamous overacting, give Ben-Hur a viewing and see for yourself how easy it is to overlook that one piece of this movie. It's easy to see why Ben-Hur has a place carved out in history that it will never be removed from.",10,3,5,11 April 2016
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","I finally found a Woody Allen film that didn't take place in New York that I enjoy. Vicky Cristina Barcelona isn't the first non-New York set Woody Allen film that I've liked, but it's one of only two. I've discussed this at length elsewhere so all I'll say here is Woody Allen just doesn't seem as comfortable behind the camera if he's working out of the country. Match Point is an obvious exception, as there is little to complain about regarding that outing. Anyway, the 2008 film written and directed by Woody Allen followed two best friends spending the summer in Barcelona. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as the pair of best friends, Vicky Cristina Barcelona explores unconventional relationships and the extent one can be fulfilled by sharing love.Two best friends that seem to be polar opposites plan a summer in Spain together before one of them is to wed. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) has always searched for a grounded love and a partner she can depend on as she is conventional in all aspects of life. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) has searched for a love that will set her soul on fire, one that is exciting and unpredictable. Their expectations have led them down different paths, Vicky will soon marry when she returns home, Cristina, who is single again after being hurt in her previous relationship. After a chance meeting with a Spanish painter, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) he invites the girls to travel with him on his private plane to a remote island. Ever the risk-taker, Cristina jumps at the chance for unprecedented excitement and intrigue. Vicky is much more hesitant, even attempting to talk Cristina out of going. They both eventually board the plane with Juan and make it to the island. Cristina becomes ill and it is Vicky that has a romantic evening with Juan. Feeling guilty and conflicted, Vicky leaves the island leaving Cristina and Juan to fall in love. Cristina believes she may have found the excitement in love she's been looking for, that is until Juan's ex- wife re-enters their lives.Social constructs and conventional love are explored in Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody explores what it means to love someone that also loves someone else. Living together in an open relationship and the dynamic of three people that love each other so much that they can't survive without each other but struggle to survive the terms of their relationship provides an interesting character and another fine example of the exploration of the psyche that Woody Allen is so proficient at. The score and cinematography are gorgeous and I'm so happy that the excellent Woody Allen script made a triumphant return. I recently read an interview with Woody Allen in which he lists guilt as a motivating factor to accomplish the things he doesn't want to do, which I found interesting considering the guilt Vicky felt after cheating on her husband filled such a huge part of her character arc. It's always interesting to learn more about a filmmaker and then be able to see more of them in their work than before. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is certainly not the first film of Woody's where guilt has played a large part but it's interesting noticing it after learning that guilt plays a huge factor in his own life.'Life is short, dull, and full of pain.'--Maybe Woody is right, but his films certainly help me cope with that.",9,0,0,28 July 2017
Sweet and Lowdown," Sweet and Lowdown
","If I maintained a 'bucket list', near the top of that list one would see 'Cafe Carlyle, Monday night, 8:45'. Perhaps the only thing more consistent in Woody Allen's life than his film production schedule is his clarinet playing. Woody played clarinet in a jazz band for 25 years before the venue closed, but that didn't stop Woody. He now plays where he has played for over a decade at the Carlyle Hotel with Woody Allen & the Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band. A fan of jazz since he was a teenager, which has shown in all of his films, I would love to see Woody Allen play clarinet in person. Perhaps the film in which Woody most clearly illustrates his love for jazz is in his 1999 feature, Sweet and Lowdown. The film brings back to life the 1930's through a guitarist Emmet Ray, who worships a better- known guitarist Django Reinhardt. Sean Penn brings to life the quirky self-sabotaging Ray with an unbelievable jazz soundtrack accompanying the film. In a beautifully raw tale of love and regret, Sweet and Lowdown is an entry of Woody Allen's filmography not to be missed. Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), the free-spirited, arrogant, alcoholic is also one of the best guitarists of his time. Despite his talent, he is thoroughly obsessed with the French gypsy guitarist, Django Reinhardt. Emmet only allows himself to idolize Django from afar, as he has a morbid fear of actually meeting the musician. Relayed through a mockumentary, a format Woody Allen had previously successfully explored, the audience hears from many people who knew Emmet Ray. It is revealed that Emmet Ray is largely unknown today because he refused to make too many recordings for fear that someone would copy his style. A colorful person with an unknown past has made Emmet an interesting character study. Emmet didn't care for others too much, living life as a womanizer and using prostitutes to fund his lifestyle. A complete eccentric, Emmet Ray was as unreliable in his music career as he was his personal life. Even finding true love wasn't enough to push Emmet beyond himself to deeply care about anyone else. Deciding to keep his focus on him alone, Emmet breaks up with Hattie (Samantha Morton), his one true love because he realizes himself to be incapable of returning the loyalty she gives to him. When he finally realizes his mistake, it is too late to get Hattie back and may be too late for Emmet to truly achieve happiness.Sweet and Lowdown, set in the heart of the jazz golden age in the 1930's, was filled with incredible period detail, maybe the best in a Woody Allen film up to that time. The film opens in a wonderful way with monologues of those that knew Emmet, making it clear that Woody Allen has dipped into the mockumentary style once again. The mockumentary is a sub-genre Woody Allen executes well, so seeing another from him was a treat. It probably goes without saying, but here I am to waste lines with it anyway, the score in Sweet and Lowdown is pitch perfect. The amazing jazz punctuating the plight of a devoted musician bring the emotion in Sweet and Lowdown to a fever pitch. The color used in Sweet and Lowdown was sensational bringing to life the heavy regret and emotional despair Emmet brought upon himself. Woody Allen perfectly explores someone who self-sabotages their relationships and must live with the regret of pushing away their one true love.",7,0,0,26 July 2017
The Deer Hunter," The Deer Hunter
","Another Best Picture winner about the Vietnam Conflict, The Deer Hunter took home Oscar's top prize in 1978. Directed by Michael Cimino, and starring big names such as Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale, The Deer Hunter is packed with action through an introspective lens. Again, I am not typically a fan of war movies, and again I can see why I've left the remaining films on the Best Picture list at the end.I was not impressed by The Deer Hunter. I found what could have been a rich story of war-torn people and friendships a sordid display of 'who can be the best actor' in a movie filled with stars unwilling to share top billing. Michael, Nick, and Steven (Robert De Niro), (Christopher Walken), and (John Savage) are factory workers who decide to give their lives purpose by enlisting in the Vietnam conflict. Just before deploying, Steven marries his pregnant girlfriend, and the men bid each other and everyone else adieu at the wedding party. The remainder of the story describes their struggles and shows their repeated efforts to reunite while engaged in war. The violence of battle changes the lives of everyone involved, and this movie painstakingly illustrates that. Constant disclaimer: Another viewing may change my perception of this film.",5,1,2,4 March 2016
The Producers," 'I want everything I've ever seen in the movies'
","It is incredible to think that The Producers was Mel Brooks' directorial debut. An incredible feat not just because the film remains a classic 50 years after its 1967 debut, but also because of its subject matter. Making a comedy about making a play about Adolf Hitler, one of the worst world leaders in world history seems like an odd vehicle to launch a career with. Nonetheless, Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel join together in a brilliant display of chemistry to tell the story of two producers who hatch a plan for mischief and riches, in a way only Mel Brooks can tell.Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), an aging Broadway producer is now relegated to attaining money for his productions by seducing wealthy seasoned women. One day, when Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), an accountant with White Hall and Marks meets Max to go over his books, the discovery of a fund-raising error gives Max an idea. If he were to raise a great deal amount more money than a play will cost, then selects a play that is sure to be a flop, the two will be infinitely wealthy since they will have no profits to pay the backers of the play. Leo, a perpetually nervous individual, is skeptical to go along with Max's plan. After Max takes Leo under his wing, shows him a good time, and treats him like a person, Leo agrees to help with the plan because for the first time in his life, he has found happiness. Springing into action to execute their plot; Max and Leo must find the worst play possible, a play that is so awful it is sure to only run one performance. Springtime for Hitler; a musical preaching the overlooked good qualities of Adolf Hitler looks like the perfect play for their plan. After meeting with the playwright, Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars) a German-born American with pictures of Hitler littering his walls, the three agree to bring the play to audiences. After the effeminate well-known terrible musical director Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett) is hired, the play is sure to be a disaster; the only way their plan could fail is if the play is a hit.Mel Brooks proves he was put on this earth to be a director with his debut film, The Producers. Arguably his best picture, his first film was an instant classic and clearly illustrated the type of parodies we could expect, and come to love from genius comedy director, Mell Brooks. Thankfully, years before The Producers came to be, Mel Brooks found Gene Wilder acting in a play with Mel's then girlfriend (and later wife) Anne Bancroft. Although it would be years before the pairing would come to fruition, Mel asked Gene if he would be interested in playing the part of Leo Bloom, and never forgot about him. Only his second film, The Producers was the first lead film role for Gene Wilder. From the bit part, he had in Bonnie and Clyde the same year, to sharing the lead in a film with Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder certainly proved to be quite the actor, and would go on to collaborate with Mel Brooks 2 more times, each classic in their own right.Wilder played the role of the neurotic nervous Bloom with great tenacity. It's hard not to sympathize with his character who just wants a friend and a purpose for his life. Always being a rule breaker had gained Leo nothing in his life except a mundane existence. Although the relationship with Max didn't come to the best of outcomes, it begs the question, does it matter what results in a friendship as long as it is real and fun?",9,0,1,3 June 2016
Rear Window," Rear Window
","My years-long quest to see everything Alfred Hitchcock has ever made finally lead me, albeit far too late, to Rear Window. Hitchcock's 1954 feature starring Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly has been revered and countlessly referenced in the 62 years since its release. The film in which a wheelchair bound photographer with nothing better to do than look out the window of his New York apartment at his various neighbors becomes convinced that one of them has committed a murder. Bringing together a brilliant display of the various lives that make up a neighborhood and how each human effects the other, Rear Window was a long overdue treat.After injuring himself on a photo shoot, L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is wheelchair-bound with a broken leg. Since Jeff is single, for the most part abhorring the idea of marriage, the only interaction he enjoys throughout his long days are the visits of his caretaker, an occasional guest, and his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly). In order to help the time pass as he recovers, Jeff has taken a liking to watching his neighbors from his large apartment window. Living varied lives, each with their own schedules and idiosyncrasies, Jeff becomes entranced learning more about their lives behind his binoculars. Among his watching, Jeff notices a traveling salesman with a bed-ridden wife at home. He watches him take care of his wife and begins to learn his schedule. One day, Jeff notices that salesman's wife has disappeared and his schedule has drastically changed. The collection of oddities has Jeff convinced that his neighbor has killed his wife. Jeff is so convinced that he shares this belief with his girlfriend and caretaker, who initially dismiss him, then go on to help him. With no proof, the threesome hatches a plan to implicate the neighbor with murder by entering his apartment, even if it costs them their lives.Now I understand why I like the film Disturbia so much. I saw the 2007 version of Rear Window first, and was stunned that I liked it so much, being as I am no fan of Shia LaBeouf's; after seeing Rear Window, however, I can appreciate my liking of Disturbia more as it is basically a remake of the Hitchcock classic. I was initially disappointed to see that Rear Window was a color film, for some reason I thought I remembered that it was in black and white, but I got over it quickly when I first saw Jimmy Stewart; really, is he in anything that's not completely splendid? I really enjoy watching films by British directors, as I love the emphasis on dialogue within the films. Rear Window, had a wonderful emphasis on dialogue and the three principles delivered the lines quite well. There was a great deal of fun effects throughout this film, including the fun way Hitch filmed through the lenses of Jeff's camera and binoculars. Rear Window is a fantastic example of a distinction Hitch himself was sure to make; he made suspense pictures, not mysteries. It really doesn't matter to the film whether or not the man actually killed his wife, what is paramount, however, is the quest endured by the actors to find out whether or not Jeff's neighbor is a murderer. Another gripping suspense from the ultimate master in the genre, it is easy to see why Rear Window is the classic it has become.",9,3,4,26 October 2016
Looper," Looper
","About midway through these genre months, I find myself itching for a little bit of more of a variety with the movies I'm watching. Luckily, Looper was just different enough for me to avoid the mid- month genre fatigue. Director Rian Johnson brings together veteran actor Bruce Willis and emerging star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a team, of sorts in this time travel drama. An interesting look at a future that utilizes time travel, Looper is riddled with sharp dialogue and gritty, dark photography sure to capture the audience's attention.In the future of 2074, time travel is possible and utilized, but forbidden to all, unless you are a Looper. Loopers are hit men who are paid to kill criminals sent to them 30 years in the past. A Looper named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is desperately searching for something of worth in his otherwise miserable drug-fueled life. Just roaming through his life, Joe kills and stashes away his reward hoping for a respite to France in the future. One day, Joe gets the job of his life, literally, when his future self (Bruce Willis) is sent to him. The only way to close a loop in this universe is for the 2074 self to be killed by the 2044 self in the past. Joe hesitates, and his future self escapes, determined to kill the boy in the past who will grow to be the man responsible for his wife's death. Realizing he has committed a grave mistake, Joe chases his future self, eventually getting a step ahead of him. Landing on a farm that Joe believes his future self is coming to in search of the boy, Joe finds a single mother and her son on the farm and soon learns there is more to her son than meets the eye. Deciding, selflessly, to protect them, Joe comes face-to-face with his future self, and must make a crucial decision.Dark cinematography was used throughout the film, and it lent itself well to the dark feelings experienced by the Loopers who were simply killing until they killed themselves. The darkness also lends itself well to the extreme isolation that affects everyone in this universe. An unexpected standout in the film was the little boy, Cid played by Pierce Gagnon. A wonderful performance with deep emotions, the child actor shines. Great performances by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt aided by rich dialogue go a long way toward the staying power of this film.Looper is a fun, yet serious film for the sci-fi genre. Complete with action, but not over the top, it was a good submission for the time travel sub-genre. I would recommend this film to sci-fi fans, as well as fans of the two lead actors. We especially see Gordon- Levitt branch out beautifully from the characters he typically portrays. Hopefully, also, we see more of the standout Pierce Gagnon.",6,1,2,20 January 2016
Gangs of New York," Gangs of New York
","Visually stunning, if not oddly cast, Marin Scorsese directed Gangs of New York in 2002. Weaving the tale of the development of an area of New York known as the Five Points, all the while following a man seeks revenge for the murder of his father. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, Gangs of New York tells the darker tale of the origins of the country during the Civil War. Perhaps one of Scorsese's most visually striking vivid films, Gangs of New York was nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 2002, cementing Scorsese's iconic reputation as a director.Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), as a child, witnesses his father, 'Priest' Vallon's (Liam Neeson) death in a gruesome battle with a rival gang member, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). After avoiding a life of living under Bill's supervision, Amsterdam makes it his life's mission to exact revenge on the man who killed his father. In 1863, Amsterdam returns to The Five Points which is being run by The Butcher and his gang, many members of which used to belong to The Priest's gang. Life in The Five Points is hellish for anyone who isn't a member of The Butcher's gang. They run the state like it's their own, are blatantly anti-immigration, womanizing, and exceptionally violent. The forced conscription brought about by the Civil War brought with it the most turbulent of times for the fledgling state of New York, and the entire country itself. Riots break out in the street protesting the corruption in government and the violence used to rule the citizens. The violence acts as a perfect backdrop, keeping The Butcher just distracted enough for Amsterdam to exact revenge for the murder of his father.The filming of the opening battle scene was a stroke of brilliance by director Martin Scorsese, complete with his signature God's eye view overhead shots. Leonardo DiCaprio, despite being a stock actor of Scorsese's, seemed ill-fit for the role of a son seeking revenge. He lacked the deep-seeded revenge angle needed for the role in place of the overly facial pretty boy he is so constantly lauded for playing. Cameron Diaz is completely miscast in the role, of the love interest, never coming off as fitting in the period. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wonderful performance, as always, brilliantly capturing the violent, yet philosophizing gang leader. Scorsese delivered his most visually stunning film to date with his 2002 feature, Gangs of New York.",7,0,1,18 December 2016
The Breakfast Club," The Breakfast Club
","'Teen King' John Hughes wrote and directed The Breakfast Club in 1985. The stacked cast included Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, and Ally Sheedy in a film that chronicled the life of 5 high school students from different backgrounds and social circles forced to spend a Saturday in detention together. Breaking out of their shells and opening up to each other prove to the group that they're not as different as they initially seem. A brilliant ensemble piece with exceptional character development and engaging dialogue cement The Breakfast Club as one of the seminal films of the 80's.Andrew Clark (the jock), Claire Standish (the princess), Brian Johnson (the nerd), John Bender (the criminal), and Ally Sheedy (the basket case) are forced to spend 9 hours together locked inside their high school in detention on a Saturday in March. They are supervised by Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) their principle who has reached the end of his rope with high school students has decided to force the students to write 1,000-word essays describing who they think they are. Initially, the question seems easy, as each student has been pigeon-holed into a label that they have subsequently assumed. As the day drags on, their walls are broken down and they begin to realize they aren't who the world thinks they are. Their motives for their actions are tested, and each of their facades gives way to reveal a whole person who is much more complex that even they realized before their detention began. Not only does each member of the group develop a better understanding of themselves, but they also begin to better understand each other, as well.The emotional complexity of The Breakfast Club is its brightest light. The film is able to tackle abuse, both emotional and physical, neglect, and failing to meet expectations in an incredibly relatable way that avoids the pitfall of being either over-indulgent or preachy. Not only do we gain a full understanding of the hardships of each student, but we gain an understanding of Richard Vernon, as well. A character who initially comes across as a throw-away character is actually riddled with layers, as well. Through long scenes with rich artful dialogue, each character in the film is fully fleshed out, a rarity in such an ensemble piece. With a cast of such well-known names, I was a bit surprised to see one actor seeming to carry the film. Each scene with Judd Nelson's Bender is so critical to the plot, and he plays his character so well, I can't imagine anyone else in the role. With so many seemingly little moments, such as Ally Sheedy's 'basket case' attempting to look in the window at her parent before the car abruptly pulls away establishing the neglect for her character, really gives the audience the sense that every aspect of the film exists for a specific reason. The payoff is always magnified when each shot of a film adds to its resolution, making The Breakfast Club a true standout of its generation.",8,0,0,11 April 2017
Gladiator," Gladiator
","Epicly April got off to a, well, epic start with my viewing of Gladiator. The Academy Award Best Picture winner for 2000 was definitely grand in scale. Ridley Scott has turned in an illustrious career making impressive films, and Gladiator certainly belongs in this category. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix lead the cast in this tale of revenge against a corrupt Emporer. A gripping tale of avenging the death of one's family, Gladiator keeps audiences on the edge of their seats through the entire 2.5-hour film. Maximus (Russel Crowe) is a adored General for the Roman army. He is even loved by the aging Emporer Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When Aurelius tells his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) that he intends to crown Maximus Emporer over his own blood, Commodus takes this as the ultimate betrayal. After murdering his own father, Commodus assumes power, as no one knew of Marcus Aurelius' intentions to crown Maximus. Commodus then goes on to condemn Maximus to death and sends henchmen to murder his family. Defying odds, Maximus escapes his execution and hurries back in an attempt to save his wife and child. Too late to save them, Maximus is taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator. Maximus gets through his days by hoping that he will eventually be able to exact revenge against Commodus and fulfill his own Emporer, Marcus Aurelius', dying wish. The day finally comes in which Maximus' gladiator troupe is called to fight in the coliseum of Emporer Commodus to participate in a marathon of gladiator challenges. Joining together with Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) who wishes to bring democracy to Rome, and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) daughter to Marcus Aurelius and sister to Commodus who bore Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) heir to the throne of his Uncle and is deathly afraid of her brother, the gang of misfits attempts to bring about the demise of Commodus. Gladiator looks like the spectacle you would imagine it to look like. The sounds and score were perfect for the film and made you feel like you needed to wipe the sand out of your eyes because you were so involved in the action. My favorite part, like others I'm sure, was the scene with Russel Crowe fighting the tigers in the coliseum. The scene looked like reality and thankfully wasn't bogged down with CGI. Russel Crowe played the brooding warrior exceptionally and was matched in talent with Joaquin Phoenix's sanctimonious turn as the self- righteous Emporer. Gladiator was a real tour-de-force as far as the acting was concerned. Another stand out was the stark colors sprinkled throughout the film, especially in the costumes. Janty Yates certainly pulled all the stops designing the costumes worn in this epic and was more than worthy of her Oscar for Best Costume Design. It is the scenes in the coliseum that show just how many extras were used in this movie and acts as further proof that Ridley Scott more than deserved the gold statuette for Best Director he took home from the 2000 Oscar ceremony. Everything came together so well in Gladiator that I can more than see why audiences and critics alike have few negative words for this film. Gladiator is driven by the vehicle of revenge. Maximus wants nothing more than to kill Commodus, both because he is responsible for the death of Maximus' own wife and child, and because it was the wish of Marcus Aurelius for Commodus to die and Maximus to take the thrown. Seeking revenge gives Maximus' life purpose after his escape from death and the loss of his family. Maximus' laser focus on revenge fuels every aspect of Maximus' day and one is left to wonder if this idea of revenge turns into an obsession and if it is healthy. Granted, Maximus gives his life purpose with the goal of revenge, but he is set upon killing which never seems to right any wrongs. The theme works in this film and is paced so well that the audience is engaged throughout the entire film. I am happy that a month of viewing epics had brought me Gladiator, a film I am guaranteed to see again and again.",9,0,0,11 April 2016
Back to the Future," Back to the Future, Finally.
","I was definitely late to the party on this one. I missed out on watching this at anytime over the past 26 years of my life, and I also missed watching it during the anniversary event in October 2015. I believe the adage is 'better late than never', I hope it is anyway. No matter how late I was to this film, I'm glad I watched it. Back to the Future was a wonderful tale of ingenuity, diligence, and retribution. Michael J. Fox teams up with Christopher Lloyd in a quest finish his greatest invention and freely travel the realms of time.Our story begins in 1985, as we are introduced to Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a quintessential American teenager, forever embarrassed of his parents and seeking independence. His friendship with the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is well- established as he is in tuned to the many experiments he is in the process of developing. When Doc is ready to unveil his creation, he asks Marty to meet him at the mall in the middle of the night. Shocked at Doc's explanation that he has uncovered the secret ingredient needed to power his time machine, Marty is intrigued. When a terrible accident takes place, Marty is accidentally send to November 12th, 1955 where his entire existence hangs in the balance, as he must be sure that his parents to-be meet and fall in love, in spite of the fact that his entry into the past has disrupted this. The audience accompanies Marty through a nostalgic look at life in the 50's, and all that Marty introduces to the past. Marty's trip culminates with a big finale that must spark him back to his present.No one talks about Back to the Future without mentioning the incredible on-screen chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Despite their vast differences in age, they pull off a believable well-established friendship beautifully on-screen. Several scenes throughout involve just the two of them, a type of movie in which chemistry is crucial. Another bright spot of the film is the shooting. With many special effects, especially in the climax, it needs to be believable or the story would fall apart. Robert Zemeckis obviously directs a beauty with Back to the Future and is a joy for audiences from beginning to end.A powerful message emerges as one watches Back to the Future. Many of the film's leads at one point has their character questioned. At the beginning of the film we meet George McFly (Crispin Glover), who doesn't look like he's strayed far from the 1950's even in the 80's. He is getting pushed around in the film, like he has all of his life, and seems to be destined for a life filled with this type of abuse. He seems to have no respect from his family members, or anyone else that comes into contact with him. Marty shows us, through his journey that sometime all it takes to make someone realize they deserve better is a little confidence from a friend. We also learn early on in the film that Marty has a passion for music and a dream to pursue it. He gets a big chance to realize this musical dream at his parent's dance in the past. He convinces his dad to pursue his own writing dream when he visits him in 1955, and seeing his father's dream pan out, one can only assume Marty will take his own advice in the future. One can also take a lesson from Doc Brown's perseverance throughout the film. He is never appreciated for his ingenuity, and often thought of as crazy for pursuing his scientific endeavors. In spite of all this criticism, Doc presses on and remains steadfast in his scientific exploits. There is something in this film for everyone, and the audience is given enough tools to find whatever suits them.Now that I have finally seen Back to the Future, I can understand why it has remained such a staple for decades after its release. This story provides a feel good story of normal, good people overcoming the evils of other normal people. Not an overwhelming moral story to the point where it is cheesy and unbelievable, but one that tugs at this reviewer's heartstrings nonetheless. Back to the Future is a four star prize for me, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes to follow an engaging story with fun characters. One does not even have to be a fan of time travel movies, as I am not, to enjoy this film. I'm glad I finally gave this movie a chance, and I will probably be along for the whole series.",7,0,0,11 January 2016
Goodfellas," Goodfellas
","'As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.'Every single time we had to do the pointless and awkward introduction in my undergrad classes, Henry Hill's opening monologue was always my response. This achieved a couple goals for me, I avoided having to actually articulate the fact that I wanted to run for office, and I also got to see if there were any hidden cinephiles scattered around me. It never really worked; occasionally I would find another fan of the film, but never someone with a broad film taste who didn't suggest we watch Scarface as a double feature with Goodfellas. Martin Scorsese, one of the Kings of New York settled on adapting the novel by Nicholas Pileggi following the life of Henry Hill as he rose to prominence in the Brooklyn mafia. Starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the work of a true auteur in top form and has remained a mafia classic 27 years after its release. Growing up in a modest home with blue collar parents, Henry Hill saw a way to make everything he had ever wanted his. Henry saw how the 'wiseguys' in his neighborhood lived, and wanted to be like them and have the freedom to go anywhere they wanted while wearing the best clothes and constantly having hundred dollar bills to flash. Henry started small as a child then a teenager, along with his friend Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) advancing in the mafia with each passing year. Learning the ins and outs, the rules and orders, the intricate details of the mafia--like only one could see from the inside, Henry had no problem paying his dues and earning his place. When Henry is really initiated and deemed worthy of meeting the higher ranks, he is introduced to Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). Conway, Hill, and DeVito become something of a dream team executing some of the biggest robberies and hijackings the country had ever seen. Henry's life comes crashing down when he's 'pinched' and must take the fall for a crime. While in jail, Hill enters the drug trade making more money at less of a split than he ever had before. After his jail sentence is complete, mob boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) assures Henry that he will be fine in the mafia once again. He understood that Henry had to deal in drugs to keep himself and his family afloat while in prison, but he has to give that up as Paulie isn't involved in the drug trade. Living better than he ever had before, however, meant that Hill had no intentions of leaving the drug trade behind. Staying involved in drugs and becoming an addict himself got Hill into a world of trouble and the only way he can get out is by bringing about the downfall of the two people closest to him, the two he had spent nearly his whole life with, Jimmy and Tommy.In an expert maneuver, Martin Scorsese begins in the middle of the story, then traces to the beginning through the end. The story structure of Goodfellas is one to marvel at, and certainly one that wouldn't have been so flawlessly executed without director Martin Scorsese. Goodfellas is so engaging that I can't tell you how many times I've seen it, and yet, if I walk into a room in which it is playing I will watch until the end. From the perfect execution of the introductory scenes, which are often a rather boring part in other films, to the brilliant in-depth character development, Goodfellas is a film to study for its narrative. An astute viewer is given such a complete glimpse into the men's lives that one can see where the character's failings exist that will eventually bring them down. Some of the best tracking shots in cinema history are contained within Goodfellas. The one fans of the film love to discuss are the scene in which Henry and his eventual wife are shown across the street as their car is getting parked and followed by the camera all the way in through the kitchen then through the front of the restaurant. It's a beautiful shot lasting two full minutes, and that's just one example of directorial prowess concerning tracking shots. My personal favorite occurs during the scene in which the audience is introduced to the mafia members. The camera slides down the length of the bar as we learn the names of those in the Brooklyn mafia as well as certain character traits they possess. One of my favorite parts of the film is the way its narration changes seamlessly between Henry and Karen Hill. We go from hearing Henry's voice then his wife's, then back to Henry's voice again all the while changing the point of view but the audience never misses a step and the narrative is never sloppy. Put simply, Goodfellas is a master class in filmmaking from a director who is no stranger to making classic films. Goodfellas on its own would be enough for any director to hang their hat on, but the fact that the same director was also behind Raging Bull and Taxi Driver speaks to the greatness of Martin Scorsese. I'll never get over what happened to Tommy, though.",10,1,2,19 June 2017
Sully," Sully
","Since around the year 2000, I've adopted a rule to see any film Clint Eastwood has been involved with, and largely that is a rule that has proved fruitful. Sully, the 2016 film directed by Eastwood, was another shining example of the mastery of Eastwood behind the lens. Starring Tom Hanks in the titular role, along with Aaron Eckhart as the co- pilot no one knows, Sully tells the story of the miraculous landing of a US Airways flight on the Hudson River in 2009. Audiences everywhere remember that fateful day, and can recall being captivated by the newsreel footage that overtook American TV screens; what we didn't know, however, was the tumult Captain Sullenberger endured with the National Transportation Safety Board. Exposing this untold aspect of the story, and delving deeper into the psyche of the veteran pilot after his difficult landing, makes Sully a film not to be missed.Thursday, January 15th, 2009, is a day that started off like any other workday for Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Sully) (Tom Hanks) the 42-year veteran pilot. After settling into the cockpit for another flight, Sully performs all of his pre-flight checklist with first officer, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). When all systems are go, Sully and the crew take off with 155 total people on board the plane. Moments after takeoff, a flight of Canadian geese fly straight towards the plane disabling both engines. As everything begins to fail, Sully makes the decision to reroute back to LaGuardia where the plane departed from. When the plane loses thrust and altitude at an alarming rate, Sully decides they will not be able to make it back to the airport, and is now faced with how to execute an emergency landing and save as many people on board as he possibly can. The only option that seems available to Sully is to attempt a landing on the Hudson River. An unprecedented water landing is, by no means, an easy undertaking, especially on a frigid 20-degree day. Sully did the unthinkable, not only successfully landing the aircraft, but doing so with no loss of life. Remaining on board until the last possible moment, making sure all passengers were off the plane, then taking the flight manifest with him to be able to account for all the passengers, Sully acted as a true captain to every soul who happened to board U.S. Airways flight 1549. That's the part of the story the audience knows, what we didn't know was the tumult Sullenberger went through with the National Transportation Safety Board, who was dealing with the insurance fallout following such an emergency landing. The ensuing investigation threatened to ruin Sullenberger's career and his burgeoning aviation safety consulting business. The investigation threatened Sully's lifework, and pension, all while being touted as a national hero. Sullenberger fought for his livelihood while dealing with the debilitating fallout of the traumatic experience he endured. It is easy to think about the passengers onboard the flight and the harrowing experience they went through, but it is easy to forget that Captain Sullenberger went through the same traumatic experience, with the added stress of being responsible for every life on board, as well. An amazing insight to the man who captivated a nation, Sully is sure to gain some Oscar buzz, and one not to be missed. Clint Eastwood attempts the incredibly difficult task of taking a story that everyone knows and telling it in a captivating way. Eastwood definitely achieves this feat, as the audience is on the edge of their seat, even though they already know the outcome of the story. Eastwood, choosing to inject the following NTSB investigation into Captain Sullenberger's actions was a stroke of brilliance, allowing the audience to become engrossed and possibly enraged with another aspect of his heroic story, that we may not otherwise have known. I am no fan of Tom Hanks, I actually prefer to only watch him in a movie if I can forget that he is the actor I am watching on screen; that being said, Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Captain Sullenberger. He embodies the extremely focused, almost militant Sullenberger in a fantastic way. Aaron Eckhart was also a brilliant selection for the strong supporting role of the first officer who was a necessity to Sullenberger's unprecedented landing. Sound acting choices and the brilliance of Clint Eastwood behind the camera create a wonderful story of one man's heroic feat that gave New York some much needed plane-related good news.",7,0,2,19 September 2016
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park
","I have a love/hate relationship with Steven Spielberg's films. The relationship has been more hate than love, but after recently watching Jaws I have decided to move the gauge closer to the middle. Anyway, Jurassic Park did little to move the gauge closer to the 'love' column. The popular 1993 adventure directed by Spielberg starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum about a modern-day park in which dinosaurs roam free, was plagued by poor pacing and over-the-top effects use of the famous director.Through decades of scientific work and development, John Hammond, a wealthy financier has developed a park in which real dinosaurs he has developed through cloning from mosquitos over a million years old. Once he recruits scientists Ellie (Laura Dern) and Grant (Sam Neill) and brings along mathematician Malcolm, Hammond thinks he is on easy street for securing his park and bringing dinosaurs to a public that would otherwise never experience them in real life. After a park employee attempts to steal embryos and the dinosaurs break free, it becomes a race for their lives while dinosaurs walk free around the planet once again.I am just the biggest fan of Laura Dern, so anytime she is a lead in a film is a treat to be enjoyed. Dern was fantastic in her role as the awestruck scientist. You feel her watching her dreams come true as she watches the manufactured dinosaurs in their natural habitats. You can see the prime directorial efforts in each scene. The audience is able to recognize that Spielberg is really pulling more from his actors than he does in other films. In order to create the world of Jurassic Park, the reactions of the actors must be larger than life, and Spielberg was able to elicit those reactions lending to the credibility of the film. Jeff Goldblum was a fun surprise in this film. Having no experience with him as an actor, I was pleasantly surprised with his performance. He was fun, and serious when it called for it, creating a nice bit of comic relief to a predominately stuffy cast. The acting was definitely the standout of this Jurassic Park and was the only aspect lending credibility to an otherwise over-the-top CGI ridden film.An inventive concept, a great cast, and larger than life characters, Jurassic Park should have been a home-run, and it largely was among audiences of the time. Going back to revisit the film, however, exposes the film's weaknesses. The Achilles heel Jurassic Park suffers is its pacing. Far too much is fleshed out in explaining each aspect of the creation of the dinosaurs, with nearly an hour passing before we even see any dinosaurs. The action scenes make up for the slow start to a point, but it would have been nicer to focus on more actuality of the dinosaurs rather than the concepts of what brought them about. Of course, the audience needs to understand how the dinosaurs came to be, but not to exhaustive detail. Exhaustive detail is precisely what you get with Jurassic Park; one of the many movies, I feel, whose sequels surpass the originals.",5,1,10,11 August 2016
Valkyrie," Valkyrie
","I had seen Valkyrie, the 2008 film by Bryan Singer at the cinema, and I anxiously awaited its DVD release. I was gifted the DVD shortly after release and watched it for a few months straight several times. I added it to my June schedule after realizing I hadn't seen it in nearly 10 years since those months passed just after the DVD release, to see if it held up for me. I was happy to learn that it did, which is not always the case in a film I liked at the time of release after year pass. Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise and Kenneth Branagh in a retelling of the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler and political coup plotted by renegade German Army officers. Historical films are a tough batch if you're historically inclined and know the outcome of what's being filmed, and Valkyrie managed to sustain suspense despite knowing how the plot turned out. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) has been severely damaged, like many, by WWII. Losing an eye and an arm in battle, Colonel Stauffenberg along with many others has come to the conclusion that an honorable surrender is the only way out of the war. The problem with the idea of an honorable surrender is the fact that Adolf Hitler would have to be eliminated in order for that to take place. All previous attempts on Hitler's life had failed so Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg has been recruited to head this attempt. In order for this attempt to work, Operation: Valkyrie must be changed to enable the members of the coup to take control of Berlin in the event of Hitler's demise. As the coup members go to work plotting an assassination of Hitler and a military takeover of Berlin, their plan is thwarted by a series of failings and a rout of bad luck.I remember being in the minority on the issue of the switch to English from German at the beginning of the film, and I was still unbothered by the change in language despite being a fan of foreign cinema. Granted, I'm usually on board for inventive methods of storytelling, but the language shift left me equally as unfazed ten years later. the most fulfilling part for me of waiting so long between viewings was being more familiar with the actors in the film. I had never seen a Kenneth Branagh film before the first time I saw Valkyrie, but I had heard about him a great deal; ten years later, however, I am familiar with Branagh and recognized him immediately in Valkyrie. The same can be said with my experience with Eddie Izzard. I had never even heard his name before my first viewing of Valkyrie, Izzard is well known to me now, and it was a treat to see him in such a role. I'm a classic film fan so I don't often get as much experience with contemporary actors as I probably should so this was a fun exercise in recognition that comes with ten years of cinema maturation. The pacing in Valkyrie was perfect building tension through the end of the film beautifully despite one knowing how the film ends. I was also especially stricken by the lighting of the film. Valkyrie was lit in a way that often evoked a dream-like state while simultaneously providing a ripped-from-the- past historical drama feel, as well. Adding to the tension of the well- paced film was the score, filling the audience with a sense of unease at every turn. Valkyrie is a strong war drama, which well utilizes a unique method of storytelling gripping audiences until the final credits roll; I'm glad the film held up.",9,0,1,19 June 2017
All the President's Men," 'It's a non-denial denial.'
","Alan J. Pakula directed, in 1976, a film with such rich source material as the nation's first ever president to resign, Richard Nixon. All the President's Men, starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, as the two reporters for The Washington Post that uncovered the details of the Watergate break-in that spanned all the way to the White House involving the president. Reminding the audience of a time in which the printed word reigned supreme and reporters were also detectives, capable of uncovering anything, All the President's Men was a brilliantly written film, incredibly deserving of taking home Oscar's top prize for Best Original Screenplay.As the 1972 presidential election is upon the nation, there is a break-in at the Watergate. Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) begins investigating the break-in, believing there to be deeper implications behind the break-in. Inserting himself into Woodward's work on the story, fellow reporter Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) begins investigating as well. Both men are a bit on the outs with the paper, with Woodward being newer on the staff and Bernstein who rarely finishes his stories. The two are an unlikely duo for such serious work, yet begin getting answers that are impressing and surprising themselves and their colleagues. Along with the constant guidance from Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook) to 'follow the money' which leads them to uncover large amounts of money being deposited into the accounts of the Watergate burglars and where that money came from exposing how high up the ladder the money trail goes. The closer they get to the truth, the more desperate the implicated parties are to squash the story, the reporter's reputations, and The Washington Post itself.I had been meaning to see All the President's Men for some time but continually avoided it due to a distaste of Dustin Hoffman's acting. I still hold out hope that I just haven't seen the right Hoffman films so I finally saw Pakula's 1976 feature. Dustin Hoffman was perfect in the seedy, underhanded role of Carl Bernstein. An added surprise was seeing Martin Balam's name rolling by on the opening credits. No matter how small his role is, he always brings great dimensions to his character. Robert Redford was also brilliantly cast as the diligent, serious reporter, Bob Woodward. In fact, Robert Redford may have been best in this role and truly missed out on any acclaim from Oscar for this role. All the President's Men, the better-acted version of the 2015 film Spotlight, has within it a recipe for a boring movie. Reporters gathering facts, typing, talking amongst themselves, and dead-ends are highlighted brilliantly against the perfect production design of the film preventing the audience from realizing the movie spans nearly two and a half hours. Alan J. Pakula also shows his directorial prowess by picking the absolute perfect place to end his film, at the inauguration of Richard Nixon's second term in office. The audience knows what's coming, we're invested in the work the reporting duo has done and are acutely aware that the seemingly perfect scene of Richard Nixon accepting office is nothing of the illusion that it seems. Closing the film with the public looking one way while the reporters are in the background of the shot, feverishly working on the story that will bring the president's misdeeds to the nation was a stroke of brilliance, sure to stay with the audience long after the film ends.",8,1,1,7 November 2016
The Wizard of Oz," 'Anybody can have a brain, that is a very mediocre commodity.'
","The Wizard of Oz is one of the films that changed the way I look at movies. First enjoying The 1939 film by Victor Fleming as a childhood favorite, revisiting the film, proved it to be so much more than a kid's movie. When I was about 20 and in college, I really started appreciating film as the art form that it is and respecting it as such. In gaining this new understanding for the medium as a serious art rather than mindless entertainment, I sought out favorite films of mine to see if I could gain any deeper understanding of them, and perhaps, appreciate or enjoy them more. One of the first films I watched through this new lens was The Wizard of Oz. Starring Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, and Billie Burke in the film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz follows a small town girl into the world she discovers as she only wishes to return home to the life she didn't realize she loved. No matter how simple the film seems on its surface, Baum packed quite a punch in his book, which was more than adequately transferred to the screen.Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a simple young girl living in Kansas on her Auntie Em's (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry's (Charley Grapewin) farm. Frustrated with her family after they agree to take her dog Toto away after nipping at a neighbor, Dorothy contemplates running away. When a tornado rips through the farm, she and her dog Toto are deposited into a magical world called Oz. Everything in Oz is different and beautiful. There is a unique class of people called munchkins, there are talking scarecrows, and tin woodsmen, there are witches, there are even lions and tigers and bears. The more Dorothy learns about the land of Oz, the more she wants to find a way to go back home, as soon as she can. In order to get back home, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda (Billie Burke) instructs Dorothy that she will need to travel to Emerald City and request to go home of the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan). In order to get there, Dorothy must follow the yellow brick road, that leads all the way to The Emerald Palace where the Wizard lives. To protect herself through the travels, Dorothy is given a pair of Ruby slippers, much sought after by the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) who will stop at nothing to get them. Fortunately for Dorothy, she meets friends along the way to Emerald City. She meets a talking scarecrow, who wishes to ask the Wizard for a brain, a tin woodsman who is seeking a heart from the Wizard, and a talking lion who wishes to be granted courage from the Wizard. Each with a special request and believing only that the Wizard of Oz can fulfill them, they travel along the yellow brick road hoping to be granted their destinies. In a race against the wicked witch, the group hopes to reach the Wizard of Oz before being thwarted by evil. There are a number of technical achievements that The Wizard of Oz boasts, of these is probably the most beautiful revealing transformation scene in cinema history. One would struggle to find someone unfamiliar with the door first opening to Oz revealing the technicolor wonder revealed to the audience. There is a good reason that this reveal is so engrained in the hearts of audiences forever. The coloration used in The Wizard of Oz is not only striking for 1939 but is still striking today, nearly 80 years after the film's release. It was also the brilliant transition from the sepia tones that the film had used until Dorothy entered Oz. This was a brilliant directorial decision to contrast the bleak simple world Dorothy had known until she was thrust into the world greatly different than her own. Many times since has this device been copied in films proving that so many filmmakers and film genres have much to owe to The Wizard of Oz. In addition to the beautiful shooting of the film, the writing comes to mind instantly as a standout piece of the film. I struggle to think of another film as quoted as The Wizard of Oz, from the exclamation of the Wicked Witch when she promises Dorothy 'I'll get you my pretty' to the realization Dorothy has when landing in Oz 'Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore', no other film has been imitated and quoted as much as The Wizard of Oz. The Wizard of Oz also comes with it, quite a thematic punch. Brimming to the top with symbolism, The Wizard of Oz really opened my eyes to how much cinema can say without overtly saying it. Each of the main characters means something deep and different than it would appear on screen, and there is room for each audience member to see what they will in each character. Just like going to an art gallery and 40 people seeing 40 different aspects of the same painting, film creates the same opportunities to see something deep and beautiful within it, if you only look for it. Whether you see industry titans in the tin man, politicians in the lion, farmers in the scarecrow, or the exploited working class in the munchkins; film has within it as much depth as any other art medium. The Wizard of Oz was my first introduction to film as art, and I am eternally grateful for what a viewing of a favorite film with a fresh perspective has afforded me for my years to come. I suppose I was somewhat like Dorothy before she opened the door to Oz, comfortable and unknowing; I'm glad for both of us that the door to that technicolor world has been opened.",10,6,7,22 August 2016
The Godfather," The Godfather
","Watching The Godfather is an event. Clocking in at five minutes shy of three hours and having some of the most epochal dialogue in the history of film, watching The Godfather is taking part in something that has forever changed the landscape of cinema. Mario Puzo's novel that he himself helped adapt into the 1972 film by Francis Ford Coppola offered a groundbreaking insight into the world of an organized crime dynasty. Highlighting the human beings associated with such death and destruction certainly took audiences by storm in the early 70's, and continues to do so today. Seeing the origin of where a number of cinema's most iconic lines came from is a truly magnificent journey, and one certainly worth the three-hour investment. Opening with a lavish and joyful wedding scene, a certain ominousness lurks beneath the smiles. The Godfather sets its tone exquisitely in its opening moments with the introduction of 'Don' Vito Corleone, played excellently by Marlon Brando in arguably his most celebrated role. We learn in just a few minutes from both the body language of those around him and their willingness to please that Don Corleone is an important man with immeasurable influence. His influence is so great that, on this, the day of (his) daughter's wedding, there is a list of those approved to see him. In perhaps one of the most talked about film openings, we see Brando with his oft-imitated manner of speaking and his accidental side-kick of a small cat (a stray that had wondered on the set), delivering a speech that has left an indelible imprint on pop culture since its utterance. The Godfather came out nearly 20 years before I was even born so I have heard lines from the film repeated for years. Somehow this film has avoided oversaturation and seeing the lines delivered from the characters onscreen was as fresh as hearing them for the first time. I was amazed to learn with this viewing that The Godfather is nearly a three-hour film. It is one of the films I watch with rapt attention every time I see it and is the perfect slow burn, that it has never felt like an overlong film. The coloration achieved is mesmerizing, as I almost feel like I'm watching the intimate home movies of the family onscreen. A brilliant and elegant score by Nino Rota captivates the audience and informs us of the mood of each scene. In an interesting way, however, it also runs a contrast to the mood onscreen. In a move that has often been imitated, but never to achieve the effect of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola juxtaposed many happy and celebratory scenes with sinister ones. The most discussed example of such juxtaposition is the scene in which Michael Corleone, expertly played by Al Pacino, is becoming a Godfather to his sister Connie's (Talia Shire) baby at the same time that he is becoming the Godfather to the Corleone family. The baptism scene taking place in a brilliant church with beautiful stained glass and a menacing echo is shown between hitmen killing associates and members of the rival families. As Michael's Godfather vows are being read, the murders are taking place to bridge the two ways in which Michael is becoming Godfather. The splicing of that scene marked the phenomenal transition of Michael being the family outsider, to the don of the Corleone family. A number of other scenes use juxtaposition in such a powerful way, most notably the scene in which a man is killed with the Statue of Liberty towering in the background, representing the freedom that was sought, but never obtained. Another such commanding display of juxtaposition is the joy of Christmas filling the air when Vito Corleone was stopping for fruit, only to be paraded with bullets in an attempt on his life. Later, the glistening Christmas trees lining the front of the hospital when the second attempt on his life was made. In an astounding feat, Francis Ford Coppola flanked such opposite compositions together many times throughout The Godfather, with the method never coming off as a stale or forced representation designed to manipulate the audience. In addition to the powerful scenes Francis Ford Coppola engineered using juxtaposition, he made many more standout scenes. Even though I'm vegan, THAT horse head scenes is among my favorite in cinema. That unassuming Nino Rota tone filling our ears as the camera pans the outside of the lavish home and into the bed where the horse head warning now sits is a truly brilliant example of powerful filmmaking. The tollbooth scene is another nod to the directorial aptitude of Francis Ford Coppola. Despite the fact that we have watched Sonny Corleone (James Caan) act with a quick temper and more than willing to kill any obstacle to his goals, we feel remorse for his massacre as we watch him being led to his death. There is such a bond between the Corleone's and the audience that we want to see them prevail over their troubles, despite the fact that they would be more than willing to consider us as acceptable collateral damage if we happened to walk on the wrong side of the street during one of their hits. That level of audience endearment to cold-blooded murderers proves Francis Ford Coppola's mastery at directing complex human relationships. The Godfather is, for me, the film with the best opening and closing in the history of cinema. Losing none of its steam throughout its 3-hour runtime, the opening, and closing of the film show the lengths Francis Ford Coppola traveled through his incredible telling of Mario Puzo's story. The framing from the wedding to Michael becoming the Godfather of the family is magical. The framing and use of foreground, middleground, and background of that final scene are mesmerizing and perfectly sets the tone for the continuation of Michael's story for the two sequels that follow. Multiple actors play a role in The Godfather that also serves as my personal favorite roles of theirs including James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Robert Duvall. In a film that is more tense and terrifying than my favorite horror films, The Godfather is a timeless classic that has more than earned its place on the list of best films ever made.",10,0,0,16 January 2018
