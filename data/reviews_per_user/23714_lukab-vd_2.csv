The Avengers," Marvel film that assembles Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow and The Incredible Hulk in order to stop a evil Loki who wants take over the earth.
","Thoughts- This movie is 144 minute pure gold of amazing action, Humor and emotions.This could be the best comedy of the year in my opinion.Overall, this is a big summer blockbuster, one of my favorite movie of the year and favorite movie in general. One word :Awesome !Characters- are very well developed and they are well balanced.Acting- is well done, especially RDJ as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Mark Ruffalo as the new Bruce Banner/Hulk..Rest of the cast did a good job.better then in they previous movies.Action- is ......... breathtaking and awesome !FX- are better then other marvel films. CGI is Great and believable.",10,12,24,30 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The ' Amazing' doesn't defines the movie, but Spider-Man, sure did !
","This movie did deliver lot of things to the table : great acting and action, character development, stunning special FX like as CGI but a little obvious.The movie also did leave bad things like leaving out the importing parts of the story like after Uncle Ben died, story focused on finding Bens murder rather then 'Untold Story'. Setting up the ending wasn't good enough, but the end scene was awesome ! A bit of weird things about Peter Parker, but that explains fact that he is a teenager and he has just discovered his powers.That bad things don't make movie bad and they don't hurt movie so much.Overall, This is a great summer superhero movie worth checking out !",8,1,4,12 July 2012
