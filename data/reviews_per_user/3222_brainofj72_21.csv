Mission: Impossible III," A Two-Hour Episode of Alias
","Brian De Palma's 1996 screen adaptation of the television series Mission: Impossible was pretty much perfect, in my opinion. It was a tense, intriguing action thriller that struck an impeccable balance of taut, gritty suspense and campy fun. Then, in 2000, John Woo came along and gave us a ridiculous action sequel riddled with pointless slow motion and excessive style. When I heard J.J. Abrams was going to be at the helm of the third installment, I felt a mix of curiosity, optimism, and skepticism. On the one hand, I figured he would at least get rid of that horrible slow motion action rubbish, but on the other hand, I was afraid he would forget the fun and give us a film that was too realistic and gritty. And I always doubt the ability of TV directors to make the jump to cinema. Then, as I expected, Abrams began talking about how he wanted to 'humanize' the characters. Uh oh.Then I heard Philip Seymour Hoffman was going to be portraying the villain. I didn't care about the rest anymore  that got me VERY excited.After seeing the film, I have to say that it was exactly what I expected.The plot revolves around IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Owen Davian (Hoffman), a mysterious guy with a lot of money  they never really tell us just who exactly he is. Hunt is now engaged to be married (and might I add that I found it weird that the actress portraying his fiancé bears a strange resemblance to Katie Holmes)  Abrams plot device to humanize him, of course  but IMF wants him back to rescue an agent captured by Davian. Hunt gets sucked back into the fray as Davian kidnaps his fiancé and implants an explosive charge in his head (yep, you heard me).First off, the cast is fantastic. Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames, Jonathon Rhys Meyers, Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, Simon Pegg  wonderful! And they all give good performances, especially Hoffman, who is every bit as cold and menacing as you would expect. He never fails to impress me.But, unfortunately, Abrams really doesn't deliver. As I feared, Mission: Impossible III doesn't feel like a Mission: Impossible movie, but a long episode of 'Alias'. Abrams doesn't seem to know how to use a tripod or keep the camera further than two inches away from the actors' mugs. Despite how bad it was, at least Mission: Impossible II felt like a movie. What destroys the cinematic atmosphere even further is the hiring of Michael Giacchino to compose the score. Lalo Schifrin's classic theme isn't utilized nearly enough, and all of the music inevitably sounds like it's straight out of 'Alias'. I just wasn't feeling it.Expectedly, Abrams uses a load of pointless and clichéd plot twists (which I won't go into for the sake of spoilers), but where he really fails is in the film's action. At first I thought Abrams was going for a gritty, realistic, and brutal approach, but then he throws in some superhuman jumping moments and whatnot, so then I became confused. Is this supposed to be realistic action or suspend-my-disbelief-and-have-fun action? It becomes this awkward limbo between the two, and it never really clicks.And then there is his attempt to 'humanize' the characters. I have no problem with this concept, but Mission: Impossible III is simply the wrong vehicle to convey it. This is supposed to be an action thriller, not a soap opera. Again, Mission: Impossible III feels like 'Alias' in this respect.Overall, Mission: Impossible III is a reasonably enjoyable way to kill two hours, but you could just watch the first two episodes of 'Alias' and get the same effect. I hope the next installment can get the series back to its roots. Bring back De Palma!",6,0,0,14 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Great Childhood Memory - Not a Quality Film
","Ah, Star Wars - the cinema of my childhood. I was practically raised on the original trilogy - I must have been two years old when I first watched it. Despite the fact that I obviously could not fully comprehend what I was seeing, I loved every minute of it right away. I have never stopped adoring the original trilogy - they remain some of my most beloved films to this day. I was ten years old when The Phantom Menace came out back in 1999. I was still drooling over the grand experience of the seeing the Special Edition trilogy two years prior, and I had all but worn out every copy of the trilogy I could get my hands on. I was more than ready for my next Star Wars theater experience. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. I'll never forget sitting in the theater - my stomach a black hole of anticipation - waiting for the film to begin. The 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm logos appeared - I grinned one of the biggest grins of my life. 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...' My fists were clenched. A sudden burst of John Williams' iconic score accompanied by the yellow Star Wars logo...at that point, it was safe to say it was the greatest moment of my life. For the next 2+ hours, I watched in awe, lapping up every second of Lucas' gigantic sci-fi spectacle. I was one happy kid. I left the theater in a state of bliss. My parents weren't crazy about the movie, but I managed to coax my grandpa into taking me again the next day. I sat in the back of the theater whispering every nerdy detail of the plot into his ear, still grinning with glee the whole time. Even then I was able to recognize that it was nowhere near as good as the original trilogy, but that didn't stop me from loving every second of it. The Phantom Menace was one of the defining moments of my childhood. Unfortunately, age and repeat viewings have not been too kind to Episode I. My last viewing before writing this review was the first time I had seen the film in about two years. I finally saw the flaws everyone else had been seeing. The film is far from a total failure, but it certainly is one hell of a mess. I think it would be easiest to review using pros and cons. Pros: +Liam Neeson makes for a damn good Jedi. He feels genuinely fatherly and wise. +Ray Park and Ian McDiarmid are terrific villains. +John Williams' score is as magnificent as ever. This is one I can still listen to independently. It's big, epic, and beautiful. +Lucas still does a very good job creating huge, lush worlds that truly immerse the viewer. +The lightsaber choreography is better than ever. +The pod-race scene is oh-so-much fun. +The final inter-cut action sequence of the Naboo Palace battle, the Gungans vs. the droids ground battle, the space battle above Naboo, and the Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan/Darth Maul lightsaber fight is simply drool-worthy. A fantastic scene comparable to the similarly inter-cut climactic battle sequence in Return of the Jedi. Cons: -The special effects, while great for 1999, have, like any CG effects would, dated severely over the years and many of the CG characters now look like they are straight out of Shrek. -The direction is utterly terrible. I don't know what happened to Lucas between the '70s and 1999; he proved he could direct more than competently with THX 1138 (which is a brilliant and highly underrated film), American Graffiti, and Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. For some reason, he is even worse than amateur here. Every shot feels distractingly staged, and the acting is wooden all around (and it's certainly not the fault of the fine cast). -I do not think I need to comment on the character of Jar-Jar Binks or Jake Lloyd's even-horrible-for-a-child-actor performance. -There are many attempts at childish comic relief that just feel out of place and unnecessary. Lucas even resorts to a fart joke on one occasion. -The Yoda puppet looks terrible. I cannot fathom how they were able to make him look so real in 1980, yet so fake in 1999. -Lucas seems to make a real attempt at political intrigue in this film. It's a great idea and could have been fascinating, but it is ruined by a lot of juvenile dialogue and scenarios. -There seem to be a lot of subtle(ish) racial stereotypes. I'm not sure if they were intentional or not, but they're there nonetheless. -They kill off Darth Maul, who was easily the most interesting character in the film. He had so much potential. This film is just a mangling. It was a great big screen experience, but unlike the original trilogy, it really doesn't translate well to home viewing (this isn't helped by the fact that the DVD has an awful, outdated transfer), and it certainly doesn't hold up to critical scrutiny. I'm sure I'll still watch and enjoy it from time to time, but overall this film is, for me, better looked at as a great cinematic memory and not as quality film-making.",6,0,1,23 March 2006
Fight Club," A Modern Masterpiece
","'This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.' Do you ever feel like that? Do you ever feel bored with life? Frustrated with your job and the people around you? Do you ever feel like you've wasted your precious time on this Earth? Do you ever feel like you can't feel at all? Well, 'Fight Club' is the movie for you.Many (who haven't seen the film) seem to be under the impression that 'Fight Club' is a big, dumb, brutish, excessively violent guy movie about some kind of brutal kick-boxing club. This couldn't be further from the truth.Here's the real plot: Our unnamed protagonist and narrator (Norton) is a man who hates his job and everything around him (Sound familiar?). He has a crippling case of insomnia which he can't seem to cure. He is a zero in a vast sea of electronic digits. Then he meets the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Pitt), a hip, confident funk song of a man; in other words: everything our narrator isn't. After a rather unfortunate event, he comes to live with Durden, and the two inadvertently become the founders of a club for disaffected men to take out their frustrations on each other. But eventually, Durden injects his own twisted ideals into 'fight club' and it becomes something much larger and important. It also becomes a nightmare for our protagonist. By the way, wondering why the narrator goes unnamed through the entire film? My guess would be to stress the impersonality of the modern age.At first glance, it may seem like these men hurt each other because they are nothing but raging piles testosterone with nothing better to do. While this may play a minor role in their actions, the main reason they fight is because they are victims. Victims of the age of computers, credit cards, and Starbucks. They fight because they feel nothing and they want, long, and need to feel something, anything. They relish inflicting pain. They relish receiving pain. They relish the fact that they can feel. But don't be fooled and think that this is a depressing, unrelentingly serious film about deprived individuals; 'Fight Club' is as much a comedy as a drama or a thriller. I actually found myself raucously guffawing on more than several occasions throughout the 2+ hour running time.The film is beautifully photographed and masterfully directed by David Fincher, who drenches the film in his wonderfully original and fantastically stylish approach, but the style is not a gimmick to cover up a shoddy film; it works. It works perfectly. Fincher has always had a strong visual flair, and 'Fight Club' may be his most aesthetically interesting film yet. The film also features some fantastic acting, principally from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton gives a dead-on performance as the frustrated every-man, and Pitt gives a very spirited performance as Durden, who may just be the biggest celluloid badass since Clint Eastwood's 'The Man With No Name'. Helena Bonham Carter is also notable as the only prominent female character in the film.Another strong contributing element of the movie is the fun soundtrack. The film's instrumental hip-hop/techno score, courtesy of The Dust Brothers, really enhances the experience; I can't imagine the movie without it. And as a personal plus, the film uses two of my favorite songs of all time: 'Goin' Out West' by Tom Waits and 'Where Is My Mind?' by Pixies (which are both utilized perfectly).But what is probably the most fascinating aspect of 'Fight Club' is the way it dissects the psyche of a mentally unsound individual. But you will know what I'm talking about when you see the movie, I won't spoil it for you.Also, don't be fooled by the critics who condemn the film for being overly violent and graphic. I quite simply do not understand this claim. There are a few brutal fight scenes and maybe two gun-wounds. It is not excessive or graphic. It is necessary to the plot.'Fight Club' is not about action. 'Fight Club' is not about convention. 'Fight Club' is not about brutality. 'Fight Club' is about the adverse effects of our modern dystopia. 'Fight Club' is about enlightenment. But most importantly, 'Fight Club' is about rebellious, impeccable, and thoroughly entertaining film-making. 'Fight Club' is a modern masterpiece.9.5/10",9,1,3,27 September 2005
Shaun of the Dead," A Brilliant 'Rom-Zom-Com'
","The recent surge of horror remakes has been replete with glossy, flashy movies full of generic scores mixed with meaningless nu-metal music, unoriginal story lines, carnage suitable only for cookie-cutter teen audiences, and the problem of taking themselves all too seriously. What's happened to the inventive, darkly funny horror films of yester-year, such as 'The Evil Dead' and 'Dead Alive'? Hollywood has all but forgotten what once made horror films great, but it seems that the UK is out to remind them. First with '28 Days Later', a film that put a new spin on the zombie genre, and now with 'Shaun of the Dead', a hilarious romantic zombie comedy, or 'rom-zom-com'.'Shaun of the Dead' is about, well, Shaun (Pegg), a man who is at a crossroads in his life. He works a dead-end job, he lives with his slob of a best friend, Ed (Frost), and he was just dumped by his girlfriend of three years, Liz (Ashfield). In the midst of trying to sort all of this out, a zombie epidemic just happens to break out, and this only 'exacerbates' things for him.Right from the first frame, we get the feeling that this is a thoroughly complete horror comedy, as right away it features The Goblins' score for the original 'Dawn of the Dead'. The references to classic horror films and filmmakers just flow and flow constantly, as the film gives a nod to everything from Romero's 'Dead' series (obviously) to 'The Evil Dead' to Lucio Fulci. The way the film approaches the zombie invasion is extremely clever and well-handled, featuring several brilliant sequences, one of which shows Shaun routinely walking the streets of London on a perfectly average morning and then walking them again on the morning of the undead, or, dare I say it, the 'dawn of the dead' (insert eye-roll here), without even noticing the difference. But what really makes the film outstanding is not just the horror element, but the fact that this would be a hysterical and wonderful film even without the zombie twist. The acting is excellent, especially from Simon Pegg, who delivers gags with perfect comic timing, pulls off heated confrontations expertly, and even nails the film's demanding emotional scenes, including a scene where he is forced to shoot his own zombified mother.Not only does the film keep the laughs and the inventiveness flowing, but it also delivers what so many of the sleek Hollywood horror remakes of late have been forgetting: gore. It's complete with squirting blood, gushing bites, head-shots, and even a disembowling. Also, the ending, though something of a deux es machina, is still extremely inventive and is most certainly a crowd pleaser.Edward Wright (co-writer/director) and Simon Pegg (co-writer) have delivered a film that will satisfy the demands of horror purists, romantic comedy fans, and just about every other kind of moviegoer there is (except for maybe the teens that are in love with 'The Grudge' and 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004)), for it is truly a film that doesn't forget any of the elements of a great horror movie, comedy, or drama.9/10",9,2,5,3 September 2005
My Neighbor Totoro," A Beautifully Imaginative Masterpiece
","In my mind, there are only two films that truly capture the essence of a child's imagination. One is Danny Boyle's vividly beautiful Millions, and the other is Hayao Miyazaki's sweet, tender, and utterly gorgeous My Neighbor Totoro.The story is of two young girls who move to the Japanese countryside with their father while their mother is being treated in the hospital. After settling in, these two children discover that where they live is anything but ordinary. They find a hidden path into the forest, and soon meet Totoro, a giant, furry, and lovable creature.The film is told strictly from the point of view of these two children. What adults may see as harmless and silly, the children see as amazing and very much real. When the children go on about how they can see 'Soot Gremlins' and 'Totoro', the adults simply say that they saw them when they were children as well.This formula is certainly one we've seen before, but thanks to the genius of Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro takes on a feeling of unbridled imagination never before seen on celluloid. The world he creates is an intimate yet expansive one. The fact that this is one of Miyazaki's most beautifully animated features certainly doesn't hurt this. Everything is gloriously vivid, colorful, and bursting with life.The manner in which Miyazaki presents the narrative is nothing short of brilliant. The whole time watching the film, we as an audience realize that the girls' mother is suffering from some kind of serious affliction, but this is never really addressed directly. The children don't think about it that way, so the film doesn't approach it that way. This subplot never really develops at all until a sequence near the very end of the film, and this is a very powerful sequence. In order to avoid spoilers, I won't reveal the details, but it certainly struck me with its bittersweet honesty. However, this is still a tender family film through and through, and the ending is one that is sure to bring a smile to your face. And unlike most family films, My Neighbor Totoro is sweet, but never reaches the point of being saccharine. It's an honest, beautiful masterpiece, and I give it my highest recommendation to anyone who can still manage to keep in touch with their inner child from time to time.",8,1,2,26 January 2006
Sleepy Hollow," A Darker Hollow
","Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a story that has incessantly intrigued throughout its many years of existence. How could it not? The idea of a ghostly headless horseman out to decapitate others in order to restore his own, um, shortcoming is undeniably interesting. However, many feel that Irving did not explore the dark side of this subject matter nearly enough, as he primarily focused on romance. Those who think that should not be disappointed by Tim Burton's adaptation, Sleepy Hollow.The story has been altered a little. Ichabod Crane (Depp), a young big city detective (instead of a school teacher) interested in unconventional methods, is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of beheadings that the townspeople insist were committed by a mythical murderer named the Headless Horseman.Burton, a director famous for his dark Gothic films, certainly does not stray from his signature visual formula here. Sleepy Hollow is bathed in perfectly recreated Gothic sets accented by undeniably effective bleached cinematography. This film is really quite beautiful to look at, in the manner that an ominous storm on the horizon is. Burton also injects a dark, violent edge into the story that Irving did not, and this will either please or repulse. I must admit that I was delighted to see the Headless Horseman receive the gritty treatment he deserves. He is actually portrayed by two actors in the film: Ray Park for the headless sequences and the always wonderful Christopher Walken for the scenes requiring a face. While Walken's performance is competent, I was surprised to find myself more impressed with Park. He provides the Horseman with impeccable intimidating body language and somehow manages to develop the character much more effectively than Walken, even though he never shows his face. Park has also delivered impressive performances as Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace and as Toad in X-Men. I'd love to see him tackle some bigger roles.But I digress.Though the film takes a considerably darker angle than Irving's book, there is still a romantic subplot between Crane and Katrina (Ricci), a comely young woman, that is, for the most part, enjoyable, though it does provide one of the corniest exchanges ever put on celluloid: -Katrina: Do you think me wicked? -Crane: No... but perhaps there is a little bit of witch in you, Katrina. -Katrina: Why do you say that? -Crane: Because you have bewitched me.Yeah. Ugh.Another element that tones down the dark feeling a bit is that Sleepy Hollow is a horror comedy. There are some insidiously funny moments, such as Crane's frank explanation as to why a dead body should not be repositioned at a crime scene. The film occasionally ignores basic physical laws in order to deliver a gag (for instance, Crane is sprayed in the face with blood while performing an autopsy - the body's blood would obviously not be flowing), but it's all in good fun - just don't over-think it.Johnny Depp portrays Ichabod Crane with a giddy, eccentric, nuanced, and utterly delightful glee - just further proof that he is one of the finest actors alive. Another performance that warrants mention is that of Ian McDiarmid (known to most as Senator/Supreme Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars).When I first saw the film, I gave it an A-, most likely because I was overwhelmed by how fantastic the film was visually, but upon rewatching it, I really had to demote it to a B+. Why? Well, to put it bluntly, the writing is just bad. The dialogue is really quite dreadful at times and, toward the end, the story becomes ridiculously convoluted. If a film has a basic plot as fascinating as Sleepy Hollow does, it's really not necessary to throw in a supremely confusing subplot about how the Van Whos double-crossed the Van Whats in order to exact revenge upon the Van Wheres. It just causes headaches. The film also has a pretty standard, formulaic action movie climax.But flaws aside, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, entertaining Gothic horror comedy, and fans of Burton or Depp should not be disappointed.8/10",8,1,2,28 October 2005
Crash," Heavy-Handed, Self-Righteous Garbage
","Crash. The film that confronts racism in a gut-wrenching and mature manner. The film that makes us take a harsh look at ourselves as a race. The film that is superbly crafted in every way. The film of 2004.Right? Wrong.What did I see when I watched Crash? I saw a slew of recycled racial stereotypes. I saw a sophomoric script. I saw direction on par with an episode of whatever television drama is 'in' right now. I saw the same concept of interweaving L.A. subplots that has been done so many times (and so much better) by other filmmakers. I saw one of the worst films of 2004.Crash is the story of a handful of Los Angeles residents and how their lives intertwine over a period of time. All coming from various ethnic backgrounds, these characters are confronted with intense racism both directed at and emitted from them.Having missed the film in theaters, I was inspired to view it after all of the intense debate among critics, some claiming it as an A+ masterpiece, others claiming it as F-grade garbage. I had to decide for myself. While I do not think the film is a complete failure, it certainly is nowhere near even B-grade material, let alone A.After the first ten minutes, it was already fairly apparent that this film wasn't exactly subtle. We have an altercation in a gun store as a man of middle-eastern descent attempts to purchase a firearm and is berated by the storeowner, who loudly calls him 'Osama.' We see a white cop pulling over a couple that were engaging in a sexual act while driving and feeling up the wife, and afterward, the wife screams at her husband saying that the only reason it happened was because he thought she was a white woman, and he didn't like the idea of her fellating a black man.If these blatant attempts at affecting us aren't enough, writer/director Paul Haggis also presents us with a pair of young black males. One a sensitive youth, one a rather stereotypical 'gangsta'. As they travel the sidewalks of an upper-class portion of L.A., the former explains to the latter about how all white people hate black people and how this is proved by the fact that they didn't receive as many coffee refills as other people in the restaurant they had just dined at. He spews out some more talk of how horrible it is to be black, and then they pull out pistols and steal an SUV. Wow, that's some real subtle irony right there, Haggis.Now, I realize Haggis tried to focus in on prejudiced people, but what he does in Crash is just ridiculously over-the-top. This is the twenty-first century, not 1930's Alabama, here. Is all these people ever think or talk about related to race issues? They're not exactly presented as dynamic characters. This also makes it hard to care about anyone in the film. If they're all just a bunch of degenerates, why should I care? And of course, by the end of the film, all of these characters have undergone a miraculous catharsis and have become wonderful human beings.Yeah. Sure.And again, as I stated earlier, this technique of interweaving mini-stories in Los Angeles has been far better in the past. Short Cuts, anyone? Magnolia? On top of being insultingly heavy-handed, Crash commits another celluloid sin: it's just plain easy. How hard is it to tug at the audience's heartstrings when you have a cute, innocent little girl being shot? Then all one has to do is cue up some Enya-esquire music, and voila!  you've got something the critics are guaranteed to become rabid over.Any sophomore in high school, if asked to write a story about racism, could have written a script as simple and obvious as Crash.Also, as I stated earlier, on top of having severe script problems, Haggis' direction is straight out of a television drama. It's all above-the-shoulder close-ups and shaky hand-held.However, I do not feel it is fair to give this film an F grade for two factors: the gorgeous cinematography, which results in some great visuals of Los Angeles, and the fabulous cast, which delivers some damn fine performances. Of course, they are utterly wasted on this trash.Don't be fooled by the hype, for Crash is a film that does anything but live up to it. Unless of course, you want a film in which all the intricacies of the narrative are spoon-fed to you off a silver platter. Oh wait, in order for that to be the case, the narrative has to be intricate. Nevermind.",3,9,17,25 January 2006
Corpse Bride," Don't Expect Another 'Nightmare'
","1993's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' was a milestone in cinematic history: the first full-length claymation film. And oh, what a glorious film it was! Bursting at the seems with twisted, beautiful, and vividly imaginative imagery thanks to creator Tim Burton and wonderfully catchy and quirky musical numbers thanks to composer Danny Elfman.Needless to say, Tim Burton's return to claymation was long awaited for me and many others. In 2005, it finally happened with 'Corpse Bride'. Everything I had seen in the previews looked absolutely fantastic, and I had some very high hopes for the film.The plot is as follows: Victor (Depp) is a very shy but very spirited young man living in a dreary city populated by stuck-up rich snobs who care about nothing other than money, rules, and manners. He is set up by his parents to marry a young girl named Victoria (Watson), who is, of course, the one other free spirit in the city. Due to an unfortunate series of events, Victor accidentally marries a dead bride (Bonham Carter) and is consequently sucked into the land of the dead. He then attempts to sort out this misunderstanding and get back to the world of the living.The potential is vast, but the film does little to utilize it. On top of the storyline being crazily predictable, the characters, as you can probably already tell, are paper thin and horribly clichéd. The story has some great opportunities for hilarious macabre gags, which the film obviously tries to harness, but unfortunately, they all end up being painfully corny. Also, the musical numbers, unlike in 'Nightmare', feel forced and unnecessary, as if Burton threw them in just because he felt he had to. There is just no energy or passion in them. But the biggest problem with the film is that it should clearly be a heavily aesthetic experience, and the visuals are, quite frankly, underwhelming, unlike most of Burton's previous films, which contain more than their fair share of bravura images.Also, the film seemed very short and ended very abruptly, even though it seemed to drag for the majority of the running time.The major redeeming feature of the film, however, is Burton's very interesting contrast between the land of the dead and the world of the living. The dead inhabit a fun, friendly, colorful place where song and dance are encouraged, as apposed to the living, whose world is cold, dreary, desolate, dull, and, ironically, dead. Who are the ones that are truly alive in this situation? 6/10",6,2,8,23 September 2005
The Godfather: Part II," A Perfect Continuation
","WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR PARTS I AND II.When 'The Godfather' was released in 1972, it instantly became a classic, and has now gone on to become a cinematic legend. I find it rather surprising that 'The Godfather Part II' was made at all, as 'The Godfather' is not exactly a franchise film, but what is more surprising is just how good this sequel is.'The Godfather' was the story of the Corleone crime family: Vito (Brando), the Don of the family; Michael (Pacino), his youngest son; Sonny (Caan), his hot-tempered first-born; Tom Hagen (Duvall), his adopted son and legal adviser; Fredo (Cazale), his middle child; Connie (Shire), his daughter; and Kay Adams (Keaton), Michael's girlfriend. Over the course of the film, Vito is seriously injured, causing Sonny to become Don, but due to his temper, he is promptly shot dead, thus causing Michael to take over duties as Don, and he and Kay are married.'The Godfather Part II' begins right where 'The Godfather' left off and continues chronicling the struggles of the Corleone family as they attempt to become a legitimate organization amidst the corruption they are tied to. But the film also switches back and forth between this storyline and that of young Vito (Baldini, De Niro), showing us how he rose to power.'The Godfather Part II' has about the same pace as the first film, the same beautiful gold-tinted cinematography, the same operatic approach to the subject matter, and I think it is almost on par as far as quality. But the thing that really makes 'Part II' amazing is Pacino's mesmerizing performance as Michael. He was spellbinding in Part I, as well, but this film really gives him a lot more opportunity to develop his character. The most compelling moments in the film are not the scenes of confrontation or violence, but the scenes of Pacino's intense brooding. No other actor has ever so effectively developed their character without uttering so much as a single solitary syllable. A perfect example of this is the scene where Michael and Fredo embrace after Michael had told him he never wanted to see him again. The look in Pacino's eyes is just out of this world. Actually, Cazale's performance is notable, as well.Francis Ford Coppola's direction skill is at its pinnacle with this brilliant piece of celluloid, and this, unfortunately, was to be his second to last great film (his last being 'Apocalypse Now'). Another thing that majorly contributes to not just Part II, but the entire trilogy's greatness is Nino Rota's absolutely beautiful and undeniably memorable score. Not since 1944's 'Laura' has a composer utilized a repeated theme so well.Unfortunately, the 'Godfather' series failed to become a trilogy of masterpieces when the bland Part III put a blemish on its greatness, but the sheer power and remarkable film-making of the first two chapters will be forever remembered as two of the very finest films ever made, and rightfully so.9/10",9,1,3,19 September 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Not Just Another Horror Remake
","Fresh off his visceral masterpiece Haute tension, French director Alexandre Aja gets behind the camera once more for his second film, a revamping of Wes Craven's 1977 Texas Chainsaw wanna-be The Hills Have Eyes.Upon a casual glance, it's easy to dismiss Hills as yet another useless Hollywood remake of a gritty '70s horror film  the original is indeed gritty and from the '70s. However, unlike Dawn of the Dead or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hills is a film that could actually benefit from an updating. Also, unlike the Dawn and Chainsaw remakes, Hills has a director at the helm that actually loves the genre and knows what the hell he's doing.By now, the scenario is all too familiar: an all-American family gets lost in the middle of nowhere and falls prey to some twisted clan of deranged psychopaths. Clichéd? Sure, but don't forget that the original Hills was one of the first. So just what does Aja bring to the table that sets Hills apart from the other (usually laughable) films of this type? An abundance of style, realism, emotion, and gore.Aja seems to have a very solid understanding of the most primal emotions possessed by mankind, and in Hills, he explores them in a way that most filmmakers wouldn't dare. As in Haute tension, the violence is presented in a delicate blend of realistic horror and exploitative titillation. When the family is first attacked, the violence is brutal and ugly. However, when the tables are turned a member of the family becomes the one inflicting the violence, the bloodletting is slightly heightened and exploited for entertainment. Could the protagonist be enjoying his vicious revenge? Aja portrays this masterfully and dares his audience to enjoy it with the protagonist. Just how far should one be willing to go? How far is too far? Is this just as wrong? Can it be justified? Something else atypical about Hills is that we actually care about the characters. Instead of the usual ditzy blonde teens we can't wait to see get killed off, these characters are believable and we feel for them. They are all wonderfully portrayed by the fine cast, especially Aaron Stanford (whom you may recognize from X-Men 2 and 3), who gives a surprisingly terrific performance.Something else that makes Hills more than just an average slasher flick is the masterfully subtle social commentary. The ever-present motif of the American flag (quite literally being shoved down a throat at one point)the rousing score so peculiarly similar to Ennio Morricone's distinctly (and ironically) American The Good, The Bad and The Uglythe ubiquitous desiccated desert landscape that bears a suspicious resemblance to the Middle Eastthis film has something to say.The only real flaw I can find in Hills is that there are, occasionally, a few groan-inducing 'jump scares'. They're cheap, gimmicky, and wholly unnecessary. But considering that Haute tension is pretty much entirely without such trickery, I can only guess (and hope) that they were due to studio interference. They have to at least somewhat cater to that moronic demographic, I suppose.So what's next for Aja? He says his next film, The Waiting, is going to be a gore-less ghost story. He says he wants to see if he can be scary without the gore. There you have it, folks  a man that is unafraid to unflinchingly show copious bloodshed, knows how to present subtle social commentary, and is looking to challenge himself. If the horror genre has a savior, Alexandre Aja is it.",9,0,0,1 August 2006
Jarhead," A Compelling Character Study
","First there was American Beauty, a touching comedic drama about suburban family life. Then there was Road To Perdition, a masterful Prohibition-era gangster film. And now there's Jarhead, a unique Gulf War film. I think, with his first three films, director Sam Mendes has proved not only that he is obviously one of the most versatile filmmakers around, but also one of the most talented.Jarhead is the true story of Swofford (Gyllenhaal), a US Marine who endures the hell of boot camp on the boredom of Operation Desert Storm.Jarhead takes a very unique and original approach to the war genre. In a sense, it conveys the standard 'war is hell' message, but not in the same blood-spattered manner that the likes of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down did. Instead, the Marines of Jarhead are in hell in the sense that they're bored and lonely. Swofford is afraid, but not for his life, but for what his girlfriend may be doing in his absence. These young men are raging piles of testosterone with no release. Boot camp pumped up their blood-lust to an inhuman degree, and when there are no enemies to kill, all that's left for them to do is screw around and masturbate. Masturbate a lot.Jarhead strikes me as one of the most realistic depictions of modern war ever printed on celluloid. I don't understand how so many people could be claiming that the film is so inaccurate - after all, the book it is based on was written by a Marine. There is no over-the-top action combat a la Behind Enemy Lines, nor is there constant realistic battle like in Saving Private Ryan - after all, modern warfare is not exactly going to be like World War II. There is actually hardly a single bullet fired throughout the entirety of Jarhead's running time, which is going to be the main factor in causing multitudes of people to be terribly bored with the film. Let's get one thing straight: this is NOT a film about combat. This is a compelling character study dealing with the effects of military training on the human soul.Another misconception people seem to be having is that Jarhead has a strong leftist political agenda. While it is certainly not a pro-war film, I wouldn't necessarily say it is anti-war, either. It really just shows war as it is, like Full Metal Jacket. And keep in mind, this is only through the eyes of one Marine.Though it features no actual combat, Jarhead still contains some extremely affecting scenes, and one that is actually very hard to watch, that being a scene in which a Marine sits down to watch a VHS copy of The Deer Hunter that his wife sent to him, only to find that she has spliced in footage of her having sex with another man. Watching the husband's reaction is a very difficult task. I found myself so deeply affected by this scene that I actually felt a little sick and had a hard time moving on as the film kept rolling.However, Jarhead is certainly not an unrelenting downer. There is a great deal of scathing humor, almost to the point of making the film a very dark comedy.Mendes really does show off some remarkable talent here, as he did in his two previous films. And the acting...wow, it's phenomenal. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers his most impressive performance to date, as does Peter Sarsgaard. Chris Cooper is great as always, though underused, and Jamie Foxx gives a wonderful, nuanced performance, and that's saying a lot, as up until this film I found him to be one of the most overrated actors in recent memory. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.Though I did not find the score to be particularly good, the soundtrack here is magnificent. On top of PERFECTLY utilizing Nirvana's highly underrated gem 'Something In The Way', Jarhead also features Tom Waits' 'Soldier's Things', an instrumental version of Kanye West's 'Jesus Walks', and many others.If you're looking for an action-packed war film, don't go to Jarhead. However, if you're looking for a stunningly different portrait of human beings in the military, this one's for you.8/10",8,4,9,6 November 2005
Remember the Titans," 'Cruel and Unusual Punishment' Indeed
","It is common knowledge in the film critic community that sentimentality, if used improperly, is among the most hated of all celluloid evils. 'Remember The Titans' provides a step-by-step lesson in how not to use it.The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a high school football team from the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. It is 1971, their school has just been integrated, and their beloved head coach (Patton) has been replaced with a fiery African-American named Herman Boone (Washington). The players encounter a flurry of racial problems, and Boone hauls them all away to training camp to make them become not just a perfect football team, but friends as well. The film then chronicles the Titans' perfect season as they struggle to cope with a hateful, bigoted nation.From the first to the last frame of 'Titans', the audience is bombarded with an insurmountable amount of genre clichés and cringe-inducing cheese. To give you an idea of said cheese, let me just say that I cannot count on my fingers the number of times one or more characters randomly burst into song for no reason, usually singing what is sort of the film's theme song, 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' by Diana Ross. This is meant to be heart-warming, playful, and inspiring, but it just comes off as irritating. As far as clichés...lord, where do I start? We have copious amounts of 'soulful' black characters who want to do nothing but love their 'brothers', the 'tough' controversial coach who just wants to unite the team (and his underdeveloped assistant who just acts as someone to feed him back lines so he can essentially have conversations with himself), the promising athlete who is injured just before the 'big game', the ostentatious ladies' man with a big ego, the sensitive, 'enlightened' hippie with long blonde locks (who is, of course, considered homosexual), the up-tight redneck who always hates 'c--ns' no matter what, the lovable 'Bubba', the 'cute' 'I'm nine and a half!' tomboy girl who loves football, not Barbies (complete with a foil little girl to emphasize how much she loves football and hates Barbies!), and two, count 'em, two token 'fat guys' whose purpose is to simply provide contrived comic relief, usually in the form of singing the aforementioned 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'.On top of the script being shallow, predictable, conventional, and all too sentimental, I think one of the things that bothered me the most about 'Titans' was Trevor Rabin's intrusive, grating score. It was nothing but a ubiquitous, inescapable cliché trying to tell the audience what to think. It was, to put it bluntly, insulting.The acting is capably handled by Denzel Washington and Will Patton (who are both very talented actors who consistently accept awful roles), but everyone else in this turgid mess stumbles through their bland scenes and poorly-written lines with about as much intensity as a dead turtle. The direction, delivered by Boaz Yakin (whose illustrious directing career is comprised of three other films including the fabulous 'Uptown Girls'! He also wrote such fantastic films as 'From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money', 'Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights', and, surprise, surprise, 'The Rookie', another touching Disney sports extravaganza!), is utterly pedestrian. Also, the soundtrack is comprised of '60s and '70s rock songs that are all great, but have become nothing more than mood-setting clichés (someone's been watching too much 'Forrest Gump').'Remember The Titans' also suffers from the severe detriment of taking itself too seriously. It is trying so self-consciously hard to deliver a message that it ends up doing nothing but degrading the audience's intelligence with its obvious agenda. It tries to force us to laugh, cry, and be inspired, but it only succeeds in annoying us.The only thing that saves this film from falling into the D range are its occasional entertaining moments, but they are far too little to save this twisted wreck of overused morals and tired storytelling vehicles. Denzel, please try to stay away from horrid wastes of celluloid such as this and try to star in more films like 'Training Day'. You can do better.4/10",4,7,12,29 September 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Violent Pop Culture Extravaganza
","'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is a film that's all about style. Style, violence, and pure entertainment. Some call it gratuitously violent, some call it disgusting, some call it style-over-substance...I call it magnificent.The film follows a woman known simply as The Bride (Thurman) (her real name is never revealed), an expert assassin who, while pregnant, was left for dead at her wedding by her criminal employer, Bill (Carradine), after her former, um, co-workers massacred her entire wedding party. Well, four years later she wakes up from a coma (as a situation that is as amusing as it is disgusting and brutal arises, I won't spoil it for you) and, upon discovering that she has lost her baby, becomes enraged and embarks on an epic odyssey of bloody revenge.In classic Tarantino form, the film is presented out of order, but, as always for him, it works wonderfully. 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' also exhibits another trait that is signature Tarantino: it's packed to the brim with homages. While many may complain about this and say that Tarantino is nothing but a flamboyant plagiarist, it is what he does, and he does it well. Very well.Another gripe many people seem to have with the film is that it is overly violent, repulsively so. This seems to have been a popular complaint also with Tarantino's first two films, 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction', and while I believe those two films have more of a violent reputation than actual violence, 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' really is extremely violent. However, it is not gritty or realistic violence meant to be taken seriously, but comically over-the-top violence in the style of the Kung Fu and samurai films of '70s, replete with gallons of squirting blood and plenty of flying limbs.Another pervasive complaint is that the film suffers from a severe case of style-over-substance, but, as I stated in the first sentence of this review, 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is all about style. It's what makes the film such a joy to watch. Quentin Tarantino works the camera and breezes through scenes so expertly and effortlessly that one can't help but keep their eyes glued to the screen. Also, this complaint is rendered obsolete once one has viewed the second volume of this epic saga, which really fleshes out the characters and adds meat to the bone, but I'm not reviewing that film.Another talent Tarantino has is extracting a spectacular performance from his actors, and 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is no exception. Uma Thurman is simply outstanding, especially in Volume 2, but again, I'm reviewing Volume 1. David Carradine delivers such a menacing and exuberant performance as the elusive Bill, and we never even see his face.And of course, how could I forget Quentin's marvelous dialogue? It has always been his strongest point, and 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' finds him in top pop culture form. Allow me to quote one of my favorite exchanges from the film: -O-Ren Ishii: 'You didn't really think it was going to be that easy, did you?' -The Bride: 'You know, for a second there, yeah, I kinda did.' -O-Ren Ishii: 'Silly rabbit.' -The Bride: 'Trix are for...' -The Bride and O-Ren Ishii: '...kids.' It's just so self-consciously tongue-in-cheek and joyous that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with it.All this being said, 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is not a film for everyone. If you're a fan of such films as 'Sin City', 'Ichi The Killer', or any kind of classic Kung Fu movie, then you'll most likely love this modern masterpiece, but if such films rape, kill, and then shoot your value system in the head just for good measure, than you should probably avoid this one.9/10",8,0,3,4 September 2005
The Graduate," Not Quite The Classic It's Claimed To Be
","I recently read an interview with Roger Ebert in which he was asked if there were any films he had changed his opinion on over the years. He named The Graduate as a film he didn't like nearly as much as he used to. I think that says a lot about The Graduate.It is an intentionally comedic drama about a recent college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) who returns home and sinks himself into a comfortable rut involving nightly hotel rendezvous' with an attractive older woman (Anne Bancroft), but when her daughter, who is much closer to his age, returns home, he falls for her, and a chaotic mess of twisted emotions ensues.The film plays out like a teenager's wet dream. Hoffman's character has rich parents, almost no responsibility, and nightly sex with no strings attached. But director Mike Nichols tries to present it in such a way that Hoffman's character is bored out of his mind  typical youth. This section of the film is one of the best depictions of the emptiness and anxiety of casual sex that I have ever seen. It is wonderfully heightened by the excellent accompanying Simon & Garfunkel.However, the film loses a lot of steam when the daughter enters the picture. We are supposed to believe that Hoffman's character falls in love with her, but I must admit that I felt no real connection between the characters and no real chemistry between the actors. It felt like the writer just needed to throw in something to cause some conflict in the story, so he simply threw in an underdeveloped relationship with the daughter. The whole thing seems to be a cheap attempt at depth, but it just comes off as shallow.And then we come to the film's often-parodied ending in which Hoffman's character breaks up the daughter's wedding and runs away with her. I found the whole thing to be rather underwhelming. There is no real love between these characters  they're just a couple of young people being compulsive.I also must say that I didn't think the comedy element of the film worked very well at all. It just wasn't very funny, and I don't see why it was necessary.However, the film does have strength in Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, who are both simply wonderful here. The juxtaposition of their characters alone is fascinating enough  a young, naïve man who yearns for a meaningful relationship, but can't resist his hormonal urges, and a hardened, somewhat bitter older woman who simply wants to cut out the arbitrary, for lack of a better term, bullshit and get to the carnality. But Hoffman and Bancroft inject a genuine life into these characters that no one else could have. All the Simon & Garfunkel was a big plus for me, as well.Overall, The Graduate has the potential to be an introspective drama about the emptiness of sex and the confliction of attraction, but it is squandered on a juvenile and rushed romantic twist.",6,2,4,1 August 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Brilliant Modern Romance
","Simply stated, Charlie Kaufman is one of the most talented, original presences in modern film. So far, he's delivered the strikingly innovative 'Being John Malkovich', the quirky and amusing 'Human Nature', and the vibrant masterpiece, 'Adaptation'. I find 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' to be somewhat more difficult to rate. I will tell you why later in the review.First, the story. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a man heart-broken by the loss of his eccentric girlfriend, Clementine (Winslet). He finds out she underwent a controversial new procedure (offered by a company named Lacuna, Inc.) that erases a selected memory from the human brain. Her selected memory was the long, meaningful relationship between her and Joel, which came to a bitter end. After learning this, Joel impulsively decides to have the procedure done on him. The film then shows us what goes on inside Joel's head while two young Lacuna employees (Wood, Ruffalo) carry out the procedure. Joel relives his relationship with Clementine, revealing all of their most intimate moments and quirks, and in the process, realizes how much he loves her. He then attempts to hide from the memory erasure with Clementine, burying himself in his most humiliating memories, trying to save some memory of the woman he now does not want to forget about.The film features wonderful performances from the entire cast, Carrey especially, who delivers arguably his best performance. The writing, of course, is top notch, Kaufman is a genius. The directing from former music video director Michel Gondry is teeming with life, vision, and personality. The film itself is absolutely excellent, as it perfectly portrays one of the most realistic, down-to-earth relationships ever conveyed through film, striking a delicate balance of joy and pain, revealing the couples most intimate and candid moments while never exploiting sex between the two characters.Now, here's my dilemma in rating this film. For some reason, I just don't love it like I feel I should. I don't know, for some reason it just doesn't connect with me like it does others. But this is just me personally. If I were rating this film on quality alone, I'd give it a 10/10. But since I rate films based on how much I like them, I give it an...8/10",8,1,3,27 August 2005
The Last Samurai," A Gentle Epic
","There is certainly no shortage of Hollywood epics these days, and it takes a certain flair in order for one to stand out amongst the rest. 'The Last Samurai' is a film that most certainly separates itself from the masses.The story follows American Army Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise), a man haunted by the horrors of war, as he is hired by the Japanese to train their army and lead them to victory over the Samurai, who are rebelling against the modernization of Japan. During the first battle against the Samurai, Algren is taken captive and forced to remain in an isolated Samurai village. There, he learns the enigmatic ways of the Samurai and comes to love their unique brand of civilization. He then switches sides and fights along side the Samurai and against his former peers.'The Last Samurai' is gentle, caring study of how modern society often tramples over ways of the past without even flinching. The film showcases beautiful cinematography and expert pacing. However, it is not without its flaws. The acting is hit-and-miss. Tom Cruise and Tony Goldwyn deliver average performances, while Ken Watanabe is quite exceptional as the peaceful leader of the Samurai village. The film, while excellent, also does have its share of clichés, such as a shaky slow motion scene where Algren remembers the massacre that haunts him. There are also a few moments where you have to wonder if director Edward Zwick is kind of trying to tug at your strings (to release the waterworks, that is).But flaws aside, 'The Last Samurai' is a film people should most certainly see. The social commentary is very relevant to modern society and the blend of beautiful scenic backdrops and violent battle sequences make this film truly stand out amongst a sea of stinkers such as 'Troy'.8/10",8,2,4,27 August 2005
Reservoir Dogs," World, Meet Quentin Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino is loved and hated by many, as is his debut feature, Reservoir Dogs. Like the bulk of Tarantino's work, many criticize Dogs as being pointless, excessively violent, and filled with over-the-top obscenities. I've always looked at it in a different light, as I consider it something of a The Crucible for the '90s.The Reservoir Dogs are Mr. White (Keitel), the sympathetic veteran; Mr. Orange (Roth), the young rookie; Mr. Pink (Buscemi), the squirrelly yet levelheaded one; Joe Cabot (Tierney), the tough guy boss; Nice Guy Eddie (Penn), Cabot's enterprising son; Mr. Brown (Tarantino), bit part #1; Mr. Blue (Bunker), bit part #2; and of course the infamous Mr. Blonde (Madsen), the laid-back badass. The ragtag Dogs are assembled to pull off a diamond heist, but their simple crime turns into a bloodbath, and the Dogs, one by one, regroup at a warehouse, where they hypothesize and accuse as to who among them is an undercover police informer.Right off the bat, Tarantino directs, writes, and pseudo-scores a film masterfully; not bad for a high school dropout whose resume consisted of porn theater worker and a video store clerk. His direction is fresh, gritty, and packed with homages.His writing is realism embellished with 'cool'. Considering that the Dogs are all ruthless criminals, the strong usage of expletives is perfectly feasible and never feels gimmicky. The dialogue is intense and thoroughly realistic, yet Tarantino sprinkles 'cool' throughout it, and he does it so impeccably that one hardly notices (he does this even better in his follow-up, Pulp Fiction). And by 'pseudo-scoring', I mean that Tarantino fills the film with fun, hip, energizing music, yet he did not write a note of it. A perfect example of this is the masterpiece of a scene in which Mr. Blonde tortures a young cop while the radio plays 'Stuck In The Middle With You' by Stealer's Wheel. In fact, there is no doubt that Dogs almost single-handedly revived this great song and made it a pop culture classic. The uneasy juxtaposition of brutal violence and upbeat pop music is reminiscent of Wes Craven's The Last House On The Left, only it is done infinitely better than in the aforementioned House.But what impresses me the most about Dogs is: a) Tarantino's flawless direction of his actors. The cast is literally perfect and the chemistry flows relentlessly. The emotion is raw and real, especially in the performances of: -Tim Roth: Considering that his character has a profusely bleeding bullet wound in the gut throughout most of the film, what Roth does with his role is nothing short of remarkable. Through his visceral facial expressions and perfect delivery of dialogue, the audience feels his pain. -Harvey Keitel: Keitel reveals everything that is going on inside his character's mind through his immaculate facial expressions. -Steve Buscemi: Never before and never again will audience love such a squirrelly character, and this due almost entirely to Buscemi's absolutely fantastic performance. -Michael Madsen: In his limited screen time, Madsen delivers a performance that is sinister, funny, likable, and reprehensible all at the same time. and b) The storyline. On the surface, Reservoir Dogs is a stylized gangster movie, but underneath, it is an intriguing character study and a cynical commentary on human nature. Like in Arthur Miller's The Crucible, a dangerous suspicion breaks out, and for the duration of the story, the characters are in a flurry of accusations and frustrations.As for the infamous level of violence, this Dog has more bark than its bite. It has more of a violent reputation than actual violence. Yes, an ear is cut off. Yes, a number people are shot and killed. This is nothing new or particularly shocking. Hasn't anyone seen the far more brutal GoodFellas?Tarantino has crafted a masterpiece with Reservoir Dogs, a film that entertains and distresses from the opening scene (in which Mr. Brown offers a dissection of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' and Mr. Pink explains why he does not tip) to the gut-wrenching final frame. A brilliant and remarkably impressive debut from a filmmaker who went on to greatness I need not comment on.10/10",9,1,3,14 October 2005
Signs," A 'Less Is More' Masterpiece
","When I first saw this film in 2002, it was and still remains the only movie that has ever truly scared me. Of course, my taste has changed considerably since those days, so I recently decided to revisit the film. Upon rewatching it, I've found myself more impressed than I've ever been with this masterpiece.The story follows Graham Hess (Gibson), a former reverend torn apart by the loss of his wife; his two children Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin); and his brother, Merrill (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball star. This already stressed out family is put under a considerably heavier trial when they find mysterious patterns in their crops and are then tormented by the following alien invasion of Earth.'Signs' is the perfect example of the 'less is more' approach. Director M. Night Shyamalan builds the tension so expertly throughout the film using nothing but silence and clever camera angles that by the time the climax arrives my chest is about to explode. In fact, I have never seen another film that utilizes silence and shadows so well, it's really makes the film so scary for me. Anytime we see any part of the aliens, it's always so brief or obscured that we're never really sure what it was that we just saw.However, the film does contain some rather illogical flaws. For instance, why would a baby monitor pick up a sophisticated alien transmission? Why wouldn't the aliens cut the power supply while they were invading Earth? How could they have survived even a second in Earth's moist atmosphere if water kills them? But I, for one, was too enthralled in the story to care.Another thing I greatly appreciated in 'Signs' was James Newton Howard's excellent score. It was not ubiquitous, clichÃ©, or intrusive like the identical 'original' scores in all the Hollywood fright films of late. It was there when it should have been and it wasn't when it shouldn't have been.But 'Signs' is not just a frightening sci-fi film, it also a film about faith. Graham is a man struggling with his beliefs, which leads to a rather powerful scene toward the end of the film in which he must talk his son through a violent asthma attack while exclaiming 'I hate you!' at God. Such scenes are also quite demanding from an acting standpoint, and the acting is capably handled by both of the leading men and also by the small band of supporting actors. Oh, this reminds me, keep your eyes open for a cool little cameo by Stella's Michael Showalter.On top of all this, the film also features beautiful, vivid cinematography and genuinely ingenious, fluid camera movements from Shyamalan.I guess 'Signs' is one of those 'love it or hate it' films, as I have heard lots of opinions on both sides of the spectrum and not too many in the gray area. As you have probably noticed, I am one of those who love it and I will watch and enjoy this excellent piece of cinema for years to come.9.5/10",9,1,4,1 September 2005
Sin City," A Brilliant Modern Noir
","There has certainly been no shortage of comic book movies lately. From 'Spider-Man' to 'X-Men', for one reason or another, it just seems to be the current craze. Most of the films in this group are nothing but pointless Hollywood garbage full of drawn-out action sequences and cheesy dialogue. However, there are those select few that stand out. 'Sin City' is one film does just about everything but get lost in the crowd.The film, based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, follows three stories. One is about Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a 'bum ticker' on the verge of retirement who rescues a little girl from a rapist with political ties (Stahl); one is about Marv (Rourke), an odd-looking man searching for the killer of his 'true love', Goldie (King), a prostitute who slept with him and 'was nice to him' - something no other woman had ever done; and the other is about Dwight (Owen), a man who aids a group of prostitutes in the murder of several men, one of whom turns out to be a cop, which sends Old Town (a city run by prostitutes) into a war. And this is all tied together by several elements, including a prostitute waitress (Murphy) and a cannibalistic serial killer (Wood).By now you've probably realized that 'Sin City' isn't exactly a cookie-cutter PG-13 comic book movie, due to all the prostitutes, murder, and what-not. In fact, it's a violent pop-culture celebration, featuring one of the most remarkable casts in ages and being directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Frank Miller himself.The film's visual element is undeniably fantastic, as it remains strikingly faithful to Miller's graphic novels. Using a gorgeous mix of black and white and strategically placed color, the film creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the classic noir films of the '30s and '40s while still maintaining a distinctly modern feel, and also moves at a deliberate pace, as it is loaded with snappy dialogue, clever editing, and over-the-top violence.The film's only real flaw is its hit-and-miss acting, but I guess this may have been done somewhat on purpose, perhaps to further enforce the comic book element? Maybe, but I doubt it.But that aside, 'Sin City' is a truly great, original film that screams for numerous sequels, as it seems like it just has so much more to show us. It almost feels like this film is just an appetizer. Let's hope Rodriguez doesn't destroy the sequels to this wonderful instant classic, which is arguably the best comic book-to-film adaptation ever made.9/10",9,1,3,27 August 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Disappointment
","In 2002, up-and-coming director Doug Liman offered up a thrilling adaptation of Robert Ludlum's espionage novel The Bourne Identity, and in doing so, he presented the perfect espionage thriller - great acting, a strong script, perfect direction, fitting music, and just the right touch of realistic action. After Identity proved successful at the box office, the studios decided they wanted a sequel, of course, so the next logical step was Ludlum's second novel in the series, The Bourne Supremacy. Liman had moved on to other things (Mr. and Mrs. Smith), so who was put at the helm of Supremacy? Television director Paul Greengrass. This was not a good decision.In Identity, Jason Bourne (Damon) was pulled from the ocean with two bullets in his back and was stricken with amnesia. He was chased by many killers, and eventually discovered that he was a finely-tuned CIA assassin. He managed to fall off the grid into obscurity. Supremacy picks up right where Identity left off, with Bourne in India. Now, he has been framed for a double-murder and robbery, and must come out of hiding to tie up loose ends once and for all.The film had infinite potential. Finally, someone was making a sequel to a movie worth making a sequel to. However, this project just fell into the wrong hands. Greengrass can't direct his way out of a paper bag. Nearly every single shot throughout the entire film is hand-held. It's tolerable for a while, but it eventually just becomes grating. Hasn't this guy ever heard of a tripod? But the film's failure certainly does not lie in the hands of Greengrass alone. The script is, to put it bluntly, not very good. The dialogue is often laughable, and unlike the first film, the characters occasionally just come off as stupid as they throw themselves into pointless fight/chase sequences for no apparent reason. Not at all like Identity, where every fight scene had a purpose. Also, in Identity, when there was action, it was brutal and believable. Nothing felt fantastic - it all felt very real (especially the car chase, which was just about the best since Bullitt). In Supremacy, however, everything loses the edgy feeling of a realistic spy thriller and takes on the persona of a Hollywood action flick. Every fight scene and car chase (yes, there is more than one car chase) is loaded with Michael Bay-esqe hand-held hyper-cuts. It's hard to tell what's even going on sometimes - it all just turns into a headache-inducing blur.The film is certainly not a complete failure, though. The acting from Matt Damon and Brian Cox is excellent, as usual, though the rest of the cast is sorely lacking (Joan Allen gives a forced and insipid performance). The film is also quite entertaining. And I must admit, it's still nice to have any kind of continuation to the stellar Identity, even if it's quite lackluster.I'm still holding out hope for the trilogy's closing, The Bourne Ultimatum. Let's just hope it falls into capable hands.6/10",6,1,3,27 November 2005
Evil Dead II," The Dawn of Splatstick
","Shaun of the Dead. Undead. Dead & Breakfast. Bubba Ho-Tep. Without Evil Dead II, it is more than likely that none of those films would exist. This film really did usher in a brand new form of both horror and comedy. A form that is now lovingly referred to as 'splatstick'.Before I even begin the plot summary, I will say that if you have not yet seen The Evil Dead, DO NOT watch Evil Dead II. By no means is it a stand-alone film. That said, the story is of Ash (Campbell), the hero from the first film, who, like in the first film, must do battle with evil demons summoned by the ancient 'Book of the Dead'. That's really about it.So what is it that makes Evil Dead II so special and so different from The Evil Dead? What makes it more than a cheap rehash? The answer is simple: humor. The Evil Dead was a low-budget classic of frightening, gory horror, and while there are certainly some very funny moments of extremely black humor (it somehow manages to make a man decapitating his girlfriend with a shovel seem hilarious), it was a rather intense and horrifying ride. Evil Dead II, however, is just the opposite. It has moments of frightening horror, but it is really a screwball comedy reminiscent of The Three Stooges (whom director Sam Raimi is an avid fan of). Gags include a projectile eyeball flying into someone's mouth, guffawing possessed furniture, a possessed headless corpse putting a chainsaw in its own neck, and my personal favorite, a sequence involving a possessed severed hand and a copy of Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms. Trust me, it all sounds much darker in writing than it is in the film; it's all quite light-hearted (as much as possible considering the subject matter, anyway). This type of bloody macabre humor would come to be known as 'splatstick', and would be utilized in many more films to follow.Yes, there were a few splatstick films prior to Evil Dead II (Re-Animator comes to mind), but what really sets II apart is its sheer inventiveness. Everything just feels so fresh and exciting, even today, as the film is approaching its twentieth anniversary.And of course, no review of this film would be complete without at least one reference to B-movie icon Bruce Campbell's performance, which can only be described with the word 'awesome'. He's not quite achieved the level of bada*s-ness he's at in the second Evil Dead sequel, Army of Darkness (which is in a class all its own), but he's getting there.Evil Dead II's influence is widespread and undeniable. While it is personally my least favorite of the Evil Dead series (I look to The Evil Dead for horror and Army of Darkness for comedy; II feels like a slightly diluted mix of the two), it is still a classic and essential viewing for any self-respecting horror fan.8/10",8,0,0,28 October 2005
