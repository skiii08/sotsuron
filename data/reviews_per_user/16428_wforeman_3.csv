The Blair Witch Project," wake me up when its finished
","i went into this film thinking, that the ametuer camera work would give this film a new edge, and create a scary movie. i was wrong. okay, i admitt, the way it was shot and acted did make it seem real life. but what everybody is forgetting is that real life is borring that is why films are made as they are. this film was like watching a home movie of one of your early christmases. the first ten minutes is great but after a while it becomes long winded and you start fast forwarding it to other parts.the film had a brillant idea behind it, which unfortunity did not pull off. no fault to the directors who had a great attempt. 5 out of 10",5,0,2,29 August 2000
Rules of Engagement," the trial was over too quickly...pity the film wasn't
","this film had a lot of potential but never fully got off the ground. (spoiler) the trial was over quickly which meant the conspiracy was never discovered, so the innocence of samuel l jackson was never really proven.the trial lasted a week which meant that is never created enough tension.it was a shame that the film was a bit of a flop as it did have some potential for being a good court room drama.don't waste your money on it, but if someone is paying it is definitely worth a look.",6,1,2,12 August 2000
Dumb and Dumber," THE BEST COMEDY OF ALL TIME
","this was the funniest film i have ever seen. every time i see i cry with laughter. it seems to get better the more times you see it, as more a more jokes become notisable.
i first watch it at the cinema, back in 94', and i am still watching it today. i must have seen it around 40 times...at least.
my friends get annoyed as i am allways quoting from the film..and when we watch it they can never hear the film as im quoting over it.
0ne of my favourite scenes is when jim carry is putting the vibe out at the bar. some of his expressions and movements are cryable
i don't think there will ever be another comedy that comes close....it's a shame but true.
10 out of 10 for this hit",10,0,2,18 August 2000
