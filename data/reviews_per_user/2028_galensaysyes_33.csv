The Legend of Bagger Vance," A lesson in why no one makes golf movies
","...and especially golf allegories in the Ray Bradbury mode. Golf is neither cinematic nor dramatic. Every hole the hero scores in this movie is like all the others, in spite of the same straining for suspense, the same straining for astonishment by the spectators, the same straining for uplift in the Chariots of Flashdance scoring. But what else could you do with scenes like that? I've liked most of Robert Redford's movies, loved The Horse Whisperer, but here he's back attempting to film another unfilmable book. He's also back in Milagro Beanfield country, attempting to create another legend. Legends--actual legends, as against stories-behind-the-legends--make lousy movies. Milagro Beanfield sat around for years while everybody tinkered with it, trying to make it something other than flat and slow, and succeeded only in making it flat and fast; but I rather liked it, anyway. This time Redford in the hands of Dreamworks, who never know when to stop (cf. Jan de Bont's The Haunting), and it was probably they who led him to stuff the climaxes with technical tricks that aren't really in his style and only make the movie seem more insincere. When Matt Damon is on screen, he actually performs the estimable feat of selling the story, in the same way Brad Pitt sold A River Runs through It, by playing Robert Redford; only better than he would have. Damon also seems to be playing Gatsby, and some of the sequences seem to have wandered out of that movie. Will Smith does not convince in his part, but what actor living or dead could? Jesus as a lovable and whimsical caddy who talks like Uncle Remus? Best to be polite and pretend it never happened. The other actors were fine, except for Charlize Theron, whom I found exceptionally cold and unattractive in what was obviously meant to be a warm and attractive part. Once in a while the film looks past the faces to the golf field itself, and for a few seconds gives us something to see; but it hardly pertains to the story. Redford is trying to translate the untranslatable.",2,2,3,9 June 2001
3:10 to Yuma," The first movie, messed up
","The script of this movie is a revision of the script of an earlier movie, which was adapted from an Elmore Leonard story. The first movie devoted two-thirds of its time to the original story, with embellishments, and kept perhaps two-thirds of the major incidents. In the remake both proportions are closer to one-third, and the embellishments are considerably more extensive. For one thing, the reason for the deputy's working alone has changed. In the story and the first movie, the main body of the posse traveled by a different route, to fool the outlaw's gang. In this movie, he and the rest of the posse travel together, and the second act consists of the others' being killed off one by one, as in a revenge-stalker movie, until he's the only one left: this is not an improvement.In the story, the deputy was an underpaid professional who hoped some day to make marshal. Both movies turn him into a rancher recruited out of need, but possessed of an ability rivaling that of a seasoned lawman. This makes the situation less plausible to begin with, but here he has a bad leg besides, and is still spry enough to engage in a chase-cum-gunfight rivaling the Hollywood version of the OK Corral. And further implausibilities are piled on top of these. He has a kid as a sidekick, who from a combination of motives--desire to prove himself, want of confidence in his father, and mixed disgust and admiration for the outlaw--has left home to tag along after them. Never mind that this character has 'movie' stamped all over it; more remarkable is the screenwriter's failure to see that the big conflict in the boy, his mixture of feelings toward the outlaw, should have belonged to the father; the story should have centered on the relationship between the two men. This was inadequately developed in the first movie, which in this respect was basically a morality play, with the outlaw as tempter. The midsection of the remake, detailing the posse's ill-starred journey, would have been an opportunity to deepen the interplay of the two characters, but to all intents this remains unchanged, until a series of incredible sentimental twists at the end. In addition, I didn't understand the rancher, as presented in Christian Bale's performance. This was executed in the actor's usual manner: that of a sepulchrally voiced catatonic who's fairly sinister himself. Russell Crowe also plays in a mannered style, but one suitable to the period, and is audaciously convincing until the script confounds him. Between the actors' mannerisms and those of the director, who's prone to shoot a scene any way but head on, the movie never attains the fill-your-hand-you-sonofabitch straightforwardness which a good Western requires.Once the original story kicks in, and the characters are holed up at the hotel, the movie is on more solid ground. Then it goes off on a tangent. There is a marshal with deputies, and then the robber gang, and then an announcement by the gang's lieutenant offering bounties on the lawmen, and then the townsfolk getting all het-up and running off to grab their guns. Instead of shooting the lieutenant to shut him up, the marshal listens respectfully, then shakes his head and says, it's no use, boys, we've got to surrender our weapons. This they do, whereupon they're immediately shot dead. One would suppose that the gang might think twice about this, since it robs the townsfolk of three-quarters of their promised bounties; one would also suppose that the gang would have thought twice about urging the townsfolk to arm themselves, since a few civic-minded ones, acting in concert, could take out the gang. The movie's reason for giving all those people all those guns becomes clear when the rancher begins his walk to the depot. It's so the movie can turn into a video game, with cowboys instead of zombies. Again, if several of the shooters worked in unison, the rancher would be dead immediately. But--here's the first big twist--the outlaw has come to like him so much he _helps_ him kill the townsfolk (i.e. helps himself toward prison). And then--here's another twist--the gang who initially egged on the citizens now start killing them, for shooting at the prisoner and the deputy indiscriminately. One would suppose that once they were being fired on, the townsfolk might start firing back. But no, so they all die, and so the rancher gets his man to the depot. And now guess what? The train is late! This sets up the joke that trains never run on time, but kills off the suspense generated theretofore, and the title of the movie. Suppose that in High Noon the killers decided to come later?--noon, one, two, what's it matter? There follows a gunfight. The rancher's kid unpens a cattle herd; the outlaw lieutenant falls under their hooves--that's what it looks like--but later pops up, unhurt, for the final showdown. He shoots the rancher dead, almost, but with enough life left in him for a tearful farewell to his son. On hearing this his prisoner is so moved that--last and best twist of all--he turns on his gang and shoots them all dead! And then sees himself onto the train so the rancher can share a last Little House moment with his boy: 'Did I do it, boy?' 'You did it, Paw.' etc. So the rancher dies happy--not knowing, as we do, that the prisoner's horse, just like Tom Mix's Tony, is galloping alongside the train, in position for his owner to make a flying mount and escape. (And what will he do then? Form another gang and kill them, too?)The old movie started with a title song, sung by Frankie Laine; this one would have been improved by having Russell Crowe sing it in duet with his horse as they trotted off into the sunset together. I think it would have been in keeping.",4,1,5,21 April 2008
Star Trek," Good for what it is, but missing a lot
","'Star Trek' is good for what it is, which is boys' space opera, and on that single level it satisfies the senses. J. J. Abrams is a director with the common touch, the ability to reach a mass audience without appearing to patronize it. All the same, the movie is missing a lot of things that even boys' adventure stories should have.Most obviously, it lacks a subject. The Star Trek series was always about something; this movie isn't about anything. It has no moral, no message, no point to make about human experience; and although its plot would seem to require that it show the maturation of the two main characters, Kirk and Spock, it doesn't: they remain the same at the end as at the beginning, like comic book characters. As a result, although the movie runs two and quarter hours, one leaves it with a sense of having seen less, about enough for one episode of a Saturday morning cartoon.Also, the movie has no beauty, even of the mechanized kind. A lot of techno movies, and even anime, offer alluring pictures along the way; here all the mecha and the architecture, while not particularly true to life, are more like engineering designs. The film-making is similarly workmanlike: it keeps the action going, but without grace or lyricism; it does the job, and that's all.Finally, the movie dumbs down and vulgarizes the series unnecessarily. And although Spock is pictured exactly as on the series, Kirk has been turned into a hard-drinking, hard-loving hell-raiser, who never turns into the Kirk we know and love (or tolerate). Yet, oddly for such a character, he seems to have only three acquaintances, and even the progress of his relationships with them isn't dramatized. We get only a handful of illustrative moments, one-offs, like comic book panels. The same is true of his training at the academy, and indeed of most of the other elements in the movie.The script is credited to the executive producers; Abrams can write better than this; I wonder why he didn't redo it himself.",7,2,7,1 January 2010
The 13th Warrior," Why did they bother?
","This is probably the worst would-be swashbuckler I've ever seen. It's more like a two-hour trailer than a movie. No character or scene in it is fully realized. The camera takes astonishingly little interest in any of the clothes, weapons, dwellings, ships, or other artifacts of the period, and the fights are shot so closely in as to reveal nothing. One has only to compare these evidences of inattention to the same director's treatment of modern subjects, e.g. in Predator or Die Hard, to recognize that he isn't one whose imagination extends into the past. Perhaps this is why he allows the script to be insufficiently defined as well. After a meandering start, it settles into a series of inconclusive battles and then stops arbitrarily. The story that the main character discloses in narration about how he came to be in the story in the first place is more interesting than all that follows. Would the director - or rather, a different director - had shot that instead.",2,1,3,31 August 2000
Shaun of the Dead," Self-slaughter
","Shaun of the Dead treats itself the same as the zombies it features: does itself in with a blow to the brain. For one-half to three-quarters of an hour, it's an observant and inventive comedy about a meek, clumsy loser, played and shot with much originality; so much that it sometimes skirts incomprehensibility. One can still work out what's going on; the big fault in this section of the film is the sameness of it: the jokes all have a nearly identical tone and substance; it's all really one long joke about the hero's schmoiness, and so eventually it becomes rather tiresome, in the manner of the TV series 'The Office.' It doesn't go anywhere, doesn't develop--but soon we find out the filmmakers didn't mean it to; it's all been a set-up for what they really have it in mind to bring us, which turns out to be a parody of George Romero's zombie movies. This is a letdown at first, if one was interested in seeing where the characters' lives were heading; and then it becomes a retardant: the longer it continues, the shorter a distance the script has to go and the less it has to say, until by the end it's stopped going anywhere or saying anything. A parody of the Romero movies was unnecessary; they were already parodies of themselves, and had exhausted the possible variations in zombie-bashing slapstick, by now an old and stupid trick. I'm not high on comic gore anyhow, I don't find pain and death funny; but on this occasion I especially resented its taking over: it got the movie in the head, too.",5,2,5,30 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The big conglomerates have pretty much driven the little guys out of business, you know?...Oh, the movie, right.
","Johnny Depp must work a potent magic on his admirers: by its power he's able to communicate to them, and to them alone, the character he has it in his head that he's portraying. The rest of us have to do a good deal of guessing, since the actor goes only a little way in manifesting his purpose by means of the normal external signs, e.g. facial expressions, body language, tones of voice. Lacking these to go by, I hazard that in this movie he thinks he's impersonating a would-be buccaneer who's generally too drunk, lazy, incompetent, or good-natured to carry off his boasted predations: a role for a W. C. Fields or Wallace Beery, not a performer with the look and the aura of a spoiled altar-boy twenty years past his prime. The star's deficiency might have been compensated for in some measure by intelligent casting of the leading lady; but the one we have here is Keira Knightley, doing her usual, i.e. wanly striking poses for an imaginary photo shoot. The villain, Geoffrey Rush, supplies the color and panache the other two lack; but there's not enough of him to go around. The movie is rather at pains to present itself as a piece of good fun; but for me it was a piece of hard work, all on account of the director (the same one who bumbled up the American 'Ring'). He appears to have one virtue: shooting all the script he has, so that all the pieces are there, as they often are not in films these days. But the pieces are nearly all wrong: in the staging, the perspectives and proportions are so far off what one might imagine in reading the script (or any of its published story-izings) that one almost has to revisualize the movie as it goes to get what it's about. And the script, which is a mishmash at best, is confusing in places. The first scene ends with the pirate ship bearing down on its apparent target...and then what? Pondering this enigma distracted me from subsequent developments for a good hour or so; not that they compelled much interest in themselves. I feel a gallon of ill will toward this movie: as a product for sale, which is all it is (it's a lot farther from being a work of art than the amusement ride that inspired), it's a piece of inferior merchandise, with its seams still unfinished. Yet buyers seemed not to see that. Depp's magic at work again?",2,2,4,2 July 2007
Hostel," Wayward
","Unlike most recent horror films, Hostel shows a genuine talent for scaring. But it also shows that to make the most of this the director needs guidance from somebody (probably somebody not Quentin Tarantino). In particular, this film needed a different scriptwriter (i.e. other than the director), a different cameraman, and a focus on what it was about, i.e. what kind of film it was. The idea of it would have made a very scary short story, and the film could have been as scary, whereas at present only a few scenes scare and the bulk of it is waste motion.The writing and camera-work must be discussed together because both are to blame for the insufficiency of the build-up in the first part. Even granted the director is out to establish the protagonists' lifestyle (during their vacation) as one long hedonistic binge, this needn't have taken more than a few minutes. Where we needed to get to was where they were to end up; Hostel took too long getting them there. And once they were there, it didn't do much about this. We needed to see, with them, their first look at the country, the city, the street, &c. And with them we should have seen things that unsettled us increasingly: at first the kinds of things in other cultures you disapprove of but hesitate to condemn; then things alien, partly incomprehensible; then, in systematic progression, things that were confusing, sinister, dangerous, frightening.... Almost none of this is written into the script, and where it is, the camera-work doesn't deliver it. Some movies are able to instill landscapes with a sense of dread; sometimes you know how they do it, sometimes you don't but find your stomach unaccountably in knots; either way, some such method was required here. Most obviously wanting is the atmosphere of the hostel itself, which I'd expected to be the center of horrific activity (the movie would have been scarier if it had been; but of course this has been done before). The protagonists' experiences there should have added up to more than a few conversations with the girls; they, and we, should have come to wonder about the comings and goings of the guests (especially the goings), the behavior of the staff, movements and conversations glimpsed or overheard in the hall, through the windows, at night when everyone should be in bed.... More significant is the same want of detail of life outside. We see thieving children and a torture museum; these are too obvious, and not nearly enough. We needed to see indications of a callous, brutal environment where ordinary morals are eroded and everything is a commodity, with survival the bottom line; to see enough so when we get where the film is taking us we don't doubt for a second what we see because it's a logical extension of what we've seen before; of the very _air_ in that place.Hostel's basic structure is the central horror film plot: a character happens onto a place (person, situation, &c.); at first it seems innocent, then suspect, and finally, when the character learns the truth, horrible. The basic problem with it here is the same as in almost every other film using it: it's just enough for a short subject or TV episode, and so must be stretched out to three or four times its natural length. If a film keeps to the confines of the structure, the ending is in effect no ending (that's IT?); if it goes beyond the structure into a third act, which almost has to be an account of escape or revenge, it also goes beyond the horror that is its raison d'etre; and since up to then it has been striving to convince us the horror is inexorable, in effect it's undoing what it's done (for examples of the two methods described, cf. the two versions of The Vanishing). Hostel takes the second path, but the director seems to realize he's gone beyond his original story, since he begins to exaggerate the horror and the action to Hong Kong-like proportions, dispelling the seeming seriousness with which he treated the harrowing scenes that preceded. However, in a story of this kind, any attempt at a third act is a trap, and Hostel falls into it. The script might at the beginning have introduced a larger context--war, the economy, anti-American feeling--and returned to it in the end; but that implies a more serious film than I think this one meant to be.In other respects also, the script is probably most to blame for Hostel's faults. Padded as the story was bound to be, what would have filled it out somewhat was a more rounded characterization of the protagonists. The dialogue of the villains probably needed to remain elliptical to be disquieting in the way intended; but we should have gotten well acquainted with the protagonists, seen what each did uniquely, and understood why; scenes so informing us are absent. And there are what I consider misjudgments in structure. The scenes behind the credits are disturbing, but telegraph something of where we're heading and what goes on there, both of which would have been scarier without a prior look. For a first-act payoff, the film introduces a horror shot--its first, I think--and I think this was a mistake; the shot preceding, which would have planted the same suggestion but left us unsure and worried about it, would actually have been scarier. There are two second-act payoffs: one too many. They would have been more effective combined into a single one, probably with the second preceding the first. And finally, there is some unintentional misdirection. The credit scenes mislead us, in a way; and the horror climax--the second payoff--misleads us more: it implies a third level to the system shown that would have made it even scarier (though less credible).In summary: a wayward film from a wayward talent.",6,0,0,7 April 2008
Brokeback Mountain," Desire of object obscure
","With different actors, this might have been a beautiful little film. With those present, it's likable and suggestive, but too remote from its subject. Perhaps it could have used a different director as well, because the subject appears to be outside this one's natural range.The subject (surprisingly, given the publicity that surrounded the film) is not homosexuality, in its own right, but the power of desire. The particular case shown happens to be the desire of one man for another, but it could as easily be for anyone else not allowable. The characters possessed by it seem as straight as they are queer, so that what their encounter with each other opens up may or may not be their innermost nature. In either case, and more importantly, it's the fulfillment of the strongest desire they've ever experienced or can imagine. The rest of the film traces which ways they go, and how far, under its sway.Plenty of films have shown characters throwing all away for the sake of passion. But generally their stories are presented as tragedies or comedies. This is the only one to show the series of little, everyday, foolish or wayward acts to which a man can be drawn by the irresistibly compelling, almost besotting force of a temptation. The excitement it introduces into his mind, crowding everything else into a corner; his fear and longing for it, which throw him into a kind of fog through which everything else looks vague and far away; his shunting aside of family, friends, job, all the obligations that seemed important before now dropped while he runs after his desire; the fabricating of stories to explain where he's off to, and the excuses he makes to himself; his feeling sorry afterwards, and even while he's doing it--but then, not truly.... At some time nearly everyone goes through something like this, or consciously resists it. The case shown is of a man wanting another man, but the condition is universal.The film observes it with great sympathy and accuracy of detail. It traces all the big steps in the characters' lives of desire: the preoccupation, concealments, getaways, and so forth. These, rather than the strict time sequence, are the basis of the chronology. And so perhaps they should be. But this structure leads to some jarring rifts in the straight timeline. For instance, one of the characters meets a woman, and a scene or two later she's bearing his child. I accepted these jumps to an extent, as approximations of the characters' own perceptions of their lives, but they tended to throw me out of the film and ought to have been managed more adroitly.I've read complaints that the film is slow. So it is, compared to films set in big cities. But it proceeds at the tempo of the Western towns where it's set and of the Westerners who live in them. If they moved faster, their actions would not only be unlifelike but would be robbed of their meaning.Where the film falls shorter is in the leading performances. The two actors are agreeable, but not good enough for their roles (or the roles weren't right for them). To be sure, the script doesn't give these enough definition, but the actors don't fill in the spaces. And they don't seem quite right otherwise. They don't seem of the place or of the period; in their scenes together, they don't seem to know each other or to be with each other. (In scenes with some other characters, they do.) Most crucially, they don't communicate any desire for each other, which is what the story turns on. In their sexual scenes, one has to infer this. And the action itself (as usual in sexual scenes) tells almost nothing about them.Perhaps the director or the screenwriters did intend the film to be about homosexuality. The last reel, approximately, so suggests. It takes a different, more sentimental direction than expected (I wonder if this was added on to the original short story). A more logical close might have been for one partner to lose his desire, or to feel it swamping him so much he had to give it up. The film's close isn't about desire at all; it's about love. To be sure, there's a relation between the two, but the film doesn't make clear what it is, or how we got to one from the other, so that the new facts we learn about the characters in this section feel like footnotes.The town settings at the beginning are almost painfully authentic in their quietness, the sharp sunlight, the cold heat of the air and the sun. I only stopped believing when the actors stepped in.The mountain is never as real as the town. Probably that's because its meanings are never communicated in visual terms. The narrative meaning is probably a literary one that no actual place could measure up to; the emotional meaning could be caught, but only with effort. It would have to grow out of the characters' everyday interactions with the place, first in their work and then, gradually, in their personal relations. But the details of these are scamped, so that we only glimpse, but never feel, the atmosphere unique to the place: the bite of the wind, the hardness of the ground, the steepness of the climb to the grazing field, the denseness of the herd; then, the relative comforts of the camp and, even more, the tent; and finally, the releasing of an urge that's been straining at its cinches, and the association of that freedom with the place where it happened. Some films achieve that kind of identification of landscape with interior feeling.But first must come the feeling.",7,1,8,14 November 2008
Match Point," Bad girl in sooth
","This movie presents Scarlett Johanssen as a sultry femme fatale; and there's the rub. To me she looks like an open-mouthed Valley girl whom I'd expect to see working in the food court at the mall...except that those girls generally have more passion, and are more attractive. Judging by the reviews she gets, Johanssen sends a lot of middle-aged men into a tailspin, and I imagine that's how she wins a role like this--and indeed, tends to behave very much like a young actress working hard at doing so by wrapping a middle-aged producer around her nubile finger. But she is no vamp, and here, she's hardly an actress; her inexpressiveness of face, voice, and body makes a big hole at the center of a production that is half-baked at best: the characters and dialogue are in some early-draft stage, and the direction goes no farther in realizing them. And so were they in the only other late film of Woody Allen's that I've seen; he now seems to write and direct as Jack Nicholson now seems to act, content with work that is characteristic enough for the body of fans to recognize it as 'so Woody' ('so Jack'), and to assume its merit as thereby proved. The only definite achievement of this film is to show Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in a persona other than that which he brought to his first movies--that of the Antichrist--in every case more or less inappropriately; so he may turn out to be good for something, after all.",3,2,3,10 June 2007
Silent Hill," Director swallows game, drops turd
","Stupidly violent; and apart from that, stupidly senseless; and then, as it wears on, stupidly pretentious in a garblemouthed, muddleheaded way. Or, in other words, like a video game. It's presumably made for gamers who get off on watching a child tortured and burned black, and then still living and still suffering: gamers who in watching her feel no pity or sorrow but think only: Wow, how cool. No wonder parents are down on these things. This movieization of one of them has a single virtue: an eerie setting, or sequence of settings. But it's used by the director to show off how slick he is rather than to involve us, so that we never get a sense of being with the character, or of feeling with her, as she does what she does--which is to perform childishly repetitive actions such as running through street after street and building after building, meeting horror after horror and discovering the occasional clue or object that allows her to go on, all without rhyme or reason. Or, in other words, like a video game. The actors are all pretty stiff, except for Alice Krige (who's certainly come down in the world since Chariots of Fire). But then the script was impossible to begin with, a product of the kind of mindless, heartless inexperience that is normally available only to children and the incurably childish. After this movie I'm prone to concur with Krige's character: a great big purge of the vicious may be just what this culture could do with, right about now.",1,4,9,19 September 2007
Knocked Up," Not a comedy
","This isn't a comedy; it just plays one on TV. A comedy requires a comic premise, comic scenes, and comic characters, all of which the movie lacks. It's a straight romantic drama that dresses like a comedy because it's too cowardly to present itself seriously, maybe realizing that if it did so, its shallowness would become obvious and offensive. Men are adolescent jackasses, women are snotty bitches: that's the extent of its perception. I've always been a fan of Katherine Heigl's, but in this role, every time she tried to show a liking for anyone or anything, she came across to me as cold and false. What I thought I was really reading in her look and manner was a general sense of distaste and unease for the situation she found herself in; I suspect the feelings may have been her own and not the character's. Which would be natural enough in the circumstances.",3,3,6,14 September 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Latter-day thoughts: On the one hand...but, on the other hand...
","I recently watched the LOTR films consecutively for the first time, and at the same time began re-reading the books. Having experienced the films together as a single work, I now believe I was wrong to label the first two films good and the third bad. What's wrong with them is wrong all the way through, from the first one on, and only becomes more obvious in the third. It's true that Fellowship entertained me more than the others, and that The Two Towers satisfied me more completely, in being more of a piece. But I now think that what pleased me in them was the obverse of what was lacking. And so every time I see Fellowship it palls on me before the end, and Towers hardly seems worth re-seeing.For me to criticize this first film unfavorably feels unfair, because in doing so I seem to be discounting the real pleasure it gave me. Seeing the places and incidents and characters from the books more or less faithfully reproduced up there on screen for the first time produced a series of little explosions of wonder and delight. They were fewer in Two Towers, and absent altogether from Return of the King. In part, this was to be expected--one can't have the same experience three times--but it was also because those momentary delights, in order to amount to something in the end, would, as they subsided, have had gradually to reveal a continuous and coherent narrative and drama underneath. This is what was lacking, and nowhere more than in this first and most entertaining film.As a basis for adaptation LOTR most nearly resembles Gone with the Wind, another long novel set in a world which the author has inhabited in imagination for so long that it has taken on a reality of its own. The difference between the two works is this: Gone with the Wind would have made a good film no matter in what period it had been produced, because it has colorful, dynamic characters and strongly dramatic scenes, and LOTR does not. It has all the other makings of a good film (probably not three), but not those. An able screenwriter could have made it into a good script, but would have needed the acuity to know which ingredients to cull from the books and the skill to transform them. An opening example: the first two facts we learn about Frodo in the books are that he likes to wander the woods of the Shire, and that on observing his uncle Bilbo's odd behavior at his farewell dinner he becomes worried for him. Neither of these characteristics fits with the Frodo of the films.Frodo is not a very deeply drawn character, in conventional terms. Most of what there is to be learned of him must be gleaned indirectly from incidental observations, from the words and rhythms of the language that describes him. More can be gleaned from his occasional exercises of will, such as the decision that sets the story going: his volunteering, before the assembled council, to take the Ring. This scene can serve as an example of how the films fall short of the books.In re-viewing Fellowship, almost the first thing that struck me was that this act seemed completely unmotivated, though it hadn't in the book; and in re-reading the book, it still didn't. So I went back to it to see why.In principle Frodo has made this decision long before, almost accidentally, after learning the Ring's history. Gandalf says, 'If you want to destroy the Ring--' which seems just a manner of speaking, but Frodo answers, in more or less these words, 'I do want to destroy it!...or, well, I want to see it destroyed.' He has committed himself almost without knowing it. When he leaves the Shire it is with this purpose in mind, though he has no idea how it is to be realized. When he adds to his declaration, '...though I do not know the way,' he's only re-stating what his position has been all along. In addition, before he makes his offer Bilbo has done the same, and after he's turned down someone else asks, in so many words, 'Then who is it to be?' Verbally, Tolkien leads the scene to a point where it can only be Frodo who responds, and the reader hopes and knows he will rise to the occasion. Tolkien has planted the clues, or cues, so cunningly that the reader has to search for them. In scripting the film, Jackson failed to note them or, where they couldn't be communicated cinematically, to supply substitutes.And with rare exceptions, this remains the case throughout his trilogy.",7,0,2,29 January 2007
The White Ribbon," Going scourging
","I'm either too guilty or not guilty enough to accept this movie. At bottom it's just another of those suspense stories that amount to a half-hour TV episode--specifically, an episode of the old Alfred Hitchcock series--padded out to five times the length; but this one differs from the rest in its aesthetic and social pretensions. Quite evidently, the director set out to make an art film and a political parable, and prepared himself by watching a lot of early Bergman and late Carl Dreyer, and probably Bela Tarr, as well as art horror movies. And so the movie is shot in black and white, in formal, frozen compositions that last forever; it takes place in an isolated, almost medieval village, where everybody looks as if they were in mourning; and the whole story is narrated offscreen in a muted voice. All this seems like much ado about nothing, since the moral of the fable becomes obvious at once and that is the point of the exercise, as well as the sole source of dramatic interest. Having gotten the point already, and not feeling the need to undergo ritual purification, I found the movie a reverse luxury: something I could have afforded but didn't want. Those who have ears to be boxed, let them hear.",4,6,16,14 November 2010
Spider-Man," The preview was better
","...and so were the book, the strip, the TV series, and the Saturday morning cartoon. The film must have cost a big fat bundle, but it feels like TV, and everything in it has been done better on TV, as well as in other movies. What was effective in the preview--the one-liners, Kirsten Dunst's delight at being rescued, the exhilaration of the web swinging--falls flat in context because it is inadequately prepared for and because whoever made the preview didn't make the movie. For instance, when Peter is testing out his powers, the big swing across town comes too soon and too easy. Here, and in the other dramatic progressions, big and necessary steps are missing. The actors are miscast, as compared to the comic book or to the script. In addition, they are ill-matched, except for Willem Dafoe and the Ethan Hawke clone playing his son. Dunst doesn't seem like Maguire's lifelong neighbor or his girlfriend (too old, too self-centered, from a different world), Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris don't seem like his uncle and aunt, or like husband and wife, and so on. It would be difficult, I think, to match Tobey Maguire with any actor. Even so, he and Dafoe do very entertaining work, given that they're doing solos and they perforce miss certain notes outside their ranges. But between them they carry the movie. My biggest disappointment was in the lack of the surge I had hoped for from Spider Man's flights through the city. I only felt it in the last scene (which I'm pretty sure was given away in the preview); in most of the others the movements are too fast or too dark to be clearly made out, and when they can be, the super-characters often look like computer cartoons, which indeed they are. I suppose the reason their masks are stiff and inexpressive is to enable the actors to be matched more easily with the cartoons, but it weakens the dramatic scenes; we might as well be watching the cartoons. The heavies--Dafoe in his Green Goblin activities (which owe a lot to the Wicked Witch of the West) and Jonah Jameson--are too silly and irritating to be taken seriously. Most of all, the numerous rescues convey no sense of danger or relief, no joy in deliverance or gratitude for the coming of a deliverer, no reason to cheer the hero.Maybe '2' will be better.",3,0,0,17 May 2002
Quantum of Solace," Exciting and beautiful
","Quantum of Solace would be the best James Bond film ever made, if it weren't for Casino Royale; and its first ten minutes may be even better. It's always intriguing, and often exciting or beautiful. Its main task is to confirm the direction the new series will take now that it's standing on its own two feet, without Fleming's novels for support. The new approach, as Casino Royale indicated, is more in keeping with the times, both in its realism, where it's realistic, and in its stylishness, where it isn't.A big part of the new approach, it appears, is to allow Daniel Craig as Bond,to relax more into the role instead of always showing his pulp-fiction aspect; and the same for Judi Dench as M. We even get to see M doing her toilet at her dressing table. I question whether this idea worked. To me it looked as if both actors were out of character much of the time; but perhaps they weren't, perhaps the characters had been deliberately softened. Anyhow, their less spylike, more conversational attitude sometimes makes the film seem more like TV: like a terrific episode of The Saint.What lifts it above the TV level, besides the budget, is a series of fight scenes, chase scenes, and spy scenes (notably, in the last category, a surveillance at an outdoor opera house) that are put together in ways I never saw before. In fact, sometimes the cutting is so fast, and the angles so oblique, that I didn't quite get what happened. Also, the film has an eye for the Bond character like no film preceding, and paints some archetypal images of him as he's never been shown: for example, in his moments of stillness at the ends of fights or chases. Some of these images could be framed and hung in a gallery.Casino Royale showed Bond as a man who moves from start to finish line in the swiftest possible fashion, parkour-style; Quantum expands on that to show him as one to whom no way or means to it is barred. The handiest door, path, or vehicle, he takes as his right, and as a matter of course, jumping from one to another without a second's hesitation--and the means sometimes appearing to hand with a readiness that defies probability. The earlier films pictured him doing the same, but not so wholly from his point of view. Sequences in this film make us know how it would feel to be always on the move, with no barriers to stop us; to be able to pass from one realm of action to another totally incongruous with it--from back-alley fight to fancy-dress party--and never turn a hair.The film's plot is a very good plot, for Bond. But it's too slight for the film's full length: it lacks the scope and the basic appeal of the plots of Fleming's novels. And the point of it is never made clear in the dialogue (or if it is, I missed it). Bond goes looking for something, and he finds it, but not in the way he'd expected; that was then, this is now; he's already moved on; that's what he does. It's all clear enough in retrospect, but I didn't get it while I was watching, and had to work it out afterwards.The supporting cast is excellent. The villain lacks the flamboyance of Fleming's villains, but is deliciously loathsome in his own right. The Bond girls are both engaging and challenging. Giancarlo Giannini, returning as Bond's ambiguous ally, is an actor who grounds any scene he appears in, as is Craig; they're perfectly matched.While I was watching the film, I simply enjoyed it, and thought that was the end of the matter. But after I left the theater, I found my view of things transformed. The car was a glamorous weapon; driving was a thrill. I took a wrong turn onto an alley that ran behind a row of machine shops; one of the metal doors was standing open, and it looked like it gave onto a secret spy headquarters; across the alley a man in a parked car was glaring at me--was he a Bolivian agent? The alley suddenly turned into an unpaved stretch of mud, booby-trapped with potholes, and bending around out of sight; I wanted to take it at top speed, as far as it led, and crash through whatever barricade might rear up at the end. For a little while, life was an adventure.You can't ask more from a movie than that.Note: A number of reviewers have made a point of observing that this is the first Bond film to be a sequel; but technically, that isn't quite true. In From Russia with Love, the villains were out to get Bond for having killed Dr. No. In Diamonds Are Forever, Bond killed Blofeld (as he thought) for having killed his wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There are probably other instances.",8,2,7,28 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Cool and smart, but not in a good way
","Cool and smart, but not in a good wayThe setting, or range of settings, in No Country for Old Men--the chilly, dry, silent southwestern desert--is wonderfully chosen and perfectly photographed. I'd always wanted to see it used in a movie, and pictured in just this way. I'd found it in fiction occasionally, e.g. in the Lew Archer novels, but not on film, that I can remember. And the story of this movie suits it: a story about a crook, a semi-crook, and a lawman driving across the miles of highways and desertscapes in pursuit of one another. I also can't remember another movie that points up the amount of long and tedious driving it takes to follow somebody.But with all that, the feeling of the place is missed. The vast spaces are shown, but not how they strike the eye if you're staring across them; the light is caught exactly, but not how it hits the eye if you're using it to see by. The soul-replenishing, or soul-eroding, atmosphere--the chill, the dryness you feel in your throat, the lonely silences--never comes across on film. It's a place where you can hear your own breath, hear the motor of a distant car, see its headlights on the horizon, and wonder uneasily what it's doing out on the road at that time of night; a figure distantly silhouetted against that background takes on a crisp-edged ominousness. This movie pictures the figures, the edges, and the background, but doesn't convey the threat: not even when a murderer is looming up behind an unsuspecting victim.Why not? I think, for one reason, because the people in this movie, and the tools of harm they carry with them, have a way of arranging themselves into formal, academic compositions. The men move, rather than being moved; deliberately and without urgency, and with no deep-felt needs driving them: even a greedy man willing to be shot for some hidden money, even a man who has been shot and is begging for water. The movie is more conscious of its own wishes than those of its characters. Indeed, I'd say self-consciousness is its most distinguishing quality. A writer on writing once advised that if a sentence seems unusually good to the author, he should remove it, because it's sure to be too clever and to call undue attention to itself. The same is true of movie-making. The characters in this movie are so busy moving into the right configuration for the shots that they never have a chance to stretch their legs; the movie is so busy being like a movie that it never has a chance to be born. Like several other recent Best Picture winners and nominees, it's an exercise to please the filmmakers more than a performance to entertain an audience.I had trouble following it. I kept losing the thread, was never sure how the characters found the people they were looking for. Either that was not explained, or it was simply not interesting enough: not only because the characters' actions had no driving force behind them (in addition to being carried out at one-third the speed that might have held the attention) but also because the characters themselves--the main ones, at least--were blanks.In this respect the movie reminded me of Wim Wenders's road pictures, where the subsidiary characters (usually women) whom the heroes meet and discard along the way are invariably more lively than the heroes themselves. The people in this movie who piqued my interest were the nobodies, such as the owner of the gas station and the manager of the trailer park. I'd rather have stayed with them, and watched them puttering around in their offices doing nothing in particular, than returned to the main action, because those people had lives, they were about something--something trivial, perhaps, but something. The men at the center of the movie seemed to be about nothing, even when killing or keeping from being killed. To me they were ciphers.So the movie reminded me of something else as well: the presidential contest that followed shortly after, if it wasn't going on at the time. Here was contest between two men both of whose identities were mysterious; I had some idea of where they'd come from, but no idea where they were going: just like the men in this movie. And most observers didn't seem concerned to ask; seemed content to leave them to it and continue to observe, dispassionately and at a distance: just like the movie makers. So maybe they're on to a real trend in our society, after all. The one movie of theirs I've liked was O Brother Where Art Thou? In that I thought I saw a genuine affection for the period, the place, and, above all, the music being depicted. I haven't seen all their other work, but what I've seen has put me off. It has all seemed too cool and too smart, as though always on the verge of a smirk. That's an attitude I don't take to, on screen any more than in life.",6,2,5,31 October 2008
Twilight," Where were the grups?
","The first impression this movie left was that it was a cheap, third-rate movie, with a director and actors of the calibre one would expect at that level. Then I learned that the same director had done 'The Nativity Story,' which I thought a beautiful film, and that the actor playing the lead vampire had played a good part in the Harry Potter movies, where he showed at least as much of elegance and charm as that series required. And from a chance shot in a featurette on the DVD, I got a breathtaking view of the Washington forests which reminded me of how gorgeous they are. Their power never comes across in the movie; the lead vampire seems ugly and tacky; the direction, bumbling and limp. Clearly, something went wrong.Whatever it was, it's evident from the very start. The first thing we hear is a girl's monologue about the coolness of dying, or something to that effect, and the first thing we see is...a fawn's behind. Why? Is the fawn's butt talking to us? Is the fawn a symbol of death? I guess not, because it scampers away. It doesn't like to hear stuff about death? This kind of unwitting comedy recurs throughout the movie. Everyone involved with it seems to have lost her capacity for detecting the absurd. For instance, take a look at the lead vampire's expressions when he's seized with a sudden attack of bloodlust. It looks like he has to puke. Or look at the scene where he sucks on his girlfriend to save her life and his 'dad' tries to get him to stop but he can't because he likes sucking too much. This is a set-up for a 'Seinfeld' scene; imagine George at the girl's throat.As the story develops, it started to seem awfully familiar--and I realized I was watching a WB show from the 90s (for an audience who's probably too young to remember what the WB was). More specifically, I'm watching 'Roswell,' with vampires--and worse actors. The kids who are 'different,' the boy saving the girl's life and revealing his powers in doing so, the others blaming him for putting them all at risk, etc. And with the resemblance, you see how poorly developed this situation is by comparison. For instance, in 'Roswell' an evil alien was committing murders that incriminated the good ones; and so in this one with a trio of evil vampires. But in 'Roswell' the sheriff believed in aliens and had his suspicions of the kids already, so was ready to attribute the crimes to them. In this movie, that possibility is very remote. First the sheriff would have to believe that there are vampires, then that the kids are vampires, then that they did the crimes.... The suspense is nil.Of course the movie also swipes from 'Buffy,' 'Angel,' and all the other good-bad vampire sagas. But in this movie the good vampires are only good, which eliminates one of the three main reasons we'd be interested in them, and also keeps them from being scary--eliminating the second reason. And finally--the third reason--they're not sexy. Partly this is because they're given unattractively pasty make-ups--and not very attractive make-ups generally--but partly it's because the actors aren't sexy to begin with. And neither is the human heroine, so that the teen lovers (which is to say, movie-teen/non-teen teens) are the most sterile, sexless pair since Frankie and Annette.And they're hardly vampire-like. Got no fangs, don't avoid sunlight--don't believe crucifixes were ever deployed, this is an agnostic movie. And the powers the vampires do exhibit (super-speed, super-tree-climbing) seem more appropriate to super-werewolves, or super-were-monkeys.All in all, the director appears to have lost focus on the material. But how? Another featurette on the DVD shows the director, the writer of the 'novels,' and several cast members as guests at a comics convention. As each steps on stage, the audience emits a mass squeal. They do the same thing every time one of the guests opens his mouth to answer a question. An audience of little girls, by the sound of it--but in fact interviews show that several were teens or grown women, behaving like little girls.I think the same thing happened to the film's makers. In the featurette, the director tells how she loved the books and is really excited to be bringing the characters to life on screen. The screenwriter says much the same. The author tells how she's really excited to see the characters come to life. None of them says, 'Omigod!' or, 'Robert is, like, so cute!' but their commentary isn't far above that level. It appears their enthusiasm for the books, and thence the movie--that is, their own work--reduced them to fans of themselves and deprived them of the capacity for mature judgment.So 'Twilight' is like a movie made by a little girl. The daddy is a big stiff stern man who loves her but doesn't show it. The mommy is a wide-eyed sap who loves her and shows it, but is silly. Also, she's not around, the little girl has to talk to her on cell phone because Mommy left (this is a movie for little girls of divorced parents). The love scenes are sexless because that's how a little girl would imagine them. The vampires aren't creepy because that would be gross. The heroine doesn't have habits like smoking or drinking because those are yucky. And she's the center of everyone's universe, everyone bends over backwards to make her happy, she doesn't have to do anything for herself--and she deserves it. The perfect little-girl fantasy.The movie needed a grown-up in charge.",4,2,5,17 May 2009
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I don't get it (spoiler)
","To prepare for seeing this I watched a battery of Hong Kong movies, including three dozen flying-swordfight movies, to enable me to put it into perspective. The upshot was, I became a fan of Hong Kong movies, but didn't like this one at all. The only pleasure it gave me was to watch the younger woman in her fight scenes--what the movie let me see of them. She's so stylish and intense that alone of the stars she's able from time to time to struggle out of the blanket of dullness that smothers everything else. This must be one of the most uncinematic tellings of a story in the history of movies. Without the sound or the subtitles, you couldn't follow the plot at all.Actually I didn't understand it even with the titles. The most I could get was that it centers on a pair of ex-swords-for-hire, male and female, who have been sniffing around each other for years but are both too shy to make anything of it, like the neighbors in 'The Cherry Orchard.' Their retirement is accidentally ended by their constant run-ins with an insufferable girl who wants to be a fighter like them but keeps getting into trouble from which they have to bail her out. Her potential has been misdirected by her secret master (female master: mistress?), an enemy of good guys in general and the male s-f-h in particular. In the final rescue, he and his opposite number finally declare their love, but too late, and the girl, realizing at last the sorrow of it all,............does what? Kill herself? Accept her fate? Fly away? It doesn't matter much which, and the same is true of almost every act in the movie. Who are these people? What are they doing? Why should we care?",4,0,2,7 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Bad director, good movie
","Peter Jackson hasn't the first idea--or perhaps has only the first idea--of how to tell a story in a movie. A character points to a ringwraith and says, 'Look, a ringwraith!'; cut to the ringwraith. In general, that's the extent of Jackson's skill in visual narrative. Also, lacking a sense of story, he lacks a sense of myth, which is one of the two things that Lord of the Rings is. (The other is invented history, which he does get.) Jackson is an enthusiastic but unbridled filmmaker. Sometimes his shots cut together, sometimes not, and have to be glued together with loud music; sometimes his scenes are modulated in proportion to the whole, sometimes not, but you don't notice for all the noise. However, out of an obvious affection for the books, a sense of drama and epic, a goodish script, a mostly good cast, a good crew, a bunch of computer equipment, and all the money in the world, he has managed to cobble together a pair (so far) of classic fantasies, according to movie standards. They would be better viewed in half-hour installments, and, their huge lush landscapes notwithstanding, could do with a lot more fresh air. But they're as good as--and better than--one could sensibly expect.The second film improves on the first--slows up a bit, steers away from the faux 3-D effects, and allows space for some finer and subtler things to emerge: splendid performances in the roles of Eowyn and Faramir, a depth of feeling in the characterization of Gollum, and moments of real visual poetry. But strangely, it's much less like the book, despite its fidelity to details of name and incident and setting. However, the most obvious ways in which Two Towers departs from the book were apparent in Fellowship, too. The books are all story and no drama; the films are just the opposite. The books leave an impression of clearness: clear air, clear water, clear thought; the films are filled with drive, grit, and ceaseless motion--rather like the factory of Isengard, and most unlike the cloister of Lorien. But I'll probably go to see this one a third time, anyway.",8,0,1,24 January 2003
I Am Legend," Grrr, arrrgh
","The company that made the TV series Buffy was named Mutant Enemy, and its logo showed a cartoon cut-out of a bald monster with outstretched arms bobbing through the frame while an offscreen voice says, 'Grrr, arrrgh.' That's more or less what the monsters in this movie amount to.And facing off against them is another TV cartoon, Fresh Prince: no longer so fresh, but exuding the same air of affable cheekiness, now ambling through the apocalypse with only his trusty dog as companion. (Note to screenwriters: As a device for allowing a character to confide his thoughts, a dog is just one step up from a sock puppet.) This is the third movie of Richard Matheson's book. It must be much the most expensive (the star's salary probably exceeds the budgets of the other two movies combined), and much the best-looking. It's also much the worst, because it leaves out the reason for the story. The story is a suspense story; the movie leaves out the suspense.The book was based on one simple idea: the last surviving human shares a ruined city with a band of vampires; during the day he hunts them, and at night they hunt him. Every sunset is a source of dread; every sunrise is a relief. You feel the suspense of the situation just hearing about it. The first two movies got that. I would have imagined it impossible to make a movie of the book and not get that. Yet here's one that manages not to.It opens well, at first sight. It begins with a TV interview of a great biologist and humanitarian (well played by Emma Thompson), discoverer of the miracle cure that will save us all. Cut from her glowing optimism to the desolate streets that were her ultimate legacy.And amid the desolation, who do we find? No legend (except of the box-office kind): big Hollywood star Fresh Prince-Bagger Vance-Hitch, former rag doll now become bendable action figure, as likable and unreal as ever. He's like a big kid, and the director is clearly a kid at heart, so that between them they vividly transmit how it would feel to have a great golden-hued city all to yourself (or nearly): like having the world as your playground.These opening scenes are great to watch.The trouble is, they're all wrong for this movie.The interview that shows the seed of the crisis would have been a good start for a science fiction story like Day of the Triffids (the TV serial of which actually had an equivalent scene); it does nothing toward introducing a horror story about a man playing cat-and-mouse with vampires--or, as here, mutants.And then, the opening scene shouldn't be sketching out a character who isn't part of the story but the character who is, the one we should care about.And then, the city shouldn't seem like a theme park but a real place, with real menace in its streets.And then, those opening scenes shouldn't exist simply for their own sake but should be unobtrusively laying the groundwork for what is to come, so that it appears to happen of its own accord.The movie gives no sense of scope. No sense of the passage of time; of the contrast between what was and what is; of the devolution of humankind. It doesn't even give a sense of the points of the first interest in any story about a lone survivor: how does he survive? how does he stay sane? what is life like for him day by day? Again, the first two movies got that. Although both were poorly staged, they were right in essence: stark, grim, and slightly seedy. And their leading actors were well chosen. Vincent Price shared in the seediness himself, Charlton Heston acted like a cop on a beat who was used to it. A certain distaste for the people (or other species) around them, which is almost an essential for this story, fell squarely in the middle of the actors' ranges. Not so Smith's. He's still the Magical ******, stepping in at the moment of crisis to disclose the authentic swing. He even manages it here, so that the title, which served as punchline and climax in the book, doesn't even apply.In the first movie the vampires were more like zombies (probably the models for George Romero's in Night of the Living Dead), in the second they were changed into a mutant cult that seemed rather silly, but even then they made up a unified force and had a certain stature to them. In this movie they're just Mutant Enemies; they might as well be baboons. The movie is set up like a video game. The director keeps it from looking like one, and that's to his credit, but the flamboyance of his imagination turns it into a French comic book instead. He probably doesn't do seedy.--which means, more or less, that he doesn't do suspense.",4,1,2,23 November 2008
The Illusionist," Tricksy
","This is pretty much the same movie as that other conjuring movie which popped out of Hollywood's hat around the same time. It's not the same story, but the same movie, with (1) the same twist ending, which is obvious, once one thinks about it (and is probably the ending to every conjuring story ever written); (2) an atmosphere approximating, but only approximating, that of its subject; (3) some cheating on the first rule of conjuring stories not magical fantasies, that all the tricks must be rationally explainable; and (4) a lot of sepia (from the time before things were colored normally). However, this movie differs from the other in featuring (1) leading actors who are less fittingly cast and speak in funny accents, which hinder the suspension of disbelief; (2) an even more artificial design, but with it (3) some more striking images; and (4) a clearer, simpler, and therefore more interesting story, but with it (5) an ending that brings in one or two too many irrelevant flashbacks, thereby becoming unclear, and seeming to be a cheat when it isn't (I _think_, having just belatedly worked the whole thing out). For me the main drawback of both movies (or of any movie of the same type) is that I never could believe the characters were the greatest conjurers ever seen, or (granting for the stories' sake that they were) understand why they would be. I think that may be a literary idea, conveyable in a novel but showing its speciousness in a movie. And in the end, it's the only idea conveyed, so the viewer has gained nothing by granting it for the story's sake: it _is_ the story.Moreover, I wonder whether it isn't a bit of a fake, this conceit of the miraculous mandarin-magician. I realize it's not being offered as a historical fact but a happy idea--but is it one that a true lover of magic shows (I like them but I don't love them) would respond to? Or would he find it empty and meaningless? ...Just wondering.",7,0,1,20 April 2008
Clash of the Titans," 'way cooler than the original
","I'm glad somebody finally made a cool movie of this. It delivers what the posters for the original promised but audiences didn't get: magic, heroism, and thrills. It's absorbing and exciting--The Scorpion King done like Lord of the Rings--with the most awesome flying horse ever, giant scorpions to make you check under your bed, a Medusa that's both gorgeous and creepy, and classy English actors giving heaps of panache to stirring swashbuckler and Biblical-movie lines. The 11-year-old boy in me, who had wriggled with boredom through the clunky first movie, was glued to the screen for this one (the TV screen, I mean: he and I watched it on DVD), and as far as he was concerned it blew its predecessor out of the water.But even he got that although it actually is cool it's also trying hard to be cool, which makes it not as cool as if it weren't, and that almost as many things in it don't work as do; notably the Olympian gods, with their extremely peculiar costuming. And he didn't get why it had to be such a mishmash. The director of it did the Transporter movies, which were no deathless classics but were professionally put together; this one looks in places as if it had been run through a food processor. Voiceovers set up the back story at unnecessary and confusing length, yet some of the simplest incidents are never explained. Like, suddenly the whole court of Argos knows that Perseus is Zeus's son, when he doesn't know it himself: why doesn't he, and why do they? The script of the original took considerable liberties with the myth; this one is a free-form improvisation on those liberties, without credit to their author. So whereas movie #1, for once following the myth, ends with Perseus and Andromeda getting together--which is kind of the point of the story--in the remake he goes off with someone else, brought in from another myth. Anything can happen at any time, and often does. (One of the unexpected events is that somewhere during his quest Perseus picks up an Australian accent.) However, the bottom line is, it works. It's like a party that got out of control: it's a huge mess, and something somebody probably should have put a stop to, but that doesn't make it any less fun.",7,1,8,29 September 2010
Paranormal Activity," So much nothing
","Here's another un-film pretending to be someone's home video, and gutting the language of movie-making. Construction is fragmentary; movement, composition, and juxtaposition are next to meaningless; and however any such movie is shot, it ends up looking like all the others. A few talented directors, perhaps seeing those limits as a challenge, have managed to do relatively interesting things within the form, e.g. the way Jaume Balagueró staged Rec so that the actions looked accidental rather than choreographed. By contrast, PA is just a series of indifferently written, poorly shot scenes depicting a few unexciting incidents experienced by unintelligent characters in an uninteresting setting. If most horror films are basically twenty-minute stories with padding, this one is a three-minute story--in effect a YouTube joke clip, except that you have to wait forever to get to the punchline, and when you do it makes no sense. The film does succeed as a demo reel for Katie Featherston, whose impersonation of a reality-show subject is convincing enough to carry the show, or would be if there were a show to carry. This one is so much nothing.",2,0,2,12 April 2010
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Original, sincere, and melancholy
","This has to be one of the most original musicals ever, if not the one most original. It has something to say, and a new way of saying it. For once in a rock movie, content exceeds style, so that there's something to see in every shot, but you have to pay attention to catch it. Since it is a musical, I wish that it had had some dancing in it, apart from the little the band does in its performances. But I can see that the story didn't allow for this.Hedwig isn't totally realized. It's a stage show that has only been half converted into a movie. I recognize that if it had been opened up and broken up any further, it would no longer have been the same piece, and probably would have lost more than it gained. But it has acclimated itself so little to film that the style of the musical numbers, and the charge they must have packed on stage, aren't carried over. The numbers are photographed straight, without resort to crazy angles and flash editing. Perhaps the director saw these as clichés and deliberately avoided them.And perhaps this movie isn't as innovative as I think. I'm not young and hip, I'm old and stodgy; and what I see as new may be old. Anyhow, by the time any piece of culture has found its way into a play, it's at least six months past its heyday (if not its expiration date) and, by the time the play becomes a film, a year farther on towards decrepitude. But within the boundaries of my old and stodgy perspective, I can aver without doubt that I've never seen a movie quite like this one.I happened onto it by looking for something on the order of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but better done. That's a pretty exact description of it. The superiority to the earlier movie is all-encompassing: the music more original, the lyrics more literate, and replete with references to everything under the sun, the book more in touch with cultural and political realities. To be fair, there would never have been a Hedwig without a Rocky Horror to have paved the way. But something like that could be said of virtually all art.Hedwig's most obvious resemblance to Rocky Horror is in its special pleading for an alternative, unrestrictive sexuality. Rocky Horror, in its one half-serious scene, argued on behalf of pan-sexuality (even thirty years later, the sermonish quality of the speech still comes across as a little offensive); the character of Hedwig occupies a borderland state in between male and female, a result of a bizarre surgical accident. This fantastic, or at best extreme, condition serves as a sort of distorting lens through which the movie is able to focus on his dual sexual nature. That takes it beyond camp (which I dislike) into an exploration of his sex, or sexes, which is purposely skewed but, allowing for that, essentially sincere and truthful.The best illustration of the approach is a love-sex scene between Hedwig and his friend-enemy. Hedwig's sexuality, as noted, is ambiguous, but the scene of course is, and is played as, between two males. As such, it's the first male-male love scene I've seen in a mainstream movie (if Hedwig can be called a mainstream movie) that hasn't made me uncomfortable. I always figured my discomfort arose from an old-fashioned preference that movies remain chaste and bourgeois; now I think it wasn't that. This scene has little regard for the proprieties, but it's inoffensive regardless, because for once the people in it are really attracted to each other, want each other, need each other. In other words, it's a love scene that happens to be between men; not a GAY LOVE SCENE without love or sexual feeling, as such scenes formerly have been. (Note: Straight love scenes are the same. But they've been around so long that one accepts them as a convention without examining them closely.) Apart from the sexual reorientation, the most striking quality of the movie is its melancholy. That isn't at all what one expects in a rock musical. It's a Swiftian melancholy, comic in the extremity of its satire, and bitter almost to the point of despair: 'My guardian angel fell asleep on the watch,' Hedwig sings. To the wanderers in the desert, rock music is pictured as an oasis ('Hold on to each other,...all the misfits and the losers'), and from this perspective all the attributes of the form, from its chord progressions to its musicians' convulsions during performance, fall into place. What looks from the outside like simple rejection is a process of working through life's impositions (like the 'angry inch'). In the end, with luck, it leads the sufferer such as Hedwig to an affirmation of himself, his needs of the moment giving way to the deeper need. Behind its graffitied exterior, this movie has a lot of understanding, I think, for the loser, the untouchable, the odd man out. I liked it a lot.",8,0,1,17 November 2008
Pride & Prejudice," Prejudice .150, Pride .000
","Shortly before seeing this I'd reread the book and reseen the BBC serial, which took pains to convey the book's events and meanings faithfully. This movie doesn't do that so much, and in the publicity material on the DVD producer, director, and writer all agree on the text's being about the family's great love for each other; the writer even argues that Mrs. Bennet is a heroic character because of her great love for her daughters. This seems to me a flagrant misreading of the text; fortunately it isn't apparent in the movie, but the deficiency of humor it suggests is: the book is funny very often, the movie very seldom. The director imbues it with much vigor of an unsuitable type, which at times threatens to turn it into Wuthering Heights, at other times into Sharpe's Rifles. But even that would have been tolerable if the two leads had been more wisely cast. Matthew Macfayden as Darcy is none of the things the character is said to be, except dark; most of the time he just looks dopey and dour, like Jim Nabors trying to do Soames Forsyte. I assume he can appear more attractive than he's photographed here; the camera doesn't do very charitably by anyone, except the star, for whom the movie seems designed primarily as a modeling showcase. Keira Knightley does give intelligent readings of her lines--rather as if she'd just been listening to an audiobook of the novel--but they're always being nullified by her face, which rotates the same three or four expressions throughout, one of them an unnervingly vulpine baring of her upper teeth, none of them especially suitable to Elizabeth Bennet or to anything she might feel. Knightley comes to life once, in her big scene with Judi Dench, which suggests she might become an actress some day, if she would ever stop doing things so she could actually do something.",3,2,5,4 May 2006
Saw," Needed sharpening
","I found this movie impossible to watch all the way through  not for being too frightening but for being too dumb. It was one of several so-called 'torture porn' movies I made a point of watching to understand what the genre consisted of, and after watching them I understood it less than before: they weren't all alike, Saw was the only one the label seemed possibly to fit, by one of the two competing definitions in my head. Where I got either from or whether I just inferred them both I don't know, but if the term doesn't mean one or the other I don't know what it could mean. Definition number one is: a movie that uses torture scenes as porn, that is, to gratify the audience erotically; definition number two is: a movie that uses torture scenes in place of porn, so that they comprise its entire content, or reason for being. Saw may meet the second definition, if one supposes, as one easily might, that it exists mainly as an excuse to describe and illustrate the ordeals the movie's maniac puts his victims through. These are all on the level of a gross-out game played by thirteen-year-old boys  what if I sewed up piranhas in your stomach and I sewed up a bottle of piranha poison in one of your sister's arms or legs but you didn't know which one so you had to cut them all off and then she'd bleed to death or else the piranhas would eat your stomach and you'd die? Not only the maniac's schemes but everything he does, and everything the cops after him does, are on the same level of head-pounding stupidity, and this is what makes the movie unendurable.But the strange thing is that this nonsense, while taking up most of the screen time, isn't the main story: it's the _filler_. The main story is about two guys trapped in a basement in a him-or-me situation that seems as if it can only end in violence and the death of one or the other: in essence a Grande Guignol one-act; and it isn't bad at all. Rewritten and improved, probably by a different hand, it could have been very good indeed. The drama between the characters, the increasing tension of their situation, the suspense of their efforts to escape could have made a good, tense half-hour film or TV episode. But obviously it wouldn't be enough to fill out a ninety-minute movie, and so the rest of it is padded with the cops-and-loony story alluded to above. The director is too flashy and too little focused to build an atmosphere of suspense or fear (to see what's missing  and limiting the comparison to movies with similar subjects  refer to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Creep), and so the movie becomes depressing, because in the absence of fear or any other emotion it's just depressing to watch people struggling through paths of barbed wire, broken glass, &c., or to watch a child terrorized. However, I have a feeling the guys who made this movie and the guys who like it view the ability to enjoy such things vicariously as a proof of maleness, and that in fact the existence of a movie like this owes less to the splatter tradition than to Chuck Palahniuk (whom guys read to show they're man enough to). At cross-purposes, then, I and they: because I'd rather the culture I inhabit be not as of thirteen-year-old boys.Or thirteen-year-old men.",2,3,5,6 April 2008
There Will Be Blood," But couldn't there be some life along with it?
","Movies have probably grown worse over the years, generally speaking. But in this century and the years immediately preceding, they've grown worse in a weirdly unpleasant way, or combination of ways. The why and how are mysterious.I'm referring only to serious movies. Not romantic comedies, which are only a little worse than they ever were, or blood-and-thunder adventure stories, which are probably a little better, or at least bigger. I'm referring to the movies that never crack a smile and, if any spectator should be injudicious enough to do so, wipe it right off his face. There Will Be Blood is one of these. So it isn't uniquely bad, but it's worse, or at any rate less easily watchable, than most others. I believe that's because it was made by a director, and with a star, who were out of their element.So sober have movies become these days that their very titles are threats: There Will Be Blood; No Country for Old Men; Atonement. They warn us that they're going to be no fun, so don't even look for it. And they deliver on the threat.Every couple of decades, movies go through a phase of ordeals, of putting the audience through the mill. Sometimes the object is just to sell the show by challenging people to see if they're tough enough to take it; other times, as lately, the object is redemption, or the illusion of it. The movies are a penance for our imagined sins, and after suffering through them we're supposed to emerge purified, or feeling purified. And Hollywood always this kind of movie for Oscars, as though in an effort to be purged of its sins, too.Only now, following in the classic American tradition of both eating our cake and having it, the redemption is at second hand: we're no longer expiating our own sins but someone else's, putting us two up morally. In the era of There Will Be Blood, the wrongdoers aren't us, aren't characters we can identify ourselves with; they're the other guy: probably, in these war years, the President who 'started' it.The movies seek to improve us, not to interest us. This used to be their primary concern, but they gave it up at the onset of the 90s, and now don't even make the pretense of enlisting our attention. Evidently they feel they don't need it any more, and they're perfectly right. Once their success depended on the audience's good will; now they're all presold in advance and have no need to cater to anybody.As a pair of contrasting examples, take My Left Foot and this movie (which, coincidentally, star the same actor). My Left Foot, which came at the close of the prior era, the era of audience involvement, opened with the main character putting a record on a gramophone and switching the gramophone on--all using his foot. I defy anyone who sees that not to want to find out who the person is that can do that.There Will Be Blood opens with the main character picking away in a mine, and keeps on him doing this for possibly fifteen minutes. Who he is, where he is, and what he's about, other than mining, we don't know. We're not even granted a voice-over narration, of the type to which almost every movie nowadays succumbs to avoid having to do its job.This abundance of voice-overs testifies to the same fault as our uninvolvement in the movies: the movies are incompletely written, their stories not fully worked out, their characters only half-understandable. Reviewers sometimes point out the unsatisfactory endings, not noticing that they're unsatisfactory because the beginnings and middles were the same. If the stories were sound, and the movie makers stuck to them, they'd go a long way toward making up for, or rectifying, the other faults described.In There Will Be Blood, when the story finally does start, it doesn't move naturally, but lurches or lunges from one tableau to another. Eventually it becomes more consecutive, but it never unbends. In this, too, it's typical of today's movies. They assume a stiff and sober demeanor, like someone dressed up in mourning clothes that are too tight; rigid in posture, slow of step. They're movies that can hardly move.This one didn't have to be that way. Daniel Day Lewis, who dominates it utterly, is by nature a restricted and restricting actor, but there have been times when he's been able to break free of his bonds. Always this has been when he's playing a character who's analogously blocked and has to fight through what's blocking him, cf. Christy in My Left. His role in this movie is the opposite, freewheeling and unbounded: a zealous proselytizer for free enterprise. It's a part for a big, expansive actor, and out of Lewis's natural range. So is the American accent he affects, which becomes a kind of speech impediment and renders the emotional meanings of his scenes almost uninterpretable.The director is on the wrong track also. In a previous movie, Punch Drunk Love, Paul Thomas Anderson showed his natural metier was comedy--pessimistic screwball comedy, to judge by that movie, which was lovely and intuitive. Anderson could be the next Preston Sturges. But here he's being Terence Malick, with a static, disjointed historical epic whose eye that keeps drifting toward the landscape and whose leading character talks funny. The difference from Malick's movies is that they're always watchable and occasionally light up the past, albeit in flashes. They indicate that Malick is given to meditating on the past, whereas this movie indicates Anderson is little at home there, and isn't particularly meditative. He's a good guy and a talented moviemaker; he's simply in the wrong ballpark.A serious film--the real thing--is not that hard to differentiate from the would-bes. It has that within which passeth show; these but the trappings and the suits of woe.",4,2,6,2 November 2008
Sherlock Holmes," Sent up, went up
","This isn't the movie the critics--and, apparently, its makers--took it for. In interviews the actors and the director talked about it as if it were a straight mystery, but what it turns out to be is a Victorian pastiche, in the mode of The Assassination Bureau or The League of Gentlemen, with a farcical Holmes and Watson at its center. I personally like pastiches, but this one I didn't find very enjoyable, well appointed though it is; the violence is too nasty and most of the cast unlikable. A couple of scenes work because the dominant actors, Geraldine James and Edward Fox respectively, know how to play them; but then each disappears and we're left with the glumly miscast principals, among them the estimable Mark Strong, who might have made an interesting Holmes but is stranded playing a stock villain. In addition, the story is boring: Holmes' deductions are superfluous, none of the characters has a stake in the outcome, nothing that can happen will make any difference. The whole thing just floats away.",4,6,8,19 December 2010
1408," Noisy rather than scary
","1408 demonstrates in many particulars how not to tell a ghost story.The story being told, or trying to be told, is this: A skeptical ghost writer (a writer on ghosts, that is not an unattributed author) sets out to spend a night in a haunted room and finds out that it's for real--which is rather the conclusion one expects, since otherwise there would be no story. It's a story told before, and one that would in theory be simple to manage, since it contains only a few essential elements; yet every one of them is mishandled here.The least of the movie's problems, but the one that becomes obvious soonest, lies with the main character. What is he exactly? A skeptic about ghosts. Which means that he writes skeptical books, yes? Well, no: he writes ghost travel guides with titles like Ten Haunted Lighthouses. So he poses as a believer, and keeps his skepticism to himself? Well, no again: in public appearances, he scoffs openly at ghosts. So he's a hack who affects the tone of a believer? No a third time: when he dictates notes to himself for use in the book, they're in the key of Menckenian cynicism. It wouldn't matter much to the story which way he bent, but we needed to know, so we could proceed from there.And then there's the room itself. It isn't just any haunted room, it's a room that the hotel pretends doesn't exist, a room that has killed or driven insane all who have dared to sleep in it, the mother of all evil rooms. The movie makes this point for a good half hour before showing us the dread cubicle. Not content with showing us the writer's Internet researches and the maneuvers to which he has to resort to book a reservation, it continues to a lengthy scene with the hotel manager issuing dire warnings to the writer to stay away. In this scene the casting of the manager is crucial because he's the character who sells us the lore--the Van Helsing character--and who sells us the danger--'Wear this for your mother's sake'; the one who _believes_. And whom did the director choose to perform these two invaluable functions? Samuel L. Jackson. Now, Jackson is a good actor, in some circumstances, but he's an actor who when he believes in a thing, performs it straight, and when he doesn't, performs it crookeder than a dog's hind leg, and what he's going on about here, he obviously doesn't believe for a second. Anticipating the haunting that ensues, his scene with the writer goes on and on, around and around, long after it has made its point; and then the character, to clinch his presentation, produces a scrapbook of morgue shots of the room's earlier victims. Guess he keeps it for reminiscence' sake. Nevertheless undissuaded, the writer treks up to the room; and The Terror Begins. Or, well, not.Note the job that the movie has set itself: it has promised not just a haunted room but the most haunted room ever, and the most deadly haunted room ever. To deliver on that, it has to show the most frightening chamber that ever was, containing the most frightening thing that ever was, and moreover, one that will explain to our complete satisfaction why the people who encounter it go loony and take out their eyes and do away with themselves. And beyond all that, the movie has (or ought) to tell us whether it's 'the room' doing it, as we've been told, or some as yet unsuspected Lovecraftian entity that dwells there. Does it need to be said that the movie fails to deliver? Of course, nothing it could conjure up could measure up to what it has led us to anticipate. The build-up was a terribly unwise tactic: like prefacing a joke by promising that it's the funniest joke you'll ever hear and that everyone who hears it laughs for weeks. Oversell. Moreover, we nver find out why the room is as it is, or just _how_ it is. One infers that what it assails each new guest with is a nonpareil...but what? the one phobia too frightening to confront? the one misdeed too enormous to acknowledge? the one memory too painful to recall? or what? One scene suggests the last, or might, if it weren't buried in a mass of irrelevant nonsense.The haunting goes on. And on. And on--you think it's over, but no. The movie is much the same. It throws in everything but the kitchen sink (including a gollum living in the air ducts), and as it goes it keeps getting bigger, with enough catastrophe for a historical miniseries: flood, fire, earthquake...no childbirth, I don't think, but maybe I just missed it--and to ever-decreasing effect, like a horror Riverdance. Until the physical properties of the room came to exceed sensible bounds, what continued to occur to me was: why doesn't the guy bash through the wall? Indeed, at the end he does resort to destruction, of a kind, and it works. But by then there's no good reason why it should work, since nothing has worked before. There's no good reason for anything that happens in the movie. Which makes it just noise.",2,2,4,8 April 2008
Casino Royale," Simply the best
","To begin with, I'd like to echo what a lot of other people have said: that this is the best Bond movie ever, with the best Bond--and also, I would add, the best Bond girl; or woman, rather. It's not only a good Bond movie, it's good independently of that label, which probably can't be said of any of the others after the first two. I'd hoped the producers would return to the start of the cycle redo all the other novels with the same flair and bite; this hope was probably naive.I've become convinced that a lot of movies, especially those belonging to popular forms, can be boiled down to a small number of essentials, or one essential, that conveys the intended experience more strongly than the whole does. Take, for instance, the Hammer horror films of the 50s and 60s. They can be boiled down to one film, the first: Christopher Lee's premiere appearance as Dracula. The film can be boiled down to its musical score, and the score can be boiled down to one phrase: the three-note 'Dracula' signature, as first heard over the name Dracula on his casket. That's the basic experience of the movie, and it only takes a few seconds. The rest just approximates to it in varying degrees.And so with the Bond series. It can be boiled down to the first (or any of the others, for that matter), and that can be boiled down in turn the opening view through a gunsight--a view to a kill--and the playing of the Bond theme. None of the movies ever matched that music. Casino Royale is the first one that tries, or appears to try, to expand the effect of the theme into the movie and sustain it for two and a half hours. And it comes as close as any movie could (possibly excepting North by Northwest).It does have a few faults. Most obviously, it's too long by a half hour; and I know just the two climaxes that comprise that half hour. Omitting them would improve the movie--but I don't know what would be put in their places. Also, one of Bond's lines, in a bar, is so esoteric that after half a dozen hearings I still don't understand it. But those are the only complaints.Daniel Craig isn't a Bond we expect, but is all the more interesting for that. He has a 'clipped, puzzled-idealist brutality' appropriate to the enlarged and improved version of Bond he gets to play. The quotation suits him to a T--but remarkably, it's an old description of Cary Grant when he played a secret agent in Notorious; and it will be remembered that he was the producers' first choice for Bond. In Casino Royale they have given Craig the scenes, to which he brings the ability, to enable him to make Bond into a rounded character. There's a lot going on inside him. One clever tactic the actor uses is to base his character's movements on parkour, especially in one scene where he searches a room by moving into, over, and out of it in the swiftest possible manner.A characteristic of Craig's that helps him here, and which he shares with a lot of other Scottish actors: is that he's always on firm ground, wherever he is. You never doubt that he's in the place he's supposed to be, and that you're there with him. The Golden Compass, for instance, seemed to be drifting until Craig strode in and anchored it (then a few minutes later he strode out again and the film resumed drifting). Here he does the same whenever he's in view--which is almost all the time--and convinces you of what's happening, however fantastic it may appear.He is aided immeasurably by having a fully drawn heroine opposite him. Unlike most Bond films, this one is a two-handed game. The woman brings him out, and he does the same for her. Eva Green was a great casting choice as his partner: assured but vulnerable, practical but romantic. The way in which we become acquainted with her parallels our getting to know Bond all over again. She begins as the stock Bond girl, and gains dimension until she, probably even more than Bond, is the character we most want to see, and to try to figure out.The script is similarly generous to Judi Dench as M, who gives by far her best performance in a Bond film--not only because she has a strong arc to play but has also, in the new Bond, a character to truly contend against. The producers have reinvigorated the franchise with complete success.I had been looking forward to the follow-up movie, but now that it's on the horizon I feel somewhat apprehensive. At bottom, Casino Royale has the simple, appealing story idea of the novel, which was a 'hook' for the audience; I can't see that the sequel has one. CR is a little bit fantastic--albeit less so than most of the other Bonds--and I can't see that if the sequel is. I have a sinking feeling that the producers are wanting to turn the Bond series into something that better befits our more prosaic times: something like Robert Ludlum maybe? I hope they don't intend to jettison the Fleming influence entirely. I want to more movies just like this one.It was worth waiting forty-five years for.",10,2,6,28 October 2008
The Sixth Sense," Not good (POSSIBLE SPOILER)
","As I watched this I became increasingly exasperated by its failure to go anywhere, indeed by the impossibility of its going anywhere because of the plot gimmick it saddled itself with. The gimmick is clumsily concealed, requires cheating throughout (some of which the film tries to excuse by making up its own 'rules' as it goes), and was a bad idea from the outset, making the story ultimately silly. The construction of the script is deformed accordingly. And it isn't a skillful script: much of the dialogue is awkward, many of the characters' lines and actions are unprepared for and are never followed up on, and almost any moment that works superficially seems false and unfelt, and is usually contradicted by something else later on. Fortunately, the direction is better than the writing. I recall at least three good moments, all due to performances of supporting players. But the leading actors are all miscast--even the kid--and the visuals are a catalog of borrowings from other, better ghost movies. More fundamentally, this film goes against a central rule of fantasy: fantasy says openly that what is not so is so, and if the reader or viewer rejects it, so much the worse for him. It doesn't try to con its audience, to put something over on them. And I should say that that is even more true of sentimental fantasy. If it has to trick people into accepting it by impersonating a horror film (and inserting twenty minutes of one into itself so it can be sold that way), it shows scant confidence in the genre it has chosen, matching its scant skill in manipulating the conventions of that genre. Ghost didn't need to pretend to be The Shining. I like ghost stories and sentimental fantasies; this is an uncomprehending and, in my view, insincere example of both.",4,0,2,10 April 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of all things
","I had expected to enjoy this film as much as the first two, or even more; but I felt glad when it was over, and my disappointment makes me feel ungenerous toward it. Technically it's the best of the three, less slapped-together-looking, and some parts of it succeed, finally, in capturing the authentic Tolkien atmosphere. But some parts--and sometimes the same parts--are just boring, others are just noisy, the director has begun to repeat himself, and in this culminating installment his inability to come to grips with the crux of the story becomes evident.The previous films, despite their faults, held me all the way through; this one had me wanting to leave after a few minutes. The previous films filled me with a sense of wonder, over and over; this one has it only seldom (as in the lighting of the beacons), and in some places where it might show, it's swamped by the director's overfondness for grue and beasties. I never liked his Orcs (extras in Halloween masks), and here he turns the army of the dead into the Pirates of the Caribbean. The previous films kept me in the world they created; this one kept throwing me out of it, particularly in the scenes of Minas Tirith--where, as an example, the faces, unlike those of the Shire and Rohan, included several that were joltingly contemporary (possibly belonging to friends of the director). The previous films, though of course they cut much from the books, included the essentials of the story; this one eliminates much, including everything to do with Saruman (the parley at Orthanc, the pollution of the Shire, the fates of Saruman and Wormtongue). We see Eowyn and Merry's wounding, but not their healing; we see a Palantir, but not Denethor's; we see Sam with the Ring, but not his use of it. Instead the film squanders most of its time on fighting: not only the battle scenes, which are terrific for a while but go on and on, recycling the same effects again and again, but also wrestling bouts between Sam and Gollum, Frodo and Gollum, Sam and Frodo, Sam and Shelob, etc. Then there are the scenes showing again and again--what was established upon Gollum's first appearance--that he's a treacherous villain and Sam doesn't trust him. But the main fault of the film--and of the others, though it becomes crucial here--is its relative shallowness. It fails to convey the feeling, or the moral meaning, of Frodo's struggle with the Ring. The director resorts to externals--dialogues with Gollum the fallen one, Frodo's alter ego--without ever getting inside Frodo himself. Nor do we ever understand what the Ring is and what it means. The same is true of the event from which this film takes its title. Aragorn gets his sword back, gets a crown and a good cheer, and that's it. His union with Arwen comes down in the end to a juicy kiss. And, incomprehensibly, the film omits the most important line of all, Frodo's, when he says what it's all been in aid of: 'It must often be so when things are in danger: that some people have to give them up so that others may keep them.'To be fair to the filmmakers, they may simply have butted up against the central problem which confronted them at the outset: Tolkien's books and characters aren't dramatic. Individual scenes in the films are dramatic, the actors are compelling enough personalities to put them across, and the combination makes for good theatre. But, as has been well said by the Eldar, it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing.",4,2,3,18 December 2003
Slumdog Millionaire," The feel-bad movie of the year
","'The feel-good movie of the year!' promises the quote headlined on the DVD jacket; and that certainly was how the movie was sold. Remembering previous movies directed by Danny Boyle--stories about miserable people in dead-end situations--I wondered what his idea of a feel-good movie would be.I found out soon enough: a story about even more miserable people at a dead end even more definite; a story that begins in torture and ends in a double murder, with betrayal, abduction, theft, robbery, mutilation, and more murders along the way. The movie's claim to feel-good status rests on a 'happy ending' that takes up perhaps five minutes and feels more like an appendix, the story proper having concluded as it commenced, i.e. miserably. The ending didn't make me feel good, and I don't see how it could inspire such a feeling in anyone who was paying it close attention.How did it make me feel? Confused; because it seemed to follow from nothing that had preceded. The boy and the girl live happily ever after, in prosperity and contentment--but no, that isn't actually the ending; that's only our inference from the ending. The movie doesn't show it, and what a movie doesn't show in effect doesn't happen. The actual ending is that the boy and the girl meet and kiss. And even that is...well, what is it? It isn't realistic, and can't have been intended to be taken as such. But neither is it romantic, since the movie lacks the layer of sentiment that such an ending would require. It isn't fantastical, and it isn't satirical. In fact, it makes no sense, however you try to read it.The inexplicableness of the conclusion led me to look back at the story more critically, and when I did I found it the same all through. I don't know what mode it's supposed to be in. It's based on what sounds like the 'happy idea' of traditional comedy: a poor boy competes in a TV quiz show and amazes everyone by knowing all the answers, since every one of them is something he has discovered during one of the major events in his life. But the movie isn't a comedy. And supposing it were, I still wouldn't know what the point of the idea was. Again, it clearly isn't an observation from real life. Is it intended as an optimistic statement, showing that all experience yields knowledge? Or as darkly comic, showing that after the many horrors the boy has endured, all he has to show for it is a few negligible bits of trivia? Or as inspirational, in that he turns a life of defeats into victory? One can only guess.The best clue the movie offers is the structure, as far as it can be discerned in spite of the director's efforts to fragment it. From it I would guess that the original novel was a step or two distant from reality. The story is laid out in a series of discrete episodes from the boy's life, each containing the answer to one of the questions on the quiz show. In the movie we hear the question, we see the flashback relating to it, and then we flash-forward again to the answer. This seems more artificial and tedious when acted out literally than it would on the page. And paradoxically, the movie's attempts to disguise its repetitiveness only make it seem more intrusive. Had it been treated in the same way as a recurring pattern in music, it might have given the movie a solid form. As it is, it's constantly broken up: sometimes we're in the TV studio as the quiz show is going on, sometimes we're in a police station watching it; the shifts are so random that often we don't know where or when we are. In fact, it wasn't until well into the film that I grasped the boy wasn't only replaying his life in memory, he was also telling it to the police. Once we know this, we can't be sure whether we're seeing events as he's recollecting them, as he's recounting them, or as they originally happened. Clarity appears not to have been the director's primary objective.What he does seem to have been after is to keep things moving. And he does succeed at that. This is a running, jumping, and not-standing-still film. For instance, it contains two street chases that go on much longer than needed--if either sequence were needed--with no apparent purpose other than to add some physical action. The scenes of violence raise the same suspicion, and come off seeming sensationalized, however undoubted the reality they reflect. Probably Boyle has a genuine concern for the victims he portrays, but his hyping of the atrocities they have to endure tends to call that into question, as does the fact that the same kinds of bad things happen in his zombie and space movies as in this purported social document. And frankly, I couldn't help feeling that a lot of it was just the director superimposing himself onto the material. At the end, indeed, he does so almost literally. In what would have an enjoyable dance number in the Bollywood style, he continually pastes credits on top of the dancers, as well as cutting away from them every few seconds. He seems unable to keep himself out of it.Similarly, he hashes up the narrative, jumping from one stage of the boy's life to the next, while paying scant attention to how he got from one to the other, and never slowing down enough to show what he feels and thinks. That is especially true when it comes his relations with his brother, so critical to the story, which are depicted only in the most generalized and movie-ish way.If I'm going to watch a meaningless movie, I'd rather it were a feel-better one.",4,17,24,17 May 2009
