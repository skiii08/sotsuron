The Blair Witch Project," The witch has no clothes.
","This one is like the fable about the Emperor and his new clothes. He didn't have any, and the Blair Witch doesn't have any. This thing was awful, I wanted to like it, I expected to like it, I tried to like it, I came away hating it. I saw this thing three times, and while it's got a great idea, and it's not terrible for a student film say, it's far far too long and boring for the one trick it's got to pull, I simply am at a loss as to how so many people can allegedly have loved this thing.",1,79,145,24 March 2001
Independence Day," A huge pile of steaming dreck
","I hated this movie, it was a nice idea, but the execution was simply awful. This movie stole all the wrong bits from all the classic B movies from the past, and somehow failed to respect any of them. In addition to it's mangling of fifties B movie cliches, and implausible plot filled with insipid action sequences this movie tried, and failed to hold a light tone through a sequence where the world is nearly destroyed. Millions are slaughtered needlessly and then we're supposed to laugh just a few minutes later, I just couldn't buy any of that.  Will Smith is the only bright spot in an otherwise dreadful waste of a hundred million dollars.",1,6,10,25 February 2001
