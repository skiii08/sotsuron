The Expendables 2," Good, better, Willis, Schwarzenegger, Stallone
","Barney Ross (Stallone) is back and with his band of mercenaries he must once go to the extreme to get the job done. This time they're up against the villain Villain (Van Damme) who, with his crimes, is threatening the entire world.Let me just state: This is a GREAT action movie! We're 5 minutes into the movie and I've lost count on how many bad boys are ready for their own funeral. The action in the movie is more or less non-stop, but it never really seems to become too much.The cast is simply sublime. They all play their role to perfection and there is a great chemistry between the actors.They storyline of the movie is rather thin, but it's okay, because I didn't see this movie to become intellectual challenged. This is a action movie in all intense and purposes. Do I want to see the movie again? YES!!! The dialog is just fantastic with a continuously flood of references to other movies the actors have been in and real life events. And come on, who wouldn't want to see Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger standing on a line eradicating 50% of the worlds combined terrorists in 20 seconds?Rating: 9/10",9,1,10,11 September 2012
Remember the Titans," Great story. Good movie.
","Remember The Titans (2000) The true story about the African-American high school football-coach Herman Boone (Washingon) who in 1971 becomes the head coach for the newly race mixed team of T.C. Williams High School. Needless to say, nobody is interested in playing on a mixed race team or even supporting it. But can people of mixed races learn to function together and bond friendships?This movie delivers a great performance by all the actors, especially by the two coaches Denzel Washington and Will Patton. The story line of the movie, though taken out of real life, is very good and gives you a lot to think about.Do I want to see the movie again? Yes. I wouldn't stand in line for several hours, but if the opportunity reveals itself, I wouldn't mind seeing it again.Rating 7/10.",7,0,1,11 September 2012
