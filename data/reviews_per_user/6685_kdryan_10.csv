Casablanca," A masterwork for all time...
","There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Caf√© American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover. As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on. Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him. This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.",10,520,597,10 November 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," I must not get it...
","Mark Twain once said 'A classic is a book that is often talked about but never read.'  I get the feeling that most of Stanley Kubrick's films fall into this category.  I have seen most of Kubrick's films now and I really have to say I think they're not very good.  There are exceptions; 2001 and Lolita stand out as great films.  But the wife and I bought this one tonight and I really think this a pretty boring movie.  It has it's points, it has irony, it could probably even happen.  I think however, the acting sucked, the jokes were out of place and ill timed (and yes maybe a bit too subtle) and it has lost most of it's relevance today.  I put it in the category with 'A Clockwork Orange' and the apallingly boring 'Eyes Wide Shut",8,1,3,12 April 2001
Spirited Away," A Masterwork that will be hard to equal...
","I had never seen a movie by Miyazaki before this one, although I consider myself a fan of Japanese cinema.  This movie has made me a fan though, and I do not feel the need to see more.  I will see them, but I don't forsee anything topping this.  It's kind of like seeing Spielberg's Schindler's List then seeing 'Raiders' films.  Or better yet, it's like seeing a Monet's 'Water Lillies' and then seeing his preliminary sketches.  I cannot say enough about this film, I know it will be with me near the top of my list for a long time...BTW, for a kick, watch it in Japanes with English subtutles and hear it the way Miyazaki wanted it heard instead of John Lassiter.  There is nothing wrong with the English version, but I like to watch foreign films in their original language.",9,0,1,19 April 2003
Saving Private Ryan," An utterly memorable experience
","As my wife and I packed our rented Ryder truck to move from Florida to Chicago, my neighbor came walking by with his small white dog.  I had seen this man, with his little dog that was so small that it looked like it should have batteries, walk by my place for the better part of a year but never had a conversation with him.  He stopped by then and we chatted amicably about little things like the weather etc.  As we talked, I noticed a small brass pin on his ball cap that said 'D-Day Veteran.'  I was amazed. I collect all kinds of info on WWII airplanes and here was an opportunity to actually talk with a D-Day participant.  We chatted longer about those times and he invited me into his home to show me his souveniers of that period of his life.  There in an old newspaper clipping was a picture of a younger him indicating he had gone ashore at Dog Green Sector of Omaha Beach.  I cannot tell you the awe I felt in this mans presence.  For the uninitiated, this was the same sector that Tom Hanks' company was to have gone ashore in Saving Private Ryan.Ready for the last coincidence?  My last name is Ryan.This movie has only one flaw I can see.  We could have done nicely without the bookends of the old man at the tomb of Capt. Miller.  It was a very touching scene to be sure, but distracting to the movie as a whole.",10,0,0,6 December 1999
Moulin Rouge!," A 'Road to Wellville' for the new century
","If it weren't for Nicole Kidman looking more beautiful than any person ever has in any movie ever and what's his name singing 'Your Song', this movie would have gotten a 1 instead of the 2 that it did get.  It is so 'out there' that it is almost incomprehensible.  The acting is bad.  Yes, I understand is is arty to use modern songs in a past era, but there is a point and I don't think Kurt Cobain would much approve of using 'Smells like Teen Spirit' as part of (basically) a vaudeville act.  On a good note, the hidden references to modern songs are many and there is much that is amusing about the way they are used, but it does NOT make up for what is overall an attempt to get into the Guiness book of records for the most surrealistic picture ever.  I think that 'The Road to Welville' might have actually been better.  At least I sat through the whole picture.  But then, I was younger then so...BTW, I'm not kidding about the Nicole Kidman thing.  Incredible!!",7,0,1,10 June 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Very, Very, Good...
","For the next twenty years, every war (or anti war, I guess) movie will be compared to 'Saving Private Ryan' and not without just cause.  SPR is a fantastic movie, delivers a wonderful message, and almost singlehandedly rekindled this country's pride in our WWII veterans.  Unfortunately, that also means that excellent movies like this one will be compared and if they do not deliver the same earth-shattering impact that SPR did, they will suffer for it.I waited for the DVD of this movie and am glad I did.  With my family neatly tucked into bed, headphones on so I could listen at a respectable volume, on a 36' TV, I think I got as good a show as any I could have gotten from a theater.  At least there wasn't some moron behind me talking.  The story is as intense as any I have ever seen, the acting wonderful, and the scenery so authentic looking, I think it may even surpass that other movie.  The JU88's and Stuka's used in the film were all of course computer generated, but were used sparingly enough that I didn't even bother to look for flaws, but they did look grand for the time I did see them.]Oh, and BTW, Ed Harris is one of the two greatest actors alive today. Hands down and no argument.  I leave the other for you to fill in because I'll bet you can't think of more that equal him.",8,0,2,20 August 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," A very good (subjectively) review
","In 100 years there will be 'Casablanca.'  There will be 'Citizen Kane.' There will be '2001, A Space Oddessy.'  There will be 'The Godfather.'  And there will be 'The Shawshank Redemption.'  It is amazing that this much overlooked film has in six years reached the stature of a Hollywood legend, not only in my estimation but in the opinion of almost everyone I've spoken to about it.  This movie has gained a larger audience through word of mouth than it had the entire time it was in the theaters.  This is quite simply one of the three best movies I've ever seen.",10,0,0,6 December 1999
Shrek," Funny, but un-necessarily vulgar
","This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, flat out.  I do mean that, my wife and I have no children, but went to see it because it looked good and we like movies of this sort (A Bug's Life, Toy Stories 1 & 2, etc). I thought Mike Myers was great, Eddie Murphy greater and Cameron Diaz funny as all get out.  The sight gags, puns, in-jokes, and slight jabs at Disney were almost perfect.But did we really need to see a Donkey urinating on a fire to put it out? Or Shrek catching his dinner by passing gas in the water?  Or the incessant 'Ass' jokes?  I know kids find that kind of thing funny, along with the gross out stuff like eyeballs in the martini and the earwax candle; but come on, couldn't we come up with something a little less low-rent?  It's easy to come up with toilet humor, try coming up with something just as funny (like Pinnochio lying about being a real boy to save himself) that's not disgusting.I would have given this movie a 10 if they hadn't actually shown Donkey peeing on the fire.  As it sits, a solid 7",7,0,0,25 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Definitely doesn't suck...
","Spoilers ahead...Wow!  This is by far the greatest of the three films and anyone expecting to be disappointed going in should have a hard time coming out with their expectations met.  By some strange coincidence ROTK is the most faithful to the book AND the best of his three Rings films.  Almost everything here happens exactly as in the book, with minor exceptions for plot points such as the exact method of Denethor's demise.  I was slightly disappointed by Gandalf's out of hand dismissal of Pippin's attempt to swear loyalty to Denethor in honor of Boromir.  It always seemed a well done thing and a very emotional point in the book.I will say that while Sean Astin has grated on me from the first, especially with the cheesy speeches, here he redeems himself totally without reserve. Even though I have never liked the way the character was scripted, I can't think of anyone who would be better placed as Sam.  I didn't like that Frodo was allowed to be swayed so easily into abandoning Sam by Gollum, but it was well acted even if not 'in the book.'  Sean Astin IS Sam, the same way I can't think of anyone else who could have played Frodo.All in all, one really fantastic film!",9,0,0,31 December 2003
The Godfather," Truly awe-inspiring...
","I cannot add anything about this movie that hasn't already been said by people a lot more experienced about movies than I am. 
I can say this though.  Few movies have ever grabbed my attention and not let go like this one has.  Look at the expression on Al Pacino's face when he tells his brother never to take sides against the family again.  There is no doubt about the enormous anger he is fighting to control or about what the results will be if he ever loses that control.  Look at Marlon Brando as the reserved dignified old Don spending his last moments playing like a child with his grandson in the garden.  And look at Robert Duval when Sal pleads for the favor of his life after he has turned traitor to Michael. And last, look at Dianne Keaton in the last scene when she realizes the her husband IS the Godfather.These are the things that make a movie great.  Standout moments of acting by those who define acting.  These are the moments that elevate acting to an art form (and film is just as much an art form as painting or music or poetry).  This movie is FILLED with just such moments.",10,0,2,5 July 2003
