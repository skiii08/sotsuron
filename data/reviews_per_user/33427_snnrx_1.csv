Child 44," Gigantic Movie
",O boy!!! Wow what a movie... if you're movie lover you better watch this movie.. Wonderful acting as you'll feel they are real characters.. i know the title sounds little weird but you wont regret after watching the movie.. and ya its not a typical war movie or a drama thriller.. it has almost everything and you'll feel love struggle tragic and a message.. believe me its not a 6 rating movie its more of a 8+ or 9 rating movie..Tom Hardy has done justice so as Noomi Rapace.. Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke played minor roles..It's more like a movie u would love to see when you want something special to see..compare the variance of tom hardy's acting and his skills of expression with his first scene when he was describing about his love of life how he met his wife with the last scene when he was trying to tell those children that he cant bring their parents back from dead..boy that was something special by tom hardy.. never thought he could have done something like this esp after seen him as bane..conclusion: MUST WATCH,9,52,85,19 September 2015
