Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Why this movie ruin my Halloween in 2012
","Worse movie I have seen all year. The story line is ridiculous. Acting is cheesy, and it's far from scary. Its almost more of a comedy because it's frankly so horrible it's laughable. To sum it up it's about good ole Abe defeating the south and winning the civil war. Half of them are vampires in disguise. Blah blah blah..Abe wins and defeats the vamps..ie ending slavery too..huh???? Spending 2.99 at blockbuster on this thing was a waste. I should of give my 3 bucks to the homeless guy on my walk there. At least one of us would of been able to enjoy our spooky night! I give it a thumbs down, and will never look at a penny the same.",2,6,11,1 November 2012
