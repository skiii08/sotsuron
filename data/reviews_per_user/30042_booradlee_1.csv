Hereditary," A review of the reviews
","I'll start by stating that I am a huge horror/thriller fan. Honestly, just an all around movie fan in general. I used to obsess about movie 'magic' when I was a kid and wanted to work in makeup and set design when I got older. That still hasn't changed, but I now know it's an unrealistic goal. Anyways, I personally feel like I have a good eye for great cinematography and a great sense of what it takes to be a great actor and/or director. However, this is always subjective. Just like all of these reviews. 
I find it funny that while scrolling through the reviews I am seeing either 9's and 10's or 1's and 2's. There are no middle of the road reviews. It seems that you either love this movie or you hate this movie. Now I can sit here and speculate why people hate this movie. A lot of you cannot stand the slow pace that builds up to what you were hoping to be a super climactic ending. Perhaps this is because you are indoctrinated to expect fast paced thrills that build up to the ultimate ejaculatory climax? Or you are just bored easily because you grew up in this new world of vines and fast talking reality tv shows. Or maybe the overhyped expectation let you down? Who knows. 
All I know is that I loved it. It takes a lot to scare me anymore. I grew up in the 90's watching all the original zombie movies, creepy indie films, monster flicks, etc. I have grown numb to horror. The Exorcist was really the only movie that had me afraid of the dark. Specifically a dark staircase. But this movie was the first movie that literally made me sick to my stomach. *SPOILER* Perhaps it is only because I am now a father and the thought of my daughter receiving the same untimely death as theirs did, was too much for me? I have no idea. The more I think about it, I don't think I would have reacted the same back in highschool. But I can say that the audience in the theater with me seemed to enjoy it as much as we all did. I didn't share the same experience as it seems many of you did. Perhaps it's a regional phenomena? That seems ridiculous, but who knows. 
Anyways, I believe this is one of those movies that deserves a second and possibly a third viewing. I am currently watching it a second time and noticing things I didn't notice the first time, which is always a delight for me. I am also realizing that this is one of those movies that is supposed to leave you guessing at the end. Why do movies always have to have a conclusion? What is wrong with leaving people guessing? Isn't that life in a nutshell? I mean, clearly you see that the king of hell has now entered into human form. This is basically the birth of the anti-christ. You can pretty much guess what happens next if you know how that story plays out. 
My point is, not everyone is going to love this film. But don't tell people to stay away from it. Because it could inspire something in someone who is going to make the next great horror film. I'm sure a LOT of you waste 2 hours of your day arguing politics on facebook but you're telling people not to waste their time watching a movie that truly does have some great acting, some beautiful cinematography and some decent story telling? Again, it's all subjective. Watch the damn movie if you want to, with an open mind and then move on to the next moment in your life.",9,0,1,15 September 2018
