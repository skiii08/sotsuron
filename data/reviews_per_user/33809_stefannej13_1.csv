Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," There can only be ONE worst movie of ALL time and this is not it!
","I was a little skeptical about this movie at first, but you can not go and see this movie ready to pick it apart. Sometimes the joy of movies is just sitting back, relaxing, and picking up what they're putting out. And 'Borat' is nothing, but comedy and a few cringes here and there. I honestly there is nothing racist about it because it portrays America as America, and sometimes the best way to get over things is to laugh about them. 'Borat' gives you the perfect opportunity to do so. So many people call this movie 'The Worst Movie of All Time', but I label these people 'The Ones Afraid to Laugh.' These are the people who are always walking on their tippy toes, afraid they are going to offend someone, and are willing and able to defend any sex, race, or religion because of some kind of guilt complex. I'm on to you! Leave this movie alone.-Go rent Borat, its a 'good' different kind of comedy!",8,1,6,19 June 2007
