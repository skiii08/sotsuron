Blade Runner 2049," Better in every way.
","If the orginal Blade Runner is a cult classic, then this movie is probably the best sequel ever made for anything.It's stunning how good this is, the presentation was amazing, with some great shots and visual ideas with a heavy pack of creativity, the script was an improve in every way towards the original, all the performances were excellent with great emotion weight and every choice was well thought and incredibly fitting for the themes presented in the film.The best movie I saw in 2017, and an instant classic to be remembered for years to come.",10,3,9,3 October 2018
