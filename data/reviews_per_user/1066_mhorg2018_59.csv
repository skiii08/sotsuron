Blade Runner 2049," An unnecessary sequel
","There are some movies that get made that should never be diluted by a sequel. This movie is one of them. Following in the footsteps of his absolutely terrible Arrival (The aliens don't understand our concept of time. Five minutes later it's we'll be back for your help in 3000 years). Dennis Villaneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is too long, too dull and too derivative of the original. A sequel that's based on what I feel is a lame story line (which I can't give away simply because it's a major spoiler). While the look of the film is in line with the original, if not dirtier, the movie itself really goes nowhere. I can see why it bombed at the theaters. It really isn't for anyone who's not a fan of the original. It's another in Ridley Scott's recent line of failures (even though he only produced it. It want's to be a smart movie, but honestly, the only smart movie I've seen recently is Ex Machina, which was brilliant, something this movie isn't. There are parts that were interesting, but overall the entire film just plods from scene to scene. Ryan Gosling's inability to emote doesn't help this. Nor does waiting nearly 2/3rds of a too long run time for Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard to show up. I have to say that I wasn't looking forward to this film and now that I've seen it, I'm disappointed.",3,51,104,8 November 2017
Changeling," Excellent
","Excellent performances all around, especially by Angelia Jolie, who won't give up the search when her son is kidnapped. Her dismay and anger at the lack of interest by the police comes across quite true. Really a nerve wracking film.",8,2,4,1 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," While the prequels have their detractors, I'm not one of them.
","A good start to the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker and the birth of Darth Vader. A fun, if grim and at times humorless film, the weakest part is the kid who plays young Anakin. He's just not that good in the role, but honestly , George should have had someone like lawrence kasdan come in and tweak the script. If one hates writing, then why write? Still the look of the film clearly shows how it will evolve into the later movies, something other Prequels (like Enterprise, utterly fail at).",8,4,5,31 July 2018
The Finest Hours," Absolutely Terrible
","What a waste of film. Not only is this a terrible movie, but it's an insult to the actual event. I wondered, as I watched this, did the screenplay writers even bother to read the book? It's filled with so many factual errors (wrong type of engine room for one), that my entire review could be just about that. And let's talk about Webber, the coxwain, taking off his life jacket! No Coastie would ever do something so stupid. EVER. Let's add in an unnecessary love story that simply drags the movie down. Did the idiots at Disney think women wouldn't go see a movie about one of the greatest rescues in history if there wasn't a love story in it? This movie is just a poor effort, and I'm not surprised at all that it bombed at the movies.",1,20,38,4 June 2016
3:10 to Yuma," A remake I do like.
","Rather than simply ape the original (and thereby ruin this version), this one has a lot more action and since it's done now, a lot more violence. The story is still the same, a Rancher (Bale) promises to put the bad guy (Crowe) on a train to jail. Their interaction, as well as the son who doesn't respect dad Bale, is well done. Well worth seeing.",8,1,2,10 July 2018
Train to Busan," One of the most unique Zombie movies ever
","When I first heard of this, I sighed. Now Zombies on a train? But this is a really different film that shows the best and worst of humanity while trying to survive. When an outbreak of violence starts sweeping South Korea, A father (who has little time for her) and his daughter are, with others including a working man and his pregnant wife, a High School Baseball team and a CEO (the one stereotype in the movie) on a train. Before the train can leave, an injured woman staggers on. As the trains pulling out we see others attacked on the platform. For now the travelers are blissfully unaware... This is anything but an average zombie movie. Some may compare it to 28 Days Later (but those weren't zombies, they were infected and living). The zombies in this are unique in ways that I won't give away. They share more of a kinship with the terrible World War Z (this is a hundred times better)in their swarming ways. I would have thought that a movie set nearly entirely on a train would be slow, possibly boring - but it's not. Between moving at breakneck speed, this movie is claustrophobic and creepy. Well worth seeing.",8,1,4,10 March 2017
Amistad," Should be required viewing for students of American History.
","Brilliant film about slave who mutiny, slaughter most of the crew and up in America where John Quincy Adams defends them. Really a sad tale, not only does it show the evil's of slavery, but the evil's of man against man and how evilly we can treat one another. Anthony Hopkins is absolutely stellar as Adams and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. Really should be required viewing, especially in today's climate.",8,2,6,1 July 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Great Stand Alone
","Forget the naysayers. This movie, based on one paragraph in a new hope's crawl, is absolutely great. Yes, I know they had a female hero. So what? This shows the answer to the Rebel Spaceships, striking from a hidden base. How did those plans get nabbed? Who did they go to? The final battle over Scarif, as well as showing just how really relentless and evil the Empire is, as well as Vaders appearance at the end made this an instant classic. Just an excellent movie.",10,2,3,1 August 2018
Captain Marvel," Here's an honest review without all the fanboy hatred.
","Captain Marvel is one of the reasons I really hate fanboys. Late last night I signed on to IMDB.com and started reading reviews - 99 percent of which were full of hate and misogyny, an emotion that reigns among too many fans in the comic book world. Women characters are fine, until they become major characters - as back up's, sidekicks and romantic interests, they are fine - but let them take center stage and the hate comes oozing out. Now, I'll admit, I know little about this variant of Captain Marvel. My own interaction with CM was when the character was a man, Mar-Vell of the Kree (nice move with Annette Benning, especially the little homage where her hair went from blonde while she was on earth, to white when on Kree - a reversal of the first Captain Marvel, who, when he gained cosmic power, went from White to Blonde). So I went in open minded. I'll also admit surprise that the Skrulls - always bad guys when I was reading comic (and an original Fantastic Four villain at that!) were lightened up a bit. But reading other's reviews, I'm amazed at the utter hate, and wondering - what the hell movie did those pinheads see? It wasn't the one I sat through. Captain Marvel is a fun movie, with a great cast. I wish they would have gone for a little more character building for Carol Danvers - but her back story does get told and Brie Larson did a good job of playing the role. All this she can't emote garbage - well, haters are going to hate. I can do without their lame comments. Fans should remember that they support the characters - they don't own them (something Star Trek fans have never learned. If a franchise had to depend only on the diehard fans - well no franchise would exist today at all). So here's a little breakdown of Captain Marvel for those with open minds.
The Great: A beautiful opening homage to Stan Lee. Really touching and well thought out. I hope Avengers: Endgame opens the same way.
The good: The cast, the story, the action, the 90's. Harkening to Guardians with it's 70's and 80's tunes, this part of the soundtrack is great. I was especially surprised to hear a gone (I'm only Happy when it Rains) by Garbage, one of my favorite bands. Annette Benning and Ben Mendelsohn, as well as Jude Law give stellar performances. Those by the actresses playing Maria Rambeau (Lashanna Lynch, who I can HARDLY wait to see in Y, based on Y the Last Man!), and her daughter Monica (who will also bear the mantle of a Captain Marvel), played by Akira Akbar (This is Us) were great as well. The movie flows really quickly, barely giving the audience time to breath. They straightened out Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers was original Ms. Marvel in the 70's, with a much more revealing costume - but I'll be honest - that was a poorly written comic).
The Bad: As with most Marvel Movies, the music (not the songs, but the original music) is forgettable. They could have cut down some of the cute cat moments, there's enough of that on the internet. Other than that, not too many complaints.
My final comment is: What the hell is a flukken? Whatever this alien creature is (I won't say who) I hope I never meet one on a dark night. And for the comically inept - that's a joke.",7,1,3,8 March 2019
Coraline," Brilliant
","From the mind of Neil Gaiman comes Coraline, a sweet and beautiful stop motion movie about a little girl who moves into a new home and discovers a secret world on the other side. Featuring an awesome voice cast, this is a simply beautiful film that begs to be watched again and again.",9,0,0,5 July 2018
Passengers," Barely Science Fiction and a waste of leads
","Some have called this 'A rape fantasy' (incorrect), a Stockholm Syndrome film (maybe) and Creepy (in parts). I call it mostly dull, since it drags in parts and barely science fiction (for reasons since I don't want to write spoilers, I won't go into depth). But there's barely any science to the science fiction - as any sf fan who watches this - especially the reactor vent scene - will see. While the leads are good together, I found the story un-involving and the premise as well as the sappy ending, silly. With a little work this could have been really good, but as it is, it's barely worth watching once. I keep hoping Hollywood would simply allow a great sf movie like Ex Machina to be made, but they keep failing the viewer and then wring their hands, wondering what went wrong.",3,1,4,14 February 2017
Zootopia," Funny
","The story of Judy Hop, a rabbit who wants to be a cop and foils a huge drug gang in her city, the voice cast alone is worth seeing it for. There are a lot of great gags in this, from the Sloths working at the DMV, to a really funny Breaking Bad joke, this is certainly worth seeing.",8,2,2,5 July 2018
Hostel," Utter, worthless trash.
","Eli Roth is one of the worst directors in the world. I'd rather watch something by Uwe Boll or the major hack, Shymalan twice than watch any garbarge this unimaginative, loser of a director puts on cinema. How this movie, this horrible, terrible, unimaginative film even got oked, well this is probably one of the reasons there are so many remakes and bad movies. The money people think the audience will pay to see anything. Violence and gore for violence and gore sake does not make a good movie. This is a prime example.",1,0,1,23 April 2020
Balls of Fury," Turn off your brain and have fun
","I gave this a 4 because it could and should have been way funnier. Basically a Kung Fu pastiche, but with Ping Pong in place of Kung Fu, some of the jokes and situations are very funny and some are not. Worth seeing once.",4,0,0,8 July 2018
The Terminator," Low Budget means nothing.
","Before James Cameron's ego ran rampant, this was one of the great films (the other being Aliens) that he made. A simple story of time travel, with a soldier and a killing machine from the future, coming back to accomplish disparate tasks: the soldier to save, the machine to kill, the mother of the futures savior. A brilliant film, sparse and quick, it keeps the viewer glued to the screen and again, in the pre CGI days, the limited amount of effects are simply amazing. The movie that set Arnold on his career path, and made Cameron one to be noticed. Just great.",10,1,3,15 June 2018
Gettysburg," Brilliant
","Based on the incomparable 'The Killer Angels', this is not only one of the greatest civil war movies ever, but simply a great movie. Excellently cast, directed, filmed, the music helps the movie as well. While some may nitpick all they want, it's as closer to the actual battle as can be. Simply worth watching again & again.",10,2,2,17 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A decent ending to the first trilogy.
","The highlight of this movie is of course, Lukes battle with Vader. It shows how the young Jedi has grown, as well as the point where he could destroy what's left of his father, and doesn't. Palpatine is quite evil and easy to not like, and the space battles are as usual, brilliant. The Ewoks show Lucas fear of technology and he uses them to show that nature wins over technology. (Reminds me of Tolkien who also feared technology). A fun movie I only wish the scene where Luke builds his new lightsaber was left in.",8,0,0,31 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A fine ending for the beginning.
","Ignore the haters.
Ignore rotten tomatoes.
Even ignore a lot on IMDb.
Think for yourself.
This is a great ending to this series. The cat is excellent, as is the story. There are even a few twists that no one saw coming. The ending is very satisfying.",10,10,23,21 December 2019
Pacific Rim," An overly expensive Gamera movie with a terrible story.
","I'm really surprised that Del Toro created this garbage. Average story, monsters that looked like they were stolen (oh sorry, 'homaged') from the 1960's Gamera movies (especially the Knife nosed monsters), the only good thing I can say about this is it was slightly better than the last fifteen Transformers movies - all of which seemed to be the same movie. (That's sarcasm kids). A waste of a good cast, spouting platitudes that have been said in too many other movies. The 'action' scenes mostly at night or in the rain, were dull and unimaginative. Finally the final scene was a rip off of Independence Day. If I never see this again, it will be too soon.",1,2,3,19 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Beginning of the end of the Republic
","My second favorite in the Prequel Trilogy, it moves faster than the first. We have a forbidden love, the birth of the Grand Army of the Republic - made of clones. The Separatists and their droid army, as well as the plans of the nefarious Count Dooku, assistant to the evil Palpatine who's plans are all coming together. The beginning of the fall of Anakin Skywalker. We get to see the Jedi at the height of their power, and their utter failure to recognize evil at their own doorstep. A very entertaining film.",9,1,2,1 August 2018
Oblivion," Excellent
",A fine movie where the earth has been invaded by an alien A.I. that conquered earth using clones of an astronaut. One of his clones constantly questions and is seeking the truth of his existence. Well done apocalyptic film with a fine cast.,9,3,4,27 July 2018
Man of Steel," Man of Steel soars!
","For me, this is a perfect Superman movie. I can relate to the character since they've given him a humanness lacking in other versions. No film before this has ever shown the problems he had adjusting to his powers. It was hey I have powers, time to be Superman. Amy Addams is my favorite Lois Lane and her relationship with Superman is perfect. I won't say why I feel this since it would be a spoiler. The cast is simply excellent. The entire Krypton part of the film, with Jor-El as a man of mind and action, and Zod's belief that he is the guardian of the Kryptonian race, was brilliant. In other films, as far as villains what do we get; Superman fights a missile, one of which he can't even catch. The Villains in 2 were horrid, with powers that Kryptonians don't have. 3 and 4 aren't even worth mentioning. Returns got the powers right, but again, Lex Luthor? I hope luthor stays a background or tertiary villain until at least Man of Steel 3. The movie. I loved the way it was set up, with an adult Clark Kent wandering the earth committing acts of goodness. Then when he discovers his heritage and the family shield meaning hope. All excellent, well done ideas. Some have complained about the end. What does the viewer expect when two Kryptonians battle? To duke it out over a chess board? This was as near perfect a Superman movie as one could be and I am looking forward to the sequel. Henry Cavill is officially my favorite Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. And Amy Addams was a great Lois Lane, she carried her role well. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Superman. P.S. I loved the costume and am glad the undies are gone.",10,0,3,24 June 2013
The Revenant," Overrated
","While this film does contain some beautiful performances and cinematography, that's about it. The spirit of human nature has been done before. While the DiCaprio character's survival is amazing - the film bogs down a bit as he crawls and finally walks out of his predicament. Decent, but not a film that I'd need to see again.",7,1,3,5 July 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A Brilliant Sequel
","Cameron strikes again. Before his Ego and two billion dollar earning movies turned him into a bit of a prat, Cameron made this movie. He turned things on their head by having two Terminators come back, one programmed to be good, the other programmed to be a killer. The T1000 is amazing with its morphing abilities. Unlike the stupid TX from T3, which could create all kinds of weapons, the T1000 is a weapon. As long as it can stab or grab. It's grounded in physics of reality. The action is this is even crazier than Terminator, but then it had a budget twenty times larger. A brilliant movie that's endlessly watchable.",10,0,4,15 June 2018
Aliens," This is what makes a sequel great.
","Entirely different from Alien, which was basically a gothic horror in space, Aliens is a brilliant war movie in space, the protagonists Humans and the hideous aliens (which basically, are born by rape). Featuring a super tight story with excellent direction, the cast makes this movie. When I saw it was still in the US Coast Guard. When Hudson is moaning about being short, you could tell all the military in the audience by their understanding moans in return. It starts out slowly and then explodes with action and violence. The aliens, hive like, are just as frightening as in the original. The extended version is even better than the original cut. I really wish Cameron would have directed Starship Troopers.",10,1,3,15 June 2018
Dallas Buyers Club," Decent
","Decent movie about a guy who, on discovering he's got AIDS, and that the government has way too many legal hurdles, cuts out the middle man and starts helping others with drugs that people can't get due to government interference.",6,0,2,1 July 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Could have used some editing
","I've been reading comics for over 50 years, and honestly, I was never an Avengers fan of the comics. In film, well that's a totally different story. While this was a good movie, I really feel it was too long. It could have used some editing. It was paced quite differently from any other Marvel movie, leaving most of the action until the end and that's where it lost me. They killed off the wrong characters. Two of them were the most popular ones for me. There would have been more Pathos had they made different choices. I'm not going to spoil this for anyone and say who was killed off, that would be simply rude. But it makes me wonder, has Marvel, after 22 movies, run it's course? Will Disney's need for PC ruin Phase 4? Let's face it, Disney is all about money. Their cancelling of their agreement with Netflix was a terrible one. No more Punisher or Daredevil? (I couldn't really care about Iron Fist or Defenders and I think the way Luke Cage ended was terrible, but I'd have liked to see him again). So Phase Three is over. What's next for Marvel? I'm not looking forward to The Eternals but I am looking forward to Shang-Chi. So overall, I give this an 8. I knew a few characters were going to get killed, but there weren't really any big surprises in it. Did anyone really think Black Panther, after making a billion dollars was going to stay dead?",7,1,2,30 April 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Desolation of Filler is more like it.
","Some have been overly gracious in their praise of this film. I will not be. I've been reading Tolkien since 1976, when I first read The Hobbit. While I did enjoy the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which Jackson got about 80 percent right, I found this, a result of the greed of the studio and Jackson and his co-writers egos, unacceptable. It was boring, overlong and had just too much filler. Tauriel is unnecessary. Read the books - no Elven women fight. This is far too much of a stretch. Then to have a love triangle between two elves and a dwarf? Unacceptable. No elf or dwarf have EVER been lovers or in love. If Tolkien didn't write it, Jackson shouldn't have included it. Adding stuff from the appendixes was a great idea, but the whole scene was done poorly. And Beorn, a major character, used in a cameo? I was disappointed beyond words in this movie. Overblown and under thought, with a horrible ending (likely because of all the unnecessary filler), this wasn't anything like the great two part film the Hobbit should have been. And, among Jackson's many crimes against The Hobbit, he totally ruined the barrel escape. Oh and Azog is dead by the time of the Hobbit. DEAD. His son, Bolg leads the Orcs of the misty mountains. I could go on, but why bother? I'm not even looking forward to the last part. And I can only imagine what the EXTENDED version of this mess will look like on DVD. Imagine is all I can do, since I'm not going to buy it. Addendum: I notice nothing Jackson has done since the Lord of the Rings has been worth squat.",1,7,10,23 January 2014
Batman Begins," The Beginning of the Greatest Superhero Trilogy ever.
","It's simple. This is the beginning of the best Superhero Trilogy of all time. Nothing can touch these three, beginning right here. (And as they unfold it's clear how tightly they mesh together). Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson... the only weak spot in this movie (and the next) is Rachel Dawes. Especially here, with squeaky voiced Katie Hughes as the characters. But that doesn't detract from this being a great movie. The flow, direction and story are all excellent.",10,0,0,12 July 2018
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The best of a worthless, unecessary Trilogy
","This is the only one of the three films that shows the screenwriters might have read the book. Bilbo, Gandalf, the Shire, the unexpected party are all done well. And then the bottom drops out. How is Azog alive? Azog was killed by the Dwarves decades earlier at the battle of Khazadum, in response for him killing Thror. Where is Beorn? For every one good scene, there are five stupid things in this insult of a movie. How does one make a 300 page book into 9 hours of movie? Useless filler that's how. But this was the truest to the book, unlike its followups.",5,1,3,30 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Since I cannot turn off my brain, I couldn't enjoy this utterly stupid movie.
","As a science fiction fan for more than 50 years, it constantly annoys me that Hollywood movies annoy the crap out of me. For every great film such as The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951, not that horrible remake), there's a film the critics (who don't know crap about Science Fiction evidently) adore like 'A Quiet Place.' Some really good performances are totally wasted in a film so loaded with plot holes as to be ridiculous. The movie starts long after a disaster takes place. Pay attention and there are some clues dropped. Apparently these hunter aliens got here on a meteor that lands in Mexico. In a matter of no time they are found to be blind, hungry and indestructible. They run rampant across the world, with one of the headlines of a paper screaming GET UNDERGROUND. Skip ahead to a family, all walking barefoot (what, there's nothing to step on that'll make a sound? Can the monsters discern between sounds of nature and unnatural sounds? They never really make this clear.) Anyhow, their youngest kid, about 4, who they don't look out for at all, finds a toy. Pop takes it away, removes the batteries and leaves it sitting there. They all leave, the older sister - naturally deaf - gives it to the kid. He takes the batteries, and while they return home - the littlest kid about 50 yards behind EVERYONE ELSE, manages to get the batteries back in - turns it on and gets killed. This is in the first five minutes. Anyhow, more stupidity abounds. They have unlimited electricity, but it's never shown - do they have a generator? Likely not, hte monsters would tear it apart. Solar Panels? We don't know. Even though dad has a big note that says SOUNDPROOF - they've done nothing other than throw a mattress over the entrance to the root cellar. They also have tons of corn. Who planted it? Who's going to harvest it? How without making noise? Turns out mom is Pregnant! Why? Did she get pregnant before the disaster happened? We don't know and by now I didn't care. Everyone ends up separated by the end, with two kids being hunted in a corn silo, Mom trapped in their home which is being flooded (how? Beats me.) she steps on a nail but doesn't scream, and then gives birth. First she drops enough blood to die of blood loss. Dad gives his life to save the kids, who escape as he's being killed in a truck that rolls down hill (doesn't make any noise). A monster shows up BUT the daughter has learned that her cochlear implant lets out a frequency (something the governments, scientists, and military of THE ENTIRE WORLD couldn't figure out? Hey, these monsters hunt by sound - let's use SONAR on them! Nope. Took these losers to do this.) And while the mom should be nearly dead from blood loss and birth exhaustion, she gets a shotgun and while daughter blasts the sound from another hearing aid into a mike, blows the 'indestructible' monsters head off, killing it. The movie then ends with mom ratcheting the shotgun while daughter prepares to blast the hearing aid into the mike again, while on their closed circuit cameras (again tons of electricity) about 400 monsters are coming.
There are so many stupid ideas in this movie it overcomes the one good idea; monsters who hunt by sound (an idea partially lifted from Pitch Black, and the monsters have a similar look). There's a waterfall they visit so they can talk and yell (gee, why not live by it?).Why not take a bluetooth speaker, set it up far away on top of oh, I don't know - EXPLOSIVES - play it and blow these bastards up? I don't buy that whole indestructible baloney. They aren't Godzilla. Also, why aren't we ever poisonous to alien life forms? They take a bite and drop dead. Guess that would make for a short damn movie. I really can't see what made people go Gaga over this, since it was slow, boring and illogical. I see there's going to be a sequel. But I won't be seeing it.",1,38,78,4 July 2018
Patton," Still worth seeing.
","This biopic of the overbearing, brilliant General has a great cast, and a great director. Highlighting most of the highs and Lows of Patton's career, even with some flaws (like the tanks), it's still worth watching. While Scott dominates the screen as Patton, keep an eye on Karl Malden as Bradley - he steals every scene he's in. Worth all the accolades it received.",8,2,3,19 June 2018
Coco," I didn't think they could outdo UP
","First, I don't love every single Pixar movie. Some I found dull and uninteresting, really made more for kids than a general audience, then there's movies like Coco. Simply brilliant. From the cast to the look (astoundingly beautiful in the Land of the Dead), to the music and songs. From beginning to end it was simply a breathtaking, totally absorbing, beautiful movie. Pixar should suck up a few more Oscars on this one. The one thing I could have really done without was the lame Olaf from Frozen short. Boring and uninspired, I'd rather have seen a few more trailers. But Coco is a gem in the crown that is Pixar.",10,2,5,5 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A worthy sequel
","I like Rian Johnson. He did great work on Breaking Bad, the best TV show of the last twenty years, and did great work here. The saber battle at the end is exciting and brilliant and the story flows. People complained about the chase, and that we finally find out that the ships don't run on wishes, but those kind of fans, who feel it necessary to attack the actress who played Rose Tico, well they should go back to hiding under stones. This was a fun exciting movie and there was a fine chemistry between Luke and Rey as teacher-student. The cameo by Yoda was awesome and welcome. My advice to people who take Star Wars far too seriously is this: sit back and enjoy or simply shut up and go away.",10,11,44,31 July 2018
The Dark Knight," Part of the Greatest Superhero Trilogy ever.
","Nolan's take on Batman is simply, the most realistic, best directed and written, best acted and most enjoyable of all the Superhero movies, be it DC or Marvel. All the other movies must look up to these. And of the three, this is the best. Heath Ledger is the greatest joker ever (sorry Mark) leaving Nicholson's version in the dust. Christian Bale is the best Batman. And the rest of the cast is simply great. This might be the best movie Aaron was ever in and his Two Face is chilling. The supporting cast is also amazing. Just not single bad thing to say about this. I can watch it over and over.",10,0,0,2 July 2018
Alice in Wonderland," Terrible.
","Some of Tim Burton's movies (Edward Scissorhands, The Corpse Bride, Sleepy Hollow), I really like. Then there's this mess. Boring lead, overblown sfx, it just isn't a good movie. Watch the Disney cartoon instead (even though that's not as dark as the story, just Disnifeyed).",1,0,1,10 July 2018
La La Land," Overrated
","Much like Arrival, which the critics went gaga over and was a drama disguised as a science fiction film, the critics went gaga over this as well. Perhaps if they'd had some musically inclined people in it, rather than the cast they did, it might have kept my attention. But it didn't. I find Ryan Gosling bland, and really while I like Emma, she needs to stretch her acting muscles. The big eyed earnest waif act is wearing a bit thin. Her character in this could have been her character from Easy A, there's that little of a difference. Some critics have compared this to Singin in the Rain, but there is no comparison. That's a classic and this is just another over-hyped Hollywood movie. I'm sure some people love it. But I'm pretty sure just as many didn't.",1,51,104,26 February 2017
Where Eagles Dare," A bit too long
","While this is considered a 'Men's Movie', it a bit too long and too dull in parts. It's also full of inaccuracies such as the Germans having a Helicopter. Clint Eastwood as a stone killer is the first best part of this, Ingrid Pitt is the second best. While it's worth watching once in a while, it's not a classic in any way.",5,1,7,28 July 2018
The Shape of Water," A Beautiful poem to Monster Kids
","Guillermo Del Toro mentioned that one of the driving ideas behind this was for the monster to get the girl. I'm not going to give this away, but unlike some of the naysayers who've damned this film, they obviously didn't watch it with their eyes open. Who can make a film like this for under 20 million these days? Obviously Guillermo can. This is a dark and beautiful fantasy that one has to pay attention to. The story flows like the water it contains and I can't single out any one performance since all of them are so excellent. I would have liked it if the Amphibian man had a little more original look. He looked like Abe Sapien with the creature from the black lagoon's hands. But he is a beautiful creature, streamlined and wonderful. While some may poo-poo this film, It's Del Toro's best original film since Pan's Labyrinth and far superior to either Crimson Peak and the utterly terrible Pacific Rim.",8,68,130,19 February 2018
War of the Worlds," One of the worst remakes ever
","First; this isn't a rethinking (a word I'm totally sick of) of the original
film, nor is it a true adaptation (even updated) of the classic novel. What it
is, honestly, is a post 9/11 mish-mosh that plays on peoples fears as well
as lifting the best parts from the book and the 1953 film, while adding a
silly and contrived sub-plot.So where do we start? Like this: The Good: The SFX was spectacular. The scenes of destruction were absolutely beautiful. The War machines were awesome (and a bit of a nod to the old Classics Illustrated version); the aliens were somewhat original, but reminded me of the creatures from ID4 for some reason, and they had the hands of the Martians from the 1953 version. One of the end scenes is an homage to the end of the original film.Other good: The ferry being flipped by the Tripod as it crosses the Hudson was right out of the novel. Of course in the Novel the
Steamram, Thunderchild destroys that Tripod by ramming it. Also earlier in the
book artillery fire destroys a Martian capsule before they can build their tripod. (See the bad for more on
this).The Bad: David Koepp and Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of themselves
for allowing this crappy story to see daylight. The 9/11 references are way too
plentiful. As someone who watched it unfold from my home and had to wash the
ash of the burning Towers off my car, I found this irresponsible and unnecessary. Can't one simply make a great SF movie (see original War of the Worlds for an example) without beating the audience over the head with symbolism reminding us of a real event? Another thing, the whole Tom Cruise as divorced dad was so damned contrived as to be silly. What, a single person isn't going to want to survive this kind of horror as much as a married person? Also the kids had no personality. The son was a bland, anti-Dad kind of guy, all Dakota Fanning did was stare and scream. This whole aspect of the plot just bored me. If Koepp was adapting/updating the book, then why did the aliens have shields, ala the 1953 version? In the book the Tripods are tough, but 19th century weapons bring two down. Also the scene where Gene Barry chops off one of the aliens spy devices (on a long neck) is lifted for this film. Hey dudes, that didn't happen in the book, ok? Finally, if these aliens had been here for millions of years, having planted their war machines, why the hell didn't they think to test our air and water? Yes, the ending is right out of the book with the aliens dying of Terran bacteria, but it makes no sense. In the original film and book, there was no preparation time, the aliens landed and started blasting us out of existence. So these aliens, who have some kind of
Transporter technology, didn't have the brains to check things out first? Were these cousins to the morons from Signs, who came to a planet 70 percent water (which they were ALLERGIC to) so they could die?The Ugly; At the beginning, when the aliens are riding lightning down to
Earth, all electrical power shuts off. How was this one guy able to freaking
take pictures with his camcorder? Also, can someone explain the physics of a
heat ray that dissolves human beings but doesn't destroy their clothing? This
was a very heavy handed parallel to the deaths on 9/11, which was unnecessary. A further point, Cruises son goes to watch the military take on the aliens,
the entire brigade is wiped out - yet his son survives to make it to an
untouched (mostly Boston). In fact at the very laughable end, Cruise and his
daughter make it to Boston, see the machines start to topple and fall. Cruise
notices birds sitting on the one machine (another homage to the book, where the astronomer sees the birds feeding on the dead Martians), yet trained military
men don't? He notices the shield is down? And when he gets to his ex-wife's
parents home, the block is untouched. Looks like a Sunday morning. And his son
is there, it looks like they've all been wakened from breakfast! (And this isn't Boston, its Carroll Gardens, in Brooklyn, New York. A total nitpick, but they spent 100 million plus and couldn't afford to film in Boston?). This was just a silly excuse for a 'message' film, that failed to give me any message at all, other than Steven Spielberg shouldn't be allowed to do SF. A.I. stunk, Minority Report was a joke and if I never see this again, well I'll be pretty damn content. The original film was much better and probably had 1/100th of the budget. The difference is the original film and book both entertain without beating a reader/watcher over the head, while this ham-handed mistake of a film doesn't.",1,2,3,20 June 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Worthless ending to an unnecessary trilogy.
","Garbage. Overlong and an insult to the book. This proves that the screenwriters might have read the book and said, oh screw this. We can do better. Well guess what? You couldn't. You blew it by making it a trilogy. You blew it by ruining the entire Bard vs Smaug scene. You blew it with the stupid love triangle. You blew it in every way possible. Just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. I will never watch any of these ever again.",1,5,8,30 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Fall of the Republic and the Rise of the Empire
","My favorite of the Prequels. The movies flies along giving us the fall of Anakin to the dark side. The end of the Jedi. The rise of the Empire. Order 66. Luke (he's the oldest!) and Leia. Great battles, including two of the best light saber duels in the entire series. This ends on a low note but is the best of the Prequels.",10,2,3,1 August 2018
Arrival," Simply put - Overrated
","Movie critics are notorious when it comes to Science Fiction movies. They usually abhor it so, when any SF movie becomes a critic's darling as this one did - I get worried. And once again, my worry meter proved true. This is a glacially slow, at times, dull film that really wastes a good cast. The story really makes no sense, other than it shows how someone can deal with loss. The SF elements are really unnecessary. I don't want to give anything away so I won't give away the big reveal. Amy Adams is great, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are good. The design of the aliens is really original (think a tree crossed with a squid and a starfish). But there just isn't enough to this film. We never really learn anything about the aliens, but plenty about human fear (which is something any SF fan already knows about). The story is just disjointed. And the ending was far from shocking in any way. In fact, I haven't seen an ending for a movie that dragged this much since A.I. It was a nice effort with some decent sfx, but other than that, there isn't much to this movie.",3,5,11,19 November 2016
Halloween," Didn't do anything for me.
","The idea of the indestructible boogey man is one like found footage movies and unnecessary remakes, that I wish would go away. While the acting is good and the directing is decent, the movie itself didn't frighten me or put on the edge of my seat. I actually found it a bit boring and just ok. The endless sequels and remakes to this have been mostly worthless and I'm sure that the idea of Michael Myers popping up everywhere, had a huge influence on the Friday the 13ths, Jason.",5,0,1,8 July 2018
Wonder Woman," Magnificent!
","Wonder Woman â€“ My review.Wonder Woman has gotten a lot of accolades. It's the best reviewed DC universe movie of them all and rightly so â€“ since it's the best. In fact, I'd put it up there just below the Nolan Batman Trilogy. It's that good. First, the casting. All the main players and the minors are very good in their role. But Gal Gadot brings Princess Diana to life. She is at once a warrior, an innocent, full of heart and amazement. Her action scenes whether it's lasso, sword and shield or fists are great. She is one of the best representations of a superhero on film ever. Patty Jenkins has done a superb job bringing this movie to life. Chris Pine and Gal have great chemistry together. And Lucy Davis as Etta Candy is really fun. Can't have a Wonder Woman film without her sidekick. The story flows organically and moves very nicely. The editing is great and the WW1 sets are breath taking. Really, really great set design. But in the end, like any Superhero movie, it's the main character that carries it. Gal brings a sincerity and believability to the role and makes it hers. I'm already looking forward to WW2. Cheetah maybe?",10,12,30,2 June 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Brilliant ending to the greatest Superhero Trilogy ever
","Simply the best Super Hero trilogy movie ever. And this, the conclusion to it, is absolutely stunning. Simply a great movie, from the cast, to the story to the ending which always chokes me up. I never get tired of any of these three movies and all other trilogies are looking up at these.",10,1,2,12 July 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Time to retire this series
","While the first and second movies were fun, this one is tired. Same old joke, (Rebel Wilson needs to do something new) and the underdogs win theme is boring now. The best part, as in the previous entries are Elizabeth Banks and her co-commentator. Just always funny.",3,3,7,28 March 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Brilliant and touching
","Taika really knocks it out of the park with one of the finest satires ever made. Think of the song, 'Springtime for Hitler', extended into a beautiful, funny, touching film. Jojo is a little boy, raised in Nazi Germany, whose imaginary best friend is Adolf Hitler (played hysterically by Taika, the funniest Hitler since Dick Shawn in The Producers). But he learns that Nazism isn't everything... I won't say anymore other than see this movie.",8,1,2,3 February 2020
Midway," Good movie with a few glaring errors.
","First, the cast was great, especially Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz. The Battle scenes and the movie itself, were far superior to the 76 version, and they left out the lame love story. The two biggest errors were: Wade McCluskey loses his bomb due to an electrical arming error in his dauntless (he was also a dauntless pilot, but they did Hollywood it up a bit), and they never once showed an American fighter, which is a glaring omission. The F4F Wildcat was the fleet fighter at the time. Both it and the horrible Brewster Buffalo (flying from Midway) should have been present. The torpedo hitting a Japanese ship and failing was totally true, in fact, one broke up and floated, enabling Japanese sailors to use it to be rescued. This was thanks to the penny pinching of the US government before the war. Some authors I'll suggest are, Prange, Lord and Symonds if anyone wants to know more.",8,61,105,8 November 2019
The Producers," The original!
","Mel Brooks had to be insane when he thought of this crazy idea. Make a losing play, keep the investors money and be rich. What could go wrong? Since this is Mel Brooks, ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Kenneth Mars and Dick Shawn are insane in this. The Springtime for Hitler bit is one of the funniest and craziest songs (and scenes) ever. I dare anyone not to laugh themselves sick during this entire movie. It's that damn funny.",9,2,3,19 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great new start, brought out the worst in many fans.
","This movie was fun. From beginning to end, it was a good way to jump start the star wars franchise. While I'm not a JJ Abrams fan at all, and can't stand his Star Trek movies, I also don't like his habit of let's do it because it's cool and never explain a thing, this was a fun movie. The new characters are tremendous and the only complaint I have is that it really brought out the worst in Star Wars fans. There's no such thing as black stormtroopers! How the hell does anyone know that? (I would have liked to know why they stopped using clones). Why a female jedi hero? Why the hell not? Just sit back and enjoy the movie or shut up.",10,6,39,31 July 2018
Life," Promising opening for a movie that fails in the end.
","If you've seen Alien, then this movie will seem very familiar. Mars probe returns with Martian life on it and after being prodded, everything goes wrong. Sound familiar? It is, except in this case, the movie utterly fails in the end with a terribly predictable ending. The characters are cookie cutters and just watching you'll know whose going to die. The Japanese Astronaut's wife just had a baby, the American is a cold woman who came up with the firewall protocol, Ryan Reynolds is his usual one dimensional wise cracking self. The Alien itself is quite lovely to begin with and an original design. But everything here is an unoriginal, paint by the numbers movie. There are a few goofs as well such as only intermittently seeing the characters breath when the station goes cold. This could have been a great movie, instead it's a if I never see it or think of it ever again, I'll be fine. The theater I saw it in was empty, and reading some of these reviews, I'm wondering if the critics and viewers saw the same tired movie I did. It did have a few moments of intensity, but these were undermined by the pedestrian story.",1,13,31,25 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Put SciFi back on the movie map!
","Star Wars came around at the right time. People were feeling down and needing something fun to take their minds off the late 70's which were a crummy time. Star Wars blasts across the screen from the opening shot (still amazing today) to the final. And if there had never been another movie, that would have been ok simply because this is so great. But it gave birth to a phenomenon and for that , I am totally thankful. Just a great, enjoyable, wonderful movie.",10,1,1,31 July 2018
300," If you're looking for reality, skip this. If the goal is entertainment - See it!
","One of the most visually stunning movies of the 2000's, Zack Snyder's adaptation of Frank Millers '300' graphic novel, is brilliant. It's nearly a scene for scene adaptation of the brilliant graphic novel. The casting is excellent, as for history... Well, the 300 did make their stand at Thermopylae, but it was nothing like this. I'm not going to take anything away from this fantasy version of history. It's not meant to be taken seriously, but to entertain the viewer. And it does. And if it makes people seek our the real story - that's even better.",10,2,4,21 June 2018
Annihilation," Undecided
","Much like the cattle overated blade runner 2049, I found this movie tedious to get through. That it's intelligent, there is no don't. But I felt no connection with the characters. And what story there is explains virtually nothing. There are a lot of plot. Why an all female ram? Did they get weapons training before seeing it? Natalie was in the military, so that was explained. I'm a little tired of movies that take the viewer along to a nowhere ride. I much prefer Ex Machina.",3,14,33,12 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the greatest sequels of all time
","I hold this movie up with the first greatest sequel of all time, The Bride of Frankenstein. Simply a great, and breathtaking movie from the opening battle on Hoth to the great reveal by Vader (which I still won't mention here). The story flows brilliantly and is a more than worth successor, and in some ways is better, that A New Hope. One of the best movies of the 1980's and beyond.",10,0,0,31 July 2018
Spectre," I wanted to love this...
","I don't see why the critics went so gaga over this. As a follow up to Skyfall, this falls very short of the mark. Craig seems tired as Bond, as if he's done with the roll. Monica Bellucci, for all the talk of her as the oldest Bond girl, served in virtually a throw away roll, Seydoux was a particularly unlikable heroine, and the story, while it does have a lot of homages to previous bonds, doesn't feel that original. I did like the shout out to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, one of my very favorite Bond movies, but overall, this just felt average. Of course, following up Skyfall, one of the greatest Bond's ever had to be difficult, but this felt like it should have been so much more.",5,10,20,25 November 2015
Alien: Covenant," Utter Trash
","So 20th Century Fox thought that a half-assed neo-remake of Alien was a good idea? Everything about this movie from the opening which continues from the absolutely horrible Prometheus, to the characters doing every stupid thing in the book - is terrible. And I won't go into the obvious, stupid ending. Ridley Scott has lost it. I don't know or care why, but Fox needs to either let the Alien franchise die - or let Neil Blokamp, who has yet to do a movie I don't like, continue on with his vision for the Alien world. Why eggs if people can be infecting by spores? And why do only some get infected by the spores? Another stupid idea: How comes ships that were built to TRAVEL through space, can constantly have their port holes, windshields, whatever smashed open by aliens who then NOTHING happens to? Well, as long as Ridley Scott is involved with Aliens - I won't be. Sad to see him collapse this way.",1,21,38,10 June 2017
The Island," Decent
","Really just a high budget remake of Parts: The Clonus Horror, the cast makes this work. Action packed, with some missing bits of logic, I could easily see a bunch of rich humps running a secret facility full of their clones to keep them alive through organ transplants. It's fun to watch, just don't expect much in the way of logic.",7,1,1,4 July 2018
