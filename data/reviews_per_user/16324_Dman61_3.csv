3:10 to Yuma," Looked ridiculous to me (some spoilers)
","Misguided by this movie's high IMDb rating and an impressive cast, I made a mistake of spending $1.07 and two hours of my time watching it. About every plot twist was ridiculous. Seeing Ben Wade killing one guard after another going unpunished, a one-legged man running on the roofs like agents in 'The Matrix', a bulletproof protagonist, a criminal risking his life desperately trying to get TO jail, several other characters' decisions contradicting common sense and yet presented in the movie as smart and 'strategic' - made me either laughing hysterically or nauseous. A movie like this would make a good 'over-the-top' parody on westerns, similar to what Tarantino and Rodriguez did in 'Kill Bill' and 'Grindhouse' but I am afraid this wasn't the intention of the director; instead he was seriously and sincerely trying to make a typical western... and that is SO SAD! So unless you are a western junkie who doesn't care about holes in the plot or lack of common sense in characters' actions, avoid this movie at all costs. I think watching it made me dumber so please don't follow my example! On a brighter note: the soundtrack is good, and so are some performances. Ben Foster was very good... Christian Bale is good, too; Russell Crowe is, well, usual.",3,3,7,23 February 2008
Match Point," What's the point in a movie like this?
","Frankly, I don't see a point in making a movie like this. The main theme of it is extremely old and boring and was exhausted maybe 20 years ago. There were no performances that would make this movie memorable, either. For an hour and a half I was asking myself, 'Why should I care?' (still don't know the answer, by the way) and 'When is this going to end?'. With very few exceptions, the dialog is terrible and so is the narrative, very schematic, predictable, and full of stereotypes. I couldn't believe Woody Allen wrote and directed this.So it was, extremely boring and uninspiring, until the plot took a twist in the last thirty minutes. Then there were indeed a few non-stereotypical turns some of which I enjoyed (and they are the only reason I give this movie a 6 instead of a 3) but overall, was this last half an hour worth waiting, dying from boredom in the meantime? Definitely no if you ask me.",6,1,6,19 November 2006
Mulholland Drive," Full of magic
","I started watching this film completely unprepared and it blew me away. The magic of everything about this movie, from the twists of the plot to acting to camera work is simply amazing... I watched it all over that same night and then two more times the next day and still loved it. Only later did I learn about David Lynch and his other work so now I can see where all this came from. I did feel there was something fishy about the acting in the first part of the movie but after the plot took that unexpected twist, everything fell in place... Well, almost everything... Well, no, not really. Lynch leaves much to viewers to make sense of. If you prefer the type of movies where at the end you get all the answers, then stay away from this one. It left me searching for clues and interpretations which I am leaving out to avoid spoilers. The tag line for this movie may have well been 'Nothing is what it seems to be'... or wait, did I steal it from somewhere? It did remind me a lot of 'Memento', one of my all-time favorites, although I am pretty sure they were conceived independently.One more thing. (I should start with that, really.) Naomi Watts' talent is unbelievable! The way she transforms several (I counted six or seven) times in this movie, transforms literally beyond recognition, is absolutely amazing. The way she looks at Camilla as they walk uphill towards the party... and then her face at the party... and almost immediately at the diner... And her audition earlier in the movie?! Oh. My. God. I know of few actresses who can be this versatile. If you know her only from 'The Ring' and 'King Kong', you gotta see her in this one.",9,2,3,2 January 2006
