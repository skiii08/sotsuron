Your Name.," Just OK
","This isn't the best movie you're ever watch. I've even seen the story with the red cord done before (Case Closed: The Time Bombed Skyscraper).My issues with this film: Time travel elements just seem like a plot convenience. The body switching doesn't make sense, especially how she has a family history of this. The romance doesn't feel believable and isn't explained well.Things I like: I really like the art style, especially how a contrast between city versus rural. The music is quite fitting. The coming-of-age elements are done quite well.If you like Japanese anime you'll like this movie, but this isn't the best movie you'll ever watch.",6,1,1,9 May 2020
