Hereditary," Promises so much then falls flat on its face.
","If I was only going to review the first three quarters of the film I'd give it 8 or 9 stars. But the end portion is just so damn lazy and unoriginal it left me spelt disappointed. The writer either lost his nerve, or ran out of ideas. Such a shame, because the acting and directing are top notch.",6,1,2,27 December 2018
Bird Box," High concept, poor script
","The film probably had a really strong high concept logline, but the execution and script are poor. It flatters to deceive. The production values are good, so is the acting. But there's no reason or explanation or context, which would be fine if the action or tension were sky high, but they're not. It's simply a film about a journey, that's not scary enough to be a horror, not action packed enough for an action movie, and not thought through enough for a sci-fi.",5,1,3,27 December 2018
