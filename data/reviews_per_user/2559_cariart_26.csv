Miracle," Russell Shines in Story of '80 Olympic Hockey Triumph...
","MIRACLE, the Disney retelling of the U.S. Hockey squad's astonishing Gold Medal performance at Lake Placid in 1980, is not a great film (a TV-movie from 1981, 'Miracle on Ice', despite the bizarre casting of 69-year old Karl Malden as 43-year old coach Herb Brooks, is superior, although relying heavily on TV footage for game sequences), but it does offer Kurt Russell in one of the finest performances of his long career.The 53-year old Russell, a life-long veteran of both TV and film (making his debut on a 'Sugarfoot' TV episode, at age 6), has developed a reputation over the past two decades as a very competent, if not overpowering leading man, primarily in action films (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, TOMBSTONE, BREAKDOWN) and comedies (USED CARS, CAPTAIN RON, OVERBOARD). What is often forgotten, however, is that he has remarkable 'range' as an actor, with brilliant performances in the TV-movie 'Elvis' (1979), the underrated SWING SHIFT (1984, where he met his long-time love, Goldie Hawn), and 2003's DARK BLUE (as a crooked cop searching for redemption during the bloody aftermath of the Rodney King riots in L.A.). As age has carved his features, Russell has lost the 'beach boy' glamor that had often 'stereotyped' him in the past, and gives his 'Herb Brooks' a sense of credibility and pain that lifts his performance to Academy Award caliber.Herb Brooks was a remarkable person, long before Lake Placid. Despite success in coaching a string of national champion college hockey teams, he had never recovered from being the last player 'cut' from the 1960 Gold Medal U.S. hockey squad, and from being a member of the '64 and '68 teams that were humiliated by the Soviets. Driven by a desire to beat the nearly invincible Russian squad, he realized that a group of college 'all-stars' would never possess the 'team' skills to get the job done. Ruthlessly, refusing the assistance of the U.S. Olympic Hockey Committee, he pieced together a squad of talented skaters, 'broke' them, then remolded them to fit his vision, working them unmercifully for over six months, while spouting Vince Lombardi-like platitudes. Despite his torturous regimen, just days before the Olympics, his team would be humiliated by the Soviets, 10-3, and no one gave his squad a chance for a medal.But Brooks had faith, and a squad that was 'hungry'...While the film suffers from a lack of depth in the portrayal of the players (by the way, they do all their own skating; TV footage is not used), MIRACLE's 'feel' of the decade is well-done, using montages and voice-overs to convey the American sense of helplessness in a decade of tragedies. The unexpected U.S. victory galvanized the nation (Al Michaels' stunned reaction, 'Do you believe in Miracles?', has become a catch phrase for both the game, and the times), and actually contributed to turning the country around.While the Academy Awards will probably ignore Kurt Russell's commanding performance (as the film was not a 'hit'), MIRACLE is still a film worth viewing, given our own troubled times. While the film may not be 'great', it's message of hope is certainly worthwhile!",Null,26,34,13 May 2004
Lucky Number Slevin," Style Over Substance, But an Entertaining Ride!
","OK, so 'Lucky Number Slevin' falls easily into the Tarantino/'Pulp Fiction' mold, from it's graphic violence and plot twists, to the off-beat humor and quirky characterizations. And it won't take long to guess what the big 'secret' is that holds everything together (although it is intriguing to see who fits where in the scheme of things). Saying all this, however, I really enjoyed 'Slevin'! A lot of the entertainment of the film comes from first-rate actors obviously enjoying themselves. Trapped in a case of mistaken identity, Josh Hartnett, sporting a broken nose and lack of wardrobe in the early part of the film, takes every mishap and disaster with such aplomb that it's easy to see why mob bosses Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley look at him in stunned bewilderment (remember the gangster in the Marx Brothers' 'Monkey Business' hiring the totally whacked-out Groucho and Company as shipboard bodyguards? Hartnett has that same 'Are we on the same page?' attitude). Even more fun is the relationship between Hartnett and neighbor Lucy Lui (who has never been cuter or more energetic). When she walks into his 'borrowed' apartment, sees him naked, leaves, then pops back in, hoping to catch 'the next show', you KNOW there is chemistry! And when was the last time you saw verbal sexual foreplay consisting of obscure James Bond trivia? That scene has such a Kevin Smith 'feel' to it that I looked for his name as a screenwriter! Bruce Willis is also fun, as a very smug hit man (he seems nearly 'typed' as a hit man or cop, these days). Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, and 'Forrest Gump's' Mykelti Williamson also shine (it was nice seeing Aiello and Williamson, who I haven't seen much of, of late).Certainly, the ultimate 'pay-off' lacks the 'punch' of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Memento', or 'Go', but it does reveal a compassion that is surprising, considering the body count! Taken as a whole, Paul McGuigan's jaunt into 'Tarantino Land' is stylishly diverting!",7,2,4,30 November 2006
Casablanca," A Classic, Never Out-of-Date!
","So much has been written about CASABLANCA that you can get the uneasy feeling that any comment you make about the film has been made before, and better! It is the most cherished classic in film history, number two on the AFI list of the '100 Greatest Films of All Time' (only CITIZEN KANE, arguably the most influential film ever made, topped it); it's leading man, Humphrey Bogart, has been declared by the AFI as the 'Greatest Star of All Time', and 'Rick Blaine' was Bogie's greatest role; it has more phrases that have become part of our lexicon than any other film ('Round up the usual suspects', 'Here's looking at you, kid', 'We'll always have Paris', 'I stick my neck out for nobody', and the erroneous but immortal phrase, 'Play it again, Sam' are just a few); it has influenced pop culture for three generations, making fedoras and trench coats (and, unfortunately, cigarettes) essential elements of 'cool'. CASABLANCA is the definitive film about sacrificing for the 'greater good', with characters who are clearly flawed, yet find redemption and a higher purpose. Oh, and it is maybe the best romance ever made, to boot, without resorting to 'R' rated dialog or nude love scenes (a lesson sadly lost on film makers, today!)Despite paying a record sum for the unproduced play ('Everybody Comes to Rick's') that became CASABLANCA, the production itself was considered routine, just another of the 50 or so films the WB produced each year. Despite the presence of Ingrid Bergman (on loan from David O. Selznick) and Paul Henreid (from RKO), there was no finished script at the time of the shooting, and the cast would often not know what their lines would be until the cameras were about to roll. While this gave the film a kind of edginess that 'worked', it drove everyone crazy, particularly Bergman, who was anxious to finish and move on to the film she expected to be her 'classic', FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, with Gary Cooper. (CASABLANCA's ultimate place in film history, far greater than the Hemingway adaptation's, always stunned the actress!) Certainly, as filming 'wrapped', and Bogie returned to the sound stage for a last time, to record an added line, written by producer Hal Wallis to provide a warm, wry coda to the film ('Louis, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship'), all the participants moved on to their next jobs, unaware of what had been achieved.Some films are born great; some are 'touched by the Gods', with the elements that created them combining with the timing of the release to make them 'classic'. CASABLANCA was such a film. When the finished production was assembled, the Epstein brothers' brilliant dialog (written, often, at the last moment) blended perfectly with Howard Koch's dramatic and Casey Robinson's romantic script elements. Under the sure hand of director Michael Curtiz, with a wildly romantic Max Steiner score, and Dooley Wilson singing 'As Time Goes By', the WB knew it had a hit...then, as the film was released, the invasion of North Africa began, and suddenly the word 'Casablanca' was on EVERYONE'S lips! CASABLANCA went from being just a 'hit', to being THE film of 1942. That it won the Oscar for 'Best Picture' surprised no one; what surprised everyone was the fact that film gained in luster and popularity with each passing year, winning whole new generations of fans with it's timeless tale, and charismatic leading man. As John Huston told an interviewer, in the 60s, 'Bogie is more popular today than he ever was', and the same can be said of CASABLANCA, today.To borrow a quote from HIGHLANDER, 'In the end, there can be only one'...to film lovers, around the world, CASABLANCA is the one!",Null,0,0,25 August 2003
Friday Night Lights," Berg's Wise, Human Tale of Football and Small Towns...
","Ever since Peter Bogdanovich, in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, provided a comic view of a small town's total involvement in the fortunes of a high school football team (remember the verbal abuse the locals heaped on Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms when they lost the 'big game'?), Hollywood has attempted, with varying degrees of success, to make the 'definitive' small town/football film.Director Peter Berg has finally done it, with Friday NIGHT LIGHTS!Based on H. G. Bissinger's best-selling tale of the 1988 season of the Odessa (Texas) High School 'Permian Panthers', the film unflinchingly paints a vivid canvas of a school and community obsessed with winning, as football provides the only release from poverty and desperation. While the concept is reminiscent of Tom Cruise's earlier ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, Berg doesn't glamorize the hero or tie things up, neatly, at the climax; in real life, while victories are savored, they are, at best, a temporary 'high'...while defeats can drive rational people into irrational frenzies. The Panthers' fortunes are such a crutch to Odessa's emotional well-being, that each game becomes a narcotic 'fix' for the entire community...a situation potentially dangerous for the players, and their coaches.While Billy Bob Thornton has received the bulk of media attention, as the stern but fair head coach (with glowing reviews for BAD SANTA, and THE ALAMO, Thornton is having a career-defining year!), the film is really an ensemble work, with stand-out performances by Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Garrett Hedlund, and, surprisingly, singer Tim McGraw (as Hedlund's 'reliving past glories' father). The entire cast is exceptional, avoiding the easy pitfalls of simply playing stereotypes.At times brutal and gritty, at times nearly surrealistic, Friday NIGHT LIGHTS refuses to fall into the clichés that marred REMEMBER THE TITANS, VARSITY BLUES and THE PROGRAM, eschewing the artsy but smug self-righteousness of Oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN Sunday, as well.This may well be the finest football film ever made...as well as one of the most honest portrayals of life in a small town.I will be surprised if it doesn't make most critics' 'Ten Best' lists, at year's end, and is a major Oscar contender.Peter Berg has gotten the formula right!",Null,2,5,8 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun Pirate Saga!
","Now, I'll admit I loved PIRATES, but it is not without faults, the greatest being, IT'S TOO LONG! Will SOMEBODY tell Jerry Bruckheimer that a feature film doesn't HAVE to be over two hours and fifteen minutes long? A half hour trimmed would have tightened the plot, kept the audience jumping at the climaxes (and not for the bathroom), and increased the revenue, as another showtime could be squeezed in each day.
That being said, there is a lot to like about the film. A truly good pirate movie MUST obey certain guidelines: a swashbuckling hero, an equally strong damsel, a truly dastardly villain, a great climactic duel, a romance, at least one major sea battle and city plundering scene, LOTS of pirate lore, and respect for the time frame of the film (NO lapses into 20th or 21st century jargon or technology, for the sake of plot or humor). Hollywood's last major pirate effort, CUTTHROAT ISLAND, had Gena Davis as a distaff hero, which was acceptable (Maureen O'Hara had played a swashbuckler in several 40s-50s films), and Frank Langella as the villain, which was inspired casting...but Matthew Modine was so wimpish a leading man that the romance between him and Davis looked ridiculous, and Davis evolved into a near caricature, to fill the void...and the film descended into present-day campiness, which was the kiss of death.
Director Gore Verbinski, and writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert clearly did their homework for PIRATES, and admirably filled each pirate movie requirement. Two heroes swash their way through the film; Johnny Depp is the picturebook pirate, complete with outrageous attire, a braided beard, eye makeup, a drunken swagger, and the best damn' Keith Richards impersonation I've ever seen; Orlando Bloom is the heroic, Errol Flynn-like buccaneer, out to rescue his damsel, and full of lofty ideals. Eighteen-year-old Keira Knightley is the heroine, and while her acting skills are average, at best, she shows a lot of spunk (and cleavage), and positively glows, onscreen. The villain is another inspired piece of casting; Geoffrey Rush, while not as menacing as Frank Langella, has a ball as the snarling yet world-weary Pirate leader. As for the pirate crews (there are two), they are perfect; you have guys with hooks and peg legs, barbarians straight out of MOBY DICK, even a parrot and a monkey as sidekicks, all hankering for rum, riches, and victims to 'walk the plank'. That one crew is all cursed, and reveal themselves to be skeletal, decomposing corpses under the full moon only increases their nasty perfection!
The film borrows heavily from THE CRIMSON PIRATE, TREASURE ISLAND, SWASHBUCKLER, Universal Pictures' 40s B-movie pirate flicks, and even a few Hammer horror features of the early 60s, but it all fits together fairly seamlessly. Still, the excessive length would be a fatal flaw, were it not for Johnny Depp's physical and verbal presense. He is the glue that holds everything together, and he is VERY much up to the task! Whenever the film starts to drag, Depp has some bit of 'business' that is hilarious, and keeps things rolling.
I won't delve into the plot (cursed gold, kidnappings, a gallows scene...pretty standard pirate stuff), but I will say that you could do a LOT worse than PIRATES in this season of overblown sequels and underwhelming originals.
Go to the bathroom before you go to the theater, and ENJOY!",Null,0,0,3 August 2003
Stripes," Bill Murray Shines In Brilliant, If Uneven Comedy...
","STRIPES, the best service comedy of the 80's, was released during Bill Murray's halcyon career years (1979-1984), and has moments of absolute lunacy and imagination, faltering only during the last third of the film. A showcase for many rising stars (Harold Ramis, John Candy, John Larroquette, Sean Young, Judge Reinhold) and featuring Warren Oates' funniest performance on film, it nevertheless is primarily Murray's show, and he delivers, brilliantly!
As an arrogant but likable loser who thrives on twisting the 'rules' to suit him, Murray combines physical humor, sly one-liners, and an anti-establishment point of view to establish himself as the logical successor to the anarchists of ANIMAL HOUSE. His character, John Winger, is not only a jerk, but charismatic enough to make being a smartass desirable! After losing his girl, his job, his home, and even his pizza ('Then depression set in,' he announces), he sees a TV commercial for the Army, and convinces his friend Russell Ziskey (sweetly played by Harold Ramis), an English language teacher who's better at teaching cuss words to his students than English, to drop everything and enlist with him.
Basic is a challenge for Winger, as the Army expects him to be a soldier! In a unit comprised of idiots, psychopaths, potheads, and an overweight recruit who enlisted to 'shed a few pounds' in a 'Club Med'-style environment (John Candy, who is very funny), Winger immediately attempts to take charge, only to be put down by gruff drill instructor, Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), who is wise to all of Winger's scams. Not that this interferes with Winger and Ziskey's social life; the pair soon have MP girlfriends (P.J. Soles and Sean Young) sharing trysts in the General's quarters!The film's highlight occurs after Sgt. Hulka is incapacitated by an exploding grenade. Faced with having to start basic training all over again, Winger coaches the unit overnight in HIS kind of drill for the final Review and Parade. Unfortunately, everyone then oversleeps, and arrive at the Parade Ground in all manner of dress. Winger's unorthodox marching routines are a hit, however, and the General, thinking he is watching a crack outfit, addresses Winger in one of the funniest exchanges ever recorded on film!Unfortunately, STRIPES doesn't end with Winger's completion of basic training, but moves to Europe, where the unit (and Sgt. Hulka) are assigned to guard an attack vehicle that looks suspiciously like an RV. While there are a few amusing moments in this final chapter of the film, it lacks the inspired madness of basic training, and drags, a bit, until the famous 'Magazine Cover' postscript.
All in all, STRIPES is a memorable, if flawed near-classic, and paved the way for Murray and Ramis' blockbuster, GHOSTBUSTERS. If you're a Bill Murray or service comedy fan, it should not be missed!",Null,0,1,19 August 2003
The Girl Next Door," Engaging Homage to 80's Teen Flicks...
","THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Luke Greenfield's sexy yet sweet teen angst flick, owes a lot to both the RISKY BUSINESS premise (HS Senior, his goal a prestigious college, has his life turned 'upside-down' by world-wise 'Pro'), and the internal structure of John Hughes' 80's teen 'classics' (geeky hero, and his two geekier friends, gain acceptance and prestige through his relationship with a 'dream girl').Close your eyes, and you could easily picture the young Anthony Michael Hall or John Cusack filling Emile Hirsch's role, with Rebecca De Mornay or Kelly Preston replacing Elisha Cuthbert as his ex-porn star girlfriend. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, however, actually works quite well, thanks to Greenfield's 'tongue-in-cheek' approach to the naughtiness, and a flawless supporting cast, particularly Timothy Olyphant as a likable but ultimately ruthless porn producer, and Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock, as Hirsch's clueless but blindly supportive parents. Emile Hirsch shows a propensity towards 'soulfully earnest' expressions, but does provide one of the film's funniest scenes, as, while high on Ecstasy, he attempts to navigate through a crowd awaiting his speech on 'high moral fiber'. While some critics tended to brush off Elisha Cuthbert's performance as just another skin-baring 'boy toy' variation, she actually conveys the vulnerability and pain of her character's past quite effectively, balancing it with sly humor and a LOT of 'sex appeal', done within the restraints of her 'No Nudity' contract clause...Sorry, guys, while you'll see a LOT of her skin, you AREN'T going to see Elisha 'bare all'...The film is a very funny, breezy lark, and while it never achieves the heights of insanity of RISKY BUSINESS, it certainly stands as one of the better 'teen' comedies of the past few years!",Null,75,100,6 October 2004
The Fifth Element," Wild, Giddy Space Opera...
","The story goes that director Luc Besson began writing THE FIFTH ELEMENT in his teens, incorporating all the Sci-Fi elements he loved into one over-the-top, grand space opera...sort of an 'E.E. 'Doc' Smith 'Skylark' Meets Flash Gordon and Barbarella' hybrid with sex, intergalactic action, and even some pseudo-religious overtones tossed in...in other words, a teenage daydream come true! Critics panned the end result for this very reason, sneering at Bruce Willis' Earth-saving (yet again!) Korben Dallas, and Besson's then-girlfriend, clothing-optional Milla Jovovich, as the innocent demigod, Leeloo.The critics were wrong!THE FIFTH ELEMENT is, in the best sense of the word, a classic 'B' movie, a space opera where a prologue vaguely similar to STARGATE leads to a future Earth where traffic jams occur thirty stories above the ground, humanity is ruled by beefy 'Tiny' Lister Jr., and where the Ultimate Evil is served by everyone's favorite villain, Gary Oldman, sporting a Southern accent! If this DOESN'T convince you that this is a 'popcorn' flick, not to be taken too seriously, there is Chris Tucker, sporting a blond hairdo, as the Galaxy's favorite media personality, promoting himself as he hits on his adoring female fans; Ian Holm, as the monk who knows 'the Secret', forced, despite himself, to become an active participant in the adventure; and some of the most butt-ugly alien mercenaries you'll ever see, terrorizing a space resort, until they meet their match in Bruce Willis' 'DIE HARD in Space' protagonist! Yippee-Ki-Yay, indeed!The FX are astonishing, the comedy, broad and sly, the heroics, macho, and as Leeloo, sent to save Earth, Jovovich manages to be both naive and sexy, with broken English and a gymnast's grace.Bruce Willis is a joy, as always, to watch, and he carries the film with charm and self-depreciating humor, whether dealing with endless phone calls from his mother, driving his sky taxi recklessly (cabbies change very little in the future!), taking on terrorists single-handed, or falling for the exotic Leeloo. When he blows away a roomful of hostage-holding aliens, then asks, 'Does anyone else want to negotiate?', you KNOW Besson picked the right guy for the lead!If you want Profound Science Fiction, watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY again...but if you want to kick back and just have fun, look not further...THE FIFTH ELEMENT delivers!",Null,1,2,16 November 2003
Insomnia," 'Crime and Punishment', Nolan-style!
","Christopher Nolan (who is only 32, believe it or not), understands and utilizes visual elements more effectively than nearly any other of the current crop of directors (Darren Aronofsky, who helmed 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' is the only other current director in his league). 'Memento' worked, in large part, because we were forced, through flashbacks and flashforwards, to 'see' and deduce through Guy Pearce's eyes, putting the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of his past together just as he is. 'Following', Nolan's first film, utilizes a similar format, to a lesser degree, as a casual voyeur is manipulated into becoming a 'fall guy' for a murder.Working for the first time from a script he didn't write, Nolan had to rethink how to incorporate those elements uniquely his into another author's plot, and he did it, masterfully.Al Pacino is called to Alaska with his partner ostensively to assist in a homicide investigation of a young girl, but also to get away from an L.A. Internal Affairs probe that is about to reveal his doctoring of evidence to put away a serial killer. Despite his status as a legendary career cop, his partner tells him, early on, that he plans to plea bargain when they return, and bring Pacino down. Facing disgrace, jail, and the possibility of all his criminal convictions being overturned, while dealing with the hero worship a young local cop (Hilary Swank) has for his honesty and integrity, you can see he is facing a major moral dilemma.He quickly deduces enough to create a trap for the killer, but the stakeout is botched, and the killer runs, shooting a cop and fleeing into the fog. In pursuit, Pacino shoots at a form in the mist, only to discover he has mortally wounded his partner. With his dying breath, the partner accuses him of shooting him to hush him up, and that image and those words would haunt Pacino, as he attempts to hide his act, and endure guilt-ridden flashbacks dominating sleepless nights in a summer of eternal daylight in the far north. Compounding the mental deterioration Pacino experiences is the fact that the girl's killer (brilliantly portrayed by Robin Williams) saw the shooting, and uses this as leverage against the career cop, calling him whenever Pacino attempts to sleep. 'We're the same,' he says, soothingly, to Pacino. 'I didn't want to kill the girl, you didn't want to kill your partner. We can help each other, and no one need ever find out.'Nolan gets the best performance out of Pacino that I've seen since 'Heat', as the detective slowly cracks under the strain of guilt and sleeplessness, trying to find a way to capture Williams without revealing his own guilt. Williams is his match, calmly matching wits with the deteriorating cop, and setting up 'wild cards' to  implicate Pacino's coverup.An element I especially enjoyed was that the wild beauty of Alaska's frontier becomes more and more overpowering and Pacino seems to implode, as the film reaches it's inevitable conclusion. He becomes gaunt, washed out, a shell of the confident pro he had been in the film's opening scenes, while Williams becomes more assured and smugly self-confident. But in this film, unlike 'Memento' and 'Following', there is redemption; in his refusal to allow Swank to do a coverup, but to maintain her 'innocence' as an honest cop, he, metaphorically, 'purges' himself, and he is finally able to 'sleep'.Is 'Insomnia' as good as 'Memento'? No; that film is in a class by itself. But 'Insomnia' is a remarkably well-crafted and thought-provoking film, and certainly does Nolan credit!",Null,0,0,12 October 2002
Gettysburg," Long, but Powerful Epic, Filmed on Location...
","GETTYSBURG, based on Michael Shaara's bestseller, 'The Killer Angels', is a truly remarkable film, in it's clear, if long, presentation of the Civil War's bloodiest, best-known, yet least understood battle, in it's 'humanizing' of the almost legendary characters of the period, and, most amazingly, for being filmed at the actual locations where the actions took place, in Gettysburg, itself. From Little Round Top to Seminary Ridge, you see the events where they actually occurred, 140 years ago. It is a singular achievement, and Ted Turner deserves credit for making it happen.Two characters dominate the film; Jeff Daniels, in one of his finest performances, is a likable, totally believable Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Maine ex-schoolteacher who would win the Congressional Medal of Honor; and Tom Berenger, sporting a huge, bushy beard, is a sympathetic 'voice of reason' as Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, successor to 'Stonewall' Jackson as Robert E. Lee's field commander. Chamberlain and Longstreet provide the film it's focus, as honorable men attempting to fulfill their duty, while the carnage builds around each of them. Other memorable performances include Sam Elliott, in a brief but memorable cameo as Brig. Gen. John Buford, the battle-hardened cavalry commander who initiates the battle after guessing the Confederates' objectives at Gettysburg; Richard Jordan, in one of his last appearances before his untimely death, as Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead, facing his best friend in battle; Kevin Conway, as Chamberlain's gruff but likable Irish First Sergeant, Sgt. 'Buster' Kilrain; C. Thomas Howell as Lt. Thomas D. Chamberlain, Joshua's brother, who creates a sense of familial concern for Daniels; and Stephen Lang (who would go on to play Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson in GODS AND GENERALS), as an ever-confident, ebullient Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett.In the pivotal role of Robert E. Lee, Martin Sheen is less effective, lacking Lee's well-documented charisma, and substituting constant world-weary gazes for characterization. Robert Duvall, who assumed the role in GODS AND GENERALS, would be far more credible as Lee.The sheer numbers of the battle are staggering; over 150,000 combatants, with 53,000 dead, more in a single three-day engagement than were lost during the entire war in Vietnam. The armies of actors, extras, and recreators could not nearly match those numbers, yet the film effectively conveys the immensity of the conflict. The tactical errors (Lee's decision, on the third day of battle, to order Pickett's suicidal charge into the Union guns; Meade's decision, drawing the fury of President Lincoln, to allow the Southern survivors to return home without further slaughter, while a humane gesture, probably lengthening the war) are presented within the context of of the overall conflict, providing the viewer with justification for their decisions.Director Ronald F. Maxwell presents a complex, fascinating tapestry in GETTYSBURG, and it is not a film you will soon forget!",Null,60,69,14 March 2004
Lost in Translation," Bill Murray's Finest Performance in Coppola Gem...
","In a career that can easily be defined as a cinematic rollercoaster ride, Bill Murray has gone from the heights of comic madness (CADDYSHACK, STRIPES, GHOSTBUSTERS), to a major plunge, after his earnest but ill-fated first attempt at drama (THE RAZOR'S EDGE), to a rebuilding mode, as a less manic, more sympathetic comic actor (WHAT ABOUT BOB?, GROUNDHOG DAY), to a dramatic actor of considerable skill (MAD DOG AND GLORY, RUSHMORE, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS), with an occasional 'blast from the past' creeping in (SCROOGED, KINGPIN, SPACE JAM). Less pretentious than Robin Williams, and not 'cuddly' like Steve Martin, Murray has become more interesting over the years, his face a road map of a fully-lived life, his signature sarcasm mellowing into a gentle bemusement at a world he doesn't truly 'fit' in. All he lacked was a vehicle to truly capture his essence, and brilliant young writer/director Sofia Coppola has supplied it, in the wonderful LOST IN TRANSLATION.As 'Bob Harris', a '70s action star whose career has been reduced to accepting 'product endorsement' gigs, he finds himself in Tokyo, promoting whiskey in a culture totally alien to him. Jet-lagged and dazed, he stumbles through a commercial shoot with a manic Japanese director, and the 'gift' of a call girl ('Lip my stockings!' she screams, substituting an 'L' for an 'R'), and winds up frequenting the hotel bar, substituting booze for sleep.Similarly 'out of sync' is Charlotte (wonderfully played by rising young star Scarlett Johansson), wife of an American photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) doing a series of assignments in Japan. With little to do while he is on location, she 'drifts', unable to fully embrace the culture, or to find a purpose in her own life. The bar becomes a late night sanctuary for her, as well.Naturally, the two displaced Americans meet, and one of the most natural, warm friendships to be seen on film in recent memory emerges. To Coppola's credit, she allows it to be romantic without becoming overtly sexual, grounding it in the reality of two married people able to 'love' one another without the guilt of an indiscretion (when Harris foolishly 'cheats', it is with a cabaret singer in a one-night stand, which he is embarrassed by, and Charlotte takes him 'to task' for). Because the affection between the pair is based on friendship, foremost, the 34-year age difference between them is never an issue; they are truly kindred spirits in a world not of their choosing.Coppola (whose earlier directorial effort, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, displayed a masterful understanding of teen sexuality), here shows a sensitivity of midlife crisis that is remarkable. 'The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you,' Harris explains, as Charlotte expresses her concerns about her own future. An impressive observation, from the pen of a 32-year old writer/director! From the casual evenings in the bar, to the wild and amusing 'dates' in Tokyo, to the poignant conclusion of the film, Coppola, Murray, and Johansson hit all the right 'buttons', never falling into the melodramatic clichés that often ruin romantic films. Sofia Coppola won a well-deserved Oscar for her screenplay (in a year without Hobbits, she may have gotten a 'Best Director' Oscar, as well). Scarlett Johansson's performance deserved more recognition; she will be a force to reckon with, in the future.And for Bill Murray, the film put him at the pinnacle; an Oscar nomination for Best Actor (which, although he lost to Sean Penn, prompted host Billy Crystal to proclaim, after the announcement, 'Bill, we all LOVE you!', sparking the audience of his peers to an ovation). LOST IN TRANSLATION is a testament to the wonderful actor Bill Murray has become!",Null,0,1,23 March 2004
Armageddon," Rednecks in Space...Or, Good Old Boys Vs. The Apocalypse!
","If you're looking for a sensitive, thoughtful look at humanity facing extinction, watch ON THE BEACH. If, however, you want to crack a beer, scratch your belly, and hoot and holler, then ARMAGEDDON is for you!Bruce Willis, more subdued than usual, plays the world's greatest driller, who's recruited to lead his team of intellectually-challenged misfits into space to plant charges and blow up an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. His crew of stereotypes include a brash young stud (Ben Affleck, proving he quit drama class at least a couple of semesters too soon) in love with his daughter (Liv Tyler, who must have skipped her drama classes entirely); a slightly air-headed hippie (Owen Wilson, playing...Owen Wilson); a rigger with 'a past' (Will Patton); a gentle giant (Michael Clarke Duncan, in his first major role); and a wise-cracking psychopath (Steve Buscemi, who looks like he went outside the spacecraft without his spacesuit).Heading the NASA support team in Houston is Billy Bob Thornton, who gives the best overall performance in the film, and had so much fun working with Willis that the pair would team up again, in BANDITS.Don't THINK while watching this, or you'll get yourself in trouble (I loved how NASA just happened to have some size 50XXXL spacesuits around for a couple of the beefier drillers); just run with it, and enjoy the movie for the cheesy spectacle it is! Unlike the year's other big 'Asteroid on a Collision Course with Earth' movie, DEEP IMPACT, it doesn't bog itself down in weepy melodramatic subplots...This is the Wild West in Space, with big men, lots of cool toys, and enough rootin'-tootin' explosive action to fill a dozen Saturday matinees.Pass me a beer, and let's enjoy the show!",Null,0,1,6 September 2003
North by Northwest," Grant on the Run in Hitchcock Classic!
","'North by Northwest' is the ONE Hitchcock movie no film lover's collection should be without. Suspenseful, funny, sexy, exciting, it works perfectly on so many levels that the film just gets better and better with repeated viewings.The story is really quite simple; a successful New York ad executive (Cary Grant, in superb form) is mistaken for an American espionage agent by a group of Soviet spies (led by the ruthlessly suave James Mason, and his aide, a youthful yet sinister Martin Landau), and a cat-and-mouse cross-country chase begins, culminating on top of Mount Rushmore. Along the way, Grant is ridiculed by his mother (Jesse Royce Landis, who is hilarious, if actually YOUNGER than Grant), seduced by double-agent Eva Marie Saint (in the sexiest role of her career), chased across a cornfield by a lethal crop duster (in one of the greatest scenes in film history), and recruited into the intelligence community (represented by future 'Man from U.N.C.L.E.' boss, Leo G. Carroll), while Bernard Herrmann's unforgettable music punctuates each scene. Yes, the film has it's faults and a few technical gaffes, but for sheer excitement and fun, you can't top 'North By Northwest'. Hitchcock and Grant both considered this to be one of their favorite films, and it has become a classic!",10,0,0,21 August 2003
The Alamo," Flawed but Entertaining Epic...
","John Lee Hancock's THE ALAMO is often sluggish, mired in his effort to provide 'detail' in an attempt at honesty, and it is nearly 90 minutes before action fans get their money's worth (and they do; the Alamo's siege and 'last stand' are mesmerizing), but all that being said, the film is a remarkable re-evaluation of one of America's best-known legends.While each of the story's principals (David Crockett, James Bowie, William Barret Travis, Sam Houston, and Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana) are de-mythologized, it is Crockett (brilliantly conceived by Billy Bob Thornton) who captures and holds your attention. Neither the folksy backwoodsman (as portrayed previously by Fess Parker and Arthur Hunnicutt), nor the hero answering an oppressed people's call for help (John Wayne's 'take' on Crockett), Thornton's Crockett is a well-dressed country 'sophisticate', who plays the violin and the political game in Washington very well. As the film opens, he attends a Washington production of 'The Lion of the West', based on his fictional exploits, with a leading man dressed in what we today consider the 'Official Crockett Uniform' of buckskins and a coonskin cap. The character on stage, and the legends surrounding him which would ultimately incorporate the Alamo as it's final act, is the 'DAVY Crockett' we all know, but the 'real' David Crockett, according to Hancock, is an opportunist who sees political rebirth in Texas, and arrives hoping the battle is already over. Thornton is masterful, showing Crockett's ambition, his fear of having to 'live up' to the legends surrounding him, and his gradual emergence into a true hero, who would defy Santa Ana with his last breath.The other leads aren't given as much screen time for character development, with the exception of Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston, a heavy-drinking pragmatist with a political agenda and ambitions of his own. Patrick Wilson's Travis is a failure as a father and husband, hoping to rebuild his life and reputation in Texas; Jason Patric's Bowie is a glowering, unsavory adventurer/businessman, involved in slave trafficking, and terminally ill during the siege (Hooker does, however, bow to legend, allowing the dying Bowie a chance to fire his pistols at the Mexicans before being overwhelmed). Emilio Echevarría, the first Mexican to ever play Santa Ana in an American film, has gotten bad press for his portrayal of the leader as a loud-mouthed, insensitive, lecherous egotist, but from all accounts, that WAS what the real Santa Ana was like.While the slow pacing of most of the film is a problem, the film's final half hour appears rushed, as the Alamo's fall jumps quickly into Sam Houston's victory over Santa Ana, at San Jacinto (an event that occurred after a momentous six weeks of defeat and tragedy barely touched upon by Hancock). While it is understandable that the film makers wanted an 'upbeat' ending, it comes across as jarring, nonetheless.If you like your heroes and history 'bigger than life', the 2004 ALAMO will disappoint, and you should stick to John Wayne's version. If, however, you want a new perspective, and are willing to dispense with the preconceptions of the past, this film has a LOT to offer!",7,85,107,11 April 2004
The Dirty Dozen," War Classic Stands Test of Time...
","'The Dirty Dozen', Robert Aldrich's 1967 adventure classic, would redefine a whole genre of films, as public attitudes towards warfare and heroism changed, due to Vietnam. With 'heroes' who were certainly not noble, a mission that would require a level of cruelty film audiences had never before seen from American fighting men, and graphic language and bloodshed, the impact of the the film was both immediate (despite huge 'box office', many critics panned the film as 'disturbing' and glorifying violence), and continuing (influencing films as diverse as 'Patton' and 'Saving Private Ryan'). It can be viewed at many levels, as a crackling good adventure yarn, an 'anti-establishment' and anti-war statement, the ultimate 'buddy' film...few films have generated as much controversy, or stood the passage of time, better! Based on E.M. Nathanson's novel (of rumored 'Death Row' convicts offered a pardon or reduction of sentence for volunteering for a suicide mission), with a large dash of the Pathfinders' legendary 'Filthy Thirteen' of WWII tossed in, the property was purchased as a potential starring vehicle for John Wayne. The Duke passed on the project, however (choosing to make 'The Green Berets', instead). Director Aldrich never envisioned Wayne in the lead, preferring WWII Marine vet Lee Marvin in the complex role of maverick Maj. John Reisman, and the actor, fresh from winning an Oscar for 'Cat Ballou', was dead-on perfect in the part. Veteran stars Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker, Robert Webber, George Kennedy, and Richard Jaeckel were cast as Marvin's military allies and adversaries.For the 'Front Six' of the Dozen, sullen Charles Bronson (another WWII vet), John Cassavetes (who would garner an Oscar nomination), Telly Savalas (in the most 'whacked-out' role in his career), Clint Walker (of 'Cheyenne' TV fame), football legend Jim Brown (in only his second film), and popular singer Trini Lopez (in his film debut) would dominate the screen time, with a 'Back Six' of character actors in much smaller roles, simply filling out the rest of the twelve parts. But a movie 'miracle' occurred; when Walker objected to a scene where, as a bogus 'General', he would idiotically review an Airborne unit (feeling it demeaned Native Americans, who his character portrayed), Aldrich passed the scene to 'Back Six' actor Donald Sutherland...and the scene would spectacularly launch his career, leading to his starring role in 'M.A.S.H.' Aldrich's meticulous shooting style, and the often rainy British weather (where the film was shot), more than doubled the shooting schedule, and after seven months on location, Trini Lopez (on the advice of friend Frank Sinatra), informed Aldrich and the producers that he was missing singing dates, and would need a pay hike to continue. To Lopez' surprise, Aldrich 'dropped' him, having him die in the climactic parachute drop! The director was warned that if he didn't eliminate the film's most controversial scene (pouring gasoline and dropping grenades on the women guests, as well as the Nazi officers seeking refuge in the bomb shelters), he would lose any chance of a 'Best Director' Oscar nomination. After soul-searching, he left the scene in ('War is Hell, and HAS to be portrayed that way'), and while he sacrificed the prize, Robert Aldrich gave the film a brutal honesty that subsequent wars would sadly verify.'The Dirty Dozen' survived contemporary criticism, and has proved to be one of the most enduring war films of all time, as fresh today as when it debuted in 1967.",10,2,6,29 July 2006
Seabiscuit," Extraordinary Film About Extraordinary Horse!
","This is a slowly-paced, but grand tale of the 'washed-up' horse that became a source of inspiration to America during the Depression. It is, more importantly, the story of three men, who, through their involvement with the horse, find meaning in tragedy-filled lives. The jockey, Red Pollard, sensitively played by Tobey Maguire, was 'sold' to a horse owner as a teen, as his family lost everything and was reduced to a migratory life. Hot-tempered, Pollard turns to prizefighting (getting beaten so badly that he loses sight in his right eye), and riding, to make ends meet. The trainer, Tom Smith (played by the always wonderful Oscar-winner Chris Cooper), loses his job in a Wild West show with the Depression, and is considered a crazy old man; he is a horse whisperer, one of the unique breed of people who CAN actually talk to horses, and heal them. The owner, Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges, who should FINALLY get his Oscar with this role), starts off as a Preston Tucker-like entrepreneur with an expanding car dealership, a loving wife, and an adoring son...then his son dies, and his wife has a breakdown and divorces him, leaving him dazed and crushed, emotionally. Finding happiness with a beautiful, understanding new wife (Elizabeth Banks), who suggests buying a horse, Howard first hires Smith (finding in him a kindred spirit), and Smith chooses the undersized, physically abused, temperamental Seabiscuit as the horse to buy (for nearly nothing; nobody gave the broken-down horse a chance). In a beautiful scene, Smith sees Seabiscuit fighting it's handlers, as Pollard fights a mob of angry stableboys, and realizes the two were 'meant' to be together. Howard 'adopts' young Pollard as his jockey, and the legend begins... The film has two climaxes, which dilutes their impact, somewhat, but is absolutely necessary, as each actually happened. First is the running battle to get a match race between the 'little horse that could' and the 'Horse of the Ages', the gigantic stallion and Triple Crown winner, War Admiral. The Admiral's owner, Samuel Riddle, played by veteran actor Eddie Jones, does not want his never-beaten champion to race the tiny horse he considers a sideshow freak, and to have the press turn the contest into a 'David and Goliath'-style headline. Public pressure finally gets him to concede, but he demands that the race be held at the Admiral's home track of Pimlico, three thousand miles away from Seabiscuit. Howard agrees, but then tragedy strikes; Red Pollard, in a freak track accident, has his leg crushed, and is told he will never race again. Another jockey rides Seabiscuit, in what would go down as the greatest match race in history (need I say who won?) In the next regular race, Seabiscuit's ligaments in one leg exploded, and he collapsed on the track. Despite pressure from the track vet, Smith refused to have the horse put down, and the horse joins Pollard in being 'put out to pasture'. But neither horse nor rider are ready to quit yet, and a miracle is about to happen, which is the basis for the second climax! The cast is uniformly excellent (watch for William H. Macy's very funny turn as a radio race announcer), and the final race for Seabiscuit actually had me in tears, and the theater audience applauding, things that seldom happen during movies these days! That the story is true makes it even more meaningful, and should serve as a lesson to anyone who thinks that disabilities means giving up hope. As both horse and jockey prove, the heart of champions can never be vanquished. SEABISCUIT is a champion!",Null,0,0,3 August 2003
The Man Who Would Be King," Grand Adventure, Huston-style!
","No director ever personalized a genre the way John Huston could. While some critics have claimed his style was a 'lack' of style, the opposite is actually true; his sense of irony, love of the absurd, respect for personal codes of honor, and twist endings that always remind us that the true value of a journey is not arriving at a destination, but in the 'getting there' all set apart his best work from that of his contemporaries. Even his lesser work has value, and his best films, which certainly includes THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING, are unforgettable.The tragicomic tale of two ex-Sergeants turned confidence men with a grand scheme to fleece a near-legendary kingdom had been a 'pet' project of Huston's since the forties, and he'd spent years tinkering with the script, planning to film it with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the leads. With Bogart's death in 1957, he'd considered various other match-ups (including Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole), until he found the ideal pair, in Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Connery had just finished the spectacular THE WIND AND THE LION (in which Huston played a small, but memorable role), and the Scot had often been compared to Gable with his dark good looks, machismo, and lack of pretense. Michael Caine, a long-time friend of Connery, was one of the industry's busiest actors, and had already proved himself adept at playing both soldiers and con men. Together, Connery and Caine had a camaraderie and chemistry that even Gable and Bogart couldn't have equaled, and Huston was 'quite pleased'.Christopher Plummer was another inspired piece of casting, as the legendary author Rudyard Kipling. Bookish, with a keen intellect and rich sense of humor, Plummer's Kipling, sharing Masonic ties with the future 'Kings', is the perfect foil for the duo, offering sound advice which they totally disregard, with a wink and a smile. As Dravot (Connery) tells him, 'We are not little men', and India, bound up in British bureaucracy (as well as becoming too 'hot' for them) could never provide the immensity of riches they dreamed of.Huston eschewed the 'traditional' approach to adventure films, with cardboard heroes performing near-impossible deeds until the inevitable 'happy ending', and grounded his story in reality, which disappointed any viewers hoping KING would simply be a variation of GUNGA DIN. But in not romanticizing the story, he gives it a sense of immensity and the exotic, a richness of character, and an understanding of human frailties that far surpasses a typical Hollywood product. While Dravot orchestrates the pair's ultimate ruin by taking his 'godhood' too seriously (as he turns 'noble', trying to bring order to his 'kingdom', and decides to start a dynasty by taking a wife), you can understand why Carnehan (Caine), seeing their 'get rich' scheme disintegrate, would be anxious to leave, but also why he would forgive his friend, when they face torture and certain death. Loyalty, to Huston, is not lip service, but a true measure of a man. While Dravot and Carnehan are certainly not role models, their love and respect for each other transcends their faults, even their lives, putting the film's final scene, as a physically crushed Carnehan leaves his 'bundle' for Kipling, into perspective. It is a moment you won't soon forget.
THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING proves, yet again, why John Huston, as he once described his friend, Humphrey Bogart, is 'irreplaceable'.",Null,68,85,30 November 2003
The Longest Day," An Unforgettable Overview of an Epic Battle!
","'The Longest Day' is perhaps the greatest dramatic record of one of the defining moments in world history. After the intimacy of 'Saving Private Ryan', many critics have accused it of being a 'sanitized' version of the Normandy Invasion, but it is a different kind of film, entirely! While Steven Speilberg's aim was to personalize the horror facing the first wave of troops to hit the beach, Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, a D-Day vet, himself, wanted to create a mosaic of the myriad of personalities, events, and experiences that shaped the day. It is a film that looks objectively at all the forces who fought this epic battle, wisely casting major stars of each country to portray actual and fictitious characters. This was a bold move at the time, as subtitles are used extensively, giving the film has a uniquely international flavor. This is not your usual war film with 'American actors doing funny accents'!
There are many standout performances; a few that deserve particular recognition are Richard Burton's war-weary RAF pilot, the last survivor of his original squadron; Dietmar Schönherr as one of the few remaining Luftwaffe pilots, faced with the impossible order of stopping the invasion with two airplanes; Jeffrey Hunter, a young sergeant who is 'Dear John'ed and faces the horrendous Omaha landing; a pre-James Bond Sean Connery as a cocky Irish infantryman; Red Buttons, as a paratrooper whose chute snags on a church tower, and is forced to view the carnage as Germans annihilate jumpers dropping into a French town square; and John Wayne (himself a war film icon), as Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, the Airborne commander, who impatiently waits for the 'Go' order, then breaks his ankle jumping into Normandy.
Filled with drama, humor, and pathos, 'The Longest Day' works on many levels, and is never dull! Over forty years after its initial release, it's semi-documentary style still seems as fresh and engrossing as ever, and works equally well viewed by itself, or paired with 'Saving Private Ryan'.
It should be an essential part of your film library!",Null,15,16,9 August 2003
Total Recall," Schwarzenegger and Verhoeven's Martian Epic...
","One of the biggest fans of Paul Verhoeven's extremely violent and stylish SF classic, ROBOCOP, was Arnold Schwarzenegger. Knowing that their artistic temperaments would mesh perfectly, Schwarzenegger promised the Dutch director that when he found the 'right' property, they would make a film together. TOTAL RECALL became their 'dream' collaboration, and stands today as one of the most popular and successful SF films ever made.From his first reading of an early draft of the script, very loosely based on Philip K. Dick's novel 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale', Schwarzenegger was confident of it's potential, but had to wait for Dino De Laurentiis, who owned the rights, to decide what to do with the property. When the Italian producer decided against filming it, the action star bought the script, then used his leverage to get Carolco Pictures and TriStar to finance the production, with himself in the lead, and Verhoeven to direct.
The script, while very good, needed a lot of work ('It lacked a strong third act,' as Verhoeven put it), and a number of writers, credited and uncredited, contributed to the end result, with Gary Goldman doing rewrites on the set, daily. A fabulous cast was assembled, including ROBOCOP alum Ronny Cox (again playing the villain), Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, and, in her breakout role, Sharon Stone as Schwarzenegger's 'wife'. Despite having done nude scenes before, Stone shyly balked at Verhoeven's request to 'show some skin' in a bed scene with Schwarzenegger ('I got her back in BASIC INSTINCT', the director would joke). Shot at Carolco's studio in Mexico, the production proved rigorous but enjoyable, with Schwarzenegger keeping the atmosphere light and productive.The story combines many classic SF elements (brainwashing, virtual reality, mutants, interplanetary war, ancient alien civilizations and technology), served up with Verhoeven's unique brand of graphic violence and sexuality, and Schwarzenegger's humor and brawny action. As 'Douglas Quaid', a construction worker on Earth who has dreams of a totally different life on Mars, he would discover that his entire life, including his marriage and even his name, were all an elaborate lie. In his search for his 'true' past, 'Quaid' would become a hunted man on two planets, and a tool for both sides in a conflict to determine the ultimate destiny of humanity on Mars.Although the 'science' of the film is farfetched (terraforming a planet in minutes stretches credibility!), the story is fast-paced and spectacular, and would become a major box office hit, worldwide.And with Verhoeven and Stone moving on to BASIC INSTINCT, and Schwarzenegger's follow-up projects KINDERGARTEN COP and TERMINATOR II, TOTAL RECALL heralded the start of the most successful period of each of their careers.",Null,0,2,14 February 2004
Love Actually," A Delight, Not to be Missed!
","LOVE ACTUALLY is one of the sweetest, most audience-friendly films I've viewed in quite a while. A tale of 8 relationships during the weeks before Christmas, it manages to give each subplot not only humor, but also humanity and compassion, as well. You care about all of the characters, and they are so deserving of happiness that you can't help but root for them to succeed.While all the stories are well-done, three are my favorites; Hugh Grant, as the new, charismatic Prime Minister, discovering the void in his life is being filled by the klutzy staffer he has to transfer (Martine McCutcheon); Colin Firth, learning Spanish so he can propose to the girl (Lúcia Moniz) who helped him recover from a cheating girlfriend; and Laura Linney, as a woman whose romantic aspirations are put on hold by a mentally ill brother (the only subplot without a happy ending...although the Alan Rickman/Emma Thompson subplot is iffy!)With a memorable pop music soundtrack, some funny cameos (Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thornton shine), and a London that is shimmering and nearly too beautiful to be true, LOVE ACTUALLY will be a film that will DEFINITELY grace my DVD collection.This IS the perfect 'date' movie!",Null,0,2,24 April 2004
Tombstone," A Terrific Homage to Classic Westerns!
","TOMBSTONE, one of two epic westerns about Wyatt Earp released within a few months of each other (1993-94) lacks the lyrical, 'warts-and-all' quality of Kevin Costner's WYATT EARP, but is a more successful film, with tighter pacing, more clearly drawn characters, and a reverence to the genre that has made it the most popular Western of the last twenty years.From the opening scene, narrated by the legendary Robert Mitchum, a nod to the great Hollywood Westerns of the past is evident; a gang of outlaws calling themselves 'The Cowboys' break up a Mexican wedding in a small town, ruthlessly killing nearly all the men, including village priest Pedro Armendáriz Jr. (son of the legendary Western actor), in a scene reminiscent of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Led by two of Hollywood's flashiest character actors, swaggering Powers Boothe, and coldly psychotic Michael Biehn (playing Johnny Ringo), the presence of such pure evil sets the stage for the Earps' arrival in Tombstone.A powerful cast is essential for a great Western, and you couldn't find a better group of actors as the Earp brothers; Kurt Russell, chiseled, squinty-eyed, and razor-thin, is an ideal Wyatt; Sam Elliott, one of Hollywood's best Western actors, plays Virgil with a growl but a twinkle in his eye; and Bill Paxton, soon to achieve stardom in APOLLO 13 and TWISTER, makes a terrific Morgan. Then there is Val Kilmer, as Doc Holliday...While Dennis Quaid, in WYATT EARP, gave the most realistic portrayal of the dying dentist-turned-gambler/gunfighter ever recorded on film (he was superb), Kilmer, relying on bloodshot eyes, an ambiguous sexuality, and a Brando-esque line delivery, literally steals TOMBSTONE, and has become the 'Doc' everyone remembers. He is so charismatic that you nearly forget that the Earps are the focus of the story! Watch for his early scene confronting a shotgun-wielding (and chubby!) Billy Bob Thornton (three years before SLING BLADE), out to kill Wyatt, and you'll see my point.The events leading up to the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral are clearly and decisively presented, from Wyatt's first meeting with future wife Josie (Dana Delany), to the murder of Tombstone's Marshal (Harry Carey, Jr., son of another legendary Western star, and a staple of many John Ford films), which leads to Virgil taking the badge and making his brothers (in Wyatt's case, reluctantly) deputies, to the friction with Ike Clanton (GODS AND GENERALS' Stephen Lang) that explodes into the short but bloody shootout that became legendary.Where TOMBSTONE and WYATT EARP both excel is in presenting the aftermath of the gunfight. Unlike MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, the true story doesn't tie up neatly with a happy ending at the Corral, but becomes darker and bloodier. The Earps are placed under house arrest, and after they are acquitted in court, friends of Clanton (in TOMBSTONE, Ringo and other Cowboys), cold-bloodedly murder Morgan and cripple Virgil. Wyatt explodes, and grimly sets about, with Holiday and a small band of gunmen, to execute every possible Clanton ally he can find ('You tell him I'm coming! And hell's coming with me!'). Becoming a wanted fugitive himself, he only stops his mission of vengeance long enough to take the ailing Holiday to a friend's cabin (Charlton Heston has a brief but memorable cameo as the rancher), but the gambler returns in time for the gunblazing climax of the film.TOMBSTONE is the kind of Western that critics love to say aren't made anymore, a throwback to the golden days of Ford and Hawks, when Good and Evil were clearly defined. Director George P. Cosmatos grew up on those films, as well as those of Sergio Leone, and he said, of TOMBSTONE, that it was made to honor the Westerns he loved so much.It is his love of the Western that makes TOMBSTONE a truly superior film!",Null,221,267,27 August 2003
Identity," Psychological Thriller Will Have You Guessing!
","It's nearly impossible to review James Mangold's latest film, IDENTITY, without revealing the plot twist that makes this very enjoyable thriller 'work'...and since the director chose not to reveal it, himself, until the film was nearly over, I'll respect his vision, and not give it away!Two story lines unfold; in one, psychiatrist Alfred Molina has a final session with convicted serial killer Pruitt Taylor Vince, before execution. Despite the defense claiming insanity, the court ruled against it, and the bitterness towards the murderer, and satisfaction the prosecution feels about justice being served are clearly evident, making Molina's task a nearly impossible one.In the other, a chain of events strands a group of motorists together at a seedy motel, run by John Hawkes (who is excellent as the sleazy manager) during a storm. Composed of a hooker (Amanda Peet), who, with a lost shoe, began the chain; a nerdish husband (John C. McGinley), his wife, seriously injured after being struck by a car, and his stepson; the chauffeur (John Cusack) who struck the woman, and his passenger, a fading movie star (Rebecca DeMornay, who is nearly unrecognizable); a bickering young couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); and a marshal, transporting a killer (Ray Liotta and Jake Busey). With the roads flooded and phone lines down, the group is isolated...then, in a fashion similar to Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, people begin to die! It becomes a race against time to discover who the murderer is...The two story lines intertwine in a very surprising manner, making IDENTITY far superior to the 'by-the-numbers' gore-fests that pass themselves off as 'suspense', with the climactic twist a stunning revelation that is VERY effective!If you like your films challenging, you're in for a treat...IDENTITY delivers!",Null,0,0,1 September 2003
Rear Window," Hitchcock's Classy Voyeurism Thriller...
","One of the joys of Alfred Hitchcock films is his ability to take social taboos, present them in an enticing context, throw in major stars we know and respect to perform them, and thus make abhorrent behavior seem attractive! 'Vertigo' is the best-known example of this Hitchcock trait ('Psycho' also comes to mind), but 'Rear Window' is arguably the most fun to watch, because of the appealing combination of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.Stewart is a photographer, laid-up while recuperating from an accident (cleverly shown through photographs in his studio), who, out of boredom, begins spying on his neighbors through binoculars. Virtuous Jimmy Stewart a 'Peeping Tom'? Only Hitchcock could get away with this!Of course, Kelly, as his high fashion model girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter (who is fabulous as his nurse), are appalled by Stewart's behavior, but are drawn into voyeurism by Stewart's devotion to it, particularly after he witnesses an apparent murder (committed by Raymond Burr, in one of the most wonderfully EVIL roles of his career).The film takes on a cat-and-mouse intensity, as Stewart attempts to prove Burr's guilt to his skeptical policeman buddy (nicely played by Wendell Corey). To add a touch of sexual foreplay to the proceedings, Kelly models a variety of '50s evening and nightwear, while teasing the injury-constrained Stewart ('Previews of Coming Attractions', she purrs). All this leads up to a fabulous, claustrophobic finale, with camera flashes, and a twist ending that is pure Hitchcock magic. If you haven't seen 'Rear Window', run, do not walk to your video store, and rent it! You'll quickly discover why it is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular films!",Null,6,10,16 August 2003
A Walk to Remember," Squeaky Clean Does NOT Equal Good!
","I've been told that 'A Walk to Remember' should be forgiven for its multitude of faults because a)It has a positive Christian message for teens, and b)It's a 'Chick Flick', and, for some reason, that makes leaps of logic somehow acceptable. Personally, both arguments, to me, demean the groups referred to. A good film stands on its own merits; a bad film, and this one is a stinker, should not be rationalized away by saying it's target audience expects less!'A Walk to Remember' opens with the world's most clean-cut 'gang' of overprivledged kids busting into an abandoned warehouse complex at night (shades of 'Footloose'), then daring a kid as a rite of initiation to dive from a tower into a sinkhole of water (shades of 'Breaking Away'). Conned by the charismatic leader (Shane West), the kid jumps, and is badly injured. Naturally, the police immediately arrive, and West is busted, for staying with the kid. As punishment, he is given probation, community service time...and he has to JOIN the DRAMA CLUB!!! (This is PUNISHMENT for nearing KILLING a kid???) In the Drama Club is school geek and Born-Again Christian Mandy Moore, who you can tell is 'The Good Girl' because she carries a Bible, doesn't wear makeup, and is wardrobe-challenged! From her soulful glances at him, and his arrogant smile in reply, you know that True Love is only a few plot-twists away. It takes Opening Night to provide the catalyst, though...apparently, this club doesn't believe in dress rehearsals, because when she walks onstage, in makeup, and a slinky dress with no underwear (one wonders how her minister father approved of THAT!), and sings to West, as the male lead (yes, despite having no acting ability, or experience, he gets the lead in the play), he sees how hot she is for the first time, and falls for her.She warns him NOT to fall in love with her (ah, could there be a secret she's not sharing? DUH!), but he follows her around, anyway, even to the cemetery where she stargazes with her telescope at night. (This sets up one of the most brain-dead scenes of the film; he asks to see Pluto, to which she replies that it doesn't rise until two hours before sunrise. 'I'll wait', he says...In reality, Pluto is impossible to see in a small telescope...it wasn't even discovered until 1930, in an amazing piece of detective work...and this supposedly brilliant astronomy hobbyist doesn't know this??? As a Born-Again Christian, you KNOW she wasn't lying to get a night alone with West!)Eventually, Moore collapses, and it is revealed she is dying of cancer (shades of 'Here on Earth'), and, on her deathbed in the hospital, West proposes to her. His estranged doctor father pays to get her Home Care, for her last days...and the next scene, the couple are walking through the woods together, with Moore looking better than ever! (I believe in Love's healing powers, but this is a stretch, even for me!) The couple marry, and share a Summer of Love, before she finally dies (shades of 'Love Story'), and he, redeemed, goes on to ace Medical School (shades of 'Magnificent Obsession').The acting is uneven, at best; Shane West does a credible job, certainly better than Chris Klein did in the 'Walk' clone, 'Here on Earth'. Peter Coyote, as Moore's minister father, does what he can in a role that seems to have been 'lifted' from John Lithgow's in 'Footloose'. Daryl Hannah, nearly unrecognizable with dark hair, is quite good as West's mother. But the rave reviews Mandy Moore has received as the dying girl seem unjustified; no makeup and stilted line readings do NOT equal a great performance! In order for a film like this to work, you must believe the heroine, and the bittersweet nature of her love. I never got beyond the 'golly, look, Mandy Moore is acting' stage, and her delivery often had me wincing!
There ARE some great tearjerkers out there, both classic and contemporary...'A Walk to Remember' is just NOT one of them!",Null,1,2,29 August 2002
Cinderella Man," Crowe Superb in Extraordinary Film Bio...
","'Cinderella Man', Ron Howard's heart-felt film biography of boxing legend James J. Braddock, never received the recognition it deserved when first released, due, in large part, to Russell Crowe's bad press following a telephone-throwing incident. Overzealous critics tended to lump the incident and film together, and despite Crowe's public apology, many moviegoers skipped it. Now that the film is available on DVD, it's time to acknowledge the film for what it always HAS been; director Howard and star Crowe's FINEST film, together! Braddock's story is so amazing and inspirational, that it is astonishing that it's taken nearly sixty years to tell it. Sylvester Stallone 'borrowed' from it, extensively, in creating 'Rocky', and in viewing the film, the parallels between fact and fiction are obvious; Braddock had been an 'up and comer' in the twenties, but broken bones and ill-advised matches had cost him a championship. Then the Depression struck, Braddock was wiped out, financially, and he struggled to support his wife and family through the most harrowing period in American history. Considered 'washed up' and too old for a comeback, all the boxer had going for him was his wife's love, his manager's faith, and his personal integrity, which refused to allow him to give up. Slowly he climbed back up the ranks of younger contenders, earning the adoration of a country trying to rebuild their own lives, as well, until, finally, he had his championship match, against ruthless 'killing machine' Max Baer. Their match would become the stuff of legends! To director Howard's credit, he never 'over-sentimentalizes' the story, or tries to turn it into a soft-focus 'fairy tale'. His vision of the Depression is the most accurate and heartbreaking since the documentaries of the '30s, and will come as a revelation to those whose only knowledge of the period is a paragraph in a history book. Jim Braddock is not a 'Superman', but a hard-working, decent man with no higher vision than to provide his family a better life, and as magnificently portrayed by Crowe, he embodies qualities of honesty and dignity that many of us dream of, but seldom achieve. In any other year, he'd be a shoo-in for an Oscar for his performance, it's that good! Matching Crowe's portrayal are Renée Zellweger, as his loyal wife, Mae, who perfectly channels a '30s 'style', as well as a gutsiness that is timeless, and the wonderful Paul Giamatti, as manager Joe Gould, who would sell everything he owned, rather than see Braddock give up. Giamatti, a veteran character actor who finally saw his 'breakthrough' in last year's 'Sideways', should finally get his long-deserved Oscar, for this role.'Cinderella Man' is a film that will continue to be cherished long after the filmmakers are gone, a tale rooted in an earlier era, but still timeless.Movies just don't get better than this!",10,1,2,10 December 2005
The Island," Derivative, Yes, But Served Up By First-Rate Cast...
","No one will ever accuse director Michael Bay of making cutting-edge films, but he certainly knows how to put on a show, and when you add a cast of first-rate actors, the end result can be great fun. 'The Island', a 'concept' film that borrows liberally from 'THX 1138', 'Westworld', 'The 6th Day', 'Coma', 'Capricorn One', and especially 'Logan's Run', is basically lightweight fluff, the kind of entertainment where you bring out the popcorn and leave logic at the door. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; his 1998 SF epic, 'Armageddon', is one of the most entertaining 'dumb' movies of the past decade. With this film, however, Bay has set the bar to a whole new level! The concept, nearly a reworking of 'Logan's Run', is intriguing, if shaky. A vast underground laboratory of clones created to supply replacement parts for rich clients is run by smoothly evil Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean, who seems to have a corner on villainous roles, these days). Juiced up with steroid mixtures to bring them to adulthood quickly (a system that is, besides being impossible, downright risky for anybody planning to USE the parts!), false memories are implanted, and the clones, at the mental level of teens, live happy, if limited lives, believing themselves survivors of an ecological disaster, and dreaming of winning the lottery (in 'Logan's Run', it was 'Carousel') that will whisk them off to the only untouched haven on earth, 'The Island'. In truth, winning the lottery means you are about to be harvested for parts, but this is, of course, kept from them.But Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), has nagging questions, fueled by sympathetic staffer McCord (the always entertaining Steve Buscemi), and when his best friend, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson, looking far too beautiful for a program where sexual desire is 'eliminated') 'wins' the lottery, he discovers what her fate is REALLY to be...and the pair escape into the 'real' world, pursued by an army of hit men commanded by Djimon Hounsou.The chase is when the story really takes off, and it is as spectacular a series of stunts as has ever been staged for an action film. You may ask yourself how Lincoln is so proficient in driving skills (he can know these, instinctively, yet he DOESN'T comprehend SEX???), but if you don't allow logic to interfere with entertainment, you'll be in for a helluva ride! While the finale is another 'lift' (of the final scene of 'Logan's Run'), the characters are so likable, and the resolution is so satisfying that only the most cynical of viewers will be disappointed.Michael Bay has done it, again!",8,1,1,6 January 2006
