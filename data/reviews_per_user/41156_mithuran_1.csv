Scarface," Absolutely terrible
","I watched this movie for the first time just this year, I know I am super late but hey, everyone hyped this up to be the greatest gangster movie of all time, so I had to see it for myself. I was expecting a dark and gritty movie but ended up watching an amateur turd fest consisting of yelling, and crap acting.This movie was so bad I was shocked, like the acting by Pacino was awful he was so over the top, all he did was butcher the accent and swear a million times in each dialogue he uttered from his mouth. I know people have preferences and all but if you really want to see a good gangster movie about overcoming the odds and about drugs watch American Gangsters, 10 times better than this garbage.The supporting cast was such a downfall in this movie, the cast tried to make an impact but couldn't and after a while it was like just stop trying. AND WTF WAS THE ENDING SCENE where the sister begs to get railed by her brother and all of a sudden he is shooting 20 guys after sniffing a mountain of line???? I will never recommend this movie to anyone, if you want to see a good gangster film watch American Gangsters, Black Mass etc. based on true stories and are gritty to watch. This film was more of a comedy spoof rather than a gangster flick",1,0,10,25 November 2017
