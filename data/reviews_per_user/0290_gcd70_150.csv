The Rock," Full tilt but no surprises
","Incredibly formulaic thriller from the director of the equally contrived, though not as interesting, 'Bad Boys'. 'The Rock' manages to borrow from many other films of this genre, and though Jonathan Hensleigh's script has taken a slightly different tack - with an obsessive, determined mercenary who isn't all we believe him to be, and a new, hi-tech deadly weapon - the pic really offers little in the way of freshness and originality.Having said all that, director Michael Bay and his cast do manage to entertain us throughout the movie thanks to some well staged action sequences, great cinematography and special effects, as well as some sprightly thesping. Our director has made the most of the many explosive scenes, and the cast do well, involving the audience in the goings on.Nicholas Cage is likable as the every man come saviour of the world. Sean Connery isn't asked to stretch his talents a great deal, but one can never help but enjoy his presence. Backing these two up is a solid support cast including the little seen Michael Biehn ('Terminator' and 'Aliens'), the ever strong Ed Harris ('Apollo 13') and William Forsythe.'The Rock' comes recommended to those who enjoy full tilt, adrenalin pumping action without too many surprises.Saturday, September 7, 1996 - Knox District Centre",6,1,3,28 March 2008
The Blair Witch Project," Legend of the Blair Witch
","Writer-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez had this very clever, original idea of bringing this true story of three student film-makers attempt to film a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. Unfortunately, 'The Blair Witch Project' is ineffective when one knows the big secret of the whole affair. I am sure this would have scared the living daylights out of all those who were oblivious to the truth.The small cast really excel, yet I found their behavior often frustrating, rather than being spooked by the situation.Saturday, March 18, 2000 - Video",6,0,1,4 June 2010
The Mask," Painful doesn't come into it!
","One question. How is it that Jim Carrey became a household name producing garbage like this? Director Chuck Russell's 'Nightmare on Elm Street 3' was not nearly as scary as this is stupid.Pathetic plot concerns a drop kick bank clerk's change in fortune when he stumbles upon a mysterious mask which alters and enhances the personality while controlling one's actions. Soon Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) finds he's the most popular guy in town, not only chased by a knockout blonde (Cameron Diaz) but also the cops and a nasty gangster.'Mask' is simply a no rules, slapstick gone mad flick which relies entirely on the manic Jim Carrey and some wacky special effects. Carrey fits the bill and the f/x team do just fine, but absolutely none of it is ever funny, and isn't that the idea?I can honestly say I was tempted many times to halt the tape and give up, but I persevered for some inexplicable reason. My reward was seeing out the most baffling box office hit of recent years. Painful doesn't come into it!Saturday, November 23, 1996 - T.V.",1,8,37,2 April 2008
Saturday Night Fever," Silly and drab
","John Badham ('Stakeout', 'Bird on a Wire', 'The Hard Way', Short Circuit', 'Blue Thunder' and 'War Games'), yes John Badham, directed this semi-cult film about disco king Tony Manero (John Travolta), a hardware man by day, at night (especially Saturday night) a guru on the dance floor who can boogie down like no other.Travolta sure can dance, and his smooth moves will either bring back fond memories, or leave you laughing in the aisles. So too the fashions, with the silky shirts, bell bottoms and platforms all looking hilariously ridiculous. There are, however, few other positives, except perhaps the Bee Gees' groovy soundtrack, with such hits as 'Stayin' Alive' and 'More Than a Woman'.Backdrop to this 70's hype is a drama involving Tony's gang, family traumas and his pursuit of a beautiful and sophisticated dancer named Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney). All this remains in the background as John Badham does not allow Norman Wexler's script to develop in any way, and some very interesting characters, who appear to be real people, are not allowed to come to life. A real shame, as 'Saturday Night Fever' could have been a strong melodrama, with some potentially solid performances just crying out to be given equal time.Badham decided that disco fever would carry the movie alone, and at the time, it was a most shrewd decision. Sixteen years on, the same is not true, and most audiences will find 'Saturday Night Fever' a bit silly, drab and even somewhat crass.Saturday, September 17, 1994 - Valhalla Cinema",4,2,6,23 January 2008
Vertigo," Intriguing but overlong
","Fantastic plotting and some fairly solid acting is spoiled only by poor editing in this very traditional Hitchcock thriller.The storyline is a fascinating one about an ex-detective who suffers from acrophobia, but comes out of retirement to help a friend who is concerned about his wife's health. Unfortunately the whole movie is far too drawn out and takes too long to get anywhere at all. If it were a little faster paced it would have been a real edge of the seat thriller.Still, the plot twists are bound to surprise the average viewer, and fans of the master won't be disappointed, or at least not too much.Tuesday, September 29, 1992 - Video",6,0,4,15 October 2007
Alien 3," Ripley Vs. Alien
","This third installment in the series that has seen our heroine 'Ripley' pitted against the deadly 'Alien' was originally rumoured to be in the hands of Ridley Scott. Since then though it has passed through the hands of Renny Harlin and Vincent Ward, while David Fincher finally completed it.His film is not unlike Scott's ('Alien'), as we find ourselves in very similar surrounds and confines, facing just one creature. Fincher wastes no time creating tension with the very clever beginning to the film, and the climax includes some well-shot chase sequences.Sigourney Weaver is again very convincing in a movie that dispenses with suspense and fast becomes a 'Ripley vs. the Alien' feature. However Fincher never fails to show us the gruesome reality of the monster.Much of the credit must go to the scripting here though, even if we have to allow for some minor plot inconsistencies. 'Alien 3' is a more than satisfactory finale to 'Ripley's' confrontation with the 'Alien'.Sunday, June 28, 1992 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase",7,2,17,19 September 2007
Gremlins," Loads of fun
","Clever and cute, nasty and vicious, funny and rampant. These words not only describe the movie 'Gremlins', but also the furry little creatures themselves.Yes, it's another huge commercial success from the Spielberg production company. 'Gremlins' is in fact a very funny 'E.T.' gone wrong as the once cute and cuddly Mogwai 'Gizzmo' spawns several not so nice offspring which proceed to destroy the peaceful town of Kingston Falls. Chris Columbus' story is inventive, and Joe Dante's direction (very much tongue in cheek) is effective as the creatures, both nasty and nice, proceed to steal the show from the main players. Special mention to the f/x crew and Jerry Goldsmith's score.Entertaining and loads of fun.Sunday, August 15, 1993 - T.V.",7,0,2,29 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just Not Star Wars
","Even the cast don't sit right, do they? Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor waving light sabers around - doesn't really work. Even if you don't like Mark Hamil, he is the only Jedi. Call me a purist, I don't care. Where are Han and Chewie, blasting their way out of trouble, or out-maneuvering a Star Destroyer in the Falcon? I know comparisons are unfair, but I can't help it. John Williams' fab music returns - yeah- and good old Master Yoda is there too, along with Jabba and our old friend the Emporer. Even Darth Vader, albeit a young Vader, makes his debut.I did struggle with the amount of technology present some two generations before the original Star Wars. Of particular note were the amazing 'destroyers', indestructible weapons that did not appear in episodes four to six. Surely they weren't discontinued; they were deadly. Maybe the manufacturing company went broke. Otherwise great f/x and sound, and some good action sequences grace this film. The pod race was the definite highlight - note the game is already in the stores.Saturday, June 12, 1999 - Knox District Centre",6,2,7,22 April 2010
The Sound of Music," I survived the classic musical
","I must stress yet again the fact that I don't like musicals, therefore I have avoided for years films such as this Academy Award winning 'classic'. Finally though, I have subjected myself to it, and survived.Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II have written some real show stoppers including the title track, 'Do-Re-Mi', 'My Favourite Things', 'Climb Every Mountain' and the traditional 'Edelweiss'. All these catchy memorable tunes cannot dress up this predictable romance about an inept nun whose penchant appears to be with kids rather than for service to God in an abbey. Overlong and self-indulgent, it may have been the order of the day in the mid-60's, but not today. Only entertainment lies in Miss Andrew's splendid voice and the fun loving music.Political overtones may also be out of place, and if you want to get picky, though the cast do well, nobody portrays an Austrian very convincingly. Screenwriter Ernest Lehmann, along with director Robert Wise, has been very true to the stage musical, which undoubtedly pleased its legions of fans.Boris Leven's production design is grand, cinematography (Ted McCord and Paul Beeson) in the Austrian mountains is completely breathtaking, but the costumes are ridiculous.Saturday, October 7, 1995 - Video",5,4,16,26 February 2008
Ghost," Ghost of a chance
","Interesting drama/mystery/love story only spoiled by hocus-pocus and ridiculous ideas of heaven and hell, and, funnily enough, ghosts.'Ghost' may have been more effective, if less popular, filmed straight down the line as a mystery-drama. Imagine: Pleasant love story takes a dark twist when Swayze is killed accidentally, or was he........You might say that would have been dull, but it would have saved the movie going off on a foolish tangent.Nevertheless, 'Ghost' works well enough as a tear jerker, with a very funny performance by Whoopi Goldberg. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore made a lovely couple.Sunday, May 12, 1991 - Greater Union Melbourne",6,1,4,20 May 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Original Adventure Film
","This is the original adventure film! Steven Spielberg's homage to those fantastic cliff hanger serials of the 30's and 40's is exciting and action-packed as we follow dare devil archaeologist Indiana Jones across several continents as he searches for the Lost Ark of the Covenant.George Lucas and Phillip Kaufman's script is fantastic, very funny, and all of its marvelous characters are spot on. Harrison Ford is wonderful as our hero Dr. Jones, adding the right amount of bravado and seriousness to the role, whilst Karen Allen makes a very good feisty heroine as Marion Ravenwood. Also lending great support are Denholm Elliot as Indy's confidant Dr. Brody, John Rhys-Davies as good friend Sallah, Ronald Lacey as the ruthless Toht and Paul Freeman as adversary Belloq, a French archaeologist who has an equal interest in the Ark.Spielberg's film is the epitome of adventure, and his direction suits the movie down to the ground. And the action is great fun as we cheer each time Indiana squeezes out of yet another thrilling tight spot, though never unscathed! Rounding off this very entertaining film is Michael Kahn's professional editing and John Williams' rousing, triumphant score which is instantly recognisable and, as Spielberg himself has said, 'the heartbeat' from which this film flows. Special effects and stunts are also very impressive.Thursday, December 30, 1993 - Astor TheatreUnsurpassed as a classic genre piece and perhaps the most fantastic adventure flick of all time is Steven Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. A roller coaster ride of thrills and spills, it follows the exploits of daredevil archaeologist Indiana Jones from the treacherous jungles of South America to the searing deserts of Egypt as he searches for the Lost Ark of the Covenant in which the Hebrews kept the sacred stone tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments.George Lucas' story is enthralling and oft times very funny, while Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay is well balanced and true to the fine script. Spielberg keeps the movie fast-paced while still allowing enough of the plot to sift through, Harrison Ford is ideally cast and crafts a memorable screen hero with his world weary, cynical and sharp performance. Karen Allen's portrayal of strong willed heroine Marion Ravenwood is impressive, Paul Freeman is most enjoyable as Indy's arch rival Rene Belloq, and the rest of the support cast (including John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliot and Ronald Lacey) are also marvellous.Add to this superb craftsmanship the editing skills of Michael Kahn, the art direction/set decoration prowess of Norman Reynolds, the costume design which brings 1936 brilliantly back to life and the highly charged and exciting score from the pen of John Williams, and you have a most memorable film.One can even forgive the razzle dazzle finale depicting the Wrath of God as He closes the lid on the Nazis. Though excessive, it is spectacular. Definitely no other complaints about a picture show that's infinitely watchable.Sunday, August 28, 1994 - Video",8,1,2,12 December 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A cinema experience worth having!
","Steven Spielberg, at the height of his illustrious career, brought to the screen the most loved, fabulous and appealing fantasy of cinematic history.Melissa Mathison's story, of a stranded alien who is befriended by a young boy who determines to help him 'phone home', is simplicity itself. The cast are wonderful and very complimentary, while 'E.T.' is realistically brought to life by some impressive special effects. The film is also technically sharp, and features a marvelous score from maestro John Williams, whose operatic composition is one of his best.But the real credit must go to master director Spielberg, who has indeed crafted this film into a fabulous piece of entertainment. He alone makes the whole movie come together and work to perfection. And the way he endears us to both the cast and 'E.T.' himself (by no means an adorable creature) is amazing.Finally, it must be stressed that this heart rending and indeed very funny film should only be seen at the movies (I was lucky enough to see it six times on the big screen). 'E.T' is a cinema experience worth having, whereas on video it loses much of its enchantment and wonder. A true masterpiece from a fine director.Wednesday, October 14, 1992 - VideoEven this perennial fantasy-adventure does wear thin after many years and several viewings, although the main reason for the lack of captivation on my part is (as I've said many times before) the fact that 'E.T.' is nothing if not viewed on the big screen.Of course it is still an amazing journey into a world of hope, dreams and friendship, and a film Spielberg will probably never eclipse in terms of sheer wonderment.With John Williams' superbly telling score, and the movie's technical genius, it remains one of the best films of all time.Saturday, August 28, 1993 - T.V.",7,0,0,17 October 2007
Casablanca," They don't make 'em like they used to
","A much anticipated fiftieth anniversary and subsequent cinema re-release has meant that a new generation of movie-goers have been able to experience this classic film on the big screen.Michael Curtiz' film about the goings on at Rick's, a bar in 'Casablanca', during World War II is very entertaining thanks to the clever and funny screenplay and some good performances. Bogart's dry wit is marvelous as is his character, Claude Raines is very funny and the rest of the cast do well. In Curtiz' hands, the plot twists and comedy in the script work wonderfully. A film not to be missed. They don't make 'em like they used to.Friday, October 2, 1992 - Greater Union Russell Street, MelbourneSecond viewing of this academy award winning, timeless classic is not quite as magical as the first, however 'Casablanca' still remains wonderfully entertaining thanks to the sharp script and dialogue, the superb direction of Michael Curtiz and of course the marvelous performances from Humphrey Bogart, Claude Raines and the rest of the very funny characters at Rick's.In fact, this great War time love story is worth watching for Bogart's dry performance and Raines' hilarious showing alone.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Ground-breaking wizardry
","Technically amazing film, from the Spielberg production company and the phenomenally successful Disney owned Touchstone Pictures, which seamlessly has live action and animation interacting with each other.The plot finds our hero, Roger Rabbit, framed for murder, but by whom? Bob Hoskins plays detective Eddie Valiant, who finds himself helping Roger and his gorgeous wife (voice by Kathleen Turner) Jessica solve the crime. Hoskins and all the supporting cast do marvelously well, considering they had literally nothing to work with. The technical achievements are spectacular, having won four Academy Awards. PS Look for very funny cameos from Daffy and Donald, Mickey and Bugs.Sunday, April 19, 1992 - Video",6,3,4,6 September 2007
Chinatown," Cleverly woven tale
","Classic, old fashioned tale of murder and deceit is cleverly woven by formidable director Roman Ploanski. This, one of his most renowned and successful works, tells the story of private dick Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), who is embroiled in a scandal involving the LA water board after being used to frame its chief engineer.Well known writer Robert Towne has penned an involving plot which twists and turns and becomes ever more complex as the film goes on. A credit to him also are his three dimensional, well written characters that audiences will really appreciate. Nicholson (looking very young and fresh faced) is most convincing as the street wise p.i. who is determined to uncover the major players in a conspiracy that seems to reach farther and deeper than anyone ever suspected. Alongside him is a solid Faye Dunaway as the wife who slowly shifts from hopeless victim to definite suspect. The support these two leads get form John Huston (a most enjoyable turn), Perry Lopez and Burt Young is also most commendable.Wrapping up this entertaining fare are some striking sets and dapper costumes that bring 30's LA effectively and affectively to life, while Jerry Goldsmith's score is a memorable one. Really though, top accolades must go to director Polanski (who also made a cameo appearance) and screenwriter Towne (academy award winner for this) for fashioning such an intriguing yarn. Due note goes to a strong cast.Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video",7,1,3,25 March 2008
Se7en," Enough is enough!
","Enough is enough! This movie has taken the whole 'serial killer' genre too far! Though a very well made film, I cannot bring myself to label this entertainment, for it is just too sick. Perhaps the whole thing is getting too close to home, but unless these films start taking the responsibility of discouraging, or at the very least educating, then they really will have to stop.Scripter Kevin Walker and director David Fincher don't bother to send any messages, except perhaps that it is a very bent and warped world that we live in. In closing, Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) suggests that it is indeed not a nice world, but that it is worth fighting for. However we are never told why.Freeman and Brad Pitt make the most of their roles as two very different detectives pursuing a very disturbed individual, played in truly haunting fashion by Kevin Spacey. I for one though am getting sick of religious nuts. It seems almost every person that is portrayed as having a faith is also naturally mentally unstable. 'Chariots of Fire' is the only film I can think of that shows Christianity in a good light, yet the number of religious wackos in the movies is astounding.Fincher has given his pic a customary dark, wet look (not unlike his 'Alien3'), and he has thrown in some very strange, 'rock video' style credits. The cinematography is oft times riveting, and the make-up is particularly stomach churning, with some graphically gruesome murder scenes being recreated. At times it is hard to stay with this long, under-edited film.Let's see an end to this spate of 'serial killer' films that take no social obligation, or we may find life imitating art.Friday, February 23, 1996 - Astor Theatre",6,1,6,9 March 2008
Wayne's World," Sure is unique
","It's not at all hard to see why this early nineties comedy quickly became a huge cult hit with teenagers across the globe. Director Penelope Spheeris' off the wall approach coupled with the ridiculously silly script from Mike Myers ('Wayne'), Bonnie and Terry Turner, really helps 'Wayne's World' appeal to an audience fully prepared for cinema completely void of seriousness.Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are Wayne and Garth, two rockin' dudes from Aurora, Illinois who have their own TV. show which they broadcast from Wayne's basement. When ruthless entertainment executive Benjamin (Rob Lowe) sees the program, he signs the guys to a major network in the hope that he'll be able to exploit them and make lots of money. Meanwhile Wayne has fallen for the lead singer of a local heavy metal band (she's a Robo-babe). and Garth fantasises of one day getting up the nerve to talk to his dream woman, or perhaps even sing to her! Bursts of absolute hilarity (look for Wayne's 'Happy Birthday Mr. President') and segments of sheer stupidity leaves 'Wayne's World' inconsistent, but there's enough on going nutty humour to keep the viewer amused. Clever, tongue-in-cheek performances from the two leads and the supporting cast really help set the mood, while the whole movie's 'no set guidelines' tack allows director Penelope Spheeris to do anything she pleases, and she does just that.'Laverne and Shirley' get the royal treatment, as do many other telly and picture shows, and even Alice Cooper manages to send himself up. For something out of the ordinary, 'Wayne's World' sure is unique.Friday, September 16, 1994 - Astor Theatre",7,0,1,22 January 2008
The Big Lebowski," Misses the Mark
","The Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, have fired several shots here at another one of their obscure targets. In this instance, unlike the triumphs of 'Miller's Crossing' and 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowsky' misses the mark on most counts.It is hard to work out what the lads were actually up to here. This film contains the 'Coen' regulars such as a reluctant hero and a double twist in the plot, yet so much appears to be misplaced. Strange dreams containing trampolining nudes and giant bowling alleys, and a narrator come stranger played by Sam Elliott are all a little confusing. Maybe the Coens always wanted to work with the legendary Elliott; as for the weird dreams, well that's anybody's guess.Jeff Bridges is ideal as the dated 'dude', a throw back to the sixties when drugs and hippies were cool. Playing his close friend, John Goodman surprises as the short-fused Vietman-vet who specialises in getting the dude deeper into trouble. Other bizarre roles go to the sex-deviant bowler (John Turturro) and Peter Stormare as the ringleader of a German kidnapping group. Steve Buscemi, always fun, gets too little time on screen playing the third of the dude's trio.It is a shame 'The Big Lebowsky' didn't have the focus Coen brothers films normally have. The pic just tends too much towards fantasy to have any real impact.Friday, November 27, 1998 - Astor Theatre StKilda",5,4,9,21 March 2010
As Good as It Gets," Humanity in New York
","Humanity in New York. Who would have thought! Such is the focus however, of James L. Brooks' new feature 'As Good as it Gets' (co-scripted with story writer Mark Andrus).The plot involves three very ordinary people who are fighting the battle, against the world and themselves (mostly the latter), to get through a day at a time. Brooks and Andrus bring the three characters together, meticulously and lovingly moulding them into real people. It is this intricate, involved writing that makes the film so easy to relate to.Breathing wonderful life into these players are Jack Nicholson, in a typically superb, larger than life characterisation that is sure to win him a swag of awards; Helen Hunt, who probably looked to this role as her big chance to be taken seriously (and on this strong showing I think it's high time we did); and Greg Kinnear, whose own emotionally charged performance is a strong point of the film. Excellent in support are Shirley Knight as Hunt's incredibly dedicated mom and Cuba Gooding Jr as Kinnear's equally committed art dealer, Frank. Look out too for a pint-sized scene-stealer named 'Verdell'.Brooks ties it all up as only he can, presenting with characters that, though ranging from mildly irritating to severely annoying, you won't be able to resist.Saturday, March 7, 1998 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",7,1,2,28 August 2008
Shakespeare in Love," Shakespeare Encapsulated Beautifully
","Who could have imagined Shakespeare encapsulated better. This is Shakespeare modernised almost perfectly. A wonderful credit to writers Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, who have used their imaginations to recreate the time and circumstances in which the great bard may have been inspired to write 'Romeo and Juliet'.Stephen Warbeck's musical theme is enchanting and beautiful. The artful, creative sets are captured well by Richard Greatrex. Director John Madden allows the whole thing to flow smoothly.Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow is completely charming and totally convincing as Will's inspiration. Joseph Fiennes is persuasive too as the great poet suffering from writer's block. A wonderful support cast back these two up, including the marvellously funny Geoffrey Rush and the brilliantly talented Dame Judi Dench - strong as her royal highness, Queen Elizabeth.Monday, March 29, 1999 - Knox District CentreWonderfully scripted, delightfully acted comedy-romance about the way in which William Shakespeare may have been inspired to write 'Romeo and Juliet'. The success of this film is all in the writing, or almost all, as Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman have turned the love of Shakespeare and his language into a modern day tragic love story.Credit also to the amazing Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Dame Judi Dench and the rest of the marvellous cast. John Madden directs carefully yet with enough flair to keep this feast lively, while his team of costume designers and art directors dazzle us with their creations.Stephen Warbeck's rich, inspirational score is the cream on the cake.Saturday, January 22, 2000 - Video",8,3,5,4 April 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Hopefully the last
","Big Sig is back (cloned actually) in what I truly hope is the last in the 'Alien' series. French director Jean Pierre Jeunet helms this time, so the fourth instalment goes a little art-house. The style ends up a lot like a cross between the first three films.Sigourney Weaver is great, though she doesn't really get to be herself, literally. Winona Ryder does not get to do a lot as the surprise packet of the pic. Also stars Jeunet regular Ron Perlman and J.E. Freeman.Having to follow up on one of the most popular trilogies of all time, I guess Jeunet and crew have done good. In actuality, this movie is at its best only when in reminds us of past glories. Occasionally the music, or a familiar scene will relive for us a favourite episode in one of the earlier films. Only here does 'Alien Resurrection' inspire.Another sequel consigned to the shadows.Sunday, January 31, 1999 - Video",6,1,2,27 March 2010
12 Monkeys," Complex and Demanding
","Inspired by the 1962 French short film 'La Jetee', this complex, interwoven tale from the pen of David and Janet Peoples will not appeal to a particularly broad audience. It concerns a story that takes some concentration, and many viewers may not feel it worth the effort.Bruce Willis is an observer from the year 2035 who has been sent back to the 1990's to gather information about a virus that wiped out ninety-nine percent of the earth's population. He does very well with the role, playing a reluctant 'volunteer' who soon begins to take the view of psychiatrist Dr. Railly, who believes James Cole is out of his mind. As Railly, Madeleine Stowe impresses too, only beginning to believe Cole when he begins to doubt himself. A standout too is Brad Pitt, as the fruitcake son of a world renowned virologist (Christopher Plummer). Pitt earned himself an Academy Award nomination for this twisted turn.The Ridley Scottesque sets (reminiscent of 'Alien' and 'Bladerunner') are a treat for the eye, and the inspired art is from Art Director Jeffrey Beecroft. Paul Buckmaster provides some effective, French-inspired music.'Twelve Monkeys' would have to be considered bizarre, which would be in keeping with director Terry Gilliam's previous work. Personally, I loved the way Gilliam brought the whole film together, milking the script for all the fascination and tension it contained. The plot is cleverly drawn out, and you're never quite sure what is reality, what is not, nor what may happen next. Gilliam is careful to maintain the feeling of hope, a way out for humanity, the possibility of an eleventh hour salvation or self-resurrection. We never know what the outcome will be. Themes of humanity's downward spiral and questions on the truth about mental illness permeate the film.For people who seek films that are demanding, different and thought-provoking, this is a great sample.Sunday, June 7, 1998 - VideoAlthough the first time viewer will get the most out of this, I am still wowed by this film even second time around. For those who don't enjoy complex, sometimes confusing movies, you ought to forget 'Twelve Monkeys'. If, on the other hand, you love deep, thought provoking pics which tackle heavy subjects, this if for you.The subject of time travel has always fascinated me, and Terry Gilliam's flick is not only a classy piece of entertainment, but an interesting study on the time travel theorem as well. Gilliam handles with gripping expertise an ingenious plot from David and Janet Peoples (adapted from the short French film 'La Jetee').Amazing in the lead role is Bruce Willis, perfect as the convict James Cole, who is sent 'back' to 1996 to gather information. Madeleine Stowe also impresses as the psychiatrist who is baffled by Cole's apparent alternate reality. Manic in support is the talented Brad Pitt as the leader of the loony 'army of the twelve monkeys'. He becomes a bit much on second viewing though. Also stars Christopher Plummer.Jeffrey Beecroft's production design is stark and affronting, and it is skillfully photographed by Roger Pratt. Astute editing comes from Mick Audsley and Paul Buckmaster's score ideally captures the theme. A must.Wednesday, February 3, 1999 - Video",8,0,0,7 April 2009
Mississippi Burning," Shocking, Powerful, Disturbing and Upsetting
","Shocking, powerful, disturbing, upsetting and downright aggravating. All these words describe Alan Parker's film of the terrible injustice that was inflicted upon the Negro population in Mississippi, 1964. Though this was hardly an isolated incident. The fact is, white people have been oppressing minorities for as long as man can remember, and not just the African Americans who were captured and enslaved back in the 18th and 19th centuries. White man has marched through innumerable countries, taking over completely, and then either driving out or killing off the indigenous people. India, Australia, South Africa and North America are just a few examples.I do not believe the decent people of today ought to apologise for the actions of their forefathers, as much as they should be determined that equality rules this small planet we all share. Everyone hails from the same supreme Creator, who chose for his own reasons to colour our skins differently, and separate us into cultures. That does not mean we have the right to harm or kill those whom we fear, envy or otherwise do not understand. Jesus asks us to love one another as He love us. What we do to one another must make Him weep. And remember, Jesus was born an olive-skinned Jew, not a white Anglo-Saxon.Parker has fashioned a film which ruthlessly drives home the point that even if racism and bigotry is taught, or a learned behaviour, that it in no way can or should be tolerated nor condoned. It is as ugly as sin, and perhaps one of the most malignant and self-destructive illnesses of humankind, which threatens to eat away the very fabric of humanity even now, on the eve of the 21st century.Gene Hackman gives one of his best performances (possibly ever), as FBI agent Rupert Anderson, a tough old Mississippi boy who recognises racism for what it is, a disease. He'll stop at nothing, including making the rules up as he goes, to halt the injustice and bring the culprits in. Alan Ward is his by the book partner (played with true conviction by the ever underrated Willem Dafoe), a young ex-Justice Department hot shot whose aggressive passion is overshadowed only by his strong regard for Bureau procedure. These two leads are nothing less than outstanding. Entire support carries great weight too, with Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey and Gailard Sartain all leaving marked impressions. Trevor Jones provides a most effective music score, Gerald Hambling some expert editing, while the costume design team and art crew (lead by Philip Harrison and Geoffrey Kirkland) reproduce this turbulent time very convincingly.Chris Gerolmo's script (the historical accuracy of which is hotly disputed) does not paint a picture of purely good versus evil. There are no clear black and white boundaries depicted here, no innocents, just much grey area. But it's perfectly clear who the defenceless victims are. Maybe Gerolmo wrote this in the hope of educating us. Perhaps he hopes, as I do, that racism will one day be merely an ugly stain in history. Yet as of today, 1995, this is not so.Sunday, October 8, 1995 - VideoPowerful, powerful drama of the atrocity of racial abuse in America's deep south. Scripter Chris Gerolmo pulls no punches in his controversial tale and director Alan Parker ('Midnight Express') has a hard hitting style that will rivet you.Trevor Jones' music is poundingly effective and editor Gerald Hambling is precise and efficient. Best thing about this great film is the 'tour de force' performances from Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, each bringing to life two very different federal agents, both of whom are determined to put away the men responsible for murdering an African-American boy and two Jewish social workers in Mississippi.This team of experts have created a must see, compelling picture which will leave an indelible impression.Tuesday, January 14, 1997 - Video",9,1,1,26 February 2008

","Perhaps this fifth movie in he series will be the final 'Rocky'? You never know I guess. Yet this fourth sequel is far more entertaining than the previous film, 'Rocky IV'.This time original director John G. Avildsen and writer/star Sylvester Stallone take us back to the heart of Rocky and what he stands for, the people. It's good entertainment, and we touch on the human side of Rocky we've missed for a while.Talia Shire, Burt Young and Burgess Meredith all return.

12 Angry Men," Rewarding and thought provoking
","A youth from an underprivileged home stands trial for the murder of his father with whom he had a strained relationship. Circumstantial evidence seems to have convicted him beyond any shadow of a doubt. Yet as the jury retires to consider its verdict, one man chooses to look further than the boy's background, and in examining the prosecution's case, he finds both the 'proof' and the witnesses to be less than satisfactory.Reginald Rose's compelling story is first and foremost an excellent character study of '12 Angry Men' who all find their moral fibre put to the test when asked to decide the fate of a young street kid accused of a terrible crime. Each from very different backgrounds, the audience witnesses first hand as every man's true character comes to the fore under such pressure. The film also examines mankind's prejudices toward not only the youth of today, but also the less fortunate and the ethnic community.Director Sidney Lumet ('Murder on the Orient Express') creates tension and claustrophobia very well in the small, hot jurors room where the '12 Angry Men' struggle with both their verdict and their own moral values and personal convictions.The whole cast is very solid, especially Henry Fonda who delivers a stand out performance as the architect who just isn't convinced of the boy's guilt, and slowly but surely he starts to win some support for his arguments. Also superb is Lee J. Cobb as a bitter and biased man who is determined the lad should hang. Great support too from Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, EG Marshall and Jack Warden. A most rewarding and thought provoking movie.Sunday, February 19, 1995 - Astor Theatre",7,4,6,7 February 2008
The English Patient," Superb in almost all respects
","'The English Patient' is superb in almost all respects. A lavish production that is a feast to the eye, it is a credit to the immensely creative talents of producer Saul Zaentz ('Amadeus') and visionary director Anthony Minghella.Special effects and stunts are most convincing, and amazing sound supports this where it matters. Costumes are spot on in recreating the late thirties and early forties, while the production design is nothing short of superlative. John Seale's camera sweeps us through this tale of love and war with grand style, capturing some marvellous footage.writer/director Minghella has set out to make an epic of Michael Ondaatje's war time novel, and cleverly he surrounded himself with the people who could pull it off. Along with producer Zaentz and a brilliant technical team, he has an outstanding cast.Ralph Fiennes ('Schindler's List' and 'Quiz Show') is far and away the outstanding talent in all the movies in which I have had the pleasure of watching him perform. Not to say his co-stars are poor, it is just that he is so strong. Once again he personifies brilliantly the character of Count Laszlo de Almasy, the hardened Austrian explorer whose mastery of languages is only surpassed by his archaeological expertise. Sturdy in support is Kristin Scott Thomas, as Katherine Clifton, the passionate lover who stirs the Count's emotions to life. Juliette Binoche gives an Academy Award winning performance as Hana, the Canadian army nurse who cares for the critically injured Almasy as he gradually recalls the past. Ever reliable Willem Dafoe is Canadian undercover agent Moose, who blames the Count for a wrong he suffered during the war. Cast also includes Jurgen Prochnow, Colin Firth and Naveen Andrews.The only disappointing part of this film is the shaky plot and lack of characterisation. Minghella's screenplay is never strong, nor is it important enough to be an epic. The characters are poorly developed and hard to empathise with. Not enough background is supplied to explain their actions and reactions. And another thing, I am getting tired of passionate love affairs that involve infidelity. Why is it that nearly all of cinema's great lovers are adulterous? Don't married couples love with vigour? Not according to the movies apparently. In 'The English Patient', the lover is portrayed as the hero, and the husband as an obsessive, boring old sop. And that is just one of two affairs in the film. Add to that a plug for euthanasia, and immorality just is not in it. Hardly the picture of the year, though it does look like and epic.Sunday, June 8, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",7,0,2,12 June 2008
Batman Returns," Great to look at
","Tim Burton's sequel to his 1989 hit movie manages to be only slightly better than the original, if only because we are spared the Jack Nicholson show.'Batman Returns' does have a deal more action, which is good. The plot in between time, however, is fairly dull even though it is original. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a good 'Catwoman', but Danny De Vito and Christopher Walken are only okay as 'The Penguin' and power hungry industrialist 'Max Schreck' respectively. Of course Keaton returns as our masked hero, but we do not see a lot of him.The film's main plus is its visual splendour, as we once again have some great sets and special effects to look at.Saturday, July 4, 1992 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase",5,0,3,1 October 2007
Dead Poets Society," Beautifully made, tragically ruined
","Beautifully made drama about a group of young private school boys who are challenged by their unorthodox English teacher to 'seize the day' and 'make their lives extraordinary'.Peter Weir's strong picture remains uplifting almost to the very end thanks to Robin Williams' solid performance and some superb acting from the young supporting cast, including Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke and Kurtwood Smith. Technically the film is impressive too, with very good Art Direction/Set Decoration and John Seale's superb cinematography.Being youthful as they are, the lads take Mr. Keating's (Williams) sound doctrines a little too far as they begin to buck the system. And tragically the ending to the movie is a terrible miscalculation, being so depressing that it completely ruins this stirring motion picture, as it goes against the whole idea of the story - making the most of one's life.Tuesday, October 5, 1993 - Video",3,2,10,2 December 2007
Home Alone," Will warm your heart and make you laugh
","Absolutely hilarious film about an eight year old boy who is accidentally left 'Home Alone' by his parents (who have flown to Paris for Christmas), and so must fend for himself when his house is threatened by burglars.Macauley Culkin is enjoyable and sufficiently cute as the abandoned child, whilst Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are both very funny as the misfit crooks. Chris Columbus' film, written and produced by John Hughes, is a damn sight more impressive than his directorial debut, 'A Night on the Town', as he handles all the movie's moods well. And John Williams' catchy, Christmassy score caps it all off. This one's bound to warm your heart as well as make you laugh!Saturday, November 21, 1992 - VideoJohn Hughes' pleasant and humorous film doesn't really hit top gear until Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern come into the action, but when they do, things really get out of control, and the comedy from here on is hilarious.This is good old fashioned slapstick at its very best (Pesci and Stern are riotous), and even if the plot meanwhile isn't brilliant, it fills in time nicely enough. Very, very funny even on return viewing (far superior to the sequel).Tuesday, November 30, 1993 - Video",7,0,0,23 October 2007
L.A. Confidential," Stylish 50's crime flick does everything right
","Crime ala 50's is stylishly done by scripters, director and production designer alike. The flick looks great! Dante Spinotti's camera captures the action, sets and dapper outfits well.The story is an involving, multi-layered one about an unexplained gangland killing, and two young cops who approach their jobs in very different ways. Scripters Brian Helgeland, Curtis Hanson and James Ellroy (from his novel) show skill in the way they unfold the plot and simultaneously introduce us to the principal characters, explaining their motivations along the way.Hanson brings everything together very effectively, allowing the storyline to do most of the legwork, while using the intelligent players to full effect. He also gives the film a pleasing pace, and a near perfect length. Jerry Goldsmith adds a strong score.An excellent cast put the icing on the cake. It's great to see Aussies Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe carrying a pic like this. Pearce is strong in bringing to the screen Ed Exley, the good cop whose incorruptible stance is much akin to Kevin Costner's 'Eliot Ness' and Willem Dafoe's 'Special Agent Ward' from 'Mississippi Burning'. Crowe is perhaps even better as rough house cop Wendell 'Bud' White, who wholly convinces us he is a dangerous guy with a painful past. For mine, Crowe is the new Mel Gibson. Kevin Spacey is a delight as social climbing old boy Seargeant Jack Vincennes, and it's refreshing to see him in a more friendly role. Notable in support are James Cromwell as hardened Police Captain Dudley Smith and David Strathairn as a suspect entrepreneur. Good turns also from Danny De Vito and Kim Basinger.Saturday, November 8, 1997 - Knox District CentreClass act from director Hanson and a brilliant cast who all gobble each of their scenes with relish. Aussies Pearce and Crowe are both fantastic, and, at the risk of repeating myself, its great to see two lads from down under taking Hollywood by storm. Kevin Spacey is marvellous as the morally dubious Sargeant Jack Vincennes, and James Cromwell is a delight as the wise old captain to whom everybody looks for support. Kim Basinger and Danny De Vito are perfectly cast, while there is support from David Strathairn.Jerry Goldsmith adds a score that solidifies the plot, which was creatively adapted from James Ellroy's novel by Brian Helgeland, director Curtis Hanson and Ellroy himself.A real treat!Saturday, August 22, 1998 - Video",7,0,2,4 July 2008
The Terminator," Solid, excellent sci-fi/action
","Well, what can I say? Real 'knock your sox off' stuff from director James Cameron.'The Terminator' keeps you on the edge of your seat from early on and barely lets up. Cameron makes full use of a fantastically original and well-worked script (co-written by himself and producer Gale Ann Hurd), and the brilliantly choreographed action sequences.Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton and supporting cast are very believable, but Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly, and I mean perfectly, cast.

The Bodyguard," Costner's Midas Touch
","Definitely not one of Kevin Costner's stronger films, however he certainly seems to turn everything he touches into gold. His record of choosing successful scripts seems impeccable.In 'The Bodygaurd', Costner plays somewhat reluctant minder Frank Farmer, who is assigned to watch over Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), a celebrity of music and movie fame. Kevin Costner fills the shoes well, but he's never impressive, while always playing second fiddle to Whitney Houston, whose screen debut is good, but hardly great.Director Mick Jackson does manage to give his audience a good feeling in this film, which is best noted for Ms. Houston's wonderful title song.Saturday, February 13, 1993 - Croydon Twin Cinema",6,1,3,2 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Dramatically poor, but re-mastered this is visually exciting
","The closer in the central trilogy (episodes IV, V, VI of IX) was widely regarded as the weakest of the three 'Star Wars' films, and it's fairly obvious why. Being highly melodramatic, weakly plotted and poorly acted means 'Jedi' fails to inspire at crucial times where 'Empire' succeeded. Especially disappointing is Luke's confrontation with the Emperor, who in truth is a rather drab villain.On the up side is the fact that this digitally remastered version from ILM and Lucasfilm is a real treat when viewed on a widescreen in a theatre equipped for THX or Dolby/Sony Digital Sound. 'Jedi' features fantastic sound effects and some exciting action sequences. Highlights include the escape from the clutches of Jabba, the excellent speeder chase on Endor (sight and sound both brilliant) and the clashes between the all too cute Ewoks and the new, two legged Imperial Walkers. Even the assault on the new Death Star isn't bad, though the original 'Star Wars' trench run was much more thrilling.Certainly all these pluses made for me an enjoyable evening, especially in light of my lesser expectations. John Williams again provides the rousing score. A shame we see so little of the trilogy's real stars on this occasion. Of course I refer to R2D2 and C3PO.Saturday, May 3, 1997 - Knox District Centre",8,1,2,8 June 2008
Alien," Landmark Sci/fi suspense
","Ridley Scott's taught and visual direction makes this sci-fi/horror very suspenseful indeed. Simple plot tells the story of the commercial spaceship Nostromo, whose crew inadvertently allow an alien life form onto their craft, and then find themselves fighting for their lives. Certainly a well-scripted film, the performances from the seven-member cast add to this strength as they play their well-written characters spot on. Special effects and make-up are also very good.It is the skillful cinematography and direction that makes the film. Scott uses long panning camera shots to draw out the tension. A real landmark science-fiction/suspense movie.Friday, May 15, 1992 - VideoUltimate suspense is the only way to describe Ridley Scott's sci-fi masterpiece. This film, which is also part horror and part excruciating thriller, is superbly crafted by Scott whose use of the camera is nothing short of genius.Some eye-catching sets and nifty effects add to the 'doomed' feel. Sigourney Weaver is a knockout as the desperate yet practical Ripley, and the support does not let her down. Tom Skerritt is great as the ship's Captain Dallas, and Ian Holm is haunting as the cool science officer, Ashe. Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt and Veronica Cartwright are all dramatically strong too. Jerry Goldsmith penned the perfect score.Final word goes to original screenwriters Dan O'Bannen and Ronald Shusset, for creating the most original sci-fi tale ever.

The Doors," What an insight
","'The Doors' is just another piece in the bigger picture of the turbulent sixties which director Oliver Stone has so painstakingly created for us, along with 'Platoon', 'Born on the Fourth of July' and 'J.F.K.'. It has none of the power of its accompaniments, however it is an accurate depiction of the life and times of 'James Morrison.The cast are quite sensational and very convincing with Kilmer a stand out as the spaced out Morrison. The era and the music is recreated splendidly and one is given a real feel for what was a troubled time. Stone's movie is very honest, never trying to sway your emotions and always letting you come to your own conclusions.Never a sensational film (and not to my liking), but still one heck of an insight.Wednesday, October 28, 1992 - Video",5,0,4,19 October 2007
Taxi Driver," Dark, Violent and Depressing
","Considered by many to be one of Scorcese's finest, I found it hard to enjoy such a dark, violent and depressing film. Whether our director was trying to make a point is unclear, but if he was sending a message about the sickness in the streets of New York that is hate and violence, I don't know why he closed the film on an 'up'.DeNiro, as the 'Taxi Driver' in question, is frightening. He absorbs the role of the Vietnam vet who is pushed to his limit by the diseased city in which he lives. Then there's Jodie Foster, in the role of a child prostitute that showed much of the amazing talent that would floor us more than a decade later.For fans of any of the above movie legends this film should be viewed. I cannot recommend 'Taxi Driver' to any other audiences however. Also starred Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle.Sunday, November 7, 1999 - T.V.",5,0,3,4 May 2010
Over the Top," Stallone vehicle lacks content
","Not much to this film from director Menahem Golan. The story, from Gary Conway and David Engelbach, is about an arm wrestling trucker who is desperately trying to get to know his son whom he deserted years earlier.Released in 1987 (after four 'Rocky' movies), this one starred veteran actor Robert Loggia as Stallone's disapproving father-in-law and Susan Blakely as his estranged wife.Just another Sylvester Stallone muscle flexing vehicle.

Empire of the Sun," Obviously fails, though I am not sure why
","For all its professional craftsmanship, which has given this film a superb look, and all its fine acting, 'Empire of the Sun' is somehow unable to engross its viewer as perhaps it could have. Spielberg's failure here is obvious, the reason why is not so clear.This would be epic features cinematography that is both breath taking and awe inspiring. Director of Photography Allen Daviau captures some amazing images of the People's Republic of China, including some superb aerial action. Special effects, sound effects and stunts here are outstanding. Production design from Art Director Norman Reynolds is very handsome, and John Williams provides another strong score. Even the costumes and editing departments have done a commendable job.Add to all this a thoroughly convincing cast lead by newcomer Christian Bale, who creates a very believable character in the young, very English Jim Graham. Lending him support are John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and the ever enjoyable Nigel Havers, whose own turn is one of this film's best. So, given this movie's credentials, including some spectacular screen imagery and fantastic camera work, what on earth is wrong with it?Perhaps it's just that screenwriter Tom Stoppard was unable to involve us in the events of the war and the camps, no matter how he tried, leaving us feeling as if we're viewing it all from a distance. Character development may be another problem, as both Spielberg and the cast struggle to endear us to the pivotal players. Bale's character Jim is particularly hard to embrace, being a pompous, know-it-all, self-important English brat.In any event Spielberg has failed to do what he set out to do here. Though he has crafted a fine film, full of eye catching scenery and top notch craftsmanship, the entire show cannot truly move, involve or otherwise affect its audience. Therefore any message or point Mr. Spielberg wished to convey is lost in this crucial lack of depth. I am sure this missing element is in J.G. Ballard's book, so all I can suggest is that you read that instead. Surprisingly disappointing.Thursday, February 29, 1996 - Video",5,6,14,14 March 2008

","First saw this movie on March 18th, 1990, and it moved me, for obvious reasons. Screenwriter Kevin Jarre (from Robert Gould Shaw's letters and two novels) presents a well-told tale about the first black regiment of the Civil War in America.There are strong performances from Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman and Academy Award winner Denzel Washington. The cinematography is solid and the art direction splendid, but what makes the film is the moving soundtrack by James Horner. It not only makes the movie, it is a splendid work of art in its own right, with haunting choral anthems from the 'Boys Choir of Harlem'.

Rocky II," Go Rocky!!!
","Sylvester Stallone returns just three years on as writer, director and star in the second of this hugely popular series. John G. Avildsen does not return to direct, and perhaps this film has suffered as a result.This time 'Rocky' gets another chance at the title in this sequel that does not live up to its predecessor. It really misses that down and out feel of the first film. The slow middle does not help, however Burgess Meredith and a well-constructed climactic fight do. Still quite good entertainment. It was also great to see the rest of the original cast returning, including Talia Shire, Burt Young and Carl Weathers, as well as Bill Conti's rousing score.

Romeo + Juliet," Pure art and infinitely watchable
","Is Baz Luhrmann a master artist? Perhaps so. After his flamboyant, colourful and often riotous debut with 'Strictly Ballroom', which dazzled many audiences and captured the heart of Australian humour, many would have said yes. Now it seems that goes double after his latest creation, especially for this film lover.I must say 'Strictly Ballroom' did not exactly floor me when I saw it first, my expectations being higher than my appreciation. In hindsight though I can see what a clever stroke of originality it was. This time Luhrmann has boldly remade 'William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet', and again my expectations were high. Yet this time they were completely fulfilled.Mr. Luhrmann has fashioned an incredible piece of cinema, modernising the old bard's famous tragedy and proving that it is truly timeless. His flamboyance and flair again shows, and early on in the film our director almost over indulges with his little extravagances. Then again the opening scenes do rather set the mood for what is a fantastic eye-fest of colour and light as we are treated to superlative sets, incredible art direction and magnificent costumes form Kym Barrett. In fact it is ingenious that the poetry of the visual goes hand in hand with the original, virtually unaltered text. of the heart rending play.Renowned editor Jill Bilcock ('Evil Angels') does a marvellous job, as does cinematographer Donald McAlpine, brilliantly capturing some stunning, innovative shots of Luhrmann's gorgeous action. This is pure art, infinitely watchable.Finally there is the cast, who can make or break a movie in which acting is of paramount import. And they make it! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal Romeo, and his dramatic scenes are truly convincing and very strong, making us believe all his anguish and sorrow. Fabulous too is pretty Juliet, the thoroughly charming and captivating Claire Danes who has no trouble making us believe that she would surely die for her beloved Romeo. The support is tops too, with John Leguizamo especially sinister as Tybalt, Juliet's cousin and 'Prince of Cats'. Romeo's good friend Mercutio is played well by Harold Perrineau, with Jesse Bradford as Balthasar (Romeo's aide) and Paul Rudd as the dashing Paris who would woo Juliet if she would have him. Miriam Margoyles is most enjoyable as young Juliet's nurse-maid, as is Pete Postlethwaite as the priest who tries so desperately to help the star-crossed lovers. The heads of each household, played by Brian Dennehy and Christina Pickles (as the Montagues) and Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora (Capulets), have little to do, but they do impress in the few scenes they have.Please go and see this at the cinema.........................now!Wednesday, February 12, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaLuhrmann's elaborate, colourful, in your face interpretation of Shakespeare's timeless tragedy was bold to say the least. But it comes off! All the visual splendour loses a lot in the transition to the small screen, but as a piece of entertainment it is still quite a work.All technical credits, including cinematography, editing, set design and costumes, are outstanding, and the vibrant pop soundtrack adds aural colour. Acting is the film's strongest suit with DiCaprio and Danes leading the way, both giving emotionally strong showings. The support cast also deliver with special mention to John Leguizamo as the obsessive Tybalt and Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Lawrence.I strongly recommend a trip to the cinema for this or any Baz Luhrmann flick.Saturday, December 27, 1997 - Video",7,0,2,30 May 2008
Forrest Gump," Emotionally powerful journey is at times patchy and disjointed
","Comedy-fantasy director Robert Zemeckis ('Romancing the Stone', 'Back to the Future', 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and 'Death Becomes Her') branches out on a new tangent with the comedy-drama 'Forrest Gump', which tells the rather unlikely tale of a simple Alabama boy's incredible journey through life.At times Zemeckis manages some subtle and observant comedy, but at other times his attempts at humour fall completely flat. The same too can be said about the dramatic element of the film, with many emotionally powerful moments being contrasted with the bland and ineffective.Potentially, 'Forrest Gump' could have been a strong, intensely moving saga of the life of an extraordinary - though slightly 'stupid' - human being who's outlook on life could certainly teach us all a thing of two about what should really be important to us. Gump's naivety and basic values of friendship and love make him akin to another delightful yet simple character, Mickey Rooney's 'Bill', a mentally challenged man who's only care was the people close to him.Zemeckis does achieve inspiration occasionally -symbolism is interestingly used at the beginning and end of the picture, to represent Forrest's biggest responsibility coming into his life and then moving on in it's natural course - but for the most part he approaches the movie as a comedy and so wastes the opportunity to create some truly memorable cinema.Tom Hanks successfully tackles yet another challenging role, though hardly triumphantly. Though Forrest's life is a roller coaster of ups, downs and sensational events (too much so I must say), Hanks gets very little chance to display a versatile range of emotions, and he doesn't even have the most interesting character.As Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny, Robin Wright portrays with conviction a troubled, tormented and haunted character whose terrible childhood has left her with no self worth. Forrest is the only man who has ever respected and loved her for who she is. Also in strong support is a very impressive Gary Sinise as the bitter Lt. Dan Taylor, a man infuriated with Gump for saving his life, only to have to live it as a cripple. Trapped in a wheelchair and feeling cheated out of his destiny, the Lieutenant turns in desperation to booze and fast women.It is these two people, both of whom influence Forrest's life greatly, that are by far the most intriguing characters, and it's a shame their parts weren't developed more fully in this film. One mustn't forget the evergreen Sally Field either. She plays Gump's momma, and her small role gives us another glimpse of this fine actress.Cinematographer Don Burgess jumps at the chance to capture some marvellous images of war and peace, with rural America photographed splendidly at times. Rick Carter's production design maintains the authenticity from the sixties to the eighties, as does the rock soundtrack which even doubles as a narrator on occasion. Arthur Schmidt, as editor, had a tougher job though, and it would appear he had little idea what to leave in and what to take out.As a result Zemeckis' film is patchy and disjointed, inconsistent, episodic and a fraction over long. Our director and his script writer (Eric Roth-Groom) have tried too hard, and attempted to say too much. Perhaps they could learn something from Anthony Page's 'Bill' (1981), which was brilliant in its simplicity.Rest assured though that the promise shown in this movie indicates Bob Zemeckis has a definite future in the genre.Friday, December 2, 1994 - Croydon Twin Cinema",6,1,2,27 January 2008
Top Secret!," One of Z.A.Z.'s best
","One of this zany team's earlier works, and most definitely one of their best. 'Top Secret!' is a send up of all those old war/spy films. Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker manage to send up World War II, the Germans, the French and also make many references to other great films such as 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'The Great Escape'.Val Kilmer, Lucy Gutteridge, Jeremy Kemp and the supporting cast are loads of fun, but if 'stupid' comedy isn't your scene, please don't bother with this riotous movie.

Fargo," Coen Brothers Triumph Again
","The ingenious Coen brothers return triumphantly with this amazing tale of kidnapping gone horribly wrong. I say ingenious because the brothers Coen brought us that gangster masterpiece, 'Miller's Crossing'. And I say amazing simply due to the fact that the tale told in 'Fargo' is based upon actual events that took place in Minnesota.The brothers' odd way of looking at life is reflected in the screenplay from the pair and Joel's comic, slightly off-centre approach to what is essentially a horrifying story of a man's fatally destined plot to get together enough money to support a wild business venture. In the hands of the Coen brothers though it comes across almost like a satire, in which the audience will find themselves constantly laughing - when their mouths are not agape.Editor Roderick Jaynes has done a fine job keeping the story punchy and pepped up, Roger Deakins' cinematography is eye catching and contains some snow scenes you may not quickly forget and Carter Burwell's distinct score adds real flavour to proceedings, though it's not as good as his sweeping, poetic music from 'Miller's Crossing'. It is the cast that are the real strength here however.Frances McDormand gobbles up the lead role as Marge Gunderson, the local cop who seems to stumble on clue after clue to the disappearance of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) while always maintaining a most infectious demeanour. Even more impressive is William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the weak-kneed husband whose crazy plan backfires more than an old bus and whose silly smile and pathetic machinations dig him deeper and deeper into oblivion. Steve Buscemi is very enjoyable as the weaselly, 'funny lookin'' Carl who goes form Mr. Smooth to Mr. Insane as the deal goes from bad to worse to completely nuts. Finally, as Gaear, the menacing, quiet partner, Peter Stormare has us quite convinced he is one guy you wouldn't want to cross. Also stars Harve Presnell and John Carroll Lynch.Monday, February 17, 1997 - Hoyts CroydonThe genius of the brothers Coen shines again in this manipulative, surprising thriller/comedy/tragedy whose many shallow characters give it much depth.Brilliant perfs from McDormand and support bring to life this quirky collection of people, many of whom totally lose the plot when it comes to kidnapping and large amounts of the green. Cinematography in America's white-washed North is fantastic as is Carter Burwell's apt score.The Coen brothers may well be the screenplay kings of the 90's.Sunday, November 23, 1997 - Video",8,1,2,3 June 2008
Predator," Great action
","This John McTiernan film has an original plot, great action and tension. With Arnie sparing us the one-liners, it turns out to be an entertaining yarn about a small band of crack commandos up against God knows what in the Central American jungle.'Predator' also starred Carl Weathers of 'Rocky' fame (he played Apollo Creed). Director McTiernan delivers something of a different action film with this one, and I personally really enjoy these sort of departures.We never do find out what the Predator actually is, but perhaps the sequel will tell us. I hope so!Monday, February 18, 1991 - Video",7,1,2,3 February 2007
Léon: The Professional," Surprising action film
","Set in New York, Luc Besson's film tells the story of a young girl who attached herself to a hit man after her family is brutally murdered by a corrupt D.E.A. officer. On forcing her way into his apartment and convincing him to let her stay, Mathilda attempts to persuade Leon to help her exact revenge on the killers.Jean Reno is perfect as the terse yet mysterious 'Leon' of the title (also released as 'The Professional'), a master of his craft who features in much of the deadly, stimulating action. Gary Oldman is way over the top as the evil Stansfield, the bent, drugged out, highly charged cop who'll stop at nothing. Young Natalie Portman is most enjoyable as the world weary yet naive and impressionable Mathilda, and Danny Aiello lends support as crime boss Tony ('...nobody steals from old Tony').Luc Besson directs with purpose and manages to create real suspense and tension, while supplying his viewers with enjoyable characters that are infinitely more likable than those in his flawed French thriller 'La Femme Nikita'. 'The Professional' is never inspirational nor groundbreaking, but it is definitely entertaining.The movie's main and most obvious theme is revenge, yet while this remains the driving force of the narrative, Besson does not allow proceedings to become too one-directional as he offers up other topics of interest such as people's need to be needed and a child's need for a sturdy father figure.A surprising, not so predictable conclusion also helps this pic's cause immensely.Friday, March 10, 1995 - Quality Hotel Maingate, Anaheim",7,0,1,7 February 2008
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," The Robin Williams show
","Robin Williams is Adrian Cronauer! That is not only the basic gist of this movie it is what 'Good Morning, Vietnam' relies upon entirely.This is indeed a manic, and quite funny, performance from Williams, who seems born to do this outrageous style of humour. The rest of the film is just background as we are treated to almost two hours of what many would call Mr. Williams ingenious ad-libbing.'Good Morning, Vietnam' is very funny on first viewing, but fails to deliver the laughs a second time around.

Grease," What a drag
","This huge hit from 1978 is a rather silly, occasionally funny comedy-musical about high school life and love in the fifties. Randall Kleiser's film has enjoyed several revivals and still holds a baffling cult status today.The acting from John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing and support is painful, even if the dancing is, along with the music, quite good. The disco soundtrack featured some huge hits and may have been this movie's saving grace.Watching 'Grease' for a painful third time, I almost walked out. I could not wait for it to finish. Musicals just aren't my thing.Monday, June 10, 1991 - Golden Twin Cinema, Bendigo",3,4,10,29 May 2007
Footloose," Not a lot to rave about
","Contrived teen film from the mid-80's which was fairly obviously aimed at the rebellious nature of so many of today's young people. Kevin Bacon is the new kid in town, a tough, smart so 'n' so who doesn't take to the country town laws which say he can't play rock music or dance. But he decides he'll show 'em what they're missing.'Footloose' is backed up by a nifty soundtrack, and some fair humour, yet everything else is left wanting. Most of the characters are very two dimensional, and John Lithgow's immense talent is wasted on his poorly developed, 'typical minister' role. Also starred Lori Singer and Chris Penn. Not a lot to rave about.Saturday, November 13, 1993 - Video",4,1,6,5 December 2007
Armageddon," Oh no, it's Armageddon!!
","Oh no, here comes a big rock headed straight towards earth. Oh no, it's the end of the world. Oh, it's only a movie! Don't worry, Bruce Willis, the best oil driller in the world, will save us.Shallow it may be, but Michael Bay does all the right things with his move 'Armageddon'. Lots of stuff blows up, the situation becomes critical, and the heroes come to the rescue just in time.Bruce Willis pulls all the right faces, while Ben Affleck provides the film with its young hero. Both the special visual effects and the sound are awesome, of course. Also stars Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi.Saturday, June 12,1999 - Video",6,1,2,23 April 2010
North by Northwest," Ordinary Man - Extraordinary Situation - Classic Hitchcock
","'North by Northwest' is classic 50's Hitchcock straight down the line. An ordinary man in an extraordinary situation; the female character who is not all we think she is; even the 'McGuff' turns up eventually.The film, from writer Ernst Lehman, follows the lean Cary Grant from one exciting tight spot to the next as he desperately tries to convince a bunch of would-be assassins that he is not a government agent. Grant is ideal for this average-joe role and he pulls it off well, almost having too much fun. Only Jimmy Stewart could do it better. Eva Marie Saint is reasonable as the femme fatale in question, while James Mason makes for a delicious villain. A young Martin Landau lends malevolent support as one of Mason's henchman.Photographer Robert Burks goes to town with several scenes, especially the brilliant Indiana bus stop showdown. And Mt. Rushmore is perfect for Art Directors Robert Boyle and William A. Horning to display their talents.For purist Hitchcock fans, this is one of his best. The music from Hitchcock regular Bernard Hermann is dramatic.Sunday, October 3, 1998 - Astor Theatre",7,2,5,3 March 2010
The Shining," Destruction of King's chiller
","Director and co-writer Stanley Kubrick (with Diane Johnson) has single-handedly destroyed what is reputed to be one of Stephen King's most chilling tales.The story of a little boy who has extra-sensory perception is totally mangled by Kubrick. Not only has he turned this into some sort of blood-fest, but somehow he has managed to make 'The Shining' completely unfathomable.Big Jack tries hard, yet even he can't save what Mad Magazine once aptly described as 'The Shiner'. All Shelley Duvall can do is look pale and panicked, while Danny Lloyd (as the supernaturally gifted Danny) just talks to his little finger a lot.At least there's a grand hotel set and some pretty snow to look at.

American Beauty," Highly Touted Offering
","So! What's all the fuss about? I was very disappointed with this highly touted offering from director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball.To be fair, the film does focus well on some of our worst human frailties, and a few scenes are disturbingly close to home. Having said this, I find it hard to call the disintegration of the family unit entertainment, let alone black comedy.I am a huge Kevin Spacey fan, yet I could not take to him in this film. Either the role and he were mismatched, or he is only at his best in support roles. Annette Bening is at her marvellous best as the obsessive Carolyn, and Thora Birch is a major talent on the threshold as the frustrated teenager Jane. Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallagher, Sam Robards and Scott Bakula also star. Thomas Newman produces a familiar theme.What a shame this film lost the plot so badly after a promising, thematic beginning.Friday, January 28, 2000 - Village Century City Walk",3,1,3,30 May 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best ever sequels
","James Cameron has stuck to his theory that a sequel should be different in order to be better than the original, and has produced a knock your sox off film in the process.The special effects are the main attraction here, and they are fantastic! The plot is good, if a little disappointing due to the moral content (they had to have a message didn't they)! The fact that Arnie is the good guy does not help. I liked him a lot better as the 'take no crap', unstoppable Terminator. However, Robert Patrick is quite good as the evil new Terminator model, the 'T-1000'. As young John Connor, Edward Furlong makes an impressive debut.Brad Fiedel's music is still extremely effective, and what with two fantastically choreographed chase sequences along with an eye-popping climax, this is a must see movie. Spectacular!Thursday, September 5, 1991 - Knox District Centre'T-2' does not hold as well second time. Action sequences are still fantastic and performances good, but the movie is almost showing off with special f/x, although they are quite enjoyable.Unfortunately I still can't swallow the 'nice' story or Arnie as a good guy.Saturday, September 21, 1991 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase'Terminator II' is still fabulously entertaining third time around. Action sequences are probably the best ever constructed for the cinema.The scene in the Galleria (Arnie first meets T-One Thousand) is a heart pounding, edge of the seat thriller.

Apocalypse Now," The Insanity of the Vietnam War
","Francis Ford Coppola presented the world in 1979 a war epic about the insanity of Vietnam by telling us the story of much decorated Colonel Kurtz who, having lost his mind, had taken command of a motley crew of soldiers and natives and lead them across the border into Cambodia, leaving a trail of death and destruction behind him. Lieutenant Willard is assigned the unenviable mission of sailing up river through treacherous 'Charlie' territory in order to locate Kurtz and terminate him.Willard (Martin Sheen) takes us on a powerful tour of what was a crazy war, as he comes across more and more frightening people and situations the further he journeys, until finally confronting the ultimate madman.Coppola's film, the first of it's kind to deal with Vietnam, is forceful and unrelenting in the extreme, and very much not for the faint hearted. Martin Sheen gives a very strong performance as the lieutenant whose own sanity is on a knife edge and whose heart may have already turned to darkness, while Marlon Brando delivers a typically memorable turn of commendable weight as the twisted Colonel. All other support players are impressive too, with Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall and Larry Fishburne all striking in the memory. The technical crew weren't ignored at the Oscars, with cinematography and sound taking out that year's awards, along with a best supporting actor Oscar for Duvall.Certainly 'Apocalypse Now' achieves its objective, that is to show the true heart of an insane war and to disturb its audience in the process, though it probably never went a long way toward an in-depth and understanding overview. Rest assured however that Francis Coppola will never be forgotten for what is an astounding and shocking movie. I shouldn't neglect to mention that some of the cinematography is truly awesome, and is best appreciated at the movies.Sunday, July 10, 1994 - Video",7,1,2,11 January 2008
Rocky IV," Forget it!
","The 'Rocky' formula is definitely getting tired in this fourth installment of the boxing franchise that swept the world. Talia Shire, Carl Weathers and Burt Young return, but to no avail. Even newcomers Dolph Lundgren and Brigitte Nielsen cannot get us interested in the predictable storyline.Sylvester Stallone writes and directs a film that unabashedly uses East versus West in an evil versus good vein. It is pathetic, and only sickeningly patriotic westerners would have fallen for it. The action is better in previous Rocky movies, and I am sick to death of Paulie. This film really needed Burgess Meredith. Forget it!Friday, February 15, 1991 - Video",4,0,3,2 February 2007
In the Name of the Father," Will stir your soul and disturb you
","In 1974 a London pub in the town of Guildford was hit by I.R.A. activists with a terrorists bomb, and no warning was given. Five people were killed and several others maimed and injured in a tragedy which sent shock waves through a then terrified and outraged public who demanded police bring the culprits to justice.Director and co-writer Jim Sheridan (scripting with Terry George) brings us the story of a group of young people from Ireland who were brought forward by police to face the charges of murder that related to the bombing. They were unceremoniously tried and found guilty, then sentenced to between fifteen years and life. Pleading their innocence to an unsympathetic jury and public had got them nowhere, so they were left to fight for their freedom from the inside.As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance too as lawyer Gareth Peirce, the woman who has taken up the appeal. All other cast members are impressive.Sheridan presents a highly charged, emotional drama which tells a horrifying tale in what is a black period in Irish and English history that continues even today. While he perhaps could have shown us more of the people's reaction and the feeling of the time, he instead concentrates on the Conlon's plight and their never ending fight for justice. Due credit must also go to Jim Sheridan for keeping what would have to be an incident and an issue that is close to his heart, very evenly balanced, as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty of terrible and unspeakable acts.Backed up by some very good cinematography, editing and set direction, 'In the Name of the Father' is certainly a movie that will stir your soul and disturb you. It is truly frightening what men in power are capable of, and even more frightening are the devastating effects they can have on so many people's lives.Saturday, June 18, 1994 - Greater Union MelbourneDirector Jim Sheridan's account of one of the most ruthless bombings undertaken by the IRA is jam-packed with emotion. The tragic, moving story of how the 'Guildford Four' lost their freedom, and fifteen years of their lives, for something they were never a part of makes for a most upsetting and aggravating film.The powerhouse performances from leads Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite are sensational, as is Emma Thompson's showing as compassionate lawyer Gareth Pierce.Not seeing this film would almost be as grave an injustice as was that which befell these innocent people.Monday, June 12, 1995 - Video",8,4,5,7 January 2008
Dark City," Enjoyable Science-Fiction Outing
","Science-fiction done well is always enjoyable. Such is the case with Alex Proyas' 'Dark City'. The writer, co-scripter and director, Proyas has given his film a real boost by adding strong dramatic tension and a menacing thriller element. He blends all the ingredients well, and provides the perfect mood for the feature.George Liddle's production design is superlative, well captured as it is by the camera of Dariusz Wolski. Music is from Trevor Jones.Rufus Sewell does very well as the bewildered Murdoch, a man who has no idea who he is or what is going on in this 'Dark City'. Kiefer Sutherland is a treat (perhaps his best role) as the psychiatrist who appears to hold the key to Murdoch's past and the secrets of the city. William Hurt sadly gets too little to do as the fastidious Inspector Bumstead, while Colin Friels plays the borderline psychotic 'Frank' with glee. Also starts Jennifer Connelly as Murdoch's forgotten wife, and Aussie stars Melissa George and Bruce Spence. Great to see!The only thing Mr. Proyas does not prepare us for is his rather over the top finale (perhaps a little overkill there), and his all too neat denouement. The conclusion only slightly taints what is otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable production.Friday, October 30, 1998 - Astor Theatre StKilda",7,0,2,7 March 2010
Aliens," Taught, relentless
","James Cameron, the action director of the 80's (and now the 90's), has done it again with this sequel to the very suspenseful 1979 film. Its action sequences are unparalleled (apart from 'The Terminator' films) all being, as per vintage Cameron, excellently choreographed.This new directors cut does give depth to the characters of 'Ripley'(Sigourney Weaver) and 'Newt'(Carrie Henn), but it makes the film too long. All the added footage is unnecessary, as 'Aliens' is essentially an action film, and it is in this mode that it works best. For mine, stick with the original version.The whole cast is very convincing, the special effects (especially 'Alien' effects) are top notch and James Horner's music works very well. A taught, relentless actioner that never lets up once it finds top gear. Great stuff.NB This is the special re-edited version from James Cameron, running at 154 minutes rather than 137 minutes.Sunday, June 7, 1992 - VideoCameron's fantastic actioner is marred only by over-length. The special edition, with an extra seventeen minutes of unnecessary footage, only makes things worse. 'Aliens' is for too long at 154 minutes.Still, when it is at full throttle, it is a great action film. Don't see it too often though. Or do some serious editing of your own if you do.Tuesday, September 29, 1992 - VideoFrom ultimate suspense to ultimate action. The very astute James Cameron saw a great actioner in this sequel to Scott's '79 suspenser. In his wisdom, he made a very different film.'Aliens' is a romp that sees Ripley become one of the greatest big screen heroes ever. Sigourney Weaver is tops again, and is backed up by a bad cast of marines including Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn and Jeanette Goldstein. Paul Reiser and Carrie Henn also star. James Horner provides a top military score. Sound and visual effects are awesome.Top marks to Cameron and producer Gale Ann Hurd for bringing us some of the best action sequences ever.

Gandhi," Most Important Drama
","For the sheer impact that the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi had on the world, Sir Richard Attenborough's 'Gandhi' must be one of the most important dramas ever made.From the ground up this is both a labour of love and a technical masterpiece. Billy Williams and Ronnie Taylor's majestic photography captures mother India with aplomb, costumes from the period are near faultless, art director Stuart Craig recreates scene after scene unerringly, and John Bloom's editing leaves the final cut with a perfect weight, balance and momentum. All of the afore mentioned won Academy Awards, whilst sound, makeup and music (Ravi Shankar, and an original score from George Fenton) received nominations.'Gandhi' owes its excellence and extreme effectiveness to three things however. Sir Richard Attenborough directs with purpose, and I have already stated : this was obviously a labour of love. He has succeeded at what he set out to do, that is to show us the heart of the man who freed India from English rule (and from each other for a time) through a sheer act of will. Yet how could Sir Dickie miss. John Briley's screenplay was perhaps one of the best ever written directly for the screen. Truly he encapsulates everything that the Mahatma was, and everything he stood for. After viewing 'Gandhi', one feels that one knew the man personally, thanks to Mr. Briley's script, whose depth is pervasive throughout.The cast are the final jewel in this brilliant crown. Very strong indeed are Edward Fox, as the apparently soul-less General Dyer, Roshan Seth as Gandhi's good friend Nehru - who becomes first Prime Minister of India - and Rohini Hattangady, especially memorable as devout wife, Mrs. Gandhi. Good performances come also from Geraldine James as adopted daughter/disciple Marabehn, Candice Bergen as Time photographer Margaret Bourke-White, Martin Sheen as New York Times reporter Walker, and Athol Fugard as General Smuts. Ian Charleson, Sir John Gielgud, Sir John Mills, Trevor Howard and Amrish Peru also star. All these players pale though in the light of one of the most complete characterisations ever to grace the screen. Ben Kingsley creates an amazing Gandhi. Both physically and actually, he brings the spiritual leader to life as no one could have believed possible. Kingsley portrays his compassion, stubbornness, boldness and true love for fellow man with a compelling turn. So good is his personification that he has even managed to adjust the little man's accent perfectly, taking it from the English influence of his education to the Indian of his latter days. Kingsley's Oscar for this outstanding showing was more than deserved. 'Gandhi' also won for best picture and best director.An inspirational and immeasurably moving insight into the life of a man who knew so much about the truth. The Mahatma lived his life as Christ taught us to live. Gandhi showed compassion for the oppressed, yet would not raise a hand against his oppressors. His peaceful non-cooperation was both brave and the only true answer. Meeting violence with violence only breeds the same, and is never a solution. Mohandas K. Gandhi truly lived the scriptures: turn the other cheek and love thy neighbour as thyself.Thursday, June 12, 1997 - VideoThere are not enough superlatives to describe the high level of excellence in Sir Richard Attenborough's film 'Gandhi', nor are there enough adjectives with which to outline its importance.Production values, from Stuart Craig's art, to John Bloom's editing, to Billy Williams and Ronnie Taylor's cinematography, all are superb. Ravi Shanker and George Fenton provide some ideal music, John Briley the perfect script, and Sir Richard controls proceedings with skill and purpose. Yet the most moving and effective contribution comes from the cast.Actors such a Rohini Hattangady (Mrs. Gandhi), Roshan Seth (Neru), Geraldine James (Mirabehn), Candice Bergen (Margaret Bourke-White), Martin Sheen (Walker), Edward Fox (General Dyer), Athol Fugard, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Amrish Peru and Ian Charleson all make you believe you are witnessing history unfold. Cap this with perhaps the best performance by an actor in our generation (that of the brilliant Ben Kingsley) and you have a film that no responsible person should miss.So good was this rendering of the Mahatma's story, that no-one has tackled the topic since. No-one has needed to.Saturday, June 13, 1998 - Video",9,0,1,27 June 2008
American History X," Important Film
","Important films like 'American History X' don't come along every day. When they do, and they are as good as this one, they leave a marked impact. The message here is sure, purposeful and delivered with power. The destructive nature of hate is laid bare by the positive direction and raw script presented in this powerful movie. The fruit of hatred is pain, suffering and great loss. Contrary to this, love leads to hope, joy and fulfillment.Edward Norton is as good as you have heard. He is fantastic in all facets of this complex role, and his performance is no less than a tour-de-force. Edward Furlong has come of age too, with his portrayal of the little brother who idolises everything his big brother has become. The story, about Neo-Nazis and their reign of terror in Los Angeles, is a fictional dramatisation of what is a very real problem. The film's violence and intensity may be too much for sensitive viewers; however I highly recommend this film to all conscientious film goers.Saturday, May 8, 1999 - Village Centre Melbourne",8,0,2,18 April 2010
The Usual Suspects," Will have you thinking, and talking, for some time
","If you're after a movie that makes you think, then 'The Usual Suspects' is for you. The clever, slick plot from Christopher McQuarrie is full of double-cross and twists, but is occasionally difficult to keep up with and perhaps the film could have been a little longer.Director Brian Singer has opted for a fast paced narrative rather than drawing out the conclusion. 'Pulp Fiction' was criticised for being over long, as are many gangster-thrillers, so Singer and his editor are determined not to let 'The Usual Suspects' get away from them. I for one though feel that sometimes more is more, and that maybe another half an hour could have added some clarity, depth and extra intrigue. Sometimes one gets the feeling that a few pieces of the puzzle are missing, perhaps due to over editing. Not that any of this takes away from the entertainment value of this pic, but wouldn't this have made a great series in the 'Twin Peaks' vain (not 'Who killed Laura Palmer?' but 'Who is Kaiser Soze?').The cast is headed up by Chazz Palminteri who is good as the inspector questioning the timid but sly 'Verbal', a strong showing by Kevin Spacey. Commendable support comes from Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Suzanne Amis, Giancarlo Esposito, Dan Hedaya and Pete Postlethwaite. Gabriel Byrne makes a marked impression as Keaton, an ex-cop turned corrupt.McQuarrie's story, which is really too clever to be told in under two hours, contains plenty of intrigue as it tells of five criminals who are mysteriously brought together by an unseen crime boss who forces the motley crew to participate in a suicidal raid because they owe him. All the characters are fantastic, but we really don't get time to absorb them fully. Comedy is prevalent early on, but is found wanting as the film heads towards its conclusion. The finale itself is a complete surprise, with almost what one could classify as two endings. It's possible Singer and McQuarrie couldn't decide which was the better resolution, so they offered us both. This, I might add, is too the audience's benefit. Over all a thoroughly enjoyable piece of entertainment that will have you thinking, and keep you talking, long after you leave the cinema.Saturday, January 13, 1996 - Astor TheatreThe title of this film hardly prepares you for what you're about to experience. There is nothing usual about 'The Usual Suspects'.Bryan Singer's film of Christopher McQuarrie's story is intricately interwoven and ingeniously, teasingly presented. Even seeing this flick a second time is most rewarding. We may know the answer to the mystery, but we are able to put it all together from the beginning and perhaps appreciate much more the subtleties of the plot.The whole attraction of the film is the tale itself, as it is told from the eyes of 'Verbal', the crippled, petty thief who is caught up in a criminal subterfuge that seems beyond fathoming. Performances from the whole cast are assured, with Kevin Spacey most impressive as the nervous 'Verbal', and others such as Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack and Stephen Baldwin giving impressive turns. Music from John Ottman is right on the money, being compelling and mysterious.I still say this pic would have made a great t.v. series : 'Who is Kaiser Soze?'.Sunday, April 20, 1997 - Video",8,0,2,7 March 2008
Die Hard 2," McClane is at it again
","'Look who's back in the wrong place at the right time.' Yes, it's another Christmas and another band of terrorists for our hero 'John McClane' to cope with, this time at Dallas International Airport, Washington D.C.Renny Harlin presents us with a sequel so true to the original that it's almost clichéd. Only on this occasion, the action is the one thing which holds this film together. McClane has become, almost inevitably, near invincible as 'Die Hard 2' fails to present what the first film did, a human hero. The terrorists also lack depth, something that the previous movie benefited so much from.Unlikely, but still fun, though nowhere near as funny.Thursday, September 24, 1992 - Video",5,8,13,14 October 2007
Flashdance," Likable dance movie
","Enjoyable drama that helped kick start a new dance craze in the early 80's, 'Flashdance' follows the fortunes of welder/night club dancer Alex as she dreams of one day turning professional.While the main attraction is probably the very popular soundtrack (main theme by Irene Cara), the narrative remains interesting throughout, and Adrian Lyne creates believable characters which form the basis of the strong plot.The ending may be a little predictable, and perhaps unlikely, but it won't spoil what is quite a likable movie from a director who of course went on to some really riveting drama four years later.Sunday, November 14, 1993 - Video",6,4,8,6 December 2007
Dirty Dancing," Hunky Swayze makes something out of nothing
","The movie 'Grease' would probably have to be held responsible for the spate of teenage 'musicals' which brought us the likes of 'Flashdance', 'Footloose' and then this over rated box office smash. Funny thing is, 'Dirty Dancing' has little dancing in it, and even less dirt.The main gist of the story concerns a young girl who does a lot of growing up during a summer holiday with her family when she meets and falls in love with a rebellious young dancer. This melodramatic show covers quite a few controversial topics, but director Emile Ardolino shuns them in preference to a more appealing, superficial style.'Dirty Dancing' was made to please hoards of teenage movie-goers, and it did thanks to Swayze's hunky looks and a very good pop soundtrack. Otherwise this movie fails to deliver solid entertainment in any way. Just as I expected.Tuesday, March 1, 1994 - T.V.",4,0,5,27 December 2007
Independence Day," Unimaginative, one-dimensional and visually awesome
","In reality, it's often comforting to know that all your expectations will be met and that no surprises are in store. At the movies however the unexpected is almost always a welcome visitor. But with the highly touted 'Independance Day', the unexpected was never going to make an appearance.On viewing this phenomenal blockbuster, I was greeted with exactly what I expected : complete schmaltz with an unimaginative storyline, one dimensional characters and a sight and sound show that sends you reeling.Roland Emmerich ('Universal Soldier') and partner in crime/producer Dean Devlin have ground out a terribly manufactured, formulated script that is both derivative and dull, but who cares. The characters are all stereotyped and one can hardly begin to care whether or not they are blown up by spaceships, but who cares. What really matters is that 'ID4' has delivered exactly what it promised, a visual display of mind blowing proportion, and an awesome sound effects show to back it up. The alien invasion is incredibly convincing thanks to the work of the f/x crew, with the definite highlight being the explosive destruction of several major cities. All this amazing cinematic genius adds up to pure escapism for the viewer.Never mind that poor old Bill Pullman gets the worst role of his life as the young American president who is forced to deliver some of the most awful lines ever written for a lead player. Nobody else fairs any better, with Will Smith as the all American hero pilot who sees all of his dreams come true as he becomes a pseudo-astronaut and gets to save the world at the same time. And as the mathematical whiz who comes up with the ultimate plan to overthrow the enemy, Jeff Goldblum could be in danger of becoming stereotyped, though at least he had a little more to work with than most. Also starred Judd Hirsch, Mary McDonnell, Margaret Colin, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Harvey Fierstein, Harry Connick Jnr., and Brent Spiner.Although more than two hours in length, 'Independance Day' never seems to over stay its welcome, but I wouldn't recommend more than one viewing. If you do decide to catch this f/x extravaganza, do so at the cinema, preferably one equipped with a THX or Digital stereo sound system. A knockout for sure, but never a lasting memory.Sunday, October 13, 1996 - Knox District Centre",6,1,2,31 March 2008
Gone with the Wind," Perennial, timeless classic
","Perennial, timeless classic and perhaps the most beloved movie of all time is Victor Fleming's 1939 best picture 'Gone With the Wind'. An epic in every sense of the word, and one that must be viewed with a big audience at the cinema.Margaret Mitchell's novel, much celebrated in its day, about the Grand Old South at the time of the civil war, is lovingly and lavishly brought to the screen by David O. Selznick, the producer, and a cast of thousands. Vivien Leigh plays the headstrong, manipulative Katie Scarlett O'Hara very well, an attractive young Southern belle who appears to have literally dozens of beaux chasing her hand, as all the while she pines for the one love of her heart that she can't have, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). Clark Gable plays the dashing Rhett Butler, a womaniser who says he's not the marrying kind, but is completely taken by the determined young Scarlett. The rest of the cast are very enjoyable also, especially Hattie McDaniel who puts in a wonderful performance as the O'Hara's old mammy, an hilarious turn that is truly superb.Production values are splendid too, with art/set decoration and cinematography being particularly spectacular, and Max Steiner's music nothing short of grandiose.Definitely not for the restless or impatient at over three and a half hours, but certainly a must for anybody who calls themselves a movie buff or anyone who loves a sweeping saga of war and romance.Sunday, August 14, 1994 - Astor TheatreBest Picture for 1939, 'Gone With the Wind' absolutely defines the word epic, and doesn't do a bad job at defining melodramatic either, or sweeping saga or whatever you like.Clark Gable is positively charming as the dashing Rhett Butler, Vivien Leigh is a true diva, stunningly beautiful and incidentally not a half bad actress. In strong support of these two shining stars are Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland, as the sop Ashley Wilkes and the pure-hearted Melanie. Simply outstanding in her Oscar winning role is the O'Hara's shrewd old mammy, played delightfully by Hattie McDaniel.The superlative technical team have provided some wonderful, extravagant costumes, incredibly convincing sets (Art Directors Lyle Wheeler and William Cameron Menzies) and amazing -for 1939 - special effects. The Atlanta fire is especially impressive.Director Victor Fleming supplies fine direction throughout, though it is widely accepted that many others helped out (perhaps including producer David O. Selznick). Sidney Howard's screenplay adaptation does justice to Margaret Mitchell's enormous tale of the 'Grand Ole South', making for splendid story telling, though you may want to tackle it in two or three sittings. Max Steiner's music is grandiose, as is the cinematography from Ernest Haller, Ray Rennaham and Wilfrid M. Cline.Saturday, October 7, 1995 - Video",7,3,6,17 January 2008
Legends of the Fall," Melodramatic, uninspiring and never legendary
","Director Ed Zwick attempts to achieve what he did so splendidly with the civil war in 'Glory' with a totally different genre in 'Legends of the Fall', that of family drama. 'Glory' depicted the first African-American regiments' trials and triumphs in epic fashion, yet 'Legends' depicts the trials and triumphs of the Ludlow boys with little affect. Unfortunately Mr. Zwick has tried to turn small scale into large scale with not nearly enough material. The result is a melodrama that's way too soapy (much too much happens to this clan), totally uninspiring and pointless, and never legendary.'Legends of the Fall' is episodic without creating any fascination for the viewer. In fact it is often dreary and suffers greatly from over length. Although the narrative is occasionally moving, it rarely threatens to get interesting and is too often implausible.As the three brothers, Aidan Quinn, Brad Pitt (ever the hunk) and Henry Thomas all give solid performances, as does the pretty love interest, Julia Ormond. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the entire film is Sir Anthony Hopkins below par showing as the father William Ludlow.One highlight is John Toll's grandiose cinematography, whilst James Horner scores again for director Zwick.Friday, March 10, 1995 - Mainplace Mall, Anaheim",3,7,13,7 February 2008
Days of Thunder," Stock Standard Speedway Show
","This Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer production about stock car racing is pretty much stock. 'Days of Thunder' has some good action sequences if you like your cars fast and furious, yet it ends up like a one hundred and four minute add for NASCAR! The script from Robert Towne is weak (a 'Top Gun' for racing cars - the original story was co-written by Robert Towne and Tom Cruise), and even Nicole Kidman seems disinterested, although Robert Duvall always makes the most of anything. Also starred Cary Elwes and Randy Quaid.Well know action director Tony Scott produces flashes of entertainment, but cannot make this film more than forgettable at best.Sunday, May 26, 1991 - Video",5,1,3,28 May 2007
Liar Liar," Likable Carrey
","For someone who does not normally enjoy the bizarre antics of in-your-face comedian Jim Carrey, I rather liked this amiable light fare about habitual liar Fletcher Reade, a man whose career is set way above fatherhood on his priority list.Carrey performs some amazing physical slapstick, and he makes the ridiculous look humorous quite often. His persona, however, is still difficult to adjust to.When in comic mode, 'Liar Liar' works well, and the support play off the leading man admirably. Especially likable is Fletcher's feisty secretary, played by the wonderful Anne Haney.The film does err in focusing on drama at times, and this is when the movie's soft under-belly is exposed. Still, it's the best Carrey film I have seen to date.Sunday, April 19, 1998 - Video",5,0,2,29 August 2008
The Princess Bride," Fairytale Love Story
","Infinitely likable tale about a fairytale love story concerning a lonely princess and her dashing hero. This unusual film is refreshingly different, being at once funny, exciting and moving. A large amount of the credit must go to William Goldman's screenplay, adapted from his own novel; and director Rob Reiner's ability to pull it all together in just the right way.Mark Knopfler's simple theme music, Norman Garwood's production design and Adrain Biddle's cinematography all compliment proceedings.The cast round things off, with Robin Wright making her debut alongside the debonair Cary Elwes. Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest and Wallace Shawn are all suitably malevolent while Andre the Giant has a ball. Peter Falk, Billy Crystal and Carol Kane all drop by, while Mandy Patinkin is great as master Spanish swordsman Inigo Montoya.Wednesday, April 26, 2000 - Video",7,1,2,3 August 2010
Saving Private Ryan," Powerfully Numbing
","'Saving Private Ryan' is everything you expect it to be and more. I left the cinema totally numb after this experience, not knowing how I really felt about the movie. All I was thinking was why? Do we really need a another movie about the atrocities of war? Perhaps I just don't want to know the truth or see the reality of this horror that mankind seems determined to continually perpetuate. The heart of man is evil continually. Even more frightening than this is the fact that the powers of the world who have set their minds to war and murder to maintain control would not even think twice after viewing this film.For Spielberg this film was evidently a lot more than just a revelation of World War II. This was a message from son to father, a call for approval from a boy to his dad. The fact that Arnold Spielberg was overcome with emotion may indicate that his boy did good this time. Steven is as masterfully in control of this film as he was with 'Schindler's List'. I still feel the earlier film is his dramatic best, yet it is difficult to fault 'Private Ryan' in its execution. It is only its concept that I am still battling with.Tom Hanks plays yet another all American, this time the captain who is ordered to take a small band of men to find Ryan. His performance was strong, yet I was not truly blown away as I expected to be. Perhaps I have come to expect too much of the great Mr. Hanks. The support cast are also intense, and include Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg and Barry Pepper. Special mention goes to Tom Sizemore as Sargeant Horvath, Jeremy Davies as the timid Corporal Upham and Matt Damon, credible as the last of the Ryan brothers. Ted Danson and Dennis Farina drop in as senior officers.Spielberg has again teamed with 'Schindler's' cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and the results are astounding. The opening sequence is particularly breathtaking. John Williams is of course the only choice for original score. In this impacting picture, I barely noticed his composition. That probably indicates how good it was. Art direction and set decoration are both awesome.The enormity of the film cannot be denied, neither I suppose can its importance. With all my reservations, it is one of the first - if not the first - movies not to gloss over World War II. It is for this reason I must recommend all those who can handle it go and see it; and it is also why I find it so hard to mark this film down.Sunday, December 13, 1998 - Bairnsdale CinemasThere are two ways to look at 'Saving Private Ryan'. Technicallly and philosophically. Let me address both briefly.Technically the film has few faults. Certainly, cinematography, sound effects and sets are all astounding. You cannot be anything but blown away by the opening sequence. Spielberg shows again he is a master craftsman, able to bring any vision from within his imagination to the silver screen. He takes this simple story of an unusual rescue mission in the middle of World War II, and turns it into an unforgettable movie experience. Tom Hanks is amazing as Captain Miller, playing with perfect understatement the weary commanding officer who must lead his band of eight men in search of Private Ryan. In impressive support is Tom Sizemore, fantastic as the tough sarge who backs Miller all the way. An excellent support cast back these two compellingly.Philosophically, I have argued before that this film was brilliant yet unnecessary; that we have seen enough graphic anti-war films and that this was one too many. On second viewing, it is very hard to keep this argument up. Even if we have seen a dozen films such as this, 'Saving Private Ryan' is still a very important film. Why? It shows us the horror that war is. The waste, the destruction and the total futility of the whole thing. Why do we keep destroying each other like this? What is wrong with us? I still argue that 'Schindler's List' was a more important film, and perhaps a better one. This film rates right up there though.Saturday, January 8, 2000 - Video",8,1,3,23 March 2010
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Entertaining and unbelievable
","As entertaining, and as unbelievable, as the first is Spielberg's return to rampant, DNA induced Dino's, 'The Lost World'.I guess a sequel was inevitable, as is the final twenty minutes of this film. Surprises are supplied in the script, yet most of the action sequences lack imagination. Only the very early scenes impress, the initial encounters being at times thrilling, especially the scene in which the T-Rex's shove twin trailers over a cliff.Special effects again take the limelight, but we've seen it all before, so the affect is diminished. John Williams score makes a welcome return, and his aural composition is supported by great cinematography.Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) returns from 'Jurassic Park', and is now the hero of the moment. Goldblum plays well the mathematician who is decidedly unenthusiastic about being among the deadly dinosaurs. Much more keen is his new g.f., played by the likable Julianne Moore. She is the palaeontologist who volunteers to observe the dinosaurs in their natural habitat and make recordings for entrepreneur Sir Richard Attenborough. Vince Vaughn forms part of this passive group. Heading up an opposing, aggressive band who plan to capture and export the beasts is Pete Postlethwaite, portraying most enjoyably the great white hunter who longs to stalk a male T-Rex.Leave it to Spielberg to recreate the excitement, drama and thrills of the first film. A shame about the closing thirty minutes though.Sunday, July 13, 1997 - Knox District Centre",7,43,53,28 June 2008
JFK," Riveting reality, tragic event
","One must envy Oliver Stone, who was able here to work with probably the best non-fictional material ever to come to the screen. In the shocking assassination of President John F. Kennedy, he has a riveting subject.Stone's direction is powerful, as he tells the story of District Attorney Jim Garrison's pursuit of the truth. The ensemble cast, which includes Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Bob Hoskins, Jack Lemmon and Jim Garrison himself, portray the participants very convincingly. Cinematography is superb, as is John Williams' score.I did find 'J.F.K.' a little long, and I had to force myself to concentrate. However, contrary to popular opinion, I found the film got better and more intriguing toward the end, with the unnecessary parts being more toward the beginning. All in all though, a very powerful, riveting and eye-opening movie.Why was John Fitzgerald Kennedy assassinated, and who benefited?Tuesday, February 11, 1992 - Knox District CentreEven though Oliver Stone's epic takes some staying power, it is a fascinating look at the controversial assassination of President Kennedy. All the performances are very good, especially Joe Pesci and Kevin Bacon, and Kevin Costner makes a convincing 'Garrison'.The hardest cynic would most likely have trouble walking away from this film unconvinced, as it is quite one-sided. On the whole though it is an eye-opening and even spine chilling film which has been brought to the screen very professionally.Saturday, September 5, 1992 -Video",9,6,22,26 August 2007
Good Will Hunting," Garbled Nonsense
","Too much stilted dialogue and formulated diatribes, that you just can't accept as being spur of the moment conversation, totally deflate this film. The cast don't quite manage to say what you're pleading them to, then they come out with garbled nonsense.The cast have delivered some great performances, especially Robin Williams, who had little to work with. Matt Damon is also strong, as the math genius struggling to break free from the ghost of his childhood. Minnie Driver is a true natural as the English student who desperately wants to win his heart. Such a shame the poorly written characters gave these talented thesps nothing to bite into. Each player too often behaves inexplicably, thus Gus Van Sant (or whoever was directing - it is rumoured screenwriters Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had more control over proceedings than the credited director) was unable to endear us to these people.The script's noble intentions fall flat as 'Good Will Hunting' turns up nothing in its search. With the exception of one or two funny scenes, the humour misses the mark too.With this pic nominated for best film, along with three other rather under par selections - 'As Good as it Gets', 'The Full Monty' and 'L.A. Confidential', 'Titanic' should clean sweep this year's Oscars.Sunday, March 14, 1998 - Knox District Centre",4,3,6,28 August 2008
Schindler's List," Recognition for Spielberg long overdue
","I think I can safely say that Steven Spielberg is without a doubt the most talented film director of all time. Given any subject matter to cover, or any genre in which to film, he is able to produce movies of unsurpassed brilliance. Whether it be science-fiction, adventure, action, comedy or drama, his genius prevails every time, as he manages to 'entertain' in each of these fields.'Schindler's List' may or may not be his best ever work, but it most certainly is his most important. The story of Oskar Schindler, member of the Nazi Party, womaniser and business entrepreneur, is an amazing tale of how the Lord God has provided for his people Israel. Schindler saved over one thousand Jews from the atrocities of Nazi death camps and so ensured that generations would continue until time's end.Spielberg's perception and new found maturity shines as he presents us with a beautifully judged, understated work. He never allows the horrible violence to become gratuitous, and his decision to film in black and white again shows his marvellous insight. Spielberg knew that he would be mistaken to lend colour to such a dark period in history.Backing Spielberg up of course were some fine cast and crew members too, and the seven Academy Awards that 'Schindler' won is indicative of its' very professional production values. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski uses the camera to full effect, bringing us some stunning pictures. Michael Kahn's film editing is very efficient and John Williams again scores the perfect music. Spielberg was also very grateful to Steven Zaillian, saying that his adapted screenplay (from Thomas Keneally's novel 'Schindler's Ark') was beautifully understated and restrained.The cast round off the whole show with strong performances. The ever enjoyable Ben Kingsley plays a major role as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, and does so very well, but not as well as the brilliant Ralph Fiennes, whose portrayal of twisted and sadistic Commandant Amon Goeth is outstanding, and must have narrowly missed out on an Academy Award. Of course we shouldn't forget lead player Liam Neeson, whose more than convincing performance was well worthy of the Oscar nomination it received.'Schindler's List' is a numbing and all too disturbing film that conscientious movie-goers must no miss! After deservedly receiving both the best picture and best director Oscars for the first time, Steven Spielberg pleaded with all educators world wide to teach these horrors of the Jewish holocaust in our schools so that we would never forget.I have said before that Spielberg will probably never eclipse 'E.T.' for sheer wonderment, and the same must be said about 'Schindler's List' for the fact of its sheer magnitude. 'Schindler' is Steven Spielberg's crowning glory. It has given him the recognition that was long overdue him, and has also established him as perhaps the greatest film maker of all time. Congratulations Steven, and thank you!Wednesday, March 23, 1994 - Balwyn Cinema'Schindler's List' is even better on a return viewing. One is able to acquire a deeper understanding of Oskar Schindler the person and his motivations. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is exquisite in both its detail and its simplicity, adapted superbly from Thomas Kenneally's novel 'Schindler's Ark'.Director Steven Spielberg handles all aspects of his film with quiet assuredness, producing a profoundly moving, shocking and revolutionary piece that is almost perfectly weighted, and deftly understated. Spielberg's labour of love is truly the work of a dedicated director.John William's score is a masterpiece of melodic orchestration, being quietly soothing. Michael Kahn's editing (Academy Award winning) is very astute, Janusz Kaminski's camera is very probing and unnerving, capturing some very memorable scenery. The costumes, Art Direction and Set Decoration departments have outdone themselves in recreating war time Europe.Acting is outstanding, starting with Liam Neeson, who is even better than I recall. His dramatically profound performance is probably the most important of his life. Neeson is truly haunting as he makes Schindler his own. Ben Kingsley is at his competent best in the role of the tentative but brilliant accountant Itszhak Stern, a perfectly weighted showing. Powerful support also comes from Embeth Davidtz and Caroline Goodall.Final word goes to Ralph Fiennes who, in the role of the sadistic, twisted Commandant Amon Goeth, is chillingly brilliant and mesmerisingly effective. A real find of the year, Fiennes deservedly won an Oscar nomination and followed this success with another strong showing as Charles Van Doren in Robert Redford's 'Quiz Show'.'Schindler's List' clean swept the 1993 Academy Awards, and so it should have. Spielberg's most intellectually deep, affecting and historically important film is his crowning glory. A must see, though it is at times emotionally upsetting. It is thus hard to describe as fantastic, but one must! Unforgettable!Saturday, December 30, 1995 - Video",9,9,13,28 December 2007
The Elephant Man," Gentle, moving tragedy
","Rather a surprise is this gentle, moving tragedy from director David Lynch. From the simple screenplay based on Frederick Treves' novel 'The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences', comes the heart-rending tale of a critically deformed man who is rescued from a cruel 'master' by a compassionate surgeon.The film features some sublime cinematography and a melodic musical score. Lynch controls and directs his film beautifully.Undoubtedly the strongest point of the film is the acting though. John Hurt, though virtually unrecognisable, is simply amazing as the intelligent, warm-hearted and gifted man trapped in a physically horrendous body. Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully understated as the benevolent doctor, and Freddie Jones is superb as the drunken ne'er-do-well who has cashed in on the Elephant Man's misfortune. In support is a touching Anne Bancroft. Simply one of the most poignant and brilliantly acted films of that time.Monday, April 5, 1999 - Video",8,1,2,9 April 2010
Amadeus," Grand Production
","Milos Forman's epic dramatisation of the life and times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart sadly loses much of its impact when viewed on the small screen.Mozart's story unfolds through the eyes of Saleiri, the Italian composer who grew to resent his young colleague's genius, which far overshadowed his own modest musical talents. Tom Hulce paints us a fantastic picture of the eccentric Mozart, while F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of the bitter Saleiri is full of passion.The Art Direction and Set Decoration are excellent, and the costumes splendid. Milos Forman directs with competence and finesse, and of course a fine musical score tops it all off. Very impressive viewing. Just a shame about the rather weak ending, which leaves one a little disappointed. Wish I saw it at the cinema.Sunday, February 23, 1992 - Video",6,2,7,29 August 2007
The Game," Edge of your seat film captivates with stunts and scares
","Full of stunts and scares aplenty, 'The Game' features a very clever plot that captivates throughout, often drawing you to the edge of your seat. This intriguing thriller then becomes too neat and loses its vice-like grip in an ending whose tidiness spoils what was until then a dark, scary and baffling film. The tricky denouement ends up being too clever for its own good, and may leave an enthralled audience disappointed.Michael Douglas again produces the goods in another nail-biter as a ruthless but uptight executive whose world is utterly inverted when he is thrust headlong into 'The Game'. Viewers will have no problem believing his terror and desperation at every turn of the slick plot. Strong too is the support cast, including a little seen Sean Penn as the younger brother who introduces Douglas to the life changing mayhem that is 'The Game'.David Fincher's direction keeps things bounding at a rate of knots, ensuring the audience remains riveted. I found it surprising though that Fincher (of 'Alien3' and 'Seven' fame) did not supply a more unnerving, sinister ending.Saturday, October 4, 1997 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase",6,0,1,3 July 2008
Ghostbusters," Surprise Hit of '84
","Reitman's best, most successful film he has ever made was this catchy comedy which turned out to be 1984's surprise hit thanks to the impeccable timing of its release.The leading trio play off each other sublimely, with Murray as the prankster and both Aykroyd and Ramis in top form playing two rather socially inept scientists whose joint obsession with New York's ghostly inhabitants leads the 'Ghostbusters' to fame and fortune. Sigourney Weaver plays the humorous love interest who turns nasty when spectral activity becomes centred around her apartment. Also hilarious is Rick Moranis as the dorky accountant who becomes an unlikely 'Keymaster' in the closing scenes of the film. Annie Potts plays the over worked secretary, Ernie Hudson the hired fourth Ghostbuster and William Atherton is the thorn in the side from the Environmental Protection Agency.Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis have written the screenplay which is quite sharp in both the freshness of the idea and the execution of the plot. The jaunty momentum and bright comedy is prevalent throughout. Visually we are treated to some attention grabbing special f/x which dominate the 'Ghostbusters' encounters with the spooks. Finally there is the trendy soundtrack which features the smash hit single 'Ghostbusters' from Ray Parker Junior.Saturday, September 27, 1997 - Video",6,3,6,28 June 2008
Back to the Future Part III," Fun Finale
","The conclusion to this 'time-travelling-trilogy' is somewhat more subdued and most will find the pace of 'Future 3', which finds Marty and the Doc in the 'Old West', a lot easier to follow.Robert Zemeckis returns here to the formula that made the 1985 original such a hit. While nowhere near as good, the plot is simpler and funnier than number two. The cast are once again enjoyable, and the finale well-staged and exciting. In this final chapter, the story has become a little corny, especially the very end with its unnecessary 'happy ending' and annoying moral message. However, Spielberg and Co. have delivered a fun finish to this fantastically popular trilogy.Wednesday, February 12, 1992 - Laser Disc",6,0,0,27 August 2007
Donnie Brasco," True Crime Story
","Based upon the truest of true stories, 'Donnie Brasco' presents us with a thoroughly researched look at an influential crime family that is undone by a Federal agent who literally becomes one of them. The film is based on Joe Pistone's autobiographical novel which details his infiltration of a world that rarely allows outsiders in.The film's problem is, it lacks a beginning, a middle, and an end. Or the basic elements of a story. Sure this is based on reality, yet 'Donnie Brasco' is no more than an episode in the life of some gangsters and an undercover agent. It is hard, therefore, for the audience to really get involved, especially given the lack of background we get regarding Donnie and his cohorts.Having said this, the pic is well made and solidly acted, with Depp again impressing as the title character who is at war within himself and with those he loves over who he is. The film is made for Al Pacino, who slides into the role of the world weary gangster who adopts 'Donnie Brasco' and grooms him as he would have a son. Also stars Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby and Anne Heche, very strong as the neglected wife of an agent who has forgotten what he was.Friday, August 14, 1998 - Video",6,0,0,26 February 2010
The Piano," Beautifully produced drama fails to hit home
","Critically acclaimed across the nation, 'The Piano' attempts to tell the tale of the tragic Ada, who, unable to speak after an horrific accident, is married off by her father to a New Zealander whom she has never met. And so she must travel to this far away, foreign land with her daughter in order to meet her new husband and start over.Holly Hunter is very impressive as Ada McGrath, the mute Scot who is so very much out of her element in rugged, muddy New Zealand. As Stewart, her new partner, Sam Neill impresses as well, while Harvey Keitel (in an unaccustomed role) delivers a wonderfully weighted, show stealing performance. Special mention too must go to Ana Paquin as Ada's little girl Flora.Writer-director Jane Campion's film is visually splendid too (cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh), and features some truly marvelous music from the pen of Michael Nyman. Sadly though the film has a weak link which really lets the whole production down. The script comes off very distant and aloof, as we are stunned by most of the events that shape the film, rather than moved as perhaps we should be. Campion's characters are so well portrayed, yet we find ourselves detached from them, unable to relate in any way to their feelings. Too much is left unexplained both about Ada, and the other important elements of 'The Piano'. Even the comedy seems remote, and although it is quite funny, it is a little too mistimed to come off effectively. Beautifully produced drama, but too far off to really hit home.Saturday, December 4, 1993 - Cinema Nova",6,2,6,7 December 2007
Jerry Maguire," Rewarding relationship tale
","Writer/director Cameron Crowe ('Say Anything' and 'Singles') seems to be very much in touch with human emotion as he penned this story about relationships. On the surface 'Jerry Maguire' appears to be about a down and out sports agent who is desperately trying to keep life and soul together as his world crumbles about him. Really though this touching, often funny film is primarily concerned with the relationships we have with the ones we love.Cruise has found some form again as he looks for true meaning in his work and his personal life, though he never seems to be able to get a handle on his emotions nor his true feelings. Renee Zellweger is also thoroughly enjoyable in her debut as the faithful accounts clerk who believes in Jerry's ideals more strongly than he does, but who ultimately only needs his love, not his admiration or friendship. Both the leads are easily, and quite willingly, outdone by young Jonathan Lipnick, too cute as Dorothy's six year old boy who steals many scenes and gets some of the funniest lines. A special mention must go to Cuba Gooding Junior in his Oscar winning role. His is a passionate portrayal of an aging footballer whose sincere love of his family is not reflected in his game. Also stars Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston, Regina King, Jerry O'Connell and Jay Mohr. Bruce Springteen's 'Secret Garden' provides a moving love theme.Many times Crowe seems more in tune with women's feelings than men's, so spot on are his female characters. A shame that such an insightful drama didn't have the morals nor the 'truth' to go with it (money doesn't matter, as long as you've got plenty of it seems rather a confused message). Still, a most rewarding pic.Friday, April 25, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",7,4,6,5 June 2008
Quiz Show," Will grip you and fascinate you easily
","Redford's fourth film as director once again shows his prodigious talent for turning the ordinary into excellent entertainment. Following on from 'Ordinary People', 'The Milagro Beanfield War' and 'A River Runs Through It' is 'Quiz Show', which uncovers the startling corruption that was apparently rife in 50's and 60's television when game show producers would rig their programs by supplying the answers to the contestant they felt the audience wanted to win.Redford demonstrates amazing control and really knows how to tell a fascinating story. He imbues the entire movie with powerful dramatic scenes that blend to make a marked impact. 'Quiz Show' may not present an outrageously shocking topic, yet Mr. Redford is able to turn it into an amazing and engrossing tale which demands your full attention.A truly superlative cast is headed up by Rob Morrow, who makes a strong impression as Richard Goodwin, the Congressional committee investigator upon whose book the film is based. John Turturro ('Miller's Crossing') is again outstanding as Herb Stempel, the average Joe who rockets to international fame via '21', and Ralph Fiennes backs up his incredible performance as Amon Goeth in 'Schindler's List' with another all round showing as the troubled new '21' champ Charles Van Doren. Veteran British actor Paul Scofield is also quite impressive as Van Doren's father in an Oscar nominated supporting role.Art Directors, Set Decorators and Costume Designers have all recreated the 1950's splendidly while writer Paul Attanasio takes us right back to the emotion and feeling of New York in that period.Redford establishes his grip early and never releases it, ensuring the viewer is fully entertained for the duration by what is a marvellous film which notably gained four Oscar nominations, including best film, director and adapted screenplay.Sunday, March 12, 1995 - Qantas Airways Flight'Quiz Show' thoroughly deserved the Oscar nominations it garnered for 1994, if only for pure class. Top direction from Robert Redford, who turns an otherwise uninteresting topic into a riveting film, concerning the conspiracy that ruined the 'Quiz Show' known as '21'. Redford shows real expertise as he controls every scene whilst adding a touch of style to the whole production. What a shame this is only his fourth film in some fourteen years.Technical credits are also outstanding, including Mark Isham's score, production design, costumes, sets and art. Every aspect recreates the late fifties with unerring excellence. Editing is astute and cinematography elaborate.Paul Attanasio does a top job with the script, giving it dramatic power, importance and some biting humour. Cast is fantastic, including Rob Morrow, who gobbles up the lead role as the investigator from the Committee for Legislative Oversight who first smells a rat in the game show's proceedings. Ralph Fiennes follows his knockout showing in 'Schindler's List' with another fine turn as Charles Van Doren, the new '21' champ who compromises his beliefs for fame and fortune. In support of these two is a strong back up cast including Paul Scofield, notable as Van Doren's respected professor father, and John Turturro, who is incredible as the disgruntled Jewish man Herb Stempel who has blown his '21' winnings on a bookie.Saturday, March 16, 1996 - Video",7,1,1,8 February 2008
Toy Story," Entertaining for all
","Cleverly crafted Disney production has plenty to laugh at for both younger and more mature audiences. The innovative idea creates a world in which children's toys come to life in their own universe; the bedroom.While the animation is not exactly state of the art any more, the pic benefits from some jovial, whole-hearted performances. Especially of note is the irrepressible Tom hanks as Woody, Andy's favourite toy (until now), and Tim Allen, hilariously deadpan as space ranger Buzz Lightyear, the new guy in town.The comedy stays fresh and lively throughout while there is always something happening to keep little eyes tuned. Infinitely watchable, as Disney often is.Tuesday, December 1, 1998 - Video",7,1,1,23 March 2010
Chariots of Fire," Unforgettable
","Hugh Hudson's film about British runners Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell and their exploits at the Games of the VIII Olympiad in 1924, is an inspirational and heart warming movie.Abrahams is an athlete driven by the desire to win at all costs, while Scotsman Liddell derives his motivation from his love of God. Cross and Charleson are perfect in the lead roles while the supporting cast is also excellent, especially Ian Holm as 'Sam Mussambini'.Our director has kept the plot simple, and allowed the performers to do the work. 'Chariots of Fire' is technically impressive too, with good cinematography and a magnificent soundtrack from Vanjelis. A must see, unforgettable movie experience.Thursday, July 30, 1992 - VideoHudson's marvellous film is both inspirational and uplifting. 'Chariots of Fire' superbly tells the tale of two very determined athletes, 'Harold Abrahams' and 'Eric Liddell', who both competed in the 1924 Paris Olympics.Both leading actors capture their respective characters brilliantly, with Ben Cross as the strong headed Abrahams, and Ian Charleson as the devout and sturdy Liddell.

The movie tries to be one of these new, quirky romantic-comedies - like 'The Wedding Singer' - only fails.Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz fall flat in the lead, while Matt Dillon and Lee Evans go down fighting.

Mission: Impossible," Action the order of the day
","Action is the order of the day when remaking a t.v. smash hit like the ever popular 'Mission : Impossible'. With this in mind, top line scripters David Koepp, Steven Zaillian and Robert Towne, along with director Brian DePalma, have produced a film complimented with tense, nerve racking scenes and adrenalin pumping action, while the f/x pros supply all the hi-tech gadgetry synonymous with 'the team'.Tom Cruise, star and co-producer this time, is Ethan Hawke, hot shot point man for Jim Phelps' elite band of covert operatives who undertake those deadly, imperative top secret missions that no-one else can handle. When the team is ambushed and Hawke comes out unscathed, he is immediately suspect and must prove himself innocent of the charge of betrayal, all the while avoiding capture. This catalyst sets the film going as Ethan finds a couple of sympathisers in the disavowed Krieger and Luther. With their help Hawke begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and starts to uncover the identity of the real mole.Whole cast are thoroughly enjoyable, with Cruise leading the way, supported by the lovely Emmanuelle Beart, the increasingly entertaining duo of Jean Reno ('Krieger') and Ving Rhames ('Luther'), and Jon Voight as group leader Jim Phelps. There are a couple of surprise cameos too, form the likes of Kristin Scott-Thomas and Vanessa Redgrave. Obviously it's the look, the pace and the seemingly complex plot that really make the film however.Cinematography, art and sets are all eye catching as the action jumps from one continent to another and back again. Special effects crew (the amazing ILM) save their best for last in the mind blowing finale, set in the London to Paris rail tunnel. Editing keeps the tempo nicely upbeat, while the groovy original theme (Lalo Schifrin) and new music (Danny Elfman) provide fantastic backing.The most effective piece of film making has come from director DePalma and his screenwriters. In presenting the storyline very patchily, it appears to have more depth and intrigue than is the case. The plot presentation is so vague in fact that many viewers have complained about being unable to follow the narrative. In truth, the basic premise and outlay are very simple, yet elusive in detail, thus gaining maximum points from audiences seeking a twisting, winding tale. Careful scrutiny and a little analytical after thought will dissolve the mystery and help you understand what went on.Not quite a master stroke, but 'Mission : Impossible' is a flash of genius in the making of an action/thriller form the multi-talented, hit and miss Brian DePalma. Tom Cruise fans, you're in for a treat!Wednesday, July 24, 1996 - Knox District CentreDe Palma's sharply twisting action pic features an expertly arranged screenplay which milks maximum effect from the deceptively complex story.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Loads of fun, but not very fresh
","The 'McCallister' family are at it again, this time on the way to Florida. Once again they somehow manage to lose young 'Kevin', who soon finds himself 'Lost in New York'.The whole cast returns for what turns out to be a repeat performance of the 1990 smash hit comedy. John Hughes and Chris Columbus show absolutely no sense of adventure as the plot is almost a carbon copy of the first. The only thing that has changed is the setting.Fans won't be disappointed though, as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are once again at it as the newly named 'sticky bandits', and they're joined by the wonderful Tim Curry, who is marvelously funny. Loads of fun, but not very fresh. Also starred Brenda Fricker and Dana Ivey.Saturday, December 12, 1992 - Knox District Centre",6,0,1,24 October 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Signature Tarantino full of surprises
","The signature unpredictability, small talk and razor sharp dialogue was clearly evident in this impressive debut feature from 'Pulp Fiction' director Quentin Tarantino.'Reservoir Dogs' tells the ultra-violent, gratuitous and even occasionally gruesome story of a robbery gone wrong and the aftermath which turns into a bloody inquisition between those who got out alive. Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel all give first rate performances as the three criminals who arrive first at the predetermined meeting point and immediately begin the investigation to uncover the rat that blew their cover. Strong support is supplied by Michael Madsen, Christopher Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Randy Brooks and Quentin himself.Tarantino employs the blackest of humour, but this movie is especially twisted and bent, far more so the 'Pulp Fiction'. Look out for the scene in which 'Mr. Blonde' (Madsen) interrogates a cop to the tune of Stealers Wheel's 'Stuck in the Middle With You'. A warning to the squeamish to close their eyes for that one.'Reservoir Dogs' is self-indulgent, and too much so. Several scenes have a marked impact and really stand out, while others are far too drawn out and self interested, rather than being the brief, meaningful encounters they should have been. The idea of telling the events non-chronologically works brilliantly however, as it did in 'Pulp'. This method ensures the narrative is full of surprises, and Tarantino astounds us with some wildly unexpected turns in his plot.There's a groovy 70's soundtrack, some stunning cinematography and some reasonable editing to top off this amazing story.Saturday, February 18, 1995 - Video",7,0,1,7 February 2008
Total Recall," Violent fast-paced sci-fi action
","Amazing special effects and a lightening fast script keep you interested in this very violent Arnold Schwarzenegger science-fiction action flick.Director Paul Verhoeven has created (with a little help from some special effects experts I'm sure) an eye-popping film that follows our hero from earth to Mars as he tries to find out who he really is. To tell any more of the plot would not be fair, or very easy I assure you. Some may find this frantic story line a little confusing. However, 'Total Recall' is never dull and both Arnie fans and action fans should give this one a hundred and nine minutes of their time.Tuesday, September 17, 1991 - Video",7,1,3,4 August 2007
Rocky," A winner
","From director John G. Avildsen comes a very good story of down and out fighter 'Rocky' Balboa, who, against the odds, takes the world champ, Apollo Creed, fifteen rounds; something never before achieved. This film made Sylvester Stallone the household name he is today; forever synonymous as he is with the lead character.Writing as well as playing the lead role, Sylvester Stallone dispenses with razzmatazz and delivers the goods from the heart. Talia Shire (as Adrienne) and Burgess Meredith (as Mickey) are very good indeed, while Burt Young and Carl Weathers lend support. An honest and believable movie, this Best Picture (1976) is a winner!Sunday, February 10, 1991 - Video",7,0,1,29 January 2007
Shine," Several strong, moving moments
","'Shine' has been heavily touted, endlessly praised and constantly raved about since its release over a year ago. Having not seen this reputedly magnificent film, I could only imagine what I was missing. That is, until now.'Shine' does just that, it shines in several strong, moving moments as director Scott Hicks tells us the story of the incredible David Helfgott, an immensely talented musician (prodigy is perhaps more apt) whose tortured youth sees him almost lost to life itself. David bounces back though thanks to the love of good friends and wife Gillian. He returns with a passion for life that is reflected in his astounding, energetic performances.Jan Sardi provides the simple screenplay that tells the forceful tale, though it does seem to sell us short at the conclusion. Scott Hicks shows signs of a talented director, but not all his ideas come off. Enough of his work is effective though, and I am looking forward very much to his next project.Geoffrey Rush captures the essence of the adult Helfgott skilfully, and his performance earned him a best actor Oscar. I can't help feeling that for the most part Rush shows a master of imitation, rather than acting. In any case he is outshone by an incredibly powerful turn from Noah Taylor who is outstanding as the young David who leaves his family to pursue a career, only to self destruct at the gateway to greatness. Strong in support are Armin Mueller-Stahl as David's obsessive father Peter, Lyn Redgrave as devoted wife Gillian and Sir John Gielgud as English professor and mentor, Cecil Parkes.Vicki Niehus' production design is impressive, and the cinematography from Geoffrey Simpson is pleasing to the eye. The all important music score is from David Hirschfelder.Monday, July 21, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon",7,1,1,28 June 2008
Pretty Woman," Modern Fairy Tale
","From director Garry Marshall comes the box office smash 'Pretty Woman', a pretty good film about a fairy tale love affair between very rich business man Richard Gere and the gorgeous hooker with a heart Julia Roberts.The script from writer J. F. Lawton is unfortunately predictable and his material is paper thin, however Garry Marshall still manages to entertain us with the movie's likable characters, and a good balance of humour and drama. Gere and Roberts are a well-matched team, and support from Jason Alexander, Laura San Giacomo and the ever resourceful Hector Elizondo is timely.Sunday, March 24, 1991 - Video",6,0,1,23 April 2007
Pulp Fiction," What a rush!
","Quentin Tarantino is a cinematic genius! If you don't believe me just treat yourself to his fantastic 'Pulp Fiction', a dark, sharp, black as black comedy thriller concerning a few days in the lives of some desperate LA characters.Our prodigious director co-wrote the script (with Roger Avary), which contains some absolutely brilliant dialogue. This supreme black comedy has such a distinct laconic wit that you'll find yourself breaking up at the most gruesome and disturbing of scenes. The film's thriller element is at times chillingly effective, creating with ease heart pounding tension that will have you fidgeting in your seat and drying your hands on the legs of your trousers.The story itself, or three stories in one actually, is a fascinating tale of double-cross which will completely involve you, as will the equally fascinating character study which lies within the intriguing plot. There are some amazing people in 'Fiction'! The total un-predictability of the movie works to perfection, as Tarantino controls and manipulates his audience whilst entertaining brilliantly throughout. He deliberately unsettles us early so that we're never comfortable, then draws us in effortlessly as the narrative unfolds. The finale is very satisfying (more than so), yet leaves you itching and pleading for an encore. This is highly addictive cinema! You never know who's gonna do what to whom, where the next sucker punch is coming from nor the next razor sharp line.The bold format works excellently, with the non-chronological sequence being a real plus. Apparently the original concept was to have the script 'linear', but the fact that this removed some main characters early in the piece was found to be unsatisfactory, and so a re-write was ordered. The result is astonishingly effective, and the editing is truly inspired, maintaining the ideal pace.Tarantino's film is graphically violent yet superbly visual, containing some startling cinematography and much effective imagery, including one particular hard drug scene that leaves a marked impression.Finally, one of the film's strongest points is the powerful acting. Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth are first on the scene giving us two great performances as the picture's initial desperate criminals. As a hippie drug dealer and his severely body-pierced wife, Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette both make solid impressions, as do Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself. In the more pivotal roles are Bruce Willis as reckless boxer Butch, Ving Rhames as crime-lord Marsellus Wallace, Uma Thurman as the sexy drug-fiend Mrs. Wallace and John Travolta as Marsellus' Italian hit man Vincent Vega. All give strong showings. Frank Whaley and Christopher Walken also drop in on the action, but the plum role goes to Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winfield. Jackson gets all the very best lines and the most interesting character by far, and his performance is sensational, worthy of acknowledgment at the highest level.I could go on and on about what I consider to be the film of 1994 by a long shot. Quentin Tarantino will have you eating out of the palm of his hand. Even though the black comedy gangster thriller is a well worn genre, the movie's amazing originality will blow you out of the theatre, while its confronting and astounding style and layout will really keep you thinking. What a rush!Sunday, December 11, 1994 - Knox District CentreFriday, February 10, 1995 - Village Centre MelbourneMonday, February 27, 1995 - Kuhio Twins HonoluluHaving seen Tarantino's violent, graphic landmark 'Pulp Fiction' four times, I must confess that even though it is a remarkable piece of story telling, it does tend to wear a little thin.Without the surprise element with which he so easily manipulates his audience first time around, Tarantino must rely on the depth and genius of his writing, and the shrewdness of his direction and the editing. In this light 'Pulp Fiction' does tend to be over long and perhaps over indulgent, and may have even worked just as well in chronological order (haven't I changed my tune).On the other hand, all the outstanding performances certainly hold up to repeat viewings. As the thinking man's gangster, Samuel L. Jackson delivers a veritable tour-de-force in what is possibly the performance of 1994. John Travolta's showing is stylish and controlled, Uma Thurman proves herself to be a real handful, overdosing or otherwise, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames are both ideally cast and make the very most of their characters, Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth (Honeybunny and Pumpkin) are incredible in their small roles (you could make a movie spin-off based on those two!), Christopher Walken's walk in is significant but rather drawn out, and both Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette are terrific as the young marrieds selling and doing drugs (every scene of theirs is extremely funny).One may conclude that 'Pulp Fiction' could have been just as effective twenty minutes shorter, but who's complaining. The film is ultra-violent, so the squeamish should avoid it, as should those who don't enjoy contemplative, thought provoking cinema. Movie goers really need to be alert to put all the pieces together, and also to appreciate all the philosophical dialogue from Jules and Vincent. Most will find Tarantino's small talk both ingenious and amazingly true to life, as well as incredibly hilarious.Sunday, July 9, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",8,1,3,29 January 2008
Titanic," Grand Production of an Amazing Tale
","James Cameron has come of age in delivering this grand production of an amazing tale, one of the most fascinating true stories around. 'Titanic' is every bit as good as everyone has been saying. You can see the three hundred million dollars up on the screen. Authenticity is second to none, as new footage is seamlessly faded in from old. Spectacular and awesome to say the least.All the facts and events are so fascinating you hardly need the human story provided. I certainly could have watched this as a documentary. James Cameron has left nothing to chance. I am hard pressed to imagine 'Titanic' done better.The cast are all spot on and thoroughly enjoyable! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal devil-may-care Yankee who wins a ticket to sail to New York. Kate Winslett is perfect as the well-to-do little rich girl who hates her existence and Billy Zane is at his impressive best as the possessive fiancé who is heir to millions. The superlative support cast includes Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Johnathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart and Suzy Amis.Grand, often haunting music is from Cameron regular James Horner. Editing is smart, and the film passes quickly though it is over three hours. The technical team have performed brilliantly, with computer graphics a particular treat. Set decoration (including a near to scale replica and incredibly intricate interiors) and Art Design are both amazing, recreating the most gallant ship of all with unerring grandeur and style. Cinematography sweeps through it all with panache.After viewing this, you'll feel you were there! Don't miss your chance to see this at the movies. I will certainly be boarding again!Saturday, February 28, 1998 - Village Sunshine Gold ClassIn an era basically void of epics, James Cameron has managed to produce a film that measures up with the likes of 'Ben Hur'. Grand, stylish, sweeping and larger than life is the best way to describe this astounding cinematic experience. I freely admit that I was one of the many cynics who, having heard of the film's monstrous budget, thought that 'Titanic' would be the biggest flop of all time. I, like many, felt this 300 million dollar production would sink faster than the great ship herself.That was not the case, as history will now show, as 'Titanic' has gone on to smash box office records, collecting a record equalling eleven Academy Awards along the way. The film's visuals alone justify this, with the ship of dreams brought fantastically back to life thanks to some awesome set design, huge scale replicas and access to the original blueprints. Mind blowing special effects, coupled with superior sound editing, make 'Titanic' a must at the movies (preferably one with Digital Sound and a huge screen).Cameron brings it all together brilliantly, backed up as he is by a thoroughly enjoyable cast, including Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton and Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown. Final master stroke comes from maestro James Horner, whose haunting, beautiful score is the spirit of 'Titanic', which of course inspired the love theme (a song Jim Cameron never wanted originally) 'My Heart Will Go On'.Saturday, May 30, 1998 - Knox District CentreJim Cameron's grand film of the fateful 'Titanic' and her maiden voyage loses a great deal of its impact if viewed on anything other than a huge screen. It is still a fascinating tale of how the ship of dreams went to the bottom of the Atlantic for all the wrong reasons.Forget about DiCaprio (miscast) and Winslet (charming), they are mere scenery in a fascinating true story. All those mistakes! Not enough life boats, which weren't filled anyway. Only one boat returning for survivors. Going full speed with virtually zero visibility, no binoculars on the lookout. People locked behind gates below deck, and a seaman who tried to round a giant iceberg in an enormous ship that 'doesn't turn worth a dime'. If the Titanic had've struck head on, it would have stayed afloat.Special effects, sets and costumes are all awesome, but you do really need that huge screen. James Horner's score is top stuff too.Saturday, January 2, 1999 - Video",7,2,4,27 August 2008

He's still a lot of fun to root for. Good entertainment from the early eighties that makes good use of a music soundtrack including 'Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor.

The Untouchables," Grand and Stylish Entertainment
","Grand and stylish is the only way to describe this rewriting of the legend of Elliott Ness from director Brian De Palma. Many complained of 'The Untouchables' lack of historic accuracy, and even of its dissimilarity to the Robert Stack t.v. series. All I can say is thank goodness on both counts. De Palma's film is a work of fiction, a piece of entertainment in every sense of the word.The excellence is evident from the ground up, starting with the gorgeous costumes from the classy menswear outfit, Georgio Armani. Art Direction is out of this world (William A. Elliott), recreating Prohibition era Chicago with grand assuredness, using the actual streets and settings. All those model-T's look great. Cinematographer Stephen H. Burum has a field day capturing the lavish sets (Capone's hotel suite, the specially washed Chicago streets). His work, during sequences such as the Canadian border raid and the train station shoot out, is spectacular. Burum also cleverly makes use of the fantastic architecture in several scenes by filming from the ground looking up. This also makes the characters appear larger than life.Ennio Morricone's score is one of the best I've ever heard. The commanding 'Strength of the Righteous (Main Title)' draws out the suspense dramatically, the 'Death Theme' is tragically poignant, his 'Machine Gun Lullaby' is a melodic work of genius and the 'End Title' is one of the most rousing themes ever composed.Screenwriter David Mamet has provided an exciting story, varied (likeable and loathsome) characters, and he dresses it all with sharp, incisive, biting and all together entertaining dialogue. Grand and stylish acting brings Mamet's characters to life. Costner solidly portrays the beyond reproach law man who allows himself to become corruptible in order to do justice. Good too is Andy Garcia as the rookie prodigy Stone, who joins the team in pursuit of Capone. Out shining these two easily are Sean Connery as world weary Irish cop Malone, and Robert De Niro, mesmerising as the megalomaniacal gangster boss who has a special speech for all occasions. When words fail though, look out. Charles Martin Smith comes close to these two as Oscar Wallace, the rather enthusiastic accountant who sets up the case against Capone.De Palma shapes all the above into a film that is dramatic, tense, forceful, funny and tragic all at once. Coupled with this are the movie's numerous scenes of power, the train station and the gangster banquet being just two. Truly every scene has a measured impact, thanks to Mamet's amazing scripting. 'The Untouchables' is a real victory for De Palma, Mamet, Connery, De Niro and a host of technical professionals.Monday, July 7, 1997 - Astor TheatreI know I always open by calling this film grand, but that's what it is. From William A. Elliot's awesome sets, the superb costumes, Stephen H. Burum's classy cinematography and even Ennio Morricone's music (the best theme ever written for a movie), the whole picture is dripping with style.De Palma directs with a flair and purpose that he's never really shown before or since, while the perfect cast have a field day with David Mamet's razor sharp script. Costner is the epitome of incorruptible law, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith great value as a sharp-shooter and a dedicated accountant respectively. It I s scene-chewers Sean Connery and Robert De Niro who put the icing on the cake though. Connery's world-weary Irish cop won him a deserved Oscar, while De Niro is at his chilling best bringing Al Capone to life. The pair gobble up scene after scene, and it's a good thing they don't appear together (save for a brief moment). Who would cope?! See it at the movies!Saturday, June 20, 1998 - Video",8,0,1,28 June 2008
Die Hard," Great movie, possibly best ever action film
","A fantastic film, John McTiernan's 'Die Hard' is one of the best action productions of recent times. Bruce Willis is cool and effective as the 'human' hero as he sweats his way through each brilliantly choreographed action sequence, delivering his one-liners with perfect timing. He gets great support from Reginald Veljohnson, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov and a very impressive Alan Rickman as terrorist leader Hans. Michael Kamen's clever music makes good use of 'Ode to Joy' as it sways from one mood to another. Our director keeps the film rolling at a good pace, balancing the drama and tension well and never allowing the suspense to let up.There are a few slight draw backs. The annoying characters of news reporter Dick Thornberg and Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T. Robinson get on your nerves, as does the overkill type finale featuring vengeful terrorist Karl (Godunov). None of this takes anything away from a great film in which we constantly find ourselves on the edge of our seat waiting to see what will next befall our hero, John McLane.A must see film for every action or suspense fan. Take it from me, I saw it 8 times at the movies.Monday, May 11, 1992 - VideoDespite the several times I have seen this picture, which has resulted in my enjoyment diminishing somewhat, it still remains one of the most entertaining action films of all time.The annoyances which I have mentioned before do get more aggravating each time, but otherwise the action sequences and Willis' and Rickman's performances are great. The highlight for me this time was Michael Kamen's clever, quirky, Christmassy music. Great stuff.Friday, September 11, 1992 - Video",6,1,5,9 September 2007
Psycho," The master's masterpiece
","There have been many Hitchcock classics, but this is the ultimate, the master's masterpiece. I'm sure there is no need to divulge the plot as we would all be familiar with the evil goings on at the 'Bates Motel'. The cast are all spot on, as they play their parts with gusto, tongue in cheek and all. Miles and support are great, while Perkins and Janet Leigh are both marvelous as 'Norman Bates and Marion Crane respectively.'Psycho' is Hitchcock's greatest achievement. Filmed in black and white, this dark, dark black comedy was a great joke on his then petrified audience, who now can see the hidden humour. Bernard Herrman's riveting score is fabulous. An absolute must!Sunday, November 8, 1992 - VideoHitchcock's marvelous technique makes this superb film immensely enjoyable time and time again. The more one sees 'Psycho', the more one can appreciate the clever subtlety of his camera work, the darkness of his black humour and the sharpness of his direction, not to mention the brilliant performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.Yet for the first time viewer it still remains a wickedly manipulative movie which will shatter all your expectations.Fabulous!Saturday, October 9, 1993 - Video",9,0,0,20 October 2007
When Harry Met Sally...," Romantic comedy with attitude a disappointment
","Rob Reiner has presented us with the strong coming of age tale 'Stand by Me', the frightening 'Misery' (both penned by Stephen King) and the dramatically powerful 'A Few Good Men'. It seems a shame to have to group this somewhat contrived 'romantic comedy with attitude' in with such fine films. Alas this big disappointment from 1989 is also a Rob Reiner film.Billy Crystal's cynical eighties philosophies and morbid character make it hard for him to inspire the audience, and try as he might, he cannot manage to win anybody over for the entire film. Meg Ryan makes a pretty little damsel in confusion, but nothing else, while Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher just fill in the blanks.The final, and probably most crucial weakness in this picture is Nora Ephron's screenplay, which has several similarities to her more recent triumph 'Sleepless in Seattle'. Sure there are some very funny scenes and lines dotted throughout (especially the now famous restaurant scene), yet the comedy is largely inconsistent. For just 93 minutes, the movie really drags, and the whole destiny theme is too obvious, making it romantically predictable, like 'Sleepless'. Again the musical interludes just don't work, and so 'When Harry Met Sally' ends up relying entirely on its wit and the two lead performances, leaving it obviously lacking in entertainment value.Also, this 'girl thing/guy thing' Nora does, which almost pits man against woman, may be accurate occasionally, but it's far too negative for me. Certainly no substitute for entertainment of the calibre of 'While You Were Sleeping'.Friday, July 14, 1995 - Video",4,3,8,17 February 2008
All Quiet on the Western Front," Timeless Anti-War Sentiment
","From Erich Maria Remarque's classic novel comes this timeless piece of anti-war sentiment which would have been mightily powerful in 1930, yet is so much more subtle now in light of recent films on the same subject.Maxwell Anderson adapted the screenplay and Lewis Milestone directed a film which makes no apologies for being totally against sending young boys to their death for national pride, or whatever other crazy, high and mighty idea the powers that be may have.We follow young Paul Baumer and his school pals through the unforgiving trenches of World War I as they fight for the fatherland. The results are of course tragic. Before Paul's first leave of absence, only two of about fifteen boys remain alive, and only one has both his legs.Paul does much soul-searching throughout the film, and he is amazed at how euphoric he feels about life after the death of a close friend. He also finds he cannot stand being home, having become a creature of war, he cannot function in the normal world.Ayres performance is a moving one, and it is a great shame we are unable to get further into the mind of this young man via Milestone's film. Remarque's superb novel enabled us to delve deep into the psyche of a young man at war, with more than just the enemy confronting him. Alas screenwriter Anderson found it impossible to convey this on celluloid. The support cast do a most commendable job too (especially Louis Wolheim).Seeing this at a repertory theatre is recommended, if possible.Thursday, January 22, 1998 - Video",7,6,8,6 July 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Heartwarming Production
","Heartwarming production is a loving recreation of Harper Lee's novel concerning wicked racial prejudice in a small southern town in the early 30's. It's easy to see that both director Robert Mulligan and screenwriter Horton Foote were much taken by the original source.Having said this, the pair do allow the film too much time to get started and so it outstays its welcome just a touch. Most of the time though it's lighthearted good fun and strong human drama.The children bring us a great deal of laughter in this film, however it was Gregory Peck who was the Oscar winner as the small town lawyer who must defend an African-American against a trumped up charge in a very 'white' trial. Peck is assuredly solid as the single father who must explain the ways of the world to his children while trying to ensure justice is served.The winning combination of Mr. Peck's showing and Mr. Foote's Academy Award winning screenplay make 'To Kill a Mockingbird' a most enjoyable picture.Sunday, November 1, 1998 - Astor Theatre",7,1,2,8 March 2010
Scream 2," Lacks Something Vital
","Director Wes Craven continued where he left off with this sequel which attempts to take the mickey out of just that; sequels. Unfortunately, while he provides some clever insights into the secrets of the sequel, 'Scream 2' lacks something vital; a plot. Kevin Williamson was unable to provide any sort of story line.The survivors of the first film - Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette - return for more as they are again terrorised by a knife-wielding nutter. Jamie Kennedy, Laurie Metcalf and Sarah Michelle Gellar also join in the fun. Such a shame Craven's 'movie' movie is aloof, confused and derivative.Sunday, April 4, 1999 - Video",6,0,2,29 August 2008

This movie is reputed to be the closest anyone has come to the original story of the Transylvanian bloodsucker, 'Prince Vlad the Impaler', better known as 'Dracul'.The cast are competent, and Gary Oldman is uncanny and eerie as 'Dracula' (as he was in 'J.F.K.' as 'Oswald'). If you like the dark, macabre and surreal, you'll enjoy Coppolla's obsessive love story. For me though all the overpowering evil was a little too much. Not the stuff of which legends are made.Sunday, January 10, 1993 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase",3,1,2,28 October 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Loud, explosive overkill is the order of the day
","Sergeant John McLane gets his first chance to strut his stuff on home turf with this second sequel which heralds in a new setting whilst returning a familiar foe, of sorts. Original director John McTiernan (who was noticeably absent for 'Die Harder : Die Hard II') brings back much of the feel of the first adventure by styling this film on that 1988 box office sensation. Only this time, he doesn't keep us waiting for the action to begin.'Die Hard 3' opens with a bang and doesn't let up until Bruce Willis has capped the very last of the nasties. Suitably, and familiarly, tang topped and bloodied, Mr. Willis supplies the audience with plenty of grunts, sweat and one-liners to wholly entertain, all the while being backed up by reluctant side-kick Samuel L. Jackson, who appears to thoroughly enjoy this departure. Now there's an actor you couldn't begin to classify. Also most enjoyable is fine English actor Jeremy Irons, who makes a great villain as Simon Peter Gruber. A shame though that he didn't have enough meat to chew on, and a shame too that we don't see the talented Bonnie Bedelia (John's estranged wife Holly) at all. Musically, Michael Kamen again supplies the fitting soundtrack, which incorporates various themes very deftly.There is enough substance in the plot to sustain a fairly undemanding audience, but this is an action movie so, thinking should not be a prerequisite to enjoyment. Of course, if outrageous stunts, violent gunplay, spectacular special f/x, brilliant sound, a high body count and plenty of gore (not to mention bad guys that can't shoot straight - what other kind are there?) is not your scene, then you'd better go see 'While You Were Sleeping' instead! Loud, explosive overkill is the order of the day.Sunday, June 11, 1995 - Belgrave Cinemas",7,0,0,15 February 2008
Con Air," Formula Action works this time
","Another formula action film again works well, this time for director Simon West. Plenty of carnage, gunplay, explosions and hair raising stunts are thrown in. All the right people die, and all our heroes collectively save the day.The plot from Scott Rosenberg has enough in it to fuel proceedings, allowing you to follow the occasionally implausible script with ease, while never really making you care about the goings on. 'Con Air' is cleverly peopled with some complex (or diverse at least) criminal types who help raise the level of entertainment.John Malkovich is enjoyable as always playing the malevolent ringleader 'Cyrus the Virus', Ving Rhames likewise as protégé 'Diamond Dog'. Steve Buscemi takes the prize as the strangest of the lot though, playing a mentally ill psycho. Nicholas Cage fills in the space as everyman hero (often victim) Cameron Po, John Cusack is the Fed pursuing the gang, and the support cast includes Rachel Ticotin, Colm Meaney and Mykelti Williamson.Special visual and sound effects teams polish off this explosive, ultra slick nineties action flick.Friday, August 8, 1997 - Greater Union Melbourne",6,1,1,28 June 2008
The Mission," Fine film making lacks full impact
","Reputedly powerful film, but merely well made, about a mission in the South American jungle threatened with closure due to politics in the Vatican.Roland Joffe puts the movie together well, but still I find 'The Mission' does not have the real impact it could have had. The cinematography is magnificent, Ennio Morricone's score is haunting to say the very least, and all the cast, including Jeremy Irons, Robert De Niro and Aiden Quinn give strong performances. Sadly however, aside from all the superb craftsmanship of movie-making on offer here, 'The Mission' delivers little else in the way of entertainment. Please endeavour to see this on the big screen.Thursday, March 19, 1992 - Video",6,2,7,31 August 2007
The Green Mile," Moving, strong drama
","This moving, strong drama is well paced by Frank Darabont, who knows how to do this stuff (see 'The Shawshank Redemption'). His direction along with the familiar score from composer Thomas Newman gives one the strong feeling of 'deja-vu' at times. The original story was from the pen of Stephen King once again.Acting in this film may well be its strongest point. Tom Hanks masters yet another role as the practical warden of Cold Mountain Penitentiary. Excellent support come from Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene and many others. David Morse is especially memorable as Hanks' workmate Brutal. The darling of Hollywood now though is Michael Clarke Duncan, after his strong, emotional portrayal of the giant John Coffey who seems so out of place on death row.Yes the film could be called formulaic, following as it does a reasonably obvious path; and I really didn't like the behavior of certain characters that I thought were above certain responses. All this aside, this is a most enjoyable, entertaining outing from Darabont that touches the heart once again.Saturday, March 18, 2000 - Village Crown Gold Class",7,1,3,3 June 2010
Jaws," Just try and keep your eyes open
","Steven Spielberg has turned Peter Benchley's frightening best seller into a terrifying movie which understandably kept hoards of people out of the ocean in much the same way that 'Psycho' kept hoards out of their showers.The screenplay adaptation, by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, is very well balanced and the story is expertly handled by Spielberg as he slowly introduces us to the unsuspecting resort town of Amity, which is about to be torn apart by the most horrible of unseen terrors. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss all give strong performances, with Scheider as the new chief of police who never had a menace quite like this to deal with in New York, Shaw, who is impressive as cynical, wily old Mr. Quinn the shark hunter, and Dreyfuss, who gives a fine performance as hot shot oceanographer Matt Hooper.The special effects are convincing enough, at least enough to cause one's heart to race, and John William's much borrowed, re-used and copied music score is of course very effective.A wonderful, nerve-racking piece of entertainment from Spielberg which builds up from its tense beginning to a real heart-stopping climax, guaranteed to give you sweaty palms and leave your mouth dry, if you can keep your eyes open long enough.Sunday, January 30, 1994 - T.V.",8,0,2,21 December 2007
The Lion King," Whole family will thoroughly enjoy this one
","I have a confession to make. This is the first fully animated Disney production that I have ever seen! Perhaps some would say that I have begun at the wrong end (beside the fact that I have been living in a closet all my life), however 'The Lion King' (Disney's 32nd full length animated feature) has given me an inkling of what I may have been missing.Disney continue their recent trend of popular animated features by bringing us this tale about the circle of life. Young lion cub 'Simba', heir to his father 'King Mufasa's' throne, thinks there'll be nothing to assuming his rightful place at the top of the food chain. Things look terribly gloomy though when Simba's evil Uncle Scar kills Mufasa, takes his brother's place as king and drives poor Simba far from his home. The dramatic adventure story that unfolds from here is good, and will keep the kids involved, yet the movie's real strength is its sharp wit and very funny dialogue. Several moments will have you in stitches, while movie buffs will delight in 'performances' from many recognisable voices. James Earl Jones is an appropriate choice for Mufasa, Jeremy Irons' Scar is wonderfully sardonic, while comedienne Whoopi Goldberg is a real treat as a nasty Hyena. Listen too for the voices of Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, Cheech Marin, Robert Guillaume, Ernie Sabella, Nathan Lane and Moira Kelly.'The Lion King' is a joy musically too, with Hans Zimmer providing a vibrant African score and both Elton John and Tim Rice some catchy show numbers, including Elton's beautiful love theme 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' Disney's high production values are clearly evident in a fine animated film which the whole family is sure to thoroughly enjoy.Saturday, October 29, 1994 - Knox District Centre",6,2,5,26 January 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Emotionally Fulfilling
","From the director of 1990's 'Buried Alive' comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short novella 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary 'Red', the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise ('whatever you want') to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.'The Shawshank Redemption' is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that's what makes this story so great. 'The Shawshank Redemption' comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema'The Shawshank Redemption' was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can't go past 'The Shawshank Redemption.'Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre",8,8,14,19 February 2008
The Cannonball Run," Off-the-cuff comedy
","Off the cuff comedy, based upon the real trans-continental 'Cannonball Run', is a lot of laughs as many of our favourite action heroes poke fun at their own images. Especially enjoyable are Roger Moore and Jackie Chan sending up the heroic ideals that they usually portray.Plenty of chuckles are delivered by leads Burt Reynolds and Dom De Luise as they play off each other and off the comedy duo of Sammy Davis Junior and Dean Martin. Greenie Farrah Fawcett and proctologist Jack Elam also add to the mayhem.Hal Needham doesn't have to do a lot of work with Brock Yates' script as it allows the players to go for broke and make the most of the comedy. A warning though that 'The Cannonball Run' is an inherently silly show that is not recommended for all audiences.Saturday, January 11, 1997 - Video",6,0,1,30 May 2008
Platoon," Must see anti-war film!
","From arguably the best director of our generation (definitely the most confronting and controversial) came the most disturbing and harrowing war film of all time.'Platoon' tells the story of raw recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who volunteers for service in the Vietnam war only to discover that he has committed himself to a year of pure hell, which he so aptly describes as 'the impossibility of reason'. Stone uses Taylor's shocking story (one many veterans could recount I'm sure) to show us the terrible horrors of war, and does so with gut wrenching effectiveness. The slaying, the brutality, the senseless destruction of both land and people's lives, along with man's shameless inhumanity to man are all painstakingly recreated by Oliver Stone (writer-director), who drives his strong message home relentlessly.All the players are outstanding, with Charlie Sheen passionately portraying the young, confused and scared Taylor, Willem Dafoe marvelously encapsulating the tireless, freedom fighting Sergeant Elias and Tom Berenger coldly bringing to life the heartless Sergeant Barnes. Great support is also given by Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon, Francesco Quinn and even Johnny Depp, among others.Oliver Stone thoroughly deserved his best director Oscar for this riveting and heart rending motion picture, which also deservedly won best picture. Due credit also must go to the technical teams editing, sound editing and art/set design as well as cinematography and the fine choice of music, with Samuel Barber's Adagio for strings being most effective.Very disturbing and aggravating, 'Platoon' is a must see!Wednesday, January 26, 1994 - VideoOliver Stone is the man behind this devastating drama about the horrors of the Vietnam war, as seen through the eyes of raw recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen).Writer-director Stone gives a powerful tour-de-force of Taylor's tour of duty, full as it is with harrowing real life experiences and atrocities, which are presented to us in a shocking and affronting manner.Every single performance here is outstanding. Charlie Sheen's strong interpretation of young Chris Taylor's personal metamorphosis is fantastic, Tom Berenger's harsh portrayal of black hearted Sergeant Barnes is frighteningly effective and Willem Dafoe's superb showing as the compassionate and world weary Sergeant Elias is inspired. Fine turns also from Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley and Johnny Depp.Excellent editing from Claire Simpson, cinematography by Robert Richardson and art direction/set decoration (Bruno Rubeo) round off this most horrific of war films, which makes brilliant use of Samuel Barber's tragic Adagio for Strings to set the heavy mood.Without question the most focused and forceful, not to mention the absolute best, film about war ever made, and certainly one of the strongest dramas to emerge from the 80's.Sunday, October 2, 1994 - Video",8,0,1,19 December 2007
Scream," Ingenious, manipulative thriller
","From possibly the master of horror for this generation comes the ingenious, manipulative thriller, 'Scream'. An apt name for the best horror movie I have ever seen. This is actually the first Wes Craven movie I have really enjoyed. The 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series did nothing for me, though perhaps that was because they took themselves too seriously. Craven not only scares us to death in 'Scream', he sends himself and other horror films up brilliantly. Maybe a horror film cannot succeed without some comic element or a degree of self-parody. It's a theory.The cast do a great job as they work with Craven to tease us through this clever tale. Neve Campbell is the ideal victim, and Skeet Ulrich the perfect brooding boyfriend who is one of the early suspects, much to his chagrin. Courtney Cox plays the scheming journo super-bitch, and others such as Henry Winkler and Drew Barrymore drop by to add flavour to the proceedings.All credit though to Craven, who has reached the pinnacle of his genre with this effort. Having said that, many purists would probably claim that 'Scream' is more thriller and less horror, and I would be the first to agree. But what of it, it's still a great flick.Saturday, July 18, 1998 - VideoOne of the most clever and original horrors ever made.

Carrie," Hammy Horror
","Stephen King's early novel about the telekinetic Carrie White would I'm sure have been a most eerie, spine-tingling tale about an outcast young girl who found she had the ability to move things purely by the power of her will. In the hands of Brian De Palma (ever the inconsistent director, with as many hits as flops to his credit) it comes out as rather an unscary, hammy horror that will struggle to frighten anybody over the age of fifteen (or even twelve).Some scenes, which would have been chillingly effective in King's novel, are certainly well handled by De Palma (such as the 'discovery of the plot' scene), while others are completely hopeless, including the ridiculous finale which totally ruins the whole film and any mood that De Palma had managed to set.As ugly duckling Carrie White, Sissy Spacek does a splendid job, in a role she seemed to be born for. Both Sissy and Piper Laurie garnered Oscar nominations, the latter for a most effective performance as Carrie's disturbed and obsessive mother. Amy Irving, as the girl with a conscience, and Nancy Allen, as the girl with no conscience, both give convincing turns, while Betty Buckley is strong as the vigilante gym teacher who attempts to help and befriend Carrie. John Travolta's meat-head boyfriend gets nothing to do, while William Katt just smiles and looks cute with his blonde curls and dimples (he had to wait for 'The Greatest American Hero' to rescue him from roles such as this). In fact, all the plum roles and strong acting belong to the girls in this one.Thursday, July 13, 1995 - Video",5,1,8,17 February 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Could be the best thriller ever!
","This film would have to be the most suspenseful drama in years, right up there with 'Fatal Attraction', and in the best Hitchcockian tradition. The tantalisation of scares that are not quite delivered, and the ones that are keep you on the edge of your seat from scene one. Jonathan Demme knows exactly when to use subtlety, and does it superbly. 'Lambs' continually intrigues, shocks, disturbs and fascinates, and the subtle humour works well in a dark fashion.Jodie Foster deserves an Oscar for her frantic, tense performance as an FBI trainee searching desperately for a serial killer. Even more deserving is Anthony Hopkins, who is disturbingly charming and chilling as Doctor Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter, who trades with agent Starling (Foster) for 'information'. All supporting cast are excellent in a film that delivers a knockout punch.

Tombstone," Flat Western Fails to Fill Boots
","Based upon the legend of Wyatt Earp, feared and respected law man, and the gunfight at the OK Corral, George P. Cosmatos' ('Rambo II') film never fills the boots it attempts to.The script has failed to inject any interest in the life and times of the Earp boys as they ride into Tombstone and turn it upside down, chasing away all the nasty cowboys. The only character we really end up interested in is Doc Holliday, humorously played by Val Kilmer in what is one of his best roles. Others just don't inspire, such as Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, Billy Zane and Powers Boothe, or they don't sit right, like Bill Paxton as the younger Earp or Michael Biehn, who tries hard as Johnny Ringo, but doesn't quite pull off the tortured, lethal gunman.Most of the gunfights, including the big one, are well staged, but little else is left to help recommend what is otherwise a fairly flat western. Kilmer and the film's good looks keep it above water. Charlton Heston provides a cameo.

His performance is strong, as are they of Sean Young, Darryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer as 'Roy'. It is the look of the film that wins us however, with the superlative Art Direction/Set Decoration bringing the year 2019 convincingly to life.

Ben-Hur," Epic of epics
","The epic of epics, 'Ben-Hur' is quite a treat at the cinema (especially the Astor with its new super-screen and Dolby Digital Sound). In three hours 'Ben-Hur' only lapses a couple of times into rather wishy-washy melodrama. Otherwise director William Wyler has presented a forceful, strikingly visual film about a Jewish man's quest for vengeance, and the way in which he gains that recompense.'Ben-Hur' opens by telling us it is a 'tale of the Christ'. Misleading really, considering only a handful of references are made to Jesus. Why the story of our Lord was tied in is a mystery, and seemingly not necessary. Perhaps Karl Turnberg (screenwriter) was trying hard to be true to the original novel. Certainly the focus is not on forgiveness, though love having the power to set you free and love being stronger than hate are central themes.As I have said, the film looks awesome. The enormous sets are lavish, contributing to an overall production design that is second to none. Cinematography goes one better, with several knockout scenes culminating in the legendary chariot race, which lives up to its billing as the most spectacular chase of all time.The cast are strong too, with the forceful presence of Charlton Heston a big factor. Support from Stephen Boyd (as Messala) and Jack Hawkins (as adoptive father Quitus Arrius) is good too. An excitable turn from an Arabian horse owner is a special highlight.Definitely the stuff of which legends are made. Eleven academy awards speak for themselves (a record only equalled thirty-eight years later by 'Titanic').Sunday, May 3, 1998 - Astor TheatreBigger than big, 'Ben Hur' is the sort of film one must see on the big screen (Melbourne's Astor Theatre comes highly recommended). Viewing this epic on video means losing out on the grand scale of the production. The enormous sets, the costumes, the larger than life characters, and that chariot race. 'Ben Hur' may be the greatest film of all time (open to debate), but whatever the case may be, it must be seen at the movies.Thursday, April 29, 1999 - Video",8,2,5,29 August 2008
Trainspotting," In your face cinema
","Amazingly in your face cinema from director Danny Boyle and writer John Hodge. Adapted form Irvine Welsh's novel, this is the story of four desperate heroine addicts who chose hard drugs rather than life. Instead of the drudgery of the every day, they prefer the ecstatic rush of the heroine hit.Audiences will have to ride through the early scenes that may put you off public toilets (among other things) for life. If you are even the least bit queasy, then 'Trainspotting' is one film you should avoid. Containing much 'toilet' humour and graphic drug use scenes, this is not cinema for the faint hearted.Once you've adapted to Boyle's full on style (which contains some violence too), then you can really start to appreciate the sharp, incisive script from John Hodge, with its clever, biting humour which forces you to laugh at a way of life that is as close to rock bottom as you can get. Boyle and Hodge have given their film a unique Scottish feel, and the culture and psyche of Edinburgh's down and out comes through brilliantly.Of course there is the question of whether this flick glorifies drug addiction. Some aspects of the abuse of heroine are conveyed as a fantastic rush and a great escape, generally though the addicts are shown to be no-hopers headed for nothing but death and destruction.The other immensely enjoyable aspect of 'Trainspotting' is the fantastic cast. Ewan McGregor heads up the young thesps as 'Mark Renton', the central figure in the story and the only guy we really hold out any hope for. Backing him up is Ewen Bremner as 'Spud', the nervous young lad whose fetish for 'speed' makes him very excitable. Jonny Lee Miller is 'Sick Boy', another rather twisted individual whom we find has a heart beneath his deceptive, tough exterior. But the real psycho is Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a guy who wouldn't touch hard drugs and believes that those who use them are soft in the head. His violent temper and passion for brawling make him a distinctly unlikeable chap. Then there's Tommy (Kevin McKidd), straight guy and fitness freak who enjoys taping erotic encounters with long term love Liz. Finally there is young Diane, a feisty femme who proves a handful, and a surprise, for young Renton. All performances from this collective band are strong, with McGregor the shining beacon at the top.Brian Tufano delivers some confronting cinematography, Masahiro Hirakubo supplies the sharp editing and the soundtrack contains a fresh collection of trendy tunes.Tuesday, July 2, 1996 - Hoyts Cinema Centre MelbourneSeeing Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' for a second time really helps clarify what the movie is about, and that is what a dreadful life one can have if one chooses a drug of addiction such as heroin. On the other hand, if one chooses life, it can be a very intoxicating drug, as young Renton finally discovers.Standouts are still Boyle's in your face direction which leaves no aspect of the destitution of drug abuse untouched, and the performances from Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Caarlyle and Kelly McDonald which bring to life the vivid characters who live this sorry existence.A groovy soundtrack accompanies Boyle's innovative film.Monday, April 7, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon",7,7,8,25 March 2008

Speed," Bus Loads of Fun!
","If you're not averse to formula film making, a little bit of overkill, and if you're able to indulge a small amount of un-believability, then you're sure to enjoy 'Speed'.There's thrills and spills aplenty in this action flick about a disturbed bomb freak who plants one of his lethal devices on an LA public bus which is loaded with passengers and roaring down the freeway. Enter police officer Jack Traven, a bomb squad hot shot who has once before thwarted this homicidal madman. Now Jack (Keanu Reeves) must find a way of boarding the moving vehicle in order to warn the civilians and save the day.Reeves stars in a role rumoured to be originally turned down by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and thank goodness for that. Keanu provides a fresh face and a degree of believability as the human hero (ala 'Die Hard') that Schwarzenegger would have ruined. Supporting him are plenty of other enjoyable fresh faces including Sandra Bullock, partner Jeff Daniels and veteran actor Dennis Hopper who is most satisfying as the explosives nut case.Of course the main attraction is the fabulous action, death defying stunts and the thrilling suspense of the whole ordeal. While we know perfectly well that our hero will be triumphant in the end, trying to figure out how he'll squeeze through each tight spot is great fun. Cinematographer come debut director Jan De Bont adds his visual expertise to the production, and it certainly shows with some fantastic camera work ( Director of Photography Andrzej Bartkowiak). It's all rounded off with a suitable soundtrack.'Speed' is never a new journey in the cinema experience, but it doesn't pretend to be. Rather it is pure entertainment - and sweaty palms - all the way to its over the top finale.

Either way, I guess you'll see it to find out what all the fuss is about.Haley Joel Osment is fantastic as the little boy whose sixth sense haunts him and singles him out as a freak. Willis, in his best role since 'Pulp Ficton', is ideal as the troubled psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who tries to help young Cole and exorcise his own demons at the same time. In support is Olivia Williams, strong as Crowe's distant wife, and the amazingly talented Toni Collette; who does a marvellous job as Cole's distraught mom - even her subtle accent is precise.Much more could be added; suffice to say all credit to Mr. Shyamalan's finely tuned screenplay and his astute direction.

Soon he begins to suspect one of his neighbours of foul play when the man's wife suddenly disappears and unexplainable things begin to happen. Both his girlfriend and his nurse think he's paranoid at first, but before long they too believe that something is truly amiss.'Rear Window' never becomes one of the master's all time classics, although some would argue that all of his works are worthy of that term.

The Truman Show," It's all about you
","Peter Weir's film, 'The Truman Show', definitely lacks no innovation, bringing us as it does the unique story of a man who is the central character in an amazingly long-running television show that is all about him. Only catch is, he doesn't know it.We have probably all felt that our lives were on show at one time or another, or even imagined that we were the centre of some great movie. I must admit to imagining myself in a situation just like Truman's. I never expected it to become the subject matter of a movie though. It is probably no wonder that Aussie director Weir jumped at it.Weir does a pretty good job creating the world in which Truman Burbank lives (maybe a reference to Burbank studios in that name), giving us a pseudo-reality of which we are completely aware, but of which Truman has no concept. Weir's problems start when he has to decide where to take this ground-breaking film. Like Peter Howitt's 'Sliding Doors', it is very difficult to know how to close a movie whose very concept is capable of totally wowing its audience. Many may be disappointed with this film's finale, and some may even feel cheated out of a true ending. Others will cheer; it's all down to personal taste.Jim Carrey, upon whom the entire show rides, impresses often as the bright, cheery insurance salesman who starts to believe there may be something very wrong with his world. He certainly has the right amount of charisma, though whether his dramatic prowess was strong enough is debatable. Perhaps a classic actor would have done something completely different with this role. Support cast are merely incidental, but include Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris, Hollard Taylor and Natascha McElhone.Highly effective music comes from original composer Burkhard Dallwitz with additional pieces from Philip Glass.

Casino," Goodfellas rehash
","Enough rehash already! Although not a remake in the traditional sense, 'Casino' is a virtual re-presentation of Martin Scorcese's '91 smash 'Goodfellas'. Now that was a great gangster film. Graphically violent, self absorbed, bitingly funny, brooding and epically proportioned, it was a knockout. Not so 'Casino'.This is a real exercise in excess, and one that completely backfires on Scorcese and his team. The film is terribly overlong at three hours, and many will struggle to pay attention the entire time, especially given the narrative which has leads De Niro, Pesci and others talking us through the whole show, another big miscalculation.The movie is far too violent, being often hard to stomach rather than effectively portraying the characters and their personalities and motivations. It's just one long, drawn out gangster show set in Las Vegas that is spotted with bursts of gruesome violence. In short, Scorcese and co-writer Pileggi have used exactly the same formula that they employed in adapting the latter's first book 'Wise Guys' ('Goodfellas') to the screen, which made that film a sensation, and this one a mindless bore.Performances are strong, especially Sharon Stone as the hopeless drug fiend Ginger whose love of money proves her undoing. She is well deserving of the Oscar nomination that has come her way. De Niro and Joe Pesci, though impressive, are really only reprising their original 'Goodfellas' turns. De Niro's Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway is very similar to his Sam Rothstein, the Jewish gambling icon who ran 'The Tangiers' for the mob. And Pesci's Nicky Santoro, the ultra-violent, crazy mob guy assigned to look after Rothstein, is a dead ringer for Tommy De Vito, his violent, paranoid persona from 'Goodfellas'. Other support players make the most of their limited roles.Definitely under edited, tale could have been told in less than two hours, but Scorcese had to over indulge didn't he. Robert Richardson's camera work is impressive, though even he seems to be trying too hard. Perhaps that's just the whole feel of the movie. An over-rated, over the top, over inflated waste. Art and sets are incredibly lavish, while the costumes are wild but spot on. PS I bet Pileggi's book is great reading.Sunday, March 24, 1996 - Knox District Centre",3,12,26,18 March 2008
Heat," Mouth-watering action
","De Niro and Pacino together is enough to make your mouth water isn't it? Well it is mine. Michael Mann has done an excellent job with this stellar cast, bringing what is essentially a thinking man's action film to the screen.De Niro and Pacino are awesome, one as the pro-thief who coldly moves within his world of organised hits and planned jobs, and the other as the world weary cop who is on the edge yet cannot give up doing the only thing he knows. For these two alone the film is worth it. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore also put in strongly as De Niro's associates, as does Jon Voight. The girls, sadly second to the boys in a film such as this, do well too. Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman and Natalie Portman lead the way.The only thing that knocks this flick down a peg or two is its over-length; and that by only fifteen to twenty minutes. Michael Mann (director) dwells a little too long on a couple of scenes toward the end when his audience is itching for the climax. Our writer-director really built the tension too well. Features a great score from Elliot Goldenthal.Sunday, January 2, 2000 - Video",7,0,1,17 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Wonderfully entertaining spectacle, an adventure for all ages
","The science-fiction film of all time has to be 'Star Wars'. This epic space adventure continues to dazzle audiences even after sixteen years.The cast (including Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing) do a marvellous job amongst all the machinery and technical wizardry of George Lucas. Yet it probably has to be said that they are not only outshone by the technical special effects (still eye-popping even now) but also by the very funny antics of droids C-3PO and R2D2, who really steal the show.Its a movie that has something for everyone, including romance, adventure, action, chivalry and good versus evil. A great spectacle for the kids, and a marvellous adventure for all us adults. Wonderfully entertaining.Thursday, July 22, 1993 - Astor TheatreThe landmark sci-fi movie of all time, 'Star Wars', remains the most amazing journey into the imagination of writer-director George Lucas.It's visual splendour and special effects genius still has a marked impact almost two decades on, as does the old fashioned story of home grown heroes up against dastardly villains in its dazzling futuristic setting.Sir Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford almost match the show stealing turns from C-3PO and R2D2, but not quite. While finally, John Williams magnificent score is a treat. A real must for the young at heart.Saturday, February 19, 1994 - VideoTwenty years on and the 'Star Wars' trilogy is back, bigger and, some say, better than ever. For mine I'm not so sure. I have two schools of thought about 'Star Wars' at the movies.a.) If you've already experienced the big screen adventure of the rebellion as they unite against Lord Vader's evil Galactic Empire and his awesome Death Star, then the new 'Special Edition' may not have a great deal to offer you. Yes, Lucas and his whiz-bang team at I.L.M. have touched up the whole show, adding some new creatures and effects - most notably Han Solo's scene with Jabba the Hut - as well as digitally re-mastering the soundtrack. But often I got the feeling old George may have just been a little carried away, and sometimes he seems to be trying too hard to impress us. However, I guess if I was given the opportunity to digitally enhance my favourite baby after twenty years, I would be inclined to let things get out of hand too. Perhaps it's just me though, griping about changes to the original, even if very few things have changed. In short, if you've seen 'Star Wars' at the flicks before, then you'll only be seeing it again. But I reckon that's a good enough reason.b.) If you've never seen 'Star Wars', or only viewed it on video, then I would definitely recommend you go out right now, find a huge, loud, packed cinema and experience for yourself the groundbreaking science-fiction film which has been infinitely duplicated and whose special effects have only been surpassed in recent years by 'T2' and 'Jurassic Park'.Sure there are some awful lines - the whole movie is targeted at kids folks (they'll love R2D2 and C3PO and so will you) - but for pure adventure, heroism and good versus evil, you can't go past 'Star Wars'.Saturday, April 5, 1997 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne",6,1,5,26 November 2007
Apollo 13," An exciting time
","Boys own adventure about the ill fated 'Apollo 13' mission which was to follow the successful journey that saw Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the moon.Ron Howard deftly recreates the tension, ambition, hope and disappointment which accompanied the crew who dreamed of writing yet another page in 'space race' history. Ronnie helms with a purpose, never allowing any sidelines or subplots to undermine the story which he skilfully builds to not one, but several nail biting climaxes. Many of us know the story, yet writers John Sayles, William Broyles Jnr. and Al Reinart still manage to entertain us with an involving screenplay which recreates the excitement of the time.All the technical teams have masterfully brought to life the NASA Space Centre at Cape Kennedy, along with the amazing hardware that goes with it. The take-off sequence is especially well produced thanks to some stunning special effects and clever cinematography (Dean Cundey - who wields with effect throughout the pic).Tom Hanks convincingly personifies the ambitious dreamer Jim Lovell, sharing with us his trials and his triumphs. In support of him is Bill Paxton (in perhaps his biggest role to date), finally playing a character who is not paranoid, and doing so very well. Kevin Bacon also joins the crew, playing a late replacement for the devastated Gary Sinise, who is ousted due to concerns he may contract the measles. Back at Cape Kennedy, an impressive Ed Harris calls the shots in an Academy nominated role, keeping his feet firmly on the ground, unlike his turn in 'The Right Stuff'.James Horner provides a familiar sounding theme.Friday, October 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",7,1,2,27 February 2008
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Will stay with you and haunt you
","Visual splendour and strong acting dominate this meandering, self indulgent epic of the life of one very miserable vampire.Neil Jordan ('The Crying Game') has filmed Ann Rice's epic novel with distinctly dark overtones both visually and comically in order to enhance the evil mood, yet the homosexuality of some characters, clearly prevalent in the book, is barely hinted at here. Word is Tom Cruise was unhappy with such connotations, but no-one really knows why the references were omitted. This leaves us with something less than Rice's fascinating tale which many have called a literary classic of its genre, yet Jordan and Rice (who adapted her original story for the screen) still deliver a disturbing and tragic film about one man's shattered dream of immortality and his struggle to come to terms with what he is.Cruise justifies the rave reviews he's been receiving (who better than Ann Rice to blow his trumpet after publicly canning him when he was cast) for his portrayal of the malevolently evil LeStat, a vampire who has no qualms about his disposition and eccentric taste. In fact he rather enjoys the sport of luring his next victim for a feed, aristocratic or Creole preferably. His chosen companion is Louis, a broken man after the loss of his wife and child, he desperately yearns for a way out, and so recklessly takes LeStat up on his offer of a new life with no pain or suffering. Brad Pitt manages to outshine Mr. Cruise in a superb showing as a vampire so guilt ridden about his blood lust that he cannot bear to face another night of horror. So downcast is he that LeStat believes they may benefit from adopting a new companion and so young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst in a wickedly excellent performance) becomes a sort of surrogate daughter with a 'hunger' to match that of her 'maker'.Adding to the devilish goings on are European vampires Armand (Antonio Banderas), a lonely but heartless leader, and Santiago (Stephen Rea), a ruthless henchman. Christian Slater also drops by as the interviewer, a role originally slated for River Phoenix who sadly passed away before filming could be completed. His untimely death (at only 23) shocked legions of fans who had toted him as the next James Dean, perhaps an all too accurate assessment of a very talented young actor. Slater assumes the part admirably, and he donated his salary to some of River's favourite charities in honour of his memory.A warning then for the faint hearted or those of you who are easily spooked. Although 'The Vampire Chronicles' is not a thriller that will have you hitting the roof every three minutes, it is most definitely unnerving, so those prone to nightmares are well advised to stay away. Stan Winston's make-up and special f/x are all convincing enough to give you the shivers, and there's little left to the imagination.Jordan successfully stops things from becoming gratuitous however, and though 'Vampire' is at times self-interested and perhaps overlong, he has once again triumphed with a picture that won't surprise you quite as much as 'The Crying Game', but it certainly will haunt you with images and characters that will stay with you long after you've left the theatre.Monday, January 2, 1995 - Village Centre Melbourne",7,2,3,31 January 2008
Jackie Brown," Overlong, stretched, too much
","From popular director Tarantino comes this overlong adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch'. It appears Tarantino has attempted to make the film as clever and as in-depth as the original material. Yet in trying to include so much, he has stretched this pic too far.Far too much time is spent on characterisation (probably the entire first hour). The plot therefore, is neglected until it is too late for Tarantino to gain our interest. By the time he starts compiling the narrative, we have tuned out. Our director was too hung up on his amazing characters and what they had to say (a Tarantino weakness which served him well in 'Pulp Fiction'), and his introductions went on too long.Tarantino fave Samuel L. Jackson is his usual enigmatic self, but is in serious danger of being typecast. Richard Forster's subtle performance is far more effective, and Pam Grier is solid. Good support from Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda.The funky soundtrack helped, but Tarantino's over indulgence did not. Could have been more impacting with twenty minutes cut out and more focus on the plot.Saturday, March 6, 1999 - Video",5,5,8,29 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of three?
","Episode V in the 'Star Wars' trilogy will always be remembered as the film that introduced a serious plot line to proceedings. After the rebels' success in Episode IV, the Empire chased them throughout the galaxy, finally confronting them on the ice world of Hoth. The group escapes and Luke goes to train as a Jedi under Yoda. Lando Calrissian betrays them to Lord Vader, and the evil master of the dark side has a startling revelation for Luke. Captain Solo is sold to Boba Fett who takes him to Jabba the Hutt. All of this leaves us hanging for Episode VI. Though thick on storyline, and revered by critics, it was probably the least entertaining for the kiddies with its meandering middle and sparse action. The AT-AT Imperial Walkers and the Millennium Falcon's flight through the asteroid field are the definite highlights.Again the technical wizardry of Lucas team shines, with the digitally improved sound and visual effects being a must. Stop-motion animation, used during the 'Walker' scenes, is particularly impressive. John Wiliams has again provided a masterful score.In truth all 'The Empire Strikes Back' really does is provide the link between the first and final battles involving the alliance and the Empire, but it does so admirably, and it must be said that the second of the three 'Star Wars' films is probably the best.Saturday, April 27, 1997 - Hoyts Cinema Centre",7,0,3,6 June 2008
Aladdin," Disney continue to outdo themselves
","At the time this was probably Disney's most commercially successful production, that is until 'The Lion King' eclipsed all expectations and smashed video sales records. But really the great movie mogul has outdone itself again and again in recent years, ever since 'The Little Mermaid' appeared on our screens in 1989. Following that was the Academy Award Best Picture nominee 'Beauty and the Beast', and then this comedy smash.The entire success of this film is owed to the comic genius of Robin Williams, whose 'performance' is a riot of ad-libbing, satire and slapstick. Williams makes the 'Genie of the Lamp' all his own, delivering one of his very best comic turns. And of course in animation, the sky's the limit as to what his character is able to do. In this vain scripters Ron Clements, John Musker, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have let their collective imaginations run wild, and the cartoonists have matched them on the screen, unleashing some hilarious caricatures and send-ups each for which chameleon Williams has the voice.All other aspects, though of high quality, are merely incidental, with the exception perhaps of the enjoyable score from Alan Menken, and rousing musical numbers from Menken, Howard Ashman and Tim Rice. They included the smash hit 'A Whole New World' and 'Never Had a Friend Like Me', a lively number delivered with panache by Williams.H. Lee Peterson is the astute editor, while other voices belong to Scott Weinger ('Aladdin'), Linda Larkin ('Princess'), Jonathan Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried, Frank Welker and Douglas Seale.Friday, March 1, 1996 - VideoHighly entertaining Disney animated flick about the mythical Aladdin and the Genie of the Lamp. The entire film belongs to the enigmatic, charismatic Robin Williams whose characterisation of the all powerful Genie is an hilarious delight. His ad-libbing style of comic mayhem is a riot, as Williams easily personifies multiple personalities with the help of some clever animation. Scott Weinger provides the voice of Aladdin, with Jonathan Freeman wonderfully evil as 'Jafar'.The script has a delicious sense of humour, providing a plot that will entertain children and adults alike. The entire show is presided over astutely by Ron Clements and John Musker.The other big highlight is the music from Howard Ashman, Alan Menken and Tim Rice. There's the hit song 'A Whole New World' as well as catchy tunes like 'You Ain't Never Had a Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali'.A most enjoyable pic from Disney, even on re-runs.Saturday, March 22, 1997 - Video",7,0,1,14 March 2008
Braveheart," Blood stirring, passionate film
","Gibson's '95 block buster garnered five Academy Awards (from ten nominations) including best film, best director and best cinematography. I must agree that John Toll wields his camera with devastating effect, capturing some majestic Scottish countryside and breathing life (and much death) into some spectacularly choreographed battle scenes. However the other two awards I really find myself questioning.Don't get me wrong here, 'Braveheart' is a worthy piece of entertainment of epic proportions, but proportions aren't everything. Technically the film is near flawless, with Toll's superb camera work backed up by artistic and very realistic makeup, fantastic sound and sound effects (makeup and sound effects won Oscars), top notch editing, striking costumes, convincing art and another strong, inspiring score form military soundtrack master James Horner ('Aliens', 'Glory' and 'Apollo 13').Gibson does direct with a purpose, setting out to make an epic, he gets almost everything right. Randall Wallace (any relation to the great William?) provides a sound screenplay, which seems to be quite historically accurate, even if it may take creative licence in the more private affairs of the mighty William Wallace. What screenwriter Randall does not do is allow us to really get into the head of the fearsome Scot, leaving us with only suggestions as to what motivated him. Lack of character depth, and therefore appreciation, can probably also be attributed to the absence of outstanding acting, which is the real reason 'Braveheart' falls short of its enormous potential. A couple of knockout performances would have made this film an indelible memory, but alas none of the strong support cast (including Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, Brenda Gleeson, Angus McFadyen, James Cosmo, David O'Hara, Peter Henly, James Robinson, Alun Armstrong and Ian Bannen) were able to turn in anything more than a 'thoroughly enjoyable'. And honestly, though we all love Mel with a passion, he's no' William Wallace, now is he? Gibson is always a pleasure on screen, and he does a good job with the accent, but I for one was never really convinced that this was the man who freed Scotland form the tyranny of English rule.Having said all that, I would not hesitate to recommend 'Braveheart' to all audiences who crave a blood stirring, passionate film, especially those who, like myself, have Scottish heritage. Do try and catch this at a repertory theatre. Not for the squeamish!Monday, July 15, 1996 - Video",7,1,15,26 March 2008
True Romance," Never a dull moment
","Though from Tony Scott ('Beverly Hills Cop II' and 'Days of Thunder'), 'True Romance' reeks of writer Quentin Tarantino. More glitzy and highly charged than most of Tarantino's work, it is still peopled with characters typical of his films - lowlifes and strange gangsters - and is full of clever, sharp and insightfully humorous dialogue.Perhaps the romantic element is misplaced, and the Elvis factor may not be entirely effective, but certainly each encounter the Morley's have with their pursuers, and that the pursuers have with others, is enjoyable and action packed, even occasionally gruesome.Had he directed, Quentin would probably have turned this into a real philosophical trip, ala 'Pulp Fiction', yet director Tony Scott has gone all out for the shoot 'em up style, delivering romping entertainment while neglecting the deeper probings of Q.T.'s script. This is not to say that Mr. Scott has let us down, but if you don't like full on, in your face action flicks, you'd better forget about this one.All the cast, quite an ensemble, have a great time, especially the walk-ons. Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken are most enjoyable. Leads Christian Slater and the sexy Patricia Arquette hold up very well. Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Saul Rubinek and Val Kilmer also drop in on proceedings.Hans Zimmer's music works reasonably well, cinematography is exciting and gunplay action sequences are nerve racking. Editing keeps things well paced. Never a dull moment.Friday, February 23, 1996 - Astor TheatreTony Scott's boisterous, high energy action flick, which is peopled with characters and dialogue typical of Quentin Tarantino (the writer), is highly recommended to those who enjoy their movies loud, fast and with loads of gunplay.While Scott keeps the action coming thick and fast, Tarantino maintains a steady supply of lowlifes to keep us equally entertained. Leads Slater and Arquette do fine, but it is the support cast that grab our attention. Gary Oldman is totally absorbed in his character as always, playing a white pimp whose psychosis has him convinced he's anything but white. Just as entertaining are Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, and the scene played between them is a particular highlight. Joining the fun also are Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Chris Penn, Saul Rubinek and Samuel L.

The Breakfast Club," Very enjoyable, observant teen flick
","For all the critical flack John Hughes has received for his many teen films which have raked in the dollars, he showed us in 'The Breakfast Club' that he has a certain understanding of modern day youth.Writer-director Hughes gives us an incisive look at five young students who spend a Saturday detention together in their school library. Complete strangers when the day begins, they gradually open up and form an unlikely but strong bond by the day's end.Hughes' well written and passionate characters are convincingly given voice by the impressive young cast. Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez are particularly sharp, while Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall both lend decent support.The main message of the film, to take our youth more seriously and give them an even break, is well handled by Hughes as each very different teenager is portrayed as a real human being with feelings and attitudes relative to their own situations. Hughes covers each topic of adolescence well, and with due seriousness, while still keeping the humour rolling and maintaining the very strong 'teen' feel about the whole thing.Unfortunately the love tie-ins and romantic ending are a little too soft and probably unnecessary too, but that and Paul Gleeson's 'teacher with an attitude' character are the only disappointments in a very enjoyable, semi-cult teen film.Backed up by a great rock soundtrack penned for the movie by Keith Forsey.Monday, January 17, 1994 - T.V.",6,1,2,17 December 2007
Contact," Intriguing but contrived
","Intriguing, well-constructed sci-fi that unfortunately falls flat when it comes to providing a conclusion. Again the prevalent problem with great ideas is how to finish them. Zemeckis appears full of inspiration when it comes to innovative film making, yet he couldn't round this one out.Based upon the novel by Carl Sagan, this pic tells the story of a young astronomer who is determined to prove the existence of intelligent life forms on other planets. Jodie Foster is compelling as always, and is well supported by Tom Skerritt, David Morse, Matthew McConaughey and John Hurt. Special Effects are excellent, and Alan Silvestri's music serves well.A shame then about the contrived ending.Saturday, May 13, 2000 - DVD",6,2,4,4 August 2010
Born on the Fourth of July," Infuriating and moving
","While not connected in any actual way, 'Born on the Fourth of July' is Oliver Stone's follow up to his fantastic 1986 film about the Vietnam war, 'Platoon'. This time Stone confronts us with the shocking affect the war had on its veterans, by telling us the true story of Ron Kovic, a young man who joined the marines in order to get an opportunity to serve his country in the war, and stop the 'insipid communist' regime.Oliver Stone, who again won best director at the Academy Awards for this film, delivers yet another powerful and emotional drama about the atrocities of Vietnam, atrocities that even followed the young men back to the United States. Once again the production is technically impressive and very convincing, and John Williams provides a truly haunting score, which is both disturbing and uplifting in its own right. The fabulous acting performances are probably the films strongest point, with Raymond J. Barry, Frank Whalley, Jerry Levine and both Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger (also in 'Platoon') lending fine back up to Tom Cruise, whose honest and passionate portrayal of the shattered Kovic is magnificent, the role of a lifetime for this previously unproven actor.Stone's movie of Ron Kovic's novel is only fractionally less effective than 'Platoon', perhaps due to its marginal over length and the fact that it is not as brilliantly focused as its predecessor, as it covers a much broader range of topics that related to the war. Yet still this is a film that will surely infuriate you, and move you.Wednesday, January 26, 1994 - VideoOliver Stone's obsession with the Vietnam war continues in 'Born on the Fourth of July' as he shifts his focus from what Vietnam did to the soldiers to what the United States did to its veterans.Ron Kovic's touching autobiographical novel is the subject matter on which Stone bases his harrowing, disturbing screen play (co-written by Stone and Kovic) about young Kovic's blind pro-war patriotism which turns into a strong anti-war passion after he returns from Vietnam paralysed and disillusioned.The film's strongest point is its performances from an impressive cast including Raymond J. Barry, Caroline Kava, Jerry Levine, Kyra Sedgwick, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger and an outstanding Tom Cruise who gives us a powerhouse showing, first as the gung-ho young marine ready to take on the world, then as the confused and angry vet questioning the very ideals on which he was brought up.The splendid production values that were evident in 'Platoon' return again, with Robert Richardson back behind the camera to deliver some splendid 'Nam pics, Bruno Rubeo again in charge of Art Direction, while new editor David Brenner does a creditable job and John Williams scores an emotionally rousing piece of music.Again Stone proves himself a confronting controversialist, and one who was obviously deeply disturbed himself by the upheaval that so devastated the American people and the entire world in the turbulent 60's. As an accompaniment to 1986's best picture 'Platoon', 'Born on the Fourth of July' is a worthy piece of cinema, and though not as brilliantly or deliberately focused as its powerful predecessor, it is a haunting reminder of one of the greatest tragedies of our too often fallible kind, war!Thursday, October 6, 1994 - Video",8,1,2,19 December 2007
The Wedding Singer," Fun and amiable, not ingenious
","Essentially silly, would be send-up of 1985 (or that era) is fortunately not taken seriously by anyone involved. Not really all that well done as a satire or a romantic comedy, 'The Wedding Singer' does benefit from an amiable cast.I have never been a huge Adam Sandler fan, yet he has gone some way here to winning me over with a goofy, awkward turn as 'The Wedding Singer' whose life is ruined when he is left standing at the altar. Drew Barrymore is 'Julia', the sweet girl-next-door who wins Robbie's heart and gives him something to live for. This is the sort of role Drew is perfect for, and it's a shame we don't see her like this more often. The support cast have been cleverly typecast.The real draw card is the soundtrack, featuring many lost classics from the mid-80's, like '99 Luftballons', 'Der Kommisar' and 'Do You Really Want to Hurt Me'. I would sure love a copy for my CD collection.Again, with almost unlimited opportunities, 'The Wedding Singer' doesn't capitalise nearly enough in poking fun at this decade. It is sure, however, to bring back some great memories for those aged twenty-three to thirty-three.Sunday, May 17, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon",6,5,7,29 August 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The World's Most Fearless Adventurer Returns
","The great adventurer returns! In the third instalment of the escapades of heroic archaeologist Indiana Jones, Steven Spielberg has reverted to the original formula that made the first film, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', such an overwhelming success. And after the Gothic, action bursting 'Temple of Doom', thank goodness he has. Not only has the tongue-in-cheek humour and light-hearted adventure of 'Raiders' resurfaced here, but the plot is again along the same lines. Two years after his 1936 pursuit of the Ark, Doctor Jones once more finds himself pursuing a religious artifact. This time it's the revered Cup of Christ, better known as the Holy Grail. No prizes for guessing that the Nazis are of course his nemesis, lead naturally by a megalomaniac non-German whose only goal is self-glorification.Okay, perhaps this new story from George Lucas and Menno Meyjes may not be incredibly innovative nor original, but their dialogue is truly incisive and comically effective, especially in the lively exchanges between Indy and his new sidekick.Harrison Ford is joined in his adventures this time by Sean Connery, who plays his rather uninitiated father, professor Henry Jones. These two old hands of the cinema (Ford a veteran of twenty years, Connery of thirty) provide much of the entertainment that is offered throughout the movie, engaging in some hilarious by-play and a few very memorable scenes. They develop a rapport that will have you totally convinced that they are blood related, such is the chemistry they create.Sean Connery manages not only to create a wonderful new cinematic character, but also seems to have a great deal of fun almost sending up his 'James Bond' image, playing the inept older partner to Ford's world weary hero. In an outstanding performance, Connery easily steals the majority of the scenes he's in. Not to under-rate the talents of Harrison Ford though, who (not always outdone by his co-star) is still the star of the show. Perhaps Ford's Indiana Jones is becoming a little too invincible, escaping more hair-raising tight spots that an ordinary 'human' hero has a right to, he's still however fantastic to root for.Support cast are also most enjoyable, especially Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, both welcome returns from 'Raiders'. It is the villains that are the disappointment. Instead of the delicious nasties like the effervescent, charismatic Belloq, and the shifty, evil Toht (both of whom graced 'Raiders'), this instalment presents us with an uninspired obsessive Donovan (Julian Glover), and a one-dimensional Nazi commander. Alison Doody is an attractive femme fatale, though never a match for the feisty Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). River Phoenix drops in as a young Indiana in a segment from 1912 which helps to explain away some of the intrepid archaeologist's secrets and motivations.Always a treat is maestro John Williams score, which introduces some invigorating new themes, as well as a familiar old one that serves as a very clever in-joke. Douglas Slocombe's camera follows the action superbly, and now familiar editor Michael Kahn sets a telling pace.With 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' Spielberg has undeniably cemented the great archaeologist's reputation as the world's most fearless adventurer. Filled with thrills 'n' spills, lethal hit men and deadly booby traps, its a movie all the young at heart should enjoy.Saturday, July 22, 1995 - Video",7,2,3,19 February 2008
Back to the Future," All time favourite
","'Back to the Future' is the most entertaining, fun-filled movie of all time. Not to mention the fact that after first seeing this at the age of fifteen (and going back for more ten times), it remained my very favourite film for years.Absolutely wonderful balance of humour, drama and fantasy that finds teenager Marty McFly accidentally transported back in time to 1955. There he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting, and thus sets off an hilarious chain of events; all of which he must fix before he goes 'Back to the Future'. Fox is perfectly cast as Marty and Lloyd is in outrageously funny form as 'Doc' Emmette Brown. Alan Silvestri's music and the incidental pop soundtrack are very enjoyable. The script from co-writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is pure genius. Special effects are brilliant! Pure entertainment!!Monday, June 10, 1991 - Golden Twin Cinema, BendigoOnce again pure adventure and entertainment. A perfect combination of comedy and fantasy. Filmed well and great fun to watch!Wednesday, January 15, 1992 - Laser DiscI still recall the first time I ever saw this pic. It was September the 14th, 1985, and as an unsuspecting fifteen year old, I went along by chance to see 'Back to the Future' at the Balwyn Cinema (then only a single cinema complex). I was totally blown away, and rushed out to see it again twelve days later, at the old Forum cinema (remember that place?), being bedazzled once more. Several excursions later (including a few to the Australia Twin in Collins St.) and I still couldn't get enough.This was my twelfth trip to the movies to see this blockbuster of 1985. Eleven and a half years on, it is now difficult to fathom what attracted me so inexorably to this highly entertaining, yet hardly classic film. Perhaps Rob Zemeckis and Bob Gale's ingenious story of bewildered teen Marty McFly's journey back in time is finally wearing thin on me. Oh what sacrilege.The fact remains though that this film is, as I've said many times before, pure entertainment. Visual and sound effects during the time traveling sequences are dazzling, art direction and set decoration both brilliantly recreate 1955 (they received an Academy Award nomination) as do costumes. Zemeckis and Gale were also nominated for their script.The pop soundtrack, including Lindsay Buckingham, Eric Carmen and Huey Louis and the News, was instrumental in the film's success, and Alan Silvestri's music is an unsung hero in the proceedings. Finally, the cast are a real delight. Fox is the perfect choice for the fish-out-of-water McFly, and Christopher Lloyd is superb as the nutty Doc Brown. Lea Thompson is suitably smitten as Marty's mom, Lorraine, and Crispin Glover is a scene stealer as the geeky George McFly, whether he is under a ton of make-up - aged forty-seven - or bumbling around as a seventeen year old in 1955. Thomas F. Wilson is fun too as Biff Tannen, the bane of the McFly's existence.One hundred and twelve minutes of absolute fun!Monday, March 31, 1997 - Astor Theatre",8,2,2,29 May 2007
Goodfellas," Scorcese Power Punch
","'Goodfellas' is a very dark, harsh film that actually manages to glorify gangsters. Director Martin Scorcese shows an obsession for the characters and the extraordinary lives they lead. New boy Henry Hill is played well by Ray Liotta, while long-time wise guys Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito are played brilliantly by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci respectively.Scorcese shines throughout as he manages to entertain, and keep the audience interested, for over two hours.Another great, powerful gangster movie. Be aware 'Goodfellas' is a violent film, yet by today's standards, perhaps not so anymore.Sunday, March 3, 1991 - Village Southland",8,0,1,18 April 2007
The Birds," Disturbing 60's suspense
","From the master of suspense came this very different thriller. Extremely different for 1963. Bizarre and disturbing, the story comes from Daphne Du Maurier's novella about a plague of birds that terrorise a seaside resort.Tippi Hedren made her debut as the aloof woman who follows Rod Taylor to his summer retreat on the northern coast of California where all the resident's lives are about to be overturned.Unfortunately while chilling - the film features some great visual and sound effects - the film is entirely plot less. Apart from the nasty birds, nothing else happens. This lack of substance leaves the audience rather empty.There is no denying the great look of the film though, including some sharp cinematography and good art direction.Saturday, April 3, 1999 - Video",6,1,5,8 April 2010
Jurassic Park," Amazing visual splendour
","Who better than Spielberg to bring us a visually spectacular movie about a creature whose species died out several million years ago (65 million in fact), and who has been represented on film many times, but never as realistically as this.An adventure in a class of its own, it tells the story of a dinosaur theme park (made possible by DNA cloning) that goes haywire. The cast (which includes Sir Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum) are very impressive, as is the cinematography and art dir/set decoration. Occasionally akin to 'Aliens' (although not as thrill a minute, adrenalin pumping as the superior actioner), this is the most eye-popping film since 'T-2'.Final word must go to the f/x team who've created an illusion so real you'll be looking for dinosaurs as you leave the theatre. Although sometimes very frightening, 'Jurassic Park' must be seen at the cinema to fully appreciate its visual splendour. Amazing!Wednesday, September 8, 1993 - Balwyn CinemaMichael Crichton's terrifying novel about DNA induced dinosaurs running amok on an island theme park has been translated into a special effects spectacular by wiz-bang director Steven Spielberg.Industrial Light and Magic, along with all the other f/x geniuses on board this project, have really flexed their creative muscles to produce images of such frightening and realistic proportions, that the rest of the somewhat average and occasionally implausible story doesn't really matter.Crichton's characters come off just a little too clichéd, and all the actors are forced to take backstage to the visual splendour, but who cares! Just sit back, suspend disbelief (if you are unable to do this then forget it) and let Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' take you on an exhilarating joy ride of thrills and scares, accompanied by a romping score from maestro John Williams.Cast includes Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sir Richard Attenborough and newcomers Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazello.Friday, September 16, 1994 - Astor Theatre",8,2,4,30 November 2007
Beetlejuice," Fantastic success a real mystery
","A huge box office sensation in the U.S., Tim Burton's 'Beetlejuice' really lacks any entertainment value.Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are a recently married couple who desperately want to 'exorcise' the nasty new tenants in their house. Tricky thing is, the new people are alive, and the newlyweds are dead. The plot premise is original, but sadly uninspiring, while most of the comedy lacks bite. Some of the humour works, and Michael Keaton is sufficiently wacky as the title character, but 'Beetlejuice' offers its audience little more.This film's fantastic success is a real mystery.Saturday, October 30, 1993 - Video",3,3,10,3 December 2007
