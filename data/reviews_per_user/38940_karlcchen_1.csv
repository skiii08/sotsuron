Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Too unreal and predictable, then tried too hard to be funny
","This movie has a good creative idea as a start to become a great comedy. But they tried too hard to be funny, as a result has actually ruined most of it. It is like putting too much sugar in a cake.So many scenes are so unreal and stupid even for a comedy movie. Borate look like a total moron, if they made him smarter, like the one in 'The Gods must be Crazy' it will worked out much better. Since I already know and can expect most of time what he is going to say and do, there are few surprises, thus make it not funny, but simply stupid.It is also the OVERLY unreal stupidity that ruined it, I can watch the original 1963 pink panther twice and still laughing. or the 'Taxi 2' twice and still laughing, but not this movie most of time. Because it is more convincing what a clumsy guy will actually do, you need to over do it a little but not too much. this super idiot is going to say and do, how can it be funny? The later 'Pink Panther' and 'Taxi' sequels also run of laughing ideas similar too this 'Borate' the very first time.Regards, Karl Chen",1,7,14,13 March 2007
