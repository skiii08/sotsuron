","This was the best movie I have seen in a long time. I would pay to go see it again, the entire movie is exciting and real both Reese and Joaquin are brilliant I can't wait to see her get a academy award for this one. The singing they both did was so much like johnny and June unbelievable. I give this movie a big fat 10 for both the writing and the performances. I would advise anyone with the love of music to go see this movie. I took my teenage daughter who also enjoyed this movie. So I would say that this movie is for all ages. If anyone out there doesn't know the true life of johnny cash then go see the movie. I cried, I laughed, And I even danced in my chair to the music. I will being getting the DVD when it comes out, its a movie to put in my library. So I can watch it over and over again.",10,0,1,26 November 2005
