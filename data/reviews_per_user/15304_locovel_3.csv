Black Swan," The use of the word cliché is becoming a cliché
","This is more of a review of the reviews I have read about Black Swan on IMDb. A cliché is often a vivid depiction of an abstraction that relies upon analogy or exaggeration for effect. One could simply say this whole movie was based on this and then say this about any exaggerated or simple story. Black Swan was a cliché: a very pretty and disturbing one.I've read a lot of comments that have compared this movie to pornography. There were no scenes of genitalia, erections, penetration or vulgar dialogue and delivery boys. The sex scene between Portman and Kunis was about a minute and was gratuitous (is gratuity a negative thing??) and could have been longer which would have even more gratified my unnecessary and clichéd sense of entertainment. It wasn't unnecessary. Nina's lack of sexual experience and fragile idealism is contradicted by the sexual aggressiveness and perceived debauchery of her mentors and peers and as a result she tries to expand her experiences as much as she can handle. This, in combination with her own ideals and destructive tendencies, leads to her deterioration.Tchaikovsky wasn't downplayed in this movie. He's dead so anyone that would spend the time to arrange his music, by definition, elevates him or more specifically, his music. I'm educated in music, not in dance but I'll assume the same comment regarding this movie degrading ballet. If you want to uphold the integrity of classical music and ballet then support your local classical and dance ensembles. This isn't a documentary so it is absolutely ridiculous for people to have disdain because the movie didn't show respect towards other forms of entertainment.I now wish she would have actually turned into a Black Swan at the end and really upset viewers who already hated this movie.",8,0,1,15 February 2011
Amadeus," salieri is better than the exorcist
","The best parts of this movie are between Salieri and the priest. The priest is more disturbed at the end of this movie than the priest at the end of the exorcist. If you thought the movie was contrary to the reality of Mozart's life, then it is only your fixed sentimentality's that are being offended. Abraham's character is brilliantly disturbed to the point of genius in this role. Whether or not it went down like this is pointless to the dynamics of the acting in this film. The recessional at the end of the film is one of the best endings I have ever seen. Oh IMDb do you really want a long winded review? and you need to update your spell check you dumb knobs.",10,0,1,10 April 2012
The Ringer," Why would this movie get a 1 or 2?
",Good timing and rhythm and a great cast. Most all of the comedy in this falls well in between cheap shots and sensitive humor. I missed it on the screen and it was well worth renting. um... thats it I have to write 10 lines of text? Am I Leonard Maltin? OK..... I've worked with the Special Olympics It's not an entirely special experience Some DD's don't really want to do it nor do some of the staff..................... ............................ ............................. ..................................... ................................... ...................ridiculous guidelines,9,0,0,21 May 2006
