Skyfall," Well Mr Bond I'm Impressed.
","I cannot believe the quality of this film. From the opening to the end I was left hooked. There was lots of action but not so much that there was no story. I particularly liked the scenes towards the end were bond returns to his home to fight off Raoul, with help from the old gamekeeper and M. This movie was full of twists and turns from Raoul Silva being a former agent to the gripping finale with M's death. I find the opening to be particularly interesting with Adeles theme song titled 'Skyfall' being extremely fitting. The star performance in this movie goes to M herself. She clearly shows that shes underpressure and scared about what Raoul will do next.This film is really worth the watch.Joseph Baird",10,10,22,16 November 2012
