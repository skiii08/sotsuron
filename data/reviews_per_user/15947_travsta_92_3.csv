The Mask," Green is clean!
","The Mask, I would say has to be my first or second favourite Jim Carrey movie. He is extremely funny in the Mask, the acting of the mask he turns into is brilliant and hilarious! The way he moves his teeth makes me laugh out loud because its so damn funny! It definitely surprised me that such a good movie could be made in 1994.Also Cameron Diaz does a great job for I'm quite sure of her very first movie. I always thought she was quite pretty but just ordinary but when she came onto the see when I first saw the Mask earlier this year, my mouth dropped in awe. She looked so good! She began well, and I think it boosted her career with the stunning acting.I've always enjoyed the way Jim Carrey makes a fool of himself in such films as Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty. I am actually looking forward to seeing 'Fun with Dick And Jane'.FINAL RATING- Worth the watch, Classic Comedy!",7,0,0,12 December 2005
American Pie," A Great Start!
","I saw this movie 3 years ago because I was only 7 when this movie had been released. This is an amazingly funny and amusing sex comedy that will have your eyes glued to the TV set. The other good thing is that it has no limits to it's jokes like other movies where you need to be careful of how crude the jokes are. The storyline is great with four teen-aged boys make a pact to loose their virginity by Prom night as they fail to do so and it sends a message across to the audience.Steve Stiffler is very different to the second and the third and as I was watching the First film for the first time in a long while Stifler's swearing seemed a little forced. Such as at the beginning, 'Nova!!' 'What's up dude?' 'You coming to the Party tonight Ozzie you *beep* face?' seemed a little forced.A hilarious and amusing sex comedy with a great storyline is always something special.",10,0,0,24 January 2006
Wimbledon," Great Visual Effects, makes a great tennis movie!
","I had very low expectations when i went to see this movie because my Grandpa told me that it was a stupid movie. Only after I left the cinemas I remembered that Grandpa hates sports or comedies. I love sport and when I saw this movie I laughed, enjoyed the storyline with Lizzie Bradbury and Peter Colt. The visual effects were superb and wonderful how they could look like such good tennis players, though they have hardly played tennis in their lives! As soon as the movie came out I was lucky enough to borrow Wimbledon from my cousin and i loved every second of it. I soon bought it. Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany both did a great job at acting out as professional tennis players. If you love sport (especially tennis) this has enough action and comedy to make a great movie!",8,1,1,15 December 2005
