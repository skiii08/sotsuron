50 First Dates," Lifetime favourite
","This movie is my nostalgia and love.. It shows how you can love someone who boundlessly and without any condition. And the struggles hurdles , not just emotional struggles but a life changing disability and how the other one manages to cope up with it without giving up... Very beautiful movie.",10,3,3,7 January 2020
Bird Box," Satire turned to movie
","Its more of a Satire film made by the lady / Director. To somehow show the importance of showing positivity to kids in their lives and exposing them to better world, but why make a horror film to give a message.... And ruin it somehow by building an unknown tension which was at some point must be revealed without stretching it till the end...That type of art is acquired by a few directors only, like M Night shyamalan, Christopher nolan, steven speilberg... They can build an unknown fear and tension which is not directly shown and we are still scared. But here its a failure to an extent that the tension or the anticipation keeps rising and rising and it never actually gets to a point of unveiling!Thats mental torture, and not horror.. Yes there are scary situations and scenes, but the main concept was the thing which was doing it, which never got unveiled ever! All what they showed was, don't see, keep eyes closed, find ppl. Thats it.. What about emphasizing little upon that Phenomenon..! To show the audience whats doing it..... atleast in the end if you wanted ppl to bite their nails in anticipation.. Why wait till ppl bite their fingers off and anticipation turns into torture and incomplete venture....",4,0,0,8 October 2019
