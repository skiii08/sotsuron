Despicable Me 2," Jam & Jelly. Gripping stuff.
","The first film was genius. Everyone loves the bad guys, & there were plenty of them in the first film. Squid gun.. Oh Yeah! But this film not only had no purpose, but it destroyed the personality of ALL the characters. It starts off rather promising, with the mystery crime taking place. A giant magnet? Genius idea! They could have gone somewhere with the technology of that concept. Stealing the Eiffel Tower, ships at see, Rockets & weapons. But we never see or hear of it again. We don't even know who the villain is until the film is almost over. The first film was bold, edgy, had great ideas about the style of being bad. And Gru was a mad genius who was different, self aware, & refused to conform. He took advantage of how dumb other humans were, & he had a deep passion for his concepts. ALL that is gone in this film, & he is reduced to a bumbling idiot, desperate to get hitched. He is made to look a fool by an annoying woman from the start, & everyone just makes fun of him for the rest of the film. The eldest girl was smart, mature, responsible & lovable in the first film. In this film, she leaves her two youngest sisters on their own in a mall to go & have it off with a young boy who was taken straight out of the book of clichés. That's what this film is.. one long list of endless clichés. It's an insult to all who made the first film so intelligent & unique. It was a clever spy mad professor movie. I hate how it has been reduced to a soap opera chick flick. It puzzles me how this film has such a high rating. I suspect that IMDb is now fixing ratings for promotion techniques. And can no longer be trusted. Either that, or people have lost their standards today. After all, the films being made today are the worst kind of disposable trash imaginable. This one is no exception. AVOID.",2,10,16,21 October 2014
The Incredible Hulk," Batman format as usual...
","They seem to be working to a strict formula. And granted, the whole split personality tortured soul climbing up buildings at night thing worked for Batman. But it really didn't fit this movie at all. Not in the slightest.The CGI is extremely intrusive & fractures the whole feature every time it takes over. The Bad Guy's motive is.. er... I am bad! That's it! He practically is a generic bad guy who just acts bad for no apparent reason. It's so contrived.On top of these clichés, you have Team 'MURICA shouting about 'the perimeter' & other generic army nonsense. You have a General who doesn't know how to think or feel until he feels sorry for himself. And then you have the perfect understanding smoking hot girlfriend who is the most important person in the film. Go Team Girl Power! I seriously don't know who could enjoy films like this enough to want to watch more than once. I can't even think of anything insightful to say.. it's sucked the intelligence from my brain!! That's not the only thing it sucked.AVOID.",3,0,2,26 March 2015
Your Name.," 1 love 2 hearts
","As I delve into Anime at the tender age of 35(!) I notice a certain degree of passion driving these films. This is no exception. And yes! This film makes to believe that love can save the world! It's a bit cheesy at times but I take it as it is because of the Japanese humour! I must add though that I have never willed 2 characters to fall in love so bad! The film is endearing but also very intelligent. I recommend it. Though it is a slow burner, so give it your time & attention & it won't fail to move you.",10,2,4,23 November 2017
Zootopia," The Darkage of Animations has peeked.
","This was a painful watch. Maybe it is aimed at girls? But I just couldn't relate to the constantly happy happy joy joy galling cute annoying rabbit & the insipid fox. The other characters are only there when the jokes demand their involvement. Everything is so dull. So predictable. The story is a mess, the script is moronic, the performances are typical, the shots are trapped within what non-animated films would do, the music is throwaway pop, & the concept is a lazy attempt at racism. Even though all the characters are played by mostly white Caucasians.This has nothing special going for it. It's 'cute'. That's the hook. It will appeal to the brainwashed lowest common denominator. It won't resonate years to come like Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, WallE, or Wreck-it Ralph.",1,21,52,5 June 2016
The 13th Warrior," Hit & Miss!
","The 13th Warrior is a conflicted film of jaw dropping set pieces, profound detail, & stunning cinematography, which has a 'lets fight the savages' story & a 'Don't talk; fight' narrative. The men are too tough for tears, the women too scarce for encouragement & strength, the children are just props & the meaning is lost upon the project as though any soul would dirty the film. I can't believe so much money would be ploughed into a film without a solid script first! So much effort was clearly & painstakingly put into every frame of these frenetic battle sequences. And yet the shots are kept deliberately low which creates an even more uninspired experience than that purloined from the script itself! There is an appreciation to realism not found in Hollywood or any surviving studios who may have the kind of money to make films of this disappearing & under-appreciated genre, which makes it all the more disappointing. If only this demonstrated the level of love both men & women had for each other, it may translate to the passions adverse to love on the battlefield.Little effort is made to define the geography of this battleground either. I presume they are Greeks? As they were speaking the Greek tongue at the start of the film, but then what origins are the natives from? To make things worse, the Arab isn't even played  BY AN ARAB!! I hate how there is always an absence of darker skinned cast members in film. Bruce Lee had a vision where peoples of ALL cultural background worked together, but this seems to be lost upon both studios & audiences now. It's so embarrassing to have to watch hour after hour.. film after film of passive racist predilection.Anyway, it has moments of strategy but don't expect much more. This came & went like the weather seemed to do so in this flick! A wasted opportunity!",4,0,6,14 November 2016
The Others," Soul Destroying
","Seldom does a film this esoteric happen. And I think that this shall not appeal to everyone. But that is the point of making a difference. The horror genre has become very frivolous in later years. And I doubt enough people can appreciate the sophisticated subtlety & introspective nature of a film which aims to create a mood, a spyglass into the past, & with devastatingly convincing performances from the 4 main characters. So it is no surprise to me that this gets underappreciated. The film has me in tears every time I watch it about every 7 years. And as I get older, & regret my life choices, I can't help but let it scar me a little deeper each time. I suppose it feels very real to my own situation; lonely, heart broken, unable to move on, & destitute. It carefully switches from the suspense of being haunted, to the heart rending return of a lost loved war veteran; a father & husband. The music is exasperating in its' effectiveness. And you feel very trapped in this River Styx with them. This is not an easy watch. Not in terms of gore, horror, or violence. But because you can't help but pity each & every character. Especially the children, who spend much of the time on screen distressed. And are ultimately subjected to the worst scenario you can think of, through no fault of their own. There's a part where the husband breaks down in to tears as he realizes that he may have triggered the series of events by failing to profess all love for his family by going to fight in the war. It's a harsh scene that is doubly felt the second time round. If I ever watch this film again, I shall be 44 years old. I doubt I'll reach that age! But if I do, this film might be the end of me ha ha! Thankfully I don't believe in ghosts, gods, & gravestones. But I do believe in the imagination. And where that is concerned, all involved with this film did a fine job.",8,0,0,17 October 2018
Rise of the Guardians," Would have worked better as an ADULT Feature
","This story is from a totally innovative & aberrant angle of the modern day fairy-tale. Farther Christmas with machetes?! I instantly fell in love with it's un-restrictive execution.. at first. First off, this is Dreamworks best piece in their long line of rivalry towards Pixar. The visuals are simply divine, the renders are lush, the colours are vibrant & the detail is at last matching that of Pixar & Disney! The voice acting was a very sagacious risk by the producer who mixes cultures & accents; something parochial American audiences always tend to detest. 'OMG.. There's other people on this planet other than us? This is an American film.. it should keep US-only cast.. Boo Hoo'! Get over yourselves!! It works a treat in this film & they all worked rather well accept.. well, sandman! Luckily they kill this podgy Ewok Lemon off quite soon so we don't have to keep making allowances for him. He's later restored, which doesn't work really. We don't care. Never missed him in the first place! Matt Smith plays a devastatingly convincing role as the Bad Guy in this I must say! Jude Law fills in for one of his horses too! Now the cons! The music. It fits well.. Yarrr.. like how wind fits into a good view maybe? the point I'm making is that it is bland. ALL the cues, All the instrumentation, chord combinations, & sounds used are completely STOCK. It has but ONE melody for the fleeting title card, but this isn't even vaguely captivating. And once again, it seems that all the boring combinations of tenor range performances make for a very forgettable transparent mix. There's the usual LOW drones for the Bad Guy, nice mallets & mellifluous plucks for the ice scenes, & action simply requires brass stabs & everything else just blares together to reach volume that is inevitably pushed down with compression anyway. This kind of film required something MUCH more bold & contemporary. A whimsical vocal choir of just a few female sopranos, some avant-garde string sweeps, some synth-sculpted icicles along with a foreboding distorted villain theme perhaps? The possibilities are endless! But NO. It's just another score. Yawn. Composed on a PC with VSTi no doubt. Uninspired & tame. This film has a very serious back-story with a lot of emotion at it's core. It even takes it's somewhere with Jack's past life - heavy stuff that could have worked very well. He could have considered Pitch's offer & joined him for a while. And they should have had a 1 on 1 duel at the end without the silly slapstick. But I guess it was too dark? The problem we have with these films is that they are far too frivolous without the contrasting seriousness to them. Pixar gets away with it because they make them memorable with poignancy & sentimentality. You can't remember something frivolous. and although it makes you laugh, it's an extremely temporary feeling. This film could have been a triumph if the parties involved allowed it to be intelligent, sophisticated, a bit more mature, & yes.. ADULT. Pan's labyrinth & Water Ship Down are rare breeds; one of a kind. Because money is the focus here. Not the film. It's still an enjoyable film even if it is disposable. And I like how they added some adult content. But it really needed lifting to the next level & treated seriously to balance out the humour. Close! But no cigar!",9,1,4,13 November 2014
The Hustler," A Frustrating Game of Clichés
","I don't know. Maybe I'm just not getting it? Is this some American thing that Brits don't get? Everyone seems to be feeling very 'enlightened' having been shown that talent doesn't accommodate success, & yet the whole world is full of talented people who are forced to palette their mundane lives built on the foundations of moral bankruptcy & economic slavery. The only way people 'Win' as far as I can see is luck & cheating. It's not like talented people rule countries around the world; it's not as though the top 10 billboard artists know their musical craft. It's about miserable people wanting to inflict more misery on others than they themselves have experienced. This is nothing new. The only difference here is that this sad fact of our corruption fits in to all the clichéd macho tropes of trite Hollywood media. Sarah - being a 'female' knows exactly what's going on - easy to seduce. Eddie - being a bloke gets angry when he doesn't get his own way. Bert - being a 'Businessman' only thinks in terms of money. Fats - is.. guess what! A Fat Man!! And he don't talk much man! Yeah man! Cool man! What a load of cods wallop! There's no subtlety in any of these performances which are dragged on & on & on until it becomes a frustrating chore. It's so very blatant that 'Winning is knowing when to quit' & that 'No amount of money can buy a girl like Sarah'. The other message here is that people love to hate talented people. But the protagonist for some reason that eludes me is too retarded to grasp this simple philosophy of life. And instead chooses to go on a self-egotistical rampage out of greed, self denial, & fear of running out of booze & sex. ??? You couldn't make this stuff up!! Even the dead drunk irate poleaxe student bum Sarah makes more sense than the rest of these pretend characters at one point! But hey man.. it's Pool man yeh! And pool is cool yeh? So Spoiler alert: The best character in the film, the one you tolerate the film for; the girl Sarah, takes it upon herself to kill herself, but not before sleeping with the creep 'Bert' who insults her, threatens her, sexually assaults her, & tells her to disappear. Why? Coz it takes the death of a bright young lady (who merely needed love) in order for the douche bag to finally win that darn game of cool pool & take home a small fortune! So the moral to this story kids, is that if you wanna win a game of pool, you've got to loose at life first! Yeh man! Cool, man!What a waste of my time.",3,7,16,20 March 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Boy!
","After the more adult cliff hanger of the last film, one would expect Spider-man to follow a more mature & intelligent return than this spin-off slop! 
What is this? Spider-Kid?All the action is virtually impossible to follow as per the trite 'shaky cam' technique & the score is forgettable. Characters exclaim at one another as the script kills brain cells. But seriously! This toddler looks so silly in the custom I'm surprised his sleeves down drape over his hands!",2,8,12,20 September 2018
Man of Steel," Not even Superman could save this film!!
","This is a such a confounded mess, I don't know where to begin & if I can end. It tries so hard to replicate the impact of the Original Superman 1978 but is just a product of its' time. A time of a complete cultural darkage. First of all, the script no doubt appeases the comic-fans' desire to hear all the boring nerdy details of Superman's origins, but for those who aren't obsessed with comics, there's nothing even vaguely interesting in this script that we can compare with our own experiences. And these lines ARE dire! I mean, really bad beyond belief! 'You're a monster Zod, and I'm going to stop you'!! There are too many moments like this which have your eye-rolls inducing a headache! ________ Visuals: As per this era, everything is saturated, all colour is reduced, the camera shakes constantly & the CGI has you so disconnected with reality - you cannot possibly care what happens on screen. In fact, the best moment in the film is when Clark has some real-life interactions with kids on a school bus which inevitably has to be pushed out of the water by Superman. Heaven forbid there's one moment in this film that isn't a set piece. __________ CGI Mess: The CGI is sterile, shiny, pristine, over exposed, overused, intrusive, boring to look at, & represents the key-problem with action in modern films. You never felt for one second in Richard Donner's original that this was a film showcased by technology. Man of Steel is so reliant on technology that there is nothing that can save the film. Once you begin to see just how cartoonish & overblown the effects are, the film looses all grip on reality & its' relevance quickly diminishes. I'm not saying Superman is real, but everything around him.. planet earth IS real. Or it's meant to be. But it all just looks like computer game cutscenes. Technology is destroying our films, & if you or anyone can't see this just because trend has blinded you... this is going to have major repercussions once the flame dies down. __________ Audio/Sound: The sound in this film is a constant onslaught of noises, Sound effects & bland music just as sterile & characterless as the the visuals. There's a reason why John Williams doesn't need to use heavy Feral Drum Percussive Thrashing in his scores. And that is because he doesn't need to compensate for a lack of perfection with a desperate reliance on volume. His scores sound emotionally charged & yet delicately fervent today. And he has never capitulated his inimitable sound to participate in generic trends. I hate this constant banging of drums in scores today. It sounds so servile. So pathetic. The tone of a true coward composer who's talent has been crushed by the desire to perpetuate & infatuate themselves for the good of money. There's not ONE cue in this car crash of a film which inspired me, stood out as exemplary, or was memorable enough to last with me even after the film. Except maybe the constant thrashing of those drums. The rest of the sounds are piled on top of more sounds & so on. Until its such a convoluted mess of stems. You really can't appreciate what you can't hear clearly. But there's not much to appreciate anyway, because of how digitally crystal clean cut everything is. Part of what invites you into the creative process is picking up on tiny details; human imperfections, vulnerabilities & mistakes! But everything creative here has been hidden, & locked away in the stone cold insipid ramifications of the digital age. Killing everything artistic & making sure everything is dull. _________ Performances: When the film isn't too hell-bent on set pieces & trailer fodder, sometimes the actors are permitted to speak. Seldom are they ever allowed to bare resemblance to our own mundane lives however! Because the film has so much action to thrown at you, there is little time for character development or levity. Everything is uttered as though it were for the trailer. And once again, you aren't allowed to get close to these people. Their lives don't resemble our own for just 1 minute, & you end up.. as always... not caring what happens. How can you? How can you care for characters you don't know personally? The achievement of a truly great film is its' ability to make you feel as though you are right there in the movie! You see yourself through the eyes of these people by relating their experiences to your own. You forget it's not real & is just a movie as a result of how pitch perfect & clandestine all the production techniques are. This is the kind of skill that only the best directors possess. And very few master. (Stanley Kubrick is the best example) This is the epitome of 'all things gone wrong'. The film constantly reminds you that everything on screen is not real. The people are not real. Even the lens which is attached to the camera is not real. Everything has a digital effect on. Whether its a shaky blur, RGB alteration, deep contrast contortions, what ever. The end product has me utterly disconnected emotionally with everything going on in this calamity. This truly is a darkage we are being exposed to in Blockbusters. But that just makes it even more apparent that we should all be looking towards smaller budget films for entertainment. New talent which doesn't need a quarter of a million dollars to create tension. As Shakespeare once said 'Full of Sound & Fury, Signifying Nothing.'I condone this awful film & those who made it. Christopher Reeve is turning in his grave. And considering he was palsied for the latter part of his life; that is quite an achievement. Avoid. 1/10.",1,2,5,27 March 2016
Ratatouille," Serves your heart up on a platter
","At first, many might simply take this as a crazy film where a rat cooks food with cliché french characters. But it is so much more for those who feel trapped outside the kitchen where they believe they belong. Pixar's team have something extra ordinary in making these films. It's nothing to do with the clarity of visuals, the fast pace of the character development, the crystal clear audio or the jokes at sophisticated level that makes cartoons more introspective & emotionally valuable than other films. It's the stories they tell that makes them so powerful. And this particular title is NO exception. This film throws SO many punches at your soul. And maybe I'm just on my own here, but by the end of it, I am a quivery mess of tears & memories. I can relate to the outcast dilemma of being hopeful when surrounded by mundane people who take pride in making you feel like some sort of traitor for setting dreams as a paramount pursuit. The burning relentless torture of that desire to create, as though art runs through your veins. And the inherent loneliness you submerge yourself into by perpetuating these thoughts. It doesn't matter that he's a rat. I feel his pain as though it were my own. I can relate straight away to the young boy, desperate to find a job, a home, a family & reach for a purpose that might offer an argument to an otherwise pointless life. It's helped with slapstick to easy the load off of my mind! But not for long, because then we see a modern day brotherhood between unsuspecting friends whose opposing circumstances in life doesn't stop them from relying on each other. However, these are mere flee bitings compared with the next real life comparisons. Living up to your farther's reputation & expectations can be an impossible struggle. We have the girl who walks out on the boy, but who actually comes back - a rare breed these days! But nothing wrenched my heart out as much as the final scene where something made with love reminds the critic of the love & the memory of his mother & her cooking. Our senses are so much more than tools for perception. Inside every human is a wealth of happy memories we all look back on with a certain amount of sadness & nostalgia, & every so often we are reminded of these people that mean so much to us that they are a part of us. Something as infinitesimal as tasting a piece of food can relate to a thousand memories we strive to keep locked up. This film & others by the Pixar Disney team open the flood gates to these fundamental emotions & let us revel in them so we can remember the most important experiences in our lives. Others can talk about the visuals, & the voice acting & all that. But for me, this story cracked me open like an egg, scrambled my emotions, & dish me up a side helping of laughter too! My only complaint would be that it had to end at one point.",9,0,2,6 November 2014
Mamma Mia!," Women have no soul
","This is the reason women can't be taken seriously; fear of not feeling happy during every single second of their bourgeois lives. The level of sophistication, realism & creativity is at an all time low. Every 'chick flick' cliché is used over & over with absolutely NO context or affiliation with the songs purloined from the Abba estate. Every situation is lived out in 3-year old perspective where bad things can never happen. Middle aged women renounce all vestige of their hobbies, interests & pursuits in order to fall in line to do exactly what is expected of them. Any deviation would require character, conviction & confidence! Ha ha I know right?! So by the time they reach this default subservient stage in their life, they hinge all happiness on looking back. They can hardly look at the present because that would be tantamount for self-examination; & they can hardly look to the future when they've forfeited all freedom of choice in order to blend into the background. This leaves one thing that they all have in common - nostalgia. Nostalgia is irrational, & this predilection with everything ancient hinders the ability to judge your tastes in a non-bias fashion. Abba is the epitome of nostalgia!! They're even worse than the Beatles themselves! At least their songs didn't all just sound like a string of one hit wonders. This film is a disastrous instance of the formulaic juke box musical with clichéd jokes, paper thin narrative, typical throw away characters, lazy writing, & everything that happens is from a vain female perspective. It's like women who are in denial need to keep feeding their delusion by piling up pseudo laughs in a constant flurry to distract themselves from the more valuable things in life. It's sad that many air heads gave this film a 10 star rating. This score is usually reserved for those films that are life changing. The irony is, this film is so blatantly made to stop their lives from changing. Keep distracting yourselves.. haha I am laughing. Ha ha I like this film. Ha ha I must not think. There are much better films of this nature that aren't such a detriment to chick flicks. Go & find them. And for Gods sake listen to some new music, buy some new underwear, check out game of thrones, read a new e-book, buy a new video game, take up a sport etc! 'Be'.",1,7,11,12 March 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," Enter Coin - Press START!
","I was not ready for the emotions this film stirred in me! And although there's a lot of clichés in this film, it never, ever, not once, interferes with the narrative & morale of the story. Let me just say now that the first 30 minutes of this (nice long) film doesn't grab you that much. It's all so surreal & uncanny! Your nostalgia begins to take hold of course! The characters & dialogue are predictable as the games they inhabit. Then a deeper, more introspective undercurrent begins to unfold. It is balanced with the humour & peril perfectly though. Once you're introduced to the character of Vanellope aka The Glitch, the context of the story starts rebuilding at it's foundations but with twice the importance & you really begin to get sucked in. It's strange. These characters & their lives couldn't be further away from the reality of our own, & by the end of the film you're so emotionally invested in these people that you want to jump in the screen to protect them! The graphical style throughout this film never ceases to stun you. I've always seen CGI as an intruder to the creative solutions of film making, & it has spoilt a LOT of films for me. But it works in reverse with animated films such as this. There was a life's worth of ideas thrown in to the design concepts of this picture, and it exhibits great restraint at the nascent stages of the film in order to accelerate them. There is no way you will be able to acknowledge all the details of this film in one sitting. So it's longevity is secured. The voice acting is OTT of course, but connects to the visuals in fundamental ways. I have to hand it to the actors who not only brought these characters to life, but made them so vivid & lovable. To many, this film will be just another cartoon equivalent; an afternoon's entertainment; or a good laugh for the kids. But to people like myself, it means so much more. When you're a child, you are not equipped with enough answers to build confidence. Some use ego instead to fake the real thing. But many have their confidence destroyed at this vulnerable stage. When I was a child, I had no friends for a long time. It was something I could never deal with. But video games helped me build a fantasy away from reality. My friends were Pacman, Mario, Zelda, Samus, etc. The point I am making is that anyone who ever grew up with video games will never have anything but love & gratitude for them. I feel sorry for those who were purloined of this privilege. I feel a kind of affinity to these characters, because they are the building blocks to my childhood. Not an ideal one maybe. But this film really hit home by the last half hour, & I found myself weeping for their cause. You feel their struggles, as all your own come flooding back. The bugs destroying the world underground felt like the equivalent of the situation I was in when my parents were arguing night after night after school; the deep contrasts of a young boy trying to have fun to salvage another day of bullying & inferiority. Children also wish to be surrounded by candy & sweets, & yet they somehow know it's all cosmetic. And finally, we know that feeling of being trapped like Vanellope - the odd one out. Growing up is seeing these fantasies in you die slowly. This is what gives nostalgia both it's irrationality & tragedy. It's like reality is still bleak, but you can't retreat back in to your fantasy anymore. You simply have the memory of that safe place. Vanellope is the one instance where she gets her memories back AND gets to go back to her fantasy. This is a fairy tale of the modern era. And it has a happy ending I still pray for to this very day. It's so absurd that I am here crying for fictional characters that don't even exist, because of society's failure to put the more quintessential human qualities before his fear bread desires.I may be on my own as usual in this statement as to this film's frivolity & mundane entertainment value. But I rather suspect that this film shall mean so much more to some people who dare to let it take a look back at your own video game. Every game gets it's plug pulled in the end. Better to win one race than none.",10,3,4,22 October 2014
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I Live Again Tomorrow
","A film like this comes around once every 2000 years. It has so many points of interest that I would no doubt have to create a film just to explore them! As human beings, we are free to use our senses, emotions, intelligence & inspiration to seek enlightenment. But instead, we have created a society hinged upon avarice, forged in fear, stunted by traditions & institution & sealed with an unhealthy desire for distraction. Living in these primitive times frustrates me, & foreseeing just how far man shall go to maintain such a dull & predictably dire way of life fills me with despair & self-inflicted peril. The principles hidden in this film touch on the future's way of thinking; when all the resources have been squandered, & we are reduced to re-assess the circumstances of 'living' & 'dying'. Every single character in this film displays an intractable dilapidation from the demands society imposes upon them. We have the elder female servant who was denied training due to her gender even though the passion was present. The young government official who covets an opposite life of free will, feral love & irresponsibility. A rogue who found a home following the stars, but who is forced to conform to a life of aristocratic servitude for love. Then we have a woman of age who has the flexible pilgrim lifestyle but is destitute of honest expression; bound by love from a man of 'mind over matter' who looses his will to strong emotional confliction to both 'Love' AND 'Hate'! It all ramifies so perfectly. 'Only by letting go can we finally possess what is real'. The philosophy behind this fairytale is perhaps lost on westerners of vacuity & subservience. My friend was only invested in the 'Who Dunit' aspects at the start, & fell asleep by the sword fight scene. And my farther grunted uncomfortably as to cavil at every meaningful scene like some over gorged sebaceous parliamentary private secretary. Sometimes I wonder if I am the only person on the planet who acknowledges profound contemplation & introspection. The cinematography in this film is startlingly sparse & fleeting at times but is never hidden within frenetic edits with Adobe After FX abound. Some of the shots look a bit washed & grainy but it really just adds to the ethos of a dream-like picture. You're on the brink of romance & illusion at all times; sometimes questioning your every decision in life, & what life truly is. I have to mention the score. At first, you don't think much of it. The drums of the first fight scene are typical of overused cues today. But as the film & tension climbs, the music responds ten fold. Tan Dun launches you into masterpiece after masterpiece with an extremely intimate reduction of highly disciplined players. It is extremely contemporary, & woes you into a euphoric trance. It's hard not to fall in love with both Michelle & the celestial Ziyi Zhang as they reign conflict in this world of wonder. And the composer maybe did a too good -a job here because it is so unlike anything you've heard from any other score; it haunts you to re-watch it for those captivating moments when capitulating gliding strings hypnotize as the counterparts climb swaying bamboo to a enchanted uncharted canopy. It really stings my senses raw. It's a shame that there's news of a 'sequel' coming to light. It will without a doubt lack the impact of this masterpiece, & shall be a detriment to it's name. Mark my words, the sequel shall only cash in on the success of this title & belittle the underlining allegorical struggles of this story; the corporate world I originally abnegated returning to destroy the glimpse of deeper discontent this film bestowed on us. This film will always have a place in my heart; Jen shall always resonate with my arrogance of youth, desire to be free from family, society & institution, & most of all.. she shall tell the story of the lost potential of such a lack of discipline. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon may have a long winded & misunderstood name. However, it resides in all of us if we only let in the demons that guard the answers.",10,0,0,20 February 2015
Frozen," Cold as Ice
","According to IMDb, this forgettable title is better than Cinderella!! I have never seen an animated film that has been premeditated as much as this. I'm serious. Everything is a mess. Nothing feels natural. I get the feeling that the writers weren't capable of the level of commitment to simplicity to meet the brief. We don't need plot twists in everything today. With a simple narrative, you can really work some personality into the characters, obtain a depth of atmosphere, & release your grip on a set formula to create something truly unique.There are so many plot holes. For every good idea, there are 3 bad ones.I really love the idea of bringing back music in films. I believe Disney's best films are musicals. But the music is just forgettable & conservative. I cannot tell you how much opportunity there was for a girl who has magical powers for a huge over the top set piece! We could have had spinning icicles, singing snowmen, icebergs turned up-side down for drums etc. But ALL the songs are so.. insipid. I happen to be a producer myself, & I noticed that all the songs had a very clean adult conservative 'Studio' sound to them. Bass guitar, orchestra, vocals. Boring. I would have created a piece with just mallets, Bells, a few synths & a Deep Bass to it. But I suppose that is TOO young, fresh, & drastic for the multi-millionaire, old timers, in their wood-floor furnished studios. Such a wasted opportunity.The main aspect of the story that really gets my moose up is the question of the protagonist. Elsa is a fascinating character at the start. The whole mystery with how she got her powers is never addressed; typically. She is the main character at this point. But then the plot comes in & ruins everything. We barely see or hear a peep out of her until the main chapter where she runs off. And we're meant to care about this? It would have been nice to see her struggle more, to see how regretful she is, & how she is tempted to see her sister, Anna. But instead, she comes off as a stroppy stolid stoic drag queen.The parents dying can be seen from a MILE off. Once again, the plot interferes with what you know you would enjoy the most. Everything is forced. Kristoff, works selling Ice! This feels as though it's meant to tie up with the powers that she has for creating ice. But it's never addressed! Elsa shuns her sister at every opportunity, runs off, & hides away ALL to 'protect her sister' but freezes her heart at the first opportunity after not much very clunky dialog & even creates a huge massive Ice Monster which throws her off a cliff. None of which makes any kind of sense. But oh.. ha ha the snowman is funny ha ha! I loved the snowman part so I'll give this a 10/10! This is what these silly little girls must be doing.Because there is NO WAY that this awful mess is anywhere as good as Cinderella. FACT.Quote of the film: 'The Past is in the Past' - Genius! What a joke this rating system is.",1,7,19,25 October 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," I Hate Flashbacks...
","This film is a mess of convoluted narratives, uncoordinated action, & protracted character development for far too many characters.A film should tell one story. But amongst all the technological prattle we have several story details which breaks up the movie into sections which no one single audience bracket can appreciate.This film has all the aspects I hate in bad writing. An enemy you can't see, an enemy with psychic powers (Batman & Robin pheromone dust?) which breaks up the film's momentum, flashbacks, good guys fighting each other, taking the heroes weapons away, the forced love affair, meeting the cool guy's pregnant wife & kids, girl power, a villain that keeps regenerating, & a new hero that overshadows the rest.The action is so disconnected. Take the fight with Thor at the end. They start fighting, you want to see this fight AND.... Cut to another scene. It takes about 4 minutes during the finalé to come back to this scene. And the Hulk you forget is there! The first avengers were all working together, & you got a real sense of timely continuity during the battle.You want to see the heroes face a new enemy, gear up with new tools, & show this bad guy who's boss! That's what the story needed to be! But you're hardly rooting for them to save the day at the end because apart from the fact you're so bored by then, you've lost all belief in them. They squabble all the way through, they let mere memories defeat them, & you never feel a desire for these cookie cutter robots to get destroyed by them. It's like those droids from the Star Wars Prequels all over.The Avengers were assembled to protect mankind. This worked in the first film. In this film? Humanity just gets in the way of their CGI Battles. They ppss everyone off, destroy everything, not a peep out of the government, & kill all the robots that they themselves were responsible for creating.. Yay.. erm.. Hooray? What a mess this film is.Creativity needs freedom. I guess the writer was stifled were creativity was concerned.",3,3,13,12 March 2016
The Mummy Returns," 90% Cartoon, 10% dire dialog
","This is the 2nd instalment of one of the worst trilogies ever created. The entire film lacks mood & realism, & instead swaps it for frivolous comedy, & Nintendo Computer effects without a single drop of blood. I have never seen such bad CGI in a film with a budget as overpaid as this. Everything on screen looks fake, embarrassingly cheap, & totally sterile. The editing is frenetic & the ending as a result is a frustrating watch. All the characters are annoying & there are no pay-offs in this film as a result of the child-friendly restraints. Save your time for films worth a watch. This is dreadful slop.",2,0,1,9 March 2016
Downfall," Compassion is an eternal sin. - Hitler
","This is undoubtedly a priceless work of art. And a impinging one. The world knows who Hitler was to this day. He is perhaps the most famous man in history. And yet until now, we knew very little about his persona. History is written by the victors, & they may dispatch a figure's name & reputation how they see fit. This film gives you the privilege you crave to reconcile the hatred & insanity to a mere mortal man to judge for yourself. There are many pivotal scenes that require your full attention not only to detail but to the undercurrents of everyone's emotional loyalties. One scene shows us that Hitler refuses to give any empathy for his people who are by now suffering the worst. In fact, he reassures that they must perish for their lack of loyalty, & where loyalty is concerned, the ultimate sacrifice must be made. None can be spared. And yet he sheds a tear for himself in the very next scene when he hears of betrayal from a recreant.Hitler was a mad man always on the borderline of insanity, & every time you are convinced he has passed such a threshold, he suddenly opines a statement of great vision & understanding of his predicament. You almost have to admire him for such a key mind at times & yet you know what he is doing is utterly wrong. His people in the city of Berlin are suffering all around in the midst of prolonged war whilst he scoffs down platefuls of food in comfort. The man disgusts you as he should, yet this thread of respect you bare is a dangerous one. Couple this with the almost certain omitted information as to his more benevolent accruement which arises intermittently & you begin to build a picture of a man. Not a monster.Adolf was either a weak man for his fear of kindness or he was strong for his partisan devotion towards cruelty. Who is fit to judge? All you can do is observe & let your soul react accordingly. This film is an inspired experience for anyone who has the patience to watch it.",10,0,1,3 June 2015
Rango," A waste of water
","The reason why this movie doesn't work is very simple. And it relates to the main character. He sucks. He is annoying, he lies, he is a misfit, has a warped sense of reality, he is ugly, everything he says frustrates you, & his entire character has NO meaning.If you can relate to the main character, everything suddenly becomes relevant to you. But there is nothing more unrelatable than the age-old 'Fate protects fools' scenario. John Depp has never impressed me. He is one of these celebrities that has had a privileged life due to his looks, & not due to his acting ability. His over-acting in Pirates of the Caribbean, creepy acting in Charlie & the Chocolate Factory & his bemusing portrayal of this character only further convinces me of this.I hate films like this. You hate the main character SO much, but you want to see him do something right because you feel sorry for the other characters that are so desperate they believe in him. That's not enjoying a film. That is a film making you feel awkward. That's what this film does.. it makes you feel awkward. Johnny Depp's middle name perhaps?! It isn't helped by the fact that the creators were so obviously hungry to make this an adult feature, but the studio interfered & wanted it to remain a kids film - which it is NOT. Greed obviously stepped in & ruined the project, but I doubt it would have made much difference. The characters are so backwashed & aberrant that you loose your will to live early on in the film. Talking philosophically with road kill, a slap stick chase with an eagle, & then cryptic dialog with a female lizard who is stoical as she is stupid, for no reason that becomes obvious.Some of the jokes I expected to laugh at considering their bizarre & elementary nature! However, I didn't laugh once throughout this film, because I couldn't stop cringing at Mr Bean.I'm also one of few people who did not like the visuals. I don't want CGI to presume to replace reality. I don't want animations to look like the usual sterile cut scenes you get in films today. I want animations to look animated. I saw Tangled recently, & it blew me away. It didn't look real in any sense, but it made me forget I was watching an animated film at times. THIS on the other hand never let me forget how proud they were of the textures they shoved down my throat with close ups at every possible moment.Some of the music cues were pretty good, if wasted on this feature. It's a shame that we don't get this level of commitment from artists abound, not just film score composers.Overall, this film fails to entertain on so many levels that I think it's actually damaged the Western scene somewhat. It tries SO hard & yet fails so early on. Even Jim Carrey would have been a better choice! Oh dear God! Stay well clear!",2,1,1,26 October 2014
The Greatest Showman," DEAD on Arrival
","This film is yet another 'Here today, burned tomorrow' flick. The acting is ham, the dialogue is austere, the Auto-Tuned singing impressions of Beyoncé are irritating & the characters, settings, & story are all so contrived.The music itself is so generic, predictable, basic & regurgitated. A good musical has a song to fit every mood. Loss, Sorrow, Wonder, Yearning, Love, Betrayal, Introspection, Rebellion, Triumphant, etc. But every number has to start slow & end in a big cluttered Bill Board Crescendo of 'Happy Happy Jo Joy'. The way everyone relies on portamento.. gliding from note to note in order to avoid landing on correct notes is distracting & run of the mill.Their structures are conventional, as are the 4 chords they tend to use over & over.. just like pop music. All in simple time.The shaky cam, frenetic editing, & acrobatic cinematography deliberately divests us of witnessing any choreography. The CGI backdrops & other random assets shows where they glued the scenes together in their spare time on Sunday afternoons. And as for the sound? Everyone sings mute; obviously, as the pitch-corrected & over-compressed Mic-crisp breaths never sound real. But what is real in this god awful film?Maybe everything & everyone are just CGI props, polygons, with platitudes of one over-privileged prig in the film itself? And it created itself? After all, it is hard to believe that any human could create such a dire monstrosity. Unless it's a Hollywood feature of course.Utterly forgettable. Only the mindless shall think it is good.",1,5,10,4 February 2019
Amélie," Heart of Glass
","I think there is a lack of both European Films & Romances of innocent qualities aimed at adults in this way. The film is shot in a dream like way, but the realism is here too. What makes this film so appealing to all ages is that the cast are of all ages! We see less & less senior roles in film today as the art becomes a commodity for the younger demographic. My hopes & doubts of seeing another film as whimsically competent as this are equalised by my discontent of technologies interference in cheapening the process of falling in love with sterile forms of social media. But perhaps that is for the best. This film shall remain heart melting to the romantic as it is controversial to the loveless.For me, it was a very nice experience when I needed it the most.",9,0,1,16 July 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Half Good, Half Bad
","I'm not for or against this film. I don't get my knickers in a twist over a bit of GCI blood, violence, profanity or the endless clichés. I AM however against the injudicious amount of CGI used in every other shot, & the fact that this film falls apart about half way through. Seriously, you have a bit of realism at the start & it's fairly grounded. But as it goes on it becomes more & more Disney. Until about half way through, right about when a certain character meets his demise, & it just gets reduced to the Hollywood way - Everyone suddenly knows martial art, acrobatics, gymnastics; Slo-Mo to compensate for how slow western audiences are, TERRIBLE lighting, CGI backgrounds, intrusive generic epic music, & the all time high 'Girl power doing round house kicks' cliché. Colin Firth has such inimitable demeanour that he is the only one that sells the story. But the kid that takes over? My God he was a chore to watch. They also try to level the playing field where sex is concerned by having male & female protagonists en-roll for The Secret Service. Another dumb idea seeing that in reality not 1 single woman has worked as a secret agent. This is no doubt taken as discrimination by those as stupid as post feminists, when in reality it is a simple fact that men are more physically dexterous. They soon push her to one side anyway & have the boy get all the screen time. Samuel Jackson has his moments & is fun to watch but he is non-threatening & you feel sorry for the likable character he builds up. His henchman once again has to be a fit young slender brunette who dodges bullets, never gets scared, shows no emotion, jumps around like a flea on a griddle blah blah blah the usual male-written girl-power tripe. The 'controversial' church scene is the best in the movie which is probably why it sticks out. It's brutal, impressively shot, bloody & shows conviction. Which is FAR more than I can say for the rest of the film which goes soft & shows a blatant hesitation of following through. All of a sudden blood is swapped for cheap puffs of coloured smoke copied & pasted in perfect synchronisation in all harmless humour so as to not offend the next lot of screen test reprobates. What a joke. What a mess this film is. Avoid or watch drunk with the Mrs.",3,5,10,12 August 2015
Cinderella Man," Respond like an echo..
","Although Crowe isn't a fully emotional man, & you won't see him burst out in tears on screen that often, he is a force like no other. And this is perhaps his best performance. Thankfully, the director behind this film didn't try to be clever & move away from the formula. And it works. It just works! I felt that Robin Hood & Noah were long dead in the water before Russell ever stepped foot on set. A bad movie is defined very easily, & it is when the guy in the editing room wants to be center of attention - with frenetic strobe edits, Adobe After Effects, over-saturation resulting in loss of colour etc. Or when the director puts his own 'spin' on a classic story by being 'original'. Originality, too many special effects, & unrealistic action doesn't make a good film. A great story does. And this is truly a perfect example.The pace of the film is intelligent & modest, the score by Thomas Newman is typical Newman cues but fits extremely well in peeking your emotions, the editing is a little choppy at times but thankfully it doesn't split up the narrative too much, but the actors are the ones we can relate to. And they did a spectacular job here. Renee Zellwegger is really something special & shines bright even up against Crowe which can be hard.Boxing is a violent sport & is so often affiliated with rage & a desire to look good. It's not very appealing for many. But here we have a man who is fighting for love. And that's what makes this so powerful. It's also a story of hope for the underdog. I can't help feeling that in my own reconciliation with free will, this story re-enforces my belief that we can change our destiny. For that alone, it is worth the watch, even if you don't like boxing.",9,1,1,12 February 2015
