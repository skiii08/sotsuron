Requiem for a Dream," One of the most visually interesting yet disturbing films of all times
","By far this film has to be one the most disturbing films of all time. Right up there with Born on the 4th of July and Breaking the Waves.  However not only is it disturbing (which I qualify as an achievement in film) but also is it revolutionary in its stylized portrayal of addiction.  Ellen Burstyn's performance is amazing.  It is wonderful to see a woman of her success and tenure as an actress not afraid to take on such an edgy role.  I think Aronofsky is truly gifted and will be one of the great directors of our time.  If you like film and are not afraid of leaving the theatre feeling like you just got raked over the emotional coals..run don't walk to see this on the big screen, its well worth the roller coaster ride.  Beware it is very very graphic.",10,0,0,20 January 2001
