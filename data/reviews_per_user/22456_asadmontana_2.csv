Mission: Impossible III," Great Film But Brian De Palma's Directing Would Be Better
","i went to see mission impossible 3 the day after it came out. The atmosphere throughout the film was brilliant and it really showed off some great directing, acting and special effects. However i can't help thinking how good this third instalment would have been had Brian De Palma directed it. John Woo messed things up in number two but this final movie was surprisingly good. If you are after an action film with suspense and a great plot watch this. However if your a die-hard Palma fan like me you will still see room for improvement. Cruise's acting is still really good at his age.

Casino Royale," So Predictable
","As a film it is abysmal. Pretty ordinary stuff you have seen before. Been there done that standard. The film has some good twists to keep you on the edge but really this is the only thing decent. Craig is a meat head who batters the daylights out of criminals. Weren't OO'S meant to be suave and sophisticated. I.E. Sean Connery. All Craig does is beat some guys up straight away. So predictable. The Bond girls are alright but again predictable as before. The 2.5 hr film is filled with standard violence, few explosions, cheesy reply's and where the hell are the gadgets and Q? Average film Definitely not the best bond! ONly watch it if you have time to kill.",7,6,10,18 November 2006
