Raiders of the Lost Ark," Even the ride at Universal beats a lot of other films.
",Great action film. Very funny! Great heroine! Harrison Ford! What more could one ask for? And on the side of truth and beauty.,9,0,0,15 February 1999
Shakespeare in Love," We don't get the opportunity to see many good films. Don't miss it.
","This movie has a lot going for it. It seems to be developing into an extremely hyped up phenomenon like Titanic. 'The best Shakespeare movie ever made!' Well I've heard that line regarding a few Shakespeare related films, for instance Romeo and Juliet, the Zeffirelli production with Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting. I remember seeing that at the Paris Theatre, by the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, a favorite cinema when I lived there. It was a great film. I stood on line for hours and had to take a seat in the second row. Whenever I think of that film, I get severe neck pains.This is not the best Shakespeare movie to ever be made, nor the best ever made even, a couple of years from now. However it is a most enjoyable film. It is lighthearted, and lots of fun. I could not help but think of it as some sort of Disney treatment of the period, after seeing Elizabeth the night before. The theatre scenes are quite good, I thought. Even though they take place in the old days, the scenes project the world of entertainment, where people mostly have a good time. Everything in the film contributes to that good feeling, the lovely custumes, the little theatre, the street scenes, the healthy looking young specimens... Their Elizabeth, though much older than in 'Elizabeth', is bedecked and bejeweled beyond description, but has a sense of humor. She turns up at the theatre in the last scene to collect on the wager regarding whether the feeling of love could be adequately captured on the stage. In some surveys Gweyneth Palrow is the favorite, but I think that the actress that plays the lead role in Elizabeth has more of an opportunity to display a wider range of acting talent, and does throughout that film. It was kind of fun to see Joseph Innes in both films' title roles. He is a good actor.",10,0,0,15 February 1999
Elizabeth," Does something happen to the human race when it crosses the Atlantic that prevents a woman from governing?
","I guess there can be good government by women. In the modern day, it seems terribly strange to have all those queens ruling supreme battling each other. One wonders, if there had been countries on this side of the Atlantic would there have been female presidents governing here back then? Does something happen to the human race, when in crosses the Atlantic that precludes women from ruling?This movie is 'as good as any of its kind', as you'll find. Never having been a history buff, and preferring almost any other topic for a film, I was completely involved. Although the plot is simple, the film does keep one's attention with an excellent pace and breathtaking shots. The acting is excellent. Queen is outstanding. The costumes and scenery are fine. In a word, an excellent movie!Fanny Ardant, is good as the other queen and makes Elizabeth's queen look like the virgin queen.",10,0,1,13 February 1999
The Shining," A movie in a class by itself. A great horror film... but so much more.
","What a great work this is. How frightening! As a horror film this was extremely successful. But this of course is a much deeper film. This is a film about alcoholism; about child abuse; about domestic violence; and about 'the shining'. One feels strange about thinking of Jack as the victim in this film.Jack was not obviously a great writer. All he could come up with was, 'All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy'. He continued to type it on hundreds of pages, so that his wife would think that he was making progress with his book.Jack was subject to 'the shining' of the negro caretaker? That most proper, level headed negro, with the picture of the hot mamma in his room. Jack continuously hallucinated. Jack's son also hallucinated talking apparently to himself constantly. He thought he was talking to a little 'imaginary' friend. Jack had probably been involved with the child protection state agency before, when he hurt the boy's arm while drinking. Wendy may have called them herself.Truly a great film. Jack Nicholson's nonsensical movies are often quite meaty for the thinking person.",10,0,1,15 February 1999
Good Will Hunting," Detestable film about the strange people with brains.
","Don't spend the entire time while you read this review catching my mistakes and defaming me. It won't change anything. I have an IQ of 140. Not extraordinary, but not so bad either. This is how intelligent people are represented in our society. Every film one sees about this subject touts the virtues of the retard, and deprecates and misrepresents the smart. The ultimate example of this stuff, The Mighty, last year's film starring Sharon Stone tells the story of her son (in the movie), who is a sickly boy who will soon outgrow his bones. His organ will be too large for the space between the bones and he'll die. And he does. The only mitigating factor is that he meets a boy his age who is all muscle and no brains. Together with this boy Stone's son can get about. It's like the old joke 'Well, I'm the bum whole and if I shut down operations, you'll all be in torture, including you stupid brain! This movie Good Will Hunting is like so many movies from the kind of people who have given us things like child protection services, repressed memories suits, the abuse excuse in court, etc. America lives in an orgy of equalization, destroying everything and anything that looks better, let along outstanding. In a word intelligent people are all inbalanced and a constant problem. Only a mildly retarded social worker can help them.",1,15,37,14 February 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Life is beautfiul without retarded games that powerful lunatics force us to play.
","I dislike everything in this movie. I hate the story! Some game! As if survival were not difficult enought without the extra added torture that those who command us impose. Those characters should not have had to use up their lives playing that retarded game. Mental patients belong in asylums, not in power. I guess as a homage to good fathers, the movie is somewhat more tolerable. Many children of families with limited means grow up thinking that they are first class citizens thanks to protective fathers that sacrifice to give them that impression. But why should dad have to sacrifice so much?It's a silly movie. I guess they are running out of angles to examine the holocaust from. I know eventually this will happen. It has to.The movie itself is a competent offering. I thought the first ten, fifteen minutes were intolerably boring. It becomes more entertaining with the visually stunning party and street scenes. It certainly doesn't offer much hope for the Guidos of this world. I don't see any reason to nominate this film for Best  Picture.",6,4,10,18 February 1999
Psycho," I've always wanted to say this.
",I thought the ending was poorly rendered in comparison to the rest of the film. The ending is sometimes laughable if you are in the right mood. The rest of the film couldn't be better though. I think most people remember the shower scene vividly. But Janet Leigh is great as the thief. It's her movie as much as his.,8,0,0,15 February 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," A movie that I despised.
","Why this actrees, so lovely, and so good, insists on making such dogs, I'll never know. This is a sick film. What is it about? I don't know. It's just a revolting film. Is it missing a piece? Her movies, both as an actrees and a director, seem to be missing essential pieces. I always feel like there is much interesting ado, but then in the end about nothing.",1,14,63,15 February 1999
Blade Runner," What a wonderful world this will be.
","The replicants are everywhere, stealing everything. One's own memories, one's own life. And they are synthetic! Oh no! The future's here. They don't put you under hypnosis. They don't have a dosier. They just keep listening to you, appropriate your life and spice to taste. The replicant in this film looks Hispanic. I liked this film a lot. But I hope someone delivers a better future than the one the film portrays.",10,0,1,15 February 1999
The Godfather," Number one movie? It's madness I tell you... madness.
","I'm voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same. I have nothing against Italians, the Mafia or any of the principals, but best film ever? Never. It was an entertaining film, which displayed some rather ridiculous acting, in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the Italians. I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected.",1,42,121,14 February 1999
