10 Cloverfield Lane," Refereshing
","10 Cloverfield Lane is not a movie for everyone. Although my taste generally does not include bizarre movies like this, it was a refreshing experience all the same. It is different from most of the other movies I watch and the only other movie beating it in on my bizarre scale was No Country for Old Men. It actually challenged my opinions of movies. The mindset that Michelle(Ms.Winstead) that Michelle embodies is masterfully done. One can many a times predict her actions and that's actually a good thing, providing us with a nearness to the character that one frequently comes across in movies of the modern times.",8,3,4,15 July 2016
