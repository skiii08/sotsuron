The Monuments Men," Would Recommend: An Interesting History Lesson
","The Monuments Men brought together a great story with a great cast, but lacked anything else. I believe the only reason someone would watch it is because of either the cast or the story (that is the reason I watched it). Interesting enough to keep my attention throughout the whole movie, but that is only carried by the story which I feel was a pretty safe story not to mess up. Even this adequate portrayal of what happened during this WWII art mission flick was enough to keep me on my seat. I would recommend it to people, but only because, I believe other people would be interested in what happened and possibly to see a stellar cast make you chuckle a bit.I was very impressed with Cate Blanchett's portrayal of a french art curator. I thought her accent was impeccable and her sass and attitude of her character (Claire Simone) was a joy to watch. I felt the other actors performed like characters they had played before, very predictable but I wouldn't say boring. They as were expected, which, for actors of their stature is not bad.Overall this film felt like an interesting history lesson with an unnecessarily overqualified cast. I felt it missed a few of the marks in some of the more emotional scenes and maybe could have upped the stakes a bit in regards to having a more stand out villain. But the story was amazing and even a few days after I have watched it, I still think about it. So I would recommend it, not because it is a great movie, but because it is a great story.",8,0,2,6 April 2020
