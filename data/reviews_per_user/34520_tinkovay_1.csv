Source Code," This is a stolen plot
","This is such a disgrace, plot entirely stolen from a Japanese animation: Steins Gate, which was an excellent story, its really hard to make something really crap of it, but its still a disgrace.Disney already did this by stealing Hayao Miyazaki's story and released as 'Epic' with different characters, different names but practically the script is 90% same.Well it obviously was a precedent, this movie also shows US film makers don't give a crap about others property, as long not too many knows its source.People cant seem to understand, American film industry is dead, trying to remake other people's stories wont make the US creators any better.But well, Pacific rim seems to go for success too, while again they use a stolen plot too, of course from Japanese animation, because that seem to be trendy these days. Well they are indeed good source for stories, but not even putting any effort to change the story/script is just pathetic.Screw you Hollywood, just go down in the sink already.Well, the chances this will be passing submission are really slim XD",1,6,11,14 August 2013
