Minority Report," too far fetched
","Come on, this movie is so out of whack someone must have been on crack when they wrote it. Seeing murders in the future in the future, hogwash, and a lady that raises hybrid plants that move. Give me a break. And mechanical spiders that read peoples eyes. But they still have guns instead of phasers. The matrix was a little bit deep but this one takes the cake. They keep these 'precogs' submerged in electronic milk,,, does it ever go bad? Flying cop transporters and cars that climb buildings and on-ramps. They really pulled out all the stops in writing this movie and seems like they went a little bit too far. This movie wasn't worth the money for the rental fee for me and I'll look for something a little more believable next time.",1,6,11,31 December 2005
