Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat! Funny and alarming!
","Jagshemash! Here a come film review to you! OK, OK, let us leave the comedy mimicking of a central-Asian nitwit to the man who does it best: Sacha Baron Cohen. In his second feature outing following the regrettable 'Ali G Indahouse', Baron Cohen brings another of his comic creations to the screen in Borat, a riotously funny mixture of bigotry, buffoonery and bad taste.Where Ali G failed back 2002 by taking the Staines legend out of his usual chat show set-up and surrounded him with fictional characters, Borat succeeds by retaining the formula that made the show so ridiculously hilarious: making real people look silly. What little plot the movie has (Borat sent to the 'US and A' to learn cultural lessons for Kazakhstan government) is made up for by the sheer amount of gut-busting laughs. As Borat, a naive journalist with tremendously backward views on matters of sex, religion and race, makes his way across the US, his confrontations with the American public, be they real or staged, cannot help but entertain.We get anti-semitic jokes, naked man wrestling, a bear in an ice cream van and so much more it would be rude to spoil your fun. Some conservatives have decried the film as offensive and crude but Baron Cohen is doing something more than mere gross-out humor; revealing that racial bigotry and deep-rooted sexist beliefs can still be found not only in Borat's fictional 'Kazakhstan' but in the very real, United States of America.",9,4,12,3 November 2006
Hot Fuzz," Fuzztastic!
","The Shaun of the Dead team are back with another quote-tastic homage to another much loved cinema genre. Last time round zombies were given the romantic comedy spin. This time we see straight-laced, city cop, Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg) transferred out to the country to team up alongside the lovable, well meaning Constable Danny Butterman (Frost) in this gloriously hilarious action-comedy romp.As in 'Shaun', where such classics as the 'Dawn of the Dead' trilogy were regularly referenced, here we find the boys nodding their heads towards such pure popcorn classics as 'Bad Boys II' and 'Point Break'. Ridiculously overblown explosions and cheesy one-liners are all present and correct but this is not a simple mickey-take. Pegg (who also co-wrote the screenplay) and Frost obviously have a loving affection for the genre and considering the budget some of the more complex action sequences are handled expertly.However, the film could be considered slightly overlong for a comedy with a relatively weak plot and it does take a little while for the gags to start flowing. The distinctly British humor that you'll be quoting for weeks and the great on screen chemistry between Pegg and Frost carry the picture and dismiss any minor quibbles, ensuring Hot Fuzz will turn out to be one of the funniest, most inventive comedies of 2007. Oh, and Timothy Dalton's in it if that's not already enough!",9,1,3,23 February 2007
Constantine," A solid genre picture for a mainstream audience
","CONSTANTINE (2005) Dir. Francis Lawrence 'Hell wants him. Heaven won't take him. Earth needs him.' Starring: Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weiz, Djimon Honsou, Tilda Swinton, Shia La Beouf.In a world, split into three parallel universes; heaven, hell and earth, John Constantine (Reeves) is a bad-ass, chain smoking, exorcist ridding the world of half-breeds (half human, half angel or demon) in order to assure safe passage into heaven.There is no denying that like much of Hollywood's recent output, the film is a visual feast, including mouth-watering set-pieces involving Constantines trip to hell and numerous face-offs with a wide range of strange and interesting creatures. Reeves goes about the film without ever moving out of second gear in a performance suggesting he has the emotional range of a pea. Weiz is steady and assured but never sparkling as the sister of a suicide victim, unsure of whether she is in hell or not.The plot, while interesting gets too tangled up in itself over the 122 minutes, heaping complication on complication as Constantine and Detective Dodson (Weiz) help prevent the world from falling into the hands of an exceedingly camp devil (Peter Stormare). Certain points are not concluded such as the apparent disappearance of the devil's son and the fact that the devil has brown sticky tar on his feet.Though, the script could do with some work to flesh out the paper-thin characters, the premise is intriguing enough, helped by dazzling visuals and Keanu's star-power, to give a genre picture a chance with a mainstream audience.VERDICT: 3/5",6,0,3,23 March 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Echo's of Independence Day
","I bet Emmerich and chums thought they had hit the jackpot when they decided to make a film on global warming: the first to do so to my knowledge. And, it is the idea or the notion of these terrible events actually occurring, in our own life times that keep you glued to the screen in this interesting, special effects driven thriller.It really is a tale of two films; the first and the second half. The first half builds up the tension with the use of news reports, political conferences and some amazing special effects (the tornadoes in L.A). It feels like Independence Day, Emmerichs other blockbuster in the way that it cranks up the tension to such a degree that it can only leave you disappointed with the climax. I'm not saying however that the second half, Jack Hall (Quaid) going off to rescue his son (Gyllenhaal), is a load of rubbish but after the engrossing and possibly overlong introduction its a bit of a let down.The recuse mission is to short. There are not enough thrills and spills to make it exciting enough; Jack finds his son to easily and the relationship between Sam (Gyllenhaal) and Laura (Rossum) is not developed enough to be believable.In conclusion we have solid performances all round with no-one particularly excelling in their roles (Rossum is charmingly sweet none the less) and a strong background story (aided by amazing CGI work) coupled with weak human drama. Emmerich's given use another slice of popcorn cinema but like Independence Day its a film of two halves.Bernard L Black gives it: 7/10 for a strong and compelling first and second act supported by jaw dropping CGI storms and tornadoes. The third act just didn't have enough action and the emotional payoff the first two deserved.",8,0,0,27 May 2004
The Departed," Scorsese back where he belongs
","It's refreshing to see three of American cinema's biggest names return to something like top form. Since Goodfellas, Scorsese, Hollywood's crime lord, has seen switches in genre proved unsuccessful at the box office and amongst critics: period pieces, Kundun, Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Damon and Di Caprio also make searing returns to form, the former finally coming out of the shadow of that infernal puppet in Team America (remember he wrote Good Will Hunting) in this thrilling Boston crime epic from the master of the genre.A remake of the Hong-Kong 2002 thriller, Infernal Affairs, The Departed sees the divide between both sides of the law blur as an all-star Hollywood cast swear, kill and even butcher their way through the complexities of life in the Boston-Irish mafia. There are rats on both sides and no one can be sure who has the sharpest teeth until Scorsese pulls back the curtain for his tense, seat-gripping finale.This is an 18 certificate movie so: vulgar profanity. Check. Lots of blood. Check. And Jack Nicholson's sublime gangland boss hitting on an underage girl asking if she'd got her period yet. Check. It sounds wrong but trust me; this is comedy but damn is it dark.The movie has is problems: it's a 'bum-number' i.e. a little long for some tastes and female character who becomes involves with Di Caprio and Damon feels at times somewhat inconsequential but these are very small needles in a gloriously entertaining haystack.In a nutshell: Awesome! The most entertaining picture this year. Not for the faint hearted but if you loved Goodfellas, if you love Scorsese you will not be disappointed.",9,1,2,21 October 2006
