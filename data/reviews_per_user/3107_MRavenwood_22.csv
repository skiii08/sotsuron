Black Swan," I Thought It Would Be Depressing, but It's Not
","I avoided this at the box office first-run. I just watched it (9/2012) on HBO. It is is very well made. The main reason I am writing this review is not only to let people know that it's interesting and moves along well. It's nothing like I thought it would be. More importantly, I have seen the film characterized in a number of ways in other reviews or summaries. There seems to be a consistent pattern of declarative statements being made about characters in the film in areas where the movie is ambiguous. One of the reasons I LIKE the film is because you can't be sure where reality ends and Nina's drug/pressure-induced imaginings begin. Mila Kunis's character of Lily is key in this area of uncertainty I am describing, but certainly not the only one. The thematic touchstone of people encouraging Nina to 'Lose(her)self' sets the stage for this psychotic metamorphosis.",7,1,4,4 September 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Link to the Past, a Revival of Style
","There are so many ways in which this film is perfect, most notably is the brilliant re-packaging of old-school action and war films; away from the James-Bond style of the late 60s; away from the Cold-War suspense and intrigue. One of the most endearing features of the picture is that the movie opens with the main character,Indiana Jones' at the close of his current adventure. The technique generates an immediate sense of personal history and intimacy with the main character, and in effect, serves the audience dessert twice.The atmosphere of equal parts impending danger and chronic screw ups is set right from the start, with a lit-fuse pace throughout the movie. Every scene is tight. The sound, the lighting, the dialog,the music, the performances. Every character actor is well-chosen. So many ingredients to enjoy: adventure, humor, mysterious locations, romance, explosions. Only a Nazi could not enjoy this film!",10,15,28,11 November 2005
A Bridge Too Far," Competes with 'The Great Escape' for 'Best All-Star Cast'
","Many of the World War II films contemporary to the War are finely acted, or full of carefree sing-and-dance numbers. Un-bitter pieces with clear conflicts and villains. This film is released in 1977...the same year Star Wars came out - and allows for a different mood. Having sufficient distance from the World War, with two other American conflicts in between, a more ambiguous view of both the Allies and the Axis powers emerges. Not that the Nazis are suddenly good guys, but they have their problems too.The plot is influenced by the point of view of all of those having to take orders from above and follow those orders to their best ability. Even when they know failure is more likely than not, even though 'what was supposed to happen' didn't happen and now they have to improvise, not only to save themselves, but to save the other guys that are counting on them.To my eye, this film combines old-school film-making, real craftsmanship in both scale and detail, while navigating the plot's tightrope of tough decisions and lucky breaks. Beautifully illustrated for both the Good Guys and the Bad Guys is the notion that the men in the field suffer when commanders have lost situational awareness. A degree of satisfaction may be removed for some viewers due to the absence of a clear hero,winner, or lesson learned. All-star casts don't always 'work' but this one does and I would argue it contends with The Great Escape just on that particular point. Jamming all those jewels into one setting sometimes makes for gaudiness, more than elegance. Not so for either film! Like a good chocolate chip cookie, with chips in every bite, there is star power enough in every scene to make each worthwhile to consume, just on performances alone.",8,1,1,1 July 2006
The Prestige," There is Beauty in Misdirection
","It is rare for Hollywood movies to engross a real adult in a film, but this one succeeds. Certainly there are magic tricks, but magic is really just the gimmick that allows this fascinating tale of an all-consuming competition for stage dominance between two master magicians to unfold.And there's more magic behind the individual amazing performances. Not only do the actors convince the audience of their sincerity in the performance of their role, but nearly every one is performing their role in a foreign accent. Hugh Jackman is Australian putting on a fine American sound. Christian Bale is Welsh providing an impressive London street sound.There will be a need to see the film a second time, to see how cleverly the screenplay was written. Beautiful work. The overall effect is that you are watching a mystery, romance, suspense movie all at once. Great costumes, beautiful look and feel to the piece. Fabulous acting. A really well-cast film masterfully achieved.",10,3,5,7 March 2008
Crash," What Foreigners Think Happens in Los Angeles but Doesn't
","The performances are really strong especially in the face of dialog that has to remind the actors of Days of Our Lives more than any day in their real lives. Every single person in every scene is a racist and/or a bad guy. Los Angeles is a very racially tolerant place (if you don't think so, I invite you to travel anywhere else and see how much you know about racial tolerance). You would be considered a nut case for making comments in public the way many of the characters do. Some people may make comments in private to friends, but the friends would consider them outside the mainstream for many of the remarks made in this film. Another example is with LAPD, where officers are thought of as under-supervised and half crooked. But even LAPD is portrayed in an unbelievable way. Leave aside that LAPD wouldn't patrol with 2 guys if they were in the area shown in the movie, it would be one, and they would not be both white if it were two. More to the point, if an LAPD officer were going to grope a girl he had just stopped, it would be anyone but the character in question. Officers would be, if anything, afraid of touching a black female if she were a member of the media especially. A mere accusation from such a person would trigger 3 investigations: internal LAPD, FBI for civil rights violations, and the news media. LAPD officers who have been arrested in the past show a pattern of abuse of power, but it's against gang members and drug dealers who have no interest in calling the police to report that their illegally obtained cash has been stolen along with the drugs they've been selling. If the filmmakers had thought to use that, it would have been more interesting and damning of LAPD than anything they presented. The movie is just asinine and anyone who takes it seriously is being taken for a ride.",6,6,8,3 April 2006
Forrest Gump," A Classic About Simplicity and Fulfillment
","The craftsmanship in this movie is not that it has a good message, it's that it tells a good story and the good messages keep coming. These messages are so universal, it would be difficult to find someone who can watch this film without shedding a tear.Forrest Gump is a none-too-bright Southerner whose positive attitude, uncomplicated life, and honest application of hard work yield for him a soap-opera-like chain of incredible success. Instead of achieving one historically significant and newsworthy goal, he achieves every major definition of success in Western Culture, except for the one he wants: the love of 'his girl', Jenny. While he is off winning high honors, getting photographed on both television and magazines, Jenny leads the life of The Prodigal; boozing it up and partying down. It's always empty and disappointing to her.For all his colossal successes, Forrest himself winds up unsure of himself because he knows he his not smart. The mutual dissatisfactions of incredible success and incredible failure with no one to share it with lead the two back together for a familiar friendship. An interesting resolution to the story fulfills the 'what's missing' in each of their lives.Wall-to-wall solid performances. Tightly cut together. Incredible special effects. Rich art direction for the 60's and 70's flashbacks. Especially keep an eye out for all the TVs, the iconic talisman of the film. Most appropriate/appreciated by 15 years old and up.",10,0,2,24 September 2006
The Italian Job," Better Plot than 1960's version - And shows off Minis Again
","I liked it that the film starts off at a modern pace, establishes characters, and gets moving right away. The story unfolds at a friendly speed with a few interesting features thrown in, including meaningful dialogue between a man and a woman that is not a lame seduction scene. Sometimes, an all-star cast becomes frustrated by the inability of big stars to work unselfishly as an ensemble, but this film provides a satisfying exception and example of how it can be done right. The 1969 Caine version has little to offer in the way of complications and subplots, which this update rectifies with flair, while maintaining an excellent standard in unique car chase elements. It is an action flick, however, and does play a little loose with scientific verities, such as how long a person can survive at a low body temperature.",8,0,1,3 February 2008
Cast Away," Practically a one-man show
","I won't say that this is a 'desert island' favorite, this is about the last thing you want to see if you got stranded! It's really a major accomplishment for the director Zemekis and Hanks making the film seem vast and isolated without bogging down. If Forest Gump didn't convince you that Tom Hanks is one of the most skilled and credible actors in modern history, if not of all time, then you need to watch this picture to set you straight. Little details build up in this film to add to the realism. The story involves Hanks' as a corporate worker-bee becoming stranded on a small island in the Pacific. The depiction of his day-to-day survival and acceptance of circumstances with occasional moments of great learning prove a crucial element in the pacing of the film. His gradual mastery over his environment also increases the audience's sense of participation in the drama. He learns how to help himself survive.Sure, it's a low-energy emotional performance for most of the picture, but the weight of the film is all on Hanks and the shoot looks pretty physical. In fact, they shot part of the film and then went back a year later, giving Hanks enough time to drop weight to look sufficiently half-starved.The audience can clearly see his early mistakes in prioritizing his survival tools on the island. His delay in learning to build a signal fire costs him dearly, like his poor priorities in 'real' life cost him. The film is a rewarding survival story and comment on modern life. If nothing else, this film encourages the examination of your life and may make you want to learn how to build a fire or carry a multi-tool with you at all times.",9,1,2,8 October 2006
American Beauty," Superb Acting - Intense Drama
","In many ways this movie is dark, but ultimately a bittersweet story. It seems to be about Maintaining Appearances within what the American culture calls 'the Rat Race'. The endless cycle of fighting to survive and achieve. Striving to be excellent, unique, 'exceptional' and recognized for being so. And, as the term implies, remaining unsatisfied. 'The office' and High School are the two theatres in which the characters inter-twine to meet their challenges.The film focuses on four core characters: A husband and wife, their daughter and her 'weird' boyfriend, plus the boyfriend's militant father and her gorgeous girlfriend from school. Simultaneous to the strivings for success is examination of the drive to find someone to care about and who loves the REAL you. It isn't a 'happy' film, but it points out some possible outcomes on the way to striving for happiness.There are very dramatic and violent scenes and 'amplified' characters that jam a lot of conflict and revelation into the conclusion of the film. There is no 'Hollywood ending', but there is resolution.As far as a parental guide, I would say it's too thematically sophisticated to be appreciated fully by children under 17. The violence and emotional turmoil is too real and not cartoon-y for kids of an impressionable age. Not for the G-rated family! There is open drug use, non-marital sex scenes, implied homosexual sex, strong language, violence, and disturbing situations. But it's a great movie!",8,1,2,1 February 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Swedish Version is Darker and More Violent... but
","Swedish Version is Darker and More Violent... but don't kid yourself, the American film *clearly* required a serious edit to pull it under an X rating for violence alone. I'm not put off by the way the filmmakers have presented this material; it is tasteful and not gratuitous. Sensitive persons will be bothered by the violence and implied violence against humans and animals, however. The Swedish version has better costuming for Lisbeth, but it's easier to work with the romantic notion of Daniel Craig's Blomkvist. Most importantly, the American ending leaves in a scene that clearly demonstrates Lisbeth's emotional state. This becomes important for the subsequent stories. For the above two reasons alone, I would advise viewers to see the American version if they are only going to bother with one. On style, I prefer the grit and darkness of the Swedish version. It's more noirish. Absolutely not suitable for kids.",8,1,6,1 January 2012
Quantum of Solace," Garbage in Garbage Out
","If they'd started with a tight script, they might have ended up with a decent movie for Quantum of Solace. There clearly wasn't one, at least anywhere written down that I could tell. In addition to a half-baked revenge plot, which was absolutely impossible to follow - or care about, the camera work and edits are so... clinical and high-speed that the scenes don't evolve at the right pace. You can't care about anything because it's just one action sequence followed by a vague scene, which leads to another show down in another country. Bond is perpetually cold and gritty in this film and there's no dimension to him.But let's back up a bit and see if you agree with the ingredients to a Bond film 1. Exotic locations 2. 'M' 3. James Bond doing something he's not supposed to do. 4. Steamy hook-ups with at least two different women, usually only one becomes the love interest. 5. A black tie affair of some kind. 6. Fighting and chase sequences. 7. A villain that is trying to execute some complicated plan. 8. Felix Leighter 9. 'Q' 10. An opening 'preamble' that breaks into the main title (writhing girl silhouettes and guns and stuff) accompanied by the famous down the barrel view of Bond.Check marks on nearly all, except, disastrously, this film dispensed with the traditional opening sequence. The titles were a bunch of boring shots of sand and little animated Bonds running this way and that in the most unimaginative Bond main title in history. It lacked in both energy and information, and they got rid of the famous gun barrel device. That's like a birthday cake without frosting. They also had no love interest. Sure, there are two girls, but there's no chemistry or substance to the scenes. The first scene of the film starts off with M and Bond making reference to characters and events that happened in Casino Royale. If you didn't see Casino Royale, or see it recently, then I'm afraid you're stuck. On the other hand, I have Casino Royale practically memorized and I couldn't follow the intrigue of this picture. It involved oil and water, and an eco-plot but it just didn't play. Daniel Craig is not at fault. The film is poorly made. It doesn't cut together in a well-paced, cohesive way. So, if you're a Bond fan and want to see it despite its flaws, go to a matinée to lessen the blow. Frankly, you may still end up being disappointed and you could actually wait for the DVD.",4,2,6,15 November 2008
The Chorus," Bittersweet Tale of Hope, Teaching, and Bucking the System
","Too many people are afraid to see foreign language films - and it's a pity more people didn't get a chance to see this in the theatre. It's a great movie for anyone who has ever been changed by a teacher's efforts, or frustrated by an unjust system.Set in post-World War II France it's about a teacher who finds himself posted at a school for troubled boys. Although the corporal punishment is harsh, the boys don't seem to have any respect for the severe headmaster...nor anyone else. It is in this environment that the gentle Clement Mathieu arrives and struggles to find a way to break through to the boys and bring humanity back to the wild gaggle of youth.The film is well made and feels old fashioned and more leisurely paced from a far less 'sped-up' time. Not a 'feel good' movie and not a downer, more bittersweet, but well-worth the effort if you run across it.",10,1,1,26 September 2006
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Skillfully Made, Not Just a Bunch of Mindless Action
","It's not an intricate plot like a thriller, but it's also not a tedious chase film with no substance. Yet, it has the most brilliantly conceived and choreographed action gags, very much in line with what you would expect an animation writer to be exceptional at.The production values are high, but it's not just a bunch of mindless action and karate chopping thugs that bore you to tears; it has a story involving launch codes. It's a fun ride, wonderfully edited. Very hard to tell the real shots from the fake, except in one obvious visual effect scene, where I personally would have chosen to combine miniatures or models and combine it with CGI, instead of just going all-digital. Enagaging, without being unfamiliar or taxing. NOT a Cruise fan, but he does a nice job.Great cast including Anil Kapoor for you '24' fans, and Slumdog admirers. 'The girl' is played by the beautiful Paula Patton and what modern movie is made these days without Tom Wilkinson, who gets a day and a half's worth of work in as a D.C. poltical operator.I saw it in IMAX. Worth it!",9,3,7,22 December 2011
Gran Torino," Deliciously Politically Incorrect
","This movie feels like a cross between a modern film and 1970s-era Hollywood movie. Great acting, good story, and funny. Yet, it still is escapist entertainment and not a movie trying to sell you some philosophy. Very politically incorrect, which is refreshing without being a send-up. I won't give away any plot, but Eastwood plays a hard case, as you might expect. However, the supporting cast is pretty well drawn and has dimension that would be lacking in a run-of-the-mill revenge shoot-'em up. He gets a little push-back which keeps his character from being a cartoon. Clint Eastwood got some great performances out of these actors. You should start congratulating him now on his nomination for best director - there's no way it's not coming. The movie opened last weekend, but the 10p.m. showing tonight was sold out and we actually couldn't get a seat so we stood in the aisle rather than sit in the second row of seats. It was worth it to stand. Our whole audience laughed a lot and otherwise reacted, so the film 'plays' to a diverse group and wide range of ages, although it is rated R for language, gang violence, and the requisite 'adult themes'. On that subject if you are sensitive to course language, this film is not for you. Having said that, your kids or friends probably already talk this way, so if you really don't like hearing the F-word as it is used by modern kids, then steer clear of this one.",8,1,3,11 January 2009
Rules of Engagement," Oscar Winning Cast Can't Save the Silly Script
","Tommy Lee Jones and Ben Kingsly are Oscar winners. Samuel Jackson is an Oscar nominee,and Guy Pierce has many nominations and wins in his future. None of these actors, nor the excellent supporting cast can fix the confusion and unbelievability of this film. In fact, the whole point of the film is easily lost because the filmmakers deliberately keep the audience ignorant of what the main character,Col. Terry Childers sees in the battle that sets the whole story in motion.Meanwhile, a lot of plot development time is wasted on making sure the audience understands that the colonel, played by Samuel Jackson is tough and a good Marine, as is his buddy, Tommy Lee Jones. And, the continuity problems are so confusing that any viewer would lose the plot. (Begin spoiler)There is an important sequence which clearly shows kids in amongst a protesting crowd that is becoming more agitated. But later, there appear to be many score more wounded children than were ever established to be in the crowd in the first place AND with wounds that don't seem like they could have come from small arms fire.Leave aside completely that the Colonel is charged with murder and photos of the scene show that pretty much everyone was killed...so again, you are left to wonder who are all these 'surviving' wounded? (End spoiler) It would be worth the effort to just watch it for the acting, but it's pretty hard to get through. Basically, the whole thing suffers from trying to be plausible fiction, but failing in so many key areas that it falls dangerously near farce.",5,7,14,14 December 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Save some time: Read this Summary
","If you're the kind of person who has time to watch grass grow, please feel free to sit down and watch every moment of this film. If you're just doing a report on it, rent the DVD and print this summary so you can follow it along. It is sacrilegious to say this film is not the most amazing, perfect, beautiful film to ever have been made, so I won't say it... The effects are okay, and most hold up, but the sheer length of it is silly and the 'grooviness' and 'heavy' themes are not as interesting as people want to pretend. But then again, I was born after we landed on the moon. There's my review (Okay Space Odyssey lovers! There's your cue to click Not Helpful!!). Here's a summary: Opening Scene: 'pre-human' beings encounter a black rectangular Something-er-other known as 'The Monolith' and it transforms the primitives into tool-wielding smart guys.Act 1: Moon astronauts dig up The Monolith (40-feet below the surface of the Moon) and when sunlight hits the surface of it, it emits this horrible sound, which you the audience are supposed to figure out is a signal to the planet Jupiter (perhaps where the 'owners' of The Monolith live or want their messages forwarded to at any rate) So: The Monolith that made the Apes smart has been found in a place that only very smart humans could have gotten to. End Act 1.Act 2: Dave and Frank are now on their way to Jupiter. A lot of gee-whiz showing off of technical stuff follows. The on-board computer HAL 9000 fakes like there is a problem with a certain device. Dave and Frank who are 'awake' (the other astronauts are in hibernation) work together; one inside and the other outside (EVA: Extra-Vehicular-Activity) to fix the device. They both conclude that there is nothing wrong with it and are suspicious that HAL 9000 is full of it. They confer in what they think is private and tell each other frankly that HAL might have to be unplugged since he's gone wacky. Unbeknownst to either guy HAL can read their lips through the window of where they are talking and sees that they are going to deactivate his ass. So he tricks them into going outside into space. He kills Frank and locks Dave outside. While Dave figures out a way to get back inside the craft without his blood boiling, or him freezing to death (this sequence does kick butt, I have to admit)from exposure to space, HAL powers down the life support on the others in hibernation, killing them all. Once back inside, Dave immediately drops the powerful HAL down to Threat Level Zero. A video flickers on stating that the mission to Jupiter is secret and there is some freaky stuff going on there.ACT 3: Dave encounters The Monolith floating around out by Jupiter. He goes on some looooooooonnggggg ride through a bunch of lights and comes out very aged at the end in a weird 'house.' He turns and sees himself even older, then older still. Then, reaching out from his death bed, he sees The Monolith. Which 'renews' him as a fetus. The end.",5,4,9,10 February 2006
August Rush," Very Disappointing - Missable, Daft, Chick Movie (and I'm a Chick!)
","I am writing this as an alternate viewpoint to the praise heaped on this film over these pages. Bottom line, the film is inoffensive, but really not very substantive entertainment-wise or message-wise. It starts with a CGI treatment of a wheat field on the opening credits, which looks distractingly silly. It weakly conveys that the main character (a boy named Evan Taylor) believes he has some kind of control over the field, but it falls short of the intended correlation to his sensation of 'music everywhere' which is better illustrated later in the film. The story set up is VERY slow and heavy-handed in establishing Evan's beliefs about one day finding his parents. Only half way through the film does there begin to be any appreciable progress with regard to the plot. Sure, things happen to the characters, but nothing really connects the audience to their emotion. On the positive side, Robin Williams appears in this film in a role that is suited for him and that he plays in a restrained and powerful way. His character is the least trite, although you can somewhat 'see him coming' from the moment he enters. Another highlight is the character of 'Arthur X' a child musician who basically drives the plot forward all on his own for most of the second act. One senses that this actor Leon G. Thomas is capable of much more than the 'official black ghetto kid' dialog he is given. Terrence Howard turns in an elegant performance with his portrayal of a caring social worker. Overall, the film doesn't require a *little* imagination or suspension of disbelief, it requires whole re-calibrations of reality from scene to scene. Not that you would think it's true-to-life, but it doesn't even make sense within its own parameters. Lastly, the music is all over the place thematically, stylistically and not cohesively or meaningfully - although there are some great players performing. An interesting concept for a film, but I found nothing to take away from it. If you want to see a feel-good film in this genre done correctly, check out Serendipity.",3,26,45,27 December 2007
The Good Shepherd," Good Drama, Spy Movie, and Life Examination
","What this movie focuses on continually changes and unfolds, but centrally it's about choices; how all of us try to make decisions and go with what will work best. Still, there will be things you didn't do right. It's about regrets, mistakes, weakness, purity, and deception.The acting is all top notch and the direction (by Robert DiNiro,) who clearly has given the players the vibe he wants out of each scene, is excellent. The tone of the film is consistently melancholy and distanced, to convey the heaviness of the pervasive secret world of espionage in which Edward, the main character (Matt Damon) lives. There are a lot of shadows used in this film, a symbol of the hidden and unearthliness of the 'spooks' who glide through their lives carefully plotting and counter-plotting through wars, and around wars. The time-line of the piece sea-saws between past and present history - which is sometimes difficult to track - but works itself out without much effort on the viewer's part.This film is not for everyone. It's not glossy, sexy, or action-packed. It's a long investment time-wise, but the pacing works. If you are indulgent in allowing the plot to unfold, and are not requiring a film with car chases, then this film offers a story that moves and is not overly cerebral with dialogue that's not sleepy. It's easy enough to follow and complicated enough to seem evolved from real life. This film is well-crafted and employs rich vintage colors to tell an interesting story through characters that are multi-dimensional and worth caring about. If you view the bonus material on the DVD, you will be treated to an entire sub-plot that intensifies the theme of the film. Really, for spy movie enthusiasts a must-see, and for others a solid film worth investing in.",10,1,2,4 March 2008
Casino Royale," Opening credits to Final Frame - You're 'In' the movie
","The opening credits for Bond movies, long famous for the writhing women and cutting-edge animation technique, gets a spiffy update to signal a new era of Bond that focuses more on the Cold War spy/man of action angle, rather than the impossibly infallible lady killer...not that he doesn't manage to allure. The chase scenes are still present, but not necessarily done in a car with a requisite fruit cart tipping over in the open air market. The action is very fast and you'll burn calories just watching this extremely physical role unfold at the speed it does. Casino Royale is actually the first of Ian Flemmings novels and introduces the character to the world, but the original 60's movie made of it was a send-up of spy movies and a 'counter' to the overwhelming success of the devil-may-care MI-6 agent previously portrayed by Sean Connery. Since the series has outlived all the book titles and certainly its authors, it makes sense to re-start the character from the beginning. Introduce how he got his 'double-oh' designation, his Astin Martin, how he developed his drinking preferences, and how his heart was forever broken. He is thus rebuilt in the form of Daniel Craig,an actor who looks neither brooding nor suave on the poster, but gets it done on screen. The wry humor traditionally present in the films is still present but (mercifully!) the horrible puns and the incongruously over-the-top daftness of the jokes appears to have been removed. The only detraction I can make from the movie is the persistence of the product placement in the script here and there. Most egregious would be the Omega (Oh-mee-guh? Do the Brits pronounce this brand name this way?) A necessary evil, and a tolerable one in film-making of this magnitude. I paid $10.50 to see it in a Los Angeles theatre and I have every intention of seeing it again. (So many movies look so LAME these days, I usually don't bother seeing them even once...)Technical note: the camera work is amazing. The editing of the construction site scene alone is just thrilling. How many cameras it must have taken to get some of these scenes accomplished, I cannot guess.",9,3,7,19 November 2006
Flight," Happy to see the Issue Adressed, but this is not a Classic
","Sure, pilots have big egos - and when it comes to portraying a bad-boy with over-blown self confidence, Denzel Washington always seems to fit the bill. The drawback is, that when it comes to realism this film can't hold a candle to Lost Weekend - a very believable tale of an alcoholic who decides to turn over a new leaf when he meets a woman worth quitting for, only to prove to himself a hopelessly addicted alcoholic who CAN'T quit. 'Flight' shows the can't-quit stuggle, but never shows an ounce of the self-loathing that alcoholics feel when they fail at serious areas of performance. The ending is a farce and totally unconvincing, although it's dramatic. I would have preferred Chris Cooper or Ed Harris in this leading role and made the character FAR more emotionally unstable in order to make the 'redemptive' ending work. I did not find the ending believable in any way. So. GOOD movie? Yes... brilliant or classic? Not so much.",5,0,1,29 January 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Eff-word laced, fist festival for British 10-year-old Boys.
","You cannot convince me they are not paying people to give this terrible film high ratings on the internet. People gave it 10s??? It is unwatchable. I don't worry about foul language for the most part, but a lot of eff-words in a movie clearly targeted at 10-12 year-old boys is a bit much. It was just plain retarded from the get-go and the performances from the actors was not even remotely up to snuff. And I love Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth - I figured, 'How can you go wrong?' I truly can't figure out who the audience is for this. Garbage. Total waste of $11 bucks. Wouldn't have even watched it free on the internet.",2,74,149,14 February 2015
Atonement," I Was Not Enthralled
","Other than the lush scenery and ingenious photography, I see no specialness in this film. Set in pre-World War II England, the story is about a girl bearing false witness and how pettiness can ruin the lives of many. The plot is revealed in stages, showing sequences through the eyes of one character, then another, divulging important facts in the second viewing. At times, the vignettes play out of chronological order so that the audience is deliberately in the dark as to when the events are taking place. I enjoyed this technique and it does add 'punch' to the overall piece. It seems that the movie is aimed at, and essentially about, the inner life of immature females and their writing and re-writing of scripts in their head. On every level this film feels like a chick film based on a romance novel. I should add at this point that the most shining example of great acting in the film is achieved by Juno Temple as a supporting, but pivotal character named Lola.I did not feel a strong reason for the two main characters Cecilia (Kneightly) and Robbie (McEvoy) to love each other. Erotic thoughts are inadvertently revealed and suddenly, there is lasting love? It didn't work for me. The ending is supposed to be bittersweet, but I just thought it made the title seem silly. I'm avoiding spoilers here, but the actions taken by Briony offer none of the redemptive qualities of atonement. There are no scenes where she finally grows up and drops her infatuation with her own inner drama. Her attempts to orchestrate lives and feelings in real life as she can on the page, are never tamed. No, I'm afraid this film fell well below expectations for me both as a love story and as a film about Atonement.",6,3,6,29 March 2008
