Black Swan," engrossing
","Few films spark such heated debates as this one. Being able to do just that is a good sign in itself. Opinions here vary from hate, disgust and accusations of misogyny to awe-inspiring and magnificent. Well, at least it does not leave you indifferent. You can argue that we have seen it all before and it reminds you of this and that. True as it may be, it does not flaw the film. If it is an old story, it is craftily reinvented and very well illustrated. The engrossing depiction of passion as inspiring but consuming and often destructive force is, to my mind, what makes 'Black Swan' worth your time. The acting is more than good and the dark atmosphere is definitely to my liking. Do not be put off by negative reviews, just go and see it. Most films out there are mindless crap, overloaded with CGI or as shallow as can be. Be sure this one stands out, in the good sense.",8,1,7,6 January 2011
