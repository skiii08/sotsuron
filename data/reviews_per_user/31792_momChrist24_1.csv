It," Good movie but I'm a little angry....
","I loved the original IT. This version was better than I had expected. However, I thought it would cover all that the original did. Especially since I heard that this was a 'revisit'. I was upset that it did not depict their return. Is there going to be a 2???? Because this left something lacking for me. I have been a Stephen King fan for many years, and have even listened to and read some of what he wrote under Richard Bachman. I did like that this went a little more by the book though. The movie still missed something for me.",6,0,6,23 September 2017
