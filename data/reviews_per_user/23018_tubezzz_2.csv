10 Cloverfield Lane," Bad Bad Bad
","The story unfolds way too fast for it to be a real thriller. the characters are flat and not relatable. If there was any shred of hope for this movie, the ludicrous ending was the final nail in the coffin. Avoid at all costs.",1,2,3,18 November 2017
Logan," Schindler's list was upbeat compared this this
","Incredibly bleak and depressing.I feel for the poor souls who actually had to sit through this painful experience in a movie theater.It felt like they really wanted the the viewers to sympathize with Logan by making us share his agonizing and doomed existence. well it worked. 20 minutes into this thing and i wanted to off myself. Xavier is dying, Logan is dying. everyone around them is dying. all the mutants have vanished (I still don't know why or how) so they're all alone. Now normally if a movie is so depressing you'd expect some serious drama to back it up. well, the first problem is, the film goes out of its way to remind you that 'this can not end well', so there's no hope, and there's no suspense - since we know the main characters are already doomed. yes there are those mutant kids we can root for, but we hardly get to know them, and the little girl is so feral that i didn't care for her either. the 'eleven' girl from 'Stranger Things' (Millie Bobby Brown) plays the same role only x10 times better. The other issue i had with the movie is the lack of 'journey' (character development/progression). the characters just suffer until they die. at the beginning of the film Logan is an angry, withered terminal patient, and Xavier is a dying shell of a man. both characters stay mostly true to that description for the remainder of the film. Hugh Jackson goes out of his way to show us he doesn't give a damn. so much so that it was very difficult for me to believe that he's actually willing to fight for the sake of Laura or the other kids. why doesn't he just kill himself already?Last but not least, the action scenes: those were incredibly repetitive. Logan and Laura slice and dice through a never ending supply of henchmen. an incredibly mind numbing experience. I'm not huge superhero fan. but i got to watch all of the X-men movies and found them to be quite entertaining if nothing else. 'Logan' has nothing to do with any of those. it's a stand-alone requiem for fun.",3,4,8,23 November 2017
