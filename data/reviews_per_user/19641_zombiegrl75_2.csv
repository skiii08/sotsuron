Hereditary," So much potential, but it misses the mark
","This honestly started out as being one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. But they missed the mark with the ending. When the mom asked her husband to burn the book, I imagined her flailing about like she was fighting an invisible fire, and that's when the auidence would've gone 'whoa, she was actually insane.' The son could've been imagining everything too. Instead we got a B-movie version of Rosemary's Baby that felt totally off. Major props to Toni Collete, though. I have yet to see her acting not blow me away. Her grieving scenes were incredibly had to watch as a mother.",6,0,1,30 July 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Great movie if you are a big fan of the books!
","Okay, I am 35 and a huge fan of the books. I agree the acting still isn't the greatest but for anyone wanting the movies to mirror the books, like myself, this was a great film. Kristen Stewart has always bothered me but I think she is getting better and becoming a more believable Bella, especially when she explains to Edward why she really wants to become a vampire. I think the wolves look as real as you can get, and I am a big sci-fi fan, too. From what I have read so far the haters of this movie don't know the deeper story line as they have not read the books. I was really happy how the tent scene and the scene in which Edward buys a bed for Bella's sake both turned out - pretty much as I pictured them. The army of vampires plot and the Volturi visit were a bit skimped on, but this cannot be a 4 hour movie. I went with three younger women and they all loved the movie, too. If you are into the books, you won't be disappointed.",8,12,27,30 June 2010
