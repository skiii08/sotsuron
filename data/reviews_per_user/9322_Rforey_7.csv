The Blair Witch Project," What a very original, very boring film.
","I fail to see how anyone can like this movie, let alone be scared by it.The plot is uninteresting, the suspense is non-existent, the acting is neither good-nor-bad - in fact to me it was inconsequential.  I simply couldn't have cared less about the characters.I had hoped all the way through that something interesting would happen...it didn't.  People say that while the film wasn't great, the last 5-minutes of the film were scary...they weren't.  I am told that it was an original idea for a film...what good is an 'original' film that bores you to tears?My advice would be this: If you like suspense movies, don't see this film. If you like thrillers, don't see this film.  If you like horror flicks, don't see this film.  If you like films about a bunch of kids running around in the woods trying to be scared, throwing their maps away for no reason and making you wish they would just hurry up and die...don't see this film.",Null,2,4,19 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Great acting, great film, greatness!
","I want to start by saying that this film definitely had the best lighting/visual image of 1999.  I in fact have never been so impressed by a films 'look.'  This is one of the reasons that it is very high ranking on my best-ever-movies list.  My compliments to the special effects & art departments.I hadn't noticed until recently how good an actress Christina Ricci was. After watching her performances in 'The Opposite of Sex', 'The Ice Storm' and 'ahem 'Little Red Riding Hood'; it spurred me on to want to see her in 'Sleepy Hollow.'  And for those of you who haven't seen it yet, she doesn't disappoint.  The same can be said of Johnny Depp (who I'm actually not a great fan of - but after this movie, I may have to become one!) and the rest of the cast.The story is very good as well.  Not the most intellectual film ever, but then not every movie has to be.  This film may not be Oscar material, but it excels in its field of capturing, holding and entertaining the viewer.  It's like a book you'll read again and again and won't want to put down.  I have been waiting anxiously for 4-5 months for it to come out on DVD, and I never say that about a film!Put simply, this film is great.  Great acting, great story, great look.  Go see it now!",Null,0,0,19 May 2000
The Beach," Just awful!
","It had no plot to speak of, a relatively uninteresting storyline and only fairly good acting.It was OK until around half way through where the main character had a breakdown and the whole film took on a very 'Thin Red Line' slant, i.e. pretentious and utterly boring.It was unstructured and unentertaining; good only for it's scenery and occasional attempts at humour.",2,2,3,14 February 2000
Alien," Analysis of Alien
","The worst part of ALIEN has got to be the appallingly pretentious Freudian psychoanalytical interpretation of the film put forth by Barbara Creed in The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis (London, 1993).  The assumption that the fear produced by ALIEN is based upon the fear of the castrating archaic mother is so general it fails to carry any weight.  While instances of maternal separation are seen (the Alien bursts through Kane's body) and the notion of individuality being achieved by these means is an interesting one, the attribution of Freudian philosophy to this film as a whole is a stretch to say the least.  How can one argue against such a sweeping analysis when all other arguments are countered with subconscious motivation?!  The unconscious argument assumes that society as a whole maintains the same subconscious interpretation, a fact I find very hard to believe.  It would also imply some sort of unlevelled genius in the film making process who could transcend consciousness and develop a conscious idea into a subconscious response - again, doubtful on such a scale. Creed's approach also fails to take into account filmic industrial history and the audience's interpretation of the movie.My interpretation of the fear induced by ALIEN holds with the idea of primordial instinct.  The natural fight-or-flight instinct found in animals when confronted with a predator is masterfully used to create a feeling of fear due to the setting in which ALIEN takes place.  Trapped in a spacecraft, there is no place to hide from the super-predator.  The setting acts as a prison rather than a womb as asserted by Creed.  The appearance of the Alien in such abject terms serves not to equate it with 'monstrous femininity', but simply to disturb through the abject itself.  While not as repulsive as many other scenes (the eye-cutting scene in Bunuel and Dali's UN CHIEN ANDALOU being the most disturbing filmic scene in my opinion), the image of the Alien is nonetheless unattractive to human emotion in all its puss-filled, slimy glory.Creed goes on to say that the film deals with the mother's rejection and deception of her children - we find that 'Mother' had been following the robotic science officer's commands all along and had thought of the humans as 'expendable'.  I would add to this argument the role that the company (who the crew are working for) play in deceiving humanity.  It was, after all, the company who sent the crew to their ultimate deaths.  Whether this fact should be interpreted as a commentary on unseen evils or on the soulless and inhumane nature of the corporation, I leave open to debate. However, I would argue that this aspect of the film should be examined further in order to assess the claims of Ridley Scott as auteur.Personally I did not like the film and am not a great fan of the sci-fi/horror genre.  However, if you are interested in film analysis (and not just necessarily psychoanalysis-as is commonly held with this particular film) then I would urge you to see this film if for no other reason than as a subject of debate.  After that, rent THE SHINING and enjoy the best horror movie ever made.",3,7,31,3 December 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Violence for violence's sake...a pointless movie
","I'm a big fan of Tarantino's movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were masterpieces and Jackie Brown to a lesser extent was still an enjoyable flick.  So it was with great disappointment that I was presented with his latest offering in the form of Kill Bill.  After all the hype it was always going to be difficult for this movie to live up to expectations, but in the end, it didn't come close.The single, most accurate word to describe Kill Bill would be 'pointless'. Whereas Pulp Fiction was interesting on more than just a visual and stylistic level, Kill Bill does not venture past being a violent movie for violence's sake.  It is style above substance, and violence without a point to it.  The characters are drastically underdeveloped (don't take this to mean that the acting is bad, as it is not) and the audience is not really led to identify with the characters in any way.The movie, whilst being visually splendid, relies far too heavily on the fact that it is a 'Tarantino Film' to gain the critics applause, rather than concentrating on developing an interesting and compelling story (as was best achieved in Pulp Fiction.) Of course you will not find a 'critic' who will stand up and expose the film for what it really is - a senseless portrayal of violence - for fear of not understanding Tarantino's 'underlying message' or what have you.  On that front all I have to say is that after several years of studying film, the only point of relevance Kill Bill makes is in exposing the level to which society has become accustomed to violence. The audience in the cinema laughed out loud at the sight of people getting their limbs severed and screaming in agony...yes, hilarious.Another point I would make is that the inclusion of a tacky Pokemon-esque sequence does not make Tarantino an artistic genius.  It is pure self-indulgent pretentiousness that tries to further the myth that if you 'don't get it' you're somehow not intelligent enough to enjoy Tarantino's genius. Pure rubbish. It is quite simply a gimmick employed by someone who obviously considers himself to be an 'artiste'.Of course having read this (and if you've got this far, I thank you!) it may be argued that I simply don't 'get' this type of film.  To that I would say that violence in context is one thing and I can accept that as valid, but violence as an entire movie is quite another.  This is where Kill Bill and the rest of Tarantino's films differ.Let me clarify - there is nothing wrong with this film.  It will be enjoyed by those who want to see mindless violence, and that's fair enough. But it is not a masterpiece by any means, and the Tarantino label cannot change that.  4/10, purely for its visual aspects (which it rips off from Crouching Tiger) and some inventive cinematography.",3,4,7,10 October 2003
Final Destination," Predictable, predictable, predictable.
","Ever since I've seen this movie, I've been comparing myself to the main character...See, he predicted an air-crash, and I predicted this whole movie from start to finish.  I have never been so right in all my life.It works like this: You go to the cinema, you watch the film, you can tell what will happen at least a minute before it does.  It is so predictable it is untrue.  Maybe it's because I've seen too many horror/teen flicks, or maybe it's because this movie is just so uninventive; whatever, it is very annoying.Aside from this, the acting is awful (especially from Ali Larter & the female teacher [I forget her name - what an impact she must have made!]), the script is useless and the movie is terribly made.  Take a look at the first interrogation scene and laugh in the knowledge that anyone could have shot it better.On the upside, the sound is good and it will make you jump a few times.  If you like being frightened, watch the movie just for these moments.  If you like watching good movies, save your money.",Null,0,0,27 May 2000
The Thin Red Line," The worst movie ever made.
","There is no other way to describe this film than the worst movie that has ever been made.  It simply bored me to tears.I won't attempt to explain why it was so bad, because every single bit of it was awful.  I can't point out a single flaw, I can't point out many flaws; the film was just complete nonsense.If ever I have wasted 3 hours of my life, it has been watching this film.For those thinking of watching it: The entire cinema emptied within seconds of it ending, to chants of 'God, that was rubbish' and 'What the hell was that?!'I cannot possibly begin to venture reasons for those reviewers who have said they liked it, liking it.  The only one I can come up with is the usual reason that they want to make others feel that they don't understand it, when there really wasn't anything to understand.I implore anyone contemplating seeing this movie; please, please go and watch a movie that won't make you loose faith in films for good.  It is worse than I can ever describe.",Null,0,1,19 May 2000
