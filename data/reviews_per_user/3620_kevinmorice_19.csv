The King's Speech," Good story, fantastically told
","Another movie-stealing performance from Geoffrey Rush. And normally that is where I would stop in a review of this film but it deserves more.The very idea of a period piece about a stammering King finding his voice should bore me to tears. However, the story is told in a sympathetic manner with humour and pathos blended smoothly throughout; the relationships between the major characters feel genuine; and the performances of the three major cast members overshadow any of my doubts about the format.I am not a fan of Firth or Bonham-Carter but they both fill out their roles in such a strong manner that very early in the movie I had forgotten my general dislike of them and accepted them as the characters rather than the actors.There are some strange shot choices from Hooper trying to capture stylish shots of the period architecture and decor but they fit well with the tone of the film.There are some little niggles throughout the movie that distract from the strength of the performances. Guy Pearce is wasted. Michael Gambon's portrayal of a supposedly dying King has far too much strength and life in it. Timothy Spall is no Winston Churchill to the point that it is necessary to shoe-horn in a blatant introduction to the audience rather than trust them to recognise his impression with a more subtle introduction.But these are all little niggles, enough to keep me from giving it a higher score but not enough to spoil it.",8,3,6,19 January 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Modern teen classic
","I have ticked the contains spoilers button but I don't have any specific spoilers in here, just a risk that if you read this review you might be watching for the 'wrong' things as I point them out. rather than focusing on some fantastic underlying work.The story and the direction is great and the characterisation is excellent. Logan Lerman is perfect in the lead role. I struggled a bit with the older women all being attracted to the lead but can't argue with it too much.The rest of it really suffers from some overly powerful casting though, especially in the first half as you have to try and get over the history of the players.Emma Watson is always going to be too hot, and too cool, to be a misfit and as great as she is in this she readily outshines her character. But this is nothing compared to Ezra Miller's presence, I just couldn't help waiting for the bow and arrow to come out and for him to slaughter all of his class mates.For my money this should have been on the Oscar list and in a decade, once Miller and Watson are less associated with their own past I think it will really have a place amongst the hearts of fans of the Breakfast Club / Cant Buy Me Love / Ferris Bueller....",8,0,1,11 January 2013
Lone Survivor," Bravo Two Zero - Big budget US remake
","It is very big, and full of pretty American movie stars with bad beards, but it is just a remake of Bravo Two Zero. Right down to them getting spotted by a goatherd and arguing about their options, and then still not coming up with the more obvious ones.Try:Option 4. Cuff them together before you let them go. Still safe for them but means they take much longer to get help.Option 5. Take them with you for an hour before you let them go. That means you are 3 hours further away by the time they raise the alarm. From there it all gets a bit Hollywood. I can ignore the seemingly infinite ammunition, because at least you see them changing magazines, it just seems they are carrying about 20 magazines each. Every time a taliban gets shot by an American, it is instantly fatal. Every time an American gets shot, or blown up, or hit by shrapnel or falls down a 50 foot cliff into a tree/rock, he just gets up and carries on as if nothing happened. One of them even gets shot in the head and carries on! This gets even more ridiculous near the end when this skill becomes transferable to the helpful Afghani, who is able to win a fist fight with the taliban leader despite being shot in the arm.",6,17,32,8 February 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's new low
","OK, first up I have two admissions to make. Firstly, my ridiculously low vote is NOT an attempt to balance out the high marks that the Tarantinophiles have given this film and secondly that I am reviewing based only on the first half of the movie because it was so dire I gave up.{Spoliers from here}Quentin, a film is not a book, we do not need to be told where the chapters are. Nor do we need subtitles in the same language as the spoken words.Here are a few more subtle tips for you: Good actors can multi-task.Even if you must have them read your horribly over-complex dialogue they should be able to cope with actions at the same time and don't need to always sit at a table and talk at each other. If you are going to use multiple languages as a plot device so that the people hiding under the floorboards don't understand then don't use words that have been adopted across both languages (e.g. masquerade).There are alternatives to extreme violence and verbose story-telling, but if these are the only tools in your ridiculously limited arsenal then feel free to blend them rather than just one, then the other, then back to the first one.If you are so insecure that you need to leave messages to yourself in the movie then try to be a bit smoother than 'French people are great because they love directors'.If you just do a half-baked job of stealing from and copy-catting icons who did a much better job of something in the first place, it is not an homage, it's an insult.",1,10,18,28 March 2010
The Hunger Games," It doesn't make sense
","I haven't read the book. Therefore some of the following is assumption on my part.For example I have to assume that the book makes sense and that trying to squeeze it onto celluloid meant cutting some of the less important story points. Unfortunately whoever did the cutting seems to have gotten a little happy with the scissors. The basic idea of cutting up revolutionary areas into districts and oppressing them by a lottery that kills off their children, I can see the point of this enough that I will take it as a fundamental plot point that I am not meant to question. I accepted the similar premise for the Running Man so I can't really argue with it here. But they keep on with inconsistencies that just start to grate. <ul><li>If only one kid can live why would you form a team? At some point you have to kill your team-mates, and they have to kill you! - Why do District 11 riot when Rue is killed, their girl (the ginger one that accidentally poisons herself with the berries) is still alive at that point. - Why do all the people that can't get food even care about watching the TV? And why do they all have TV's in their shanty-town shacks? And why do they seem so keen on watching their children kill each other? - In a society with the technology to create touchable 3D holographic projections why would anyone believe it was real? And indeed, if you have that technology, why make it real?</li></ul>All of these little niggles just picked away at me during the movie. But the reason they niggled and annoyed me was because the film didn't flow properly. It kept drifting off into these scenic bits with soft music that didn't make any sense and it kept reminding you that you were watching a movie so you aren't held in and your brain starts picking at those threads.it isn't terrible. It just doesn't really work.",5,7,15,23 March 2012
The Hateful Eight," Utter garbage
","Utter garbage and anyone who says otherwise is blinded by the big names, the hyper-violence, abusive swearing and the misguided idea that Tarantino is good director. He gives a great interview, talks a fantastic story and is hugely knowledgable about film, but he cannot direct and he certainly cannot write. He is an absolute one-trick pony with his fractured story-telling technique, and his attempts at homage are just cheap copies of considerably better works.",2,2,7,9 February 2018
The Revenant," Very pretty, but not very good
","Inarritu has spent a lots of time polishing this turd. Some of the artistic shots are absolutely fabulous. They have obviously had the second unit out in the snow for a great long time shooting scenic trees and snow. The rest is a half-written 30 minute script, packed out with some nice scenery and some hyper-violent scenes to make sure you don't fall asleep. There is no need for a lot of the extremity of the violence. Human vs Human, Animal vs Human, Human vs Animal, all ridiculously bloody and disgusting for no real reason.If Leo does finally get an Oscar for this he should hand it straight back because it will have been based purely on pity rather than on the actual performance involved in this film.",6,1,2,30 January 2016
Divergent," More holes than a colander
","Much like similar teen girl action movie series this one kills itself early on by introducing so many holes that the house of cards that they then try to build has no foundation. Before the credits are even over the story makes less than no sense. Having destroyed civilisation in a world war (ok) Chicago survives. The survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city, 300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5 factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace. So none of that makes sense, and much like Hunger Games, having built a nonsensical premise we now follow a teenage girl as she turns into a super-soldier capable of jumping of buildings fighting off trained armies single-handed (using a cheap looking paint-ball gun). All the while with her buff and perfectly capable new boyfriend doing as little as possible to help her. Oh and I forgot a quick detour while we ride a pointless zip wire through some buildings for absolutely no reason than to try and spend some of the left over special effects budget.And occasionally Kate Winslet pops up, but is shot from funny angles all the time while they try to make her baby look less visible. Not that they need to as her bad blonde hair is distracting enough.All in a total waste of 2 hours. Just go and watch Twilight or Hunger Games for the same movie done slightly (but not a lot) better.",4,377,588,11 April 2014
No Country for Old Men," It's The Emperor's New Clothes Movie Version
","I don't know what film that all the high scoring reviewers (and it seems the academy voters) watched but it certainly wasn't the one I have seen, twice.Why did I go twice to a film I have rated so low? I had to go a second time because I thought I must have missed some basic bit of explanation the first time round. Turns out I didn't.This film probably warrants a score of about 6 due to some high strong performances and the general quality of film-making, but these are wasted as the story has huge holes and the ending is just nonsense.Those people clogging up the bulletin boards trying to explain how there is some deeper meaning are running themselves in circles creating whole chunks of backstory and assumptions that just aren't provided in the movie.It is the emperors new clothes in a movie, if you claim to see the invisible overcoat that just isn't there then maybe you need to look again.",2,30,62,25 February 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Where to start?
","Where to start with this?Well I am going to start half an hour after the film, with the seasick feeling and the headache I had for the rest of the night. If 48fps is the future of cinema then cinema is finished. It did make the images and motion slightly clearer, but all that did was make it harder to get drawn into the film and afterwards it left me seasick.Now to the film itself. There is the obvious problem that everyone was already aware of that such a small book doesn't warrant being stretched into such a long film, never mind three films. But the money men at the film companies obviously knew better so irrelevant distractions are shoe-horned in, long tracking shots are stretched to 5 times the length they need to be, the songs are stretched out .... And yet somehow the important sections which are genuine to the book (the trolls and the riddle game) still feel rushed through.Some of the other quirks that annoyed me to varying degrees: <ul><li>Orcs out in daylight 60 years before the Uruk-hai. </li></ul><ul><li>Dwarfs playing hackey-sack with the good china. </li></ul><ul><li>James Nesbit just being James Nesbit. </li></ul><ul><li>Most of the dwarfs being incidental despite the extra running time. </li></ul><ul><li>Gandalf's height going up and down compared to the other characters, even within scenes. </li></ul><ul><li>Saruman being so openly evil already, so much so that Galadriel and Gandalf sneak around behind his back. </li></ul><ul><li>The CGI being much too obvious. (The increased frames just made that look more obvious). </li></ul><ul><li>The storm giants were totally wasted. </li></ul><ul><li>Bilbo is meant to distract the trolls all night but he lasts about 20 seconds! </li></ul><ul><li>And how many of the shots were just stolen straight from LOTR. (All the tracking shots, the chase scene, all the Gollum close-ups. A decent editor and dubbing team could have built 80% of the movie from LOTR footage.)</li></ul>I wanted to love this film but I have never been so disappointed. I have seen worse films (plenty of them) but I expected them to be worse. I have seen great directors try to be too clever on the back of their reputation and fail miserably (Avatar). I have seen books ruined by trying to squeeze them onto celluloid (Paycheck, Hunger Games). But never have I seen such awesome base material and a great director, and a great producer, turn out such rubbish.",5,8,23,15 December 2012
Django Unchained," Inglorious Basterds - Cowboy style
","Truly typical Tarantino effort.Violence for the sake of it, interspersed with long-winded speeches, and then more ridiculous violence, and as many offensive swear words as he thinks he can squeeze in. Tarantino sticks to his usual style of stealing tricks from better directors, and then not executing them properly. He continues to cast some of the biggest heavyweight actors on the planet, and then not trust them to both speak and move at the same time. Much like Inglorious he just cuts back and forward between pointless violent action scenes, and then people sitting or standing still while he has one of them ramble along with some story filler (very little of which makes any sense) and then back to another scene of ridiculously over the top violence.",3,10,15,26 December 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," One more off the Tarantino production line
","Tarantino uses every tool in his (and everyone else's') bag, from the fractured story-telling and excessive violence that have become his trademarks through cuts of anime and a morricone-esque soundtrack to a succession of extreme close-ups and gore-filled internal anatomy shots which are lifted straight from the CSI production manual.Unfortunately, for all the skill in reproducing the tricks he fails to conjure anything resembling a worthwhile storyline and despite the numerous star turns is unable to conjure a meaningful film.Great if you want to sit and watch an almost documentary homage to the myriad tricks from past masters all being crammed into 100mins, but as a movie-experience, leave well alone.",4,7,11,7 January 2007
Avatar," Don't believe the hype
","OK, so this film is probably worth 5 or 6 *'s purely on the visuals but I had to give it a 1 to try and make up for all the people who seem to have watched it with their brain switched into neutral and given it 10's.It isn't the revolution in cinema, and it doesn't make 3-D worthwhile. It already looks dated compared to the likes of District 9 which came out 6 months before it. It looks suspiciously like someone showed Cameron a raft of Anime and computer games and he thought he could do something better but without taking any notice of the inherent depth. Cameron has been a fantastic film-maker but he has been on the slide and this effort is just visuals for the sake of it with not a single ounce of story to back it up. Truly the low-point in Cameron's career.",1,10,30,2 January 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," Overthought and under-executed
","Jessica Chastain is brilliant in this movie. Unfortunately nothing else really keeps up with her.Jason Clarke doesn't do anything to help. And is too much like Jason Clarke, rather than a PhD CIA interrogator. Similarly Kyle Chandler doesn't give the impression of a CIA heavy-hitter and few of the others are given any chance to make an impression. Some of the choppy camera work is obviously included to try and make you feel more a part of the action, it just pushes you out by making you feel a bit off balance and aware of that you are watching a movie.It wants to be a documentary but it doesn't tell anything new, and in some situations it actually conflicts with accepted public information.The script is bland. The first hour assumes a level of knowledge that a lot of the audience simply won't have. Then there are scenes to build the tension, where it is obvious that big tag lines are dying to be in there, but they just don't come. Even the action scene is done at virtually walking pace. This may be more realistic, it may be what really happened. But it isn't cinema friendly.All in all, disappointing.",5,9,18,3 February 2013
Black Panther," So much average
","This film is not helped by the impending Avengers: Infinity War. It is certainly not helped by running that trailer before the film and instantly removing any jeopardy by showing us which major characters live to appear again in the future movie!More importantly though, how do Michael Bay style fight scenes still exist in a world where John Wick choreography is available and Marvel money is on the table? Honestly, I hated the last 20 minutes so much I felt like I was watching a Transformers spin-off. Not just the war-rhinos, which were utterly, shockingly bad, but the entirety of all three of the final sequences were poor CGI, poorly shot, poorly choreographed and added absolutely nothing. Also this is the first Marvel movie where I simply didn't care about any of the characters. No-one was relatable. The closest I could get was to Killmonger, who at least had reasons for his overall behaviour and a character arc that goes somewhere. But if I have to associate with a murderous villain who kills his own friends for no reason that isn't endearing me to the film.",6,47,104,14 February 2018
Pitch Perfect," Acamazing!!
","I wasn't quite dragged to this but nor was I rushing to sit in a cinema full of 500 teenage girls to watch a Glee rip-off. It didn't take any dragging to get me back in the second time. This movie is being so undersold. It should be bigger than the Hangover.This is what Glee should have been. The music is awesome. The dancing is awesome. The script is awesome. The performances are awesome. Some of the set piece performance scenes had people in the audiences spontaneously clapping. Anna Kendrick is amazing!! She is angsty and grumpy when she needs to be without ever losing out on being sexy and alluring and smart.Rebel Wilson is hilarious! She takes set-up gags and lines that deserve a snort of derision and makes you fall off your seat with her delivery.Elizabeth Banks (with more than a little help from John Michael Higgins) almost steals her own movie out from underneath them all despite having less lines than Arnie in the Terminator.And the supporting cast are fantastic. Even where they are trying to play stereotypes they take enough of the edge off them to make them lovable in their own right. The musical director and the script writers for this absolute gem deserve to be picking up armloads of awards. The script synopsis is basic, nothing clever at all, you know the ending from the start. But that doesn't matter, the journey to that ending is simply fantastic.And it is worth going twice. Some of the jokes are well hidden. Tucked in behind others so you are still laughing at the first and you miss the follow-up. Some are even hidden in plain sight but you are too busy watching something more obvious. The rape whistle gag (in the trailer so not a spoiler, sneaks back in near the end but in such a hectic scene you can easily miss it).",9,12,20,23 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The most complete movie ever??
","So, you set out to write a story to make into a movie. How do you decide whether to write a Pirate romp, a Sci-Fi story, a Magical Fantasy with Wizards and Giants, a Heroic adventure, a War epic, a Love tale with a Princess, or even 'just' an Action movie? If you are George Lucas, you don't. You put them all into one.You start with a couple of robots and tell the whole story from the perspective of a couple of lost servants towed along through the maelstrom that follows. You throw in a beautiful Princess in a flowing white gown, then contrast her with probably the greatest evil entrance in film history, a 7foot terror dressed all in black and hidden by a mask.You twist off to start the Heroic arc of the teenager taking orders from his over-protective step-parents. He recruits a Wizard, replete with Shakespearean gravitas and a cloak to match, to guide his endeavours. They then head off in search of a pirate with a laser gun and an 8foot teddy-bear sidekick, to help rescue the Princess.An enemy ship so enormous they mistake it for a planet, disguising themselves as enemy soldiers, escaping from a closing garbage compressor (and it's monocular octopus), sword fighting with glowing blades against the mystical giant, swinging across open chasms with the princess, an aerial battle over the enemy ship and even a ghostly return of the wizard.What more could you cram into two hours of the greatest escapism ever captured on film? (Well, maybe a Jim Henson midget green alien with even more mystical powers and some funny grammar, but for that you only have to watch the next episode).",10,0,1,20 January 2007
Hacksaw Ridge," Saving Private Ryan plus Full Metal Jacket = Hacksaw Ridge
","Seen Full Metal Jacket? Then you have seen the first half hour of this movie, just imagine Vince Vaughn doing a bad impression of the drill sergeant and you are there already. Seen the trailer? Then you have seen all the story bits of this movie. They aren't particularly deep or clever and while they provide a narrative for the story, you have seen it all in the trailer!Seen the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan? Then you have seen the rest of this movie. Lots of gory violence, fire stunts, bits of people being blown apart, and general graphic carnage.For all that Andrew Garfield is very good. The mass of Australian actors that make up the rest of the cast generally mask their accents well enough. The racist portrayal of the Japanese is almost forgivable given the context of the film. Shouldn't be on the Oscar shortlist, but no surprise that a bit of Americanised propaganda got so many votes in the current climate of world politics.",6,6,15,27 January 2017
The Pursuit of Happyness," It's pointless!!!
","It's quite simple. This movie has no point.You know the ending before you are 10 minutes in. In fact, you could have written the entire script on the back of a napkin during your lunch break. Only you would have been hard pressed to come up with a story quite so bland and unimaginative.What is worse is that this is a film that effectively praises the central character for dragging his child onto the street to satisfy his own pursuit, not of 'happyness', but of money in his pure greed to get a job with a big money finance company.Will Smith simply plays himself, to the point of falling back on his Prince of Bel Air vocabulary on more than one occasion and Thandie Newton does her best to portray a character with no depth.The occasional 80's reference scores nostalgia points and Jaden Smith delivers what little is asked of him but overall this is 145 mins of my life that would have been better spent doing the ironing, and probably more enjoyably spent at that.",3,17,29,20 January 2007
