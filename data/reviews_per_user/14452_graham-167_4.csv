The Young Victoria," Better than I expected
","I went into this expecting not to like it; I figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest, and rather plodding and dull.It's actually far better than that, and I found myself really enjoying it. I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert, who died young, and she mourned him ever after. Seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating; in fact I found myself wishing I'd seen more of the story, and I imagine we may see a sequel at some point.Visually the film is stunning. The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top. The acting is top notch from everybody involved.In a word, it was great!",Null,116,141,10 March 2009
Batman Begins," My my, they actually pulled it off!
","I really enjoyed this one. Although I loved Tim Burton's movie, it always felt a little overdone; Gotham didn't feel like a real city, not a place you could imagine people living, and the characters felt a bit too overwrought to be real people.This movie feels much more grounded and realistic. Gotham feels like a real city - let's be honest, it feels like New York. And the characters both good and bad feel like real people.I liked Bruce's development. We never really got an origin story for Batman before in the movies - we knew what happened to make him Batman, but mostly they told us about it and showed flashbacks, we never saw it in any real detail like we do here. Seeing the lasting impact of his parent's death gave you more connection with Bruce, and seeing him develop the Batman concept as a carefully calculated ploy designed to achieve a specific effect made it much more believable than the 'I'm depressed, I saw a bat - hey, I'll dress as a bat and fight crime!' of previous movies.More kudos for the development of the toys. Introducing them as prototype weapons which Bruce appropriated was an inspired touch, and showing him actually developing his gear over his first few times out was another touch that made it more grounded and believable. These scenes also introduced some much needed and well played humour from Morgan Freeman (and Michael Caine is also excellent in this regard.) Things started to go a bit over the top with the grand evil scheme to destroy Gotham. The whole plot to spread fear gas around made no sense whatsoever and is riddled with scientific nonsense : why pour the stuff into the water supply for weeks before? Water doesn't sit in pipes in a city for weeks on end, it gets constantly flushed through - most of their chemical would be flushed away! Indeed, since the poisoning of the water stopped a good day or two before the final stage than little if any of it would be left in the pipes at all. Additionally, the microwave 'vapourise all the water' weapon made no sense - it boils all the water in the pipes over hundreds if not thousands of yards, but has no effect on people and machinery standing right next to it! I'd rather they had just focused on having Batman fighting a conventional crime boss, as this would have continued the whole 'keeping it real' thing.But while annoying, it doesn't come close to wrecking the movie. Batman Begins is by far the best of the Batman movies, and one of the better superhero movies ever made.",Null,4,5,10 August 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Pretty good
","Okay, so the plot is paper thin - there is virtually nothing in this movie that isn't covered by the basic 'married couple who both find that the other is a hit man/woman' one line summary. Certainly if you watch the trailer, you will know pretty much the entire plot.For a comedy, it's not all that funny. So much time is given over to action scenes that there isn't all that much time for jokes. But what comedy there is works well. Brad Pitt especially shows himself as a good comic actor, and Angelina is no slouch either.There's bags and bags of people and things getting shot and blowing up, which is entertaining enough in an over the top kind of way.What puts it over the top from just another comedy/action movie to a pretty good comedy/action movie is the presence of Angelina Jolie, who is absolutely the most beautiful woman alive.",Null,0,2,10 August 2005
Sin City," Outstanding
","I initially didn't think I was going to like this. I knew it was a series of fairly unconnected stories, and the first two seemed to occupy about five minutes each. I thought the whole movie would carry on that way, and if so it would have been a disjointed mess. Fortunately it settles down quickly - and later on it returns to the little bits and develops them fully to boot.Overall, I loved it. It's got a very weird visual style, over the top characters, gritty as all hell plots. Don't look for heroes in this movie - there are none. Sin City is a place where everybody gouges everybody else every chance they get, because it's the only way you get even a slim chance to stay alive. If there was a real city like this, no sane person would go within a hundred miles of it - but it's the kind of place that sucks people in and traps them there even as it breaks them down.It all falls apart if you stop to think about it, but you don't stop to think about it so that's not a problem. Best film I've seen in ages.",Null,0,1,10 August 2005
