Angels & Demons," Everything fits terrible together!
","Langdon is back, this time he is brought in by the Vatican who need his help to decipher a message designed by the mysterious Illuminati. Okay, first of all any story with the Illuminati should be a good one, in my opinion, as its about a group of people bound by secrets.I understand it is supposed to be a thriller and a 'puzzle' if you will, but honestly the statues pointing...That's when I started to laugh, the whole film is overblown, the ending with Mcgregor was very heroic and ridiculous when he survives the initial explosion.Tom Hanks is one actor that I can always watch, because he is a master of his craft, but he seems to fall short, and there's one reason the script and plot is not very good.",2,1,1,14 March 2011
Scarface," I'm Tony Montana!!!!!
","Scarface is in my eyes the greatest gangster movie, today.It revolves around a Cuban immigrant named Tony Montana who comes from Cuba and begins life in the states; Miami.Tony who has a 'get rich quick' attitude looks for any means to become wealthy and begins work for Frank Lopez, here he begins to rise through the ranks and slowly creates tension with the boss.Soon an attempt is made on Tony's life, however Tony survives and retaliates by killing his boss. Now he is in control.But with control and power, comes paranoia and soon the drug lord must try to hold his position at the top, which ends in a spectacular shootout in his precious and lavish home.Scarface is a epic that shows the rise of someone with nothing and how anything is possible the end scenes is explosive and is worth every minute; the film portrays the lifestyle, one would like to lead in the world of gangsters and drugs, it is fast, sexy and brutal.The film has great sets and some of the most famous line-liners. The character Tony Montana is instantly seen as a role-model to many young people today. Al Pacino will always be remembered as Tony Montana.",10,0,1,9 July 2007
Walk the Line," A fine performance by Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon
","Walk the Line tells the tale of real life singer Johnny Cash and his journey, the hardships he faced and his inner demons. The film is only helped to greater depths by the lead actors Joaquin Pheonix is great in the role and carries to the audience with him, making you understand the singers world, what he faces everyday and the temptations that come with fame.Reese Witherspoon adds the touch of sweetness to the grim and dark film, she plays the woman Cash loves with all his heart yet she cannot give in to her heart due to the moral values that hold America, the best scene in the film is when Cash goes to a record producer and sings a 'Choir song' and then the producer asks him to sing about whats in his heart and Cash sings 'Folsom Prison'...A brilliant moment.Cocaine Blues is also a bonus and Joaquin Pheonix's voice only adds to the dark matters of each Johnny Cash song.",9,0,0,2 November 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Second greatest comic book movie ever made.
","I'm a comic-book nerd...(Just in case you wanna label me).And this is probably the second greatest Comic book movie ever made; first being 'Batman Begins'. And the third if your wondering is Iron-Man. The reason why this movie is so high up on my list, is because it concentrates on the origin story but at the same time keeps going....(If you understand what I'm babbling on about).The story is simple. Bruce Banner is a scientist, whom when angered turns into the 'Incredible Hulk'; a creature of pure rage, and so the American Government look to harness this creature for their own benefit. Banner realising the sheer magnitude of this situation, goes on the run.Ang Lee's version was disappointing with the 'Steroid-like-induced dogs'...But it wasn't that bad...(But it was bad).This movie has a almost spine-tingling music that runs through it, from the television series. With 'real' actors, not models who look like comic book characters...I have new found respect for Edward Norton. He just fits the role of Banner brilliantly, Liv Tyler is sweet as Betty; while Tim Roth and William Hurt are great villains.But the greatest asset of this comic book movie is the Hulk. He is visually stunning and much more menacing than Lee's attempt. The build up to Banner's change is handled magnificently as we, the audience feel Banners anger and rage as they 'beat him up', 'hurt his lover'...And then Hulk arrives....And the build up to the arrival of Abomination is beautifully executed, its definitely well-worth the wait...Bringing two of Marvel's most monstrous creations to duel it out...His look is also terrifying to say the least when you catch the first glimpse of him on the big screen...But the greatest aspect of this Comic Book Movie is the end fight...The greatest comic book fight, also considering that its all CGI...I love how Hulk break out of the ground and gets ready breaking a cop car and creating 'Boxing gloves', LOL.... And he say's the line that we've been waiting for 'HULK SMASH!!'. Simply one word to describe this monster of a movie...Incredible.",10,2,3,16 July 2009
Mission: Impossible III," 'Excute'
","Ethan Hunt must return to the field to bring down a notorious arms dealer, but it seems there is a mole in Ethan's team and now he must rescue his wife from the bad guys.This film is pure substance, great scenery and great action sequences.The clothes and weapons scream sexy.Tom Cruise is fantastic as Ethan the spy who knows no danger.The stunts are breathtaking and the new cast members play a roles that are needed and hopefully will expand in future franchises.The music score is perfect once again and keeps the audience guessing, the action scenes are perfectly placed in the order that they come in.Good solid action film that does not disappoint.",8,3,4,6 March 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," The Kansas City Shuffle.
","I admit I was turned away from this film simply because it didn't look that interesting with the trailers, and seeing Bruce Willis play yet another Hit-man.But finally I decided to watch this simply because Josh Hartnett was in it and Lucy Liu.I expected a comedy.The opening story about the 'The Kansas Shuffle' was an eye-opener. It tells the tale of a man who makes a bet which he cannot pay off, if he was to lose. In return the gangsters he owes money to, kill his whole family.Josh Hartnett seemingly plays the friend of 'Nick' and finds himself in a case of mistaken identity where Nick owes money to, two very dangerous criminals. The Boss and the Rabbi.Josh's character Slevin begins to fall for Nick's neighbour Lindsey (Lucy Liu) and so he must find a way to play the two gangsters and a mysterious hit-man known only as the 'GoodKat'.The film has some great lines and plays on words perfectly. Josh Hartnett plays his part well. While Bruce Willis plays the silent hit-man. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley shine more then ever while Lucy Liu plays an adorable and bubbly character who sizzles sexy in every scene.The films is full of comedy yet it has a surprising element of action and keeps audience members on the edge of their seat. Bits are complicated but the characters take their time to explain what is going on.The best scene in my opinion was the bed scene were Lindey and Slevin talk about Bond. Just a great moment were nothing else matters, no gangsters no debts or deaths.A great movie.",10,12,19,13 May 2008
Sucker Punch," Seriously? You're going to call this film epic?
","Babydoll ends up in a mental institution, which magically transforms into a dance club were she uses her imagination to keep her busy as she and her friends go after objects to escape...In her imagination she fights demonic Samurai, Dragons, Robots and Nazi Zombies (Remind you of a certain 'Call of Duty' game?)Simply put, this film is a mess. The storyline tries to be clever as it weaves in and out of fantasy and reality yet falls flat on its face at the first hurdle, when we realise its a fantasy within a fantasy....(Not the cleverest concept or cleverly executed)...Then you've got the actresses, beautiful to look at, but they lack the acting skills to pull off such a feat...And finally, the visuals...Amazing...But thats about it..300 was visually stunning and it had the actors to give a strong as well as believable performance. Watchmen was bearable as I understood that he wished to show a darker side of the superhero figure...But Suckerpunch is just pure rubbish..the only scene I liked was the fight against the Samurai demons, the rest was a waste of time.",1,4,11,2 July 2011
3:10 to Yuma," 'They're gonna hang me in the morning, A'fore this night is done. They're gonna hang me in the morning, and I'll never see the sun.'
","Daniel Evans needs money to save his farm and his family from going hungry and so when Outlaw Ben Wade is captured Dan agrees to escort the villain onto the 3:10 to Yuma. But Wade's gang of bandits aren't going to let their boss go down and so, Daniel Evans must not only watch out for Wades men, but Wade himself as they cross country to the train station.The acting is genuinely brilliant, all solid performances delivered by everyone, Christian Bale shines here, but again he is outshone by Russel Crowe, one I don't necessarily watch often...But he genuinely is quite charming in the role of an outlaw.The action is satisfactory, I would have liked to see and punch up between Daniel Evans and Ben Wade, and the other thing that was spectacular, was the great shots of the Wild West landscape.It a good Western, I've hear people say that it's not a classic...I've never watched a Western in my life, and I genuinely think that the acting is very poor in the earlier John Wayne movies, so in my opinion this is a Western you should definitely watch.",8,0,0,17 May 2010
50 First Dates," Surprisingly funny
","Henry Roth is a womaniser who lives a carefree life in Hawaii until he meets a beautiful girl named Lucy, they talk and laugh, everything seems to go smoothly and then after a long breakfast they say goodbye as Lucy goes to celebrate her dads birthday and promise to catch up the next day for breakfast.When tomorrow arrives, Henry is at the café and Lucy arrives only she has no idea about yesterday....Or who Henry is... Henry then finds out Lucy was in a car crash a year ago which has left her brain damaged and she forgets what happened the day before...The film is a far fetched plot but it has some romantic aspects to it which help the film keep the audience watching; the idea of making contact with a girl that you like is hell...but what if you messed up and tried again tomorrow...only you learnt by your mistakes....trying new scenarios out....I loved those scenes and Adam Sandler does a good job as the romantic lead; the role of Ula was a brilliant bonus, Rob Schnieder is just hilarious and the scene when he gets attacked by Lucy made me laugh out loud.... I loved Lucy's brother Doug....his body building desire and steroid abuse.",9,0,1,15 December 2008
The Hangover," The Hangover
","Four friends go off to Las Vagas for a Bachelor party, only the next morning none of them can remember what happened the night before. What makes matters worse is that the soon to be Groom, Doug; has gone missing...Now Phil, Stu and Alan must re-trace their steps and find Doug and take him to the church in time!I had my reservations about 'Hangover', I just felt that it was not going to live up to the hype; but I was wrong. The storyline is not the most original, but the characters and script, dialogue make it one of the best. The actors are perhaps the greatest asset of the film, Zach, Ed and Bradley have amazing chemistry, something that truly shows in the film, I am especially fond of Stu's song, pure brilliance, Tyson's cameo was quite funny as well...But one thing I loved about the movie was, every now and then there would be a scene in slow motion, with an amazing soundtrack...like the 'Rainman' scene as they come down the steps.Brilliant.",10,1,2,26 April 2011
The Ring," The hype behind this movie is what makes it truly scary
","I remember this film was hyped up so much as the next great scary movie; as good as Exorcist or even better. Naomi Watts is a reporter who investigates the death of her niece and four other teenagers; there is an urban legend about a tape, after watching ti the viewer will experience spooky situations and then die.The film builds up to the end brilliantly but for me the hype was a little too scary; but its wasn't as terrifying as I thought, the film itself is very weird, a woman brushing her hair and it works it keeps the audience watching and trying to work out what is happening. Naomi Watts is brilliant as the reporter and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, she proves that she in fact is a great actress. The other actors are satisfactory and the end is very thrilling and jaw dropping.",7,0,0,7 November 2008
Deja Vu," 'Is she alive or is she dead?'
","The plot is very complex and complicated. Carlin is a cop who is selected to join a team of experts government surveillance team to solve high priority cases. Here he finds a new technology that allows him to look into the past, a reconstruction created by the energy and many other things. Soon Carlin finds out that this is no reconstruction what so ever and sets out to save the girl.Denzel sells the film perfectly, he plays the role with an edge and captures the sadness and confusion that lies within. The action scenes are limited but the chase scene is fantastically done. But the main attraction is the story line. It is very weird and entertaining; it has some great thrills and the audience will find themselves smiling at certain moments when they have a sense of.'Deja-Vu'",9,1,2,7 March 2008
Training Day," Training Day
","Detective Alonzo Harris believes he is in the wild west, having to bend and break rules to keep peace on the streets, but new recruit, Jake Hoyt is not too comfortable with Alonzo's radical approach.This is a film about the mean streets and the things that need to be done to survive, but I did not find this film the least bit interesting, Hoyt character was far too much of a coward, and Alonzo was just annoying, maybe that was Denzel's intention...Eva Mendez was stunning as ever, here her appearance is limited, the one aspect of the film I did find interesting was the deal with the Russians, I felt more could have been emphasised about Alonzo's money problem. Having a bunch of rappers make appearances did not give the film any real credibility..I expected better from Mister Washington....But the end scene was great, as Alonzo met his fate.",7,0,1,17 October 2010
In Bruges," Not everyones cup of tea
","Two hit-men arrive in Bruges, Belgium after a hit that went bad...Hiding out in a town that isn't the most liveliest; there way of life is called into questioning.Colin Farrell is an actor that I didn't pay attention to very much until I saw him in 'Miami Vice' and since then I've seen interviews were he seems to exude a charming and interesting personality. And here displays his acting skill once again.I found the film to be quite slow at first but then you begin to fall for it's dreary charm and realise it's quite funny. I thought the casting was done brilliantly bringing in Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes; each adds something unique and wonderful.The little town gives the film a darker tone, which makes it 'a fairy tale' as Ken would say.Brendan Gleeson plays the hit-man with a taste for the finer things in life , beautifully giving the hit-man character a warmth, while Colin brigs a nervousness; having to battle his emotions constantly...Ralph Finnes is simply dazzling as the real 'ard cockney gangster.I kind of figured out the ending when 'Harry' mentioned what he would do himself if he ever took the life of a child.All in all, an film with amazing acting, script writing and comedy.",9,1,3,10 November 2009
Mulan," Fond memories of my childhood
","Mulan is an only child, daughter to a famed warrior who is called upon once more to fight for his country against invaders, by the Emperor. Mulan knows her father will not survive if he goes to war and so in turn, she disguises herself as a 'Man' and goes in place of her father.There she must train hard and defend China from the invaders, with the help of Mushu, the guardian Dragon of her Ancestors and a lucky bug, Mulan tries to bond with the sexist men, train and learn the ways of a soldier and defend China.I can remember watching this movie over and over again, until I knew scene by scene and the lyrics to my favourite song 'A Girl Worth Fighting For'. So, about a month ago I saw this movie on a channel and thought that it was worth showing to my nieces and nephews. They loved it and in a way I was transported once more into the past as I danced in the living room, with an imaginary Mulan. (I didn't have a lot of friends)My favourite scene was when Mulan faces down the invaders on the Mountain as she charges towards them with a missile. Epic.But twelve years on this film still has great voice actors, great direction, story writing and wonderful songs with even greater animation a genuine testament to Disney's reputation as on of the greatest children's movie studio.",10,1,1,12 July 2010
Unbreakable," A realistic tale of a hero
","David Dunn is a man who has a mundane life until a horrific train crash, soon he is approached by Elijah a comic book artist who believes so strongly that David in fact is a superhero. As David tries to ignore Elijah's insane theories; David's own son takes this to heart and helps his dad prove this is in fact true....This is one of Bruce Willis's finest performances and is only helped to greater heights by the arrival of Samuel.L.Jackson his co-star from Tarantino's Pulp-Fiction. The two play opposite each other perfectly and is only perfected by the direction of M.Night....The ending is almost perfect...David taking up his mantle and battling against the pure evil that is in this world.....a world without true heroes....",9,0,1,23 August 2008
Star Trek," 'Beam me up, Scotty!'
","When I was young, I'd often catch episodes of the very first 'Star Trek' show and since then it's always brought back fond memories, it never made me a 'Trekkie'..but it forged a bond with the inner child. So when I heard about this re-boot, starring a young Kirk and Spock, it excited me..But this is the major flaw for me...It's about the adventures of the U.S.S. Enterprise in an alternate reality. James .T. Kirk decides to enlist in 'Starfleet', so he can fulfil his potential. While Spock grows up trying to figure out his place in the universe, whether it be with the Vulcans or Humans.The special effects were just dazzling, the creatures looked magnificent and the space ships were terrifying as they floated through space. Each member of the cast gave a great performance and added something unique to a mythology which is now legendary. J.J. Abrams who is proving to be quite the force in Hollywood, gives it everything he's got and you can see that as he brings these characters to life once more...I loved the interaction of the characters, especially Chris Pine who immediately caught my attention as the obnoxious and unpredictable Kirk...The only thing I felt that the film failed on was the storyline...bringing the future into the whole thing...This survived on the characters, in my opinion and the whole 'alternate reality' did confuse quite a lot of people....But let's see if there's a sequel and if it's as good as this or even better.",10,6,11,24 October 2009
Underworld," The story of Werewolves and Vampires
","Werewolves at one point were the daylight guardians of the Vampires. But the union of the two resulted in a war that has raged on for centuries.Selene is a 'Death-Dealer' whose sole purpose is to eradicate the Lycans (Werewolves), but her discovery into the history of her kind, makes her question her loyalties.This is a 'Matrix crossed with Vampires and Werewolves' kind of movie that is not meant to question the audience but to excite them, and this movie does that. It has a brilliant opener as Selene stands over the city below and then war ensues in the tunnels.However, the action itself is limited, but focuses on the storyline which in my opinion is its strongest quality, it's dark and intense with Werewolf transformation that leave nothing to the imagination.",8,1,2,27 April 2010
Dawn of the Dead," 'When there is no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the earth.'
","Horror movies aren't really my thing, I find them tedious and repetitive. But I thoroughly enjoyed this film.Yes, I knew where the scary scenes were and anticipated it's arrival and found the whole 'If you get bit you turn into zombie' a little cheesy. But overall the movie had some good bits that kept it strong.I loved the scene when the guys have to turn on the power, very nail biting and exciting; as well as the construction of the vehicles and their run. The end was quite sad, but I guess that's what happens when the world becomes infested with the dead.For an idea that has been done countless times before, it was able to maintain some type of hold on its audience. And didn't spend ages on the discussion of how the dead are suddenly walking the earth and the zombie birth was quite startling.",8,0,0,4 September 2009
Iron Man 2," 'I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.'
","As a comic book fan, it is hard for me to admit if a certain movie has not met the huge expectations that a comic book fan may hold...Batman Begins, Dark Knight held there own, the X-Men movies not so much, Fantastic Four movies were satisfactory....Daredevil was a travesty...Iron-Man was brilliant.....This sequel, is a 50/50 for me... The beginning was brilliant, the middle was slow and random...and the end was satisfactory.The world now knows Tony Stark is Iron-Man and he lives the high life and battles injustice, but the rest of the world wants Tony's suit. Especially the American government.Robert Downey Jr is funny, charming and a little eccentric, which works with the Stark character. Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful then ever before, she plays the caring, at times bossy secretary who is the only reason as to why Stark is still running a multi-billion dollar business. Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell is funny, annoying; which does wonders for our ever growing love for Stark...Mickey Rourke is satisfactory as the villain who wants to destroy Tony Stark, we don't really feel scared. And it seems that Rourke is a combination of 'Whiplash' and 'Crimson Dynamo'...But for me...Don Cheadle seemed to be out of place, I preferred Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Don Cheadle did not deliver lines very well, he did not have that 'No Nonsense' attitude that Rhodey has....Or it did not come across very well. Lastly, Samuel L.Jackson actually played Nick Fury pretty well, while I would have preferred to see Olga Kruylenko as Natalie Romanov, Scarlett Johanson was fine.The middle for me seemed to be a bit slow with random seems, yes we needed to witness the trials Tony faced but it was not dark enough for me. I would have liked to see Tony battle alcoholism, and then hand over his mantle to Rhodes, who would eventually become 'War-Machine' towards the end of the film.....Make it a little closer to the comics.But, the one thing that sold it to me, actually two things...The suit and the epic battle between Iron-Man, War Machine and the Drones.The special effects were simply dazzling and definitely a must see for all comic book fans.",8,24,48,4 May 2010
Public Enemies," At times, intense and raw
","John Dillinger is released from prison and orchestrates an escape for his fellow inmates. Together they descend on banks, robbing their way to the top and taking full advantage of the law...But times are changing and a government agency (which in time will become the FBI), is hot on their tail.This is based on a real person, but I know 'Hollywood' likes to distort the truth to fit the 'story'.Michael Mann has succeeded in the past with 'Heat', 'Collateral' (Which I consider as the greatest movie ever made) and 'Miami Vice', which are just as gritty as this...But I felt here he missed the mark as he concentrated on the 'love' aspect...Johnny Depp provided a satisfactory performance as John Dillinger and Christian Bale gave, what I felt a cold, unmoving portrayal of a agent who vows to find a criminal...The supporting were equally good, giving the main two leads the support needed.I loved the shoot-outs which were at times raw and intense, nothing but the sound of gun-fire, especially in the woods. And the devious escape plans and excellent timing. The soundtrack added a bit of glamour to this at times 'dull' story...Giving it a lift, especially during the robberies...But the one thing I felt Mann could have done was focus on Dillingers early life...How he ended up inside...and how he learnt to pull off the robberies. The end is a little sad, but that's what happened to the real Dillinger and no matter how much we want him to live...He was a bank robber and unfortunately that's the end result; a great scene...",7,0,1,18 October 2009
Madagascar," Hilarious.....
","The plot is simple. A zebra wishes that he was in the wild were he could roam around free and do what ever he likes, but his friends don't understand why? And then they find themselves stranded on a island were the only humans are...dead ones...The film is hilarious and the different variety of characters, penguins, monkeys, Melvin, Alex.. I found David Schiwimmers voice acting a bit week, he seemed to sound exactly like Ross from Friends....and there was no real need for the Hippo....I found Alex just adorable and the jungle king .....hilarious.......A nice kids movie.",7,0,0,30 December 2008
The Girl Next Door," Funny and more importantly...Elisha Cuthbert...
","Matthew is a straight A student who is flying through to one of the most prestigious Universities around, but he is bored with his squeaky clean life and wants some adventure and then comes along Danielle, he falls for her and they begin to connect...Until Matthew finds out that Danielle is a....Pornstar...The film has some obvious references to Risky Business but it does justice and is brilliantly written and acted by the young cast, I loved Eli and Klitz, as Matthew sex hungry friends...More importantly the film is deceiving, you expect to see a whole lot more of Elisha but thats the best part...it keeps you waiting and waiting...One of the best teen movies in a very long time.",9,0,0,24 January 2009
Oldboy," What would you do?
","A man is imprisoned for 15 years and is released; now he must find out why he was imprisoned.The film has some realistic and gritty fight scenes as well as a very strange yet alluring special effects; it is brilliantly done and the lead actor is fantastic at portraying the conflicted individual.The film is a shocking to say the least, the end will have you squirming as the truth is revealed about his lover and how far a vengeful enemy will go to destroy his already chaos filled existence.The fight scene in the long hall is still the main attraction though as he hammers and punches his way through endless numbers of enemies; it is beautifully shot and is definitely a must see.",8,14,24,5 February 2008
Spider-Man 2," Better than it's predecessor, greater than the third
","Peter Parker is no longer a high school student. He's in University having to deal with tests, work, personal life, rent, romance life, aunt, best friend...Oh...And saving the day as your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman. This is exciting and more engrossing than the first or the third, here you see the trouble Peter goes through trying to deal with the pains that come with being a superhero. Tobey Maguire does a fantastic job as Peter Parker, while Kirsten is equally great as the woman who yearns to be loved by him; the supporting cast provide equally stunning performance, but I felt Alfred Molina could have been more vicious..But, you see that Dr.Octopus as the human-being and it works, rather than seeing only the monster...I felt the fight scene on the train was beautifully directed, and definitely silenced me when I thought about the fight scenes in number one. The cinematography returns bringing with it, Spiderman's colourful world.Definitely the best of the trilogy.",10,11,17,27 October 2009
Finding Nemo," A sweet tale of a fathers journey to find his son
","I didn't expect this film to be as funny as it was. But thats what the people at Pixars do, they make a movie designed for children appeal to adults of all ages.Nemo is a clown fish who decides to explore the ocean and gets caught by a fisherman and now its up to his dad to find him.I was mesmerised by the special effects Pixars have definitely exceed all expectations and limits, the ocean effects are just mind boggling and will capture the audience straight away, the detail of the ocean is amazing as well as the characters. The actors do a great job in playing the characters, they bring the sadness and joy of what its like being a fish.I found the fish 'Dory' very lovable who forgets....Brilliant...",8,0,1,31 October 2008
Blade," A perfect adaption
","This is a highly enjoyable horror/action movie. The film takes existing themes. Vampires, Techno music and Martial arts and creates something entirely new. Blade is a half vampire half human who devotes his life into killing the demons of the night; hoping to find the monster that killed his mother.Wesley Snipes plays Blade with a menacing tone and it seems like he enjoys it. The fight scenes are tremendous and well paced, with Wesley ripping out his opponents jugular. (literally).The music is again a bonus it fits in well with the mood of the film.All the cast members play their roles perfectly making it a enjoyable experience for the viewer.",10,6,11,22 February 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The most interesting, tragic and complex character in the universe...And they still wreck it!
","I'm a comic book maniac, so I may ramble on for quite some time..The movie starts off with James Howlett who will go on to become Wolverine, he is a weak child, who watches his father being killed and then finds claws popping out of his knuckles, so he runs off with Victor Creed, his 'brother'...This is in part tied to the comics...Only James runs off with a girl called Rose....Then him and Victor go through wars, eventually recruited by Stryker...And thats when I got confused...The film is inaccurate and just seems to be rushed. Nothing makes sense, there is no real storyline....It would have been interesting to see James deal with his powers while on the run with Rose, which eventually leads to an encounter with Sabretooth. But the filmmakers decide to throw a bunch of characters into the mix, Deadpool, Blob, Cyclops, Silver Fox and more importantly, she is sister of 'Emma Frost'...WHY! I've had people say it was amazing...No its not...The action was silly and the dialogue stunk up the place...A wolverine origin should consist of one character Wolverine. Enough said...I can't explain how disappointed I am as a comic book lover and devoted X-Men fan. Maybe in 10 years it will be re-booted like Batman...",1,2,8,23 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Not as good as everyone makes it out to be...........
","I really went in thinking this was a good, original British comedy.The plot wasn't really any good, Sean Penn is a really funny guy and so is Nick Foster but this film was to over hyped by the British press and it did not deliver.The story with the town killing its own people was a little weird and stupid.But the truth is the trailer was far more funnier then the film itself.The film however does pay homage to other great American action movies and the action scenes were not as good as I thought.Overall....Too over hyped.",4,0,5,7 March 2008
The Mummy," Great family film
",Evelyn and Jonathan Carnahan enlist the help of Rick O'Connell to find the tomb of Imotep a high priest and when they do chaos ensues....The film is just plain fun; the script is a little over-used but the cast make up for that; the actors are all funny in their own way and give a believable performance when dealing with a mummy; Brendan Frasier is genuinely funny; while Rachel is just pretty. The film is action packed and has some great fight scenes especially at the end between Frasier and Imotep; the scenery is beautiful. The film will provide non stop thrills and keep you glued to the screen especially the build up to the mummy.All in all a great family film.,9,3,3,9 August 2008
Constantine," Not as good as the trailer
","Constantine I would say is a average action/comic movie, Keanu Reeves tries hard to make the audience believe he is a tormented soul.The trailer initially caught my attention as it was dark and grim.But the movie is nothing like the comic book; everything is changed, John Constantine is no longer a cockney; instead he is from LA and is Catholic.In the movie Constantine commits suicide and is sent to Hell some how he escapes and begins a path of righteousness.In the comics the character is a fun loving atheist, (in a sense) He never really fights the forces of evil.But I guess Hollywood needed to sell the idea and they tried their hardest.",6,0,3,29 January 2008
Troy," History remembers Heroes, not Kings
","Based on the Greek tale, 'Troy' yearns to find success that has bestowed itself upon Gladiator, and it nearly accomplishes that task but yet it falls short.The story is essentially based on a poem in which two armies go to war because of a woman, not just any woman the beautiful Helen, whose beauty made the God's drool. Troy is a film that tries to invoke the feeling that this is an epic story with great drama but I am unconvinced. The film has a whole host of talented actors yet they all seem to fail in giving a truly remarkable performance, then you have some of the weird accents, it's not entirely English nor American... One of the biggest flaws was Diana Kruger, I found her to be very wooden.One aspect I did find quite entertaining was the fight sequences, when the fake Achilies goes to war, just a magnificent scene and the outcome...as well as Achilies and Hector's final fight, just brilliantly choreographed. Brad Pitt was probably one of the likable characters a man on the verge of being a 'hero', yet he questions himself and his allegiances with a corrupt King..Brilliantly done. Overall a satisfactory attempt at bringing forth the tale of Troy, but rather overshadowed by the great Achilies.",7,1,2,22 May 2011
Terminator Salvation," Not as great as T2 but still good....
","I remember being captivated by T2, as I waited patiently ten minutes before it arrived on the channel. I was blown away with the opening sequence, as Arnie arrives naked. Loved the scene were he saves Connor with a shot-gun and saves him by riding fast on his motor-bike.This movie was in a way a let down, I mean the concept of what happens in the future is quite exciting.Skynet is up and running, it has taken over the world and now only a handful of humans remain fighting against the machines, now Connor has received word that Skynet can be shut down....But it turns out his father, still a child; has been captured by the enemy.This film is mainly about the action scenes, it had explosions, chase scenes and bullets which keep the average viewer happy...But for me the strength lied in the character Marcus Wright.Half-man, half-machine designed to infiltrate the humans, yet he has no idea what he is and when he finally realises, its painful to watch. I also felt the character Blair was a bonus, played by the beautiful Moon Bloodgood, who sizzled on screen from the very first moment.Christian Bale is without a doubt a great actor, but here he seems to have done this film for the money...His acting is as cold as the machines, no emotions and his voice strangely sounds the same as 'Batman'...All in all, a good action movie.",8,1,4,7 October 2009
Spider-Man 3," Far too much to get your head around
","This film as supposed to be an end to a great trilogy, everything was set up for the end, a great battle against Harry and Peter. But I think Raimi was a little disappointed at the fact that he was at the end of the trilogy and decided to put everything in...Not that I blame him, he's a loyal comic book fan who loves the characters unconditionally.The script is very bad, there is far too much, the Spiderman turning bad, the whole Sandman killing uncle Ben; Brock stealing Peters thunder, Peter trying to out due Brock; Brock losing his girl, Peter and Mary Jane, Peter and Harry's deteriorating friendship.The only thing that makes this film half as good as the others is the fight scenes, the chase scene at the start between Green Goblin...the suit was a let down.....Spiderman vs Sandman 1, then 2 and the third big fight but again the whole 'reporting the fight to the public' was so cringing....it was painful, its like when I was a young boy of nine playing with my toys and broadcasting the fight to the whole world.....",5,0,1,7 November 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A Christmas Fantasy/Action Movie
","Its Christmas and we find Hellboy with his dad as they wait for Father Christmas and then Hellboy is captivated by a story about a long lost empire, a hidden army and a exiled prince.Years later Hellboy is fighting the creatures of darkness and finally the story from his childhood is about to become a reality.This film was surprisingly better then the first and was more funnier and much more action packed; I watched it yesterday and as its December the Christmas spirit lurks in my heart and this film for some reasons feels perfect at this time of the year. I loved the scenes with Abe and the princess....And I was glad Abe was given more screen time...Krauss was a brilliant bonus, he made you laugh out loud at his miss-pronunciation. However I think the strength lies in the dark world that Torro brings to life, it beautiful and like something out of your wildest dreams... you can see the magic that lies within this mysterious world.Prince Nauda is an amazing villain he balances the innocence and evil with brilliance and his fighting skills are just outstanding. Hellboy is funnier in this film.......Lastly the fighting choreography is amazing, simply put.",10,11,12,7 December 2008
Cloverfield," How to describe it? Imagine the Godzilla movie, now imagine if the film was based on the scared people running around!
","'How to describe it? Imagine the Godzilla movie, now imagine if the film was based on the scared people running around!' Thats the only way to describe it. New York is attacked by a unidentified monster and the film focuses on a group of friends as they run around in the panic and then decide to rescue another friend.The film starts off a little slow and the camera work is murder on the eyes and mind, but you adapt to the shakiness of the camera and just when the slow start becomes interesting as Rob Hawkins contemplates on whether he should start a relationship with a friend who he has just had sex with.....The attack happens....Panic and hysteria ensue and then we witness the head of the statue of liberty being tossed onto the New York streets.The actors are all brilliant and capture the emotions anyone would experience when the terribly impossible happens, the director definitely knows how to bring in the audience and keeps the monster in the shadows and distance....with the characters constantly saying.'Did you see that?'The special effects are brilliant as the building crumble down and the fire balls scorch through the air, the monsters little bugs that wreck havoc on the people below; the only thing that made this film a little disappointing was the monster itself, it wasn't impressive like on would have imagined.",9,0,1,12 November 2008
Sleepy Hollow," A visual feast which brings forth the dark and Gothic world of Tim Burton
","Sleepy Hollow is the tale of a 'Headless Horseman' who rides through the town of Sleepy Hollow decapitating people who dare walk through the forest at night.Depp plays Ichabod Crane, a detective from New York and a man of science who has been sent to find the killer, but on his arrival he meets the superstitious people of Sleepy Hollow and soon this mere 'tale' becomes a reality.Depp provides a brilliantly dazzling portrayal of a coward trying to do a hero's job, he is funny and sweet as always, Christina Ricci provides the love interest for Crane, she provides a satisfactory job among other great veteran actors, Michael Gough for one...Miranda Richardson is lavish and beautiful.The horsemen is truly scary, and the origin is equally spooky when it is revealed how the horsemen came to meet his end; Christopher Walken provides the menace that only he can without even speaking; and finally the vision of Tim Burton. Burton brings his dark, comic like world to life in this little town and every shot is mastered with perfection by the Gothic architecture that resides...One of those Halloween classics you should watch....Instead of a slasher...",8,1,2,23 October 2008
Silent Hill," Silent Hill should be left alone
","I was very hopeful that this film would capture what the game captured it would spook you with the monsters and ghosts that lurk with the darkest of shadows but this film was very bad.Rose travels to Silent Hill to find the truth behind her daughters dreams, here she encounters the demons of hell in their own turf and must survive.Within the first ten minutes I found the character Rose annoying and irritating, she constantly defied everyones advice and went looking for the ghost town that is Silent Hill. When the cop shoots the demon down, Rose runs into the haunted town school....Why? Stay with the cop whose got a gun! The end was a little disappointing but by then I was already in 'bored' mode; the only thing that was entertaining was the demons....I think that the film would have been better if they changed the characters, gave the cop the lead role....Changing the plot of the game....",3,0,2,9 November 2008
Blade II," 'You obviously do not know who you are ******* with!!!!!!!!'
","Blade must now work side by side with his enemies, the vampires in order to stop a whole new breed of Vampires who devour not only humans but Vampires.This film is a little more comic bookish and does not portray some of the themes of the other movies. I felt that the producers were trying to reach out to a whole new demographic.The film has some good fight scene by a kung-fu legend named Donnie Yen who makes a surprising appearance and does not disappoint.Wesley Snipes manages to portray the vampire again but something that disappointed me was the whole bringing back Whistler and leaving out the doctor from the first film. This was definitely a disappointment but the Vampire, Nomak; makes up for that, the special effects are amazing.A good action movie overall.",8,0,1,22 February 2008

During a award ceremony they attack each other which results in them getting banned from the singles competition.However a loop hole in the rule books allows the two to compete in the partnership devision. With each other.Chazz is a hilarious character who is a sex addict while Macelroy plays a devoted lover of the sport.The dance scenes are hilarious and jokes will keep you laughing, this will definitely put a smile on your face.",8,1,1,4 April 2008
Nacho Libre," Nach-HO!!!!
","Jack Black is a priest with a desire to wrestle but the rules of the Church forbid him from doing what he loves until one day he gets sick and tired of the rules and becomes a wrestler known as Nacho.The film is genuinely funny with an interesting but bizarre plot, Jack Black is lovable and the little kids at the orphanage are sweet and you feel sad for them having the old priest watching over them. the action sequences will have you in stitches as Jack Black wrestles two dwarfs....Many consider this film as not very funny but I think that this is Jack Black at his best, he makes you laugh out loud with his mannerism and wit...",8,0,0,14 November 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," 'You listen very carefully to what I'm about to tell you... I remember... I remember everything '
","Bourne Ultimatum is truly the best of the three.Jason Bourne remembers everything; he just doesn't understand any of it.So Bourne goes looking for the people that created him, made him the killer he is.The film is very well written and acted by Damon; the action sequences are beautifully done; as well as the chase scene.A classic scene I think in the movie is when Bourne goes looking for dash and runs on top of the buildings and crashes through the glass window and lands next to dash; the glass exploding is the finishing touch.!",10,1,3,5 December 2007
Predator," An epic battle between Man and Alien
","Dutch is a commando whose sent to the jungles of Central America to find a cabinet minister, with his old friend Dillon and his team. But on arrival the team discover the remains of an entire USA army sent earlier to do the same job. Something has skinned them alive! Now the team must get to safety as something begins to pick them off one by one.As a child I loved this movie and still to this day, it always brings fond memories, its basically a battle between man and alien in the jungle, a fantastic concept that works brilliantly. The director does an amazing job, in building tension, for the longest time the audience does not see what lurks in the darkness, only an outline of the creature. The action is just fantastic and the end battle is well worth the wait.The second greatest Arnie movie.",10,1,2,19 November 2010
Notting Hill," If only........
",This is a great feel good movie. Will Thatcher is a book store owner who one day meets Hollywood movie star Anna Scott and so her world of showbiz and excitement meets his lonely boring existence. The movie is well written and directed.Hugh Grant plays himself to an extent but I still love his nice guy persona. Julia Roberts simply lights up the screen with her smile and the rest of the cast provide much needed awkwardness and laughs.This film is very nice and will cheer you up even when you're at your lowest. The plot is too good to be true but then again movie stars are people to.A film to watch with that special person in your life.,10,2,5,15 February 2008
Léon: The Professional," Wierdly Charming
","Leon is a hit-man who lives a life of solitude, until one day the family next door are brutally gunned down by a vicious gang led by a corrupt DEA agent. However, only one member of the family survives, Matilda who is taken in by Leon and trained to avenge.I found this movie to be quite charming at times and other times very hard to watch. Jean Reno plays the Leon with a touch of innocence as he lives his life alone and away from the touch of another person and then must adapt and become a mentor.Natalie Portman is impressive as the little girl who has had to grow up a little faster than other girls, I found myself cringing as she uses the word 'lover' to describe Leon. A nice charming film.",7,0,1,11 September 2009
Watchmen," Hello, darkness my old friend. I've come to talk with you again....
","First of all, let me say I am an avid comic book reader and Graphic Novel enthusiast, but never got the chance to read 'Watchmen', so when this movie arrived I made the decision to just watch the film. I understand the vision behind this movie. Just how long can a 'Super-Hero' remain 'Super', until the darkness they have fought all their lives consumes them.It is a tale of desperation, confusion and destruction that leads to the eventual downfall of the hero.An investigation is conducted by Rorschach, a psychotic masked crusader into the murder of a anti-hero named 'The Comedian', as we delve into this world of Superheroes, nothing is what it seems. There is no perfect life for the Superhero, no wonderful alter-ego they can safely resume, after they have saved the day...Just darkness.I genuinely feel for the director and the cast, the movie was not as great as it could be, the Graphic Novel was probably more interesting, but this movie has the wrong cast in my opinion expect for Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earle Haley, the actress who plays 'Silk Spectre 2' does not give a very engaging performance...Neither does anyone.Comedian's burial is perhaps the most beautiful scene of all, a hero's burial is done in secret with only a few military personnel and his superhero friends. It just struck a chord with me as the rain pours and 'Simon and Garfunkel' song 'Sound of Silence' plays...Just stunning.",7,0,4,31 January 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," J.R.R. Tolkien would not be disappointed.........
","Frodo the hobbit is given the immense task of destroying a ring, a ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron to control Middle Earth. And so his dangerous journey begins, along his way he meets enemies and allies ready to give their lives up for what they believe in.The story is simple, its the treacherous path that the characters must take and the obstacles they meet, but what makes this more entertaining and almost magical is Peter Jacksons directing, he uses the special effects to bring this dark, eerie world onto the screen. The scale of the film is huge but what adds to the greatness is the special effects, the evil within this innocent land is brought by the Witch King and his minions as well as the eye of Sauron.All the actors play their respective roles perfectly and no one outshines the other except for Viggo who deserves to be in the limelight for once.The end is one of the finest moments of cinema and brilliantly handled the fight is beautifully choreographed; the fight against the Orcs, the death of Boromir.I especially loved the scene when Aragorn tells Frodo to run and then walks three feet as the camera rises up and the audience witnesses the giant horde of Uruks descending upon him. This moment alone is a key moment in cinema. but overall a great start to a even greater trilogy.",10,0,1,8 November 2008

","RJ a raccoon falls into debt with a grizzly bear who demands that RJ gather him food, or otherwise.... So RJ, befriends family of creatures in hopes that they will unknowingly do the job for him, but this family of woodland creatures have their own problem...There wonderful home is on the brink of extinction as 'Suburbia' begins to move in.This is like all the other animation films that 'Dreamworks' have designed; it is enjoyable and more importantly oddly funny as it's aimed at children. It has the 'Toy Story' plot which is a little annoying...you know...New guy takes the spotlight from the old guy and then we find out new guy's just a phony...I found 'Hammy' hilarious, voiced by the number one funny man Steve Carrell and it's also great to see British comedy legend, Omid Djalili in a Hollywood movie...Bruce Willis was okay as the charming con-raccoon...But the real wonder of this movie is animation once again..Simply spell binding, as you watch the animals infiltrate the house.",9,0,0,14 November 2009
Wanted," 'What the **** have you done lately?'
","James Macavoy plays Wesley, a normal boring office guy who finds out he is the son of a super assassin who was killed in the line of duty and now the 'Fraternity' want to employ Wesley to avenge his father. The film is based on Mark Millar's comic book series; this has some amazing special effects that will keep the average movie maniac glued and the action is...tame...Compared to the HK bloodshed movies... I know a lot of people who thought the end shootout was spectacular...Obviously they haven't seen Collateral, Heat...Matrix...The film was okay and did provide some generally amazing moments and jaw dropping...Anjelina coming out of the tub and even James Macavoy's body was...spectacular...All in all a good film but the plot isn't as great as some of the other comic book series.",7,2,3,13 December 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'Hasta la vista, baby'
","The Terminator is back only this time programmed to save John Connor. This is an all out adrenaline fuelled action film that holds nothing back. Arnold Swazzanagger returns in a role that has since made him an icon across the world.This film is still today one of the best action movies of all time; there many iconic scenes in this film that make it so great, from the Terminator finding suitable clothes to the end scene where he decides to melt himself. The gun fights are amazing and brilliantly choreographed, between Arnie and Robert; the films strength however lies in the tension that is built and the scariness of T-1000; Arnie's accent is also utilised and makes him sound more robotic and cold.....Definitely one of the greatest action movies of all time....",10,2,3,1 November 2008
Salt," Who is Salt?
","Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent who has be accused of being a 'Sleeper Agent', for the Russians. A Sleeper Agent is a spy that infiltrates an enemies country and will wait for a command.I did not have the highest of hopes for this film, as I expected a movie with only big action sequences and that's what I got, Angelina Jolie maybe the 'Queen of Action Movies' right now...But I found it had to believe that she could take out highly trained agents. The overall plot is an interesting one, but it never actually entices one, maybe because it just jumps from one action scene to another.I did figure out the ending half way through the movie and it did not hold any extra surprises...All in all, another watchable action movie.",6,0,2,20 November 2010

The plot is similar to Rear Window and for those who don't know who Alfred Hitchcock is....Read a book! or watch a real movie!(coughs)This is similar to the plot of the Simspons when Bart spies on his neighbour, Ned....Remember? No....Where have been?The film is very intense and at times scary with a great cast who do justice for a plot that has already been done and almost killed by pop culture. Shia....I bow down, sir. Shia is amazing as the paranoid voyeur who is convinced about the grizzly things that are happening and also the lovable idiot.I loved the comedy between Ronnie and Kale....and sat with my mouth wide open when Ronnie....visits Mr. Turners house....Simply....Thrilling.",8,1,3,25 November 2008
Edward Scissorhands," Twenty years on, it still brings a tear to your eye...
","Joyce is a housewife who one day out of desperation to sell products goes up the hill, were no one dares to go. There in the Gothic, deserted mansion, she finds Edward. Edward is different to most people, he has scissors for hands....Joyce decides to take Edward home with her, and a beautiful friendship is born with the neighbourhood and love blossoms between Edward and Kim, Joyce's daughter.I'm ashamed of myself for not writing this review far earlier, because it is one of my favourite movies, I spent every Christmas watching this movie with my Aunt, and now, well today..I watched it once again, no longer a child of 8, 9 or 10..But 22, and I still found myself on the verge of tears. Edward Scissorhands, is arguably Burton's finest, followed by 'Batman and Batman Returns'.What makes this film irresistibly amazing is the character Edward, who possesses a child like interest in everything around him, his origin is even more sad, being created by the lonely Vincent Price. To the tender love story between two hearts in the snow... I can speak on and on, about the beautiful poetry of this movie, but I'll finish on the note that this is a 'Gothic Fairy Tale' not to be missed.",10,0,1,25 December 2010

But the psychopath left one last present for LA, a bomb.Using state of the art surgery Sean becomes Troy and goes into a maximum security prison, but problems surface when Caastor wakes up and becomes Sean Archer.The film is an adrenaline pumped action flick which shows a hail of bullets and blood, Travolta plays Castor with pure delight as he jumps around and does his one-liners, while Nicholas plays the man completely alone in the world.John Woo definitely brings Hong Kong cinema style movies to Hollywood.",9,5,8,29 January 2008

","Bob is a journalist who goes looking for super soldiers who could use psychic abilities for warfare and finds the weird Lyn Cassady who reveals a story that goes back to the Vietnam war and uncovers the secrets of a whole new type of military strategy.I read on magazines that this film was supposed to be quirky and hilarious, but the only time I actually laughed was when the General ran into a wall...Other then that, I didn't find it funny....But I did find it interesting, yet the absence of an actual plot made it hard to pay interest.Like I said before, 'Quirky doesn't always mean 'Funny'.",1,21,33,21 August 2010

The give the comic book characters depth, emotions and a voice that reaches out beyond the screen. What I loved more was 'Spiderman' the suit was amazing and cinematography was even greater as it brought the comic book world forth. I felt that the fight scene could have been much better, but was satisfied with Sam Raimi's take on this beloved comic book legend.",10,1,2,27 October 2009
Collateral," The Greatest Movie Ever Made
","Collateral is probably my all time favourite films. I watched this film on the plane and was thrilled to find Tom Cruise almost playing Vincent with total ease. Max is a cab driver with big dreams; one night he meets Annie a lawyer and there's definitely a spark between them both. As Max counts his earnings a man named Vincent arrives looking for a cab and leaves seeing that Max is busy; Max shouts out to Vincent and calls him in, making a big mistake; Vincent reveals he needs to make a couple of stops to close a real estate deal and soon it is revealed Vincent in fact is a contract killer. Max watches as Vincent does only what he can do best, kill, this night will change them both.Mann shows the seedy under belly of LA; and the criminals that run it. Leave yourself on 'Cruise Control' when it comes to this film, all the characters play their part perfectly no matter how small or big; the best bit of the film is the Club Fever shoot-out. In my view this is the greatest fight scene and gun play I have ever seen, gun control by Cruise is phenomenal, he oozes coolness while shooting the Korean Gangsters; the music by Paul Oakenfold is perfect it catches the whole thrill and 'cool' of Cruise.Overall this film can never be topped!",10,2,3,5 December 2007

A lot of my friends had no idea what it was before this film came out; I felt a sense of pride, explaining it to them.Remember one last thing, Winning is winning.",10,11,15,24 January 2008
Ocean's Eleven," Danny Ocean is the definition of cool

Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts, Mac, Garcia and Cheadle are only a few to mention.Danny Ocean has served his time and plans on doing another job, a job on his wife's new boyfriend and assembles his team to rob the biggest casino in Vagas. The cast are perfect, they provide great performances and make the audience laugh and hold you on the edge when attempting to rob the place.Clooney seems to be playing himself in this movie which is perfectly fine, while Pitt takes on the role of a comedian and delivers.One for the collection.",10,0,2,14 June 2008
Tropic Thunder," 'I'm the dude playin' the dude, disguised as another dude!'
","To get into the mindset of soldiers, a director takes his five leading actors to the jungle so they can experience the real conditions that there characters are going through. However, the director ends up taking his crew to a real war zone...And now his actors will have to become their characters, in order to survive.There's been a lot of controversy about this movie about Robert Downey jr's character and the word 'retard' being constantly used...But let's face it, it's comedy..It's not meant to be offensive..It's satire.There is such witty dialogue in this movie and the actors deliver each line with great comedy timing, more surprisingly we see, Tom Cruise...Going into the movie, I had no idea he was in it; so it was a pleasant surprise.The end fight scene is a little disappointing but you can forgive them, as the middle half is just pure gold, as the prima-donna's wonder what they are going to do; now that the director has been blown to pieces....And the 'Lance' conversation is just pure gold, with Jack Black just killing the audience with his facial gestures...Matthew McConaughey is surprisingly quite funny in this as well...'At least you get to choose yours'",10,1,2,13 November 2009
Quantum of Solace," Just look at the opening...The first glimpses of the Aston Martin and the music set the tone for this dark and exciting movie
","I previously commented on this movie. But since then, I bought the DVD and have watched it with pure admiration for every single second.Following the events of Casino Royale, we see Bond who has been betrayed by his lover, and so James locates the men responsible for this treachery, realising in the process that it was not an act of betrayal by Vesper, but love.This film has some excellent scenes and some disappointments but it captivates you in a way that no other Bond film has been able to do.I will quickly state were I felt the movie failed. The dialogue was not as riveting as previous films and the 'Rouge Agent' aspect has been done before. Dominic Greene was a good villain, but would have liked to seen someone more menacing and cunning...Now the 'great' aspects, within the first second we the audience are pounded by the heavy, dark and moody music. And catch glimpses of the Aston Martin, which gives it a more menacing look and then we witness one of the greatest openings to a movie...Bond drives violently in a narrow tunnel, trying to get away from the baddies as they shoot and crash their way through. Bond rips the door of his Aston open by swerving violently and rushes through the traffic, eventually shooting his enemy off the road and then drives into a hide-out. Opening his boot, he stares at his hostage and smiles; followed by the tingling music.And then he chases a rogue agent across the rooftops of Italy and hangs from a rafter as he tries to grab his gun in time. The plane scene was a little disappointing while the end is a visual extravaganza.The introduction of Camille is done brilliantly and I can simply say that she is probably my favourite 'Bond Girl'. Tough, intelligent and beautiful. The theme song is also a bonus and how the desert becomes a woman...A visual feast...Those who complain that there are no gadgets, or that its too action packed. The truth is that the drama aspect of a 'Spy-Movie' has been long gone... I would like to see gadgets come along in the future, something small....Not a car that turns invisible... But a 'Gadget-less' Bond is still exciting...Looking forward to the third.",10,5,16,9 July 2009

Two million dollars to be more precise.Moss steals the cash only to return to the crime scene, through curiosity only to be chased away by the drug runners....In turn the drug cartel bring in a man named Anton Chigurh, an assassin who is on a whole new level of crazy.Moss tries to run from the psychopathic killer, which seems to be impossible...While Sheriff Ed tries to find Moss in time, in order to save his life.I knew this was a book based movie, from the amazing Cormac Mcarthy. The acting is very natural almost, from the majority of actors; Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Kelly Macdonald and even Woody Harrelson. While Javier Bardem sizzles as the killer who seems to have a screw loose....The film starts off slow but picks up pace as the chase begins and will keep you on the edge of your seat..But the ending is a little disappointing but the film finishes by taking away in type of closure from the audience, which I strangely find soothing.A real man's film...",9,3,4,6 July 2009
District 9," Simply amazing..
","Aliens have arrived on our planet..and being the wonderful humans we are, we keep them isolated from the human population, we bully and murder them with our hate...Until one day, a human begins to turn into one of them.... One of the best things about this movie is the aliens, or prawns as they are called...a derogatory title placed upon them....The aliens are so life-like and their mannerisms as well as there replies are just hilarious to watch.At times I did find it quite hard to watch when the aliens were being discriminated...But towards the end, you feel excited as the aliens begin to rebel...I felt that the documentary style of direction was quite interesting as you got a different view from different people about the events taking place...The end was a little sad....",9,0,1,14 January 2010
Batman Begins," 'Does it come in black?'
","I remember seeing the new Batsuit on a Empire magazine; I did not like it at all.'Looks like something the army would create', is what I said.Bruce Wayne lives a happy childhood, born to one of the most wealthiest families in Gotham City; he spends his days playing with the house maid's daughter, Rachel.However his life is about to change when he fall into a old family well; and here he encounters something that will become a fear and a weapon.A Bat.Later on Bruce accompanies his parents to the Opera where his bat phobia returns and he leaves; as his parents exit the opera house they are mugged and in the process Bruce's parents are killed.Bruce grows up alone with only his family butler, as a guardian.As he grows older he becomes more and more disillusioned and wants revenge on the criminals responsible for the death of his parents. This thirst for revenge ends his friendship with Rachel and a meeting with a local gangster, Carmine Falcone; leaves the young man with a dilemma.How can you bring someone to justice, who is feared? Bruce leaves Gotham and goes travelling and meets Ra's Al Ghul; leader of a vigilante group. Bruce learns valuable lessons, especially the one thing that will help him the most. Fear.As Bruce realises the difference between revenge and justice he finds himself in a predicament; Ra's Al Ghul is a killer, something Bruce is not. Bruce destroys Ra's Al Ghul fraternity and arrives back in Gotham ready to fight the evil that infests the City.He discovers the Bat Cave; finds a symbol that he can use, a Bat. He finds high-tech weapon and armour that was designed for the army and uses this to aid him, he tracks down gangster Carmine Falcone and brings him to justice only to learn theirs a bigger threat, Scarecrow.A psychopathic psychologist; as Batman wages war with the insane, he finds his alter-ego, The Batman becoming more and more dominant.Nolan brings the Batman origins into the light in this movie; the origins of the Bat have never been revealed on a live action movie.Christian Bale portrays the role of Multi-Millionaire with pure elegance and plays Batman with a ferocity. Actos such as Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and even Katie Holmes hold there own, against the lead.But Cillian Murphy is a pure treat as the sadistic and insane Scarecrow; he oozes evil.The whole army suit is a brilliant idea, after watching the film it made perfect sense, (were else would Batman get his stuff?) and the Tumbler is the finishing touch. It is big and scary, perfect for the Dark Knight. This is above all an origin story and the best origin story, it provides satisfactory answers to question that fans have asked for a long time.The fight scenes were a little off, they seemed to all over the place but then again thats how a bat fights.But it is the whole use of Fear that stands out; the enemies thinking of the hero as a non-human creature is perfect especially when he starts to snag the bad guys one by one.Fantastic!",10,1,2,13 December 2007

","Frank is a special type of courier, he provides his unique driving skills to criminals who need to be transported somewhere or need something transported.He is a man of rules and does not like to break them, until he accidentally opens a moving package which contains a beautiful Chinese woman named Lai. And so the bad guys pursue them and Frank must do what he was trained to do, survive.The film has some good strong moments.Jason portrays his role with good comedy timing and Shu Qi is beautiful as always, great fight scenes.

X-Men: The Last Stand," A great end to a franchise
","The X-Men must fight a new cure developed by humans to stop the mutant gene from developing.The film is a little less about Wolverine which is good and more about the characters, something I found enlightening, yet some characters have back stories which are nothing like the comic book.Juggernaut and Charles Xavier which is probably the main one.The film has great scenes however were Wolverine fights Spike in the forest and the climax battle is definitely one to remember integrating a scene from the comic books, Wolverine killing Jean.Overall it is a good end to a well loved comic book adaption, although we could have seen a little more of Cyclops, who had no real role in any of the movie's.Hope to see a fourth or maybe a restart to the franchise.",8,0,2,22 February 2008
Hellboy," Hellboy comes to the big screen finally...
","Towards the end of World War Two the Nazis out of desperation turn to the black arts, hoping to bring something out from the deepest depths of space. But in the midst of the ceremony the Americans arrive and stop them...However during the brief time the portal has been open, something has got through the rift. A red monkey like creature with a massive right arm. Still an infant the creature is taken in by the Americans who name him Hellboy and train him to become a protector for the world.The film is based on the comic books by Mike Mignola and brings the short stories to life; the concept is very original and has a variety of wonderful creatures and people. Del Torro does a terrific job in bringing this dark and lavish world to life with blinding special effects and tongue in cheek humour which works brilliantly for the character. The cast ll provide a satisfactory job in bringing well loved characters to life....Hope the sequel is as good or better.",8,0,0,14 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The greatest of the trilogy
","Set straight after the 'Fellowship', we witness the dark power of 'Sauron' begin to reach out from 'Mordor'. Merry and Pippin have been taken by the Uruk-Hai, while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are hot on their trail. Frodo and Sam with the help of Golum continue their journey towards the volcano of Mordor. And an old friend returns.More importantly, Sauron has waged war on the people of Rohan and now the fight begins at 'Helms deep'.I personally think that this is the greatest of the trilogy, as we the audience now know each character and are thrown deep into the war for 'Middle-Earth'.The actors all provide great performances, each captivates the audience and more importantly allows other new actors to take centre stage, Eowyn, Faramir.But I strongly feel that it is the work of 'Peter Jackson' that prevails above all else, you see his love for the books as it explodes from the screen. The tension that slowly begins to build up as we hear of the impending doom that the Uruk-Hai bring with them from the main characters. I felt that the battle at 'Helms-Deep' was executed magnificently, you felt each rain droplet, each roar, each swipe of a blade as it decapitated the monsters.Throughout the film there is also an amazing soundtrack that runs through it; giving the film a wonderful quality.Truly magnificent.",10,0,2,10 November 2009
I Am Legend," A different type of horror/action movie
","Robert Neville is the last man alive in NY city. A cure to cancer turns out to be a disease that turns people into 'Vampires' (Vampires however is never mentioned in the movie) The film shows Nevilles daily routine and how he tries to keep sane in a world were there is no one else. I loved the scene with Sam the dog.Will Smith plays the role to a satisfactory quality and this is coming from one of his fans.Certain times of the movie you will find yourself at the edge of your seat and the first time the audience sees the Vampires is very scary.Warning! Spoilers Below.Especially when Will goes looking for his dog and sees a nest of Vampires with their backs turned to the audience.The opening scene is amazing you get a feel what the world would look like if humans disappeared, the idea of silence in a busy city is frightening.The special effects overall are amazing.I understand as to why people don't like this film, but it is mainly about the characters daily routine.",8,0,2,21 May 2008
School of Rock," Jack Black rocks!
",A great comedy.Jack Black does the cliché teacher role in Hollywood were a con-man takes over a class to achieve his dream or goal and then falls for the class.The scenes with Black interacting with he children is fantastic and the kids seem to be genuinely good actors.Its not the average kids comedy but its much better then some of the films that are on now.It has some great moments and some sweet scenes and mostly scenes with laughter.,10,0,0,22 March 2008
Kick-Ass," A different kind of Superhero
","Being a life long comic fan its quite refreshing to see a Superhero movie that brings something new into the genre. Kick-Ass is dark, sad, action packed and above all, hilarious....A superhero movie thats actually funny..it's unheard of! Dave is the school nerd who dreams of being a superhero...and then one day he decides..'why not?' What happens next changes everything, as Dave becomes Kick-Ass and takes his justice to the streets...it's not all glamorous..he realises being a crime-fighter is dangerous stuff, but it seems that Kick-Ass has inspired some, who are teetering on the brink of sanity,'Hit-Girl and Big Daddy', a Father and Daughter whose lives revolve around catching criminals.It's a very funny film, no doubt. Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz set every scene on fire, they just play off each other so well and deliver some brilliant dialogue. The fight scenes are brilliant to watch, Kick-Ass especially as he bring down thugs. Brilliant.",10,1,4,16 February 2011

","Dr. Martin Harris travels to Berlin with his wife Liz, after remember that he's forgotten a suitcase he leave his wife at the hotel and goes back to the airport only to end up in a car accident.When Martin awakes from a coma, he finds out that there is someone else who has replaced him as Martin Harris...Why is this happening? And is he the real Martin Harris? I felt the overall plot was quite intriguing but there were certain plot holes within the film. Liam Neeson has become the action star for a new generation since his outing as a highly skilled spy in 'Taken' and he does a satisfactory job here as a man trying to find answers. The ending has been done before in a few films but its still nice to see Liam beat the living daylights out of the bad guy. January Jones and Diane Kruger do little to move the plot forward and their characters but Liam makes up for it. There are moments when the character Liz seems scared of the other 'Martin Harris' but its never explained why when we find out her connection to the fake one...Watchable.",7,0,2,10 June 2011

The film has scenes were you genuinely dislike him but there are scenes that will have you smiling as prejudices are thrown out the window when people get to know each other better.The film isn't over the top action sequences, it has a realistic touch and makes you wish that there was a man like Walt around your neighbourhood...Not because he's racist but because he stands up for the little guy...A great film...",10,2,8,23 January 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," 'Flame on!!'
","This is slightly better then the first.Doctor Doom returns to help the Fantastic Four in dealing with a new menace named Silver Surfer (who is a hero in the comics) The film is good but not great like many critic have said. It does deliver but the plot is a little one dimensional, the sub-plots are not very entertaining. But the Johnny and Thing's scenes are an upside.Fantastic Four are not the most amazing characters of the Marvel world and so they suffer in terms of villains and plot. What critics forget is that this is a superhero movie.The actors do try a little harder to give the characters a little more depth, but Julian Mcmahon is the diamond in the bunch; he oozes evil; while the special effects keep getting better; the final fight is a good scene. And the end is predictable, Dr.Doom's costume is definitely a plus, the Silver Surfer could have been used on another franchise, quite possibly his own, being an entity beyond the reaches of superheroes.The cloud representing Galactus was pretty impressive and clever, I was expecting a gigantic man who sits on a massive chair.Overall....just another good superhero movie.",8,1,2,22 February 2008
Transformers," Action packed and brings the TV show some justice
","This is a fantastic action/comic book style movie. Cybertron is a planet far away were a civil war rages on between Autobots and Decepticons. Soon this war is brought to earth and the action only gets better as it goes on. I was a passer by of the Transformers cartoon but was an avid fan of Beast Wars. I went to watch this film and came out happy it was action packed and had a great cast who play their own parts perfectly. Shia is fantastic as the confused boy who finds out his car is a alien. Megan is just as good as Shia's affection.Now the robots.Larger then life and incredible to look at, the robots my favourite being is Ironhide and Bumblebee while the decepticons are simply scary. Megatron is brought to life immediately by the sheer size of him, Hugo Weaving is menacing as always by proving the grim voice needed. Fantastic film to watch for the Summer (thats already gone)",10,3,4,15 February 2008

Wimbledon. Bettany is funny and endearing as Peter, a fading champ who wishes to win the big one. Kirsten Dunst is sweet as the upcoming star with great performances from all involved.The Tennis play was amazing, beautifully shot; the close up of Bettany's eye was amazing...revealing a deep sense of concentration reminds me of 'Eye of the Tiger'....A sweet romantic comedy...Especially for the Wimbledon season.",8,1,2,28 June 2008
Donnie Brasco," 'Forgedda' 'bout it!'
","This is film is based on a true story; so there are no car chases and great shooting scenes.Lefty is a low level hit-man who has just taken on an apprentice, Donnie Brasco. Who just so happens to be a FED. Who will change the course of the Mafia's history.The film is subtle in terms of the mannerism of gangsters; none of the gangsters are larger then life. They remain hidden.Al Pacino plays lefty with sadness of a man trying to become someone before its too late. Depp holds his own playing the double agent.The sad thing is that Pistone who is Donnie Brasco at the end of his undercover job only receives a thanks, nothing else.A good realistic interpretation.",8,1,1,24 April 2008

Jigsaw has finally been found but the cop in charge finds himself in a dilemma when he realises his son is in Jigsaw's sick game. With all the people he has deliberately placed in prison for a result.This film was more entertaining and more thrilling then the first....Jigsaw is more humane in this film, he is ill and looks for his work to be recognised and so the cop finds himself trying to outsmart the extremely cunning killer....The end is a little shocking and will keep you on the edge of your seat like the first....",6,0,0,29 October 2008
Ip Man," Fierce and Fantastic
","Yip Man is a practitioner of Wing Chun and carries himself with great dignity, he spends his days perfecting his art as he beats down challengers with great skill. But then the Japanese arrive during the Sino-Japanese war and Yip Man is forced to become a common labourer, but here he encounters a Japanese general who yearns to fight someone just as great as him, enter Yip Man.Let me first of all say that every fight scene is incredible, it is beautiful to watch, its elegant and fast, but at the same time is eye boggling and exhilarating. The storyline is perhaps in my view the most powerful part of this movie, it is wonderful interwoven and the fight scenes are simply a bonus.Donnie Yen is the main talking point, he is utterly spell binding as the legend that is Yip Man, he physically cannot be out best in today's Hong Kong cinema and honestly, put some of the greats to shame as he lays waste to his opponents.Utterly spellbinding.",10,0,1,2 February 2011

","Two criminal brothers are on the run, they're only hope is to get to Mexico, and they do so, by making a family of three face the end of a gun...Once in Mexico, the brothers decide to relax at a strip club...However...all is not what it seems...I recently decided to watch this film, and I'm left in the middle of the fence. The film has a brilliant opening with George Clooney, giving a superb performance as Seth. It's one thing, when the bad guy's ugly...But when you're as good looking as George Clooney, its even more frightening. The rest of the cast were fine, they did not add much.I loved the twist in the middle of the film, but felt it ruined a pretty good movie..The drama from the brothers and the kidnapped family was quite riveting, but then the Vampires, made it a little ludicrous...All in all, a film that will entertain.",7,0,0,29 October 2010
Clash of the Titans," Awful from the first second
","Perseus must fight the Gods to save the mortals...That is the basic premise of this film. I instantly knew that this film was going to be bad, not because it was a remake..But because the trailer was just awful, rock music with action that was disappointing...And then the film did exactly the same.The plot too simple, as well as inaccurate to the tales of the Greek gods, there was no Kraken..which seems to be only added because of its appearance in POTC,and once more Hollywood gets the character of Hades wrong, making him the power hungry villain, something that was never mentioned or hinted in the Greek mythologies. While, the addition of an Angel and Jinn make things even more awkward...Every actor failed to deliver a good strong performance, I'm surprised at Liam Neeson, dull and robotic are the words to describe him. While Ralph Fiennes is just annoying with his raspy voice, the lead actor Sam Worthington was very good in Terminator Salvation, but now I am convinced he cannot act, he is just another actor filling in the 'Action Hero' role. Gemma Arterton does not add much to the plot, or performance wise, similar to her role as Stawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace. But there is one plus, Alexa Davalos, she plays her role as Andromeda well and she's beautiful.Awful remake...Awful.",1,2,3,18 October 2010
Black Hawk Down," One the greatest war movies ever made...
","I don't know how much of this is fact or fiction, but I can say as a audience member that this probably one of the most intense war movies I've ever seen. It has no political agenda, were the solider tries to Americanise the rebels or saves hundreds of innocents..It's simply about surviving.The plot is the following. A group of elite soldiers arrive in SOmalia to capture a war lord, which is a success...However this is were the film only begins.An entire city descends on the soldiers with RPG's and weapons, to stop them, leaving soldiers dead and wounded...And we witness their battle for survival...The film is raw and intense, with some amazing shoot-outs that leave nothing to the imagination as soldiers are blown to pieces and shot to smithereens. We become attached to certain characters that will either die or become severely wounded.I found the sequence were the Black Hawks fly over the city mesmerising, the black smoke that clouds the actions of the enemy, the roaring noises of the mob, the firing of the gun and recoil...Personally I became attached to Eric Bana's character, Hoot as he tries to fight threw the enemy in order to save his comrades..Simply one of the greatest war movies ever made...",10,3,6,7 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Not as great as Batman Begins, but still great....
","This review has been swirling in my mind for ages, I watched it at the Cinemas and didn't know quite what to make of it...I was a big comic book fan, a great lover of Batman Begins, so when the trailer arrived I was in awe of Heath Ledger as the Joker and impressed by Christian's development of the Batman.....Gotham City is in turmoil as the events of Batman Begins have thrown everything into chaos, people are dressing up as Batman and fighting crime with guns, while some of Arkham's inmates are still on the loose, and the leading criminals in the City are terrified of the thing that lurks in the shadows. Until a man arrives who doesn't seem to be afraid of the Batman, a man who dresses up as a clown...a man who calls himself the, Joker.Joker unleashes hell on Gotham City torturing and killing people, blowing up buildings all in the hope of catching Batmans attention and he does, as well as Harvey Dent's, the new DA.I felt that there was too much hype building up towards this film and there were so many non-fans suddenly jumping on the band-waggon that it made it hard to distinguish if this film was truly great....Heath Ledger's portrayal was truly magnificent, he went out as a great Hollywood actor, he portrays a man truly lost to madness, a man who wants to understand why Gotham celebrates another maniac? While Aaron Eckhart plays a satisfactory Harvey Dent, he is a man who is truly trying to change things. Gary Oldman is as fine as the first, Michael Caine takes a backseat in this film but hopefully he will return in the third with a bigger part. Morgan Freeman becomes a more pivotal place within Batman's side, and does justice toward the end. Maggie Gylenhaal was okay...I felt the role needed Katie Holmes.... And finally Erice Roberts as Sal Maroni, Eric did a tremendous job playing the mobster; he oozes with charm out of every pore... And finally I come to Christian Bale. Bale takes his character to a new level, his Bruce Wayne, is broken up into two people, the brooding 'Wayne' who spends his days stitching himself back up, and staring into space with the pain he constantly feels and the Bachelor 'Bruce', a man totally ignorant of the things that are happening around him...This Batman is much more violent then the last, he's had enough and will throw you off a building if he has to...A creature that is losing the fear that he instilled in the hearts of his victims to the popularity.....And finally Christopher Nolan, Nolan focuses on the action a little more and create breathtaking sequences like the Bat-pod chase, the truck flip, Batman standing on top of a huge building and then leaping off... Nolan shows Gotham in a more brighter role, as the City gleams with happiness, almost happy at what has happened in the previous film.....I leaped out of my seat towards the end when Batman takes on the SWAT team and the criminals in order to save the innocent, absolutely beautifully choreographed.All in all, a great sequel...but hopefully will return to the roots in the third...",10,2,5,23 January 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Everything is beginning to change...
","I'm not a Harry Potter fan and have never picked up a Harry Potter book, but I find the concept quite interesting as the world of the wizard becomes more fascinating as each book comes out...Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts after 'Goblet of Fire' and tries to convince people that 'Voldermort' is alive but no one believes him and so, the Ministry of Magic put in place a new head-teacher, one who even angers Hermione...I am not really going to write much because it's a kids film, that's all..It's nothing spectacular..It's something to pass the time...The special effects are amazing as always...Daniel Radcliff in my opinion doesn't do Harry Potter any justice any more...because the character's supposed to be coming of age...He is supposed to be frustrated angry..Yet every time Daniel gets cross on-screen..It's not convincing..Rupert Grint is quite funny...While Hermione loses her 'Teacher's Pet' title, by becoming more free... I liked the change of pace..The movies are beginning to change...become darker and I totally understand that...But the lead's not very convincing.",7,1,2,7 December 2009

","The toys are back for a sequel. Woody is stolen by a toy merchant, and in his absence Buzz decides to rescue him.Here we see a role reversal of the first film, but it still works.The characters are now more funnier. Some scenes will have the audience burst out in laughter while some scenes make the audience think.The graphics are much more improved then the first and the story line seems to be much more deeper in terms of character.My favourite scene is the Zurg and Buzz encounter.Hilarious.

The only thing I liked was Ken Leung I found him to be very watchable and have liked seeing his films....The end is however rewarding for someone who has sat through the blood and random screaming.....Not the best film to watch at Halloween but will satisfy some...",4,2,3,29 October 2008

Literally.Carl gathers millions of balloons filled with helium and goes up, heading for South America, but there is one tiny problem....Russell, is in the flying house as well..I was close to tears during the opening of the movie as we see Cark's entire life flash past, in beautiful little scenes, bringing joy and sadness that reaches out to all ages, children and adults. The animation is simply spellbinding, but for me, it is the story that makes this great, it's a tale of unfulfilled dreams, constantly interrupted by the problems of life.....More importantly the comedy moments are just pure genius...The supporting characters are equally funny, Doug, Evan, Alpha-Dog.....simply the greatest animated movie ever made.",10,0,2,28 January 2010
From Hell," A nice take on Jack the Ripper
","In the Victorian Era, London's streets are a dangerous place. Not because of rapists and gangsters but because of a man known only as the Ripper. Jack the Ripper.This is a good take on a English Legend.Jack the Ripper was a serial killer who would find prostitutes on the streets of London and persuade them to come with him and then kill them violently; in this Depp plays a clairvoyant/inspector and searches for the man and finds a web of conspiracy.This is very interesting and at times thrilling.Depp is magnificent as ever and Heather Graham provides a good enough supporting role.",8,0,1,24 April 2008
Inside Man," Very smart
","This is a very smart film. A robbery is in progress and police surround the robbers only now the robbers have to get out. Only thing is...who said about leaving; the film is full of twists and turns and creates a sense of belonging with some of the best heist movies out there. Denzel shines as a cop who is dealing with corruption charges and a failing relationship and now he has to deal with a very clever robber. Clive Owen is brilliant as the scheming robber who has a moral fibre in his corrupt soul, he brilliantly hides the brilliance of the character hidden with stares and glares. The film keeps teasing the audience when they think they've got the story figured out; the end is a classic, it keeps the audience smiling and gasping.",9,1,2,7 March 2008

However unknown to the public is the this is all a front, for you see they are assassins, the greatest in their field. More importantly neither one knows that the other is a trained killer...and that they're rivals...When the eventual truth is found out, they must decide whether on separating or seeing this problem through like a real marriage...The film has some genuinely funny moments but the best scene in the movie however is the fight scene between Brad and Angelina, its a great fight...with guns and a fist fight that makes you laugh out loud....The ending is satisfactory for a movie that was ignored by the press.",8,1,3,31 January 2009
War of the Worlds," The ending ruins this great film
","Something rises up from the ground, a tri-pod which begins to decimate everything in it's path and it's up to Ray Ferier to get his children to safety.This is a remake of the original that is based on the book and is set in America. First of all this is a Steven Spielberg movie and, this man never falls short of amazing; he dazzles us with the special effects and cgi that made Jurassic Park amazing. The build up to to the arrival of the aliens is beautifully handled, as we see a storm begin to brew and lighting strikes not once, but twice. The earth begins to crumble and giant tri-pods emerge...The Tri-pod thing was a little disappointing but Steven kept to the original as close as possible... Tom Cruise gives up the 'hero' mantle to play a father whose made mistakes and he succeeds in a way, although you expect him to save the day and he does...Dakota Fanning is wonderful as the little girl and she displays her amazing acting abilities here once again..The scene were Ray is running as the dust of fried humans falls is simply stunning and the river of the dead, freezes you..The ending for me was the really disappointing thing..Everything turns out great..Ray's moody son, who runs off to fight with the army arrives home before him...Like I said...The ending ruins a great film.",8,1,3,13 November 2009

But I thoroughly enjoyed it...There are a series of love stories from the Prime Minister to a fading Rockstar to a writer and even involves a horny teenager...One of the best scenes of the film is seeing Hugh Grant dance, he hasn't got the greatest range, he can't do serious roles, nor pure comedy but the man has an air about him when it comes to 'Rom-Com's'...I personally found the Colin Firth storyline the most touching...love needs no translation as he falls for his maid...But the sad thing was seeing Liam Neeson play a man whose just lost his wife..Sadly he suffered the same fate as his character...it brought a tear to my eye...All in all, a fantastic Christmas romance movie...",9,1,3,21 December 2009
30 Days of Night," Underrated mainly because of an underrated actor....
","In Alaska for 30 days, sun light is absent and in this darkness; the creatures of the dark arrive to feast. Based on a comic book, the movie brings the comic book feel with gory scenes and special effects.Josh Hartnett is a talented actor but is underrated mainly because of his good-looks and shy personality; he plays a sheriff, brother and husband. Another actor who is underrated is Ben Foster; here he is known as the Stranger who creates a sinister vibe of what is yet to come.The scenery is amazing and shows just lonely the Alaska landscape is and sends a chill down ones back when you think of the plot, of the movie. As the film progresses the theme becomes clear, its survival.The camera work is brilliant as the audience sees the massacre that is taking place in the town that is defenceless against the Vampires. The scenes in the whiteout is perfect it shows that the humans may not have super strength but they have one thing, logic...The most deadliest weapon of all.A good horror movie to watch.",8,1,3,28 June 2008
Man on Fire," Man on fire
","Creasy is a bodyguard who has one objective, to protect a little girl. But when she is kidnapped, Creasy unleashes hell against those who have wronged him, in hopes of making a right.The film is definitely one of Denzel's best in my opinion, he truly shines as the man with nothing to lose, as he tortures and shoots his way through the endless bad guys, were everyone is corrupt. More importantly Dakota Fanning, is simple a joy to watch on-screen, she helps heal a broken man with her endless banter and when she is taken, we; the audience feel Creasy's anger and everything he does is justified.Simply fantastic.",10,1,2,29 November 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Funny then expected
","Ron Burgundy is one of the greatest Anchor men alive...Until a woman comes along to take his place.....This movie is just plain funny and will have you in stitches laughing out loud the movie has numerous cameos from some of the best comedic talent in Hollywood. Will Ferell does a tremendous job in playing the stupid chauvinistic pig who feels threatened by a woman...only to realise she's clever and wonderful...there for falling in love.Every scene is a delight when fellow actors Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell add to the mix of mayhem; I especially laughed out loud during the Anchorman war.....Hilarious....",8,1,1,14 November 2008
American Gangster," 'My Man!'
","American Gangster is based on Frank Lucas, a real Harlem drug lord;the film starts off with a brutal killing of a man who is burnt and shot to death. Then Frank's boss Bumpy and father figure dies from a heart attack and chaos ensues as all rival gangsters want in on Bumpy's old territory. Frank however has a strong dislike for flashy gangsters and decides to take over and then realises something. Instead of buying drugs from a intermediary, he goes straight to the manufacturer and begins a partnership by importing heroin in dead US soldiers coffins.Richie Roberts is a upcoming Jersey cop who decides to find the man responsible for selling 'Blue Magic' and finds out that more then half of the city's cops are on the take, and so he sets out to bring down Frank Lucas.The film is very stylish and gives the Frank character depth, he isn't like Tony Montana who wants to get power quick and live the life of a millionaire, but preserve his power and reign. Denzel is pitch perfect as always giving the character a sense of belonging while Russell Crowe plays Richie with great comic timing. The best scene is when Frank and Richie meet, the scene sends goosebumps down ones back when they sit and talk. An iconic moment in cinema.But the most touching and sad scene of all is when Frank is released from prison and see the world that is 1990's, a completely different world from the one he left. The way Denzel holds the cappuccino cup is almost endearing but mostly it is the friendship that is created between cop and robber that sticks in the audiences mind.This film is done with pure brilliance and is a perfect true gangster epic, even though the story has been done before...Blow, Scarface.Still a great film.",7,0,2,13 March 2008
Hancock," Will Smith is the modern Superman
","Hancock is a modern day superman, he is able to soar through the skies faster then any plane, he is invulnerable to any pain; he is stronger then a million men. Yet his world is full of loneliness and like mere mortals he turns to the drink for love... An alcoholic superhero with a foul mouth and disregard for public safety he descends upon the criminals, mutilating some, breaking others...Literally.Until he meets PR man Ray who vows to change his life and make him a 'real' superhero but in turn Hancock finds himself falling in love with Mary, Ray's wife....And then Hancock finds out he's not alone...at all....Will Smith takes on a new role and like 'I am Legend', shows his acting talents; he is a true Hollywood marvel....Many critics have dubbed Mr. Smith a Hollywood movie star...I disagree....Yes, Mr. Smith is a movie star and very fine one, but he is a true actor....I found the special effects very enticing and brought the world of the superhero to life....I loved Hancock's world....the last of his kind....The script was very good, but I thought the build up to the world needing Hnacock could have been much better....More dramatic and Hnacock's emotions... And the end could have had a true baddie....But still a great film the end fight scene and closure is perfect and hope to see a sequel..Or just leave it here...Either way works...",9,2,4,4 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," One of the worst movies I have ever seen
","I know that this is the greatest origin story for a movie villain, the man we know as Darth Vader. But George Lucas got a little carried away thinking that this an epic scale film..Yes it is...Buts its still lame...boring and dull...The origin story should have been more exciting much more darker and the occasional comedy makes it worse..I felt that Phantom Menace was amazing...beautifully shot and a great dark villain...Darth Maul. But this film lacked that menace...You had Christopher Lee who was not scary...Samuel L. Jackson...I'm sorry to say was bad in this movie...He just stood there...No emotion....The special effects were nice but thats it...The ending however will bring back the little dignity this franchise has left...Darth Vaders awakening..",1,6,12,27 November 2008

","Bob Lee Swagger is ex-military; he is one of the best marksmen that ever stood on a battle field. But after him and his partner are abandoned and ultimately his partner being killed, Bob decides to leave the military.He is approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson; and offered a chance to fight for his country by finding a assassin, only to be double crossed; which leads to like he says in the movie.'There's going to be more shooting, more people are going to die' And thats what happens.I have been a big admirer of Mark since watching Three Kings, loved him in Four brothers but I gave this a miss simply because of the plot; too ummm...Bourne....But I found my self buying this DVD and watching it.This film has some great shooting scenes, the big climax is a let down but overall the action is continuous and exciting.",8,1,5,7 December 2007
Inception," Ridiculous and extravagant, with little sense
","Cobb is a extractor, he enters the minds of powerful people and takes their ideas. Only his latest case is not as simple, instead of taking an idea, he must implant one; however Cobb is a man whose own sub-conscience is in disarray as his dead wife threatens to destroy him.I thought originally when I watched the trailer...'Interesting...But I've seen this somewhere before?'And then as I watched the film it hit me..'Paprika!', Paprika is a anime were a therapist enters the minds of patients to distinguish the problem.I am not saying that the film is a complete copy, because its not...However, the complexity of the film is quite confusing at times, even for a life long sci-fi fan; I guess that was the allure when you consider the many, many positive and glowing reviews. I enjoyed some of the action sequences, but it did not really keep me on the edge of my seat. Cillian Murphy and Ken Wattanbe, were the true stars in my opinion, they played their roles very well, while Leonardo DiCaprio was one dimensional, even though he was supposed to be the most complex and intriguing character in the film.",4,51,97,11 February 2011
Sherlock Holmes," A Reinvention of an Icon
","Sherlock Holmes finds himself facing one of his most difficult cases yet. Holmes manages to stop, Lord Blackwood, a serial killer and bring him to justice, but rumours of him using black magic plague the streets of London.So, when Blackwood is hanged...all seems to end well....However Blackwood returns from the grave bringing with him vengeance and the darkest of witchcraft. Holmes must deduce as to how Blackwood is able to kill people without laying a finger on them....And deal with the possibility of losing his dear Watson to a woman named Mary.I remember back in year eight reading a Sherlock Holmes story, simply because it was a book our teacher had chosen..I felt no passion, simply because I was forced to listen...Now, years later...I love books, but still haven't got around to reading Sherlock Holmes...But I jumped at the chance to watch this movie.I had reservations of Robert Downey, but he blew me away with his performance as Tony Stark...But I honestly felt this was not a role for him..I was proved wrong...He is witty, charming, funny and above all...exudes intelligence as he explains things to the audience...The big surprise was 'Jude Law', he was strong and great side kick, who was just as witty and funny as Sherlock. The performance by Mark Strong does not go unnoticed, he revels in the role of the despicable Lord, bent on destruction...While Rachel Mcadams and Kelly Reilly give a radiance and beauty.The action scenes were just superb and the choreography was spot on, making one believe that thats how they fought during the old days.But the greatest thing about this movie is that, it throws away the 'Clean Cut' Holmes, and implements a bit of craziness into the mix, making the clever chap, one who can fall into great bouts of depression and participate in boxing matches the next... But more importantly, it flat out hilarious.A reinvention of a icon.",Null,2,2,26 June 2010

","WALLE is a robot who cleans up garbage in a world deserted by humans who have left to find a better world...So Walle cleans up day after day....Until one day, a robot arrives sent by the humans to find out if there is life on earth...WALLE falls in love with this robot named 'Eve'....As Eve finishes her job...she leaves...only to have WALLE following...The overall the story is a little mushy for a children's film but it is the brilliance of the special effects designers that make this film stand out above the rest.The character of WALLE is very sweet and adorable...he is the robot version of Hugh Grant...The amazing thing is WALLE doesn't speak...he communicates through buzzing and beeps...But the direction is done so well that the audience understands everything the little robot says....",10,0,1,14 February 2009
The Good Shepherd," 'We make sure the wars are small ones.'
","Edward Wilson is chosen to join a new Government agency known as the CIA, to look after all of America's interests by gathering intelligence and implementing it successfully through secret covert operations. But as Wilson delves deeper into this world of lies and secrets he finds himself swollen whole, as he must choose between his family and his country.Matt Damon is a fantastic actor who portrays the silent Edward brilliantly giving him an almost sinister quality, a person that you can't be too sure about...All the other actors were quite good in their chosen roles, but I found myself focusing mainly on Edwards, his silence is haunting to say the least...I guess when you have as many secrets as Edward, it's best to not say a word unless it is necessary. Angelina Jolie is beautiful as ever, but I found her character to be quite annoying.More importantly I really did feel heartbroken for Edward when he had to leave Laura behind for Clover, but the scene when Laura and Edward are reunited is beautiful. We, saw a happy Edward; after such a long time. But let's not forget the CIA as it plays the biggest role in the film, making decisions in the shadows, decisions that will affect the lives of millions..It's also a pleasure to see Joe Pesci make an appearance.Absolutely brilliant, the only reason I give this an 8 out of 10 is because I thought it was a little long, however a film like this require time and patient; after all that is how a masterpiece is made.",10,1,2,18 January 2010
The Terminal," Citizen of nowhere
","I was sitting down on a Sunday afternoon and caught this film, and I was pleasantly surprised, it cheered a dull Sunday up in an instant.Victor is a man, who has become a citizen of nowhere; simply because his country is in civil unrest. Instead, he must wait at the JFK terminal until his country restores order.The film is genuinely funny and feel-good, there are moments as well were I really felt bad for Victor, stranded in a country were he had no idea of it's customs...You genuinely get behind Victor when he tries to put together two people, and making the best use of the Terminal. The other thing about the film which is quite amazing, are the different characters, the very funny Gupta, the beautiful Dollores, the lovable Enrique and the vile Frank Dixon, the man you love to hate.The one aspect I thought the film needed work on was the character, Amelia...She was whiny and annoying, the end was a little off for a Spielberg movie, which kind of ruined it, but still a wonderful movie to pass the time.",9,0,1,28 January 2010

","Michael Oher is a kind gentle young boy who has no home, no family. He eats left overs, has only one pair of clothes and sleeps in a laundromat. Until one day, Leigh Anne Tuohy takes the boy in, changing not only his life, but hers.I do not know exactly as to how much of this is based on fact, and I have no knowledge of 'American Football' simply because I am a Brit, but I found this movie to be quite inspirational and moving. It is the tale of race and how it does not matter what colour you are, what religion you follow....Simply that we are all human beings...The cast is not the best at giving a great performance, but Sandra Bullock carries the cast through. An average feel good movie.",5,1,1,9 May 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," The grim reality of prison life
","Andy is a innocent man, who is thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit, he finds himself having to survive and in turn begins a life long friendship with another inmate.This film is raw and intense, it doesn't hide the brutal honesty of prison life. I found myself at times cringing at certain scenes that are very hard to watch.Through this film I felt Andy's pain, his sadness, his fear and his rage; his yearning to be a free man once again and then his happiness as he breaks away from the clutches of that evil place.The acting is top-notch, all the actors give great performances, especially Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose narration gives the audience something to hold onto. I found it quite sad, when Red is released; a man who has spent his whole life behind bars and is unable to find any kind of belonging...until he finally decides to go after his old friend.But for me, it is when Andy chisels away night after night and crawls his way to freedom that brought tears to my eyes....As he screams out, while the rain falls on him. It's one the greatest moments in cinema, I began to breath once again; something I was unable to do throughout the film. Simply mesmerising.",10,0,0,10 November 2009
Blow," 'I crossed an imaginary line with a bunch of plants'
","Johnny Depp proves once again he can play a role which involves depth and understanding.By that I mean, he becomes the character in every sense.I as the audience believed George when he speaks about his own philosophy on drugs and how the government wants to keep him down.If you are looking for a gangster story that has shoot outs and great one liners. Then avoid this movie.Blow focuses on the life of a real drug dealer, his philosophy and his way of life, the trial and tribulations he faces and how someone can become a overnight drug kingpin and lose it, just as fast as they have achieved it.Depp does justice for a realistic and gritty role.",8,0,1,28 February 2008
Iron Man," I am Ironnnn-Mann!
","I've grown up watching the 90's Marvel cartoons, my favourite were of course, X-MEN, Spiderman and Ironman. When I first heard of this character being turned into a live action movie I had huge expectations and then saw the trailer. I was captured.The track Ironman by Black Sabbath is perfect, especially the 'I am Ironnnn-Mann!'; at first I thought that this would be like Batman Begins the characters are roughly the same, not the exact same....but both millionaires and create their own suits. The plot is based on the comics, Tony is a weapons manufacturer who is captured in Afganistan (Contemporised); by terrorist who want him to build a weapon and instead he uses this time to create the Mark 1. After escaping Tony has a epiphany and has a change of heart, stopping his company from making weapons; this causes tensions with partner Stane, who plots to bring Tony down by creating a suit known as the Iron Monger, although his name is never mentioned.I never expected Iron-Man to be a comedy and thats what caught me off guard. Comedy suits Iron Man...and so does Robert Downey Jr, Downey is Tony Stark, he gives off a brilliant performance as a fun loving bachelor and brings the hidden depths of the character to light when he realises his wrongs. Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet as Pepper Potts, while Jeff Bridges plays the conniving Stane; Rhodey is played by Terrence Howard who plays the concerning friend and ally of Stark with prominence and I have high hopes of seeing him as War Machine. Its great to see well established actors taking on these roles and making it more interesting and full of depth...The Iron Man suit is spectacular to look at and the second fight scene is satisfactory while the end fight scene with Iron Monger could have been a little better, but this is a origin story and succeeds in telling the origin of Iron Man, the S.H.E.I.L.D touch was perfect at the end.A childhood hero has been given justice...",10,2,4,2 July 2008
Casino Royale," Will leave you shaken and stirred....
","This film takes everything that has existed before and throws it out the window, starting an age for a new series of films which are much more darker and grim, portraying Bond as a killer; an assassin. Nothing more.Bond has been given his 00 status and has been assigned his first mission to track down a money launderer and in this whirlwind he finds love, betrayal and rage. Daniel Craig delivers an amazing performance as Bond, a new Bond; no more clichés and one-liners; he is brutal and swift. The film has some amazing fight sequences and stunts especially the 'free-running', beautifully shot and executed and will have the audience staring up in disbelief, it was a little odd seeing Dame Judi Dench as Q....A whole new cast would have been much better...But you can't complain when a film this fine is created...Daniel Craig has definitely shushed all his critics and haters....A lot of Bond lovers have still criticised this movie and said it isn't anything like the previous movies, if you think about it, all spy movies nowadays have the Bond gadgets and one-liners, its time for something new.This is a redefinition of what Bond, really is....",8,0,2,1 November 2008
Toy Story 3," A Great Goodbye To A Great Trilogy
","Woody and the Gang are mistakenly sent to a daycare during Andy's clean up as he prepares to go off to college. Woody is only one determined to find Andy, while the other toys decide to stay in the daycare. I've tried to round up the story in a sentence, but honestly there is so much to this storyline that it is impossible to write everything.I grew up with the Toy Story films, so when I first heard about the third and final film (Hopefully Not) I took a deep breath and entered the cinema. What happened next was a breathtaking journey of a toy's love for his 'kid'. The film does not disappoint at all, it is funny with wonderful witty dialogue and scenes, as well as fantastic voice acting from some truly talented set of actors.Every scene is brilliantly devised and there is never a dull moment, whether Woody and the gang have a falling out, or Woody is imprisoned in the little girls house, or Buzz's Spanish turn. It's just utterly magical. One of the true highlights of the movie is 'Ken & Barbie', you have to see it to understand just how funny Michael Keaton is!I'll always remember the last scene, not because of Woody but because of what it can do....I will always remember the weeping of a woman next to me, I will remember the reddening eyes of a grown man on a row in front of me. For you see this is not just a simple 'cartoon or animation' it is a tale of growing up, a tale of leaving innocent things behind that made rainy afternoons fun, its about the splendours of the imagination.I hope this is not the end my friends. But if it is. Thank you for the memories and farewell.",10,0,0,23 February 2011
Signs," A message. A warning. A sign...of things to come. M.Night Shyamalan
","Graham is a widower who lives with his two children and brother on a farm when crop signs appear in his field he assumes children but it is soon revealed that the whole world is experiencing this phenomenon....The film was hated by many for unknown facts, this film in my opinion is very good it keeps the suspense and thrills running throughout the movie; Mel Gibson is brilliant in this flick as a man confused by the loss of his lover and mother to his children. Joaqiun...this was the first time I watched this man on the film; he is brilliant simply put and his acting only gets better. M Night is a brilliant director who keeps the audience guessing and your brain is almost working overtime....the alien was a little annoying...towards the end....But all in all a good solid movie...well acted and directed.",9,1,7,23 August 2008
Beowulf," Beowulf!
","Beowulf arrives to rid the land of a demon named Grendal, however after slaying the creature he provokes its Mother, who offers Beowulf a deal. Growing up I was aware of the Beowulf tale and saw a couple versions of it, so when this movie came along; I ignored it...I mean what could Hollywood possibly apply to such a epic tale...Turns out they can give the tale a bit of sexiness in the form of Angelina Jolie and give Ray Winstone a six pack.Visually Beowulf is amazing, although the storyline is loosely based on the original it does not take anything away as what you receive in return is a tale of 'temptation'. The animation is just brilliant and I truly believe that comic book movies could benefit from this, than live action movies..The action scenes are a little off and not enough, perhaps due to the complexity of animation and the film does slow down half way yet it remains entertaining, the actors are all chosen brilliantly, Ray Winstone roars every line with menace, while Anthony Hopkins gives a good performance, but then we have the beautiful Angelina Jolie who looks stunning as ever as Grendal's Mother.",8,1,1,14 May 2011
Speed," 'There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do?'
","Jack is an adrenaline fuelled LAPD cop who stops terrorist, Howard Payne from getting 3 million dollars. Now Howard Payne has set up a 'game' for Jack.There's a bomb on a bus, when the bus goes 50mph its armed, if it drops below 50mph, it blows up.This is an all out adrenaline rush from start to finish; Keanu Reeves sounds at certain times odd, his acting comes under scrutiny but he keeps the audience locked by committing daredevil stunts, jumping onto a moving bus, sling underneath it to disarm a bomb.Sandra Bullock is funny and sweet as the woman behind the wheel and there is chemistry between the two which works. The action is mostly on the bus, the obstacles the vehicle must overcome; the 'gap' scene is a little ...... mainly because you see the bus leap across the gap likes it alive....But still a great action movie.",10,1,2,1 November 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Yippie Kah Yay....
","I haven't been much of a fan of the trilogy mainly because I was too young But I know enough about Die hard to slide into this film; knowing the background of John MacClane.The film is packed with fights and bullets and mostly things getting burnt or blown up.John McClane is a police officer going through the hardships of being a single parent; one night he is given a job to pick up a teenager and take him to the FBI. Only thing is this teenager,Matthew Farrell(Justin Long) is one of the best computer hackers in America.As John meets Matthew; cyber terrorist attack and so action pursues the two were ever they go.The film was great with one liners and Bruce does rock in this Die hard in my view; the trailer however looked a bit like MI3 maybe because of Maggie Q I'm not too sure.But all in all a great action movie.",8,0,3,5 December 2007
X2: X-Men United," 'You picked the wrong house, Bub!'
","I've decided to re-comment on this movie as I for some reason unknown to me, decided to sit down and watch it all over again.This surpasses the first film and explores other characters; Bryan Singer does his best to stay close to the comics but there are big errors....Yet this movie still thrills a hardcore fan....Just about...This film carries on after the first, Magneto is in his plastic prison and is regularly visited by General Stryker who has a way to make mutants co-operate...Brainwashing them with a serum. Rogue is now dating Bobby the Iceman while Jean is having troubles with her power and Cyclops feels unloved. And Wolverine returns from his 'soul-searching' adventure to find out a mutant has attacked the President. With the Jean, Storm, Cyclops and Charles Xavier away and Wolverine babysitting the mansion is attacked by the US Government.Now Wolverine is thrown in a 'unwanted' role as a leader and protector, he slices and dices through the intruders and rescues a few....And now its time to face the past and make a new future...I loved Wolverines berserker rage as he unleashes hell on the soldiers that decide to walk into his house and threaten his 'family'...I loved Hugh Jackman's fight scenes at second glance. On second glance I found many things endearing, like Jean and Cyclops deteriorating relationship, Nightcrawler's scenes especially his own self-introduction, the bonding scenes with Storm and Nightcrawler; but something I found very sad was the use of Cyclops, loved his fight scene but then he gets cut out, he should have been given a more pivotal role and Lady Deathstrike should been a main villain.All in all a nice comic book movie.",10,2,4,5 February 2008
The Matrix," A revolutionary sci-fi and action movie
","Neo is a computer hacker who spends his nights wondering what is real and soon he meets a Morpheus who shows him that the world is nothing but a computer programme designed to keep people alive and power the machine world.....The plot is very complicated but if you're a comic book geek like me then the plot is very simple....But this film not only provides a great complex story but the action is unseen, by that I mean that the action sequences are amazing, stunning and mind boggling. The special effects take this film to a level of its own and have become almost a cliché in some action films, the 'bullet time'; the synchronised fight scenes....Keanu Reeves who has been panned by critics for years, finally silences them by providing the greatest performance in his career as the confused chosen one; Lawrence Fishburne who is endearing as the man who has searched his whole life for Neo while Moss is the love interest and Hugo Weaving as the baddie, a baddie like no other; he redefines scary with his cold, steel like tone of voice.",10,0,0,1 November 2008

The film has some great choreography with great music and a brilliantly funny cats. Jennifer Lopez appears to be very shy and insecure in this film. While Richard is equally shy and insecure as John Clark; its very nice to see Susan Sarandon play Gere's wife, the just fit...The film is hilarious and will have you laugh out loud and smile... I found the scene when Link is being teased by his colleagues for his love of dance...actually teased isn't the right word..Abused for his love of music very sad, but for once John Clark decides to stand up and he does...very heartwarming...",9,0,2,28 June 2008
Heat," Deniro and Pacino shine opposite each other
","Deniro is a professional armed robber who has planned a job on a bank but his previous job which resulted in the death of officers by a unreliable member has led...Pacino on his tail....one he can't get rid of.The film shows the lives of both men brilliantly...Deniro's lonely existence and Pacino's hectic life. The film speeds up as it goes along and is an adrenaline rush when both men realise the other one...The best scene is probably the café scene when both sit and talk; I thought this was a brilliant performance by Deniro second to his great Vito Corleone... Pacino here uses his voice more often, shouting the catchphrase. The bank heist and the eventual shootout is brilliant; Michale Mann and will always be one of the best shootouts second to his Collateral shootout scene.",7,0,1,20 September 2008
300," Blood, guts and muscle...
","King Leonidas vows to take on the Persian Army even with his own advisor's plotting against him and so he wages war against Xerxes, the god king.This film has some amazing graphics and the fighting is beautifully shot, the audience can see the destruction that a blade can cause, the slow down of blood spilling. This is a pure male dominated type of movie that is about rage and aggression...the story is based on truth and how 300 men took on an entire nation; the Spartan armies defence and offence in the first fight was brilliantly done.The graphics are amazing and it really brings in the comic feel and glorifies the violence that is done to the enemy.",8,1,1,5 October 2008

","Olive decides that she's tired of being a 'Virgin' and makes up lies that she has lost her virginity to a boy...But then she makes the mistake of saying that she has slept with a fellow friend to help him from being bullied in school...and soon it seems that all the boys in school want her to do the same.I thought the plot was quite intriguing from what I saw in the trailer, I thought that Olive was making up stories in order to get A's, but it was not..Instead what I got was a lame comedy that does not know what it wants to be. At first I thought Olive was quite clever, but she doesn't seem to understand the repercussions of her actions. People try to pass this off as intelligent...but I didn't see any of that.There are a few meagre laughs but its not for me...And I felt that Christians were portrayed badly...I am not a Christian but why does Hollywood have to portray any group of people continuously through stereotypes?",1,41,75,10 June 2011
Fantastic Four," 'Its Clobberin' Time!'
","The first time I watched this film I was a little harsh, mainly because I missed bits; but watching this film again, I was surprised.The film may not have the best plot...but its great fun just watching the characters finding their powers.Four astronauts are exposed to space radiation and develop super human powers.Jessica Alba is right for the role of Sue Storm; Mr. Fantatsic is spot on, while Johnny Storm and The Thing are perfect.Dr.Doom is a little dodgy but Julian adds sizzle to the role.The fight at the end is a little disappointing but its all good, we get to see Dr. Doom.",7,0,0,24 January 2008
Gangs of New York," Should have won the Oscar here...
","Many dub Martin Scorsese is considered a great Director but I've never really seen the magic or creative side of him; after watching Departed I was angered at how messy and rushed Departed was, and then I watched Gangs of New York. Gangs of New York is very stylish and lavish; it tells the tale of New York back in 1863; Amsterdam arrives to the Five Points to avenge the death of his father.Daniel Day Lewis shines as Bill the Butcher; he brings in the sheer menace and nastiness that lies within the character, while Dicaprio pulls off the vengeful son role with enough grit, Cameron Diaz is also surprisingly captivating; the rest of the cast provide a satisfactory performance.The setting of New York is bright and colourful and shines with colours which can blind the audience with their radiance, and then you see the more disturbing images the barbarians that live within the houses and buildings...The Only Martin Scorsese Film worth watching...",8,0,0,9 October 2008

","I've heard everyone around me say that this is the 'true' story as to how Facebook came to be...the truth is we will never know..But this presents a picture of how the pursuit for wealth can destroy us.Mark Zuckerberg sits at his desk one night after being dumped by his girlfriend, out of anger he begins to furiously type away at his computer that talks about his girlfriend and then publishes it online through his blog....Then, he has an idea..He compiles a database of the girls at Harvard by hacking into the school system and acquiring their photos, his act of anger proves to be very popular among his fellow male students....and thus he meets three senior students who want to design a site were friends can create a page and meet other friends....Mark agrees only to delay their so-called project and begins work on 'FACEBOOK'...when he unleashes the social network, his troubles seem to have only just begun.I thought that for a fictional representation of what could be, it was quite compelling. Jesse Eisenberg does a marvellous job as his greed for power overshadows everything including his only friend played by the future Spiderman 'Andrew Garfield'. Their is a sadness to Eisenberg's portrayal as he yearns for someone who is gone forever. While Garfield outshines any other actor in the film because of what happens to him at the end...it's a heartbreaking scene when he realises of the great deception; wonderfully done by Garfield. While Justin Timberlake is surprisingly quite irritating as the Napster creator, Sean Parker. I loved the ending, it does not provide any closure; but we get to see that even Zuckerberg refreshes his FB page continuously!",10,1,2,4 June 2011
Goodfellas," A little overrated but still a great gangster movie
","Based on real life it tells the tale of Henry Hill, who grows up to be a gangster, a soldier in the Italian Mafia. The film gives information on how the Mafia operates and the members, Martin Scorsese reveals the main players by giving them a back-story and showing how they came to be.The film is very funny at times; yet it shows just how quick a gangsters life can be; there is no trust and shows how gangsters live there lives, paranoid. As you watch the film you begin to like the main three, Ray, Deniro and Pesci but when push comes to shove, friends can become enemies in an instant. Overall the performances were each perfect and brilliant directing by Scorsese who should have won his Oscar on this movie.",7,0,2,1 July 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," 'Right, next to you'
","The Bourne Supremacy is a sequel to Bourne Identity.Jason Bourne is again on the run only this time he's the predator.This film is like the first full of thrills and great scenes with good realistic car chase scenes; the martial arts get a little better and the scene were he beats the man up with a rolled up newspaper is hilarious.Matt Damon shines in this role, he portrays the character very well. At times you will find yourself chuckling because of how Bourne plays his enemies.The film has some genuine scenes were the audience feels anger for what has been done to the character and at times sad; a great film which indicates Damon might be the new action hero of our time, like Stallone, Willis and Arnie were in the 80's and 90's.A great film which at time will leave you smiling.",9,3,4,23 February 2008
Valkyrie," The rise of the Valkyrie's
","Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is a German soldier in world war 2, yet he does not agree with Adolf Hitler's policies and feels sickened by the thought that his country is being destroyed by such a fiend and so he unites with others to assassinate Hitler.I envisioned this movie to be thrilling and a film of epic proportions when considering the line up, Tom Cruise, Bill Nighly and Tom Wilkinson to name a few, but throughout the film I felt that Cruise gave a less than convincing performance, maybe the character of Stauffenberg was not as riveting as others and it was perhaps more to do with killing Hitler. The ending was quite sad with Bill Nighly and Cruise giving the best performances in the entire performance as they wait for the end.",5,0,1,4 July 2011
The Simpsons Movie," Finally the greatest family on TV arrive on the big screen
","Springfield has contaminated its resources and to prevent it from spreading the American government place it in a big bubble, hoping the problem will go away and when it does not....They plan to blow it up....Can the Simpsons save their beloved town.I had second thoughts about this movie....I remember being in the cinema and then at the last minute changed my mind....I have been an admirer of the television show since I was a child and loved every moment, laughed at every turn....So when I watched this movie I was surprised and laughed out loud, the animation has been adapted for the big screen and everything seems more 'Shrek' like.... Homer's one-liners are simply hilarious and I liked how they re-explored Bart and Homers relationship....Maggie's ruthless skills as a killer when faced by a chimp.....Loved that moment!The pig was a great accessory to an already well known family and made it more funny....",9,1,2,7 December 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," Would have been more interesting if the movie was about Clyde Shelton!
","On an ordinary night, a brutal crime takes place upon an innocent family, Clyde Shelton watches helplessly as two criminals take the lives of his wife and child. But during the trial, one of the killers is let go, due to his testimony....Shelton, a broken man cannot understand as to why Nick, the prosecutor has accepted a deal?I was quite interested by the trailer, but what I got was fair different...I thought Gerard Butler did a tremendous job as the broken man, I nearly cried as he pleaded to Nick for help, not to let the killer go free, and felt his blood-lust when he gave the criminals their own medicine...I thought Jamie Fox slowed this movie down, he just didn't cut it as the no nonsense prosecutor, I loved the man in Collateral and Miami Vice, but here...He just couldn't step up to the mark. I personally felt that it would have been an entirely different animal if they concentrated solely on Clyde...The ending was terrible...no closure whatsoever....It wasn't all bad...I laughed at times, and was genuinely fascinated by how Clyde was able to do what he was doing....But the ending ruined what potentially could have been a good movie.",6,0,0,18 January 2010
V for Vendetta," V for Very Very Good...
","This is another take on a graphic novel and brings the comic to life.Hugo Weaving plays the mysterious V, who has survived a government experiment and fights the 'Totalitarian' state.Natalie Portman's accent is fake. its very easy to tell, for a British person but she plays her part nonetheless with perfection.The film has some great fight scenes and the view of London is beautifully stunning.But it is the V character alone that is great, he is mysterious and weird, the mask is that of Guy Fawkes, a British legend who tried to blow the royal family, but his plans were foiled and he in return was burnt alive.Hugo Weaving recites the lines of Shakespeare with great admiration and love, its beautifully spoken.A very good adaptation of the comic.",9,3,9,16 May 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not the most funniest Will Ferrell movie
","Ricky Bobby is a racer who is pretty stupid, the only thing he can do is go faster on the race track. Until he has a crash and then things fall to pieces his wife leaves him for his best friend, and he loses his race car sponsor ships.....The film has some genuinely funny scenes and some scenes when you just think to yourself 'this isn't funny'.The scene with the cougar was hilarious and it shows that there is justice in the world when Ricky's mother sorts his two sons out once and for all, just disappointed that this isn't as good as Anchor man....",6,0,0,14 November 2008
The Godfather," An Offer You Cant Refuse
","The Godfather has influenced every gangster film that has been made since. In terms of mannerisms, quotes, story line and characters.Vito Corleone is also known as Don Corleone, who is the head of the Corleone Crime family, who are one of the five crime families in the Italian Mafia that rule America. Don Corleone meets a drug dealer named Sollazzo who wants to make a deal involving narcotics, the Don who has old fashioned value see's this as a threat and rejects the offer only to be gunned down. The Corleone kids, Sonny, Tom, Michael and Fredo must unite to hold their family and organisation together. And for Michael the youngest, things will never be the same again.The Godfather is a masterpiece. There are endless scenes in the movie that strike a strong and powerful cord with the audience. From the first scene which shows Don Corleone sort out a problem to the violent death of his son and the rise of Michael.Although made in 1972, still connects with people today. Its a different type of family movie like someone previously reviewed. It holds a strong sense of loyalty and what one will do if they are pushed beyond their limits. The cast is perfect; Marlon Brando is amazing as the ageing Don, while James Caan plays the hot headed Sonny perfectly and Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall give a great performance. But it is Al Pacino who shines. He portrays the innocent young man who vows to never be like his family only to plunge himself into darkness in order to protect his beloved family.A masterpiece. A masterpiece that has effected the world when it comes to gangster movies.",10,3,6,19 September 2006
