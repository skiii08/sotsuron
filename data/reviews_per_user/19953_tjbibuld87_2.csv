Changeling," Best Clint Eastwood film to date
","'Changeling' is a film encompassing multiple plot elements: L.A. police corruption during the '20s, gender politics of the '20s, and power-hungry public figures. However all of these elements branch from the spine of this plot in which a single mother, (Christine Collins played by Angelina Jolie) comes home one day to find that her young son Walter, has disappeared. After some investigation the police return a young boy to her custody whom they claim to be her son. Collins however, believes this boy to be an impostor, and on her search to find the son she feels she's lost, she finds herself up against a web of corruption, and the gauntlet of a very public crusade against it.The plot devices of the injustices of police corruption, and a society that believes women to be fragile of body, mind and character; are compelling and empowering to say the least. The bleakness of Eastwood's tone (the cooler color schemes, the sparse soundtrack, and the seemingly endless roster of selfishly driven archetypical characters) make Christine's struggle appear to be an impossible one. However if you are a parent or have parental instincts you feel emotionally obligated to go on this journey with her.The characters are interestingly portrayed. The bad guys are REALLY bad, and the sympathetic characters are all afflicted in some way; Hardly the hopeful message this film drives towards. The film continues to get even more morbid than expected when it delves into a sensitive subject that has been navigated by Eastwood with both tact, and brutal honesty; and that subject is that of child predators. Much of the violence against children is psychological as opposed to graphic, but it is disturbing to sit through nonetheless. However this plot element is so effective due to brilliant casting. Jason Butler Harner, who plays Gordon Northcott (a child killer who might've killed Collins' son) was particularly good in his role; not just for his portrayal of Northcott's tortured motivations, but for his cowardice, (because let's face it; the only killers capable of preying on the most innocent and defenseless members of society are cowards.) Also quite notable was the child actor Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark: Northcott's young accomplice.And yet as you continue on this dark, disturbing journey with Christine Collins, although the triumphs are few and far between, you understand her unwavering vigilance. You come to understand that although she may never find her son, the small victories she did accomplish wouldn't have happened without her undying sense of hope in the face of despair. I recommend seeing 'Changeling' for the dramatic portrayal of a true story of hope. However, be prepared to have your heart broken a few times along the way.",9,6,10,24 December 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Not just one of the best films of the year...One of the best films of all time
","I'm not going to talk about the originality of a gritty subject matter, or a love story, or a coming of age story. The late, great Joseph Campbell once said that we have only a finite pool of human stories to tell, and we continue to retell them throughout the ages. What makes a story truly unique is its telling through the eyes and experiences of particular generations. What I am going to talk about is this particular version of a love story, a slum story, a coming of age story, a story of fate, and a story of perseverance.Jamal Malik: the films hero, is the Indian Oliver Twist: A boy from such tragic and unfortunate circumstances, and yet at the same time so persevering, so pure of heart, you can't help but root for him. His love for an idealized fallen woman, is so chivalrously unwavering, that you cannot help but be overcome with such intense longing for its bittersweet culmination. The characters are so well developed, that the strong performances seem like hooks that immerse the audience deeper into the multi-sensory experience of this film.The genius of this film however, is in the method of its telling. It is an old story retold through the eyes of Jamal Malik and his experiences. The film's most creative points are in its narrative: its use of flashbacks, its editing, the seamless use of montage to mark the passage of time, its use of color and sound, and its ability to use all of these elements to create a dynamic film experience.I will also tell you precisely why this film will go down in history as one of the best ever made. It is an emotionally arresting modern fairy tale, that will obliterate every cynical cell in your body. (believe me I have MORE than my fair share of cynicism.) I find that this film takes you on a journey through tragedy and depravity, and shows you the only solution to enduring the barren landscape of this world. And that solution is through believing firmly in the human connections we make with one another. That despite the tragedies we endure, if we believe in love and those we love whole-heartedly, we can overcome anything. This is a film that shines a light on the parts of our soul that are called upon in hard times; a unifying factor that pervades us all. And THAT my friends, is what makes a GREAT film.Forget film to be what it often is: a tool to convey reality, to convince you of a story's believability. Instead remember that film is merely a medium through which truly beautiful art can be created. 'Slumdog Millionaire' made a hopeless romantic out of me, and anyone who sees this film will not be able to help themselves but follow suit with me, and the throngs of fans who flock to see this film over and over again.",10,14,28,14 December 2008
