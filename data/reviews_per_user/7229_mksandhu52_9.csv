Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good Film!
","Episode I is a good movie. A good start to the prequels.When TPM came out in 1999, i went to watch it about 3 times and i love it! I just love all the characters in TPM. Padme Amidala is one of my top favourite than comes the young Obi-Wan Kenobi played by actor Ewan McGregor. Actress Natalie Portman plays her part very well.Jar Jar Binks is so cute! Very funny. His eyes are lol. It is great to see a funny character in the Star Wars movies. Okay, the actor who plays the Young Anakin Skywalker was super. That kid really does know how to act!The CG work is great and the costumes are out-of-the-world.A great film and a great start to the prequels.",8,14,24,10 November 2010

127 Hours," A Very Good Movie!
","This movie is just amazing... from watching the trailers and promos i knew that this movie will be amazing and it was... super-amazing! First of all, this movie is base on a true story.Danny Boyle is an amazing film-maker, first giving us the blockbuster Slumdog Millionaire and now this super-doper movie! He really knows how to make a good film and with a great story line.James Franco the star of the movie really did a super-job. He took on his character very well and his acting was very, very, very good. 127 Hours is one of his best movies.Everything else, soundtrack was great. The editing was done great...A have to see movie.My review: 9/10",9,0,2,8 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Very Good film!
","Attack of the Clones is my 2nd favourite Star Wars movie after Revenge of the Sith!The action (Clone Wars) was powerful and even the romance was super! Both Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman played their characters Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala very, very well. I really love the Meadow Picnic scene and the Wedding scene. Very well filmed. Overall, Episode II is great and the movie does have a lot of important parts e.g. Tatooine Homestead and the relationship between Owen Lars and Anakin Skywalker, the Bounty Hunters such as Boba Fett and where he comes from...I really like the battle between Master Yoda and Count Dooku! WOW!",9,3,5,10 November 2010
No Strings Attached," A Good Movie! Natalie Portman was GREAT!
","OK... i was NOT expecting much from this movie but i was really WOW at the end!!!Yes, the movie was alright for some but I LOVED IT!!! As a Natalie Portman FAN, i was really worried about her doing a full-on Comedy role... from her past films like Leon and the Star Wars movies (Her role: Padme Amidala has a SAD ending...) Closer, V for Vendetta, Brothers... her roles from these movies were sad and sweet and her recent film Black Swan - she was super-powerful and gave an Oscar Winning role as Nina!!! I was so happy after watching No Strings Attached - Natalie Portman was super, super FUNNY - she did an amazing job!!! There are scenes where Natalie Portman is over-the-top - but i think she was great... the amount of ''BAD WORDS'' in the movie is WOW... loads of it!!!The movie overall was good - Ashton Kutcher was alright & funny..... did an OK/ good job! The side-actors were average and the soundtracks were good...Anyways, No Strings Attached is a must-watch movie!My review: 7/10",7,14,31,25 February 2011
Titanic," The Best Movie Ever!
","Titanic is just fantastic, everything about this film is just wonderful from the actors, costumes, sets, music everything... Even the love story between Jack and Rose may not be true, it just feels so real when watching the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is just wonderful, his character Jack is so sweet and lovely. I am sure every girl wants a guy like Jack who has it all. Kate Winslet is just out-of-the-world as character Rose. She gave an Oscar winning performances in Titanic. Billy Zane plays his character Cal very well. Kathy Bates plays her character Molly Brown (Who is a real character) very, very, very well. She was the right actress for the role. All of the other cast members were fantastic!My favourite scenes are: Titanic re-lives, Rose Jumping Off the Titanic, Heart of the Ocean necklace, 3rd Class Dance, I'm flying, Rose drawing, the sinking of the Grand Staricase, the break-up of Titanic, the final moments of Titanic, the ending...James Cameron did a very good job in making this movie. For me, it is his best film. Again, for me Avatar may be the biggest movie of all time, but Titanic will remain as the biggest movie in my heart and head! Well, Titanic is still the second biggest film of all time... Also the I'M FLYING SCENE is the biggest and best scene in the history of Hollywood up to today.Overall a MUST SEE MOVIE! Get the DVD now! Even the deleted scenes were excellent...My Titanic review: 10/10 EXCELLENT!",10,1,2,18 November 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Fantastic film!
","I really like Revenge of the Sith! For me, it is the best in the Prequels!The amount of work put into this film is just outstanding, the CG work is super and the music is out-of-the-world even the sets, costumes, characters designs, props were all powerful. Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) gives a fantastic performance same goes for Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker/ Darth Vader) and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine). Natalie Portman (Padme Amidala) gives a very good performance! Well done. I was really sad when Natalie Portman's character Padme Amidala dies. The best scene for me would be when Padme gives birth to the twins Luke and Leia and when Anakin turns into Darth Vader fully!Anyways, ROTS is just wow, very good, FANTASTIC!Thank you so much George Lucas.",10,1,2,10 November 2010
