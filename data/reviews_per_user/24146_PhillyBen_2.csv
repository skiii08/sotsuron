The Blair Witch Project," Great premise & great ending; otherwise flawed
","I liked the Blair Witch Project, but I didn't love it. What I *did* love was the Blair Witch website that accompanied this film's release and also the mock-documentary that aired on the Sci Fi channel. If you read the website thoroughly and see the mock-documentary and THEN you watch the movie, it all adds up to a thoroughly frightening experience. Unfortunately, those extras were necessary because the movie itself left out a lot of crucial information vital to 'getting' the full import of the story and imagery.Still, the film did tap into (and probably fed) the growing fascination with 'reality' TV and films, and it used the trick on which camp ghost stories have always relied. It's really scary to be trapped in a place where something scary was REALLY supposed to have happened. Since most of us go into the woods at some point we can imagine how terrified the movie's kids must have been, and we can feel some of that terror ourselves if we think about the allegedly 'real' imagery when we're out in the woods.One final note: the 'reality'-based scare tactic wasn't even all that original. In 1992 the BBC aired a mock documentary called 'Ghostwatch' that pretended to be real, live-broadcast investigative journalism. Its shocking ending so terrified the television audience that it elicited hundreds of phone calls and was never aired again. THAT was a real landmark moment in mass media, right up there with Orson Welles' radio broadcast of 'War of the Worlds.'",7,0,1,4 November 2005
The Shining," Probably the BEST scary movie of all time!!!
","This movie is so darned good and scary that I get goosebumps just thinking about it. I have read the Stephen King novel and seen the movie and in my opinion the movie is MUCH scarier. King supposedly didn't like the ample changes that Kubrick made but I think that they improve the whole thing greatly.Jack Nicholson is freaky as heck and he pretty much sets the gold standard for all 'now-I'm-calm, now-I'm deranged' acting roles. (Robert DeNiro is also great at that kind of thing.) Shelly Duvall is fairly annoying, but in the novel Wendy was *supposed* to be kind of annoying. The hotel maze is a BIG improvement over the hedge-animals in the novel, and the twins are an incredible addition. (They weren't even in the novel at all.) The movie's ending is also MUCH better, scarier, and more satisfying than the novel's. (I love Stephen King but he often has a problem providing endings that match his novels' quality and scariness. See the novel 'IT' for a case in point. Pet Sematary is an exception.) I have seen many, many horror movies in my time and 'The Shining' sits atop my list. It's a masterpiece of suspense, creeping insanity, and things that go bump in the night. It's one of the very few films that I think merits a full 10 out of 10. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?",10,1,4,4 November 2005
