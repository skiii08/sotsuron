The Legend of Bagger Vance," authenticity, interpretation
","Interpretation, spoilers:Junuh, having spent many years as the local hero, becomes disillusioned when he discovers that his heroism does not cross over to the battle field. It takes Bagger Vance to teach Junuh that things such as heroic glory are of no importance compared to authenticity. For those of you current on modern ideas, the term `authentic' should immediately be recognized as an earmark of existentialism. Basically, in a godless world completely devoid of any intrinsic meaning, meaning can only be found in living `true to oneself,' authentically. To live for external rewards such as glory in the sporting arena is futile, because both winning and losing amount to the same thing in a meaningless world. Meaning can only be found subjectively through one's personal experience, existentially. Thus, both life and golf `can only be played, not won.'
The movie is basically a look at Junuh's gradual attainment of authenticity. His early days of golf stardom serve as a gigantic obstacle, because Junuh mistakenly believes that his authentic life is the same as his life of fame. The war shatters this ill-founded illusion, and now Junuh must come to grips with reality. Bagger has a sort of method in imparting authenticity onto Junuh. First, everything must be taken cheerfully calmly. Go with the flow and be yourself. There is no point frustrating yourself with the game of golf or the game of life. For Junuh, either his authentic self is a good golfer or it isn't, bellyaching will change absolutely nothing. Second, in order to be yourself, you must forget everyone else. This is symbolically shown when the crowd becomes imperceptible to Junuh, `it is just you and the ball.' This existential dictum is also demonstrated by Hardy's overcoming his shame of his father and his job. Hardy realizes that his father is living authentically by doing what he feels best, and the crowd reaction has no relevance whatsoever. Lastly, given the subjective nature of authenticity, it must be learned subjectively. Vance cannot just tell Junuh what to do. He can only prod and must let Junuh learn himself from his gains and mistakes.
This last point is illustrated by Junuh's misuse of the iron driver and by Vance's last hole vacancy. Vance cannot be around at the end, he needs Junuh to fully realize that he can only depend on himself to find his true self. When Vance allows Junuh to make the iron mistake, one of a few impediments to authenticity is shown. The three impediments in tension throughout the movie are: Junuh's heroism, Jones' perfectionism, and Hagen's womanization. Placing any one of these three dead ends over authenticity will leave one with a fake happiness. During the iron mistake, Junuh becomes infatuated with heroism, women, and the need for a perfect shot again. Thus the consequent fiasco. Luckily, he overcomes, and the movie concludes that through authenticity one attains true happiness. Junuh attains his true love of golf, his love of his woman, and everything works out. But, to be consistent, these last two triumphs should be taken as symbolically representing happiness. Authenticity is the major objective given, and Junuh is not happy because he has a girl and his game, but because he has himself. `The game can only be played, not won.'",6,0,1,7 August 2001
Requiem for a Dream," fantastic
","I could definately see why some people would not like this film - like the misogynist who cannot sit through anything without van damme. Yet, this movie is not not-liked because of lack of action, but because of its tragic characterization of life. Yes, this is a pessimistic, extremely pessimistic film. I, for one, happen to like tragedies, they're more real. If you're looking for a 'feel good' movie, skip this one, and go see 'annie' or something. Overall, great movie not just for the plot, but for the screen shots, the soundtrack, jennifer connelly =), and the acting in general. One the best movies I've seen I quit a long time. Also, check out 'pi' if you liked this. I wrote a paper about these two movies entitled 'aronofsky's duality as nihilistic'",10,0,0,27 March 2001
The Big Lebowski," everything
","Everything likable in movies, this movie has. Screenshots: the bowling scenes alone are spectacularly unique. Soundtrack: feel-good songs when needed and the nihilist music, perfect. Characterization: within exaggerated stereotypes, characters are unique and human as well. Comedy: an assortment of both high and lowbrow. Plot: unnoticably complex.   The too-often used movie description, 'enjoyable on many levels' speaks specifically towards 'the Big Lebowski.' A true classic for the true film buff.",8,0,1,5 June 2001
Fight Club," pain
","I'm sure you've all seen this by now, so I'll just tell you about my favorite theme in the movie. For the astute, you will have ascertained that the alluded-to theme is pain. We've been taught that pain and fighting is just in certain cases: fighting for self-defense, for love, for ones country. So why the controversy over 'Fight Club'? Because they fight for no apparent reason. Perhaps because of boredom with life. I wonder if there is ever a situation in which pain in and of itself could be a good thing. How much can you know about yourself, how truly free are you if pain is always secretly influencing your opinions? Remember the incident with the lye? Powerful, beautiful. I wrote a piece about a similar experience of mine entitled,'The Cross.'",10,0,1,9 April 2001
Citizen Kane," cute ending
","Upon being bombarded with descriptions of 'greatest movie ever' and 'if you plan on dying tomorrow, see this movie today,' I was somewhat dissapointed with the ending. I expected something profound, what I got was something trite and cute. By cute, I mean it has a great outward appearance, but after that...Perhaps I've been hanging out with too many far-leftists, but the messages like, 'the best things in life are free,' and 'you can't buy happiness' are so ordinary and commonsensical that you wonder why an entire movie would be based upon them. Maybe the modern or not so modern materialist would feel a euphoric epiphany and call this movie a great, but not I.
Besides that, there were other aspects of this movie to make it atleast worthwhile, or even good. Though it did move rather slowly, the characters were usually entertaining and the dialogue interesting. Moreso, the camera work was extraordinary and revolutionary, for its time. So you're constantly saying, 'This isn't great, but for its time...'  I'm not sure if I'm glad I saw this. Seems to be I only saw it so that I could say I saw it. Perhaps viewing this movie as a relative great and historical curiosity would be a better perspective to take and make the experience more enjoyable.",7,0,3,24 May 2001
Insomnia," How nice: Poetic justice and its problems.
","SPOILERS, interpretation: This movie is a good example of how contrived Hollywood movies can get when they believe poetic justice to be an absolute necessity. With poetic justice, since both Williams and Pacino commit a sin, they must both be punished. Williams must be punished most because his crime was committed with clear intent. So in the end, Williams receives his punishment when he dies. Pacino dies as well, but there is a difference between his death: he repents before he dies. So what was intimated from the beginning is affirmed: though both men work together and both have committed a sin, Williams clearly represents evil while Pacino represents good. With his repentance, Pacino is assured his place in heaven, and William's punishment will continue in his hell-bound afterlife. This is further evinced when Pacino falls asleep because his conscience is now clear. The problem with this, which is nicely explained in Hermann Hesse's Â‘Demian' is that a deathbed repentance is quite easy and convenient. Take the biblical story of the repentant thieve for example. Two thieves are crucified with Jesus. One insults Jesus and one repents to Jesus, and is thus granted entrance to heaven. But is it really so virtuous to live a life of sin and then repent when staring death in the eye? The repentance is not authentic, but fear based. Hence, both Williams and the non-repentant thief are the virtuous ones, for truly accepting their life and it's decisions and its consequences. A final scene in which Pacino isn't made to look heroic would have been much preferred, because 1) it's not so very trite and would possibly redeem some of the movie's slow and self-serious plot, and 2) it's more philosophically and religiously coherent.",5,1,1,25 May 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," not just a chick flick
","First thing, I had wanted to see this movie but almost did not go because of the main review which described this movie as 'Brill!' I thought, 'Oh god, not only is this a chick flick, it's a teenage chick flick.' Gladly, I overcame my apprehensions and came over to the movie house...Though this definitely could be considered a chick flick, there must be something else to it; for, I do not enjoy the typical chick flick. Thinking back at the most humorous scenes, I believe it was the dialogue that made this movie enjoyable for me.I, you see, am a regular word smith, a true logophiliac. When a movie has no plot, or a disagreeable plot, or a predictable plot, creative conversationist nuances can certainly bring a movie forward. For example, at one point Mark refers to Bridget's speaking skills as 'verbal incontinence.' Later, referring back to that comment, Bridget uses the phrase, 'verbal diarrhea.' Another time, Bridget comes to work skimpily clad. Her boss asks if her skirt is 'home sick.' Bridget replies that her skirt is indeed present and that his attitude must represent some sort of biased 'size-ist' ideology. Those are the first two instances I could think of. I found them quite amusing.But if such subtleties to not amuse you, I'm sure you may enjoy this movie for it's chick-flick aspects. Aspects include: problems in dieting, embarrassment of 'spinsterhood' (another gem of verbosity), self-pity followed by triumph!, and other such not-nearly-as-unique-as-the-dialogue scenes. Just to brag a bit, SPOILERS, I did predict both ending and the cloths misconception and cheating misconception that allowed for said ending to occur. Yet this was not a plot movie for me, so it did not detract from anything, for me.Also, I thought the fact that the heroine was to purposely game weight for the movie was a refreshing change. Although more plump than when sleeping with Jerry Mcquire, Renee was not over-ripe and did a fantastic job. The accent did not hurt either, scruptous.One more thing I thought was interesting, if not contradictory or revealing reverse sexism. Why does - yet another SPOILER - Bridget finally wise up and drop the cheating dog Daniel, while Mrs. Jones leaves Mr. Jones to go have a month long orgy with a television star and he takes her back with no thought whatsoever? There is only one answer: miss Mcquire and her feminine agenda do that think a man can get past his self-pity enough to escape his dependence on an unfaithful partner, while Bridget has no problem doing this even before she learns the truth of the cheating misconception.
That was partly joking, because I do not remember having ever seen a movie with a female director. Yet I give you kudos, miss Mcquire, for making a film with two levels of enjoyability.",7,0,0,23 May 2001
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," interpretation
","Interpretation, spoilers: Two main struggles are woven together throughout this movie: the struggle between censorship and free speech and that regarding our role in Vietnam.
The struggle with censorship ends in compromise. During his visit with the troops, Robin realizes that the happiness and morale of the troops is more important than voicing every bit of controversial news. Humorous satire and sarcasm are one thing, and even lighten the burden of the soldiers, but reading unofficial news of the sort he did was completely unnecessary. There is no point in scaring the soldiers by telling them of bombings in demilitarized when nothing can be done to alleviate the problem and only learned helplessness will result. But, the censored news could have saved Robin a lot of trouble at another point. Basically, in this conflict between oppressor and oppressee, rebellion for the sake of rebellion is pointless and counteractive - as demonstrated by the final address and every post-suspension show. Concerning the war itself a liberal position is taken. The human side of the Vietcong is shown, though secretly at first, and Robin shows his compassion for the enemy by risking his life in order to tell him of his death warrant. In order to make the liberal ideal come out less preachy, the young rebel himself proclaims it. Also, this leftistness is kept in check with Robin's chastisement over the bombings. Their intentions are well and good, but their actions are not.  Perhaps it seems out of place to speak of these aspects of the movie in a comedy; I think they definitively outshadowed the comedic aspects. Though I was able to catch most of the war references, much of the musical references and era references were beyond me. So maybe my age was a factor, but it would have to be damn funny to overshadow the dramatic issues posed by the war. Overall, 6 of 10, somewhat entertaining from a educational perspective.",6,4,9,5 June 2001
Edward Scissorhands," more racist than a Jackson facelift
","Interpretation, Spoilers:On the surface, this movie is a quaint suburban fairy tale; in actuality, it is laden with symbolic racist propaganda. The fact that Edward is the only member of the scissorhands immediately gives him minority status. He lives in the run-down part of town which is basically taboo to visit - unless you're a desperate avon lady or a blood thirsty lynch mob. Saying the house is haunted is a euphemistic way of saying the ghetto is dangerous and not to be frequented. Likewise, the polarity between the unpleasant darkness of Edward and his abode with the unseemly brightness of both the town and town folk is further illustrated by Edward's dark attire - completely black from head to toe. Edward's skin is not black because that would be too honest for Mr. Burton. Instead, Ed's inferiority is hinted at in that his skin is seen as unpresentable and in need of drastic cosmetic refurbishment. Also, Ed is shown to be mentally unstable and manipulatable and even assumed to be a master criminal. In the end, Kim tells Ed that she loves him, but conveniently refuses to visit him for the remainder of her life although he lives just down the street: it is not acceptable for her to associate with the subspecies scissorhands. A modern lynch mod drives Edward out of town and back into his isolated, decrepit pit. Symbolically, they have 'shown him his place.' Understanding this, Ed remains alone for the rest of his days; but, we are visually assured, he is happy with his sculptures. Conclusion: not only is segregation desired, those oppressed by it also desire it. And, racial mixing is never to be tolerated.   However, and hopefully, this film could be interpretated as an anti-racism satire. Prejudice of Edward was overcome twice in the film. Those who met him were able to see past his unique body (his handicap!) and one other person stood up for him: unsurprisingly, the police officer - the only truly black character in the film. Thus, there is hope of transcending racial stereotyping, but the end-of-the-film renunciation by both Kim and Edward seem to tell against this more politically correct interpretation.
Either way, this movie is watchable if simply to help demonstrate our still backwards racial morality.",7,2,12,4 June 2001
American History X," excellent

The Usual Suspects," cheap thrill ending?
","spoilers:Should this movie be considered a cheap-thrill-ending movie because there is no real allusion to the ending through out the entire movie? It's definitely arguable, because any director could put the exact same ending on any movie and it would always be surprising that a complex story could be simply ad libbed. I disagree however, and think that the confusion results from an unwarranted comparison between other trick-ending movies like 'fight club' and the 'sixth sense.' In these movies, the viewer's understanding of a seemingly simple plot is destroyed at the end. The movie is actually quite complex and there is trail of evidence supporting the new ending. Only the end-perspective gained can explain everything. But in 'the usual suspects,' both perspectives (Spacey telling the truth or Spacey as Soza) explain everything in the movie. The only reason the latter explanation is chosen is to demonstrate this. Comparisons between 'usual' and 'fight/sixth' lacks the relevant similarity in movie structure.",7,0,1,9 November 2001
The Usual Suspects," cheap-thrill ending
","I remember when I was a kid writing stories. If I couldn't think of a good ending, you know what I'd do? Have the main character wake up in a state of heartbeating sweaty relief: Thank god it was only a dream... And you know what? The usual suspects has the exact same type of ending. The reason it is cheap is that this ending could be attatched to any movie whatsoever. There was nothing tying it together with the rest of the entire movie besides maybe a few seconds of Spacey looking at the police corkboard. If you want to do a surprise ending, you need to have evidence throughout the movie to tie it together. Examples are fight club and the sixth sense, regardless of their other merits, they definitely did the surprise ending the right way. You could watch the movie a second time and get have an entirely new experience. All along you're saying, 'ohhhhh, I get it now. That's why he did that.' Usual Suspects was not a great surprise ending movie, but it did have some respectable dialogue and characters. 7 of 10.",7,0,1,29 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," so-so
","SPOILER?---> I found the plot of this movie to be ridiculous. Instead of the usual revenge-for-murdered-loveone plot, we find a revenge-for-stolen-magic-green-sword plot. Hmm. Granted, this was not supposed to be a plot movie. They just needed a bare minimum that allowed maximum elbow room for the fight scenes. I can understand why everyone praises these scenes. They were beautiful and surreal... at first. There were different scenes and different fight sequences throughout, but they all seemed like the same drawn-out scene to me.

The Elephant Man," the cathedral. interpretation
","Spoilers: Most likely, John had been raised an orphan until the time when he had been taken into the freak show. More so, he had been beaten often and treated like an animal. In a life of punishment and obeying to avoid more punishment, John had been living in order to achieve the interests of his master, never himself. Upon emancipation from this nefarious situation, John's life becomes devoted to self discovery, realization, and confidence.
Yet John cannot even begin to engage with his self if he cannot even engage with others. With the help of the good doctor, this language barrier is overcome. First words are anxious and reserved, but through continued conversation he becomes more self-confident. Moving John from the isolation ward to the normal area is symbolic of his traversing the language barrier.
With his newfound ability to communicate with others, he can finally communicate with himself and magnify his search for self. Beginning the construction of his cathedral is symbolic of John's beginning search.
At first, he builds only the part of the cathedral viewable from his window. This represents the first stages of his search for self. He begins by coming to grips with his only-viewable aspect, his deformed body. By ending his veiled days, he shows his overcoming of his previous self-dislike.
Later, he further tests his identity by engaging in talks with females. Extraordinary courage is needed to put himself in a position of possible rejection and even hysterics. (This tension between desire for females and fear of repulsion is first alluded to when the doctor states that although John has abnormalities over 90% of his body, his genitals were completely unharmed) Throughout these journeys into self-discovery, his cathedral is symbolically becoming taller and taller. Yes, these are abstract journeys, but even the abstractness is symbolized in the cathedral. After he gets past the appearances of cathedral/body he must, as he states, use his imagination for the remainder. He must go deeper and discover the hidden self - not only his deformity, but his emotional relationship and understanding with it. Just as his self-concept is coming to light, an eclipse occurs. A group of sight-seers shows up in his room and thoroughly dehumanizes John while at the same time destroying his new self-image of someone more than a freak show attraction. Likewise, the cathedral is also destroyed during this misadventure. However, when John goes into public and stands up for himself ('I am not an animal!') and when he attends his first opera, he has finally overcome his greatest fears. The cathedral is completed and from the few visible towers, a magnificent foundation is discovered. John has finally come to complete self-realization and acceptance. Yet, he is not happy with the completed picture. He sees that if it took such hardships and struggle for he himself to accept himself, there is no chance of the outside world reaching this perspective. Sadly, self-realization coincides with self-destruction and John leaves this wickedly cruel planet. But both John's built cathedral and remembered image will stand for a long time to come, he will never truly die. Great movie, great ending!",9,0,0,24 May 2001
Pi," Stupendous ending! Interpretation...
","I already wrote a general review of this and a paper as well, but after seeing the reviews describing 'Pi' as 'useless confusion' and such, I thought I should help abate this confusion. To make it short, I'll just give my interpretation of the ending. MAJOR SPOILERS!:The ending of 'Pi' is not great simply because of its use of metaphors, but because these metaphors had been a major theme throughout the movie and the ending is the perfect climax to this progressing film.
1.) The scene directly preceding Max's discovery shows him wandering the crowded streets. This is a metaphor linked to the Archimedes metaphor used by his mentor. Archimedes could not come up with a conclusion because he needed perspective - taking a bath in this case. Both Archimedes and Max were reclusive types who needed to 'take a step back' in order to solve their problem. Thus, Max had to get outside, and take a walk. Although he had been outside previously, never had he for the immense amount of time in this scene - hours and hours. Yet this is only elliptically stated. The scene is in fast motion and loud music somewhat distorts Max's words. Max is repeating times. He spent nearly half a day walking around, though the scene lasted only seconds. This new perspective for the hermit Max allows him to reach pi.  2.) Max then finds Pi or 'god' (look up TOE, Theory Of Everything if interested in the metaphysical underpinnings). During this discovery, he starts blurting out random numbers, a reference to earlier scenes in which the computer had discovered pi and spit out the 216 digit number. Thus, just as the computer had been, Max became completely aware of nature and conscious of himself. 3.) Upon his discovery, Max finds himself in a blank white world. There is nothing there. Ultimately, I don't think this means that there is no 'god,' but that it is completely void of meaning and inhumane. The void is illustrated by showing Max evaporating into the backdrop. He realizes the importance of human interaction when a flash of caressing hands are flashed into his world of whiteness. When he comes out, he is further caressed by an unseen women - most likely his neighbor. Whiteness and woman-ness are used to illustrate the emptiness and mathematical sterility of pi.
4.) Consequently, Max takes a drill to his head. A metaphor attempting to show that the search for pi is self-destructive is interwoven throughout the film: his mentor has a stroke when he continues his research on pi, Max had dreams about destroying brains after his near-pi encounters, and the fact that medicine is needed to combat the affects of said near-pi encounters. It is only in the final scene that Max realizes this, forgoes his medicine, and finally finds pi. Afterwards, the drilling represents the unwantedness of searching for pi because of its self-destruction and ultimate meaninglessness to humans. 5.) Finally, in the end Max has given up his searching, and can finally live life. He can't answer the little girl's math questings anymore and has no need to constantly repeat his theory to himself. The movie ends with him smiling. He had never smiled throughout the entire film, and moreso, had never ever seemed to be emotionally indifferent - he was always anxious and easily disturbed. The smile is a powerful piece of imagery that puts a final stamp on a great film.",10,1,4,10 May 2001
Pi," fannnntastic
","I hate to sound arrogant and pretentious, but I'll say it:'If you did not like this movie you didn't think hard enough!' Even if unfamiliar with the philosophical underpinnings, there are a plethora of other reasons do like this movie. Namely, the soundtrack, the metaphors, the emotion, the screen shots, and probably the best ending I've ever seen. Basically, if you see this movie once, you'll be confused, but confusion is too often used as an license to criticize. I wrote a paper about this entitled 'Aronofsky's Duality as Nihilistic.'",10,1,4,8 April 2001
The Piano," passion, not love
","Interpretation, spoilers: The box for this movie states, 'only one man (Harvey Keitel) understands that Ada's heart can only be won through her beloved piano.' I must disagree. After decades of hollywood love stories, we now have a love movie schema to use in watching and interpreting films of this sort. Expressed in words, it might be something like 'love conquers all' or something of the such. Implied in this schema is that the love is of extraordinary meaning and almost heavenly. It's a nice sort of message, but it biases our movie-watching experience; i.e. 'the Piano.' Though Ada's love for Harvey is of a merely carnal, animalistic sort, this should not interfere with the power of this movie. After the move, a dichotomy between the white man and the aborigines is formed. The white man represents propriety and decorum. The aborigines represent primitive human passion and unrefinement. Case in point: the scene in which the daughter is chastised for playing the aborigine tree-humping game. This point is further illustrated by Ada's confining wardrobe and aborigine/Harvey chats about his need for a woman. Thus, Harvey is associated with the primitive bodily passions of the aborigines. It is this passionate essence of Harvey that attracts Ada to him. It would be ridiculous to claim that the piano in which Harvey blackmailed Ada and nearly prostituted her with made them fall in love (It did in a purely indirect phsyicalist way by bringing them together, it was the passion that made them actually fall in love.) The fact that the piano is not equated with love is the fact that Ada's feelings remain the same after the piano is brought to Same Neill's house. Two types of expression are prominently displayed in this movie: through music and through passion/body. After Harvey teaches Ada to communicate with passion, her piano is no longer needed. Music is renounced and passion taken up. However, with the passion option, a living-in-the-present will comes along. This will follows the dictates of her every desire and she cannot control it. It causes her to flirt with death, but her next split second decision to free herself affirms life. Living passionately, the only constant in her non-meditative will is her will to live.
Perhaps a more than carnal love develops later. This is alluded to with her transcending over bodily communication to actual language. But, the movie itself is not a love story of the typical sort, and I for one am all for showing the love-aspects of each type of love-relationship. I think the main message is that even passionate love is a worthwhile love, and if anything 'conquers all,' it is the will to live.",8,0,4,31 May 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," fair start for Guest
","After having just seen 'Best of Show,' I can see the many similarities in these two movies. Many of the same actors appear in each, the dialogue flows in the same way, and the comedy employs satire, visual humor and free association humor. 'Best of Show,' however, uses each of these facets superbly more efficaciously.For one, 'Spinal Tap' has no plot. The band goes on tour, it doesn't go well, so they get another tour. Yes, it is based on a true story; but I'm sure the real band had some conflict, tension, climax, and conclusion, in their careers. Some tension was even hinted at between David's wife and Nigel, but nothing comes of it. The David/Nigel conflict itself is under developed, as is the reunion.Also, the visual humor directed at the Tap wardrobe gets old fast. It's funny - for a few minutes - to see the 80's rock style with the long scrappy hair and loud hot pants. The same diminishing humor can be equated with the rock behavior during the concerts - concerning the spread eagles and facial contorsions.'Best of Show' gets past this decreasing utility by scripting a wide array of unique characters - showing that Guest had learned from his mistakes. Since 'Spinal Tap' cannot do this, other types of humor must be used to fill the void.The off the top of the head free association humor is what this crew does best. The '11' scene and the 'little bread' scene are perfect examples. These amount to really to only enjoyable parts of the movie.Basically, this movie represents a nice early try and good attempt for Guest and company. His later films correct many of the lackings of 'Spinal Tap.' So it's good as a historical film for anyone interested in this cast.",6,0,4,23 June 2001
Life Is Beautiful," Schopenhauer
","The first time I saw this movie I didn't remember the references to Schopenhauer, but now I've read said philosopher and was thinking about the point in using him in this movie. At first it seems like a mistake. After all, Schopenhauer is of the major philosophers, the most pessimistic. So it's strange to have him portrayed positively in such an optimistic movie. I think the movie is reinterpreting his philosophy from an optimistic perspective. Reinterpretation is a strong part of all classic works. For example, Virginia Woolfe has a crazy man interpret Shakespeare as being a misanthrope in 'Mrs. Dalloway.' Basically, Schopenhauer says that humans are conditioned by evolution to choose life over everything horrible that could happen, and that we have no choice but to obey. 'Life is Beautiful' takes this reality to be a positive. Really, it's an affirmation of the inherent goodness of life. So I think the Schopenhauer references work perfectly here.",10,4,7,28 June 2002
A Clockwork Orange," the book
","With only the movie, the main theme may be deciphered, but it's stated more vaguely than in the book. SPOILERS, interpretation:'A Clockwork Orange' is the title of the book Home Guy was writing. Alex reads the first page before he rapes the guy's wife. The book is about the negative consequences of imposing human law and order onto the natural self. Alex later, in the book, spouts off a similar rant.The movie and book are an argument for man's inherent evilness. It's an argument against the popular liberal enlightenment idea that man is born inherently good, and evil only later results as an effect of corrupt governments. Alex no longer can commit evil in the end - though he can still will it - but he also has a breakdown and random hallucinations - he is not 'cured' according to Burgess. According to Burgess, humans cannot be cured of evilness because it is a part of their authentic self. Rid yourself of evil, and rid yourself of yourself. SPOILERS END, point of interest: I was quite surprised when I learned that the girl Billyboy and his gang almost raped and the two girls Alex has sex with were all only ten years old! - in the book that is. Also, the latter two girls are not as willing as the movie makes it seem. Really, Alex rapes them. He leaves them 'bruised' and fighting him off with 'punchipunchies.'",9,0,0,21 November 2001
Reservoir Dogs," eh
","I can't rid myself of this feeling that the only thing supporting this movie is a cheap-thrill ending. It turns out so-and-so was the cop all along and it's quite ironic. It was a nice little idea, cute even; but it's not enough to found an entire movie. In instances such as these, dialogue must be employed to fill the void. There were a few nice quote, such as, 'If you ever dream about killing me you better apologize in the morning,' but not enough. Moreso, with a lack of plot and dialogue - I mean good plot and good dialogue ofcourse - unique characters are a last option to save a movie. Maybe it's because of the already saturated american mafia movie genre, but I was never really connected with any of the characters. (Although Buschemi was good, but he is always good) Without any viable options, I'm afraid the Terrentino option was employed: If you don't have a movie with a doable plot, play the movie in backwards segments and hope nobody notices.",7,0,1,29 April 2001
Army of Darkness," not scary, not funny!
","I am not averse to mixing comedy and horror, but if the individual aspects themselves are worthless, how can you expect the aggregate to magically gain some substance? Impossible, just ask your local symbolic logicist.
Simply watch the first five minutes and you will realize that the horror department is bankrupt, comedy must come to the rescue.
With corny comedy, there's that which is funny because it is so absurd or so obvious that the mellowed air of the laid back film promotes laughter. Army's brand of corny comedy was more of a 'it's funny because it's stupid' humor. If this is your type of humor go for it, but for me, 'Army' is a 'Princess Bride' without the dialogue and a 'Naked Gun' without the jokes. Now that is funny, think of watching 'Naked Gun' without the jokes. It's actually not, and never again shall I.",3,3,9,5 May 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," hope vs. certainty
","Interpretation, spoilers: Brooks represents complete complacency with life, so much so that any disturbance causes anxiety and suicidal ideation. Red also, for a time, represents this complacency. This movie is not simply a prison story, its message is generalized to mankind in general and it can be assumed that this complacency also represents modern man's need for routine - to the detriment of authentic living. It takes an unjustly imprisoned man, Andy, to demonstrate to Red the life-or-death importance of hope and the freedom allowed by hope. As shown, hope entails slight fear because it necessarily interferes with order in life. Andy illustrates that this fear is a part of living, and renunciation from it results in an ingenuine sort of living. Red soon realizes - given the rock hammer, the poster, and the mexico plans - that Andy had never given up his hope despite 19 years in prison. Hope and a sense of freedom and allowed even in prison, but not to all (music scene). For Red, it takes an actual physical freedom to live with a sense of hope. Andy, by exuding auras of hope from the beginning - though he would be expected to despair the most given his innocence - helps Red reach an epiphany of sorts; certainty and hope are mutually exclusive, and hope is always to be preferred. The Brook's path is shirked, and Red chooses life in all of its confusion, because true hope is omnipotent.",9,0,0,1 June 2001
Vanilla Sky," patronizing
","Spoilers, interpretation:I really liked this movie until the patronizing ending. The audience is treated like morons. The movie ends, and then for some reason the makers feel the need to tack on an extra forty-five minutes to explain the movie. Maybe they thought it'd make more money if it was dumbed down a bit? Possibly, but I think the biggest motivating factor was the need for a more romanticized ending. You can't very well let the audience leave in a gloomy mood because they think David will remain in his nightmare forever, can you?
I can tell you how to fix this movie: just don't add any unnecessary emotionalism. Don't lie to the audience and pretend that this a happy movie. To do this, there is a simple solution: end the movie when David takes his psychologist to L.E. Go all the way through with the little movie presentation, and then have the psychologist ask David once again, 'Did you sign something with these people?' David looks on with a blank/confused/terrorized face, and the movie ends. This is the ideal ending because at this point, everything in the movie is explained. Instead we get forty-five minutes of re-explanation, patronization.Yet there are two new sub-themes added in the extra time. They are new, unnecessary, and done for the sake of drama, melodrama really. First, David kills himself. There is absolutely no reason for this. He has a malady that cannot be fixed, therefore he could just as easily have himself frozen without the suicide. David's death is contrived pathos. It also works to consummate his relationship with Sofia. Aww, how nice, she still loves him, 'she knew him better than anyone else' even though she only saw him once - more pathos. Second, there is the ending in which David decides that real life is better than dream, continuing along in that naive Matrixesque vein. Again, this is just pointless melodrama because tragedies don't sell. It's dishonest and denial and patronizing , but 'the answer to 99 of 100 questions is money.'Two flagrant examples of patronization. First, the L.E. lady tells David that he can be forever in a dream and David asks, 'Couldn't it be a nightmare?' Moments later he reaches an epiphany and shouts 'This is a nightmare!' Second, standing on the roof, David asks, 'I set up this whole scenario didn't I?' 'Yes,' the dream technician replies, 'you had to face your fear of heights.' These are examples of stating the obvious, spelling it out for you, treating you like children, that the ending is wrought with.
Technical problems. In cryonization, the brain is dead. Hence, no dreams are possible. A coma would have been the rational choice. Plus it would have added interest to have the entire movie last one moment ('You can change your life in a moment') than 150 years; not to mention the fact that it would have made Sofia's 'Hello David' upon awakening realistic. Also, there is the problem that by definition, a lucid dream is one that the dreamer is aware he is having. The movie makes it seem that the entire dream is lucid, while only the ending, after he returns to L.E. is.During the movie I was planning on giving it a 9, but after that ending I lowered my rating to a 7. The fact that I'm more of an interpreter than a reviewer probably plays a role.",7,1,2,11 January 2002
