Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Great Story
","To all you shallow people out there who have said that this movie had no plot, go take a long walk on a short pier. This movie isnt really intended to be a movie on its own. It is a foreshadowing of things to come. The blockade of Naboo was just a setup. Jinn said that the Trade Federation stood to gain nothing from the blockade, and they didn't but Sidous did. Sidous/Palpatine wanted to get rid of Chancellor Vellorum by making the Senate seem to no longer function. Thereby Amidala got Vellorum thrown out and Palpatine elected as Supreme Chancellor. Thus Palpatine slowly begins to form his New Order, and being Chancellor helps this. The entire movie is a prelude to the other 5 movies. This is a movie for Hardcore Star Wars fans to understand.",Null,0,0,10 April 2000
