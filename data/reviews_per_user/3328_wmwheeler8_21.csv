Captain Phillips," One of the better 'based on true story' films I've seen
","This film is the true story of the 2009 hijacking of a US container ship named Maersk Alabama off the Horn of Africa. Tom Hanks plays captain Phillips who is taken hostage during the event. The American military comes to the aid of Phillips as the his hostage takers make a run for their home country of Somalia. The story is told from both sides and obviously takes over a Hollywood feel. What the crew and captain had to go through is beyond rational thought. Hanks gives of course another believable performance that has a bit of Castaway feel towards the end. This movie is as good as advertised, and you won't be disappointed.",7,0,1,22 May 2014
Catch Me If You Can," Excellent film
","The real story about a a boy would learns the art of forgery. He forged checks, passports, diplomas and leads the FBI on a long wild goose chase until he's finally caught. He ends up spending the rest of time working with the FBI to catch other forgers.",9,0,1,25 August 2019
Rocketman," Smashing
",A rock biopic about Mr. Elton John. Well done. Very entertaining. The music was inputted perfectly with the story. Felt seamless. Taron Egerton continues to prove that he is a Hollywood Star. This guy can do it all. Wow!,7,1,1,29 September 2019
A Star Is Born," Good not great
","Not the end all be all movie that everyone has made it out to be. A very good directorial debut by cooper. He put in a ton of work for this film. It's said he took voice lessons for over a year. Tho is the forth time this movie has been done, and yeah it's probably the best one, but still just a good not great movie.",6,0,0,27 August 2019
Fury," Decent story poor execution.
","The story of a tank unit fighting in WWII Germany. Outmanned and out gunned fighting their way through Nazi territory. Brad pit leads this cast and actually gives a good performance. Supported by Shia Labeouf who is the tanks gunman. As they travel from town to town the encounter various types of resistance from the German army. Time and time the little tank unit is tested and each time they are the bond between them grows and grows. The plot is quite intriguing however the execution was a miss. The gun fights look like they are straight out of Star Wars. Red and green lasers firing across the battlefield, I actually did a double take. I kept waiting for a Jedi to swoop in and take out some storm troopers. Predictability ran throughout the whole movie right down to the different type of men in the unit. The newbie, the bible thumper, the renegade, the minority, and of course the hard nose leader that stares death in the face and never gives up especially when the odds are overwhelming. War is terrible and the movie does show that but nothing makes it stand out over others.",5,1,7,12 July 2015
X-Men," Great adaptation from comic to big screen
","In the Marvel universe few superheroes are more well known then the X-Men. The X-Men are a group of mutants lead by professor Charles Xavier ( Patrick Stewart ) that defend both humans and other mutants from those that would seek harm onto others. In this story their most common foe Magneto ( Ian McKellen) has the power to control metals and magnetic fields devises a plan to turn humans into mutants. Xavier and his team including Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) Storm ( Halle Berry) Cyclopes, Rogue, and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) fight to stop magneto and his mutant followers. The action packed fights along with the special effects gives this movie just what the fans want in anticipation of seeing their childhood heroes come to life. Good for the whole family and entertaining. The best superhero movie since Batman.",9,1,2,22 May 2014
Ready Player One," 80's kid dream come true
","If you have ever wanted to see all of your favorite characters in one movie this is the movie for you. This movie will bring out the nerd in every kid that grew up in the 80's. The story is easy to fall in love with plenty of fun and action. You end up feeling like you could be friends with the characters. Wonderful soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly straight from the opening credits. This movie is too good to spoil much but I will leave you with this: Back to the Future, King Kong, Halo, Thundercats, Marvin the Martian, Bigfoot, Tron, old school bat mobile and Boba Fett. Dozens and dozens of other pop culture references that you will have to watch the movie over and over to see them all. This movie is more entertaining than a game of Frogger",9,4,8,18 July 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Typical spike lee film
","Fun story. Easy to get into and watch. Actors played their parts well. Wasn't impressed but I wasn't disappointed. Even though I agree with him, I Could have done without Spike Lee's politics before the credits but I understand why he did it. Nevertheless a good movie.",7,0,4,3 June 2019
"I, Robot"," I, love I, Robot
",New take on the robot society future. Good execution and nice script. Will Smith is great as usual and rather perfect in his role of a cop that doesn't trust robots in a society that is pretty much dependent on them. Lots of action ties together in a mystery. Enjoyable movie very rememberable and fun to watch again and again.,7,1,1,4 September 2019
Yesterday," Interesting but no answers
","In this movie a struggling musician wakes up from an accident and realizes he is the only person left in the world that remembers the Beatles. They are completely erased from history. So he starts performing their songs and becomes famous.
Interesting story tied together with a love story but no resolution. Left me with unanswered questions.",5,0,1,17 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Perfect culmination of a generational saga
","After all this time, after all the movies, after all the laughs and battles we finally get to witness the end to the biggest movie saga of our lifetime. Never before has an endeavor so grand been accomplished and achieved.
Avengers Endgame lived up to the expectations and all hype. Per usual Marvel form Wndgame provided a wonderful story filled with action, plenty of laughs and more stars than we could keep track of.
This movie gave me chills and had me wondering what would happen next. I know phase four of the MCU is in our future but this culmination of over 10 years of movies was the pinnacle for me. I doubt Marvel will be able to top this story.
I won't be spoiling anything here but just know there will be plenty of laughs, tears and tense moments. It's a fantastic ending to the Avengers story. Or is it?? Can't wait to see what comes next.",9,2,6,30 April 2019
Foxcatcher," Olympic silver
","This movie is based on the true events of Olympic champion wrestlers Mark and David Schultz and their odd relationship with eccentric millionaire John Du Pont. The story centers around Mark (Channing Tatum) who is first to develop a relationship with wrestling enthusiast Du Pont (Steve Carrell). Du Pont wants so badly to be the coach of the next Olympic gold medalist and takes Mark under his wing. Mark's older brother David (Mark Ruffalo) has always looked out for his younger brother and begins to worry. Du Pont convinces David to join them at his estate. Once there David realizes his brother isn't the same and has questions the validity of Du Ponts actions. After a loss in the '88 Soule Olympics things really take a turn for the worse, which tragically ends terrible for the brothers as Du Ponts grip on reality slips away. I went into this movie not knowing any of the actual story and I found myself wanting badly to step in and do something. It really is a tragic and odd story. Overall the movie is well put together and Carrell is outstanding as John Du Pont. Ruffalo and Tatum were fantastic as the brothers Schultz. They trained so much you'd think they actually wrestled in school. That being said, this one isn't for me. I can't place my finger on it but I just couldn't get into it. The story crawled along at a snails pace and the development of the characters was choppy. Happy the writers and director cut the film from the original 4 hours of tape. See it if you must but don't set valued time aside for it.",6,0,1,8 September 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Everything we've waited for
","10 years and 18 movies, we've waited and waited for our childhood fantasies to come to the big screen. This movie doesn't disappoint. In true marvel form, it gives us all the action and laughter we want, along with a wonderfully put together story. Bringing together this cast of well established characters was an awesome feat and done to perfection. Each character has their own set of little things that make them great and it was truely cinematic gold to watch these hero's meet one another. Action packed and edge of your seat adventure. There are surprises and cliffhangers and I'm sure Infinity Wars 2 will be just as entertaining.",10,2,8,27 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Besides Pitt the movie was a waste
","Very lethargic and pointless. So much of this movie made no sense to the entirety the film. Aside from Pitt's character the movie was a waste.Now, it's no secret that I am not a huge fan of Tarantino. Most of his movies I don't watch more than once. This one will not be an exception. Yeah, the camels are cool, the somewhat truth behind some of the story was a stretch and really didn't tie together. Far too long and slow.I absolutely understand why Bruce Lee's people were upset with his portrayal in the movie. It was completely out of character according to anyone that has ever given an account of Bruce. It wasn't meaningful to the movie, it was poorly done, and deserves the criticism it received.Aside from a few movies (helped by great actors) Tarantino is mediocre. This movie was on par with that.2.5 bags of popcorn üçø out of 5",5,3,4,22 December 2019
Aladdin," Great live adaptation
",Wow. Obviously it's not as good as the original. Will smith made the genie his own. He did not try to be robin williams and that was great. Added some original songs and that was fine. Altered the story just a tad but it worked. Overall it's the best love adaptation yet.,7,0,2,22 August 2019
Big Hero 6," Big hero 6 scores big
","Big Hero 6 is a fun and entertaining movie for all ages. A superhero movie not like what you're used to. Surprisingly witty and well written story with a great underlined message to tell. I first watched this movie with my children but soon found myself turning it on without them. The story follows a young boy named Hiro. His brother Tadashi (a robotics student) wants him to do something with his life. Tadashi convinces Hiro to audition for the robotics school.

I liked the story but when push came to shove the special effects were sub par and it didn't give me goose bumps. That stands for something where I come from. It's OK if you have nothing else to do.",5,3,4,22 May 2014

He then spends the better part of a year living in the airport. He learns English, makes friends, finds love, and becomes more than just another face at the airport.

The Blind Side," Excellent film the whole family can get into
","This is based on the real life story of left tackle Michael Oher of the Baltimore Ravens. His struggle living on the streets of Memphis Tennessee and being taken in by a loving wealthy family. Quinten Aaron portrays Michael and gives and outstanding performance. He is living on his own when he is accepted into a Christian school in hopes he can play sports. Sandra Bullock is the mother with a heart that takes him in and shows him what a family is all about. His struggles in the classroom don't make for a great fit for making the team, but with the help of his new family he knows no boundaries and gives it everything he has. The movie is inspiring and beautifully told. After watching this flick I am upset with myself for not seeing sooner. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you do. Hurry!",9,1,2,22 May 2014
Green Book," Splendid movie
",Some movie that are nominated and win awards don't actually deserve it. This is not an example of that. This movie deserves all the accolades it receives. Wonderful directing. Screenwriting was perfect. Cast was spot on. I really enjoyed this movie.,7,1,2,11 September 2019
