The Blair Witch Project," scared me to death
",the reasons why this movie is so good is because it is so real(i know its not)and it gives you a sense of fear because you feel what they are going through.and to make you shiver the cinema that i went to see it in was freezing i think they turned up the air conditioning on purpose to add to the feel of the movie,10,1,2,26 January 2000
