The Avengers," OK - so how much money has this production cost again?!
","OK so you have Marvel's most iconic superheroes, thrown together in a battle against giant creatures and evil bad guys - how may this concept fail? Lazy authors, bad budget, lame love-stories! Good to see that none of these problems are present here. What you get is maybe just the best superhero-movie of all time.Consider this: You have had all back stories of the protagonists (minus two who barely need one to be awesome) and the movie just jumps right to the action. Of course there are some (necessary) find-and-fight-together scenes but until the end credits roll, you get it all: Good versus the bad, good versus the good (seriously! Awesome!) and good versus the bad versus the good - you better order some new pants during the show! Apart from spoiling too much (which I really don't want to) I have to tell you, that the screenplay and the graphics you'll see in the movie, are top-notch all together and especially the non-superpower-heroes really shine.Trust the dialogue, trust the performance and last but not least trust the critics: If you like these kind of movies, you NEED to see this to die happy.Hint: If you see this in a movie theater wait until after the final credits ..",10,2,8,27 May 2012
The Prestige," My favorite movie for a reason
","People tend to react really hyped when it comes to movies they really enjoyed. We leave the movie theater and compare stuff we liked, which impressed us and stuff which we didn't. 7 years have passed since I watched 'The Prestige' for the first time and although I must have watched the movie for several times now, I never feel totally 'in control' over my emotions. The central question about ethical behavior around which this movie has been built never seems to be as clear or as easy to answer as the ones all the other movies I have watched have presented to me. The Prestige is build like a 'magic trick' which consists of three acts itself (genius: The official Trailer tells you more than you could have known). The plot is told from different times and from different angles so that you never really know what is going on till the end. This doesn't necessarily mean that this is good way to tell a story, but Christopher Nolan has perfected this way of telling a plot since Memento. There will be times when you will think that you know exactly what is going on or you know what this movie is about but believe me: You don't. I don't want to spoil anything but if you like any sort of medium that really challenges your mind, you need to do yourself the favor and watch this movie. 'ABRACADABRA!'",10,0,1,28 May 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Surpassed my expectations
","If you plan on watching a X-Men movie you expect some cool and latest-technology special effects, some great combat scenes in which mutants with crazy powers use whatever ability they're feeling like and of course some cold-blooded drama that sometimes is based on some real issues society faces (more often the movies ask 'How society treats minorities'). X-Men 'Days of Future Past' has it all .... and so much more! Almost every line spoken is excellent and deeply important and the team of actresses and actors is absolutely stunning. I can't remember the last time I've seen a movie in which every actor/actress does their absolute best to achieve entertainment on such heights. If I'd want to find a fault in this movie it'd just be how the ending is so big of a plot-twist (which can be foreseen right from the start) that it greatly influences every single X-Men movie you have seen so far. If you like X-Men, you'll love 'Days of Future Past'.",9,6,10,9 June 2014
Up," Maybe the best PIXAR movie to-date?!
","Although I have to admit that besides all my concerns at first, PIXAR movies tend to be the most amusing and lovable movies out there. Before I've seen this movie I've been only interested in thrillers, horror-blockbusters and action-movies. Since I've seen UP, I'm checking out every PIXAR production right in a movie theater nearby. Why? I was wrong! I was wrong about this cover, this house, this old man - EVERYTHING! I don't wanna spoil the fun watching this movie yourself but I dare you to: If you want to do your soul something good, you need to check this out. You will laugh, you will cry and you will feel with the protagonists - during the first 10 freaking minutes of the movie! Until the credits rolled - and I admit it like a bos.. ehm man - I cried. The connection between every single character (not as if there are too many) and yourself is astonishing. PIXAR? You did it, man!",10,1,3,27 May 2012
The Conjuring," What is everyone so convinced about?!
","I watched this movie yesterday and it started like any other horror movie in recent years 'after a true story', in an old house, unfortunate family and so on. I liked the camera, the angles and the acting of the younger crew but the script wasn't just boring, it was 'ordinary'. There was absolutely no way you couldn't count down to 3 and expect some shock moment. If I'd have to be honest I wouldn't have dragged all my friends to come see this movie with me. Worst of all, the underlying Christian propaganda message was so obviously strong that I couldn't help but chuckle a little bit. Overall this movie was pretty forgettable .... really sad.",5,27,54,21 September 2013
Taken 2," Not that good - but not that bad either
","I hate when reading through reviews it seems as if for most of the people there is nothing between super-good or super-bad. Everyone calling this the worst movie of any year clearly doesn't have any idea what a really bad film looks like. Is the movie a money-grab? Propably. Does it have a really good script? No. Is the script terrible? Of course not. Is the acting bad? No way! It's just not as good as the 'innovative' (as far as a movie can be innovative nowadays) stuff shown in Taken. You get more or less the same basic characters and protagonists and the antagonists seek revenge this time instead of just looking for girls to sell them for profit. While the action is - like in every blockbuster - as far from believable as it can get, Liam Neeson (as always) shows exactly what we expect him to do: God-like skill in making human lives miserable and killing everyone in his path. Never judge a movie on 1 star reviews, Taken 2 is just maybe not worth being bought on DVD which doesn't make it a bad movie. Watch it once if you can see it on TV, that's all.",6,0,0,21 May 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Everyone I love gets a copy of this movie this Christmas!
","So here's the deal: This movie is more or less a really close look on how 'Mary Poppins' went from being a book to being in theaters around the world. While you may won't like this film if you expected something 'shocking', you'll see that this may be one of the most emotion-filled/ best written movies since 'The King's Speech' - with much better music. Beware of the fact, that this movie deals with some heavy topic (such as alcoholism and shattered expectations on life). I really recommend watching the original 'Mary Poppins' before 'Saving Mr. Banks' since this filmy heavily refers to scenes from P. L. Traver's/Disney's masterpiece. Expect some really heavy scenes, some good laughter and one of the best soundtracks you have heard in any movie in a long long time.",10,0,4,17 December 2014
Pitch Perfect," This movie represents everything that is wrong in modern media
","I at least give this movie credit for trying and of course producer want money so there is nothing wrong in giving the viewers what they crave for: Really cheesy love-stories, arrogant bad-boys and girls that behave like they can't decide whether they wanna be rude or just girlish. And that's the core: Most of the people in this movie are just RUDE. If you laugh at the opening vomit-scene there is no doubt you will love the rest of this movie but gosh was that scene in bad taste!Worst part is: The sining is not half-bad! It's the dialogue that drags it down and these chlich√© group of teenagers whose try desperately to be 'special' (which is good) and then fall in the same trap most other modern teenage movies like StepUp3D do.After so many anabolic-muscles and girlish overacting girls it's just black magic to me that no one seems to question this film's message.",3,21,39,14 September 2013
