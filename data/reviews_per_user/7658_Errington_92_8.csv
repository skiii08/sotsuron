Scarface," Tony Montana – The American Dream Corrupted
","Brain De Palma's version of Scarface shares the same views of greed and the shallow lifestyle its protagonist leads like its 1932 predecessor. Yet whereas the predecessor was a flat out call for the end of Gangster menace in America, this version focuses more on a distorted view of the American dream. The opening credits consist of a montage of Cuban refugees heading for America. The most important moment in this montage is a Father pointing out the American flag to his son showing the ideal of the American dream, wishing for a better life. Tony Montana, another Cuban refugee distorts the American dream by stating he 'didn't come here to break my back' and wants all the luxuries he can get through corrupt means along a route of greed and excess. Over the years Tony Montana has become a cult figure to some in the Hip – Hop community who see his rise from poverty as inspiring. However those people seem to be blind to the fact that Scarface is in no way glorifying Tony Montana or his actions. Being naturally ambitious Tony makes himself known through a drug deal which is unforgettable for its graphic nature. Tony and his unfortunate friend are doubled crossed resulting in his friend being cut to pieces via a chainsaw. What follows is a gory bloodbath where nothing but a mess of decay is left. This can easily be seen by some as excessive violence with no meaning but to entertain yet it is an early shocking realisation at the life Tony is leading, which has no real worth and no one succeeds for long. Tony is oblivious to this and is seduced by what such actions can reward him. He soon becomes surrounded by an environment where state of the art designs flourish in the homes of his associates and the motif of overly produced pop songs playing at Tony's regular night spot are as superficial as the people Tony engages with. To the casual viewer this may seem like tacky 80s styles but the more engaged viewer will realise the emptiness of this so called glamour and style. This emptiness coincides with Tony's growing possessive and covetous nature. Once working with the big boys Tony cannot help himself. Stealing away his bosses' woman along with taking down the boss himself shows the carelessness nature of the drug business along with the grim nature of Tony's American dream, rising to the top in a string of violent acts.The sub plot of Tony's sister Gina gives an insight into his possessive nature which later plays a part in his downfall. The motif of the eerie electronic score and the extreme close ups on Tony's eyes watching Gina in a provocative manner shows how extremely possessive he can be attempting to control everyone and everything with force. Indirectly he corrupts Gina into his insignificant lifestyle leading to a great dramatic confrontation where his Mother tells Tony that he is no good and puts to shame hard working Cubans, bringing back into focus Tony's distortion of the American dream. The general nature of Tony Montana evidently brings him down along with those around him. His drug addiction, the elaborate yet materialistic mansion, stylish objects and destructive behaviour all contribute to his decline yet the decisive moment was Tony ironically acting out for a morally good purpose. After Tony gains a moral conscience and derails an assassination attempt in order to protect a woman and her children, some don't share Tony's moral perspective showing once more the ruthless nature of the drug business. This results in the famous climax where Tony is given a horrific death with the ironic neon sign 'The World Is Yours' being shown as a reminder that it never really was. He may have had wealth and ambition but in truth Tony was living on a dangerous edge where his surroundings only thinly paved the reality of his destructive nature and the unsteady world he created for himself, the American dream corrupted.",Null,0,2,30 June 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Typical Storyline Vainly Masqueraded With Animation
","A trendsetter when originally released, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? contains a mixture of live action/animation which holds a legacy of starting the renaissance of feature length animations. For those of a certain age who may associate Who Framed Roger Rabbit? with their childhoods it must have been one of wonder and originality, but that's only speculation on my part. Not being born until the early 90s I was widely exposed the surge of Pixar and Disney animations through out my childhood. This is one way of explaining why my spectatorship of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was at times indifferent.A reason regarding my indifference is reflected in the storyline. Detective Eddie Valiant is hired by Cartoon Studio owner R.K. Maroon on a routine investigation on behalf of Roger Rabbit, yet true to form the case is not so cut and dried as Valiant is forced into a scenario of murder and corruption. It's a plot which is been recycled dozens of times before and since creating no suspense to the Noir/Crime influenced narrative.Even the characterisations rely on stale stereotypes with Valiant being the alcohol – addicted and emotionally conflicted private eye and in a lesser role, his suffering on/off girlfriend Dolores who desperately longs for reclaiming Valiant's affection. Considering the personalities of the characters and the storyline can be compared to a range of films, it becomes difficult to appreciate its worth specifically in terms of the overall story. Part of this also relies on the acting, which only Christopher Lloyd gave a standout performance as Judge Doom with deadly determination and evil demeanour conveying himself as a horrific antagonist.Who Framed Roger Rabbit? seemed overly relevant on its animated characters to steer towards a fresh direction when no significance was being applied to the live action. Though it is very harsh to criticise its crippling reliance on animation since it was intended to be a large part in the film's character, it did give Who Framed Roger Rabbit? an enhanced quality, which is an advantage. In a car chase sequence where Valiant and Roger Rabbit use an animated talking car to escape, zig zagging through traffic and pulling off impressive stunts, most notably extending in height to finally evade the villainous Toon police. Having the animation did give an extra dynamic to the action and helped create the surreal atmosphere where humans and cartoons co – existed. Also in brief the inclusion of Jennifer Rabbit as a sultry woman whose animated presence I saw as a cherished tribute to the notable females of film noir.On the flip side of what was stated earlier regarding the typical plot devices and stereotypes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, it was clever in attracting an older audience in building up certain expectations only to be humorously surprised. The pinnacle of this subversive humour was watching Valiant from a distance taking pictures of his suspects as part of an investigation with distant mutters of 'pattycake' and enthusiastic shouts of enjoyment hinting at a sexual encounter, only for older spectators to have this idea turned on its head when it's revealed the children's game of pattycake was being played. The magnitude of sexual innuendo within Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is both great humour and shockingly risqué for children's film by today's standards.In spite of its lacking originality in plot and characters, the ambitious scale of animation and its various uses to distorting perceived reality to create a surreal universe amongst an unoriginal narrative can still be appreciated to an extent.",Null,0,1,2 January 2013
World War Z," Zombie Feature That's 'Out Of Left-Field'
","Relentlessly unforgiving in its heart pounding action, unnerving our senses by delving into the unknown, keeping us fearful in suspense. World War Z is a climatic testament to the thriller genre and considering its contextual layout should be highly praised.The Lane family conduct their day as being status quo. Suddenly this breaks down when mass panic erupts around them. Having to follow instinct, Gerry (Brad Pitt) protects his family by fanatically manoeuvring through the streets of a now-plagued Philadelphia. Clearly in cinematic terms one can imagine the frantic technical style. A soundtrack to make your heart race, hectic cinematography and flashing edits. World War Z as a thriller lives to the genre's requirements. Marc Forster's direction lets World War Z suspense audiences in the dark before leaping out to unnerve. Every scene contained itself to the standards expected. The enigmatic score of Marco Beltrami captivated every tingling of my senses when Gerry was against deadly odds. The Zombies, in close quarters, were greatly effective. Kudos to Alex Reynolds (Choreographer) and Katalin Baranyi ('Zombie Coordinator', according to IMDb) for concocting genuinely frightening nemeses. Although these micro elements bring out the fear, World War Z never shifts aside the human factor. The action never overcomes the instincts Gerry, his Wife and Daughters experience. I could acknowledge all their emotions as they found themselves in a catastrophic situation. Here lies my contextual admiration for World War Z. It applies Zombie generics without indulging into blood and guts visuals. Rather we see the human condition in a raw form. Mireille Enos as Gerry's Wife simply wanting her Husband's safety makes for numerous moments of heartfelt anguish, the same can be said for his Daughters. Particularly Constance (Sterling Jerins) whose innocence emphasised the frailty of humanity, the transcendent fear shared by all. World War Z blends horrifying thrills with heartfelt concern for the Lanes in their plight. These are qualities I normally don't find in multi-million blockbusters.",Null,1,2,11 July 2013
Cloverfield," I Don't Know Why It's Happening.....
","'I don't know why it's happening'. In hindsight this quote is a potent embodiment of Cloverfield, its raw emotive core which sees its central characters be driven by their emotions through thick and thin in a night which forever changes the course of history.Starting off in an ordinary fashion we witness the trials and tribulations of Robert as he prepares to bid farewell to friends, family and his true love Beth. Although this sequence is nothing spectacular and could easily fit into a sappy rom – com, it has an underlying sense of dread and lingering at the events to come. Seeing this love drama unfold forms a humanity which makes them relatable to us which was exactly the move Cloverfield had to make before hitting us forthright with the traumatic horror that ensues. The major player here is the cinematography, its point of view vision which we're confined to so that we become immersed into the devastating chaos that the survivors finds themselves in. Being restricted to a point of view vision means there's no escape for us, we're not in control of what we see forcing us into the horrific psychological ride which consumes every character a la The Blair Witch Project. Cloverfield defiantly would not have fully realised its havoc - filled atmosphere and tension if the cinematography had expanded. Cloverfield's cinematography is only a percentage of the immense psychological roller-coaster we venture on. Shock deaths, immediate changes to situations and honest accounts of individual feelings, Cloverfield does not shy away from raw emotion. In watching Robert having to tell his Mother of his younger brother's death is a culmination, his whole emotional barrier crumbling down at the stark realisation of his world being devastatingly altered hits us simultaneously.Credit also has to be given to Cloverfield's familiar urban New York setting, the hustle and bustle of modern life suddenly hauled to a standstill where everything the characters come across causes us to feel overwhelmed with senses of profound astonishment. Particularly when the surviving members of the group randomly come across a white horse and cart causally making its own way across now deserted streets, only in such a stunning journey of pandemonium and brutal violence would witnessing a white horse and cart become a disturbing absurdity. This along with the mystery surrounding the invading monster only serves up more horrifyingly astonished scenes. Running up to only the seventy minute mark, Cloverfield uses its short time frame perfectly with terrifying tension and jittering suspense playing with us psychologically constantly making us wonder, why is it all happening?",Null,1,2,12 February 2013
The Dark Knight," Batman Rightly Is The Dark Knight
","Immensely entertaining and thought provoking The Dark Knight doesn't come across as the typical blockbuster. Beyond the combat scenes and extensive action sequences The Dark Knight explores deeply the themes of morality and corruption via the actions of the characters which I found greatly intriguing.At the core of the narrative is the conflict between Batman and the Joker in which they trade blows and mind games go amuck. The conflict is mostly intensified by the brilliant performance given by Heath Leger whose demeanour is one of cool indifference of his actions and the flamboyantly creepy tone in his voice, his persona horrifies as much as it fascinates. Yet despite his disturbed personality he rightly highlights the status of Batman as an outsider. 'To them you're just a freak like me', resulting in violent outburst from Batman which is connected to his inner vulnerability in terms of his feelings regarding his own persona.Bruce Wanye's persona as Batman not only raises questions from himself about how far he goes but also makes others question his actions. Some begin to blame Batman for the troubles in Gotham throughout The Dark Knight seeing him as selfish and a vigilante. It is a recurring element which makes the audience question Batman's methods, is he truly a hero or a man who follows his own rules no matter the cost? Yet The Dark Knight turns this question upon ourselves when citizens and convicts are given the choice to kill the other to save themselves. Surely we were all thinking thoughts others may deem to be selfish. Therefore was Batman as selfish as anyone else in Gotham? The Dark Knight achieves intellectual satisfaction in making us ponder such elements.This theme continues as it intertwines with corruption taken on by Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent. Both are honourable men in a corrupt city going to great lengths to fight organised crime. However it comes at a price with Harvey Dent becoming Two Face in the process of playing a part of the indecent world he wished to destroy and Gordon having to reluctantly betray his morals to mislead Gotham into a lie. The Dark Knight again confronts us with the morality within ones actions as if to comment that the world is not completely black and white.Although these themes play a major role in The Dark Knight it also has room for lighter elements such as romance, where Wayne and Dent aim for the affections of Rachel in scenes providing nothing more than a brief relief from the seriousness of The Dark Knight's main theme. The combat sequences are choreographed well and convey realism within each movement which enables such sequences to be more fulfilling for the audience as it draws us in rather than being amused by a staged quality which sometimes plagues other films of similar stature or even previous Batman films, with Tim Burton's installments coming to mind. The cinematography and editing are also vital in drawing the audience in with its fast cutting and pace enthralling us particularly in the opening sequences where the Joker's robbery and Batman's latest intervention are juxapostioned getting the audience ready for what lied ahead.It may have been a blockbuster in 2008 but The Dark Knight conjures much more than intense combat and large explosions. It leaves an afterthought of the consequences of being a hero as Batman/Bruce Wayne is a conflicted individual whose sense of humanity ironically sets his fall from grace by the closing moments setting the stage for the fallout in the equally provoking sequel The Dark Knight Rises. It gives The Dark Knight a human quality to its heroic protagonist which can be missing from other superhero films.",Null,0,4,21 August 2012
The Artist," A Love Letter To The Silent Years
","If you judge The Artist on its plot alone, the film does not seem special. An established actor and a newcomer meet slowly building up to a love story while each other's careers go in opposite directions. Sounds pretty cliché but The Artist is not the typical movie. It is a self – described love letter to cinema mixing different genres together to celebrate the movies rather than presenting itself as a movie.The mixture of genres play a large part in The Artist. They are conveyed in a charming fashion which creates a sense of nostalgia for this period of cinema. From George and his dog Jack play acting on stage in a delightful manner, Peppy strutting her stuff in a brief musical dance number and Peppy later acting out her passion for George by improvising with his jacket in a tender moment. All these scenes combine different genres to show how cinema has made us laugh, love and cry. The Artist creates a blank canvas by having no language barrier in order for the audience to have strong embedded emotions. Yet it's the drama aspect of The Artist which plays the most vital role portraying George's downfall.When sound screen test begin to happen at the studio George laughs it off naive to cinema's evolution. Soon it begins to haunt George, scared for his career. Sat in his dressing room, George begins to hear the sounds of objects touching the surface, Jack barking and people outside yet George cannot hear his own voice. Moving around in a confused state captured in tinted camera angles dazed at the realisation of his future. Although it was only a dream, it is a nightmare reality for himself and for many others whose careers collapsed by the coming of sound. The Artist is not only a pleasant look at cinema's past but also a sobering reminder of the destruction Hollywood left behind in a number of lives.Although The Artist has its charm in its expressive love for silent cinema by using different genres, it does unfortunately start to drag. The years quickly go by as Peppy becomes a sensation while George sinks deeper into depression. All the while Peppy longs for him and watches George from a distance. Nothing much happens during this period of The Artist which flattens the viewing experience. It's only once George manages to break out of his depression and reunite with Peppy that The Artist picks back up with a blend of romance, melodrama and a happy climax.The experience The Artist gives us is not only a mostly alluring storyline but a musical score which to perfection embodies all the emotions The Artist contains creating it a tremendous inner feeling for a spectator. It brilliantly inhabits the shifting mood of The Artist as well as personifying the multiple genres. From the light hearted tone of George and Peppy unexpectedly meeting to the fast and forceful tone of George destroying his film reels, the musical score draws us into the core of the story.Despite The Artist somewhat lingering in its storyline it does not dent its tribute to the early years of cinema which is its most important aspect. It lets those who may have never experienced silent cinema appreciate its great dramatic and atmospheric qualities where everyone can feel and understand the characters emotions without a language barrier. In this sense The Artist flatters and should rightly be remembered as a loving tribute to cinema.",Null,2,4,27 June 2012
Paths of Glory," The Gulf of Humanity
","Although less than 90 minutes in length, Paths of Glory has a great amount of depth in the scenario it presents. A critical anti – war perspective on how formal war can be and how it distances itself from humanity.Their lavish surroundings immediately showing the gap between themselves and their troops, Generals Broulard and Mireau hatch a plan to overtake the Ant Hill. Yet even though they are fully aware that they do not have enough troops to overtake the Ant Hill successfully they simply push on with the plan. This shows no respect for their troops resulting in a complete disaster. This scene establishes the direction of George Macready and Adolphe Menjou performances, playing men so stubborn in their ethics that they are excellent within the narrative as the aloof villains.Lead by Col Dax, the troops try but fail to complete their mission. Again the gap between authority and their troops is conveyed. Whilst the camera makes memorable tracking shots of Dax and the troops advancing against bullets and shellfire, Mireau and his colleagues watch the fighting from a safe distance. It is oblivious who the sympathy lies with here, the fighting is shown through close tracking shots and close ups of the soldiers in no man's land whilst Mireau in a distant long shot orders his own troops to be shelled for not advancing ignorance to their plight. The abuse of power does not stop there.Unwilling to listen to reason he along with Broulard agree to hold a trail to judge three chosen soldiers. This leads to a trail which can only be described as a masquerade as there is already a predetermined outcome. It is from this point on where the levels of humanity are severely contrasted. Dax removes himself from the coldness of authority. Not only does he offer himself to be shot for being the commanding officer for the ill fated mission but then decides he will defend the three men showing his loyalty and heartfelt sympathy to his troops unlike Broulard and Mireau.This is where Kirk Douglas' performance becomes its most passionate. A man willing to defend the accused making his presence felt using the tone of his voice to get across his character's standpoint on the issue most memorably stating 'I am ashamed to be a member of the human race and this is one such occasion' stressing the contrast of the court's humanity. However Dax's efforts are in vain as the soldiers were not given a fair trial and are sentenced to death. Not only are we shown the injustice of their execution through the completion of the act but also the hopelessness the condemned soldiers feel. Cpl Paris compares himself to a cockroach stating it will live through tomorrow while he will not. Even later in their final moments they are not given dignity, with one of the condemned executed whilst injured and confined to a stretcher. It puts the situation in context of Paths of Glory's humanist theme.Even at Paths of Glory's finale a dim view of humanity continues to be shown even at the sight of hope. Dax, feeling defeated and angry by his hierarchy, watches the troops in a moving final scene. Listening to the beauty of a young woman's voice begins to let out the emotions of the troops. A montage of the troops still faced with tears welling in their eyes. It shows us not only that these troops underneath their exteriors are human but it becomes a piece of tragedy at the thought of these men dying because of people like Broulard and Mireau's take on humanity is futile. 'Give them a few more minutes', Dax states knowing what Broulard and Mireau failed to realise in terms of the troops humanity as well as the somber knowledge of the inhumanity which will continue to rule the reins.Paths of Glory sums up the stains trusted on humanity and its devastating effects. How the ones who do not appreciate its core cause recklessness are ironically in power to preserve their countries civilisation.",Null,0,1,2 June 2012
Saboteur," The Peaks of Suspense, Paranoia and Propaganda
","The credits begin; a silhouette approaches closer to the forefront as the music heightens in intensity. Is it a red herring or something more? We are given this conundrum whilst thrust into a world of suspense and paranoia where things are not as they seem. This is where Saboteur begins to weave a web of suspicion to play with its audience. Protagonist Barry's journey of suspense and paranoia begins when his colleague is killed as a result of a fire extinguisher filled with gasoline is used as a form of sabotage planned by disguised Nazis. Suspicion falls on Barry forcing him on the run to seek out the truth, becoming America's most wanted man while attempting to gain the trust of others. Saboteur makes clever use of micro techniques in which keeps the audience edgy as the experience of paranoia and fears of the characters are conveyed. A rattling fire extinguisher evoking painful memories for Barry, who stares bleakly into the camera to gain the attention of the audience and the motif of the billboards which contain coincidental messages such as 'You're Being Followed'. This all helps fuel Barry's paranoia which in turn manipulates on the mind of the audience. The further Barry entangles himself in his quest for the truth the more intensifying the atmosphere gets. Unconvinced of his innocence Patricia holds Barry hostage till she can report him to the authorities. She stops by the roadside to seek help; Barry takes this opportunity to break free from his handcuffs. Using the fan belt within the engine, the dramatic score begins to heighten in volume and the editing works its magic with multiple jump cuts between Patricia in the distance, Barry anxiously looking on and the close up of the handcuffs slowly breaking apart. The fast pace of this scene is the perfection of suspense in Saboteur creating a great dramatic scene with suspenseful touches. Although the suspense and paranoia is constant throughout Saboteur, the public consciousness concerning WWII is ever evident. This is personified through the attitude of Patricia, who at first refuses to believe Barry's innocence. She acts suspicious of his every move and even tells Barry he has the look of a saboteur. It all sounds ridiculous to today's audience knowing Barry's plight yet Patricia's notions show the hatred and distrust the American public had of anyone associated with enemy activity. This may even be a critique of such attitudes by Hitchcock as it is left to a group of misfits to remind the audience, more importantly the then American public about what they were all fighting for. Gaining a ride with a travelling circus Barry and Patricia are made to feel welcome except for one who the group differ with. Once they hear police sirens Barry confesses he is the person they are after. Instead of becoming hostile they decide wherever to hand him over by a vote based fairness, which one member states is the democracy the Allied forces are fighting for. The vote keeps Barry safe and in turn makes Patricia reflect on her mistrust for him. 'They made me so ashamed', she exclaims emotionally which may now come across as sentimental but at the time of Saboteur's release would have been a powerful reminder of what the public felt their troops were fighting for. It is not only in patriotic showings like this where America was reminded of the situation they faced; it was also through the seemingly innocent appearances of the villains which would have made for a more terrifying realisation. The villains in Saboteur disguise themselves within society. Charles Tobin is a respected ranch owner who spends his time relaxing in his pool playing with his granddaughter and Mrs Sutton, a wealthy woman who host charity galas at her home. They did not appear to be stereotypical villains making this aspect of Saboteur more frightening. Who can you trust? It was a dark and chilling reminder of the masquerading which took place during wartime. Saboteur works on two levels. Historically it highlights to those unfamiliar with the time the fear contained in the psyche of the general public concerning the enemy. While Saboteur today may not complete with the more sophisticated contemporary films on a technique level, it still has a style of its own both in micro and macro aspects which can be appreciated.",Null,0,0,23 May 2012
