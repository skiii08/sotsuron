Mission: Impossible III," Brits in Hollywood?? Alan Rickman yes, but the rest NO THANKS...
","Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent and you can even believe the action scenes when he kicks Tom Cruise around. I saw him a week before in In Cold Blood, but after 5 seconds I just saw the character, not the actor.With Tom Cruise you begin to see trademark mannerisms, and see the actor rather than the character, but you don't care because he has got star quality.BUT why is it that Simon Pegg just sticks out like a sore thumb? I just remembered zombies outside a pub every time he showed up on screen. One minute you are in Mission Impossible land and the next minute the illusion has gone and you are down The Winchester. It was like John Cleese popping up in a Bond film. 'What is HE doing here??' Maybe it is because I am a Brit and when I hear a solitary English accent in a crowd of Americans it really stands out. I used to think that it was a bit off that every time you heard an English accent you knew that Bruce Willis was going to sort them out. But not any more.Anyway,whether Simon Pegg did a great job or just reprised 'Oh God, what am I going to do now?', I wish Hollywood would keep to the stereotype of the familiar but slightly odd and so sinister Brits. Brits do Carry On films, bits and pieces for Channel 4 or get shot by Bruce. Anything else just does not work for me. I don't pay Â£8 to see the same old familiar faces, I want a bit of glamour and something different.AND PLEASE Don't even mention Thandie Newton in MI 2",6,1,2,5 May 2006
Downfall," Impressively realistic, and good colour.
","There were a lot of booms at the start of the movie - of the sound recording variety, which spoilt the otherwise incredible realism. There were also a lot of booms at the end, but the right sort that made the theatre shake.My only criticism is that in all the excerpts of Traudl Junge I have seen, she had a very kind voice which gave her an attractive character. Alexandra Maria Lara did a good job of looking lost, but the voice did not seem right. Gritty and realistic. At the end of the film you get a synopsis of what happened to all the characters, but they were not on screen long enough. I would have been happy to sit there for a few minutes longer.",9,1,5,5 April 2005
