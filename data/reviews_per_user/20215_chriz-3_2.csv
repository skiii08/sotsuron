Minority Report," Flawed by principle but entertaining
","Films relying on concepts like time travel or 'privisioning' of the feature mostly fail from the logical standpoint, simply by the paradoxs created. So is 'Minority Report'. Overseeing this, the story and the special effects are at least entertaining. The issues raised by the future presented (total supervision etc.) to the viewer also provide some grounds for intellectual engagement but being a mainstream release this parts remains kinda shallow.",7,0,0,13 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Solid work, but no Reason for a hype
","May contain spoilersOverall a well made film, especially if you like epics. You have to admit that in the first part 99% percent of the movie consist of concerned faces and CGI effects. The CGI is resonable good done while there are are some scenes where the quality could be better the blue screen lightning is often flawed. The final battle scenes are a relief, because after 2,5 hours seeing people looking concerned you finally getting to see some people with other expressions on their faces.Summing it all up: The film does not deserve the hype it has created but is a solid movie you should consider watching if you like epics.",5,0,0,20 December 2002
