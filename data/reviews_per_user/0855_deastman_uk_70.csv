The Lobster," the odd couple
","I've often felt recently that society is slowly pushing single men to the fringes. But this unusual art house stylised film, populated by actors who are usually very mainstream, takes that idea to the extreme. There are similarities with Being John Malkovich in sheer weirdness of the conceit, but there is also a strong feeling, mirrored by the jagged music that this is a film that wants to join the indie crowd, but wasn't born to it. This is made by someone who loves Jonze, Anderson, Gondry, Iñárritu etc - but like Gilliam hasn't quite mastered getting a great treatment to a strong draft.The problem first comes with the tone, which is played differently throughout the cast. Olivia Colman's Hotel Manager strikes an almost perfect absurdest humour, but then Ben Wishaw plays it almost totally straight. Farrell keeps to a low key with some nice notes of humour but doesn't really fill the screen. There are moments of embarrassing terror, and these leave the audience a bit perplexed next to lighter touches.And then the film just has pacing problems and feels longer than it should do. In some respects the film is easy to criticize because the ideas are so strong, but there just wasn't enough work put into it to complete the vision properly.",6,1,8,27 December 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Special K
","So Blade Runner gets a remake, the hero is called K (and indeed he is partly on Trial) and we still don't know or care whether Deckard is a replicant. But the journey is wonderful.Of Hollywood directors, I thought it was only Tarantino who believed that film making was more art than business. While all the narrative is in service to the story, the film has enough space to lets things unfold. (Yes, it is bloody long too)The first 10 minutes of Blade Runner 2049 are already better than most films I've seen from that last few years. It focuses on no more than a cooking pot. The cinematography throughout is stunning, but not in the hamfisted throw it at the screen way of the remake of Ghost In The Shell for example. The budget and the imagination are actually in sync with visions of vast desolate eco corrupted landscapes and cityscapes. It was a reach in the original, but in this film it is complete.I'm not actually a big fan of the original. It was far too stagy even with the bits of philosophy sewn into the action plot. One thing the remake manages well is not to keep digging into the original source for meaning. Where they do meet the remake comes off better. The signature Voight-Kampff test for instance has a truly unsettling equivalent. K's sexual relationship is embarrassingly modern, not noir romantic.The most pivotal scenes are all brief and between women (though they all fail the Bechdel test quite dramatically) and in fact the plot revolves around birth giving the film a kind of Children of Men vibe.The elan showed by the film is remarkable even for such a high profile remake. Everything has a heft and quality. The design is great. We get a few glimpses of other sci-fi hits (a lot of Matrix type scenes, a few Minority Report fixations) but all in service to something, not just a fancy trailer. The film drops hints, but then muddies them leaving quite a few things mysterious. Another film could follow, but there is no feeling of incompleteness to power a franchise.A remake is a remake, but this has enough about it to be a classic.",8,3,10,8 October 2017
Black Swan," Down the Swanny
","As an Arafonsky fan.. OK, it isn't that hard to be a fan as he has only a handful of excellent films to his credit.He is probably in the part of his career where he has to match personal projects (The Fountain) with money making stuff. Portman is probably at a similar place, and that maybe the best way to understand why this film was made. And the assembled cast is excellent on paper.The Black Swan falls down rather quickly. The depiction of the claustrophobic Jewish princess and mother starts well but departs usefulness rapidly. And between the clichés (dark reflections in subway etc) there are three part performances (her mum, director and rival) that don't quite mature. But that's because she is mad, and we need to see two sides to everyone at once. Because she's mad. Yeah? No. The camera is on Portman a lot, and that may be the problem. She is not allowed to evolve fully one way or another, and when she does change it is rushed.This film seems to be a backward move from Requim for a Dream, where we got to see vibrant threads of collapsing lives. With Nina, we just don't get a valid journey. Which leaves the film on a certain river.",5,7,13,31 January 2011
Frost_Nixon," Milhouse beyond the White House
","Its been sometime since I saw a film which completely works as a piece of cinema. More than just a few good performances, there is a direction and a story fully told. Basic elements maybe, but oddly missing in much output of the last year or so.One thing that made this film click was the realisation that power and success are circumstantial and not elements of fate. No conspiracy theory is needed here.We see Nixon, a president whose power was only vaguely contained by American law, on the crossroads between greatness and delusion. Nixon's lack of personal warmth was a disaster in the TV age - more so than his conditional morality.And we see the lightly talented David Frost succeed because he didn't appear to Nixon as a likely enemy. That Sheen plays Frost a little Blair like is probably no accident.The film keeps a respectful distance between the political elements. The liberals are seen as worthy, but blinkered - the right as smug but defencive. This allows the two protagonists space to fill the film. And from that flows the humour, tension and entertainment.",7,1,3,28 January 2009
Mission: Impossible III," Follow the white rabbits foot
","Given the amount of time and money given to make Lost, its no longer such a stretch for a TV director to make a multi million dollar film.Once the lightweight plot framework is in place, the film takes off. By the first twenty minutes, the film had already eclipsed its prequels. The action scenes make sense, the pace is unrelenting and its all very noisy. Hoffman is, of course, vile and Simon Pegg is, of course, geeky. In fact the action scenes carry real menace and not a little brutality.Cruise is his normal gnomic self. While anyone could carry out the hero role, Cruise does not offend. Like the Rabbits foot he is silly prop that you need to keep the film rolling. Roll on number 4.",6,0,1,7 May 2006
10 Cloverfield Lane," Ramona has flowered
","Not knowing anything about this film - and not having seen the film it is supposed to be related to - I was genuinely happy to see the girl Scott Pilgrim quite rightly battled for, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. John Goodman is also exceptional with the world collapsing in his grizzly fizog.In reality the true relation to this film is the other recent three hander, the much superior Ex Machina. That film kept you wondering till the end, whereas 10 Cloverfield Lane felt like a roll your own adventure, a Frankenstein's monster made of parts you have seen elsewhere. The film satisfies at the time, but holds no memories.Suffice to say it is a thriller that is both fresh and in no part original.",6,0,4,23 March 2016
The Equalizer," Equal to nothing
","This had the magic combination of unpleasant violence without relevance. There was absolutely nothing original. Zero. That's unusual. It wasn't a star vehicle for anybody. Denzel could not decide whether he was Charles Bronson or Steven Segal. He settled for Forest Gump. Perhaps Hit Girl could have done better too.The film could have been almost 30 minutes shorter, but insisted on nonsense exposition of the revenge type. But every aspect of this type of film has been bettered elsewhere.I'd be surprised if the Russian community don't complain. Every Russian with a line (or grunt) was a dumb psycho.Please just ignore this pile of shite.",4,13,26,14 October 2014
Skyfall," The Dark Knight Returns
","Before and during the 'reboot', the problem with the franchise was the number of close competitors. It actually started with 'xXx', but continued more obviously with Jason Bourne, Batman, Mission Impossible and to some extent even with the recent Judge Dredd. The solo hero, not well understood, effectively battling himself or versions of himself.Sam Mendes had every reason to admire Christopher Nolan, and what he did with the excellent Batman movies. The problem with Skyfall is that Mendes has come to Bond as a viewer, maybe a fan, but not a director. He has produced a modern action film that takes elements of what he likes, but has utterly failed to churn out a Bond film.It was rather strangely paced, and we know it was 'fucked' by the writers strike, but Quantum of Solace was every inch 007. The very euro chic of an opera used as a backdrop to a perverted auction, the henchmen having just as much character as the villain, Bond following leads with varying success etc. And the presence of a fallen woman who isn't trying to be his mother.Skyfall had all the elements in position at the start, but started to trade them away for gems from other films. A villain who thought he was the Joker, and in an Avengers plot. Hacking shenanigans from Die Hard, an ending from Home Alone. Even the classic pay off from someone using Dredd's Lawgiver. The various plot holes which have been very well aired elsewhere were ultimately a product of losing focus because of so much borrowing. Mendes needs to stop being a fan, and become a director again. Apart from the lazy one note performance from Naomie Harris, there is no reason to assume Mendes cannot use his undoubted skills to work on a piece that fulfils the genre as well as innovates where it is required.",6,6,15,3 November 2012
Gravity," Space 1999
","The limited talents of the Hollywood stars fit perfectly into this minimally plotted survival film. And if there has been a more faithful depiction of space, I haven't seen it. The little saccharin, needed for this otherwise austere show to be swallowed by a studio executive, is quite forgivable. Along with Avatar, this film knows why it is using 3D. It allows the eye to pick out details (like a coming astronaut) without camera tricks.One of the attractions is one and a half hours of simplicity. In the current film world of back stories, jump cuts, twists, side plots, non linearity etc, I have to admit this makes a welcome break. In many ways this film is a throwback to previous decades. Within the bounds of what this film offers, it delivers everything with aplomb. With so little to distract from the survival plot, you could argue that the film has few ways to fall of the rails. But it is up to the director to select his target and execute against it.",8,1,3,23 November 2013
Star Trek," Plot fails to reach escape velocity
","When I first heard Sylar would become Spock, I was already keen to see this movie. And it is indeed a very sticky bit of popcorn - a tasty snack with no food value at all.One of the strange beauties of this film is that it will certainly fail as a DVD seller because the plot is execrable. As an entertainment device, it holds up for an hour or so - but it could not possibly survive multiple viewings. Quite an inversion from the norm.Most science fiction is a crucible for social politics, and this alternate Star Trek fares well here. Beyond the great visuals and jaunty dialogue, selected characters have a vague inner life and back story. The original Trek cannon is adhered to on occasion, and this provides some backbone though by the end of the film even Salman Rushdie would be seeking less magic realism.Due to the pure entertainment value the film delivers, this will probably spawn a franchise - but only if the plot is not taken from scrawlings on the lavatory at Walmart.",6,6,10,18 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Legendary Strudel
","Tarantino is getting more like Mozart - technically brilliant if not quite emotionally mature.But within minutes you remember that great films derive emotion from the élan of the director. The first chapter of this film can be put besides the opening of Once Upon a Time in the West for bravado film making. Its just two men in a hut, one drinking milk.We get those cardboard cut out characters of WWII blown up to stunning Technicolour 3D. So much better than Kill Bill, which gave nothing back to the genre it kidnapped.There has been a lot of osmosis between Tarantino and other artsy directors. Almondovar and Allen seem also to use those detailed digressions and physical incongruities in otherwise well structured films. Yes, Tarantino steals of course but others take note too.Basterds is pulp, a bit left field and very well made all at once. And again, it appears the director has probably made a new career for a forgotten actor. And a apple desserts.",7,1,8,26 August 2009
Captain Marvel," As much as it is ever worth reviewing Marvel films, this is perfectly fine
","While it could be a Thor film, a Captain America film, or in fact any origin film, this one inherits the speed and flash of the better marvel films, and retains a workable dialogue.Unlike Black Panther, we never follow a posse; all the characters are allowed their own motives. The pace moves quickly when necessary, and slows down while the little plot exposition needed passes. There are generally few characters in any one shot, which gives the film a little more space.Unusually, all the performances are good, even the cat. Samuel L is his normal self (minus 30 years) and Brie Larson isn't so much plucky (which is actually what was probably intended) as cool. Using the cue that the Captain America films are supposed to be edgy, this one stuck to action and space - only getting a few emotional issues to keep it going. And yes the soundtrack sparkled.",6,1,3,14 March 2019
Oldboy," Keeping it in the family
","The family does seem to be a focus in Asian cinema, and this is no exception. Being imprisoned in a room for 15 years for no immediate reason is a very good start to an exceptional film. But the closeness of the interiors does not seem to stop once our hero is released to get his revenge.The violence in the film while never meaningless does seem to weave a strong unpleasant backbone that gives the film its vivid consistency. But its not a logic - its never an and in itself. While there is a lot borrowed from the modern stylised thriller, which always involves some sort of identity problem, e.g. Seven, Fight club, Momento etc, the film is much more than the sum of its parts. The director has a sense of timing that can only come about from the strength of the written material.But ultimately this is still Asian cinema, with Asian values, yet its fighting for Western cinema audiences. It will be interesting to see which culture makes way first.",7,10,73,18 December 2004
Spider-Man 2," The format works
","While this is not a movie to remember for all time, and it isn't even the best super hero movie (X2, despite the tired plot is still better) this is the first comic conversion that actually fully works on screen. Every aspect of the film that matters is done well. The characters are still paper thin but I do care about them. The story is allowed to work at its own pace without being hijacked by the pixel fiddlers.
 The humour is not soulless one liners but small moments or fun riffs. Doc Oc using his arms to do four things at once while lighting a cigar, a terrible musical rendition of the old theme tune, and guess what colour bow tie the next green goblin wears? The action scenes are the most effective I have seen since Return of the King (which effectively defined year zero for effects based films). This is partly because they have been done properly, but also because they are done at different tempos. From Doc Ocs harrowing escape from the hospital, to bullet time reflex carnage, to silly pranks at the bank. Like Judge Dredd before it, Spidey has his mask off a little too often for comic fans - but in a film very much about identity, we know this is hollywood trying its best to entertain, and mainly succeeding.",6,0,1,12 August 2004
Terminator Salvation," I probably won't be back
","I could spend ages reeling off all the aftermath / post apocalypse films that Hollywood has produced in the last twenty years. This Terminator takes from many of them. The action sequences were magnificent. The characters, insubstantial. The plot, a hindrance. And there, the review would end.And yet T1 and especially T2 did so much to innovate action movies. The scenes and dialogue still gently wash around my head today. The idioms of the robot assassin entered our culture.Terminator Salvation seems to believe its true parents were Matrix, I am Legend and War of the Worlds. Much has been made of Bale, and he is part of the films bastardisation. But there is no question the director has committed the patricide.This film stands on its own as a reasonable addition to post apocalypse franchise, but not as a Terminator.",6,1,3,25 June 2009
Deadpool 2," I believe X will give it to you, again
","I was expecting less, and pleasantly surprised that it over delivered. In the first outing, when the jokes were stripped away there wasn't a whole lot happening. This time, there is a greater belief backing the picture - probably because this time Deadpool and crew more tightly inhabits the MCU. The new characters are all well fleshed out, Cable is a great foil, Domino a great sidekick and the action is not second rate. In fact the action was very solid. Cable kicks ass in a non derivative way - he is clearly a soldier. The emotional story is played reasonably straight - another sign of confidence. It doesn't hang off the film, but is integral to it. The plot is strangely lacking in the usual jar load of massive holes - even given the time travel. This just all gives the humour even more space to stand. (For me, Weasel gets top billing)I'm happy to give a film, however lowbrow, an appropriate score if it delivers on it's premise. But there is an issue here: this film burns it's own genre for heat. The X-men are thrown onto the fire right in front of our eyes. With Thor: Ragnorak also played for laughs, there will be a more stratified feel to future Marvel. There is room for funny, or political, or world stretching. But falling between these stools will no longer work.",7,4,7,31 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," The franchise dies on the editing floor
","The last time I was in a film in which the audience just burst out laughing in an emotionally dramatic scene was the dreadful Attack of the Clones. But as Green Goblin junior spent some quality screen time crying with his mates, one laugh in the audience started a chain reaction of unstoppable mirth.I'm actually going to blame Alfred Molina. He provided such a good counterpoint in the last film - a non camp baddie - that the job was too hard for the scriptwriters this time. Hayden Church had a weak script, one expression, and no back story. I think the final film was a desperate attempt to cut what remained into a film but it failed.So see this film from the view point of the editing team. There is one and half hours of good film, there is plenty of good CGI action. There is some good humour, but everything else is lacking. So by putting in as much as possible, you get to make good previews. So the film stinks? People will see it anyway, and number 4 is coming - ready or not.But I think the franchise is clearly in trouble. The Silver Surfer looks cool, and Batman has returned. The third X-men attempt now looks kind of good. Odds are that Rami will jump ship, or maybe two franchises will merge. I think the web flinger will live on, but this kind of disaster surely won't be repeated.",5,5,10,6 May 2007
The Hateful Eight," Hat trick
","When we first see Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds, the lengthy Alpine scene is a joy - but also reminds you how little real adult cinema there is. And without Tarantino, the Disneyfication of mainstream film would not stop.This time, he takes his usual patience to build up the Western but it is immediately apparent that film is also puzzle, maybe whodunnit. So from the outset we are expecting the plot to resolve surprisingly, and it does. If you are familiar with Tarantino, then this film delivers in spades, but it has surprisingly even less concessions to a modern cinema audience than his previous two films.The film is both slow and yet Beat Takeshi like in its outbursts of violence. The film is long, and does not truly kick in for an hour. The use of the N-word is excessive and purely for texture which is what gets Tarantino into so much hot water.But Tarantino has a discipline that keeps the film incredibly tight, which keeps you fully emerged in his world, reminding you that good filmmakers use the time they have effectively.",7,0,5,22 January 2016
Molly's Game," Did you know the centre of the universe smells of elderberries?
","When a story needs to be told, Hollywood is the place to go. And this story is bold and resilient. It has a bravura ending. But despite the solid cast and the presence of Sorkin, this film seemed to have clear quality gaps, with the occasional feeling of an 80's TV movie.Chastain was superb throughout, although often shot as if the director really wanted Julia Roberts. She plays the sharp hostess, the sympathetic ear and the foil to the boys with money. And yet the script often just fails her. Intelligence is often reduced to stupid wikipedia quotes, and the indie style sidetracking didn't really work. At one point she almost said 'I know Kung Fu'Idris Elba finally gets his first serious role for ages, and the film's clinching speech, but he has a couple of scenes which simply needed to be reshot. He doesn't yet display the timing needed for light comedy or the touch for those early two way sizing up parts.The photography was surprisingly poor; combined with indifferent post processing that made it look inferior to most Netflix productions. If you have sports shots, you need sport photography - which was evidently missing. They used some of the classic 'bag of money' shots, and the god life going out of control fast sequences, but there were many energy sapping loose scenes between. Much of the set design was oddly second rate. I don't understand why this should be. Some of the scenes just lacked chemistry; Chastain doesn't always work well with others. This sometimes reflected Molly Blooms slightly fish out of water naivety, but sometimes not.All in all this was an entertaining piece, with some fun bit parts, that just should have been treated better.",6,2,5,7 January 2018
The Town," More Heat than lite
","The point of heist movies is that they are pretty much the same. From the Aussie gem Money Movers to the classic Heat, it is another way to view the relationship between man, woman and money.The Town - following on from The Wire - bases itself in a single urban area. We are introduced to its bad denizens. Affleck is vaguely convincing - in parts - as a lowlife criminal. Well, he isn't truly with it but he doesn't actually do harm.Rebecca Hall performance as the innocent moll is a bit strong, but like Affleck she is watchable.Yes, this tears off a great deal from Heat - but that is no bad thing. Heat could be remade every two years and I'd probably see it all the time. The Town is predictable but well put together, which makes you wonder what genre Affleck wants to try his hand at next.",6,4,9,8 October 2010
Lost in Translation," Transient
","A simple portrait of two people with little focus in their lives sharing a few moments with each other in Tokyo. When you leave the cinema, you quickly realise that the film has no backbone or message of any kind - either from the writing or direction. This is cinema at its most transient; with good cinematography but few persistent images, absorbing dialogue but no characters, form but no structure.",6,0,1,17 January 2004
Doctor Strange," Stranger Things
","Commonsense will tell you that this Marvel material is beyond any sensible retelling, as there is not enough acid to go around. So relax and enjoy the ride.The plot and screenplay are totally built by the numbers, so you will feel as if you have seen the film many many times before. It shares with most bad films a feeling that it is just a flow of disconnected scenes. And yet the reason why this works is entirely because the special effects and the actors meld into the MCU so nicely that all the scenes lose concrete meaning. In a film about mystic dimensions, this works in the films favour. Your lack of engagement kind of backs the premise, and the relaxed pace draws you into a stupor. But unlike the overly silly Guardians of the Galaxy, this takes itself seriously enough.Even the fact that the film is copying Batman Begins, Big Trouble in Little China, the Matrix and to a lesser extent Inception just let you relax into it even more. You will learn nothing, yet be entertained.",6,2,5,9 November 2016
Pacific Rim," Massive Clunker
","This film is unoriginal inside and out. This film is a whirlpool that has sucked so many ideas from its obvious precursors (Godzilla, Transformers) and related works (Hellboy, Matrix, Aliens, Starship Trooper, Iron Man, Inception, District 9, the list is endless) that one expects it to be drowned in writs.This film has a script that is as poor as you'd come to expect. It isn't horrendous, but it often arrests the cast.The plot problems are few but marked. Some would not escape a child. So why can I still remember the film after the popcorn is finished?There is enough humour to cover the dialogue shortcomings, enough detail to keep you appreciative and seen in IMAX the carnage is sumptuous. The cinematic and visual symbolism from Del Torro is a cut above the usual fare.There are a few political ideas that creep to the surface. The film effectively excludes Europe from the plot - a definite message about the future. One solution to the problem of monster terrorism is to build a large wall and tell people they will be safe behind it. But what makes this movie more than the sum of its parts is the focus on the robots. This film is a clean homage to so many of the ideas that came before it, but they are fully supported by the characters who are purely there to do battle with monsters in large robots. Very little screen time is given over to any concept that isn't related to FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS. And ultimately this enlarges the film, because the action sequences are the heart and sole, not sections of a script written just for the video game. There is no message to discern beyond FIGHTING MONSTERS IN VERY LARGE ROBOTS is a thing.",7,1,6,17 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Looks good, sounds terrible
","When an audience gasps at an amazing looking backdrop, thats nice. When the same audience laughs out of shock at what they have just heard in the scene, thats not so good.This film looks great, no question. And the action is certainly well directed apart from the usual video game friendly inserts. But the script is beyond a joke.At times I thought that I was watching a set of big budget Monty Python sketches. The dialogue only had two settings; acceptable and dire. I don't expect hip irony - but watching Anakin chew through more poorly written adolescent wailing is not entertaining in the least.At the end of the film some parts of the audience were starting to clap, but the instinct was immediately snuffed out by the sense of disbelief felt by most of us.And yes, Yoda rocks.",4,0,0,17 May 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne to do it
","'Perhaps we can arrange a meet. ' 'Where are you now? ' 'I'm sitting in my office. ' 'I doubt that. ' 'Why would you doubt that? ' 'If you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face. 'Bourne remains street tough, and elusive. Only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy. Conversation is macho, to the point with only shards of Bond type gallows humour. Its all about the action.The feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well. A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist does this to great effect. There is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.If the shaky cam doesn't annoy you too much, enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going.",7,1,1,3 September 2007
Oblivion," Half Moon
","Much of Oblivion is like Moon, which is good. Unfortunately, it also bears a sad resemblance to Independence Day in the tail.But it is encouraging that Hollywood can deliver a sci-fi film that focuses on writing and theme without wanting to warp into dysfunction like the dreadful Prometheus.The story telling reveals what is necessary, making the assumption that the fairly standard plot does not require too much explanation. The world is dead, and Tom Cruise plays a Wall-E type maintenance role, with lingering doubts.It is as if someone has discovered that if the plot is straight forward, less time is spent covering the holes. And while the feeble end is probably what is required for a studio to green light the popcorn, we have been given enough to be satisfied.",6,1,5,14 April 2013
Watchmen," Laughing at the Comedian
","Its getting a bit difficult to choose between making one long movie, splitting material between two or three films, or just doing a TV serial.Watchmen mainly survives being packaged in one bundle. But the characters, the politics, the sexual politics and the plot begin to burst out of the seams. We are laughing when we should be in awe, and sometimes not laughing at the ironic humour.The acting was good in parts - but slightly too many characters remained 2 dimensional. Because a film can only really work at one speed and level at a time, we are occasionally presented with stuff that doesn't scan.But overall the film is entertaining throughout, and will challenge quite a few directors to risk more in what they deliver. But sometimes the format cannot frame the material.And who would have expected DC to be doing so well in the film franchise war?",7,0,3,7 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," An epic tale of nothing in particular
","In some respects it isn't really fair to put down The Matrix because it doesn't stretch to three films. The third outing is a little better than the second, with better action and a modest Star Trek level plot.I did like the action scenes, which didn't always give way to the meaningless fast paced CGI of many films these days. They reminded me of Aliens, with frenetic life or death fighting scenes backed up by hokum characters. But Neo's journey now follows a separate and unhelpful subplot, much like the video game it is no doubt modeled for.After seeing the various short films in the Animatrix, its obvious that The Matrix as a whole remains a strong idea, even past the first movie. But under commercial pressure, the need for fireworks finally upends the whole enterprise, and we come away knowing that at Least Return of the King will still be worthwhile.",6,0,0,9 November 2003
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Well versed
","This is one of the better films I've seen in years, telling a traditional story with panache, humour and feeling. It definitely throws a spanner in the superhero juggernaut because it is a Sony picture, its an animation and it is probably the best Spider-man film out there.It is both familiar and sometimes quite weird, with a quality in the artwork that means there is plenty of emotion in the faces when needed. At no point did I feel the film had nothing to say, or had run out of road. The lack of focus in the visuals in the last 5 minutes compared to the art vistas on the screen for most of the time. And yet nothing truly new or original was there, just a good story and a lot of paint.",8,2,4,31 January 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Age of Marvel
","Despite the rather similar line up, it has obviously been decided that Captain America films would involve a little more of the adult world, leaving the Avengers movies for pure SMASH. Hence the Age of Ultron was a bit of a mess, but the Cap is ahead of the curve. Another clue is the leaving out of the ultra cartoons Hulk and Thor.One of the advantages of Captain America is precisely his lack of charisma. That throws the laugh lines to everyone else - even the Vision gets to clown about. And it's the humour, interjected in the action and intrigue that is handing these films a massive boost. The Black Panther is mainly given space to be Noble (joking aside, he is the one actually enhanced black guy, not mere sidekick). And Spider Man, take 3, is probably the best man / boy for the job.Once you get used to the sudden switches of city (usually with the name written across the entire screen) the frenetic pace doesn't trip the film up. There are still a number of plot holes and lacunae, but these are forgotten about because we got to see gems like Tony Stark sitting in Peter Parker's student room, chatting up Aunt May.The plot is certainly one we've seen before, but is a better way to house this type of titanic film than 'beat the super villain.. GO' or battle for the super thing-my. One of the strongest lines is given to the injured War Machine (or Iron Patriot. Or War Hammer) - who expresses his support for the hardline position right to the death - giving the film a palette of grey that allows for a serious review.",7,3,7,1 May 2016
Spirited Away," Fantasy is at its best when it touches the real world.
","When the heroines parents turn into pigs as punishment for their greed, leaving a young girl to solve the problems of the fantasy world she has entered, the viewer is immediately sucked in too.This animated feature is both vivid and entertaining, and while there is no attempt to be in original in the overall plot, the fantasy world depicted is certainly novel. The story is told in detail, from beginning to end, with charm and wit. While there is no doubt that this is Japanese, the film is on the whole Westerner friendly - the myths and fears pervading the story are ones most people are familiar with. This is a very good time for animation - with the array of styles available to producers (the Animatrix displays many of these) writers can get on with their job and let the animators do their job. The result is films like Spirited Away. I think a lot more writers who previously would not have considered animation must now be taking a second look.",7,1,2,7 October 2003
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Battle Royale
","To say the last ten years have brought forth many comic adaptations would be a daft understatement. With CGI coming of age, as well as the attention deficit generation, it made sense as a source.But until recently, most adaptations were actually films. That is - you were watching a film of a comic. With Scott Pilgrim, you are watching something that is part film, part comic, part video game. The logic of the film is not entirely cinematic. If you don't read comics or play video games - you simply won't be able to progress to the next level. Even when the logic runs as a film, the genre keeps altering through rom-com to bollywood. The constant battleground is a post student McJob Toronto, with a sort of 90s view of geek rock.While the plot is simply guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy battles with mystic evil ex-boyfriends to the death, the film isn't too bothered whether the audience is involved or not. Cool and funny things happen, but it seems all a bit esoteric.While much of the sensibility is Kevin Smith vs Douglas Coupland, and therefore pretty funny, I would expect that it will take a few more tries in this direction before a true classic emerges. But the attempts will be entertaining.",6,2,12,30 August 2010
Avengers: Endgame," End in sight
","So time travel. This just doesn't really ever work well, but as best it can the film tries. It goes the unexpected consequences route, and the new timeline route.There is some bravery pathos and humour in the aftermath of Thanos, and this gives the film a stronger emotional base than usual.I like the fact that Thanos is still smarter and ultimately more principled than the Avengers.But we get the usual dilution because of the number of characters not really involved. Or who just pose. And Captain Marvel appears to have suffered some reduction in her role, but still looks highly unbalanced.But the strength of the film is in the end which while not amazing is one of the better series ends I have seen.",7,1,4,27 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Bourne to do it
","This is not a Bond film. It isn't a self contained event action epic movie. In fact it is a relatively sparse, short affair. It's part of maybe a trilogy, and makes little sense without Casino Royale and the events that started there.Yes, some of the action sequences clearly are inspired by the other action spy franchise, as well as the reduced script. But there is still plenty of Bond pomp, perhaps without the outmoded humour. Set design is still a work of art.Taken on its own, this film is not remarkable, or special. It is clearly a last shedding of the old skin, that happens to resemble a few other action films. Its fitter, and more business like than before, but the old friend is still there somewhere.",6,9,21,31 October 2008
District 9," Iron man
","Like most people, I was disappointed the film fell into an enjoyable but witless Hollywood blockbuster without seeing out its mockumentary and political start.But that was always the problem; the film had no way of truly following up on the initial style so the audience can only have felt somewhat cheated. The lack of imagination in the plot could have helped develop the underlying message - but I had certainly lost faith in why the film was made before anything was resolved.But that can't take away the merits of the film - the successful CGI, and the anti-hero. So I came away thinking I'd seen half a good super hero film.",5,3,7,8 October 2009
It Follows," American Gothic ghost story
","There have been a lot of teen horror flicks, enough for a few smarter films to play gently with the genre. Here, death stalks from the middle distance.The film specifically places itself in a strange non time period that appears to mix a post 2007 urban collapse with the 1980s symbolism. The quiet centre lets you anticipate the moments of strange horror, as the teenagers work through their restless angst. While the formula is set in stone, it is kept on such an even pace that you quickly fall under the spell.An engaging study of the impossibility yet inevitability of what follows us all.",6,73,146,20 March 2015
City of God," Once upon a time in Rio
","I'm not sure why this fim is compared with Goodfellas - it is a somewhat better film than that. The true comparsion is with the more epic films.Most directors have the ability to tell a story by jumping around in time, but in each period we visit the viewer gets the chance to live with the characters, and this makes the film exceptional. Only when you understand a characters circumstances does his full story get revealed. This intelligent build up never leaves you wondering. And yet the cast of chacaters is large and varied. No one is just a cipher.This is the story of a young man growing up, so some of the characters, especially women, reflect teenage frustrations. Gang violence is shown for what it is - a foolish and terminal lifestyle for those with few choices or homicidal tendencies.",10,0,2,13 January 2003
Legend," Super Smash Bros
","Legend is a slightly strange title, in whichever sense the word is used. The Krays are the only celebrity criminals in British history; but that is because you can steal more money in legitimate business. Tom's twin turn is superb, but the script doesn't allow for too many fireworks - occasionally Ron comes into his own. The film chooses the popular string of scenes style, which tries to reduce the narrative to a comic strip. But there isn't enough drama to sustain this. The choice of scenes was clearly dictated by how costly it would be to make them look OK. Authenticity isn't attempted, which seems reasonable as the audience probably would consider it costume drama otherwise.Unsurprisingly the film falls to either focus on actual events very closely or being a serious gangster genre film. So we don't get Scarface - and I would recommend re- watching that instead.",5,1,3,26 September 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," The Stream of Now
","How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.",6,35,73,28 April 2018
Get Out," Sunken Brothers
","I don't see too many of these type of teen horror movies as they are rarely good or original.There have been a few original ideas that made good small films - 'it follows' was a shining example. But Get Out comes at things quite differently - being both political, occasionally funny and appropriately weird.In the end you are presented with a cross between Being John Malkovich and The Lobster, with not quite enough developed material to pull it through. The performances give it a little gravitas, but the ambition tails off.",5,2,9,5 April 2017
Ex Machina," Do the robot
","This three hander play is quite traditional. It just happens to include a robot. Almost, but not quite, a nuclear family. For those unfamiliar with the idea, this is a real science fiction story. The genre isn't and never was about spaceships and ray guns until Star Wars appeared (and that wasn't science fiction either - it was straight up fantasy). Science fiction is always about social politics. Here, the politics is largely about identity and control.It is a fairly profound examination of both ends of the Turing test, and for getting all this so right, Alex Garland must be congratulated. Strangely, the real 'bluebook' company of the film, i.e. Google in real life, would not do anything as pedestrian as build an AI. I feel that all the technical points were passed - even the (python?) code on screen wasn't utter gibberish.There is an almost Asmovian feel of clean simplicity to everything, and the film leans heavily on peoples emotional fallibility. Indeed, there is a slightly retrograde feel to the ultra modern house set, as if it owed more to Kubrik's 2001 than to a rich kids play pen.In all, a very watch-able triumph of the nerd.",7,2,13,4 February 2015
Transformers," Robots of Dawn
","The image of very large robots hiding out of sight around a suburban house is a wonderfully childish scene. The image of a jet fighter plane transforming and turning against the squadron it hid with is quite something.Structurewise, there is little here that is different from any summer blockbuster - slightly superior teen flick standard. But just as LotR declared year zero for visual effects, Transformers give us a perfect blend of live action and CGI. The transformations are stunning, and I never grew tired of watching them.The film is not too dominated by its many set pieces; nor is it ruined by squeezing humour into the bits where proper dialogue should appear. In summary this is somewhat short of real film making, but it achieves its aim of entertaining for its entire length.",7,1,2,26 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," They keep moving just out of the range of our guns
","The original Star Wars, now 40 years old, was always presented as a complete but fairly sterile universe. We enjoyed the heroics of the first 3 films, but were largely nonplussed by the CGI laden effects of the next 3. Like the last film, this is a return to form.And however enjoyable this romp is, it effectively admits that there is nothing much more that can be done with the franchise at the moment. The film is probably as entertaining as any of the other Star Wars films, and even shows occasional flashes of strong film making. But the fresh stuff cannot quite escape the weight of it's own familiar format. The Star Wars pieces are deftly moved about in grand sweeps, but with surprisingly little outcome. The character arcs seem strangely un-epic.The humour is deployed well, but just serves to reduce the size of the characters, because there is little counter-balancing in tension. At no time do we learn anything new about the Star Wars universe, or anything about where we are today in the real world. It is stuck in a fixed moral code. The attempted theme of renewal splutters along careful tramlines, and just about keeps the show on the road.Overall the film is satisfying, and is more than just filler for the video games and McDonald's toys, but it needs something fairy strong to make it anything more than an echo of what it was.",6,12,28,14 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Better than John Carter of Mars
","Marvel delivers entertainment, special effects and usually a boatload of action. But with the relative success of Pacific Rim, (and as memory dims on John Carter) Marvel/Disney is probably wondering if it's property is sometimes a bit of a trap.I understand that in the franchise world, a one off film with new characters is a ridiculous risk, and this probably accounts for why the film is so very conservative in nature. The film trades the usual minor philosophical dilemma for fairly weak humour. It is a well trodden journey in familiar surroundings, at least told with panache and great visual effects. But I must say, there is something impressive about the rendition of a tree and a raccoon, and in fact all around the effects are pushing the bounds of what we've seen before.Very entertaining, but urgently forgettable.",6,1,6,1 August 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The sound of no hands clapping
","I have no outstanding memories of this film whatsoever. There is Uma in a yellow jacket. Well, thats the poster. What else? My emotions remained wholly untouched, and my intellect stayed in bed. At some point in the crush to rip off the past, surely you are supposed to do something clever and original, no? Some modern point, some latter day twist. Thats the deal isn't it? I get the old stuff repackaged, upgraded and given a bit of a shine. A little irony, a little sarcasm. A new message from old ideas. Respect for your elders, with the hip sounds of now. Sorry, no deal. This film delivers your own DVD collection (and if you are a Tarantino fan, this statement is true) back at you with little interesting added. Crouching Tiger gave us strong women and male anxiety. The Matrix gave us some interesting questions about life. Mr Tarantino gives us a tricksy cereal box. When this sort of film gets made elsewhere, one would expect on the stars to put in an over the top performance and make the film their own. But I suspect that this isn't possible with Mr Tarantino sitting on the chair. Someone somewhere needed to tell somebody something. Maybe the audience can.So if you plan to see this film, buckle up for the ride. Then make sure you have a good film to watch afterwards to make the day worth while.",4,2,4,20 October 2003
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of LOLtron
","With the strength of the Winter Soldier, Marvel has outed itself as being capable of producing a film to compete with the Dark Knight. So the direction of the Avengers is a marker to how they see the war against the DCU panning out. Essentially, Age of Ultron is a great piece of entertainment, but the threads of it's own destruction are built in. As the main artery for new characters, this film runs out of time to really introduce them. We get the one liners, the strong moments between the existing cast but in the background the mechanics of the plot cycle on with little explanation. The casual breaking of cannon (no spoilers here) does not seem to be done to create anything stronger - instead all the new characters are somewhat malformed. Ultron has the humour of Stark, but the enemy doesn't really add anything new to deal with. As the entertainment explodes onto the screen, the films franchise implodes.",7,4,11,25 April 2015
The Dark Knight," Knives and lint
","I think Lord of the Rings broke cinema, this is the visible next step. It gets a ten because there is no reason to give it anything less. It won't cure cancer, or help us reach the stars. It will however help destroy a thousand vapid films not yet made.It delivers superb entertainment, all round. The film quality (I saw it without Imax), the editing, the cinematography, the script are all notable on their own. This movie is complex, but at no point diffuse. Sentiment is sparing. It is all focused on the moment, which oddly many action films do not manage.It has the deadly surprise elements of a Beat Takeshi film, the epic quality of Heat, the chaotic element of Isaac Asimov's Mule. It is a superhero film no more than Godfather is a cop film.Its a reason to see films, and for Hollywood to continue.",10,3,7,25 July 2008
Avatar," Astonishing film for the start of a new decade: 1990
","So how to make a film that keeps cinemas open through the recession? Use new technology, and make sure the story works all over the world. The 3D is of course the only point of this release. It is a mark in the sand. There is no throwing things in your face 3D here - just giving an extra depth to a new world.I see people asking 'Why does Avatar make marines bad?' Its because this film must pull its weight around the world - and retelling the invasion myth of America with different winners appeals to world opinion in this particular time with unethical wars appear to be the fault of America.But appealing to world taste may have gone awry here. This film seems to place itself about two decades backwards in film chronology. It isn't just using Signourey Weaver that signals this. Blade Runner was 1982. Aliens was 1986. Dances with Wolves was 1990. The Matrix, 1999, looks clearly advanced in ideas compared to the sub L. Ron Hubbard rubbish that Avatar develops. Compare 'World tree' to 'We are all Avatars unless we unplug'.I thought Lord of the Rings achieved something with a real myth retold strongly in a modern idiom. Avatar seems more applicable to a Dr Who episode from time gone by.",6,0,3,2 January 2010
War of the Worlds," Your child has potential, but he must concentrate
","It is nice to see a proper film maker in action. He has his ticks and traits, but for the most part the film is a class apart the usual turgid Hollywood rubbish.The comparison to sleeper terrorists in our midst is clever. The war machines make scary noises, they are familiar and a little steam-punk in nature. We see angles from mirrors, people through glass, lights and scary noises etc. The battle scenes are chaotic and inconclusive. The people are greedy, with occasional acts of kindness. Alien children play where they should not, until recalled to the mother-ship.But as Cruise looks over the bloody landscape, we can already feel the director longing to move onto a different movie. The film limps to an almost Starship Troopers ending, probably because Spielberg does not know what to do with the license at this point. Its clearly not a project he has spent too much time with.Its ironic to think that a director will only be careful with the consistency of the content if there is a franchise to protect. Spielberg has given cinema a hell of a lot, but like Lucas, he is maybe getting some indifferent advice from his friends.",6,0,1,31 July 2005
The Last King of Scotland," An evil dictactor ruined my holiday
","Africa throws up a great deal of modern dictators, but Amin was something else by any standards. In this film we get a great actorly cameo of him, though surprisingly little about Uganda. But we do get to know about a fictitious Scotsman.On retrospect, a film about Idi Amin was never going to be very good if after 15 minutes our Scotsman anti-hero, the observer device for the film, was still wasting time with another non character whose entire part could have been removed.In the excellent Downfall, we get to see a troubled Hitler - but the writer gets right with the man himself and the people round him. No time is wasted on those not relevant to helping the audience understand.I know Forest Whittaker is a great actor, and this role was clearly one he relished. Its a pity that the director felt that the other characters had to be one dimensional for the film to work. Is that how they thought Amin came to power? For a film about Idi Amin, it could have done with a bit more about Idi Amin. In the end our Scotsman anti-hero soaks up so much time that one feels sorry he's has a holiday ruined by some silly black dictator. Should have gone to Club 18-30.",6,6,11,20 January 2007
The Wrestler," Use my leg
","There are two stories here, one involves the film and the other is about the director.Micky Rourke totally owns, as the faded wrestler. And for that reason, the film is a remarkable if linear tale of belief over reality. There is memory of yesteryear, and then there is Rourkes 'broken down piece of meat' body.You will not feel changed after the film, because Rourke lives it for you. No message is put across, because Rourke learns nothing. Except a few extra uses for office supplies and prosthetic appendages.But what of the director of Pi, Requim for a Dream and The Fountain? Darren Aronofsky seems to have an eye for the fated path, and maybe for metamorphosis. Beyond that, this is a talented director with a few interesting projects coming up. I'm not sure The Wrestler really advances him too far, apart from his Tarantino like rediscovery of a former favourite.",6,5,12,21 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This is George. Say hello George.
","This film answers the question 'how rich do you have to be before no one dares tells you that you require help?'This film is good fun, and yes its better-than-the last-two but it has reached a new level of dire writing. Just having wooden dialogue won't do now. Oh no. Now its all about completely unbelievable reactions.'Join with me on the dark side' 'No, I have spent my life fighting for evil' 'OK, what if I add some jeopardy?' 'Nah, thats not quite doing it for me' 'Please..' 'Well, I'm a bit confused now.' 'The pays better' 'Ok, whatever - whats for starters?' 'Great - fancy slaughtering the innocent?' 'You got it'There must have been a lot of intelligent people involved in this film. And yet they all bought into the above script. My only assumption is that George must have had a very bad time with one of his daughters getting involved with a bad guy. So he thought 'I know, I'll write about it in my next film'. Hey, I'm guessing - can you do better? Can you help George out? He needs ideas badly.",6,2,3,28 May 2005
Inception," lucid dreaming
","So time for more expensively filmed science fiction entertainment. At least this is not a comic adaption. Should this have been a TV series? Nolan tries his best to keep it within the bounds of cinema and mainly pulls it off.As the actors are pushed around the set and through the rushed plot, the layer below the slightly antiseptic action scenes becomes apparent. The high hokum is in the employ of fairly intelligent questions.One of the problems that has to be faced by films using virtual scenarios is to set the right level of jeopardy. This is done on the hoof in Inception, with rules of the game announced as we go. Yet the director rarely abuses this.The classic problem with the Matrix era films was unexplained pop video place changes largely to show off budget - but everyone still behaved as if they were in LA. To some degree Inception nods at this with its own high sheen low fidelity changes, but is also gently ribbing them. Its all a dream, of course.There is no question that by the last scene you feel that another concept has escaped the original film - I think this is what people are referring to as cerebral. It is a badge of faith that the film is improved on repeat viewing (i.e. it is too dense for one telling) and that leaves the film as a work that will live as much on the internet forums as in your head.",7,0,7,17 July 2010
Parasite," Dark City
","This is a bravura and surprising thriller, with a fancy modernist brutalist house as one of the leading stars. There is little doubt that as a loser family start to target a rich household, their early success cannot hold.I'm a fan of Korean films anyway, and so was relaxed about the various styles this film goes through. While the film is totally accessible, there are still enough references to Korean and Asian society to make it a little demanding on the viewer - which is why the Oscar success was nicely surprising.The film does not perfectly handle it's different layers - the political message and the moral message rather wrap around each other awkwardly. The pacing doesn't always work either - the direction is relaxed in the house but pokes around nervously outdoors.This is not the best Korean film I've seen - Old Boy and I saw the Devil were superior - but the setup, cinematography and the sheer chutzpah of the plotting make it a sharp witted success. (I don't reference the classic Old Boy accidentally; that too was effectively a double layered film, and on reflection it was a little better at it.)",7,0,3,22 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Stardust memories
","Much to this films credit, it defies a quick summary. Play within play within film, modern day fable, Blockbuster buster - suffice to say it has quite a few threads hanging off it that don't really help with defining it.It is, at least, the search for relevance in the wrong place. The acting is unusually good from a variety of sources. Keaton handles his careless madness well, and all the supporting characters help to build the showtime nightmare world that Keaton's own Birdman has helped create. Because the film is effectively so self referential, I suspect reviewers will be flaying around for meaning. I will only say that this very much what Woody Allen would be doing if he wanted to reprise the ideas in Stardust Memories. Or maybe Celebrity. In fact, this effective ensemble piece picks up on many of the great directors' themes.The film is clever, but it is always entertaining. The changes of pace are not always handled with care, which may leave people with the idea that the film is too long. It mocks blockbusters, but lives on it's own as a New York tale.",7,0,4,27 December 2014
Prometheus," The roof is on fire
","It is the nature of a small independent film that there will be occasional problems with lighting, sound quality, continuity and sometimes editing. If the film is strong, small issues will not derail it.But this much anticipated film with a high budget is wholly upended by a poor script, odd plotting and some desperate clichés. What I don't understand with a film of this magnitude and inheritance is how so many basics go awry.There is a basic feeling of chaos, as if Mike Leigh has refused to tell the characters what their motivations are. There is some unsettled acting, but the root cause is the script. The screenplay often looks like a bad school performance. Crew on a trillion dollar mission just mill about. The aliens would embarrass Men in Black. The bits of plot nonsense are inescapable and kill the film a a spectacle: <ul><li>A geologist, who has provided mapping tools gets lost in a one level cave. - Two characters run away from a massive rolling wheel in the same line that it is rolling - The ships captain, suddenly ignores protocol and open the door to a zombie. - Seconds after major abdominal surgery, our hero runs about like a spring lamb.</li></ul>There are plenty of bits that go right, but they cannot keep the structure from tottering. Knowing that there are follow up films cannot be treated like a patch fix.",6,3,6,7 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Hiding something
","The Dark Knight trilogy tells us a lot about Nolans understanding of modern cinema, as well as his control over the Batman franchise.It's not always obvious that Nolan is that interested in the hero genre, more with continuing the journey he started with Inception (along with much of the same cast). But the advantage of this is that the scenes with Batman and Bruce Wayne have no extra gravity to them, giving the chance for characters to develop.To a degree.Even approaching 3 hours, Nolan stretches his skill and that of the cast to rush through much of the plot, especially the back-stories that he isn't much interested in. This leads to the usual number of unexplained convergences, plot vacancies and narrative extended death scenes that plague most modern films. Yes, it drives the internet forums and people see the films again but this weakens cinema and strengthens the longer TV serials that attract so many film directors. Nolans exploration of identity (every character has a masked past, present or future) feels compressed here, fitted between the blowing up of the scenery.Looking through his, er, oeuvre, it is clear that Nolans interest in perception was best met by Christopher Priest with The Prestige. I can see Nolan and Priest combining again, but I can't see him trying another full action film - his disdain for the material is starting to surface.",8,6,10,8 August 2012
Black Panther," Wakanda is the new Asgard
","With Disney setting the ground rules, we now know that Captain America gets the adult themes, leaving Black Panther and the others to tow the family with it. Unfortunately, one of the villains from the backstory isn't really quite Disney, so the film mixes a Bond lack of sentimentality at the beginning before going full Lion King at the end. The political points do hit home properly, but don't stay with you. The design and look of the film was as spectacular as sold, and mostly everything makes sense. It is this that will keep Black Panther going. There was a certain elan, which is missing from many other Marvel works. The afrofuturism provides an ever present thematic anchor.The film follows the 'first in franschise' template that states you must see lots of Wakanda and its denizens. Yet when it is slightly mysterious it is much better. Consequenly too much time is spent with the royal family and it feels like Thor in Asgard. The film was strongest away from there.At the end you can feel that this film was carefully guided down a safe path to protect it, but it could have done with less of that. Character development suffered because the Avengers gets all the good dialogue work. The final fight was the usual weakly choreographed fudge, a decades old format now. And the Black Panther is as strong in his mask as he is lightweight without it.",6,4,7,18 March 2018
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," No country for neurotic tourists.
","Barcelona is a beautiful city, and frankly I'd watch Cruz or Johansson take the trash out. So there was little chance of this new Woody Allen film going wrong.Allen is beyond both American and European clichés, so can play with both fairly well. We see two American tourists enchanted by the surface culture of Spain, and their own inward uncertainty.Allen has the massive advantage of knowing he is only ever telling one story, so finds it easy to refresh his work. That is partly why most good actors will appear in his films and do a good job - as the well appointed cast does here. Rebecca Hall does a great turn as the modern female version of the classic nebbish.Where does this fit into the Allen pantheon? As his power wanes, his control weakens and so the impact of the piece fades a little. But at many points this has the strength of Manhatten or Sisters, and is a welcome addition.",6,3,7,30 January 2009
Beowulf," Beowulf in 3D - partly
","First of all 3D is not a gimmick - without it this type of movie goes straight to XBox without a cinematic release. While Beowulf is just another Lord of the Rings wannabe, neither true to the source material nor actually a film - this is what the next few years hold.Overall the movie is great entertainment. There is a neat enough plot, the effects are fairly spectacular. And it probably hangs together a bit better than 300. It doesn't have the finesse of Sin City - and 3D cannot cover the usual Hollywood film weaknesses. But at no point does it let up.We now have the three directions that all other blockbusters will go. CGI as realisation (Lord of the Rings, Transformers), CGI as style maker (Sin City, 300) and CGI as everything (Beowulf, Final Fantasy). There doesn't seem to be room for using CGI in just a few scenes anymore. No room for anything else.",6,9,19,7 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard with hokum
","When faced with the usual made by numbers mish mash action film, you hang on to the odd funny lines or maybe something good going in under the covers. There is little to cheer here, just lost time.Bruce Willis rolls around effectively. The geek is too Neo like but workable. The action scenes are ridiculous, the plot problems appear faster than the script team can rewrite, and there are a few genuine Attack of the Clones style clangers.But the action is nothing if not well directed, and entertainment does not have to be great. The computer scenes are improving - no longer do we see an entire screen dedicated to saying 'You have mail' or other movie only software.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Back to the future
","Star Wars represented the return to simple values in the era of the Parallax View, Capricorn One, The Conversation, Three Days of the Condor, Klute, Solyent Green, and of course The Boys From Brazil.It is not surprising that Disney chooses to go back to a Galaxy Far Far Away, because they want to own your childhood dreams - not your adult fears. You can resell dreams forever.JJ Abrams foray into the Star Trek universe hasn't worked because it never gave him the simple narrative a story teller craves for. But he is totally at home with the elite family tree of the Skywalker clan.By trading away originality, Abrams sticks to telling a familiar story which keeps the film cohesive throughout, and joyfully uses CGI as little as possible. The mysteries of the Force remain, and the children with daddy issues reign supreme. The film drags occasionally - oh look, yet more scenes of people running into Freudian forests. But the knowing humour, the superb cinematography throughout and the obvious fact that the cast were having a blast will win you over.",7,1,13,21 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," There are no better screen images in cinema
","I'm not really tempted to spend any time talking about the plot, the acting or the general film making because what you see on the screen around and during the battles is truly amazing. It really is in a completely different class to any images I've seen in a movie. One scene sticks in my mind. A mad king, on fire, jumps off the top of his palace atop a city tower and the camera pans back to view the battlefield below which he descends into. I have no clue as to how this was even conceived.  The city that the battle takes place around is in itself better than any of the creations thus far in the trilogy, and those were all stunning. When the invading army uses a huge catapult to throw rocks at the walls, you want to go for your mobile and phone a World Heritage representative to have the war stopped immediately. Only when the effects descend to normal levels do you remember that you are just watching a film. I am not trying to undermine the film by focusing on on what is, after all, some form of CGI, but we are talking about persistent images that go some way beyond anything seen in a film so far.

","Lets make a film about revolution. Faceless police, beatings, heroes stick together, Up The Revolution!No, I grow bored.Lets make a film about political plotting; who is on the inside, the devious leader...Hmm.What about that bit in Rollerball where the system is run for the upper class..No, I tire of this. Lets throw in The Cube. A film about a group of people thrown into a rotating set of traps with no obvious exit.Forget it. You know that stuff in Lost where they get attacked by the environment? Throw that in...No. No. No.Lets make a film about revolution..",3,46,91,1 December 2013
What We Do in the Shadows," Won't survive the light of day
","The mockumentary has not really had a good recent workout, due to the Fear of Looking Shallow. Why mock, when we can celebrate? In this case, what is apparently being mocked doesn't even exist. But this vampire flatmates genre flick certainly has the dial turned up to.. well not quite 11 but pretty high.What is fresh here is the humorous eye that laughs at the fallacies of the Hollywood vampire myth as well as the bro culture that the film is actually about. I loved the flatmates helping each other dress up for a night out because 'they can't use mirrors, so don't know what they look like'. They can only hang out in certain clubs, due to having to be invited in.Probably the peak of the humour involves the werewolves being a dumb Iron John self help group - 'Werewolves don't swear!' - who seem to be in continual crises. Even the pathos about death is more or less pitch perfect.This has the strength to be a cult, but if it shames the torrent of vampire crap and angst hangers-on (yes Being Human, I'm looking at you) that gets churned out at a truly scary rate - so much the better.",7,2,10,20 August 2014
300," Do you like it hard?
","If you liked the style of Sin City, but wanted more fantasy violence, and a little homo erotica, this film is hard to beat. Seeing this in an IMAX only underlined how good it looks and sounds. Occasionally the Calvin Klein ad cut scenes did make the film a touch disjointed, but with such a simplified plot there was nothing to think about.This is yet another style over substance film, one which dedicates itself to a look and feel, not to historical perspective or acting. So one must judge the style; and that is good.At times the bizarre 'homos vs trannies' daydream the director was having did start to become flesh. And yes, I did feel that the whole thing may have been intentional anti Asian propaganda. But fortunately the unrelenting CGI did not allow you time to settle on irrelevant details for very long.Unlike the unsure Gladiator, this film only exists in a single hyperactive tempo - but, as Morrisey says, why pamper life's complexities, when the leather runs smooth On the passenger seat?",6,1,4,4 April 2007
Sin City," All in Black and white. And some red. Plus a bit of yellow.
","From start to finish you are in BaSin City. No explanations, no updates, just the facts. Everything revolves around bringing a recognisable yet outlandish comic noir world to screen - the effects are completely slave to this one master. The format is Pulp Fiction, the violence is Reservoir Dogs, the action is From Dusk Till Dawn. The result is in some ways more satisfying than all of these.The performances are pitch perfect. The only slightly bum note is Clive Owen, who has a little difficulty with his performance. He doesn't have the background or depth to really pull his character off - too many Brit flicks have tainted his ability to act. Everyone else knows the territory and come off the page without effort.So pull on your mac, get into your hard top and get some action in Basin City.",8,0,2,4 June 2005
Spectre," Sam's Pathetic Ersatz Copied and Tired Rehash Entrails
","Or maybe INTROSPECTION. Someone has to stop Sam Mendes digging into 007s fictive past, just to smear it all over the screen. We get another villain who is actually not a villain, but a sad victim with emotional issues. Taking over the world takes a distant second place to telling Bond about his childhood. Maybe he is actually Sigmund Bond. I complained that Skyfall ended like Home Alone. Aspects of Spectre ended like Scooby Do, with the team driving around together in their own bloody Mystery Machine. Mendes can't seem to grasp how to represent the machinations of a large organisation. The wonderful board room scene, as with so many nice looking scenes, actually represents nothing. Mendes can shoot a movie; much of Spectre looks lush. Unfortunately much of it also looks like both The Spy Who Loved Me and Quantum of Solace. What is particularly annoying about Mendes is that he knows enough to copy the outer shell of a Bond film, but has no idea what he is doing. Much like a child playing with a shiny piece of an engine. Maybe the directing of Bond films could be protected by an act of Parliament.One of the most endearing thing in Fleming's universe is that MI6 is almost as implacable as the villains. But for the second time in a row, we see MI6 in chaos - but in such a shallow way that would be embarrassing for an episode of Spooks. Mendes does the loving long shots, for instance of a train going through the desert, but then the action on the train is a tired rehash of many films including many past Bonds. The train is also the site for a shockingly sad romance attempt, which had the audience bemused in it's sheer incompetence.I fear this film will be found out on a second viewing, it is actually quite uneven - too long in most areas yet rushed in some places. The smarter actors reduced their screen time to a minimum. Belucci escaped quickly, Waltz kept his scenes tight. Hopefully we can get back to a proper Bond film with a director who understands the espionage language, and actually likes and maybe understands the Bond franchise.",6,15,43,26 October 2015
Moon," Dark side of the Moon
","Here is an engrossing intelligent small film that repays a bit of knowledge of its genre. Referening a host of the 70s cult sci-fi films (Dark Star, Silent Running, Solaris, Outlands, Alien, Blade Runner, 2001 etc.) we are given what appears to be a man and his robot minding a corporate lunar mining venture.With a Clint Mansell soundtrack, (which I'm listening to on Spotify), this film sounds great. Unfortunately it sometimes looks a little sub par because, well, the limited budget. You will wince a little at the use of miniatures for the outside moon shots. But stay with.Sci-fi has always been used to explore social politics, and this film touches on various borderline issues but in a fairly close, emotional and involving way. Which is why maybe Silent Running is its true parent.In order to deliver the homage, we do get the old pat and outdated clichés; corporates are all bad, computers can understand humans, unnecessary countdowns etc. This doesn't stop the enjoyment, but makes me appreciate the recent well financed TV series sci-fi for taking the time to push the envelope a bit. I hope the producers trust the makers with a touch more cash to really make something a bit bigger.",6,3,8,26 July 2009
The Great Gatsby," The Green Light
","This film comes under the section of 'not sure why they made the it'. Lovely looking in 3D it is, but in a ridiculous toontown way. Indeed this would have made a more convincing animated film.The Idee fixe of the green light may have supreme importance in the book, but in this film I began to think I was a mysterious alien signal. In fact it was more fascinating than most of the dialogue and storyline.DiCaprio is quite good at the suggestion of something not quite right. And yet he doesn't seem to occupy the space the others are in. Toby Macguire seems more interested in the era, but insists on the wide eyed Marvel character still.Ultimately there is not enough to fill 2 hours of film. The movie is set in a cartoon world that without having the purity of a cartoon. The basic story doesn't deserve the screen time, or it needs to be told by someone with something to say. And yet - there is a little film called Metropolitan from decades ago that this razzmatazzfest could have learnt from. A film about another class and outsiders. I recommend you watch that instead.",6,0,3,31 May 2013
