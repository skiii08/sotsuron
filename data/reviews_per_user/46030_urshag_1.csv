Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great fun and worth the wait.
","I was thrilled to finally see The Phantom Menace.  I think Jar Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker received a little too much screen time for my tastes, and their respective 'cute' type humor could have been toned down. (Kids will probably enjoy it though.)But the Jedi fight scenes were well worth the price of admission. Seeing the Senate and the political machinations of Palpatine were interesting as well.  I have seen it twice now, and I still feel the need to see it again. There are many small things you don't notice the first time around, like the Wookie senators in the Senate scene.  The bottom line is this:  If you love the original Star Wars movies, you will love The Phantom Menace.",8,0,0,23 May 1999
