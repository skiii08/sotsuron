Scarface," revolutionizing the crime genre
","scarface is amazing film in my book it is right up there with the likes of godfather and good-fellas. the duologue between characters is great, the story is exciting and captivating you will want to watch it again and again just to here the line say hello to my little friend. Al Pacino is a treat to watch he plays Cuban immigrant who starts with nothing works his way up to the top and loses it all. Any fan of Pacino has to watch this film! Al Pacino at his very best. An underrated film with amazing potential. This amazing film gives a true view on criminal life. Godfather may beat it for epicness Good fellas may beat it for style but scarface wins hands down for pure entertainment. WATCH IT! LOVE IT! AND WATCH IT AGAIN!",8,0,1,15 February 2006
The Godfather," the greatest film of all time
",i have only recently watched this film for the first time on TV. i didn't know what to expect i have herd great things from some people and not so great things from other people. i had previously never seen a AL Pacino film. then i watched what i believe to be the greatest film ever made and after looking at IMDb's top 250 list i realized a lot of other people loved it to. i loved it from start to finish i was immensely enthralled from beginning to end.this film has superb performances from all the cast. especially from AL Pacino who plays Michael coreleone the son of feared don Marlon Brando who dilverd another great performance. this film got me hooked on crime movies and on AL pacino who is know my favorite actor of all time and also the best. i wouldn't say every body will love this film it is slow to begin with and some people with no taste in film will say it is boring which absolutely incorrect. if you like films at all you have to see the godfather.,10,2,5,1 August 2006
