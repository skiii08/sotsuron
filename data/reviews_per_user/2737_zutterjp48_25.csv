Catch Me If You Can," An amusing comedy based on the real story
","I enjoyed very much this film because we make at the same time a serious travel in the world of the swindle and the forgery but also a funny travel in the life of of all the tricks Frank Abagnale finds to avoid the police and begin a new life for example.Frank Abagnale Jr was really a very skillfull forger and impersonator (a Pan Am pilot,a doctor, a legal prosecutor).Then we have the story of Carl Hanratty, a FBI bank fraud agent who tries to catch the very clever and astute Frank.
The performances of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom hans and Christopher Walken are very good.As the film is based on a real story we know at the end what happened in the real life with two main characters.",8,1,2,12 July 2019
Child 44," No serial murder in the Soviet Union
","Based on the case of Andrei Chikatilo Child 44 is a tough and dramatic film that describes the fight of a man against a serial murder.For the official proganda the Soviet Union doesn't have serial murders.Leo Demidov will remove all the country to find this murder.The performances of Tom Hardy, Gary Olman and Vincent Cassel are quite good.",7,0,0,9 April 2019
Superbad," A crazy night
","I am fond of 'A crazy night' films such as The Sitter , Nick& Norah's Infinite playlist , Date Night in which the main characters hope to spend a pleasant night , but suddenly a lot of things goes wrong, but they always survive this night. This night no needs to end in a 'One night stand', sometimes after these tribulations the characters realize that they have a new girlfriend o a new boyfriend, and this is another story.The most important is the friendship between these mains characters.
So I enjoyed very much 'Superbad', because the story is quite crazy , funny and touching.
Thanks Michael Cera and Jonas Hill for your brillant performance !!",8,2,2,19 August 2019
Hot Fuzz," Troubles in Sandford
","It's quite difficult to write something new about this film !! Hot Fuzz is at the same a very good comedy about a little English town with it's colourfull people, its traditions and its secrets and a film with quite a lot of action,shots., persecution, usw. Sometimes these actions are so exaggerated as in Quentin Tarantino film !!
About performances I can not be totally objective, because I am a fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost since 'Shaun of the Dead' !!
Finally this film is full of humour, sometimes black humour !!",8,1,1,9 May 2019
Hotel Rwanda," The Rwanda genocide and the cinema.
","Many years ago I saw 'Hotel Rwanda' and I enjoyed this film, because I knew the story of the civil war and of the genocide in Rwanda (also because I have lived in Rwanda some years in the seventies).This film is well known (over 300.000 ratings in imdb) !! There are other very good films about the civil war and the Rwandan genocide: 'Un dimanche à Kigali, Sometimes in April, Kinyarwanda, Shooting dogs !! Taking one some distance 'Hotel Rwanda' looks then like the story of an Rwandan Schindler !!
The performance of Don Cheadle is very good.
Finally all these films about Rwanda are complementary: several points of view about the same tragedy !!",7,0,0,27 December 2019
Taxi Driver," Travis Bickle/Robert de Niro
","It's quite difficult to write something new about this film.Taxi Driver is really a great film.The performance of Robert de Niro is extraordinary, but Hervey Keitel and the young Jodie Foster are remarkable.Therefore Taxi Driver is one of the most memorable film of the Seventies in the United States.",8,0,0,10 March 2019
Forrest Gump," A sweet, touching and funny comedy
","It's quite difficult to write something new about 'Forrest Gump''.What words shall I use to describe a master piece of U.S. cinema ? A very fascinating story of a generous man who suffered and enjoyed the life.It's also a review through the history of United States : Vietnam war, John F. Kennedy, Nixon, etc with very funny comments !!
The performance of Tom Hanks is extraordinary, but the other actors and actresses (Robin Wright, Gary Sinise for example) were also extraodinary.
A master piece of tenderness and humour !!",9,1,1,29 May 2019
The Bourne Identity," A very good action/spy film.
","This is a story about a young man who has been rescued in the Mediterranean Sea and who is now looking for his identity.This search leads him to Zurich and then to Paris in France.Jason Bourne is vulnerable heroe: he is fighting with his amnesy and he knows that somebody or a organization wants to destroy him.
I enjoyed very much this story: about performances Matt Damon is a very actor and Franka Potente who will share the adventures of Jason Bourne is charming.",8,0,0,22 May 2020
Bridge of Spies," A good historical and dramatic film
","In 1957 James B. Donovan ,an insurance lawyer, becomes the defense counsel of Rudolf Abel.Donovan is a very intelligent man: he is convinced that Rudolf Abel alive might be more useful for a future prisoner exchange that condemned to death.So he manages to to spare Rudolf Abel the death penalty.The climate was very tense in the United States and Donovan was attacked in the newspaper for saving the life of Abel.Some days later, Gary Powers, an U-2 pilot is captured in the Soviet Union.The CIA convinced Donovan to organize a exchange of spies and sent secretly Donovan to Berlin (for his family he was working in London).Donovan hears about a U.S. student Frederic Pryor who has been arrested in East-Berlin and against the opinions of the CIA and U.S. government he is insisting in exchange Abel againt Powers and Pryor.
Donovan was an ecellent negociator, he had this intelligence and tenacity for convincing Russian and East-German for the exchange.
The performances of Tom Hanks and Mrk Rylance are excellent: in these dramatic moments we feel a touch of humour that made this film more alive.",8,0,1,3 July 2019
Edward Scissorhands," A great tale of Tim Burton.
","Tim Burton create a little masterpiece where he combines fantasy, romantic drama and comedy.
Edwards Scissorhand, an artificial man, lands in a suburban neighbourhood where he is adopted by Peg: there is a very description of the neighbourhood and of the families.Little by little Edward begins to be part of this world and will fall in love with Kim, Peg's daughter.
The performance of Johnny is great, this helped him in his career.But we must also appreciate the performances of Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin and Bathy Baker.",8,0,0,9 November 2019
Die Hard 2," Panic in Dulles International airport.
","In my review on 'Die Hard' I describe the the beginning of a new action heroe: John Mc Clane played by Willis Willis.Besides Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone the USA have a new heroe: the very pleasant and tenacious policeman John Mc. Mc Clan.
In this film he has to fight against very hard terrorists and also to save the lives of a lot of passengers.
A very good mixture of dramatic and also funny moments.",7,0,0,30 July 2019
Saving Private Ryan," A hudge film !!
","Saving Private Ryan tells an interesting story: the rescue of a young American soldier because his other brothers have died during the second world war.
But this film seems too hudge : 2 hours and 49 minutes for telling the story !!
A great description of these first days of the Allied troops in Normandy and then the long research of the private Ryan.Steven Spielberg could have made a shorter film !!
About performances great names with good acting: Tom hanks, Matt Damon. Tom Sizemore.Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Gionani Ribisi, Ted Danson !!
Finally this film seems me quite overrated: maybe because of the presence of these famous actors, maybe for some dramatic sequences showing the difficulties of the disembarkation.",7,2,6,16 July 2019
The Game," When Nicholas Van Orton becomes crazy.
","The game is very good suspense story.Nicholas von Orton ,a wealthy banker, bings to have serious problems,his bank accounts have been closed, he runs through the town looking for help, he meets a mysterious girl, he awakes in Mexico without his documents, a true nightmare.At the end we know what does happen with Nicholas Vn Orton (the explanation is in the title of the film).
Maybe is one the best films of Michael Douglas, but also the performances of Deborah Kara Unger (Christine), James Rebhorn (Jim Feingold) and Sean Penn (Conrad Van Orton) are very good.",8,0,1,20 November 2019
The Imitation Game," Enigma and the Imitation Game.
","In 2001 Michael Apted directed the film 'Eigma' based on the novel of the same name of Robert Harris.The character of 'Thomas Jericho' played by Dougray Scott is inspired by the mathematician Alain Turing.
The Imitation Game goes further in the descrption of how Alain Turing and his colleagues managed to break down the Enigma code.This time the name of Alain Turing is written in big letters and is worthy of all the honours for his great contribution.
The Imitation game is a fascinating story, a run against the time for decoding the German military code.
Finally the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch is really great, but the performances of Matthew Goode, Keira Knightley and other actors are very good.",8,0,0,24 September 2019
Groundhog Day," A very funny comedy
","This film is really a masterpiece of fantasy and comedy.Bill Murray is absolutly fabulous in his role of Phil Connors who is obliged to cover for the fourth time the event and suddenly is living the same day over and over again.Andie MacDowell is also fabulous in her role of Rita, which is surprised by Phil's behavior !!
I enjoyed very much this film, I laughed for so much comic and also tragicomic situtations the characters were living in this small town.
Thanks also Mr. Harold Ramis for this very funny comedy !!",8,1,1,9 May 2019
"McFarland, USA"," A great movie.
","This film is based on the true story of James 'Jim' White, a cross-country coach in McFarlan, from 1987 to 2003 his country-cross team won nine state championships in Divisions III and IV.
The fact that the film is based on a true film gives him a very special strength.
Besides I envoy very sports movies in which young men or women are showing the best of themselves (self-improvement).
McFarland USA is also a film about the friendship: little by little Jim and his family will know the Latino families (eating enchiladas, celebrating 15 years feast for example).",9,0,0,11 May 2020
Glory Road," Based on a true story
","'Glory Road' is a very good basketball movie based on a true story.Don Haskins becomes coach of the Texas Western Miners and takes a very important decision: to integrate in the basketball team African American players.Little by little his team will grow: the climate is very heavy for Don Haskins: threats to his family, beating of a player, vandalism of his team's motel rooms.Nevertheless the team players will give the best of themselves to get the championship.'Glory Road is also a film about friendship, friendship between Don Haskins and his players and above all firendship between the players !!
I enjoyed very much the performances of Josh Lucas,Derek Luke, Mehcad Brooks and Jon Voight.",8,0,0,16 May 2020
Die Hard," A new action heroe !!
","Let's make a travel in the seventies and eighties !! We have in the USA two actors: Sylvester Stallone who begins his career with Rocky (1976),Rocky II (1979), Rocky III(1982), First Blood (1982), Rambo,first Blood II (1985) and Rocky IV (1985).And Arnold Schwarzenegger,some years later with Terminator (1984),Preadtor 1987 and Red Heat (1988).
Bruce Willis begin really his career with 'Moonlightning' where he plays a detective role.Then comes a good comedy 'Blid date' with Kim Bassinger.
And then comes in 1988 'Die Hard' directed by John Mc Tiernan.All know the story of this film.And it's a great success !!
A new action action heroe has born: it's name is John Clane, a very tenacious policeman,who will fight against terrorists in a great building.
From then begins the Die Hard saga with Bruce Willis: Die Hard 2:die harder (1990), Die Hard with a vengeance (1995) and two others films more.
Altough I prefer 'Die hard with a vengeance' I enjoyed very much 'Die Hard'
for the story (a real thriller) and for the good performances of the main actors.",8,0,0,30 July 2019
Downfall," The last days of the Third Reich and Bruno Ganz
","On February 16, 2019 died the famous Swiss actor Bruno Ganz and many of us will remember always his brilliant performance of Bruno Ganz.
Der Untergang is one of the few films in which the character of Adolf Hitler is largely described and is also the principal character of the film.
This film is based on the testimony of Traudl Junge who was the last secretary of Adolf Hitler and shows us Adolf Hitler, at the same time enthusiast and also totally depressed.
Last comment: der Untergang is a full German film ,made by a German director and with German actors and actresses (except of course Bruno Ganz, but German people appreciate so much his performances that they considered him as a German actor) !!
Der Undergang is an excellent historical film.",8,1,1,29 May 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The chemistry between John Mc Clane and Zeus Carver.
","As I mentioned in my review about 'Die Hard', Die Hard : With a vengeance' is my favorite film of the Die Hard saga.
John Mc Clane has become the new action action in the U.S. cinema !! His films have had a great success: this policeman with a great tenacity has seduced a lot of people not only in the U.S.A. but also in a lot of other countries.
But his film is even more interesting, because Bruce Willis is working with Samuel L. Jackson, a great action actor.And then we can notice the chemistry between John Mc Clane and Zeus Carver, respectively between Bruuce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson !! This simple thing makes this film more interesting and dynamic !!
I have written too much about Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. I forget to mention Jeremy Irons, a very good actor !!
In conclusion 'Die Hard with a vengeance is a very good action film.",8,0,0,30 July 2019
Con Air," A good thriller.
","Con Air is a good story with a lot of suspense.I enjoyed this film because of the great actors we see in it: Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich (often he is the bad of the movie), Stan Buscemi , Rachel Ticotin and some others.
Its a complete film: a film with a lot of action, dramatic moments,but also a touch of humour.
The pérformances of Nicolas Cage, John Cusack,John Malvovich and SteverBuscemi are good.",7,0,0,3 July 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," The story of a friendship.
","The Shawshank Redemption is a great film, because it's a touching story about the life in a terrible jail.Andy Dufresne has been accused of the murder of his wife and her lover and has been sentenced to 20 years of jail altough he was innocent.Then begins his slow adaptation to this new and hard world.But he will meet Red, a very quiet and clevar prisoner and begins a new friendship which will help them to survive in this universe.With a lot of patience and intelligence Andy will prepare his escape.
Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are really extraordinary actors: they give to the film a great strength, dramatism and suspense.",9,0,0,9 November 2019
Before Sunrise," Céline and Jesse.
","Vienna is a very beautiful town.Maybe the best place for one night in which two young persons spend a nice time together, know each other and may fall in love.
Before Sunrise is a pleasant film about the encounter of a young American man and a young French woman in the train from Budapest to Vienna: then Jesse proposes to spend the night in Vienna together.I know Vienna and I enjoyed their walk through the city (restaurant, music, palm , bookshop ,etc).The end of this story remains open: will they meet again or not ?
The performance of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are really very good.",8,0,0,26 September 2019
The Truman Show," A masterpiece of Peter Weir.
","Peter Weir has imagined the most crazy reality show in the life of the television: since his birth Truman Burbank is observed everyday by millions of spectators: the master of this show, Christof remembers me curiously of the Big Brother of Orwell where the life of the citizen is invaded by the Big Brother.Christof decides what is good and what is bad for Truman.But maybe one day Truman will escape from him.
What to say about the performance of Jim Carrey ? He shows in the film that he is a great comedian.Ed Harris doesn't need any presentation, he has been and remains a very good actor.",8,1,1,2 December 2019
All the President's Men," A very good film
","Based on the real story of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward we live an important moment of othe political life of the United States of America; a great investigation beginning with the Watergate and leading to the resignation of Richard Nixon.The film shows how these two journalists fight to obtain the best information about this political scandal.
