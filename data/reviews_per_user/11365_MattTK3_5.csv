Casablanca," This one has it all!
","**Spoiler**  This movie has it all; literally.  The combination of several film genres in its outstanding story make this film one of the best. There are alot of visual metaphors and symbolism throughout as well.  Consider the fact that Bogart's character Rick represents the social and military isolationism of the US prior to the war and how he changes to making sacrifices for the good of the cause.  'The lives of 2 human beings don't add up to a hill of beans' so he gives her up for the greater good. That's Hollywood telling us that we need to sacrifice in our personal lives in order to fight for the greater good.  There is so much to say about this film, especially the hidden meanings behind it.  You'll be hard pressed to find a flaw with this film.  Masterful direction, acting, and storytelling. *****/*****",10,2,2,7 July 2003
Citizen Kane," Just to mention a few things that haven't been said already about this Great Film!
","*****Major Spoilers Ahead*****   Seriously, don't read this unless you've seen the film!!!!!
Citizen Kane is a film that I have seen maybe 20 times and I am always amazed at how many new things I see with each viewing.  As a film student, I studied this film for 4 different classes and each class showed me different ways of viewing it.  After my second viewing, my first professor told me that there were TWO meanings for Rosebud, not just the obvious one and our assignment was to figure it out using a semiotic approach.  I would never have guessed that the second meaning was Susan Alexander's clitoris!  Nope, I'm not kidding.  Watch it again and see how subtly it is implied.  This is actually a nickname that William Randolph Hearst (the man Kane is based on) had for his mistress' clitoris.  See 'RKO 281' (1999) for more about this as well as 'The Cat's Meow' (2001) for more about Hearst/Kane.The shots are so carefully constructed and relate so well to the themes of the story, with each one telling you a lot about Kane's character.  For example, during the newsreel, Kane gets wet concrete on his jacket and the camera suddenly cuts without changing angles and the concrete disappears; this relates to how his character hides his weaknesses.  This is a subtle way for Kane to cover this up, yet this is left just apparent enough for the film audience to understand what Kane did to the newsreel.  Yes, this newsreel was constructed after Kane's death, yet it is footage captured while he was alive and since Kane would never allow that to be seen and has a monopoly on the media, he had it cut from the original footage.  You all may be thinking that I am reading way to far into this film, however these are all things that I learned in college.  There are some films for which you really need an education in fine arts to appreciate many aspects of them.  The story itself can get tiresome, but it is not the story that really makes this film one of the greatest; it is how well the Director conveys his ideas.  'The less obviously a filmmaker reveals his intentions, the better the film.'   This applies for art films such as this, but not for junk like 'Half-Baked.'  This is a film that uses the language of images, not so much the plot, to convey its ideas.  Masterful direction, storytelling, and performances.  They just don't get better than this! *****/*****",10,1,3,13 July 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," An Emotionally Powerful Film
",***Spoiler Ahead***  This movie evoked more emotion out of me than almost any other movie.  I nearly cried at the end and left feeling furious at that cold-hearted nurse.  Jack Nicholson played his role to a T and we can see how much a strong actor can bring to a difficult role (Just imagine if it were James Caan like it was supposed to be).  I had not read the book before viewing the film and the book is more ambiguous than the film in that it makes it more difficult to determine whether Randle is crazy or not.  The cruelty of nurse Ratched (or Wretched as I like to call her) makes her one of the most sinister villains I've ever seen in a film.  You can sense her utter hatred of Randle and and she is exceptionally well-portrayed by Louise Fletcher.  If only more movies could evoke this much emotion from an audience as this one did from me.  A Masterwork.  *****/*****,10,1,2,15 July 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Exceptional Filmmaking
","This is wonderful filmmaking filled with gut-wrenching emotion and drama. I do not agree that this is the 2nd greatest movie of all time.  Perhaps it belongs in the top 50.  This film as well as Director Frank Darabont's follow-up The Green Mile are based on Stephen King short stories and I honestly cannot say that one is better than the other.  Masterful direction, acting, and storytelling.  I am very, very particular about the films that I give a perfect score.  I go for more thought-provoking plots rather than well-told melodramas like Titanic.  This is certainly an excellent film with its triumph of the human spirit theme and I believe that it is worthy of a 9.  Excellent film experience.  ****1/2 / *****",9,0,1,7 July 2003
The Godfather," A near-perfect film.
","Believe me, for those don't have attention spans, this is a movie that is worth trying to overcome that shortcoming.  You won't be disappointed.  I was lucky enough to see this recently at the new American Film Institute's Silver Theatre and Cultural Center where I work.  Amazing.  The DVD set has some great extra features.  Also, look for the 'ghostly figure' of Coppola during the funeral scene.  *****/*****",10,0,2,7 July 2003
