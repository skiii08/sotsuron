First Man," Fragmented & dull, I don't get the hype.
","I like space films. This one was so boring however that I was tempted to walk out of the cinema and do literally anything else. What brought it up from a 3/10 to a 4/10 was the scene on the moon which was nicely done. The rest was disconnected, and I didn't care about the characters or plot.",4,28,51,14 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Exceeded the hype!!
","I don't know anyone who saw this and didn't like it, so had to see if it lived up to the hype. It certainly did and more.Even if this isn't usually your type of film you should still see it. It's not my favourite genre and it's at least a 7 or 8/10 for me!It's really well shot, really well acted, it's a great story and it's so funny and so sad- you'll bawl your eyes out. Enjoy!",8,0,2,13 January 2019
Climax," Pretentious and unpleasant. Critics love that stuff.
","4/10. And this is from someone who likes weird and/or controversial films including some of Noé's previous ones.The film had some nice shots. And it was pretty original. That's the only good about it.Of course the film isn't supposed to be pleasant (and I expected that from previous Noé films) but this was just hellish. You'll tell me it's art and it gave me an experience of emotions, forget that! There's not much of a plot here. The chapter titles were pretentious. In fact the whole film is. Critics out there are as pretentious as this film.A lot of the scenes are just trying to shock audiences. And the dialogue wasn't great either. E.g. a guy going on about how he loves anal and how huge his dong is. I like it when the dialogue is interesting, not when it's completely pointless as part of the film.",4,1,5,17 February 2019
The Favourite," Lacking in plot with a very unsatisfying ending
",Highly overrated:The script was amusing at times with the biting comments and characters behaving badly. Also the visuals were impressive- good cinematography.But overall that doesn't matter when it's a tedious film with a lame finish. Wouldn't watch again- a slightly below average 4/10.,4,1,6,1 January 2019
It Follows," Solid horror let down a bit by the ending.
","I was going to give this film a 7/10. It's really engrossing, has good performances and is well shot. But the ending is such a let down- why didn't they go through with their plan?! Even though there was a cloud of blood in the pool they should still logically go through with the electrocution. Oh well, knocked it down to a 6/10. Still worth checking out!",6,0,0,15 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 7 or 8
","Can't decide between 7 and 8! Good stuff.
Check it",7,2,3,22 August 2019
Mystic River," Gripping, good performances, but bad writing.
","It kept me watching, Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon are good to watch as usual.The story isn't good however. Massively overrated film. The final 10 minutes in particular were cringeworthy- so badly written it was painful.",4,0,1,9 November 2018
