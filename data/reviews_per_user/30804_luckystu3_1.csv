Hereditary," Not worth the hype
","I saw this movie last night and was really looking forward too it after all its reviews.
However,the premise is a good idea and it does have you on the edge of your seat a couple of times,but that ending man,it was like the film was overunning and they didn't have an ending in mind,so to finish it off quickly they totally spoilt the whole film.
This is better than the witch but only just.",4,1,3,22 June 2018
