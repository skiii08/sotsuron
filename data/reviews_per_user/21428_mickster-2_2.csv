Requiem for a Dream," A fantastic piece of filmmaking-GENUINE-not for weak stomachs though...
","I had the pleasure of meeting Darren Aronofsky at a Hollywood awards event. I didn't know him from atom and only knew I was talking to this guy from Brooklyn, about my age. He was the most genuine person I ever met in Hollywood. We just chatted about this and that. I am not part of Hollywood-but he didn't care.This film is protrayed as genuine as genuine can get in film. If you've ever known an addict-whether pot, coke, heroin, pills, alcohol, coffee, sex, money etc., you will realize how true the portrayals, direction and story really is.The acting is real-Marlon Wayans stands out-as does Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto. The direction is perfect. The visuals give you all the feeling of what it is like when the rush of the high begins...The paranoia, the self-delusion, the seedy side-the criminal-it all stands as real.Hubert Selby Jr. is the author of the book and co-screenwriter. His book is done justice. I plan to go out and buy all of his books. I suggest you rent the DVD-with the director's commentary-and be prepared to have your mind blown. There are some gruesome sex and medical scenes so be warned.Note to film buffs: As you know, Darren Aronofsky wrote and directed Pi-a brilliant film as well (as this Jewish Migraine sufferer who loves math can attest to....)---Watch carefully in the later scenes when one of the PA's has a clipboard in his hand with the greek letter 'Pi' on the back-a nice homage to the director's last film...As jaded as I have been about each of the recent Batman films (since 1989), I will make sure to see Darren Aronofsky's direction and interpretation of the next Batman film. I think he will get the dark side.",10,0,0,28 May 2001
Any Given Sunday," A great, long look at professional sports today
","You've seen this film before-at least the basic plot-this is an accurate portrayal of life in sports today-in this case football. It is ironically accurate, yet it has a Hollywoodness about it that is not typical Oliver Stone.Lawrence Taylor is stellar in his role here-Oliver Stone got an Oscar-worthy performance out of him. And Jamie Foxx-man he can be funny on TV-but here he shows HE CAN ACT-also Oscar worthy.Great acting all around.You probably need to be a football fan to follow-or have a basic understanding of sports as both a form of entertainment and a business.",10,2,4,24 December 1999
