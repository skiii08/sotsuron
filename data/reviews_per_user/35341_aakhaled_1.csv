The Devil's Advocate," Every success has its price!
","Every time I think of all the great things I am going to do to get my career going, be competitive, show the world, etc. I am reminded of this movie which very carefully shows us what could be the price of going for it a little bit too much.It is important to strive for success, the fast track, and to get to the top but we should always remember that the higher we get, the harder we are likely to fall.And the price to get there cannot be obtained, or rather shouldn't be obtained, by selling our souls!",8,0,0,21 October 2000
