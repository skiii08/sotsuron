1917," Fabulous film, a little PC

The King," Hugely inaccurate - sack the director
","I only watched it for the battlescene, which was woefully inaccurate compared to eye witness accounts and piecing together by battlefield detectives. The longbow, as a decisive weapon barely got a mention and barely featured. Watch YouTube instead. What a waste of time!!",1,14,22,18 November 2019
Love Actually," Overpaid lefty politically correct Luvvies doing what they do best
