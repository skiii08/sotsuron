Kill Bill: Vol. 2," We meet 'Bill' at last. He's still in love with her.
","Volume I blew us away. In Vol II, we all get gathered in to hear the rest of the story.I know why Beatrix was in love with Bill...it's his voice, and the way he tells a story. Nevermind that he is a self-proclaimed 'murdering bastard', and he is nurturing the talents of a 'natural-born killer', they are in love. We all know that you can't help who you love.Anyway, Quentin makes a double right angle turn away from the full on gory slashing frenzy of KB I, and sends us down into American Ravine Revenge; to an incomparable gunman with a pearl handled revolver, on lonely dusty red roads, with no-good-down-at-the-heels brother, viciously jealous second banana girlfriend, and, always, the Woman who continually asks her question...'where's Bill?'. And on down into Mexico for an amazing encounter with Bill's mentor, the unforgettable Esteban.And that's not all, folks. The best is yet to come and couldn't possibly be guessed.I said it before...Quentin's talent is lush and he is extremely generous to us. He chose the music which is an absolute miracle.Couldn't be better. Thank you, Quentin. I love you.",10,2,4,24 January 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Grizzled grandpa coaches 9 year old granddaughter for pageant
","A film about a family, but not a family film. I went to see it because the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant was supposed to be in Redondo Beach, California, and I once lived in Redondo Beach. Thought I might see some my old haunts. That's my excuse.I surely had a bad taste in my mouth after seeing the little girl's 'talent' performance coached by the salacious, tourettes tendencied, now thankfully dead (overdosed on heroin), dirty old grandpa-man who, evidently completely unsupervised and behind closed doors in the basement, teaches the adorable 9 year old Abigail to do a striptease/bump and grind for her beauty pageant performance. Remembering back to some of his early comments and advice to the men in the party, I did not want to think about whatever else he might have been introducing to his innocent granddaughter.Anyway, my hopes for this 'road' movie, with its outstanding ensemble cast, were busted.1 out of 10 for this dreary, hopeless, grimy little film.",1,14,45,2 September 2006
Mulholland Drive," Oh lord, when is this movie going to be over?

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Whatever you expect is exceeded exponentially!
","Beatrix Kiddo has some unfinished business ('Baby, you ain't kidding') with several of her former co-workers, and she needs some special equipment to do the job, so she flies to Okinawa to enlist the aid of the finest sword maker in the world, now 20 years retired. Upon learning the name of her arch enemy, he immediately comes out of retirement.When Hattori Hanzo presents her with his 'finest' sword, he says that 'god will be cut'.I say that Quentin is(a)god, and I know he loves me because he made the 'Kill Bill's just for me. Quentin, you can believe me when I say your talent is lavish and vast.I am your perfect viewer, Quentin...I saw the movie(s)several times, and paid full ticket price + I bought the DVDs, ++ I bought the soundtrack(s), and I can't stop talking about them! About the music...sheer genius. It makes me so happy! Thank you! SEE THESE MOVIES",10,2,5,24 January 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Brilliantly heartwarming, glowing
","This movie is like being in love...you can't stop smiling. The ingenious Coens have made another sweetheart of a film. Usually, when I leave a movie this happy, it's a love story. This is a kind of goofy buddy movie with charming, unexpected performances from everybody. Three convicts escape, have meeting with fortune teller/seer, make a record, get caught, escape, meet a famous bank robber, meet beautiful women, get caught, escape (and each escape is more poetic than the last), discover that their treasure has been betrayed, become a famous singing group (and they don't even know it)by virtue of their recording...and on and on. This film is fascinating, funny, freedom loving, and fine. The director's vision with perfectionist cinematography flood the audience with golden images, creating a nimbus of timeless radiance.But wait! There is more! The Music. So much fun and expertly done. I have new laugh lines on my face. I almost don't mind.",10,0,0,26 April 2001
