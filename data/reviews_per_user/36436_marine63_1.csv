Alien 3," ALIEN 3 MOVIE SHORT MINI REVIEW
","In 1995, I saw Alien 3 for the first time on FOX as a movie premiere for the network. I was a pretty big fan for the series but when I saw this I thought this movie was the motive and the weapon that help The Alien saga to commit suicide. I have bought the Alien Legacy about an year ago, but ever since the purchase I have never opened the Alien 3 movie cause of the bad memory of it. Recently I have seen it once again and this time I paid real good attention of the movie's ideas, background, settings, and the character's interaction and dialogue. After I have seen I was pretty amazed of what I saw. The setting/background is awesome, the story plot fits.(I have some of the other reviews and they were questioning the idea of how the egg got on the Sulaco. I got this reason from a book of facts on Aliens, but I have came to two conclusions. Aliens can carry their eggs, so that they can plant them strategically in spots to form a colony. Another was that during a emergency or a crisis and queen alien can lay eggs without the huge thing hanging from her butt, but only can lay very few.)Another reason why this movie is good is because it shows more character development for Ripley. This movie also showed more things about the Aliens Universe such as, more sight and concerns about the Company and their involvement and the way aliens work. Please I urge you to watch it again but this time don't look for action but look for the art of the story and director. I suggest to get the unedited version which shows more action and character development. Review Grade: 9 out of 10. DRAWBACKS:The theatrical release was heavily edited so they're were major drawbacks of the plot.",Null,0,3,14 December 2000
