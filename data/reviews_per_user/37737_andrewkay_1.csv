The Ring," I won't be surprised if theatergoers die of heart attack in the theater!!
","It's 12:31 am right now, and i just got back from seeing 'The Ring'. The movie scared the living crap out of me. The imagery and presentation was terrifying, and I may never sleep again! That being, the movie was masterful. Definately a must see.... if you don't like sleep, that is.",10,2,2,18 October 2002
