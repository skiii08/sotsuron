The Sound of Music," a classic film
","'When the Lord closes one door, he opens a window.' You don't have be be coming from an Abbey to know this is true. These are words to live by. Why don't movies like this exist anymore? :-( 'Nothing comes from nothing; nothing ever could, so somewhere in my youth I must have done something good.' I will also add that Captain van Trap looks strikingly like the Kevin Kline. I suppose that it's sad, but true, that life does not exist like this, and that no hills are alive with the sound of music, but when the Captain has a moment of self knowledge about music being brought back into their lives everything starts changing, and for the better. This proves we do need music in our lives, good music. (And a good looking Naval Captain wouldn't hurt either.)",10,2,8,17 December 2005
