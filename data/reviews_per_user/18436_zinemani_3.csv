The Blair Witch Project," The best horror movie in the 90's...or is it ever?
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a thruly amazing film, an effective machine of horror and despair, that, if you're willing to (because if you're not, it just doesn't work), it will disturb you. Great cast, specially the female lead (whose 'I'm so sorry' sequence is unforgettable) and very expert and inteligent construction of fear. Final ten minutes are hell on earth, specially the ending bit where... Along with 'Texas Chain Shaw Massacre' and 'John Carpenter's Halloween', 'The Blair Witch Project' is a must. Unfortunatly, it will be seen by too many people because of the publicity, and it will be stupidly hated, parodied, clones, imitated and...sequeled. No matter what people say to you, rent it or buy it (on DVD, because of the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' documentary), see it alone, in the dark, in late night, and willing to enjoy it. It is worth it. If you've already seen it...just see it again!",10,1,2,4 January 2000
The Mummy," Mummified crap
","It disappoints me how stupid american audiences can be. If a movie like THE MUMMY can reach 100 million, it means that cinema has rechead its lower level. The film is divided in two parts. The first is a boring and uninteresting character development (with failed intentions at comedy and drama). The second is pure and simple cinematic grave-robbering, only not directed by GUS VAN SANT. No new ideas, no new experiences, good visual effects wasted in pathetic storyline and tedious characters. If it's a horror movie, it is not frightenning. If it's a adventure movie, it's not exciting. If it's a comedy, it's not funny. If it's dramatic, well, it is pathetic. All the good scenes were in the trailer. Don't see it, it's a waste of time. Unless if you're dumb or controled by the media. Like all sucessful american movies, THE MUMMY is plain old dumb and totally unoriginal. 0.5 out of 5",1,7,19,19 July 1999
The Thing," Great movie, but still Carpenter's worst
","The beginning is awfully slow and boring, to the point of nodding you off completely. BUt when things start to move, and the killing begins, CARPENTER proves that he is still the guy who made 'Halloween' and 'The Fog'. The totally off-Hollywood conclusion gives it a fine touch.",8,0,1,2 January 2000
