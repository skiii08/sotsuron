Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Were the Critics expecting Fellini?
","My family went in with an open mind, not sure what to expect.  We were surprised that we loved it as much as we did.  Sure, the movie is not perfect, and they could have done a bit more with the characters, but we have to realize that the original characters are different people, and if we'd seen this movie first, we would have seen it through different eyes. It looked totally 'Star Wars' and had the same George Lukas look, and that's what we love. It set us up for part 2, & 3, and those will be great.  Give these characters a chance.  It's not Fellini!  It's Star Wars!",8,0,0,21 May 1999
The Mummy," So bad, it's good.
","I thought the acting was hokey, and it was trying to be an Indiana Jones rip-off, but it was so campy, it was actually a great popcorn movie. Thought I'd hate it, and I actually recommend it...",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
