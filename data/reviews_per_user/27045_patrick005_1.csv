The Blair Witch Project," this movie freaked me out
","NEVER have I been this terrified in a movie theatre.  The Blair Witch Project has got to be the scariest movie I've EVER seen.I've always complained how 'scary' movies nowadays always cheapens the suspense and horror of a scene by showing what is 'suppose' to be scary, and then it turns out it isn't. The reason would be because the one thing most everyone is scared of more than anything, is the unknown.
TBWP is all about feeling that chill in the back of your neck, turning around and see nothing, but know there HAS to be something there, and it can't be good.Because of this movie all the classic fears from childhood returns to hunt me as an adult (hopefully not for long).  The fear of the dark, the fear of strange noises you know nothing about, the fear of being lost in strange environments, the fear that the supernatural is real, the fear of being alone, the fear of being hunted, the fear of the unknown, and of course the fear of dying.Be warned I seriously believe that no one under the age of 17 should see this movie, unless you want them to have phobias for life.I believe I have a strong imagination and truly enjoy being engulfed by a movie experience, now I wish I didn't.'I just can't get that last scene out of my head, please help me.'",5,1,3,23 July 1999
