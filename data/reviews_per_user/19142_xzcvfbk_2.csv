Sucker Punch," Good on its way...
","The movie its just incredible talking about visual effects, unfortunately, the plot is not developed as it should be, the characters are not well described, in other words the film makes no sense.Indeed its something innovative, like modern cinema uses to be, less plot, more action, if you like the Otaku stuff, you won't get bored, otherwise you may fall asleep. If you thought Chuck Norris was invencible... you haven't met Baby Doll, that is a thing I didn't liked indeed, during all the movie you will not see even a scratch on the girlsEven though the message is good... Fight for your survivalDefinitely Snyder could have done a better Sucker Punch...",8,0,1,19 March 2012
The Hunger Games," Not a good adaptation... But a very, very proper teenagers film
","Being realistic, they took a Rated R book, a story about an oppressive and extremely capitalist government, and they made it commercial, just like that, PG 13.Im 14 years old and I was dragged to the movie, I knew they had made it like this, commercial, I was expecting another twilight but instead of that I found out this is game changer for teenage films.The movie shows a lot of things about the human, we eat, or we wait for someone to eat us; and how can we people fight for our rights and against the oppression.In my opinion, it was quite good, if you are not expecting a perfect adaptation from the book, you won't get disappointed.",8,5,17,24 March 2012
