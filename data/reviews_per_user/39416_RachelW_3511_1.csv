The Longest Yard," What was Burt doing there?
","I love Adam Sandler and I see everything he's in. 50 First Dates in my favorite movie and even Punch Drunk Love makes me tingle. So I was really looking forward to seeing Adam strut his stuff in The Longest Yard. You know, Inspiring the troops. and then there was Burt. It seemed like they took the one role and divided it into two. Adam was left totally in the cold. I wanted him to make it happen but he couldn't because Burt was doing it all. And he did nothing for me. I wish that Adam had been the quarter back, the coach and the lead all by himself. The rest of the supporting cast was great. Chris Rock was charming as always and the other football players were all sufficiently meat-necked and stupid to be entertaining. But that doesn't make a movie for me. I come to see a star do what they do. I would give this an angry three... but I love Adam too much to score one of his pics so low. As a side car...... thank God Adam's goofy friend was only in one scene. He is too weird for me.",7,1,11,5 June 2005
