Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as people say
","A lot of reviewers really gave this movie a good reeming.  In my opinion, most of them went in expecting the ultimate prequel to the original three, and were let down.  If you just go in and expect a good summer movie, you'll be pleased.",7,0,0,25 February 2000
