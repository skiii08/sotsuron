Casablanca," 'I stick my head out for nobody.'
","Michael Curtiz's masterpiece, Casablanca, is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The plot brilliantly demonstrates self sacrifice and ever- lasting love in a way that is untraditional and completely original. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman have amazing chemistry that really brings the story to life. The lighting is perfect and natural, despite being filmed in a studio, the dialog has a good rhythm, and the composition was spot on. The image appeared to be very crisp and clear with no imperfections. The sets and prop designs were beautiful with a truly authentic Moroccan style. The flashbacks were very well shot and utilized effectively, there were a few comparison shots that were well thought out. Overall Casablanca is a movie far beyond its time that will be forever loved and respected.",9,2,3,13 November 2014
Citizen Kane," 'If I hadn't been rich, I might have been a really great man.'
","Citizen Kane is truly a masterpiece in American cinema. Orson Wells artistic abilities and beautiful cinematography have made Citizen Kane a very successful and critically acclaimed film. The acting is terrific and the and the suspense building up in the film was fantastic. The lighting was dramatic without being too over the top. Its very interesting how Wells uses low camera angles to make the central characters seem absurdly tall, this is a very successful technique. The ending was outstanding and very satisfying. Who knew that so much suspense could lead up to a single word uttered by a dying man. Overall a very good movie even 73 years later.",8,1,2,13 December 2014
Taxi Driver," 'Loneliness has followed me my whole life.'
","One of Robert De Niros best movies, Taxi Driver is a classic tale of a Vietnam war veteran who becomes a taxi driver. Martin Scorsese has brilliantly created a film about morality and kindness existing in the most unexpected places. The cast is top notch and Jodie Fosters performance is flawless and De Niro portrays a mentally ill veteran with ease. The story is very action packed and edgy and the cinematography is very well done. The natural lighting works well and the film has a good score. Overall a great psychological film about the journey of a eccentric man and his goal of leading a young girl on the right path. A must see for any Scorsese fan.",8,1,4,13 December 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," 'I'd pray for folks that's alive and don't know which way to turn.'
","The first time I watched this film I was in middle school and were watching it to learn about the dust bowl and the migration of farmers. I thought it was boring and dry however upon watching it later in life I came to appreciate the portrayal of a poor family struggling to survive after having lost everything. The story more than anything, is about family and perseverance. The film was visually pleasing, the natural light was good, the camera angles were good, the editing was good, and the score was well made. The acting was phenomenal and very touching. I realize now that it took me growing up and experiencing life to truly understand the meaning of this film.",7,0,1,13 December 2014
Annie Hall," 'Don't like to show my body to a man of my gender.'
","Annie hall has become one of my favorite films about love and relationships because of its level of realism and accuracy. Woody Allen successfully captures the essence of love and how people can grow apart. The film is hilariously funny yet also somber at points because of the sad truth of it all. Diane Keaton's performance as charmingly awkward is spectacular. The film, while long, moves at a good pace though it does seem to drag at times. Allen successfully breaks the rules of movie making resulting in a very unique movie experience. The audience members become participants in Allen's journey. Overall Annie Hall is a must see for any romance fanatics, it may not be what you expected but instead what you needed.",8,0,1,13 December 2014
The Graduate," 'I think you're the most attractive of all my parents friends.'
","A spectacular coming of age film that brilliantly characterizes adulthood and life after college. Mike Nichols successfully creates a hilariously awkward film. Dustin Hoffman did very well in portraying his quirky and naive character but there's no question that Anne Bancroft as Msr. Robinson really stole the spotlight in this movie. Her performance as the sex-craved, alcoholic, house wife is astonishingly authentic and enjoyable to watch. The scenes between her and Hoffman are quite possibly the best in the entire film. The cinematography was very artistically done with several interesting shots, such as the underwater shots and the transitional montage. The ending was amazing and enjoyable, it made the whole film for me. overall a very successful coming of age story.",8,0,0,9 December 2014
Singin' in the Rain," 'What do you think I am, dumb or something !?'
","Stanely Donen and Gene Kelly have created a masterpiece and a classical American film with Singin' In the Rain. The film is charmingly funny and witty, and the chemistry between Gene Kelley and Debbie Reynolds is phenomenal. The elaborate choreography as well as the stunts are flawlessly executed. The acrobatics in the 'Make em' Laugh' performance were especially impressive and energetic. The three- part Technicolor is amazingly crisp and vibrant and the transitional scenes are smooth. The sound is clear and the score fits the film perfectly. The finishing performance by Gene Kelly dragged on for quite some time and became a bit off putting though other than that it was a successful movie.",8,0,1,9 December 2014
Pulp Fiction," 'English mother f***er, do you speak it ?!'
","One of my favorite films of all time however my opinion is bias because I love Quentin Tarrantino. The film is set up in chapters much with an out of order story line thats very interesting to following. It is a dark humor so it's not for everyone. The acting is phenomenal, Samuel L Jackson is hilarious and Uma Thurman is spectacular. The Score was very beautifully made and the cinematography was spectacular. Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you didn't know you wanted to see until you actually sit down and watch it. The plot is very unique and interesting. Overall a great movie, one of Tarrantino's best films and one of my favorites.",9,0,2,14 December 2014
Psycho," 'We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you ?'
","Easily one of my all time favorite movies. Hitchcook never disappoints and Psycho is no exception. The story is very simple and straight forward with a great twist at the end that catches audience members by surprise ( although I wasn't so easily fooled. Hitchcook using several foreshadowing techniques and focused shots to push the audience towards a conclusion. His shots, while often simple, are very effective; for example the low lighting and the back-lit people allows the audience to see the outline of the killer but no specific details beyond that. The shower seen was especially brilliant with a wide variety of rapid shots and insinuated actions. Overall the film is amazingly made and a stepping stone for all psycho thrillers to come.",9,1,2,9 December 2014
