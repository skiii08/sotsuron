The Lobster," Confused and confusing
","The movie begins quite intelligibly, though any intelligent viewer will soon begin to wonder how the basic directive is to be enforced without substantial armed force. As the film moves out of the hotel into the world outside, however, it becomes ever more confused and confusing.The director seems to be making a fundamentally misanthropic statement: human relationships of love are either not possible or not permitted. I'm by no means sure that this is the director's intention or concept, however. The film reminds me of more than one opera I have seen on German stages, where the director dresses up an obscure concept with all kinds of strange touches whose purpose seems to be to mystify the audience. Some of the performances in this film are good, but as a whole 'The Lobster' wastes those performances in the service of a seriously confused premise.",2,18,29,7 May 2016
The Usual Suspects," Well acted but the script is manipulative and implausible
","Why many people think so highly of The Usual Suspetcs is a mystery. I'll give it 6 out of 10 because of some fine performances, most notably Kevin Spacey's, but as a whole the thing is a violence-filled mess. The ending simply does not follow from the film and seems to have been dragged in to resolve a problem that is not all that interesting to begin with. The editing is also confusing; without seeing it at least a second time it is hard to make sense of what has happened when. Throughout the film we are led to believe that the character played by Gabriel Byrne is central to the plot, only to discover at the end that he is not. To put it succinctly: this film cheats the viewer. Don't trust the judgment of anybody who tells you that this is a great or even a good film.",6,3,4,4 February 2012
