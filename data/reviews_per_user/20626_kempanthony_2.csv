Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," One to miss
","Saw this way after it came out. I had avoided it as the trailer seemed quite rediculous. But, fate steered me to watching it and so I hoped it would be a tongue in cheek comedy satire. Sadly its not. Its just terrible. The acting is fine. The script is awful and the cgi is carelessly obvious. Its not the worst movie i have seen but you do wonder what the point was when it finally dissolves to an ending. And once it is over you find yourself debating whether to sell the blu ray or give it to charity. Because this is a movie you will watch just once.",3,1,2,28 June 2018
Suicide Squad," Simply Awful
","I love watching super hero movies.Sadly, the only thing worth watching in this movie is Harley Quinn's rear end. Which, oddly enough, has more time on the screen than some of the casts faces.By the end of the movie, I could understand why. It is the best part of this movie.The story falls apart before it begins, is diabolically written and ends just in time for you to not hang yourself with your own underwear.Why do they make such terrible movies? Of course, you will watch this movie anyway, because you are also a fan of comics. Like me.I wonder if anyone else thought it reminded them of the original Ghost Busters movie?",3,1,1,11 June 2017
