Scarface," Solid but over rated
","When one thinks of an epic crime film many consider Scarface a 'great movie'. But, to me that isn't the case. It has entertaining qualities but really doesn't have the cinematography or dialog to live up to Goodfellas or the Godfather (part 1 and part 2). Al Pacino does a very good job but he really is the only top name actor in this movie. Rather than developing the story he almost automatically becomes a driving force in Miami. Which to me is totally unrealistic. The dialog is mediocre at best. There is no true acting it, is just a non-stop Al Pacino being angry the entire time. I enjoyed certain parts of Scarface but it is a very overrated movie.",6,1,3,13 June 2006
