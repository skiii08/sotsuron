The Blair Witch Project," Scary ending, too much strong language
","The movie is really boring, but its ending is more effectively scary than anything I've seen in recent movies. But the profanity is a menace ---by the time Heather was explaining that she hated Scotch, I'd had enough of the language---for artistic rather than moral reasons.",Null,0,1,25 February 2001
Mission: Impossible II," This is an obligatory experience at the movies
",This movie takes no cinematic talent to make. The plot turns are obvious from the very beginning. The movie is riddled with '90s movie cliches. This action-adventure film in name only turns out to be merely a parody of modern movies.,Null,0,0,22 August 2000
Titanic," I had to force myself to watch this
","I could not stand most of this film. It is like attending a movie you didn't want to see but did see just so you'd look hip. There's plenty of movies that are no less hip but are far better than this one.I don't mind seeing the female anatomy in movies, but the way they did it was obviously economic as opposed to artistic. And don't we have enough movies in the 1990s about the turn-of-the-century with colorless settings? I really didn't like tying myself down to this cinematic garbage for at least two hours, just to be hip or to see the beloved ship-sinking scene.",Null,2,4,5 August 2000
