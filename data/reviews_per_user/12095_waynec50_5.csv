Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Weakest POTC Yet
","Depp and McShane are always entertaining, but this movie isn't even close. Cruz is like Puss In Boots from 'Shrek' in human female form. Keith Richard is ridiculous, as usual. This might be about two hours but feels like two years. Rush is possibly the best thing in the movie, but he's really underused. The plot concerns the Fountain of Youth and somehow all these characters chase each other around with occasional sword fight to relieve the tedium. The battles are well staged, but the story is incoherent and silly. Depp gives his usual performance, giving more to the role than it deserves, the same is true for Rush and McShane, Cruz is blah. Worst one yet, but surely there's another coming along.",4,1,2,22 May 2011
Walk the Line," Very good biopic
","'Walk The Line' is a fine biopic, detailing the rise, rough times and redemption of American music icon, Johnny Cash, and his pursuit and eventual winning of June Carter. Both leads are phenomenal in their roles. Joaquin Phoenix portrays Johnny as he grows from wide eyed country music novice through the early days of recording and touring to his melt down on stage in Las Vegas to his arrest on drug related charges to his his marriage to June, without missing a beat (to use a musical clich√©). Reese Witherspoon is a revelation to those of us who've only seen her in bubbly comedy roles, doing an incredible job as June. Also featured in the film are some of the greats of the 50's rock and roll revolution, Elvis, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis, who toured with June and Johnny. The concert scenes make you feel like a witness to the performances. This movie is a must see for Johnny Cash/early rock and roll fans. It's a faithful retelling of June and Johnny's courtship. 9 stars.",9,2,4,5 March 2006
Meet the Parents," Predictable waste of talent
","If you've ever watched a TV sitcom of the last thirty years or so, you can see just about every punch line for a mile. Robert DeNiro should have made his comedic debut in something original or at least funnier. He has a couple of good lines and has good chemistry with Blythe Danner. Ben Stiller is given pointless and stupid stuff throughout the movie and really makes no connection with Teri Polo, Owen Wilson would go much better with her. The usual drug references and literal potty humor are uninspired, it's as if the writers gathered around some inane sitcom scripts and padded them with this stuff that wouldn't be allowed on TV. A really weak effort, but at least it's better than the sequel, which manages to misuse Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. If you want to see an intelligent, actually funny comedy, watch 'Analyse This', 'My Cousin Vinny', 'Runaway Bride' or 'Legally Blonde', better yet the best comedy ever, 'Some Like It Hot'.",4,5,8,17 February 2006
Zulu," Possibly the greatest single battle film ever
","This is an incredible film. While there a few inaccuracies and some dramatic licenses, on the whole the movie follows accounts of the battle accurately. It doesn't vilify the Zulu, in fact it treats them with great respect for their bravery and devotion to their homeland. The bare facts are well known, that Rorke's Drift was the jumping off point for the British invasion of Zululand, and was a hospital and supply depot. It was defended by roughly one hundred men against some 4,000 Zulu. Stanley Baker is outstanding as Lt Chard, the senior officer at the fort, who takes command despite being an engineer officer. Michael Caine is, of course fantastic in his first big role as Lt. Bromhead. Nigel Green is superb as Colour Sergeant Bourne, who received a promotion instead of a Victoria Cross and outlived all the other defenders. The cast of mostly Welsh actors really convey the desperation and bravery of the garrison. The biggest fault with the film is the total misrepresentation of Pvt Henery Hook as a malingerer, in fact he was a good soldier and bravely risked his life to empty the hospital. The scenes of the post before the attack show soldiers at their worst in some ways, especially the treatment of Margaretta Witt. The atmosphere and attitude change when the imminent threat of Zulu attack becomes a fact. Unlike the overconfident officers at Isandlhwana, the inexperienced lieutenants build their defenses and set up ammunition supply to counter the assault. They respect their opponents and understand that they may be the last line of defense against a counter-invasion into Natal. The fighting is spectacularly filmed, highlighting the bravery and resolve of the Zulu and the determination of the redcoats to survive and hold the fort. I was embarrassed to read the comments of certain Americans who have had their brains filled with revisionist political correctness and rooted for the British soldiers to 'choke on their own vomit' and die because they were imperialist tools. Just to see this as a record of great bravery (on both sides) and an exciting entertainment apparently isn't enough, they have to spout P C drivel.",10,28,32,16 February 2006
Braveheart," Epic entertainment, if not exactly historically accurate
","'Braveheart is a very good movie, combining all the elements of a great epic and if it comes up just a bit short of greatness, it's still an entertaining three hours. The movie has everything, evil villains, brave heroes, exciting battles, romance, humor and a message. If the message is somewhat unclear in today's context, freedom is still the goal f William Wallace and his followers, the desire to rule themselves rather than to submit to outsiders. Visually, this is an exceptional picture, from the colorful costumes to some breathtaking scenery. The battles are brutal and filmed with an eye for the spectacular, flights of arrows, the heavy horse charge, the bloody hand to hand fighting and the desperation of the fighters are well filmed. One complaint is that there's no bridge to be seen in the battle of Stirling Bridge. The romance between Wallace and his village bride is well done, and her execution is heart breaking. His faithfulness is doubted in the movie as he sleeps with the Princess Isabella which is extremely unlikely. The climactic scene of Wallace screaming for 'Freedom' rather than mercy from his executioners is as powerful as anything put on the screen in the last decade at least. 'Braveheart' is an epic in the old sense and is an very good film.",9,2,4,5 March 2006
