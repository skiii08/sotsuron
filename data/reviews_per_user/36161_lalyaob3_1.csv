Come and See," A Nightmare wrapped in Atrocity
","''Come and See' is an astonishingly unforgettable, nightmarish vision into the reality of war. We the audience, watch as a young boy, a civilian, transition into a soldier. This change, makes this 12-13 year old boyage about 40 years in a matter of a few days. To endure such horror and atrocity, would definitely create such a drastic distortion to anyone. To have a film, that has the ability to even convey such profound and surreal emotionmaking us, the audience, able to feel, hear, smell and perhaps taste.. is quite daunting. One must realize, that the story line perishes, and we literally feel as if we are trapped in a nightmare, in which there is no escape. Klimov's micro cosmic approach to this specific war, was quite intense; to even think he only showed one village, out of the 628 that were brutally executedto put simplyis incredibly agonizing. I recommend this movie to all, because it will truly leave an imprint on your views towards war, and violence or humanity overall.",9,8,10,10 February 2012
