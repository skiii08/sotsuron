Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It delivers in some ways, but at the same time, it doesn't
","Unfortunately, I haven't gotten my facts straight. If there are errors concerning the plot line, I apologize in advance.The Star Wars franchise has opened doors for the gradual exploration of what experience the digital screen can truly bring us. Having just watched The Force Awakens after the original trilogy, I have decided to watch the prequel movies, which have garnered much criticism over the years.It is easy to see why.It is true that the dialogue is a bit far-fetched at times, and not brought to its full potential, particularly because it is not fully grounded and does not serve as a foundation for the world being explored. There are times when the voices of the actors seem a bit out of place in a certain scene, but it is understandably hard to act, and this may serve as the actors' personal take on their characters.It is, again, understandable why so many have been disappointed by this long-awaited release back in 1999. Putting that behind, this is my first viewing of The Phantom Menace, and I would just like to say some things about this movie.There are still things to look forward to, despite how sloppy the execution is. One would be the mere concept of the SW universe before Darth Vader came into being. The exploration of Anakin's origins begins in the Phantom Menace, which introduces new characters like Qui-Gon-Jinn who oversees his training in becoming a Jedi knight, and has us see characters from the original trilogy in a new light like Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is a Jedi knight-to-be here, and a C3PO being a creation of a young Anakin.Let's face it. No one liked Jar Jar Bink's presence on screen. Those who have watched this movie will understand why.The prequels serve as an expansion to our knowledge on the Star Wars universe, providing insight on the inner workings of the Republic. Senator/Chancellor Palpatine, secretly Darth Sidious, plots to take over the systems, later coming to be known as the Emperor (in the original trilogy). Caught in it all is Queen Amidala, a queen of a democratic state who refuses to leave the fate of her people to the dispassionate Republic (or at least, what the Republic has become). They barely leave an impression, but for those who fully enjoy the Star Wars universe, the prequel movies can be a treat, if you can clear your mind of all that makes it what it 'is' today.The Phantom Menace is a hard movie to rate. As a movie, I would give it a 5, but to its credit, it serves well as a prequel to the Star Wars' original trilogy, and doesn't completely alienate itself from the other Star Wars films like some people say it does. It still is a Star Wars film at heart - the view's just mucked up by a few things, that's all. The experience itself I would rate a 7. I was perhaps fortunate to view the films several years after its release, and frankly, I was not expecting much from this movie. It exceeds expectations, definitely. If you embrace the world surrounding it, it doesn't become as hard to watch it as it was at first, and might even mean more to you if the chance offers itself one day.Thus, the 6.",5,0,2,14 April 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Deserves A Lot of Credit as a Prequel
","In a galaxy far, far away...Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Where to start... Honestly, when I bought the movie ticket, I went in not wanting to expect too much. I even considered not watching this at all. (Please don't throw pitchforks at me.) It was not part of the episodic formula of the Star Wars movies, and was clearly a side story, a companion to Episodes III and IV.So far, the reviews have been rather mixed. Mostly positive, but there are of course those who are wondering, 'Am I the only one who thought that was overrated? Seriously?'The characters were never meant to be too memorable. It's easy to see why lack of character development can be seen as a major flaw of this movie, because at the start, the build-up really seems like it is getting to nowhere. Personally, though, I saw enough to actually care for them. I saw enough of them to feel the anguish when they reached their inevitable doom. It was what made the last few minutes of the film so worth it. It went together so nicely with 'A New Hope', seeing the path these rebels took to kindle hope in the hearts of the Rebellion once more. If it were not for the things these characters had to go through, nothing from Episode IV would have been possible. The ending of this movie was the most fitting conclusion they could have managed, I think. The sheer, emotional impact it gives is powerful. It is definitely a better experience seeing this after having seen Episode IV.It really depends on what you wanted to see from this film. It felt like a film that was a story that enriched and expanded the way we viewed the events in Star Wars. There are plenty of treats for Star Wars fans, including the scenes with Darth Vader, who has stepped up his game since the last time we saw him. We don't see much of him, but when we do, it's sure to leave a mark. (Also, let's face it, after Kylo Ren, a lot of people miss classic Vader. Rest assured, you won't be disappointed).So to answer your question, yes, as a movie, it is a bit overrated, but we can ask for nothing more from a SW prequel movie, because as a prequel, it does a terrific job. Rogue One is an emotional, dark addition to the franchise that manages to exceed expectations, a small phenomenon that helps the love for Star Wars burn brighter.",8,3,8,21 December 2016
Les Mis√©rables," A humble opinion on a grand production...
","It's only right to say that I have not had the privilege of watching the Broadway play, of reading the novel by Victor Hugo, and of watching the 1998 movie version. Still, let me say this:I loved it. So very much.What should first be acknowledged of course is the source material. Victor Hugo is unquestionably a masterful writer to have written such a compelling tale of love, sacrifice, redemption, and revolution.How much better can it get?We were supposed to watch this adaptation in class, due to our teacher's absence. However, she did not leave a copy, and instead, opted to have us answer a few questions in our book, and a chart concerning the character traits of Jean Valjean over the years. And yet, it came to me that I was writing about a character I knew nothing about other than what little was spoonfed to us from our English textbook - who exactly was Jean Valjean? Police Inspector Javert? Fantine? What message did the author want to convey upon writing about a common man in 17th century Paris?To be honest, this is my third attempt in watching this adaptation of Les Miserables (two of which were when I was about a year younger than I am now - and both failed attempts, at that). Aside from my English class, I needed stress relief from other projects.I do not regret picking this up again. And I never will.This adaptation was such a pleasure to watch as an introduction to one of the greatest works in literature, a literal classic. It succeeds in evoking the emotion needed to fully enjoy Victor Hugo's maelstrom: it succeeds in showing the raw cruelty of those impoverished times. It succeeds in making you grit your teeth because life is so, so unfair, and there are many who suffer because of it.Those who have read the novel have stated that this is the more emotional version, by far, when compared to the 1998 version, because it truly gets the characters' intentions across (and apparently, the 1998 version strays from the characters of the source material). If these are the characters in their true forms - then I can ask for nothing more, because these characters took my breath away. Jean Valjean's conflict with the past that continuously haunts him and the man that he has become, Cosette's curiosity and love for her father (and vice versa), Marius' devotion to his cause and what he felt for all that he lost because of it, Fantine's living hell, Eponine's unrequited love and selflessness, and Inspector Javert's conflict regarding justice and mercy.I found myself so immersed into the story, because it was one that gradually consumed me in heart and mind. What was this irony, wherein only death would put an end to Jean Valjean's suffering, offering him mercy in times when many else started walking into the light, all the fruit of his efforts to love and to repent and to begin anew? It was clear that he was no longer the man that he used to be, yet he was driven to an end that he did not deserve because people branded him for what he HAD done (and even then, it was to feed his sister's seven children!). I found myself asking what Javert must have asked himself, looking down at the world he would soon part with. ('Look down, look down,' the voices sung.) Was justice a truth, or an ideal pursued blindly? Could all things be encompassed by the law? Questioning all he believed, he too, ended his life.It was all very, very emotional. The bent backs of the slaves, Jean Valjean's turmoil. ('Who am I?') Fantine, losing what little she had, reaching out for Cosette as she lay dying, no longer living after being assured that the ONLY thing she lived for was in good hands. Eponine, dying in the arms of the only man she ever loved, asking nothing more than to be glanced at by him. To be his heaven, and his only one. Gavroche, walking towards the soldiers, believing in what they fought for, then reaching his untimely end. Enjolras, a brave soul that died for his countrymen and a good friend to all he knew. Marius, waking up to the aftermath, finding that all his friends he had laughed with were gone. Cosette telling him that they would never be apart, and that he still had her. Marius, telling Cosette that they would never be apart during Jean Valjean's dying moments - Jean Valjean's last moments which were spent thinking about Cosette, and only Cosette (thus, Fantine's appearance near the end).It was all very tragic, but at the same time hopeful. Les Miserables will no doubt always hold a special place in my heart. A tale of kindness repaid with kindness, bravery and strength, and most importantly, light in a time of darkness, all coupled with stellar performances and beautiful cinematography in this splendid adaptation of this timeless classic.",9,0,0,25 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A good weekend movie... but for a Star Wars movie? Err....
","Spoilers ahead.Taking down a powerful battle station through the oscillator? A youth whose potential with The Force runs strong? A masked villain wanting to take down the Resistance and change the ways of the galaxy? A dealer who Han Solo conveniently runs into in some strange looking pub? Why, that sounds exactly like what we saw and loved in the original trilogy.Only, this movie fails miserably in trying to bring forth to a new generation what was once, and still is, a classic series that should be enjoyed by all.I am very very late in joining the Star Wars wagon. It undeniably sparked my interest when The Force Awakens was about to come out and around that time, a fanart of one of my favorite characters in a certain fandom was drawn as a Jedi/lightsaber wielder. Downloading the Big Three (the original trilogy), I was charmed and hooked by this huge space opera with memorable characters. It is 2016, and I decide to try Episode VII: The Force Awakens, planning to watch The Phantom Menace and co., in a short while.We meet Rey, a scavenger in the desert planet of Jakku waiting for her family who'd left her all those years ago. She has an encounter with Finn, a stormtrooper who wishes to turn away from The First Order and dons the identity of a person from the Resistance (which still includes the characters we all loved from the original trilogy, General Leia Organa, C3PO, even R2-D2...) and comes upon a BB-8 droid model carrying information to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi knight from the era of the Empire. Only, the droid is sought out by Kylo Ren, a masked man who has his own ideals and is lured into the dark side of the force by Supreme Leader Snoke, a bald white organism that may just be human but will stop at nothing to get his way by obliterating the last of the Jedi... the fate of the galaxy rests on Rey's hands, as, the force is strong within her.Now, the bad part.It doesn't seem so bad, until you realize... it's been done before. Where the previous cast of characters from the original trilogy stand out and can stand up on their own and will be remembered for years to come is where the new cast of characters fail to shine through.One would argue that The Force Awakens should not be compared to the original trilogy. Thing is, it tries so hard to be what the original trilogy used to be that... it pulls itself down.Finn has faced trauma from all the blood shed throughout the galaxy under the influence of the First Order. Kylo Ren is shadowed by his past... and he wishes to continue what his grandfather, Darth Vader, started. Thing is, almost none of this is explored.We know that Kylo Ren is lured into the dark side of the force. But he is simply not an interesting, compelling character and we as viewers get close to no insight on his inner conflict. He slashes his light saber around and abuses his Jedi power - but that does not make him come off the least bit threatening. He just comes off very confused (which is, probably the film's intention and sort of backfires because we do not sympathize with him as much either. We're not meant to, but it's a possibility.)Rey is a shadow of Luke. She's adept at the force, she has a strong will, and she is a superb pilot. What bothered me the most about her was her duel with Kylo Ren at the end. The Force is meant to defend; never to attack. She is determined to defeat Kylo Ren. She did not undergo the rigorous training Luke did in The Empire Strikes Back. There is no one to train her in TFA, but she WILL be trained in Episode VIII! Is this saying she was lucky with disarming Kylo Ren? She's that good? It... just sounds a bit unlikely, don't you think? The power of determination and conviction does not always work out; and while it might in other movies, certainly not in Star Wars. Not when it's delivered this carelessly with the original trilogy backing up its current fame.What perhaps saves this movie and brings it down at the same time is the fact that it IS a Star Wars movie: Leia and Han, Chewbacca, R2- D2, C3PO, and a certain character's cameo at the end - there are parts that will surely warm your heart and make you think back to Star Wars' glory days.That being said, the graphics are very well done (it is Disney, after all). If you're new to the Star Wars franchise and are in need of a decent enough weekend movie (albeit forgettable), by all means, do try this. But do know that Star Wars is meant to be so much more than that, and nothing will ever replace the original trilogy.",7,10,15,11 April 2016
