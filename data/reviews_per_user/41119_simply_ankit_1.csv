Airlift," Good, not exceptional!
","A movie such as this is supposed to be a nail-biting thriller, which unfortunately Airlift isn't. The movie doesn't offer you much to feel the actual tension that might have existed, the fear of death which people lived everyday, stuck in a war zone. The movie goes on like a monotonous narration of a series of incidents which led to a historic achievement in the form of world's most successful evacuation. The thrill, and the gripping plot behind each of those events is missing. It's a brave attempt to bring to the world the story of a brave rescue operation, but as I read in one of the comments here, the movie lacks sharpness. It stops just at good when it could have been exceptional.",6,10,28,22 January 2016
