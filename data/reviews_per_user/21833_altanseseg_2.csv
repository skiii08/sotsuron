10 Cloverfield Lane," Horrible plot development, and useless ending.
","What the hell was this movie? I am a huge enthusiast when it comes to horror/thriller movies, and once in a while, I really do love myself a good containment movie. Although it seems that this movie was a swing and miss for the type of content that it obviously wanted to portray. Here are the many things that were wrong with this movie: 1. Let's talk about the fact that this girl's kidnapper should not have been the one who was insane. When analyzing a situation like this most people would automatically assume that this poor old man was, in fact, the one who was insane in this movie and would have gotten enjoyment from watching him develop into what they expected while the movie was expanding its plot. To keep all of this short and concise, the right person to have been made insane should have been the one other person in the whole situation; Emmet. Emmet was perfect for the job, along with the fact that this would have been a perfect twist to Michelle, the one who trusted him oh so much.2. What in the world were the writers thinking when they thought that they could introduce a new character into the movie, and completely ignore giving her a detailed backstory? At the moment, I mean the girl who was killed in the room with the air ventilation system. This killing made me very excited and further proved the fact that Emmet should have been the insane one. He himself said that he helped make the shelter, which means that he had absolute access to it and could have easily had the opportunity to kill a girl that had more of a personal connection to him than Howard. 3. Don't even get me started on the ending. The movie would have been perfectly fine had she escaped and saw the world outside as undisturbed and consistently beautiful, but no, this movie had to play a nasty chord on my heartstrings and introduced a completely unexplained alien along with an alien spacecraft that apparently was 'definitely a military aircraft'. Goodness, I hated this movie, it was a pain to watch.",1,21,38,19 March 2016
Inception," OK, fine.
","Honestly. I loved this movie solely because of the fact that it introduced a philosophical concept to a demographic that may have minimal knowledge on the subject (me). After reading the reviews I saw for people who said that this movie deserved 1 star I had 2 thoughts. 1. Why would you make it a 1? Did the movie offend you enough for you to discredit the quality of the film?2. I understand that dreaming and waking up continuously may be a confusing state of affairs although I have confidence that the major popularity knows how to put 2 and 2 together.There are many things wrong with the technology used in this film like: How could all of these people interact if they were dreaming through separate minds? Is there even a technology that can induce lucid dreams? How in the world did they construct the specific materialization of certain objects in these dreams?With all of these factors, the plot development was absolutely amazing, and I can safely say that I will be watching this again.",9,0,2,19 March 2016
