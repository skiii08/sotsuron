Casablanca," One of the all time great films
","Just as great music will not appeal to everybody so great films will appeal to many but not all. This is a masterpiece of film making, the chemistry is all there. The stars all have a part to play and each does it so well that the finished product is brilliant. This really is the sum of all the parts making near perfection. As in 'Some Like it Hot' the 'one liners' are superb. Those who have not seen this film are missing one of the colours of the rainbow.",Null,0,0,27 January 1999
