United 93," What an experience.
","I have never felt like this at a movie in my entire life. The emotions I felt while watching this were indescribable. The scenes on the doomed flight were claustrophobic, shaky and made you feel as if you were there. The confusion and action at Norad and The FAA Control center were real. It plays like a documentary. All of the criticism that has befallen the release of this movie are unfounded. It is respectful and powerful. It portrays the people as they were, just regular people forced into an impossible situation banding together as a last resort to save their lives. The direction is flawless. The acting is superior. The cinematography at times is a little nausea inducing, and that coupled with the subject matter makes it really tough to watch at times. Everything I read and everything I knew about this flight could not prepare me for this experience. It could have been anyone on that plane. You, me anyone. When I first heard about this movie I pictured Hollywood bastardizing the subject matter and having the passengers unfurl an American Flag and chant USA USA as the try to take the plane, but none of that sentiment was present. Best Picture 2006 here it is. Paul Greengrass deserves every accolade he has coming.",10,0,2,8 May 2006
Captain Marvel," This is an Honest and Real Take on 'Captain Marvel'
","I am tired of online campaigns to tear down popular movies. I saw it with The Force Awakens, Last Jedi and now with Captain Marvel.I honestly believe all negative reviews from between a score of 1-3 are just people who like to attack popular pop culture, people who can't stand that women can be heroes or just simple trolls.Its not a perfect movie by any stretch but Captain Marvel fits right in between the Cosmic Marvel aspects of the franchise and the Earth bound aspects of the franchise. It feels like a cousin of Guardians of the Galaxy featuring alien races and some familiar faces in Ronin the Accuser and Korath from Guardians of the Galaxy.Its no secret that the MCU has become the biggest franchise in movie history and has had some poor entries with Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World and a couple of others. This is not one of those entries.The cast is great from Brie Larson all the way down to the extras in the movie it is acted very well. The special effects are a little behind the best Marvel has produced especially near the end when the title character fully realizes her power.The effects on Samuel L. Jackson & Clark Gregg to 'de-age' them was nearly flawless, as 5 minutes into the movie I forgot that this was a special effect. Amazing job on that.It is not the best, but an excellent appetizer for the forth coming 'Endgame'.Don't buy into the hate. Go see it yourself.",7,8,30,11 March 2019
Dawn of the Dead," IT could have been....
","This movie could have been easily the best of the 'Zombie genre' and had a chance to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Then a certain scene happens known as the 'baby scene' that while not wanting to ruin it for people who have not seen it makes you think that you have suddenly been shuffled into another movie. Its not the scene itself I have such a problem with, but its what the characters do immediately after the scene is over. What was a tense, edge of your seat thriller became a clich√©d horribly thought out third act that basically ruins the greatness of the first two thirds. What the characters choose to do is so asinine and stupid you just throw your hands up realizing another Hollywood blown opportunity to do the horror genre justice. Think of it this way, and Boston fans can understand this, your up 8-0 in the bottom of the 7th in game 7 of the World Series and your set up man and closer wind up blowing the lead behind 6 errors and horrid pitching. I cant remember a movie where I have been more upset over a movies sudden nose dive because this could have been a classic.FCT",5,0,0,16 August 2006
Thor: Ragnarok," Temper Your Expectations. Thor: Ragnarok is just OK.
","Spoilers below. I am of the mind that not everything has to be a joke. The Good? Blanchett is excellent as Hela. The best villains are ones who believe they are right and make a great case for what they are doing. She is the rightful air to the throne. Idris Elba gets to sink his teeth into something a little more meaty than standing around in gold armor unlocking the Bi-Frost. Valkyrie is excellent also. People have said Its good Hulk got to show some personality. He always does.. he just never really talked before. I like Hulk being more than he was in the past but its not without some problems. Now the questions - Why is Thor all of a sudden a slapstick comedian telling joke after joke if he thinks his whole home world is in danger and his father just died? Why could Odin deal with Loki an adopted frost giant, but not Hela his own daughter? He couldn't put his foot down and tell her hey... we're doing this now. Stop the fighting. Why doesn't Banner remember anything while he is the Hulk? How was Molnir destroyed? Every living Asgaardian fit on that one ship? What are there... like 2,000 of them? That was a whole planet destroyed. Must be a small planet. All in all it was a good movie - Not a great one. You would think with his whole planet and every living inhabitant threatened Thor would not be reduced to being Jerry Seinfeld cracking jokes every other sentence.",6,0,4,13 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Ignore any review under 5 stars.

Logan," Raw, Brutal, Uncompromising and Outstanding
","Logan has been on my radar for a while because it looked different. Super hero movies these days (this is not an insult it is common knowledge) have become somewhat formulaic. Marvel is particularly guilty of this and you cannot blame them because they have churned out good movie after good movie. Logan is something else entirely. From the first five minutes you know you are in for something very different not just because of the 'R' rating, but because of the dirty, gritty nature of the first scene. When the violence erupts it is presented in a no holds barred brutal manner you would expect from a guy who has lived a life as long, brutal and as violent as Logan has. He has had enough of having to fight his whole life and when he does fight he is absolutely doing it with no holds barred. The action scenes are designed amazingly well and it is nice to see them grounded in reality especially after 'Apocalypse' and its super cartoon like flippy twirling action scenes. I have not returned to see an XMEN movie in the theater a second time, and I loved 'Days of Future Past'. I will be returning to see Logan again. I may be naive but I think Jackman should receive award consideration for his role as Logan. I cannot recommend Logan higher. The only reason it does not get a perfect 10/10 score is because of some continuity issues with previous installments of the franchise. Leave the little ones at home. Judge what your kids can handle by seeing it first without them if they are under 15. If they are under 10 they should skip this one until they are ready to see it at home when they are older.",9,6,15,9 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Following the Original was a Tough Job
","In my mind the original Guardians of the Galaxy is a perfect movie. It hits all of the right notes from the opening credit and is a complete joy to watch from beginning to end. Vol. 2 is a worthy successor to the original. Let's get that out of the way right now. What it is not is a movie that will challenge the original in any capacity when it comes to the joy the original is to watch. The feeling you get watching the opening sequence is basically the feeling I got throughout the movie. That feeling is basically the feeling that what you are watching is entertaining but seems as though it is something you have seen done better before. It really was an impossible task to ask this movie give you that all out joy the original did but the comparisons are inevitable. I don't want to give the impression that I did not enjoy Vol. 2. I did enjoy it. It gives you most of the answers you were looking for at the end of the original. The special effects are taken to the next level and are nearly flawless. The music choices are along the same lines with the original and give you that tap your foot, sing along feeling of the original as well. I will see it again and post an update to this review. Be sure to sit through the credits as always.",8,0,2,9 May 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is Strong With this One
","This franchise does not need to be defended by anyone. It exists as a juggernaut of franchises and cannot and will not be stopped. The Force Awakens is a spectacular entry in the Star Wars franchise. I take issue with anyone who finds nothing in this entry to enjoy. It literally is a joy to watch from beginning to end. It brings back just about every feeling you could want in a sequel of this nature. The original cast members that return are quite simply Star Wars royalty and all do their jobs excellently. Ford steals the movie as Solo in a performance that will be legendary. The new cast's in Ridley, Boyega, Gleeson, Driver and Isaac are all home runs and they did a great job of laying the ground work for future episodes. The force is strong again... and Star Wars is back in every way possible. Great job by all involved.",9,9,30,21 February 2017
V for Vendetta," Excellent Work
","Excellent work from all involved. Being a fan of all 3 Matrix movies, (no thats not a typo) I obviously had this movie in my sights for quite a while. It captures everything the Wachowski's crew does well, and leaves what they do not do well pretty much out of sight here. The Effects are seamless, the acting is superb, the story is powerful. The picture starts like many other super hero/comic movies start off. Damsel in distress gets saved from being attacked, robbed and raped by said superhero. After this scene, it becomes something else, something different, which is what the Wachowski's crew is so good at. The Matrix was like something we have never seen before, and V for Vendetta is no different. Hugo Weaving gives as wonderful a performance though his face is concealed he uses his mannerisms, voice, and body language to do his acting for him. Portman buries her work from Closer and gives maybe the performance of her career. Go see it, you wont be disappointed.FCT",9,2,6,20 March 2006
