Iron Man 3," Geriatric heroes?
","Ummmm, why am I watching 40-50 year old actors cast as super heros? Makes no sense.",1,0,2,24 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Goofs section goes too far
","The Goofs section of this IMDb makes several statements that are just ridiculous. Complaints about the plot are just silly. The plot comes strait from the novel, whose plot makes perfect sense...given a world of magic. The fact that some things don't make perfect sense, like detention in the off-limits forest, is part of the charm of the Potter stories. Whoever wrote these complaints either hasn't read the books, or just doesn't get Rowling's humor.The other points about continuity are good though.Thanks. Mike in Vancouver",Null,1,2,14 October 2006
