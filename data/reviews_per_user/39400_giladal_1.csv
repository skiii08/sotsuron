United 93," Definitely portrayed the message
","This movie sent shivers down my body. It makes you feel as if you were there with the passengers. The weirdest thing about it, is that it is a true story. Definitely an eye opener and will keep September 11th in our mind, and we will never forget that dreadful day. I am an airline pilot and was horrified by the act of the first officer (co-pilot) that opened the door without looking through the peep hole after 'the flight attendant' knocked. This was the hijackers ticket into the cockpit. Besides that, this movie may cause some racist responses against the Muslim world. The hijackers seem very religious. Greengrass did an amazing job, and so did the actors. The movie also goes quick from the controller scene to the airplane scene. It is kind of hard to keep up. Interesting would be to know how this movie will succeed around the world and not for money reasons.",10,2,6,29 April 2006
