Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good start.
","I thought the movie was quite good. I felt the story was there, but it needed to focus more on Anakin than the trade dispute itself. I mean, I didn't wait 16 years to worry about the inhabitants of Naboo. I felt that the Tattoine section of the film and the political maneuvering on Coruscant were the best parts. Watto and Sebullah were excellent characters, very fun to watch. I was disappointed that Darth Maul was not given more dialogue and developed more thoroughly. He was almost a non-event, which is a pity, considering he has all the potential of being a great movie villain.Ewan Mcgregor and Liam Neeson played their characters excellently. They showed Jedi Knights as they were, amazingly intelligent and confident warriors with incredible abilities.Jake Lloyd played his role brilliantly, a very intelligent actor for such a young age. He totally surprised me.The Gungans were a waste of time. I think that they looked goofy and I couldn't take their army seriously. The same can be said of the Palace Guards. I thought their costumes were odd looking and I could never place any confidence in their abilities whatsoever. Which meant that the final battle was a waste of time for me.All in all a good start.",7,0,0,23 May 1999
