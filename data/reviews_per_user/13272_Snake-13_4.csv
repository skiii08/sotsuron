Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," just ignore the hype and criticism and get ready for a great ride
","There's been so much hype for this movie that it's almost ridiculous. Everything from ordering advance tickets to hard-core fans camping out at box offices shows that this may be the most anticipated movie ever. However, as George Lucas himself said in an interview on May 9th, 'People should have a well-rounded life. I'm happy that Star Wars stimulates young people's imagination, but when you're in a situation like this where you have so much hype and expectations, a movie can't possibly live up to that.' He's absolutely right, the more hype you have going in, the more disappointed you'll be. After seeing the movie on May 19th at 7:30, I've never felt so good walking out of a movie theater. I must admit that I'm a huge SW fan, but the feeling of seeing a new chapter in the saga unfold on the big screen generates the same feeling that people had coming out of' Star Wars: A New Hope' in 1977. AS for the bad criticism bombarding this movie, who cares? Some of their gripes didn't come to mind while I watched the movie. First of all, Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin Skywalker has been criticized almost everywhere, which seems a bit unfair. He's enthusiastic, not polished, and besides, that's pretty much what you'd expect from a nine-year-old-would-be Jedi, right? Also, Jar Jar Binks isn't as annoying as people say he is. At best, he's funny; at worst, he's nothing more than a scenery-chewer who is still tolerable. Finally, the idea of THE PHANTOM MENACE turning movie theaters into giant arcades is both unreasonable and unfair. I do think that Lucas over-does the effects sometimes (with so many ships and aliens on screen, you don't really have the time to appreciate everything), and even then, the effects are to help create the universe we're in, not to be thrown out there for small moments of awe. I loved all the action sequences, including the pod race, the ground battle between two completely computer-generated opponents, and especially the two-on-one lightsaber duel (my favorite part!). Personally though, I think the space battle involving Anakin was more amusing than thrilling (you'll have to see for yourself). Also, the music score was excellent, incorporating familar tunes with new twists, and also providing foreshadowing (listen carefully when Darth Sidious appears, and when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan speak about Anakin's future.) Overall, when you're standing outside the door to a new SW experience, just clear your mind of hype, criticism, and may the force be with you.",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
Erin Brockovich," a breath of fresh air: ***1/2 (out of ****)
","For me, 2000 has been a dreary year for films so far. The best I've seen was 'Mission to Mars,' which was good, but not great. Now, after enduring the demolishing, almost painful U-571, ERIN BROCKOVICH arrives like a desperately needed antidote for poison. Meaningfull, well-balanced motion pictures like these always remind me why I love the movies. ERIN BROCKOVICH is an intelligent, wonderfully-developed legal thriller, featuring a very strong lead performance by Julia Roberts and scene-stealing work from Albert Finney, and the tone provides both humor and poignancy that I haven't witnessed since AMERICAN BEAUTY, my #1 film of 1999.    First of all, anyone who best associates Julia Roberts with crowd-pleasing, gentle romantic comedies will be absolutely shocked here. Brockovich isn't exactly the kind of character one would immediately refer to as 'likable'; she clearly displays a surly manner and profane vocabulary. However, despite this, there are plenty of opportunities to connect with her, and hardly a moment is wasted. Her dialouge with Ed Masry (Finney) sparkles with electricity, even though there's no hint of sexual attraction. Of course, since the characters and their situations are engaging as presented, there's no need for that element.    One of the things I appreciated the most about ERIN BROCKOVICH was its sense of balance and realism. Often in films like these, when the main character is placed in an extraordinary situation, his/her home life is completely ignored, leaving the viewer wondering, 'Does this person have a life outside of this?' Not here. One of the film's most affecting moments is Erin's realization that she missed the first word spoken by her infant child. Although her job is earning her much respect, she is away from her children for lengthy periods of time, and this puts a strain on the family relationship. Like many opportunities in life, her job is a double-edged sword, and the film never pulls any punches showing the various conflicts that arise.     What makes ERIN BROCKOVICH unique is that it traverses a different path from what one would normally expect from a legal thriller. With one small exception, Erin is not followed or stalked by shadowy figures. She does not become the target of violence or threats from terrorists (although the possibility exists). Instead, the suspense here stems from the issue of whether a modern-day David can succeed in today's legal world against Goliath, or as a character in the film puts it, 'what's-his-name's whole family.' Finally, in what may be the most relieving aspect in the movie, there are no huge over-the-top speeches. No big courtroom scenes. No manipulative melodrama. People who love to rant about such problems can rest easy.    This film really moves; it has zest, hilariously funny moments, unforced emotion, and a cliche-free narrative. After viewing both this and THE LIMEY, I now consider myself a fan of director Steven Soderbergh. I'm heading to my nearest Blockbuster to check out more of his movies. For everyone else, go see this movie, and don't worry about ACCESS HOLLYWOOD's hype about Julia Roberts' wardrobe-- it doesn't serve any real purpose.",Null,0,0,22 April 2000
U-571," BIG dissapointment: ** (out of ****)
","It is well known that wonderful sound and film editing can save a movie that is lacking in other aspects such as credibility and good acting. Sadly, the opposite is also true, and U-571 demonstrates it clearly. Normally, people love theaters, as do I; their superior sound quality can make you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. This sort of advantage has made viewings of movies like THE MATRIX, THE PHANTOM MENACE, and THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH immensely pleasurable. However, U-571 makes a fatal mistake here; this is a loud movie, and I mean a REALLY loud movie. While the volume is just fine during scenes with plenty of dialouge and little action, it jumps beyond the breaking point during the action sequences. Here, what is intended to be suspenseful is just plain annoying.     Even when ruling out the over-the-top pyrotechnics, U-571 is lacking in another key area too. The characters here are undeveloped; only one of them is shown to have a past, but everyone else is only here to serve the plot. Nevertheless, this movie isn't about personalities and character development; it's about engaging the viewer and taking him/her on what is intended to be an underwater roller-coaster ride of sorts. Even there, it doesn't work because the sound effects are so pumped up and the camera moves so frenetically that several supposedly nail-biting suspense scenes become irritating.    There's really not much more I can say about this movie. The acting really isn't worth talking about-- everyone does a solid job-- but there isn't much here to make each character stand out. Really, this is one of those films where you refer to most people as 'this guy' or 'that guy.' Even though all major characters' names are given, it was easy for me to forget them. But in the end it all comes back to the overbearing volume in this movie. Yes, I understand that depth charges, guns, bursting pipes, and explosions make loud noises, but when they overpower the viewing experience, it's all just too much.    I suspect that U-571 will work better on video than in a theater. If you have a surround-sound system set up, you're in luck. You can set the volume at appropriate levels and be drawn in to the experience. The crazy camera won't be much of a problem either since a living room with a TV provides a more intimate medium than a theater with a screen stretching outward. U-571 should come equipped with a bright warning label that it is not viewer-friendly.",Null,0,1,21 April 2000
The Insider," Positively riveting: ***1/2 (out of ****)
","I've been waiting to see this film for some time now, and while one could easily accuse me of sccumbing to Academy Award hype, the truth is that planned on seeing THE INSIDER all along, but never got around to it. Now I have seen 4 out of 5 of the Best Picture Nominees (all except THE CIDER HOUSE RULES).When I first heard about this movie and it's story, I thought, 'hmmmmm.... sounds like something I'd walk out on.' Well, I didn't, and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly as well. However, also I'm aware of the fact that THE INSIDER is in fact based on real life events and altered for dramatic effect, I don't remember the time when those events actually took place, or what happened (News like that never interested me that much). My opinion can be called, at its core, limited.Now about THE INSIDER'S strength as a movie-- it has truckloads of it. The cinematography is quite edgy, and establishes a dark, uncertain tone with lots of bleak, muted colors. Mann generates tension without resorting to the standard chase scenes and shoot-outs. The actors play their characters as if there really is something tangible on the line, which helps highten the intensity. The film tackles some big issues and morals, including how a top-drawer news corporation like CBS was pressured by financial and legal issues to cut a major story. It's also about Jeffery Wigand's struggle with his conscience, his struggle against his former employers, and the hardship of him and his wife trying to accept the sacrifices they had to make.In some ways, THE INSIDER is like a two-act play. The first half, like I said before, concentrates mostly on Wigand and his circumstances, and he is in nearly every scene. Later on, the focus shifts to Lowell Bergman and the 60 Minutes crew as a battle ensues over journalistic integrity and the consequences of airing such a revealing story on the air. Actually, I found THE INSIDER'S first half to be unquestionably stronger than its first; the emotional core becomes slightly murky later on. Minor problems aside however, THE INSIDER is a very worthy film, and possesses a kinetic flow that never stops moving. There are very few slow scenes, and if there are, I can't remember them completely.Nothing ranks higher in THE INSIDER than the acting factor. Al Pacino is at his intense best here, even though this isn't a particularly 'new' kind of role for him. He screams his head off in a lot of his movies :). Russell Crowe certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for his excellent work here. He finds every nook-and-cranny in Wigand's character. Like many memorable heroes, this guy is certainly flawed, and Crowe depicts him forcefully. Also memorable is Christopher Plummer in his version of 60 Minutes' Mike Wallace. He also suplies a great deal of intensity, and his single standout is during a scene when some of his on-air comments have been censored on a broadcast. Everyone else is solid, but I have to stop the commentary somewhere.This is one of those films where the energy level is always high, and keeps the viewer in until the very end. The concepts will certainly confuse some people who didn't pay much attention to the real-life events based on THE INSIDER (like me), but most of the focus is on the characters here. The end result is an endlessly compelling and engaging movie that combines the intensity of a thriller and a drama into a unique hybrid.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
