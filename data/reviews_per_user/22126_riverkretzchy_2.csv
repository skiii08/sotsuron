Alien 3," like drinking acid
","A complete deviation from the previous two films, and in the worst way possible. It's like someone wrote a film about horny sewage rats and decided at the last minute to put an CGI alien and someone called 'Ripley' into it. Don't waste your time, and even if you think you might like it because you liked the other two, don't bother. I loved the first film, liked the second, hated this one.",1,2,9,19 April 2017
The Village," Don't be put off by negative reviews
","Lots of people hated this film. Personally I loved it. Even though I saw the twist coming from the very beginning and therefore wasn't surprised by it, I just thoroughly enjoyed the film as a whole. The use of colour was beautiful, the creatures were beautifully designed and original, and the cast was superb. I would highly recommend this film, and I don't understand why some people hated it so much. Different tastes, I guess.",10,1,3,19 April 2017
