Alien 3," My hatred for this film knows no bounds...
","I remember seeing the trailers for this film the December before it opened. On a sort of high from just seeing the first two movies, I was expecting big things from the second 'Alien' sequel, and the trailer promised exactly that: 'In space, no one can hear you scream... but on Earth, everyone can!' was the tagline.So what do we get instead?  A wretched excuse for a sequel to two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.  First of all, the story is beyond simply depressing... it undoes everything from the first two movies, and utterly destroys Ripley's world.  Everything she's fought for is for naught.  We almost want her to die, to end the ceaseless buffet of suffering her life has become.  We must suffer through uninteresting characters that are indistinguishable from each other, dull 'turn around and there's the alien' shocks, poor camera work during the action sequences (some would call it style, I call it confusing and obnoxious), and finally the ending that gels perfectly with this bottomless abyss of a movie.  Alien Ressurection be damned... this travesty should have been a dream, and David Fincher should have stuck to directing Madonna videos.",3,498,545,9 April 1999
Monty Python's Life of Brian," A truly great comedy masterpiece
","Most Americans only know of Monty Python through their famous film about King Arthur, but while that film is hilarious in its own right, Life of Brian is the troupe's magnum opus.  Truly brilliant and shameless in its well-aimed jabs at Christianity, Judaism, and... religion in general, really.  The Pythons were a brilliant team of writers and performers (among the best of the 20th century) and this film helps to prove it.",9,1,4,10 June 1999
Army of Darkness," One fun movie
","If anyone can view this film and then say to me that Sam Raimi is not an 'auteur', I'll cram the entire Evil Dead trilogy down their throat.  Sam's movies are always fun and visually unique, and Army of Darkness is no exception.  Here, Bruce Campbell's Ash character becomes a sort of wise-cracking action hero, as opposed to the zombie punching-bag he was in the earlier films, and the focus of the series shifts from comedy-horror to supernatural comedy-action.  The film is a total trip from start to end, and Raimi's oddball camera tricks coupled with Campbell's over-the-top performance add to the fun.  Also listen for some great one-liners, which have been ripped off in other media (Duke Nukem, most notoriously).  A must-see for anyone who likes total escapism.",8,1,1,9 April 1999
Princess Mononoke," One of the best animated films EVER.
","Anyone who's convinced that Japanese animation consists of nothing more than sex and violence needs to see the collected works of Hayao Miyazaki. Granted, that can be difficult, as few of his films are available (legally) in the States, but it's a task that is well worth it.  His movies are always overflowing with strong, complex characters, involving stories, and breathtaking scenery.That said, when I heard that Mononoke Hime was a tale about man versus nature, I was a little hesitant, despite the fact that it was Miyazaki's work.  I shouldn't have been.  The film may be ecologically-aware, but the throrough treatment it gives to the subject makes previous animated American shots at the same look like the preachy, simplistic claptrap they are (paging Captain Planet...).  Neither side in MH's battle is 'evil' - both are fighting to preserve their way of life.  And the cliche of nature as pure and righteous is tossed aside here; the animal gods are just as given to unseeing hatred as their human enemies.Anyway, if you only watch one animated film in a year, it should be this one.  Hell, if you don't watch ANY animated films... well, you get the idea. It's a simply beautiful animated epic.",10,0,1,31 October 1999
