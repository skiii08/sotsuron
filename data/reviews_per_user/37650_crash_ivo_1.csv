Iron Man 3," Looking forward to see what is coming...
","At first i was mad because the Mandarin not being real and of course the villain was like not good enough but after a while when i was thinking about the film i really saw the big plot there. Imo they tried to show how a mare man deals with the life after the big event from the Avengers. Ofc he is Tony Stark (genious, billionaire ... etc. etc.) but his experience so far is nothing compared to the others(Thor, HULK , Captain America). After all i like how the movie showed his struggle with accepting all that happened. It was funny, action was good and overall a solid performance. Big movies are coming up and we should look at the movies Marvel universe as something new and not to compare it with the comics and the animated movies. I am really looking forward with great expectations and a chill for the next movies and how they will show thing and what innovations will they present to the public. Cheers.",7,1,2,8 January 2014
