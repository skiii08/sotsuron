Vertigo," Deservedly labelled as one of the greatest of all time
","So this is often labelled as one of the greatest films of all time; I haven't seen enough movies to agree or disagree, but it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Alfred Hitchcock is at his best with this suspenseful mystery, unraveled by a retired detective being the subject of merciless mind games. The story and direction are nearly perfect and the mystery is solved with appropriate pacing and character development (mainly Scottie, the detective, and Madeleine, his target). The movie lets the audience figure out parts of the mystery for themselves (so there's lots of, 'OH THAT THING,' moments, which is the movie engaging the audience and making the viewing experience even better). The effects and music are excellent - my favourite scene is Scottie's nightmare where he looks into the grave (you'll find out) and falls into a spiral with flowers transforming into colours and all this beautiful stuff (it's 1958, so you don't even expect much, but Hitchcock nails it with stuff that looks better than some of what you see today). No scenes in the film feel out of place; there's no bad or unsuitable moments - whenever the film's not being brilliant, it's still very good and sustains itself well. The lead performances are great, especially Stewart's (he plays Scottie), who works in the unfortunate victim role brilliantly, with his acting of fear and nervousness being the most notable parts. Their romance is steadily driven along a fine line with over-sexualisation on one side and being annoying on the other, being perfectly woven into the story and seeming entirely human (doesn't even seem like a movie, given how their relationship develops with Scottie's behavioural changes). The only potential problem would be people not fully understanding the mystery (I did, and people should put in some effort to process events and connect the dots themselves because films - especially masterpieces - rarely explain everything explicitly).",9,5,6,23 November 2017
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," No jokes held back here, folks, and it pays off
","What can sort of be described as live-action South Park, we have a freely offensive and comedic mockumentary (look it up; Borat is the first photo you get) with a wonderfully stereotyped depiction of American and especially Kazakhstani culture. This is one of those production-inside-a-film movies (e.g. Synecdoche, New York, The Disaster Artist, Birdman, etc.) where Borat - a wacky and uncensored reporter - is sent to the US to bring back knowledge that can be used to improve Kazakhstan, which you can tell from the full title. It maintains its documentary feel, despite being an overall joke, while 'reporting' (making fun of) on any aspects of America that Borat stumbles upon, from feminism to the South to the most devout Christians one can find in the country. The biggest aspect of this is the humour, of course. They held nothing back while writing this and coming up with ideas, which is kind of evident from the amount of stuff under 'Controversies' in its Wikipedia article. They go after (along with those mentioned above) Jewish people, Southerners (he screws with their sense of tradition and conservatism), feminists (those who think women and men should be equal, an idea which Borat mocks with comparisons to Kazakhstan), rednecks/hillbillies (showing how they give in to nationalism), and more. The humour is a mix of subtle (less people will understand it), obvious and ridiculous (you laugh due to his randomness and stupidity). I didn't get offended by any of the jokes; I just sat back and enjoyed the ride. The character itself is expertly created, but doesn't seem that hard to perform (i.e. you don't see layers to him or every aspect of his psyche), mainly because that's not being examined here. His friend, Azamat, is also well done, incorporating the stereotypes and worst parts of Kazakh culture (unnecessary drama, over-the-top reactions, constant blaming and complaining, etc.). My main criticism is the fight scene between Borat and Azamat, which is just...horrific and maybe the only place where they went too far. I was going to give this movie a lower rating, but it had the balls to venture into timely and debatable topics, which ultimately paid off (not without consequences, though), and I respect Sacha Baron Cohen and everyone else for that.",8,0,1,1 December 2017
Minority Report," One of Tom Cruise's best
","Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton in this somewhat lengthy but still really cool sci-fi crime film. I'd say this is one of his best movies, with a mix of awesome visuals and a good story with a solid performance from the lead. This movie reminds me a lot of The Fugitive from 9 years ago, with the constant chasing and mysteries being unravelled as the movie progresses. Spielberg mixes the futuristic time with raw emotion here.The futuristic designs looked pretty noice for a 2002 film and a bit unique, especially with the hover-car designs on those huge highways. Cruise's what- looks-like-a-stylised-Bugatti car was sleek and looked like something you'd think we'd have today but no. The sci-fi nature coincides with Spielberg's previous stuff (Spielberg is an automatic bonus in most cases) and I noticed someone from Band of Brothers (done by Spielberg too) in the movie too as one of Anderton's friends. They did spend a lot (and made a hefty profit), but did not rely on the effects to entertain - the dialogue was paid attention to, thankfully. There's also a hint of politics in the film.Colin Farrell (the mean guy from Fantastic Beasts) performed well as a cocky and young new agent almost trying to bring down the PreCrime unit, later leading the chase for Anderton. The interactions between him and Anderton showed a sort-of rivalry and pursuing Anderton gave Farrell's character (Danny Witwer) a sort of satisfaction (he tries to look for flaws and finds a human one). You almost kinda feel sorry for Anderton, when you see what he has to do, how low he has to go and how he was manipulated. His son is a key point in the movie and he's almost used like a toy for Anderton to grab at. Agatha was, at times, cryptic and annoying, but nonetheless helpful to Anderton in his search for the truth (couldn't think of a less cheesy way to put it). The situation that Anderton creates for the villain (who shall remain unnamed) is crafty, combining genius with passion. The ending was unfortunately a bit out of place, not really following the rest of the film, seeming rushed and understandably a main point of criticism.",9,0,0,23 November 2017
Nightcrawler," A routine yet quality performance from Jake Gyllenhaal
","This creepy yet engaging film features Jake Gyllenhaal as the main guy: a Sherlock-like character who is smart at getting what he wants but really does not know how to socialise. He also keeps his cool for most of the film and says kinda brutal stuff in that calm voice, making it sound more effective. The movie shows the lengths to which journalists go to (i.e. invading crime scenes) get stories and money. On top of that, Bloom (Gyllenhaal's character) is severely apathetic. Gyllenhaal definitely performed well as a desperate man turned desperado (in a way). This was also a rather simple movie (low budget, good performances and writing) and I like that (I hate overspending and then losing a ton of money). The music also fit the situations nicely, especially the montage of Bloom filming crime scenes, downloading video files and buying stuff (that particular bit was smooth and not too loud). Riz Ahmed (THE PILOT from Rogue One) later comes in and also fits his role as Rick, another desperate man, quite well - not having a lot of dialogue, but still having enough for people and Bloom to understand him. His California accent is also suitable. This movie's story is entertaining (proven by a nomination for Best Original Screenplay) and it's fun to see how much Bloom controls his world and the people around him, through whatever means necessary. I think my only criticism is Bloom's personal history not really being explained. Nonetheless, this movie's damn good.",9,1,1,23 November 2017
Justice League," Decent entertainment, but there's still a lot of room for improvement
","So, this obviously has quite a bit of stuff to unpack, being a huge movie - marketing, budget, time spent, scale, etc. I want to start by focusing on the points made on Wikipedia, then continuing from there into whatever else I have to say. The action sequences and performances were praised. Now, if you don't nail the action sequences in a SUPERHERO movie, it's not gonna be that good of a superhero movie. I'll admit, they were pretty well done (I don't think they were, 'chaotic,' as RT says); just perhaps done in excess (Zack Snyder tings) and unfortunately replacing proper character development.This leads into the performances, which were weirdly uneven across the team - I'd say Miller (The Flash) takes the top spot, with Momoa (Aquaman) getting second place. I think Cyborg (Fisher) had the least development in the team, and his character was partially boring, along with his somewhat dull performance. I get that the DCEU has already made movies for the 3 more significant members (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman), but you could've done a lot more and just spent more time on the movie (which is only 2 hours, not almost 3, as some prankster decided to show online). I mean, I would've liked to see what they could've done with almost 3 hours and a better director (PATTY JENKINS FFS), who might not have even needed that much time. Most of the development they try is weak (like interactions with parents and how the superheroes view themselves). This action/character imbalance is kind of expected from Snyder at this point (this will lead up to a point I make at the end). Now for the criticisms *cracks fingers* - a thin plot, weak villain and overuse of CGI. On the first point, I didn't exactly think the plot was bad, but I'm assuming, 'thin,' means a lack of depth, because that's certainly true. I could make the same point about the length - should've been longer to enhance the plot in some way. It was kind of the stereotyped superhero movie plot of some extraterrestrial being coming to destroy/conquer Earth, but ultimately losing because it's a movie (that's not a spoiler; you knew it was gonna happen)I'm not gonna say much about Steppenwolf now; I reckon that I'll kind of ruin him for you guys. The CGI, however, was EVERYWHERE. I do think that it was used unnecessarily at many points (action sequences, along with designs and aesthetics of locations, even Cyborg's looks) and that they should have used practical effects more often (the lack of it kinda screws with the physics on some occasions and makes situations seem unrealistic even by superhero movie standards). I get that you like to stylise your action, but keep it logical, otherwise you're just not really caring about rules and it's going to stand out in a bad way.The tone was very up-and-down, with some calling it lighter than before (yeah, kinda) but others calling it inconsistent (I agree with this more). It went from dark and dramatic (e.g. Diana's meh exposition about how Steppenwolf came to be) to comedic and more human (e.g. Flash just having fun with the others). You know, the funny thing is that because Snyder left the movie (his daughter died; I understand) early, they got in Joss Whedon (who directed THE AVENGERS) to direct some scenes, eventually getting a screenplay (writing) credit at the end. Given the styles of each director, it wouldn't be hard to pick out whom you would credit for certain scenes. I don't think Joss would be the type of guy to intentionally screw with DC to give Marvel a bonus (MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA) - DC's already in the gutter; Marvel need not worry. Because of the overall quality of the DCEU so far (except Wonder Woman - I know we have some critics here, but the general consensus is good), I just think that there was too much hype leading up to Justice League. I know that it's a big superhero movie and all the kids are gonna be excited, but none of the others (Patty Jenkins, you can leave the room now) have really nailed it like they should have. Sure, Justice League was an improvement over past efforts, but there's still a LOT of room for improvement. I'm not even thinking about Marvel comparisons here; the DCEU just needs to do justice (haha) to their huge superhero universe and upgrade itself as a movie franchise. Whether or not that'll happen, I'm not sure, because it seems like money is mostly their concern instead of actual film quality (even though higher quality can mean higher earnings). I don't care about the whole critics-VS-audiences thing; it's possible to make a movie that gets both of them (and Internet users) fired up (actually, Patty, come back for a moment, please). However, I do think the critics were a bit too harsh; I was expecting an RT score in the 40-60 range (it just barely gets in with 41%, not to mention a 42% difference between critics and audiences as of now).",8,1,11,23 November 2017
American Psycho," Strangely crafted film held together by Christian Bale's genius performance
","Kids, Bruce Wayne was a serial killer 5 years before he became Batman. Remember that. This movie is very brutal and creepy in pretty much all aspects. Patrick Bateman is a materialistic and shallow Wall Street dude by day and a murderer by night and his attitude doesn't even change much. None of the other characters seem to honestly care about him, nor does he care about them. However, the supporting cast still helps to build the atmosphere a lot and add to the story. He fits so well into his Wall Street life that nobody considers him to stand out. I don't class this as a horror film, but it is still graphic.After Bateman kills his first major victim in Paul Allen (Jared Letohnonobodycaresaboutyou) in a spectacular fashion (with older music accompanying him; a running theme), you assume that Bateman's experienced with cleaning up murders, given how well he does it to Allen. When the detective (Willem Dafoe, the Green Goblin from the original Spider Man films) arrives, you wonder how Bateman doesn't immediately trigger so many alarm bells. The conversations that Bateman has within his head are so fitting and very well written and add quite a lot to his character. Christian Bale's (at the head of two movies with 'American' in the title despite being English) performance is brilliant to the point where I have to give it its own rating of probably an 8.7/10. Patrick Bateman has been put alongside my favourite movie characters. He's a cool lunatic who just kills people in an insanely unique way.",8,0,0,3 December 2017
Drive," Gosling doesn't even need words to get the job done
","Even though Gosling (his character is unnamed) does not have a lot of dialogue, his facial expressions and body language do the work for him. Even when his accent starts to show when he speaks louder, it's very Californian. His typically stone-cold face contrasts with his cool smiles when he visits Irene and Benicio (and looks like he feels at home). He acts very professionally and strictly during his criminal job, showing how he ultimately has control over his clients. His determination and anger in the latter half of the film is evident and scary, especially with 2 threats he gives to different people. In both of those scenes, you can tell he's clearly going all in.Irene is sort of his interest and thankfully the relationship does not get awkward. They keep it moderate for a guy who doesn't show a lot of sentimentality. Gosling's chemistry with the kid, Benicio, is almost big-brother-like, where Gosling helps him out of the hole he's unknowingly in. Walter White plays Gosling's manager, who imagines Gosling as an asset to get money from the mobsters Bernie and Nino. Ron, I think, suits the always-angry type crime boss, only giving a damn about his business and reputation.The car chase scene is also slick, with Gosling keeping his cool (while his passenger swears and acts like a wuss), dodging civilians and performing a brilliant finishing move (FATALITY). The music is just brilliant - all of the tunes they use fit the situation so well, from one describing Gosling's help in Irene's life to an Inception-like tune when he pulls out a hammer (can't tell you when) to keeping it steady while adding to the mood of so many situations. The only things I would criticise are the unnecessarily graphic violence (WAY too much blood) and the strip club scene where no attempts are made to cover anything up.",9,0,0,24 November 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Can't complain about anything; unequivocally deserved Best Picture
","This movie is unorthodox in so many ways, but it works so brilliantly. From the random drum beats in the credits to the levitation and telekinesis, you will be confused and entertained. The writing/dialogue is excellent, accompanied by awesome performances by Michael Keaton (the original Batman), Ed Norton and the others. Also, if you had any questions about the title, watch the movie and you'll understand. Keaton plays a sort of veteran actor in a world full of real celebrities (Clooney, Renner, etc.) where he is desperate to get his career back on track by performing in a play involving love and cheating and the like. He is haunted by the inner voice of his past self (as Birdman), who insults and enrages him on multiple occasions. This inner voice, even though Riggan (Keaton's character) hates it, motivates him to get up from his low points in the film (e.g. sleeping on some stairs using a plastic bag as a pillow after drinking a pint of whiskey). The voice also makes him hallucinate about returning to Birdman (you'll see what happens). Keaton also puts conviction into these frustrated moments, whether it's towards life or someone else (like Norton's character, Mike or Tabitha, a reviewer, whom he hates). He portrays the struggling actor very well (earning him a Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination, both deserved) with enough raw emotion to be realistic, but not melodramatic. Norton (how this man has not won an Oscar in his career is insane) also fits his role as Mike amazingly - an egomaniac who doesn't want anyone to control him. He does and says so many weird and out-of-the-blue things, but they add to the character, showing you why the other cast members hate him. Granted, Mike is a good actor, but he's uncontrollable. He gets beaten up by Riggan for stealing a spot in the NYT, where Riggan convincingly proves his acting ability. Mike also teaches Riggan about some parts of life (like Riggan's internal voice) and almost embodies cynicism. Emma Stone (Best Supporting Actress nomination for this, which is fair) also works unexpectedly (given she typically plays friendly characters) well as his estranged, drug-addicted daughter who, like Mike, lashes out at Riggan about him being a poor father and how low she believes his life currently is. The camera work is also very crafty, appropriately using slow transitions and rapid swings, mainly between characters. Riggan flying and moving stuff around with his mind is fun to watch. It was great to see Zach Galifianakis get away from his usual light comedic roles and, like the others, swear, be angry and uptight as Riggan's mate and produce. Also, low budget. Yes. I really cannot think of anything to call poor; I just think that some may not like its unorthodox nature.",9,1,2,23 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Finally something good out of the DCEU (thanks to a lack of Zack Snyder)
","I think the story was fair, given that it fit Diana's naive nature (and it was about WW1, which you rarely see in films nowadays). I think the design of Themyscira was nice, not overdoing it, yet keeping true to their medieval nature (they fight on horseback with bows, swords, shields, armour and live in stone houses, so yeah). I was a bit confused when Hippolyta just let her go with Steve to the outside world (I just thought, 'You're not even gonna try? Really?'). I liked the fight sequences, where she purely seems angry (honestly) and goes through as many German soldiers (maybe a tad overdone) as she can. I have no qualms or complaints about the casting of Gadot. I also think that her and Nielsen being foreign (not from Britain, the US, Australia, etc.) was good - they didn't just make it boring, but they went a more exotic route that paid off (also, reading off the Wikipedia page, apparently Nicole Kidman was negotiating for the role - I definitely think Nielsen did a better job than Kidman could have). I also think that Pine, in the scene where he's being interrogated with the Lasso of Truth on Themyscira, talking to the Amazons and later Diana, handles it in an unbelievably calm fashion, so props to him for that. I'm also glad that Steve didn't just trash Diana's naivety whenever it came into play. I am very glad that there was actual humour in this damn movie - the rest of the DCEU didn't really have much at all. Chris Pine's existence and Diana's lack of knowledge about, 'man's world,' worked well together (along with supporting characters, like Steve's crew) to create those moments that brought a more lighthearted tone to the movie than the rest of the DCEU (which we needed). I think maybe they could've explored the emotional depth a bit more, given that part of the movie is about her realising the darkness of humans (that Steve repeatedly reinforces throughout the film). They also probably should've added the people (whom she and the others save) being confused and amazed rather than only thankful (because seeing someone with THAT kind of armour in 1918 would've baffled most). I think at certain points, she got melodramatic, emphasising grief and other negative emotions too much. Rotten Tomatoes describes her performance as, 'charismatic,' which I'm not honestly too sure about. I also thought that some of the dialogue relating to the drama could've been better.",8,5,8,23 November 2017
The Fighter," Assuming that 'Wahlberg + Bale + Adams = good' is correct
","Seeing Mark Wahlberg (Micky), Christian Bale (Dicky) and Amy Adams (Charlene) all in this movie immediately caught my eye and they all delivered in this rousing - yet somewhat expected - sports drama based on a true story. As I said, all the three above put in committed performances as very suburban and ordinary (and in her case, scrappy) people trying to honestly work their problems out. I would say Bale stands above them because he lost weight (already did that for The Machinist), delivered his lines authentically and created more of a mirror image of Dicky than the others did. Again, he's English, yet he nails the American character better than the others - amazing (no Batman rant yet) with a deserved win of Best Supporting Actor. Melissa Leo (whom I didn't mention plays Micky's mother) won Best Supporting Actress and I'm sort of torn between her and Adams - Leo had less screen time, but delivered a lot when she got it; whereas Adams had a bit more influence, still with solid acting (she got nominated, so it's something). The style of the movie is very realistic; David O. Russell cuts out all the BS and sappy nature of what this type of movie could hold to go for something simple, yet able to yield a lot. He abstains from some sort of brutal and destructive drama by keeping some humour and good heart in there. The music is also very fitting and awesome, and I've picked up Back In The Saddle by Aerosmith from it. Obviously, being a true story, there is a degree of predictability, but Russell works with - and gets the most out of - the unique parts of the journey to make this film as entertaining as it is. Also, I love the well-trained accents; they don't seem tryhard or overdone, especially for Wahlberg who is from Massachusetts, like Micky Ward. Even Bale (again, the Englishman) nails it. There isn't a lot to analyse or look into for this film, but it sure as hell impressed me.",9,1,1,27 November 2017
