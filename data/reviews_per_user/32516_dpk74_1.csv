The Blair Witch Project," With its hand-held camera work, special effects-free tension, and an aggressively deceptive marketing campaign from Artisan Entertainment, The Blair Witch Project is pure fiction!
","What a WASTE of time!! I tried and tried to get into this movie since it's limited release to only get turned away by the 'SOLD OUT' display FLASHING on the AMC Show time Board. Finally I had my girlfriend called at noon for a 10pm showing and paid $8.50 per ticket just to sit and watch a very BORING so-called horror flic. All these idiots of the press keep saying how 'SCARY' this movie is. The only part of the movie that was remotley scary was thelast 3 minutes. If you haven't seen it yet......DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Maybe I'll become the BLAIR WITCH and hunt down Heather, Mike, and Josh and KILL THEM MYSELF!!!!!! *LOL*",Null,0,1,29 July 1999
