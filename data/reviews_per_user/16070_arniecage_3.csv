Hereditary," Terrifying
","Could just be the best horror film this year. The actors were superb. Toni Colette was amazing as Annie. I was gripped early on, and soon unsettled by what I saw happening in front of me. This isn't your typical horror film filled with half a dozen jump scares, but a film which cranks up the tension until it reaches an unbearable conclusion. I can't wait to see what Ari Aster does next.",9,23,47,16 June 2018
Us," A Near Perfect Horror Film
","I preferred Us to Get Out as it was more of a traditional horror film. To start, some of the issues in a lot of horror films are present here, ie characters making poor decisions. But I guess if they weren't to make those poor decisions, we wouldn't have the film. I like the comedic elements and the way they were interwoven into the story, although I did think there was a bit too much comedy present in the film. But those are my only gripes. Lupita, Winston, and the children all give a remarkable performance as both the good and evil side of themselves. I don't think I've ever seen a better performance from Lupita in fact. I will definitely be watching this one again soon. I feel it will be even better after a second viewing. 9/10.",9,4,6,3 April 2019
Split," James McAvoy Carries This Film
","A fantastic performance by the film's star, James McAvoy is reason alone to watch this film. Every personality on display is distinct to the other, and he is so interesting to watch. Anya who was breath-taking in The Witch does a fine job here too. This is a film where M. Night Shyamalan reasserts himself as a serious director following a string of poor films. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel and the conclusion of the Unbreakable series arriving in January. 8.5/10.",8,182,204,2 July 2018
