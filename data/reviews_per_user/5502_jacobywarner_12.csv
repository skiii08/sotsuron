The Devil's Advocate," Wrongfully Forgotten... or a Well Kept Secret?
","This stylish drama is a relative well kept secret of sorts, given that I wasn't even born when this movie was in theaters I was still able to see this movie at a time where it was still relevant. That being said I think this movie is a great representation of the times that the US was facing, a time of government elitism with big corporations taking advantage of the little guy. These themes are very explicitly present in the implicit meanings behind the story.An incredible performance by both Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino bring life to a very well developed script, shot in a very high contrast metallic style reflecting the stories demonic vibe.I give this movie an 8/10 and recommend it to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas with a touch of sci-fi fantasy.",8,0,0,27 November 2019
The Babadook," Not Your Cheap Jump Scare Thriller
","This is a representation of how a psychological horror movie is supposed to be. A product of German Expressionism with some Surrealist tones, this is a true visual experience with a unique stylistic approach.A troubled mother struggling with grief finds herself at the mercy of her own fear and the fear of her son. This is a truly terrifying thought, that we as humans are able to plague our own lives causing our own destruction. Thus this movie is far beyond the simple minded fear of death, it is about the fear of living and I think this is a way for the filmmaker to tackle a very real problem today and that is of depression.I found myself thinking about this movie for several days after watching it the first time until I finally sat down and watched it again, and despite some underexposed shots I still think that this film deserves an 8/10.",8,2,3,26 November 2019
Knives Out," Absolutely Genius... One of My Favorite Movies of the Year
","Wow! I just got out of the theater and I can honestly say this movie was absolutely perfect, there was humor that wasn't forced, pauses that weren't rushed, all connected with brilliant sound design. This is an absolute gem and I 100% think that is deserves a lot more praise than I have been seeing in reviews.I want to start by giving props to the editor, this movie really allowed for pauses to build tension and create a very slow burning rhythm that compliments the story pushing both the stylistic and narrative components to further heights. However this is also a direct result of the preparation and execution of Rian Johnson and Steve Yedlin when it came to the production process. They use delayed whip pans to really give a very unique whimsical feeling when watching the film, this along with slow zooms and low angle shots advance the audiences perception of the cinematic world. Also I would like to add that this film has more ways of filming someone walking down a hallway than I thought possible. I think that it is important to also bring up the actors performances, I have to admit that after watching the trailers I dreaded seeing Chris Evans in his role as a deviant troublemaker because they cut out the most out of context lines creating a very cringe trailer but after seeing the film this couldn't be farther from the truth. He really broke out of his Captain America phase bringing a very noticeable stage presence, but Ana de Armas stole the show. She proved that she is not just a supporting actress giving a both developed and mature performance. It didn't hurt staring alongside the established actor Daniel Craig.With all that being said I am rating this film a 9/10 because the final product is a fun experience that has something for everyone.",9,1,3,28 November 2019
The Irishman," Incredible Craft with a Poor Pace
","Turning on this picture my attention was all on the screen, but as the film progressed I suddenly found that my eyes were more focussed on my cellphone just counting the minutes till this movie would end. So after my first viewing I came to the conclusion that it was not the film that was the problem, it had to be me so I decided to watch the film again without my phone in my pocket. Without distraction I still had wondering eyes meaning that it in fact wasn't me.So before I jump into the bad I will start with the good. Every set had immense detail, it was not quite the on location type of pictures that we have grown to expect from Martin Scorsese. Another great aspect to the film would be the score that he uses, he has always been an expert when it comes to his use of music and this movie is no exception. I think that one aspect of the story that I did enjoy was the way they incorporated the political climate of the time showing how corrupt all politicians were and have always been.Now on to the Bad. Acting... with such an incredible lineup of great actors it just seemed like they were going through the motions. The one exception to this movie would be the performance of Joe Pesci who played a very reserved character that we don't often see from him. Another poor aspect from the film would be the story itself, not only is it unbearably long there are many scenes that aren't important to the plot. This not only creates some problems but with the editing style that they chose to employ had a terrible pace. This for me was the absolute worst part of the movie, there were cuts where there should have been pauses and pauses where there should have been cuts.It is for those reasons that I am only giving this movie a 7/10, I also just want to add that it just didn't have the Martin Scorsese vibe that we as fans were craving when this movie was announced. I personally was very upset after watching this film and writing this review really upsets me but I am going to overhype a movie just because of the director.",7,2,7,29 November 2019
The Shining," Visually Chilling Masterpiece - Kubrick's Best Film
","Before I start I am going to say that I am not qualified to truly discuss this film because it would be the equivalent of someone who doodles analyzing the works of Picasso or Van Gogh so I am going to make this a short one.Every shot is a painting in this film creating an absolutely breathtaking product which leaves literal goosebumps up your arms, and it is important to mention his use of the steady cam revolutionizing the way filmmakers will film from now until the foreseen future. The films visuals are equally matched by Jack Nichols decent into madness, with one of the most complex stories of all time.This is one of the most important movies ever made and that is why I give this movie a 9/10.",9,2,2,26 November 2019
American History X," A Brutally Raw Take on a Sensitive Topic
","What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.But before I rate this film I would like to say that I was not a fan of the aspect ratio they chose to use, I know that this might not be the largest detail but I still wanted to bring it up. But I digress, so I chose to give this film a 8/10 just because I think there are a couple parts where it gets a little choppy and over narrated.",8,2,2,26 November 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Awesome, Quirky, and Engaging... Just Edgar Wright Being His Edgar Wright Self
","In this incredibly stylistic comic book superhero comedy, 'Scott Pilgrim' a young adult who in order to court one 'Ramona Flowers'(an American who is running from her past) is tasked with fighting her ex-boyfriends.Edgar Wright executed every single part of this film perfectly starting with the writing, this film had a very unique style that all kicked off with the perfect first narrated line 'Not so long ago... In the mysterious land... Of Toronto, Canada... Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler' which set the tone for the truly original narrative to come. The story is equally matched with an editing style that is well suited to the story furthering the narrative, and I think it is crucial to mention his inventive transitions which shows Edgar Wrights extraordinary vision in the pre-production process. Casting is another category where this movie exceeds, Now I know that many people have developed a stigma around Michael Cera labeling him a character actor who plays the lovable all American nerd, but this should not diminish the fact that his awkward stage presence fitting his role. Besides he played a Canadian character.Now I must admit that I am a huge admirer of Edgar Wright and all his work, but I find that he is very consistent in always creating an enjoyable viewing experience without ever repeating himself, and it is for that reason that I chose to give this movie an 8.",8,0,0,26 November 2019
It Follows," Utterly Horrifying
","This film is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen, feeding on the primal fear of the unknown. A predator whose soul purpose is to hunt down their prey, no need for food or sleep just the relentless pursuit. This brings on a fear that everyone knows, the sense of someone or something rather following you causing you to constantly look over your shoulder. This along side the fact that you never know what you are looking for adds a whole other level of paranoia.That being said I give this film an 8/10 because the days following my viewing I found myself constantly looking over my own shoulder thinking about the endless pursuit.",8,0,0,26 November 2019
Frozen," Perfect... A Feat For Animation
","Now I know that this movie is already hailed as not only one of the best animated movies, but as one of the best movies ever made. So believe me... I know I am jumping on the bandwagon but for good reason.The animation was flawless, the casting was perfect, the story strong and heart felt, all lead by the vision of Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. So with that being said there is no weak link in this production, and it is for that reason that I am more than happy to jump on the bandwagon.Watching this film for what seemed to be the 100th time I still can't get over the world that the animators were able to craft, the colors were vibrant and the sets were on point to the last detail.The heart and soul of all the characters were matched with the perfect actors who were able to embody their characters with perfect pitch. The character arcs were complex without being too complicated and despite the cheesiness of the typical 'act of true love' the story was still able to tweak the expected.So I chose to give this movie a 9/10 because movies like this don't come along all that often.",9,1,3,27 November 2019
La La Land," Enjoyable but Slow
","This film gets off to a relative poor start with an extremely obnoxious dance number that goes on for what seems like an eternity, thus placing the audience in a poor mood to watch the film.So let me start by saying that I did enjoy the film and would watch it again after fast forwarding the first scene, I think that it is a film that has a simple romance story that is very reminiscent of 500 Days of Summer however it fails to accomplish the themes that 500 Days of Summer exceeds in.As a result of that I am only giving it a 7/10 also known as a C for average.",7,0,4,27 November 2019
Parasite," Modern Day Metropolis
","This is a must see film packed with tons of implied meaning tackling many social issues focussing on the wealth gap. However the implied message behind the movie is also matching with a complex base level story which surprises the audience with every passing moment. No I know that many people are turned off at the sight of subtitles, but I hope that if this is the only factor keeping you from watching this movie, I beg you to overlook it and enjoy this incredible cinematic experience.I think that this movie has a really unique way of showing the gaps between the social classes that exist. I find that just like Metropolis there are several consistencies between the two, but at the base of this there is one single theme; The rich despite relying on the working class often take advantage of them. Now this movie may have gone to the extreme showing how some people just can't take the oppression and they eventually crack but I think that it was important for the filmmaker to show how social conditions set up the downtrodden to fail.I absolutely loved how this movie developed and found myself watching it three times in a row ad each time I discovered a new feeling for the film. So that being said I gave this movie a 9/10 because I think that with every viewing there is more to take away from this film.",9,5,11,26 November 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," A Deep Take on the Stereotypical Horror Film, Breaking the Recipe - Let Me Explain...
","I think that despite the overall typical horror movie aesthetic, there is nothing ordinary about this film. Taking a once overused recipe and creating a brand new take on the slasher genre, not only emphasizing every horror movie stereotype but also creating a world where their every mistake actually has reason behind it.Now what most people think of as a gimicky twist I find to be a very original take on the old horror films. The way that Drew Goddard uses the 'Gods' of the world as a direct representation of the viewers that watch over the world that is horror films. This struck me as brilliant because it shows how we as the viewers crave the same plot line, we want the crazed 'girl' to die first, followed by the 'Stoner,' then the 'Jock,' after that the lovable 'geek,' then finally the 'final girl.' However when this does not occur we as the audience revolt thus destroying the movie world.I found this to be an awesome homage to the old horror films that I grew up loving and because of that plus the deeper themes that exists I chose to give this film an 8/10.",8,19,28,26 November 2019
