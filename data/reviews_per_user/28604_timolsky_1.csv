Casablanca," You can't really begin to describe genius
","There simply isn't space to say quite how wonderful Casablanca is, so I'll try and keep this short.Simply seeing it reminds you of why you can fall completely in love with cinema.Not a scene is wasted, not a character un-fulfilled and not a single line could be re-written.The greatest moment, it's nigh on impossible, but try the moment when Rick tells Sam 'I told you never to play that song' and see how his face says more in his look at Ilsa than any other film could hope to say in words or pictures.Wonderful.Just sit and watch it. Laugh at some bits, cry at others and then do both at the end.And then go and watch it again.You can never have watched Casablanca too many times.Bliss.",Null,0,0,10 July 2000
