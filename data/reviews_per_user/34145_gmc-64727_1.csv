Men in Black 3," Outstanding!!!
",Better then the original. Fresh concept and just plain fun to watch. The 'aliens' are funny and better looking then Star Wars! K & J are still great chemistry and I hope they have a Men in Black 4! Josh Brolin is a perfect young K. Outstanding fun to watch more then a few times! I guess K's love interest could have been on the screen a little longer? I was surprised that J didn't have one this time but the concept works well without it and the show is about K.,10,0,4,5 July 2017
