Blade Runner 2049," The movie from another time
","This movie is simply awesome. Let's just say plain and simple: THE NEW BLADE RUNNER IS A SCI-FI POEM. It is poetry, it is the story we waited for so long. As you bite more and more trying to reach the centered cream of one colored expensive cake, you become more and more addicted with the restaurant you traveled to enjoy it. If we all waited in vain for Harrison, the Ryan character is reaching thru us step by step. The Oscars are carved deep into this title.Cross our fingers for it. Not seeing the first Blade Runner is a blasphemy ;) Do not go to see this title, or your sense will be fooled like the dumb-ass teenagers that walked out from it bored after 30 min",10,6,17,8 October 2017
