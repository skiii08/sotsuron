Requiem for a Dream," words cannot describe
","This movie brilliantly delved into the psyche of drug addiction.  It's not a movie for those who expect wonderfully happy endings, as Hollywood so endlessly gives us; it in fact, is one of the best portrayals of drug usage I have ever seen.  Requiem is one of those movies that you only really understand, if you have been through it yourself.  To be able to say, yes I have done that, I know why they need to sell drugs, and why they can't seem to get on top; or say, yeah, I can fathom why she needs to take herself to that quintessential place and hurt herself like that; that is what it takes for you to 'get' this movie.",10,0,1,26 September 2002
