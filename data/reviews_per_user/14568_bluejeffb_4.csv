It," What a tragic mess
","Really didn't want to have to compare it to the original TV mini series but ultimately it's inevitable.
I think most fans of the book thought the original adaptation was generally very good but had it's faults, not violent enough for one thing and a poor ending, although to be fair Stephen King doesn't write endings which are all that easy for film-makers to replicate.
One thing the TV version did do though is capture the magic surrounding the kids and their almost complete togetherness as a collection of 'losers'. No disrespect to the young actors here but they simply are not on the same level as those of 30 years ago. Also, Beverley looks 5 years older than the boys for one thing !!!
And why rip up so much of the book's important story lines and then have different characters saying things which originally belonged to another. I know this was done by Peter Jackson in the LOTR trilogy but it was done in a very logical way which helped the films continuity.
And the comparisons to Tim Curry's Pennywise aren't even worth starting !
Such a let down after all this time.
Worst thing is I've now got to pick myself up and watch the 2nd part.
After that, it's gonna be another re-read and then re-watch the mini series just to make me feel better.
Such a let down after all this time waiting.",3,1,1,23 March 2020
Stardust," A fairy tale for adults
","An excellent book adapted in to an excellent film. Magical, enchanting, funny.
A top cast with a relative unknown, although superb, lead actor.
Fantastic adaptation of another magical Neil Gaiman story. Yes, there are differences, most notably, the ending, but it was a fairly quiet finish to the boo, in a movie it needs to be bigger. A few things are missing, the little hairy man who helps Tristran, the fight between the Unicorn and the Lion, but these weren't necessary and at the end of the day they're still in the book for you to revisit.
If you love fantasy and magic it's a must watch. Superb",8,3,3,21 February 2019
The Evil Dead," pure class
","How this film doesn't appear in the top 250 is beyond me. Silence of the Lambs at number 2 - give me a break! Evil Dead put the H back in Horror films, it shocked people, it scared people and just below the surface was the humour - used much more in the sequels. It also contained one of THE great performances from, at the time, an unknown Bruce Campbell who went on to show how good he is in Evil Dead 2. Yes it was low budget, but the makers never tried to do too much with their limited resources, simply concentrating on scaring the living daylights out of the viewer. The last great horror film before Wes Craven decided horror was only for kids (Scream,Wishmaster etc).",9,1,2,11 June 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," Pure enjoyment
","Nice twist on a tried and tested formula. Not really for those who just want to be scared - it's got as many laughs as jumps - but still a very well thought out horror film.
Fairly common premise at the start - group of youngsters go to a creepy cabin - but then it's like Quentin Tarantino turned up on set to add his opinion.
Very enjoyable, lots of fun. Well worth a look",8,1,3,26 February 2020
