Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Dramatic. Satisfying.
","I'd like to mention this at the beginning of the review that I honestly did not like Vol. 1 but this movie made me change my opinion. The reason merely being the connection of the story and characters (even though not much). Important thing was Bill actually was a good character and my favourite characters in the movie. Because he feels like one of us. Too sentimental, possessive and optimistic like every other being. David played it brilliantly. I wanted this movie to be more longer and passionate than it is.
I don't know if I really should talk about the performances because there is nothing to disapprove with it. That shouldn't be a problem to you.
Well-scripted, well-presented.
Watch both the volumes together or watch neither.",8,0,0,23 March 2020
Knives Out," Standard storyline
",Story wasn't too unique and becomes more and more predictable as it progresses. But I also think rating it less than 8 would be unfair.,8,0,1,20 December 2019
The Irishman," A Typical Scorcese.
","There was no specific character building which I was expecting since it's such a long movie. You go with the story and sometimes the scenes are too stretched or are even unnecessary at time. Scorcese could've easily mould it into a 2 - 2:30hr movie but maybe that was important according to his perspective. The movie goes quite normal till 1hr then the protagonist is like perplexed and doubtful of his own company/people he is with. It does not show but maybe that was happened when he took a different turn because his other friend made him understand that way. Story was derived from a book, so I guess this is the best it could've been. There's no way you won't like it if you liked Goodfellas. Only thing, here's no substance involved. Maybe you'll wanna watch it for Scorcese. I'm gonna conclude it's a solid 8 from me.",8,2,7,8 February 2020
X-Men," Pretty average but gives a good start to the X-Men francise
","Not anywhere near best of Bryan Singer. That man has great potential and I seriously like his subtle yet so flattering direction. The movie lacks good action choreography, which some some of you may disagree with because it's the time it was made. But I'd seriously like to bring this up that many other movies did good action before 2000s or even 90s.Anyways I really wasn't hoping much from the action side but story-wise I must say I was expecting a lot. The first half of the story is not that common or used as much, but, the second half, you already know what's gonna happen. As I mentioned before, good for the beginning of the francise (not considering comics or any other references/adaptations). You'd want watch the next movie for some reason but not desperately.The casting is brilliant of course with popular names are already seen to play the major roles and their characters and performance was at par good. I liked it I would of course love to watch more from these.I won't recommend this movie but if you want to start a series of movies this won't disappoint I hope. But naah! I'd say don't watch, just go through some YouTube videos (hardly 10mins) to know about the whole story.",6,1,1,20 April 2020
Doctor Strange," Not very ideal kind of origin/introduction movie
","I was confused between 6 & 7 rating. Well, he's a passionate doctor but life takes turns and he ends up in quite a mess and all, that's cool. The struggles he faced weren't presented up to the mark (I mean that could've been a point where people would give into the character) and he was distracted from his motto (getting his hand better and normal) many times for such a passionate human leading a normal life. Performances were good.
I did not like the story & direction but I surely liked few of the segments and animation throughout. It won't do harm if you watch it randomly. *This is totally an unbiased review*",6,1,1,29 December 2019
LÃ©on: The Professional," Makes it a perfect 8 movie...
","I was actually surprised when I realised that the plot was not very unique or different but was still engaging somehow. I didn't like it the best and neither I say it's a must watch but definitely recommended if you ask me. Talking about performances, they never gave a chance to complaint. Maybe few of you won't like Reno but he was low-key good. Not necessary to watch if you're looking into some quality content in a movie, but rather something emotional and maybe a little gunfights.",8,0,0,26 February 2020
The Machinist," If you've watched fight club then this won't be surprising
","I found it to be quite analogical to fight club but instead, my best guess, they deliberately pointed out he was kind of troubled and needed to sort out everything.
It's funny how your routine, if not followed properly, will affect you this much and that's quite acceptable.
I didn't feel this was something brilliant but was well served to the audience.
Only if I had watched this before fight club, I would have definitely liked it more.
Not to be ignored, Christian Bale with his 'leaner' body (must have definitely faced problems then) portrayed it brilliantly and you can't just deny that!",7,0,1,2 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Seems out of context but isn't.
","The movie is only better if you know what it is actually about. When I watched it I understood about the protagonists' lives but later understood through a friend that it was actually about a particular event with that particular actor that isn't even the protagonist. I won't reveal much about the story but again somewhat of a typical Tarantino. Maybe the first movie where I actually liked Leo's acting without objection. Of course, Pitt, Robbie, etc were great but maybe Leo was exceptional because maybe he knew what he had to do. The plot connects very well altogether at the end. You might wanna watch it for numerous reasons.",8,1,1,8 February 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Full of action but contains least of the story. A walkthrough.
","I was disappointed by the fact that the story (of Vol. 1) was about only action and did not have much of the story involved.Uma Thurman kills only two of her enemies in Vol. 1 and which takes about 1:45:00 hrs of yours which is highly undesirable. Chronologically the first enemy takes about 45 mins of the movie and the second enemy dies in 10 mins of the movie. Which I think was maybe exaggeration of the first enemy (fact that the first enemy actually doesn't fight with Uma Thurman for 45 mins but the action sequence is that long).What I would suggest you is when the fights get too long, you skip it because it won't affect your story (make sure the dialogues are covered. Which aren't many, so yeah you can skip). Maybe you'll need to skip from 00:56:00 to 1:35:00 of the movie because it is literally worthless if you're not looking for and action movie.Then at the end is the important part. And most importantly, you don't see David (Bill) in Vol. 1. *This was just a walkthrough for you all because I seriously don't think it is worth the time if you don't like action or to be precise 90s action.* If the story wasn't linked to Vol.2 I'd seriously despise this one.But brilliant direction on a separate note!",7,0,0,20 March 2020
When Harry Met Sally...," Unique. Well written. This is just what your heart wants when you are feeling light at hear.
","The title gives you a very wrong impression that this movie is gonna be typical and annoying kind. I felt that too. But I'm gonna say that when I finished the movie I was in total disagreement with my previous self. I won't say this wasn't typical but it had some good laughs. Most importantly, Harry (Billy Crystal) was quite amusing and a charismatic character with whom I wanted to stick with throughout. He uncovers some fine secrets of life while he's being funny at the same time. I mean being subtle at its best. That was really lovely. Of course I won't talk about his performance, he felt like quite real to me. Sally (Meg Ryan), on the other hand, wasn't that appealing to me. Now some of you might contradict me and I totally agree with you too. What I really want to say is the character she plays is quite real too. You have many Sally's around you, you might have been in a relationship with her too, but performance wise I thought she was a little under-ethusiastic. She could've done better. Supporting cast and characters were good too.On a short note I liked the movie, the writing, direction, they might have missed some details but can be totally neglected. Watch it with your boyfriend/girlfriend or spouse or the best partner would be your OPPOSITE GENDER BEST FRIEND if you may. Keep it at the very bottom of you watchlist but don't miss this.",8,1,2,20 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Use me as a 'wanted to know about the Oscar winner' button
","Makes a great story. Seems quite realistic because if you imagine the way a training FBI agent asked to help on a case. Maybe these are the same situations or circumstances he/she may go through. Feels incomplete on a wide basis but to point one of it is they did not explore the Joker-Batman relationship between Starling and Letcher (that's how I see it). They could have made a whole new standalone film on them or anything relevant.
Performances were great. Maybe if you don't like the 80s 90s acting you'd probably disagree with me here. I mean there is nothing likely you'd hate about this movie maybe because it wasn't that effective but had potential. Jonathan Deemme definitely might have been a fan of the book. That's the only reason I could think of this movie not reaching that level.",8,0,0,23 March 2020
Her," 'Anime' as I like to describe it.
","You know Kimi no Nawa. (Your name.) is an anime movie where you open up to the director's imagination with a great plot/story. This movie is somewhat like it. I liked it. I typically do not like movies other than Drama-Thriller-Mystery genre but this movie only includes some drama at times and that's digestible I'll say. Great plot with great performances. I myself watched it for Joaquin but then I liked Amy too and Scarlett's role in this movie is special. She did it exceptionally well! I think you'll wanna watch it for the star cast and of course if you want to explore other than the regular content then this is the movie. You might lose track because it is not too engaging but then again, if you watch anime then that is not your concern as such!",8,0,0,8 February 2020
