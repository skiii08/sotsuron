Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very surprised AND intrigued!
","I'm not a die hard fan of SW (a huge John Williams fan, however), but I do enjoy science fiction.  So it was inevitable that I was going to see this movie, although I waited nearly a month before I did see it (on the largest screen in Texas, I might add).After seeing the film, I left with these thoughts.The special FX were AMAZING!  I had to pinch myself often to realize that what I was watching was computer generated and not real (i.e., the federation droid forces walking around along- side humans).The plot, especially at the beginning, seemed TOO FAST.  I had to watch it a second time to realize what all was happening in the first 10 minutes of the movie.  (But also to 'understand' what many characters like Jar Jar and the trade federation officials were saying.)However, the overall plot for the entire movie and the establishment of characters drew me right in.  And the one thing I kept saying upon leaving the theater was 'when can I see the next one?!'  There were so many questions left unanswered, so many story lines left unfinished, character interests and developments yet to be seen (how does this innocent boy turn to the dark side?  Does Obi Won fail in his training?, etc.)!  I am intrigued and CAN NOT wait to see how this all turns out.  This was an EXCELLENT way to end a movie, leaving everyone panting for the next one in order to fill the answers in the first.  I loved it!  My imagination is running wild.Of course, the music was INCREDIBLE and really added depth and excitement to the final jedi/dark side duel at the end.  It totally sucked me in.  GREAT job Williams.It's a great movie overall.  See it on the big screen definitely!  Can't wait for the next one!",9,5,7,10 June 1999
