Conquest 1453," The amazing story of the Conquest of Istanbul ( Constantinople )...
","This was the most expensive production for the Turkish Cinema yet, USD 17M, an amount which is almost nothing compared to the great productions of the US cinema. But I don't see ( and I'm sure you won't see if you watch it yourself ) too much difference compared to the ones produced over USD 100M. That means this is really a very good, effective and intelligent production, thanks to the production team. It is almost impossible to make a historic film with a totally objective view, depending who's eye you see through, but some movies almost succeed to do it ( or at least make you believe it tells the truth ). This one's near to that, and I hope everyone will be satisfied with the result. Faith Sultan Mehmet, the Conquerer was one of the youngest and well educated sultans of the Ottoman State, a brave one as well as an intelligent and ambitious sultan that made the impossible, possible. The movie takes it from the very beginning and ends with the conquer. Yet it also tells the true structure of the Ottoman Empire, giving freedom of religion & belief to all people it covers under its wings. He is the sultan who even gave his consent for an Italian painter to make his own portrait which seems pretty surprising considering the rules of Islam. The Ottoman Empire is not a Turkish Empire, but an Empire that embraced all nations & blood inside its borders. You can say it was the USA of their era. The movie doesn't reflect that as it must, but you know it is a Turkish movie. The content of the film is what all you expect from a historic movie, majestic & violent war scenes as well as plots & some love. But the transitions are just right and the tempo never makes you loose your concentration. As a result, this is a beautiful movie which will both entertain & inform you on an advanced level. Bravo Faruk Aksoy... You've already got your reward with the record number of spectators and a really profitable job.",9,14,35,4 August 2012
Coffee and Cigarettes," Do not waste your time...17 years are already wasted.
","When I first watched 'Coffee And Cigarettes', I was hoping to watch pleasing short stories with some humour and a good cam use with B&W. Neither of that happened. It's a total waste in my humble opinion. It is a waste of time, precious actors and actresses and 17 years of the director too. Now that you may like 'art films' but this one's not even that. While we watch it we thought even we could make a better one in the family. Don't get me wrong, but only a bright idea or a fine cast cannot guarantee a movie to be an unforgettable one. I'll go for other movies of the director, perhaps he's got a better one with his reputation. 5 over 10 won't be unfair.At least a link between all stories other than coffee and cigarettes would be great. Even all the coffees consumed in the movie do not seem delicious though there's some glamour in the cigarettes :)) I would also like to hear the director's own comments to get a better idea.",Null,3,6,24 November 2004
Life of Pi," A Magestic Journey inside a Dream
","This is perhaps one of the most spectacular movies of 2012, in every aspect. Best of Ang Lee up today... Cinema is the dream factory of the human mind and he did a marvelous job with adding a meaning to it.Forget all about the special effects you've ever seen in a movie, this one dazzles you in every scene... It is an effort to reach the unreachable, but it's there right in front of your eyes.So aesthetic that some scenes including the credits are each a wonderful painting themselves...I won't bother to tell the story, or what 'The Story of Pi' is trying to tell you, but if you watch it, you'll see that you're awakened from a colorful dream of your life.I wish I'll hear the words : 'And the Oscar goes to the Story of Pi and Ang Lee...' Thanks to all who've contributed this movie, the cast, the producers, the technical team, the cinematographers and perhaps to Ang Lee...",10,2,5,17 February 2013
Moulin Rouge!," Best musical since The Sound Of Music
","Moulin Rouge is perhaps the best musical since The Sound Of Music. Not in the same league, but not in the same league with any other musicals either. The idea of using the best love songs of all time to form a musical seems inconvenient, but it really works out. Nicole Kidman's performance is superb is as her astounding voice & fragile esthetic physical appearence. She'll be one of the Academy Award nominees without a doubt. Ewan McGregor is the weakest link but Jim Broadbent must be another Academy nominee with his ecstatic performance at his age. Baz Luhrmann made an effort to create a masterpiece and he's done it. I hope the Academy gives this effort what it deserves.",10,0,1,12 January 2002
The Queen," A real acting from Helen Mirren...
","Very humanistic angle of look to the 1997 events and what they brought to the Royal Family. Helen Mirren is at her best as Queeen Elizabeth, so are almost all the cast as well as Stephen Frear with his wonderful work, with no exaggeration and a perfect continuity. After watching the movie, I hope everyone will be more respectful to Her Majesty with a royal appearance.James Cromwell is one of the best castings as Prince Philip and does his job well without a show off. Michael Sheen is perhaps a lighter side of Tony Blair, or pretends to be, Alex Jennings without any resemblance to Prince Charles also does it with all gestures and talk.This is truly a movie of Queen Elizabeth, or better to say Helen Mirren who's marvelous both with her resemblance and act.People still wondering why there's still monarchy in England must watch the movie carefully, and learn. Dignity and royalness are not virtues to be learned, but are there for centuries.Well done Stephen Frear on such a documentary / movie that takes you in and does not let you out till the end.",9,0,1,19 November 2006
