Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good but not great
","As a stand alone action/drama, Kill Bill Vol.2 can be held against any film of this kind & would compare favourable. Which was why I had a problem with it. The standards that Mr Tarantino set in the first volume come no where near to being matched in terms of impact, style or balls. Don't get me wrong, KBV2 has some truly wonderful set pieces (the eye popping trailer catfight between Uma Thurman's Bride & Darryl Hannah's Elle Driver standing out) and some typical Tarantino humour. The performances are top notch too. Particularly David Carradine who portrays Bill with dignity & menace in equal measures. The problem I had with this film is that it's trying too hard to be a Tarantino film. It's packed with unneccesary dialogue that is trying to be cool & snappy (a usual QT trademark) yet over does it. Lines like 'wakey wakey eggs & bakey' sound contrived, as if it is someone trying to write like Tarantino, rather than the man himself. And QT seems to have taken his directing style straight from the Sergio Leone school of film making. (The camera dollying out of the church to show the 4 assasins waiting out side is ripped out of most of Leone's spaghetti westerns) It's ok to parody someone, but to pilfer someone in this fashion feels a bit cheap. That said, it's still well worth a look. Especially if you've seen the first installment, as the characters are fleshed out a bit more & aren't as cartoony as in they were in Volume 1. You also get a cracking good flash back when the Bride is sent to train with Master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). If however you haven't seen Volume 1 don't bother seeing it because it will probably confuse the hell out of you. Overall, it is a film that is peppered with genius yet falls short of expectations.",6,0,1,2 May 2004
Spider-Man 2," Uncle Sam (Raimi) needs you... to see this film.
","I'm sitting at my computer, trying to think of things to say about this film without sounding as though Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire were my lovers & this movie was the greatest sexual experience of my life. It's that good. I have read all the reviews and heard ordinary people wax lyrical about this film, but no one has done it justice. This is almost perfect film making. It is actually a summer blockbuster that has the brains to match its considerable brawn. The story picks up 2 years after the first movie with Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) struggling to make ends meet as he juggles life as a student, pizza delivery boy and superhero. Along with this, he still pine's after Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and is getting increasingly frustrated at not being able to tell his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) that his father was the Green Goblin and wasn't murdered by Spider-Man. Harry Osborn is now the head of Oscorp scientific research department, previously ran by his father, where he is funding the genius Dr Otto Octavius' work on creating a new form of energy that sustains itself therefore creating cheaper safer electricity for the world. Things go wrong for Dr Octavius when he demonstrates the creation of this new energy using 4 metal tentacles that are attached to his torso that he controls with his mind. He loses control of these in an accident, that also kills his wife & they proceed to take over his mind and his body. After this all hell breaks loose as Doc Oc, as he is now known as courtesy of J.Jonah Jameson (J.K.Simmons) the editor of the Daily Bugle, goes on a rampage of robbery and destruction. OK, so its hardly Shakespeare. But you don't expect or even want the Bard when you are watching a summer blockbuster about a superhero. But when you've got a director with the talent and balls of Sam Raimi you know it will be more than your usual no-brainer, CG heavy, popcorn toss-fest (Van Helsing anyone?). This man just gets better & better. Here is a man who has managed to keep his cult status and low budget sensibilities, yet produce a dazzling, eye-popping visceral thrill ride that not only leaves you breathless, but makes you care for its main characters. He has also been able to incorporate some of his trade mark visual quirks to please his Evil Dead fan-boy fan base. When Doc Oc's tentacles go on a rampage in an operating theater, you have a tentacle cam flying towards a chainsaw wielding surgeon. You half expected Bruce Campbell to be the surgeon (he pops up later on in his usual Sam Raimi cameo). You also see Raimi's love of slapstick shine through in a memorable pizza delivery sequence. But for all the impressive visuals & stunning action set-pieces, the elevated train smack down between Spidey & Doc Oc is worth the entrance fee, it's the smaller moments that make this film. The moments when you see Peter Parker at his most vulnerable, torn between what he wants and his responsibility that comes with his great power. Seeing his anguish at his inability to help his Aunt May keep up mortgage payments on her house as well has not being able to tell her that he was indirectly responsible for his uncle being murdered. When you see Mary Jane waiting in vain for Peter's love and commitment or seeing Harry Osborn obsessing over Spider-Man, seething at the thought of his best friend protecting the man he thinks murdered his father. Even Doc Oc's struggle with his own sanity and the blurring of right and wrong in his ever maddening mind. The entire cast give there characters real depth and believability that is a credit to them and again Sam Raimi for trying to emphasize the need for strong believable characters as well as stomach churning, edge of your seat action sequences. Again Tobey Maguire fits easily in to the Spidey suit (although it does ride up in the crotch sometimes) and gives a superb performance as our torn hero. James Franco is excellent as the brooding Harry Osborn & Kirsten Dunst is, well, Mary Jane. Alfred Molina is clearly having a whale of a time as Doc Oc, showing he more than just a cartoon style villain like the Willem Defoe's Green Goblin. He actually creates a villain that you can feel for. And lets not forget the wonderful J.K.Simmons. He provides the comic relief with gusto relish. Chewing up and spitting out scenery and cigars in equal measure. If I had to pick a fault, it would be the limited screen time of J.K.Simmons, who is one of the most watchable character actors around at the minute. But that is just a minor gripe. Spider-Man 2 is a triumph from start to finish. A rare breed of film that actually surpasses it's predecessor in every way. Not many films can say that, X2, The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather 2 being the only ones that really spring to my mind. Sam Raimi has truly raised the standard that all films, not just summer blockbusters, have to try to match. It's not just the greatest comic book Superhero film ever made, its one of the best films of the last 20 years, ranking along side The Lord of the Rings trilogy for sheer cinematic pleasure. Mr Raimi you are a genius. I'm just disappointed that I have to wait 3 years for the third installment of this marvelous roller-coaster ride.",10,0,0,16 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," All my expectations fulfilled.
","Let's start by saying I am a massive fan of the book Lord of the Rings. I have been for around 25 years. Bare in mind that I'm only 32, and you realize that I have been a fan most of my life. In that time I have often thought about a live action version of this classic. Who could make it, who could play the central characters, would it be three films or one big one. In more recent times I would discuss this with my wife who is also an avid fan. So imagine my surprise when about 6 years ago I read that Kiwi Peter Jackson was to direct a live action version (the cartoons is sh**)of my fave story. The same Peter Jackson who gave us Braindead & Bad Taste (oh my God).That said The Frighteners was immensely enjoyable & Heavenly Creatures is a beautifully made film, I was still filled with chagrin. Where was Ridley Scott, Steven Speilberg or even Martin Scorsese (can you imagine Harvey Keitel has Gandalf, Robert De Niro as Saruman & Joe Pesci as Bilbo Baggins? 'Gimme back my f**king ring motherf**ker') Well, thankfully I was wrong. Mr Peter Jackson (oh praise him) has come up with, in my eyes, a masterpiece. He has managed to create a movie that is not only visually spectacular but is more importantly character driven. It is everything I had imagined it should be & more. The casting by Mr Jackson, Fran Walsh & Phillipa Boyens is almost spot on. I say almost because I still expect Hugo Weaving (Elrond) to say ' Ah Mr Anderson' (You know, from the less impressive trilogy of modern cinema. But I am now accustomed to him after numerous viewings. Sean Bean is magnificent as Boromir, but is not given nearly enough screen time. The same can be said of that behemoth of horror Christopher Lee. The rest of the cast also do a cracking job in there roles, in particular, Sean Astin as Sam Gamgee, Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins (could it have been anyone else?) & the imperious Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey, who just about steals every scene he's in. A special mention must go the casting of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn/Strider. He was virtually unknown when cast yet I can't imagine anyone else filling those mighty boots.The films pace is just about perfect, hurtling from one set piece to another, yet never letting the story or characters get lost in over elaborate special effects. The script is fairly tight & doesn't get caught up in some of Professor Tolkein's flowery speech & posturing. And thankfully all those songs in the book, one of 2 real criticism's of the novel, are absent. The other criticism that has been addressed (sort of) is the fleshing out of the female character's in the book. Prof Tolkein couldn't really write women so Mr J, Ms W & Ms B had to give them more meat to their frail bones. After all a film with no women couldn't really work, could it? The character of Arwen is still pretty flimsy though.The special effects are, well, special. In fact they are so good that you don't really notice them until you watch the film a few times. Even then you still say to yourself 'how did they do that?'. Simple things like the Hobbits standing next to Men to the more complex and magnificent flight through the Mines of Moria are all done with an expertise & flare never seen before.The music score is wonderfully crafted by Howard Shore. The man clearly knows how to tell a story through the medium of music, knowing when to be subtle & when to get right in your face with big, brash, boisterous blasts of sound that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.This is a film that can appeal to everyone from the smallest child to the oldest fogie. It will make you cry, laugh, jump, shudder & cheer in equal measure.I would implore everyone to see this masterpiece as it deserve's to be seen by everyone. Thank you Mr Jackson & bless you. You have fulfilled all of my expectations and more.",10,0,1,26 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The best so far.
","Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is a curious movie. It is probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, being a bit more sinister & gothic in both the look & content. It has, on the whole, better performances from the cast than the other movies. It doesn't seem to drag like the first 2 did in places. And the special effects are dazzling. Yet, as I pondered the movie a couple of hours after I had seen it. I found myself thinking `Yes it was probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, but what was missing' Well I eventually realised what was missing after watching the HP & the Chamber of Secrets' with my kids later that evening. I shall come to the missing ingredient a little later. It's Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts School of Wichcraft & Wizardry, & yet again he is caught up in mysterious goings on. The mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard's prison `Azkaban' & is making a B-line for Hogwarts & in particular, it seems, Harry himself. It transpires that Sirius Black was the wizard responsible for the Death of Harry's parents, at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. As a result, the guards of Azkaban, or Dementors (think floaty Ringwraiths), have been stationed at Hogwarts to try to stop him. They do seem more intent on trying to suck the soul out of our hero. (That's what a Dementor does to its victim. It sucks all of the goodness out them until they are nothing but a living shell of a human). Add to this a Werewolf, a Hippogriff (a half horse, half eagle that can fly) & a menacing black dog that seems to be stalking Harry, & you have movie choc full of mystery & marvel. Now to the positives & negatives. Alfonso Cuaron has managed to get the best out of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). He seems to be more at ease in front of a camera, when delivering his dialogue & you get the feeling that he has actually been given the proper encouragement & coaching. He seems to be a far more confident actor than the wooden puppet of the previous films. The other child actors are also very good, with both Emma Watson & Rupert Grint (Hermione Grainger & Ron Weasley) showing that they could have big careers ahead of them. In fact, the cast as a whole are pretty damn good. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane & Dame Maggie Smith all slide comfortably back in to their usual rolls & are, as usual, excellent. The new members of the cast are also very good, with David Thewlis excellent as Professor Lupin and the magnificent Gary Oldman (chewing up & spitting out every scene he is in, with relish) as the sinister Sirius Black. The actor with the hardest job out of the whole cast was Sir Michael Gambon. He had the unenviable task of replacing the late Sir Richard Harris. Thankfully he slips in to Dumbledore's robes with the minimum of fuss, playing it more as a bumbling old hippy rather than the imperious & imposing Harris' Dumbledore.The only real disappointment in the cast is Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney. She over compensates for limited screen time, with over the top, hammy nonsense. The visual effects, as you might expect, are top notch. Cuaron seems to have taken a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book, letting the visual effects fit around the movie rather than the George Lucas style of let the visual effects be the movie. The pacing of the film is just about spot on as well. It's not too long & it manages to stick to the book fairly well (although the lack of explanation about the origins of the Marauders Map was fairly irritating).But. There were a few minus points as well as that missing thing I mentioned earlier. Again, as with the first two movies, Alan Rickman is woefully under-used as the bitter & twisted Prof. Snape & the same goes for the glorious Gary Oldman & his movie stealing performance. And the biggest thing to be missing was a standout action set-piece.In both previous movies, there have been major spectacular set pieces that have really stuck in my mind. In the first one (The Philosophers Stone) there was Harry's first Quidditch match & the Giant Chess match. In the second (The Chamber of Secrets) there was the flight to Hogwarts in the Weasley's Ford Anglia, another impressive Quidditch match, the escape from Aragog's lair (Aragog is a giant spider) & the battle with the giant Basilisk (Snake). Yet in Azkaban, there is nothing that stands out (apart from performances which some would say isn't a bad thing). Harry Potter films need a good set piece or two. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good action sequences. The journey by Knightbus, Quidditch in a thunderstorm, a Hippogriff flight sequence & a werewolf/dog fight. It's just that you get the feeling that you've seen similar before, so there is no real wow factor.On the whole this is a mightily impressive movie. Alfonso Cuaron delivered a movie as magical as the first two movies but with more depth & much better performances by the impressive cast.",8,0,1,8 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," oh my god
","`I hope this is as good as the Fellowship'. That was my initial thought when I sat down to watch The Two Towers' at the cinema on the 18th December 2002. Thankfully this lived up to my expectations as much as the first movie did. Mr Jackson, like the plot, had continued where he had left off in Fellowship'. The Two Towers looks & feels perfect. The pace is quick, but never rushed, the acting is excellent & is never allowed to become to camp or hammy' & it all looks beautiful, thanks to the use of New Zealand as Middle Earth & some of the greatest visual effects ever seen on celluloid. The plot continues where the first film left us. Frodo & Sam (Elijah Wood & Sean Astin) have gone off alone to Mordor to try to destroy the Ring & Aragorn, Gimli & Legolas (Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys Davies & Orlando Bloom) have decided to pursue the Uruk Hai who have captured Merry & Pippin (Dominic Monoghan & Billy Boyd) & are taking them to see good wizard gone bad Saruman (Christopher Lee). Along the way we are introduced to more characters, some good, King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) his niece Eowen (Miranda Otto) & her brother Eomer (Karl Urban) & Faramir of Gondor (David Wenham) who is the brother the now dead Boromir. We also meet the scheming Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) & Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis). We also meet new fantastical creatures such as Ents (giant walking trees) & fell beasts (flying lizards that the Nazgul now ride). The film has a plethora of wonderful set-pieces that take your breath away. There are the wonderfully imagined Ents, 2 fantastic skirmishes between Riders of Rohan & Orcs, one of which involved large wolf like creatures called Wargs. Then there is the battle at Helm's Deep (The fortress stronghold of the people of Gondor). This has to rank as one of the greatest battles ever seen on film. It truly does take your breath away when you see an army of 10,000 Orcs marching towards a fortress built into a mountain, manned by only 300 soldiers & 150 Elves. The battle scenes are intense, violent & fairly graphic, but thankfully the violence is never gratuitous.But all of that is almost forgotten in comparison to the single greatest special effect ever to grace the silver screen. Gollum. Actually, to call Gollum a special effect is being unfair to Andy Serkis. Because, although what you see on screen is a computer generated image, Gollum is brought to life by the magnificent Serkis. His voice, movement & performance are what brought the best out of WETA when they were designing Gollum & without him they wouldn't have created this phenomenon. And this creation is so good that you forget the he is CGI. Not only this, he steals every scene he is in, whether he is the Gollum seen in the opening attack on Frodo & Sam to the cowering, snivelling subservient wretch that is Smeagol. He also provides the highlight of the film. When the personalities of Gollum & Smeagol come head to head in a moonlight confrontation, it is like being hit in the heart with a 500lb emotional sledge hammer. This is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone on the planet. My only gripe is that the magnificent Andy Serkis wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his powerhouse performance. See this film, I implore you all.",10,0,0,23 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Wecome back QT
","Ever since the disappointing 'Jackie Brown' in 1997, film fans have been wandering 'what ever happened to that Tarantino fella that every young new movie Director tried to imitate?' Well the answer is that he was writing (along with the lovely Uma Thurman) his story of 'bloody revenge' that is known as Kill Bill Vol 1. The basic plot is that a character known only as the Bride is left for dead in a Texas chapel on her wedding, day along with 8 other unfortunates. It also transpires that she is pregnant with the would be killer's child (the Bill of the title). 4 years later she wakes up in a hospital bed, & then goes on a violent, bloody & at times hilarious revenge rampage. That's it in a nut shell & the result's are absolutely magnificent. From the opening cat fight with Vernita Green (Vivacia Fox) to the incredible (& I mean INCREDIBLE) showdown with the Crazy 88, the film's pace is relentless. It thunders from set piece to set piece wreaking havoc on the senses. But be warned, the film is not for those of a weak constitution. It contains some of the most outrageous, bloody & over the top violence ever put on to celluloid. But that is where QT's wicked sense of fun comes to the fore. The Violence is so gloriously gory & OTT that you can't help but laugh at it's absurdity. There is also a beautiful crafted & imagined flashback sequence done in animated Manga style that is possibly the highlight of this near masterpiece. I say near masterpiece because there are a couple of minor grievances I have with this movie. The characters all seem a little 1 dimensional, in fact they are almost cartoon like, so you don't really care about any of them a great deal. Also there isn't any of the usual Tarantino snappy dialogue that you almost take for granted with the great man. There is also the 'I'm sure I've seen this before somewhere' feeling you get whilst watching this movie. If you are a fan of old Samurai or Kung Foo films you will recognise alot of nods to some of the Eastern classics (Bruce Lee's yellow jump suit in Game of Death being an obvious one). Those small gripes aside, Old Banana Chin has come up with the goods once again. & you can forget about all the CGI nonsense that was so obvious in the Matrix Reloaded, What you see on screen in Kill Bill is a masterclass in choreography, timing & gushing blood fountains. Magnificent. Buy it.",9,0,2,5 May 2004
