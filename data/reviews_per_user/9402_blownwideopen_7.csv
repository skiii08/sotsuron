Blade Runner 2049," Better than I expected
","I have come not to expect much from any reboots or remakes or re-imaginings these days. It always seems to come down to a total lack of new ideas which results in horrible, lazy writing & terrible scripts. I see that a lot of reviewers here have bashed this movie for the above mentioned reasons. But, for me it came down to the visuals. One of the reasons the original Blade Runner was so astonishing was due to the stunning & ground breaking visuals. So, even though the overall story & feel of Blade Runner 2049 fell short, the visuals totally transported me back in time to the original vibe. A fine homage in my opinion!",7,0,1,20 June 2018
It," Nowhere near as good as the 1990 TV movie & it wasn't great, just ok!
","Bad script, poor character development, terrible editing, completely miscast & totally not scary. My rating of 3 is probably too generous. But, if I post a lower rating then IMDb will just counteract it with a fake 10 star rating. It's so sad that Hollywood can no longer make a decent movie & even more disturbing that they've obviously bought out or paid off every critic and movie review site!",3,6,9,19 January 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Wow ... what a horrible let down!
","After all the hype & stellar reviews, what a terrible disappointment! Since when is Thor a frigging comedy? Obviously all the jokes are a feeble attempt to cover up piss poor writing. It's going on a decade now of brutal writing, poor story telling, & bad scripts. Joke was on me for being bamboozled into wasting 2 hours of my life on this nonsense!",2,8,16,21 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," How is this possibly at 8.6?
",Let's see ... we can't write a decent story or come up with anything original any more. So let's just throw every character ever conceived of into a giant mashup & that'll make a great movie! Right? WRONG!!,4,33,50,19 August 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Ruined by the San Diego sequence
",Honestly this could have been a great movie but in my mind I've always hated it. Recently rewatched it & realized why. The final sequence with the T-Rex running around San Diego is just ridiculous. Like a really cheesy Godzilla or low budget King Kong style movie. Brought the entire movie down. This is unfortunate since the first 3/4 of the movie is actually great with fantastic action sequences & amazing effects and CGI. Then they had to go and ruin it.,6,1,2,5 April 2020
Coyote Ugly," Not what I expected
","I actually did not bother to see this movie until months after the video came out. My loss! A friend recommended the movie, so I rented it and was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be just another 'sexy' but pointless movie (which is still perfectly fine by me). However, it was a charming and humorous story that I quite enjoyed! Oh, and where did this Piper Perabo girl appear from suddenly?? She is an absolute doll!!",8,0,1,24 June 2001
It Chapter Two," Had super low expectations but was still disappointed!
","I rated the first part of It a 3 stars & that was generous. No more generosity! Bad writing, bad dialogue, bad casting, bad acting, bad CGI. Hoped they would do a better job on Chapter 2. Sadly I shouldn't have allowed myself any expectations. Poor Stephen King is trapped in one of his own horror novels. Where every amazing story he has ever written is utterly screwed up by ridiculous Hollywood fools!",1,1,3,27 April 2020
