The Blair Witch Project," Intense and original!
","A group of friends and I attended 'The Blair Witch Project' midnight on a Saturday.  We were not so much ready to be scared as we were ready to be entertained.  Alas, we received more than we bargained for! With a list of summer movies that can be defined as 'Jaws' with an alligator, 'Jaws' with a smarter shark, and 'Jaws' with a possessed house, it was simply amazing to see such an original idea from a group of lesser know performers. The best part about 'Blair Witch' is the fact that the ending and conclusion are left completely to the audiences imagination. As we drove back home to our houses (conveniently found in the woods)we tried to scare the wits out of one another discussing the truly disturbing ending.  In the end I would like to thank the actors, whose incredibly realistic performance, left me terrified to fall asleep in my bed at 4:00 am.  This is a movie not to be missed!!!!",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
