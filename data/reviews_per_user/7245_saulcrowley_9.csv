Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Uma kills bill
","What to say about kill bill volume 2? Is it boring? no, is it funny? yes, is it as brilliant as i had expected it to be? of course it was. Kill bill vol 2 is a breathtaking, Kung Fu epic that deserves the fullest attention. Its true that it doesn't have much blood in it; but don't let that stop you! The fight between Elle driver and The Bride was defiantly the highlight of the movie, as the fight with O-Ren in the first film is gorgeous to look at, this fight is gruesome and gory. Quentin Tarantino has made the best film of 2004. When it came to Bill vs Uma i was expecting a Neo vs agent smith fight from The Matrix Revolutions but in instead what came was a great way for an evil man of that standard to die from. The cast was brilliant especially Bill and Budd Tarantino's greatest characters. I could go on about how great this film is, instead i will say my final words: Kill Bill is a fitting climax to one of the best action films of recent years. Go see it and have a blast. 10/10 Saul",Null,0,1,3 May 2004
Se7en," A great thriller
","Seven is an amazing and gory police/criminal thriller with lots of gory moments and great performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. This is David Fincher's best film, it is dark, scary, grim and gives a new meaning to the word 'rain'. It is hard to write a review about this film. Warning: this is not easy viewing. The ending is one of the best i've ever seen and a great twist. As we travel with the detectives to each murder we no that he is not joking and it won't end pretty. I won't let to much information out about this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.",Null,0,0,28 December 2003
Armageddon," A MUST SEE MOVIE, GREAT CAST, GREAT EFFECTS, GREAT PRODUCER!
","I watched this film the other day, and how great it is. The action is spot on, the cast is great, the producer is a movie legend and the emotions run high. This movie is a 1000 times better than Pearl Harbour. The best action scene has got to be the meteor shower. This has got to be one of the best summer blockbusters. It makes Deep impact look like a brownies meeting! Bruce Willis is back on top, but gives the sweaty t-shirt to ben afleck. The story is simple. a meteor the size of texas is heading to earth and a bunch of oil drillers are sent to drill into the centre of this meteor and plant a bomb inside and blow it up. if you like big, dumb but awesome action movies check this out! Lets hope bad boys 2 is as good as this!",Null,1,2,28 July 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A stomach churning, action packed romp
","When i first heard that Quentin Tarantino was doing a revenge film, i couldn't wait. Kill Bill is an amazing action/kung fu film. This has all the hallmarks of a Tarantino flick, the music, the dialogue and again he shows that he can be the most talented film maker in Hollywood today. It starts with a brilliant opening sequence and ends with a breathtaking final battle. In my opinion best action film of 2003. It starts with slow burning story telling and then moves to the films climatic and brilliant action sequence remember these words 'tricks are for kids' If tarantino had given this to a different director they would probably of made a brainless piece of summer crap, The Bride is totally believable as a killer. If you love blood, samurai swords or Quentin Tarantino check this out, i strongly recommend it. Roll on Kill Bill volume 2!",Null,0,1,22 March 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," A trip through space and time which we are all invited on
","Lets face it 2001: A Space Odyssey is the best science fiction film ever and the backbone of the science fiction genre, without it Star Wars, Starship Troopers and solaris couldn't of been filmed. Kubrick new exactly how he wanted it to be filmed. It holds enough dialogue to partly understand the film. From the unforgettable Dawn of Man sequence to the final unimaginable climax, 2001 holds you tight and never lets you go. The most impressive visual in the entire film is the Star Gate sequence, all the colours of the rainbow are thrown at the screen as we sit and drool at how wonderful it is, kubrick created the 'Stargate' sequence to give stoners the 'ultimate thrill ride'. At times it can be haunting and chill you to the bone. Kubrick gives us the nightmare computer Hal 9000 and steals the film. It has the best monkey make-up this side of Planet of the Apes. I have never saw classical music put to brilliant use on film here the director plays with different types of music from The Blue Danube Waltz to Strauss. To the original viewer this is a slow burning, masterpiece but the other viewer will class this as 'film crap' Some reasons why the other class of viewer may not like this is because there is hardly any dialogue in it and not much happens news flash to you; all films don't have to be bang bang boom boom to be enjoyed. If you want a slow burning, mind numbing film experience and a work of art, check this out. Rest in peace Kubrick.",Null,0,2,6 April 2004
Pulp Fiction," If you like Quentin Tarantino, Sam L Jackson, John Travolta or Bruce Willis watch the film!
","I first saw this film when i was fourteen and i am now fifteen and it still has the same impact as it did one year ago. The acting is spot on, the humor is hilarious, the dialoge is fantastic and music is great. The best scene in the whole film is when Jules and Vincent arrive in a apartment asking three men questions Jules tuens to one man and says 'Say what again i dare ya, i double dare ya mother******, say what one more god damn time!' The way QT works is amazing. The ending is still breathtaking. Defiantly QTs finest hour. i could right about this film all day, but i wont. Lets hope Kill Bill is as great as this. 10/10 *****",Null,0,1,8 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Great!
","I went to watch this film in the cinema. i LOVED IT! The special effects are mind - bending, the action is breathtaking and that car chase, one word for that WOW it was amazing. i must go and watch the third matrix movie. Although some of the acting was a bit weak, but not much. The twins are SOO cool, and so is Agent Smith. This is a great film, but not as good as the original. Watch the first movie before watching this movie, it will make more sense. If you like big action, great special effects and a historical car chase, check this film out NOW! 4 stars out of 5.",Null,0,0,10 November 2003
True Romance," Great!
","True Romance is a great crime movie. The performances are rock solid, especially Gary Oldman as the pimp. The cameo's are impressive too including Brad Pitt as the stoner, Chris Walker as part of the mafia and lots lots more. What also makes this film intreseting is that it was scripted by Quentin Tarantino. If you enjoyed Pulp Fiction or Natural Born Killers check this out! 5/5.",Null,1,4,14 November 2003
Donnie Darko," A great, refreshing and original film.
","Its hard to write a review about Donnie Darko because there are to many great issues about it: sanity/insanity, happiness/loneliness and the most important one life/death. Some reasons why i like this film: 1) It treats the audience with respect. 2) It makes us think. 3) Its not an all out, guns blazing end of the world disaster film. 4) It is a very cleaver teenage film.For the normal viewer its another drama film, but for the other viewer it travels deep into all the characters minds especially Donnie; is he really insane? is the world really going to end? is the bunny rabbit his only friend? At times this is disturbing viewing: Donnie has visions, sleepwalks and becomes obsessed with time travel. Patrick Swayze is also good as a high powered speaker. This film asks a lot of questions but the most important: Can we control our own fate? After viewing this picture questions will be asked!",Null,0,1,21 December 2003
