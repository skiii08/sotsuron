The New World," Love.
","A full on romantic epic, a take on the loves of Pocahontas. Brilliant, full of perfect cinematography and symbolism. Sadness, tragedy, loss, birth, re-ignition of life, nobility, intelligence.The violence is completely non-graphic, and would have distracted from the romantic through lines if it were present. Music and sound design has been crafted well.Tear jerking and bold stuff, ultimately satisfying.",10,1,1,10 August 2019
Argo," Strong stuff.
","I really hope that no one has suffered Cardiac Arrest while watching this film. My Heart goes out to those with a weak Heart! My Goodness, a film has not put me on the edge of my seat like this for a long time. Hats off to the team for producing this work. All the tools of film making have been effectively wielded in a cohesive manner to to produce this effective time based art-form. The music and editing are notable, but to single out any one department here is not fair. The hair styles, the fact that smoking was no so demonized back then, and the strong recreation of the political backdrop to the events, are examples of other aspects that contributed to the effectiveness of this story told. But seriously, if you have Heart problems... please make sure you have a relaxant on hand while watching this :)",10,1,4,10 March 2013
The Great Dictator," The Best.
","Absolutely brilliant satire! We laughed until we were upside down in parts of the film. The comic genius of the film maker shines here. Strong humor, justified attacks at the fascists, belittling Hitler and friends, incredible scenes, appropriate commentary on war and peace, beautiful humanity, anti-establishment. If anyone does not 'get' something positive from this film they were either were not concentrating or they must see the world through miserable eyes indeed.One of the funniest things you will ever witness. It moves slowly in places but its nice to see something with such a wild narrative structure as this, like a car going fast then slow then fast then faster then slow then fast...etc. Many 'hollywood' blockbusters have much more irritating slow romantic interludes than this does.Do your self a favor, grab a copy of this, sit back preferably with a good friend or two whom you enjoy a laugh with, and you will have chest pains from the bellowing!!",10,1,2,30 October 2010
Cold Mountain," Bitter-sweet drama.
","Starts of a bit hokey but develops into a hard core drama. When a film grows like this it reflects the human experience of learning and life unfolding. Sometimes we don't grow, sometimes we do. Here they do quite a lot. Impressive encapsulation of the process of life. Only annoying thing was the preponderance of Hollywood stars featuring as the timeline progresses. Yes they do a good job but the familiarity was slightly distracting. However by the end the pure emotional clout overrides this distraction. Well made piece.",9,1,2,28 August 2018
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Love this work.
","Brilliant, justified, impressive, fast paced, awesome music, heartfelt, surprising, raises the bar, well directed, well edited, incredible CGI, top sound design, realistic sets, expansive scope, deserving end for the human race, faultlessly realized intelligence, all apes cast well as ensemble, makes one happy that Hollywood is still able to bring out stronger material amongst the crap, perfect cinematography, cohesive grade, connect to the main character, amazing flying camera shots, totally impressive development of character, wanted more, proud of the apes, CGI character facial expressions are out of this world, almost solid logic, did not hurt my ears, exciting, satisfying, entertaining, thought provoking, mesmerizing film.",10,16,28,8 August 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A fine ride.
","An engaging journey packed with 60's Hollywood, music and TV culture pathos, presented via the hypercritical perspective of those that were there in the middle of it at the time. Brilliantly created film in all departments, from the fine details to the overall pacing, this is team film-making at its unified best.Apart from a few moments of very nasty violence, this is a masterpiece.
Well done Tarantino and team. The direction, casting, acting, production design, costumes, grade, musical aspects, sound design, script and more - are all outstanding.Thanks for the experience !",9,1,3,27 March 2020
Arrival," Fresh and mind bending.
","Being interested in genuine searching for ET life, this is something very welcome.
A thoughtful depiction of developed aliens with an appropriate multidimensional twist. Beings that experience time in a very different way to us, coming out of their safe zone to interact and the worlds response to it. I feel things would not play out in reality as they did in this film, but this is the closest scenario as to what would actually happen that I've seen recently. Good contribution to the alien mythology.",10,3,5,7 June 2018
