Skyfall," Worst James Bond Movie Ever!
","I have seen every movie ever put out about James Bond and the worst used to be the '90's man' sensitive James Bond movies with Timothy Dalton. It was not his fault, but the whole premise of changing James Bond's character and Pierce Brosnan should be thankful that he could not be in those ones.Now however James Bond has jumped the shark! Both Ian Flemming and Cubby Broccoli are rolling over in their graves with the travesty that this movie is. I really feel sorry for Adele having to sing the title song to this piece of absolute garbage.My kids and I hated this movie for the following reasons. 1) James Bond with no gadgets is not James Bond. Bringing back a old spy car was the only thing that sort of differentiated him from any other spy or thriller movie. This was like they killed the whole series right there.2) Moneypenny changes from an older white lady to a young black lady with no explanation? Is she a daughter or what the heck is the back story. Totally confusing and unnecessary.3) No real Q which goes with #1. What the hell were they thinking?! It is a staple of the franchise, when Bond monkeys around with the gadgets and makes Q want to pull out his hair.4) Killing off M kind of sucked, but we could have accepted it, if not for the previous 3 points.There is so much more that was dumb about this movie that I will not waste my time anymore on it, but I will say that my children, the future movie goers that you want to entice, will never want to see any newer James Bond Movies.Way to kill a successful franchise!",1,5,12,18 December 2013
