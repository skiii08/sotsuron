The Blair Witch Project," Excellent Stuff!
","I couldn´t wait to see this movie. Friends in Holland or Spain saw it before me, because it was released later in Germany. Everybody told me: very scary! Unfortunately I knew, before I saw the movie that the whole story was not authentic. Well I was scared, but I think if you go and watch the movie without knowing anything besides the storyline (Three student film makers... ...their footage was found) it´s going to be even better. Anyway, go and see this movie. It´s excellent stuff. It´s a completely new idea of film making. Good Job Sanchez and Myrick!",9,0,0,13 December 1999
The English Patient," Good movie, but overrated!
","The English Patient is a well done movie. A movie about love, war and history. But as I read in many reviews: 'Simple story brilliantly told', I don´t think that´s true. The main credit deserves to Michael Ondaatje, the author of the novel 'The English Patient'. Because it´s the story that fascinated me, not the screenplay or the acting. Go and see this movie. It´s a good one, but overrated. 7 out of 10!",7,0,2,2 January 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Good, but it`s not reaching Matrix/Fight Club on the scale
","Another chapter in the new Hollywood movies generation was written by John Woo: Mission Impossible II. Good movie. 7 out of 10. But the film is not reaching the levels of Matrix and Fight Club, movies that still set the standards in  HSHM (High Speed Hollywood Movies). Go and see it anyway, it´s good fun!!",7,0,0,9 July 2000
