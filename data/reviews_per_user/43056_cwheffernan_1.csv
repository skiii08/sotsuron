The Benchwarmers," $33,000,000 budget for this disaster?
","This is quite possibly the worst movie I have never watched. I caught a few minutes of it on TV and realized I had more important things to do with my life. That's why I'm writing this short but informative review. The only thing you need to know about this movie is that Rob Scneider has never been funny. David Spade hasn't been funny since Chris Farley died. Jon Heder is Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon Dynamite sucks. Don't watch this movie if you like baseball. Don't watch this movie if you like comedy. Don't watch this movie if you like yourself. Do watch this movie if your the densest person that you know. Do watch this movie if you need a lethal dose of the worst, made for comedy soundtrack that pop-punk has to offer. Seriously though watch it. Psych. Don't.",Null,0,0,7 April 2012
