The Blair Witch Project," I don't like people slagging the best parts!
","~~***SPOILERS***~~OK, chances are, if you're reading this, the 339th comment on BWP, you don't need to hear about all that's already been said in the other comments. I want to discuss what people are beating it up for.--The Final ShotThe last shot in the movie is the scariest image I have ever scene (next to Paula Jones holding that Check. Eek!). I read a comment in this list describing the last shot as: 'dead guy in corner.' Mike, back to camera in near darkness, is not dead for this last shot. As the legend has it, The Blair Witch, when presented with multiple victims, killed one and made the others stand in the corner because she didn't like feeling their eyes on her. Mike wasn't dead. He was under her control... or something... I don't know exactly ... waiting to be killed next. --'It sucked! You never even see her!'Or so a friend of mine said after the movie. Now, this is the scariest part of the film: You don't see her. You see very little. Hints of her existence: stick men, handprints (Egads!), etc. The closest we come is in the end when we hear Heather get hit... or something (again, we don't know for sure) ... and the camera falls to the ground and the credits roll.The film is basically a POV experience. We ARE Heather for that part. We are looking through her eyes. We are just as scared because...she didn't ever see the witch either! We see Mike...what's going on? ...There's something behind! -click- That's it. So what happened? You should think about it tonight in bed... in the dark.--'They wouldn't have kept the cameras running.'This is simple. We see early on that Heather is obsessive about her film. She wants to document it all. She even writes so in her journal (which can be read at www.blairwitch.com). She partially was leaving the tapes behind as clues in case they didn't make it back. ('If we die out here, at least the cops will see what happened when they find our bones.')--VulgarityIf YOU were in their situation, YOU would be cursing and screaming like a banshee, too. --Jerky camera movementsWell, throwing up certainly adds to the realism of the experience, doesn't it? In conclusion, I have to say the The Blair Witch Project is the scariest movie I've ever seen. I still, four days after seeing it, sleep with the lights on. Maybe I just have a hyperactive imagination...? Whatever, I'm just frightened.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I am flabbergasted in more ways than one.
","Okay, first off, I loved The Phantom Menace. The action was suspenseful, the lightsaber duels were fantastic, the acting was almost all OK...Here's what I don't like about it: Star Wars fans are criticizing it! Everyone seems to have forgotten what Star Wars is all about: Good fun, excitement, and corny dialogue. As the credits rolled, I was near tears because I was so moved by the power of actually having just seen a Star Wars movie on the big screen for the very first time, and I turned to my friends and found them all dissing it! 'Under developed characters!' 'Annoying Jar Jar Binks!' 'Childish humor!' Well, honestly, Threepio is as foolish as Jar Jar. The Ewoks were far worse than The Gungans... every fault that Episode One has can also be found in the original Trilogy. The only thing I kinda agree with is that Darth Maul should've had more screen time. He was great, and I would've liked to see more of him. However, his lack of lines made those scenes were he did appear all the more powerful. It was a surprise when he showed up, and this element really worked.Anyway, I wish people would stop looking for the wrong, which is exactly what's happening. It Star Wars -- have some fun!",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
Life Is Beautiful," How perfectly dazzling...
","There's nothing bad to say about this movie. Easily the best film of 98, it moves and amazes. I can't describe how powerful it is. Some tore it up for trivializing the Holocaust, as did a review in The New Yorker, but it really doesn't. The scenes at the concentration camp don't make fun of it, they just put some hope in. I truly urge all of you who seen this film to do so.",Null,1,2,27 April 1999
The Matrix," This movie is too popular, and too cool.
","Everyone seems to love this movie. I don't get why. There are gaping plot holes, horrible acting and dialogue, and it rips off Star Wars in the whole manipulation of the Matrix/Force. It was very cool, and entertaining if you don't think about it too much, but really that's all that can be said for it.",Null,0,0,27 April 1999
