United 93," Grim but useful reminder of an awful day
","United 93 definitely brings back the emotions of 9/11--possibly even more so because at the time there was so much confusion that no one could be sure what was happening. Now that I know what happened, and even though there's no real suspense in the movie, my stomach was tied in knots for almost two hours. The confusion of the day, for almost everyone involved, comes through clearly. There is an implied--and often explicit--criticism of the government response to the day's events, particularly the FAA and the military, as if they should have been immune to the confusion surrounding such an unprecedented attack. Don't get me wrong--this is no Michael Moore type slander, and probably most of the criticism is deserved. But I can't help but remember watching John Ford's 'Battle of Midway', filmed in June 1942 during the darkest days of World War II. I was probably 11 years old in about 1960 when I saw it, and I still remember the pride I felt in our Marines as they defended that tiny island, even though they ultimately were overwhelmed. Lots of mistakes were made then, too, but we had a war to win; it was not a time for pointing fingers. Maybe United 93 would have been as inspiring, if John Ford had made it. As it is, the movie is a grim, but useful, reminder of an awful day. I just wish it had been more than that.",7,1,4,2 May 2006
Alexander," Awful. Just awful.
","Every time I see an Oliver Stone movie I remember why I promised myself the last time that I'd never see another one. This time it's guaranteed; I'd have to be suffering from Alzheimer's to break that promise again.The confusion starts with the opening scene: Someone is lying on a bed, dying, and a large ring falls from his (her?) hand. Somehow I got the idea it was Alexander's mother dying in childbirth, but then the scene jumps forward 40 years, to Anthony Hopkins as he describes Alexander's campaigns to a scribe. We don't discover until the end of the film that the opening scene was of Alexander's death. A little while later Alexander has a fight with his father the king, and then suddenly we see King Alexander leading 40,000 into battle. How his father died is not mentioned until a scene that explains it is suddenly just inserted--again, for no apparent reason, near the end of the film. Not that it mattered; by that time I was so thoroughly disgusted with the sequencing and the girly men and the gratuitous homosexuality and red filtered battle scenes and silly snake symbolism that I could have cared less.My wife was ready to leave about half way through this ridiculously long, self-indulgent mess. One of these days I'm going to wise up and start listening to her. Do yourself a favor and learn from my mistake.",1,0,1,27 November 2004
August Rush," Music to my ears...and eyes
","Okay, I'll grant that August Rush is derivative--the plot resembles Oliver Twist (the Dickens characters Fagin and the Artful Dodger are easy to pick out), and its tear-jerking finish is entirely predictable. Perhaps because it wasn't marketed as fantasy, some critics went in expecting to see a drama about an orphan genius in search of his parents. What they got was a long chain of fairy tale coincidences that makes Enchanted seem logical. No, it's not perfect. Keri Russel--the wonderful star of 'Waitress'--is beautiful as the boy's mother, but a little too compliant to her domineering father. Freddie Highmore is almost too cute (but still you have to love him). Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a good singer, but not great. But who cares? The whole point of August Rush is to celebrate imagination and communicate to the audience a passionate love of music. I can only pity those who don't love this movie. Sadly, they just can't hear the music.",8,1,3,29 November 2007
300," Synopsis: Freedom isn't free
","First surprise: My wife talked me into seeing '300'. I really couldn't understand why she was so interested in a gory comic book version of one of history's great battles. Our 17-year-old son even tried to talk her out of it. Second surprise: We actually enjoyed the movie! Yes, it's extremely violent, but after Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypto, Pan's Labytinth, and the evening news I suppose we're getting used to such things. And the look of the film is just detached enough from reality that its shock value is somewhat reduced. And boy is it gorgeous! I love stories of courage and honor, and this one has it in spades. Plus it doesn't pull any punches. The timing of its release--just as the Democratic Congress is trying to force trough a 'non-binding' resolution to cut-and-run from Iraq--just can't be a coincidence. As for the corrupt Spartan politician who stopped reinforcements from reaching Leonidas, I wonder which political party he would belong to if he were alive today.",8,2,7,16 March 2007
