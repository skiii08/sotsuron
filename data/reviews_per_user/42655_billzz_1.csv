Mission: Impossible III," I really like this movie. It is awesome!!
","Movie Mission Impossible had three level. No.1 is about a man who betray Tom Cruise. No.2 is about a bad guy who invented a poison that can make people died very soon. No.3, the best movie of those three, is about a bad guy who gang up with a person in IMF sell weapons to the bad organizations. Tom Cruise is going to disclose the bad guy. It is a great action movie that I had never seen. this movie is directed by J.J.Abrams who directed lost, too.I think he is a genius that he always had great, interested, and new ideas. Tom Cruise is a genius in acting. He can do almost everything in the movie. the other characters are also fun, too. they show high skills and good acting. i think thats why i really like it. i think up of these, it can take 9. And about the last 1 point i think us because the story is very excited and spectacular.",10,0,1,13 June 2007
