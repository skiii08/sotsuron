The Ring," Effective thriller with holes
","SPOILER************************** OK, if you had a tape that when viewed kills the viewer, wouldn't you do a better job of hiding that tape from your son?!?!!?  What did she do, leave it sitting in the VCR or on the floor next to the TV?  I hide my porno tapes better than that.  If it wasn't for that and a few other things that distracted me that were mentioned in previous posts I would have enjoyed the movie more.  That being said I give them credit for making a movie that tries to be more than a typical slasher-type film.  It attempts to put together a somewhat involved plot, and to a degree pulls it off. There were some images during the film that I thought were effective, and are still in my mind the next day.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A classic for all time
","Though I haven't seen this film in a while, a combination of this movie staying with me and just creating my IMDB acct. compel me to comment. There are so many classical and bitingly humorous scenes in this movie where can you even start?  From the pop machine to the scene at the end where they are deciding who the 'survivors' will be I loved the comical edge that this movie provides.  Sellers is at his absolute best while George C. Scott plays such an unforgettable character.  I almost feel it would be redundant to mention Slim Pickens riding the bomb it is so obvious.  This is one to own and should be mandatory watching at least once a year for anyone who has a satirical sense of humor.",Null,0,0,19 October 2001
