Who Framed Roger Rabbit," I can not think of a better movie.
","I saw this when I was very young and my parents thought it would be a kid's movie. Well, yes, and no. I can say that it was a very original and incredible way of telling a story, blending the world of cartoons into the world of humans (from what I remember of it. I was very young). Robert Zemeckis is now one of my favourite directors. I have since then become a movie buff, as you can tell, and this was probably what started my obsession with telling stories. I already liked cartoons, but the fact that this consisted of both cartoon and real-life worlds put my faith back in the real world. If I get the opportunity to see this one again, I wouldn't just watch it, I would keep it!",Null,0,0,10 April 1999
The Waterboy," I can think of nothing better than 'stupid'.
","I looked up this movie and I thought to myself 'Hey this is worth a look'. I read the user comment. 'They obviously haven't seen an Adam Sandler movie before'. I know I had, and that was 'the Wedding Sinder'. That was a fabulous movie. I realise that all I can expect would be a few laughs, so I decide to see what it looks like. Now I wish I hadn't. 'The Waterboy' was the least funniest, most ridiculous movie I had ever seen! The plot was reminiscent  of a great many amount of Disney movies, the jokes couldn't possibly be classified as funny, and the acting, scripting, directing and producing were atrocious!!! How all of my friends managed to enjoy this is beyond me. The thing that gets my goat about Adam Sandler is that he thinks that just plain being stupid is funny! He thinks that he is funny! I was on the verge of walking out of the cinema when I remembered that it was a social get together and I didn't want to disappoint my friends. But if you're just alone and you want to relax and watch a movie then walk past this one!",Null,2,3,16 April 1999
