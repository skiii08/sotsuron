Black Swan," A beautifully violent masterpiece in every single way, except for one!
","Black Swan is the story of Nina trying to become the top performer in her ballet class. This film absolutely portrays what some people 'feel' rather than act like in the pressure of the spotlight, but it does it in a horror movie kind of way and this is what makes it brilliant! Black Swan caught me off guard. I kind of forgot what Darren Aronofsky's films were like. Boy was I in for a roller-coaster ride!I gripped the edge of my seat every time the dancers tipped on their tip toes (sound funny right, but a good director can make anything possible). That's just the beginning. There will be a lot more reasons to hold on to your pillow.Every scene is acted out perfectly by the actors, and Natalie is no different. Another reviewer said she usually has no trouble showing skin, but here she does the opposite and does it perfectly. I completely agree! Natalie certainly made this movie what it is!The only flaw of the film, in my opinion, is the sexual scenes. I do agree that maybe this delves in to the nature of the film, and maybe a sheltered, schitzo character like Nina's would go through this in real life. But it was hard for me to accept when the rest of the film shows how chauvinistic men can be. Yet chauvinistic men would probably enjoy this scene. To me that's kind of hypocritical. THERE IS a way to shoot a sex scene without making it like a porn video. So I think this could have been done better.Also this movie just isn't for anyone and I can't give a movie a 10 that is like that. Maybe if the sex scenes were toned down I would.(Contrary to what some reviewers say, sheltered people like Nina are very common in all walks of life making this very believable!)",9,2,3,24 July 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Light the candles!!!!!!!!!! Time to make love !!!!!!!
","Synopsis; Wedding stuff, baby stuff. Jake get's mad. Basic love tri. The Good; Great movie length. Fresh soundtrack. Teaches morals.Neutral; The acting is neither bad nor good. The Bad; No Volturi. Horrible CGI scene. One scene skips over some important info, and was rusdhed(left me confused).Opinion; 100% made for females. Wedding, Baby, Love Triangle = Perfect Formula. The action scenes, and moral reasoning for fights are left out here. Like a Lifetime Channel movie, despite one or two really great scenes. A really watered down Darren Alonofsky film. A Mormon undertone disturbed me on a religious level and on a basic level. Not sure if it was intentional or not. Funny; The dialog really bothered me because Jacobs tribe uses a word 'imprint' which makes me think of having sex or peeing on a tree every time it's used. Expectations; For the 3rd installment of a huge franchise I thought this would be a little bit more epic, but I can see why they split it in to two parts. They kind of made a cool little story out of this one, but not epic at all. Overall this was a decent film.",8,1,7,26 November 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," 'Let's get Skrazy'-Nicki M.
","Synopsis; Unique love relationship stories told with a whole bunch of famous acts you already know. It works.Awesome; Script, good acting, actually funny at times, tough moral lessons learned, great soundtrack, actors enjoyable despite being so overused. Both types of fans of comedy should enjoy this. Marisa Tomei still kicking it strong here. Almost reminds me of a Spanish actress.Poop; You might not like how it's almost all famous actors, risqu√© scene and situation (I don't personally like this). Could be worst. Overall a really great film! I could probably watch this again with friends.",9,0,1,26 November 2011
The Town," Good watch but highly overrated movie.
","I could explain this plot in detail but it's kind of familiar. It involves robbery, guns, and death. It also includes some great actors and they fit their parts well. But you already knew that.I've seen this before....not once, or twice, or thrice, but a million times under Martin Scorsese or mimicking directors of him.This was a great watch yet I really got board. I thought the movie would escalate in to something a little bit better than what I had seen but it never climbed above any thing else. If this is your kind of film. I recommended it. If it's not don't waste your time.",6,0,0,27 February 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Power, Promise, and Pretentiousness......dang-it!
","Captain America is acted by Chris Evan's (Fantastic Four). Chris is fiery, and his story reminds me of the recent Spiderman movies in that he's genuine as a youngster. I liked Hayley Atwell too and thought she was a good fiery fit alongside Chris Evan's. She was fun.Where Cap. Amer goes wrong is with special effects and action. Though there was a couple rad stunts. The action seems faked, and rushed, and litters the movie. 'Dangit' I had that type of feeling. Cap'in was dang fun, and awesome. If the producers would have just gave it a more simple vibe (keep one or two good action scenes and focus on the story) This all would have worked.Than there's a twist which attempts to make up for all this, which I respect. I can't go into detail as it is a spoiler. But this gives you another reason to watch. Overall I had a good time, but I did feel like this was Forced just to get the Avenger movie out. With more care and simplicity this could have been great.",7,2,5,12 November 2011
The Village," One of Shams best!
","Just an all around great M. Night Shamalayn movie. Love what the movie is about. It's extremely interesting. It's sort of a classic. The acting was very successful and believable otherwise this movie would have bombed. I don't think most critics take this into account. I also like how 'mysterious' this movie comes across. It's an attribute Sham drowns out with Lady in The Water and The Happening but does not here. The acting of Bryce Howard is her best thus-far along with Adrien Brody, and Joaquin who are also phenomenal like usual. Lastly like all great movies there is a really thought provoking end to round it all out.",9,0,1,30 December 2009
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Apetastic! One of the best films of the year!
","I'll keep it short and sweet.This movie has a great story line. James Franco does a great job. The Apes are awesome. The action scenes are a lot of fun. Lot's of good characters (counting apes). Sequel ready.The only thing that bothered me is that the Ape's head size was slightly off for different scenes. That's about it. They can always go back and fix that before blu-ray.-------------------------------------------------------------------- Note to Planet of The Apes fanatics; This is rewritten! That means that plot holes don't count. It's not the same exact story. You guys keep ruining the best films (also X-men First Class) with your reviews. These are the new versions, so plot holes don't count when comparing it to the other series. I know it sucks but it's still a good film. In comics and in general things like this are completely rewritten all the time.",10,2,4,16 August 2011
Kick-Ass," Great yet crosses line.
","Amazing script. Great characters. Re-watchable vibe. Has everything a great movie should so it's sad....I have to say I can't understand the point of expletives etc. but when the little girl (Hit Girl) get's in to vulgarity and keeps repeating those words I have to doc this movie two points. I just could't watch this around kids, or with people because I would never want to leave that kind of impression on any body. That is the persona of a great movie. It's sad because this just misses. I know young kids will copy off of things in this movie especially if Hit Girl is saying it and that really degrades somebodies character and could make a girl feel guilty, or cause problems for parents at school. If some fine tuning would have been done Kick would have still been in your face yet respectable. But hey if this director wants to make 'Fast Food' style movies that people will just throw in the trash that's his loss.",8,0,4,23 October 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," An unexpected philosophical masterpiece!
","In the beginning of The Adjustment Bureau you see, David, Matt Damon's character run for election. It's kind of a lighthearted moment. These moments come and go throughout the film adding to it's dynamics and making it more than another conspiracy thriller a la' Bourne Identity or Taken.As The Adjustment Bureau moves on it unwinds into a stunning work of art sometimes churning out cheesy moments but rarely, in exchange for romantic desire and philosophical mind bending, along with occasional action.Matt Damon and Emily Blunt perform their very best as usual. They seem destined to be together despite what seems like a whole universe keeping them apart. The array of Adjustment characters are also remarkable and are not too pretentious (though it get's close, they we're chosen wisely).Also Anthony Mackie plays his character gracefully while pushing the film above average for a great story with a wide array of good characters. With just one more unique character I would have given this a 10.One of my favorite films of the year!",9,1,1,12 March 2011
Super 8," Goonies mixed with Jurrassic park! An almost perfect film!
","Super 8 growls like a classic. The name Super 8 is derived from a kind of film used in old films. It's about a group of young kids filming an amateur movie. Joe, Alice, and hilarious character, Charles stumble upon some secret government information which opens up the film. Elle Fanning, and Kyle Chandler do an amazing job performing their awe stricken roles! Along with that there's a lot of cool tricks going on, like how there's a movie in a movie, and a lot of comedy which makes fun of movies themselves(clever;).Super 8 does almost everything well, from the 'production value' (you'll understand after you watch it), to the 1980's cinematography, to the acting, and to the directing. Which even though the film states is all Abrahms, you can really feel a pull sometimes back in forth between scenes that Abrams company may have done, or scenes that Spielberg may have done. The films becomes a little slow in the middle, but it's nowhere as slow as with most movies that do this, the rest is just so good that it's noticeable.Overall this film is completely re-watchable, and I think almost anybody could enjoy it. That's why I gave it a ten. Go see it!!",10,2,5,4 July 2011
In Time," Rad. Fun. Realistic. Pre- Steam Punk.
","ENGAGING. The story of In Time shows us what life would be like when ideas like credit, loans go too far-into the world of birth. Timberlake and Seyfried (Letters to Juliet) are timeless. I can't wait to see them work together again! From love scenes to action scenes they mix well, but not without a few artificial takes. Complimented by Cillian Murphy (The Dark Knight, 28 Days Later), Olivia Wilde, and Johnny Galecki (Roseanne) the movie soars. CLOSE CALL!!! I was almost sure all of these (previously mentioned) actors would ruin the movie but they don't! Olivia does an amazing job here, better than last two movies, and Galecki tried his hardest to blend in and it works. As for Cillian Murphy I thought he did the best here showcasing the details of his past without saying much at all. I thought he would also ruin, but he did the opposite!The cinematography was ravishing. I loved how this movie had a 40's aura, similar to Batman! It really made the world come alive. This is a great way to balance futuristic movies. You also get a 'girls with guns', Terrintino, Anime splash blended in to everything smoothly.The directing was great. There were a lot of great running shots and action scenes!BONUS; There's a lot of great moral chatter here, and it makes In Time current, and fresh. Population control is a popular, with those of Hillary Clinton mentioning it recently, and China already enacting laws with birth. This movie will only become more important as time goes on. This is a great stand out feature that you don't find in similar movies, though sometimes the clich√© moral dialogue is too repetitive.See this before time runs out!This is the best movie I've seen on this topic.",10,1,6,5 November 2011
Zombieland," Zombie Rockalypse!
","Zombieland stars Emma Stone of Superbad and now Crazy, Stupid, Love. It also stars Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine, Woody Harrelson, and Jesse Eisenberg.While I wasn't sure what to expect at first. I was glad I watched the film.I won't tell you how the characters interact for fear of spoilers but these 4 vandals, really are vandals surviving during a Zombie apocalypse and they all have great chemistry.A good amount of humor is mixed in here as all 4 characters have the dynamic ability of working in comedy. But don't shy away this is still a zombie movie and a pretty nasty one at that.....Blood and guts, blood and guts, blood and guts. Let me say it again...it's here along with a great script.It looked awesome in HD. Go watch!***The only reason I didn't give this a 10 out of 10 is because some of the cursing, especially from Eisenburg felt forced and fake. Was it acting? Or was it because in these kind of movies writers try to force the F bomb in too much? I'm not sure but it was super fake and it's not funny. I am sick of dirty movies especially when it's B movie esk.",9,0,2,23 January 2012
X-Men: First Class," XAULTING! One of the best X-Men scripts ever written.
","In First Class we intimately get to know the heart of Charles Xavier, his relationship with Magneto and his desire to protect the X-Men. Also we see the X-Men struggle with their identities in what comes across as one of the best X-Men scripts ever written (there are a lot of different versions). After watching this movie you can see why The X-Men have been around so long. Women's rights, equality, being oneself, revenge, war and much more take place without getting confusing.From the very first scene there is no blink story telling. This is obviously a trait of a great film but this is matched well with great acting (especially on Mcavoy and Fassbender's parts) and a self conscious wittiness, a rarity for this kind of flick which helps set this film over the top.",10,2,6,4 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Voldermort shakes his head. The most disappointing of the series! *Critics afraid to be honest!
","I was very unsatisfied when I left the theater. I felt like the creative team behind the movie gave up! I did enjoy this, but I also got board.Here are ten reasons why;1. The 3-D was a waste.+ Can't they make freaking lens free 3-D glasses!!?2. There weren't enough fantasy creatures, and unique special effects that made the first couple movies feel as if you were in a unique world!! HP 7 felt old and boring. There was no environmental depth and this ties into the movie being 'setty' (see 2nd to last point).3. CHEAP. I was expecting big fight scenes not a average two man brawl. There were better fights on the last couple of movies. There wasn't enough blood and bruises (for a finale) and when many characters got hurt or died you didn't see anything! 4. The opening scene was like watching a really bad reality show where there were abundant pauses and script stumble and lots of awkward silence. Also after 7 movies I'm sorry I need to be refreshed. I can't remember everything!5. PLOT HOLES! One that bothered me the most was in the first scene, Luna was present, later on she just seem to end up at a place Harry didn't know about. Why wouldn't she just tell him she was going there? If the world was ending and you and your friend split up wouldn't you tell them where you were going? He acted like he was surprised. I thought maybe she was evil an hiding it. 6. No Dobby. No Rubeus spotlight. These two characters are some of the best and neither of them made great appearances here. It's sad. A finale should have all the elements of the last couple movies combined. It would have been awesome to see Rubeus fight more! And to make it worst he has a lackluster scene with Harry that just plain sucked. There was no joy. It was boring. As far Dobby, I feel like they are saving him for the nest series and I felt like it was a money issue...in that they needed a reason for me to watch the next series (though maybe this was from the book for if they make another Harry).7. The ending!!! Good luck getting over the 30 year old Harry Potter and Hermione! I can't believe they didn't save that for the blu-ray extras! I felt like this was a SCAM and that they were just trying to set up the next Harry Potter franchise! Yuck. Great way to ruin a movie! 8. The dragon!!! Come on it's an awesome dragon! This is fantasy land! Do more with the dragon! Hey how about some 3-D flying angles?!??!! Instead he's chained up and BOOORRRRRING. Maybe they were following the book. I don't know.9. Next this was 'setty'. FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING THEM ON A SET. During one scene all these people are around watching a fight go down than the next thing you know characters run away and go fight in there own little rooms. A big scene get's set up than Harry and He Who Must Not Be Named literally walk away and fight in the same old cheesy castle. 10. The kissing scenes (if you want to call them that) sucked!-------------------------------------------------------------------With just a couple tweaks, this GOOD movie could have been GREAT!*Also it seems to me, after reviewing movies for awhile now that a lot of Critics are afraid to review something so popular so poor due to the fact that soccer moms, and easy goers may start to dislike them and stop reading their reviews. There's no way on God's green earth this movie is as good as they say! Harry Potter 7 reminds me of M. Night's Last couple of films!!",1,14,32,16 July 2011
Cloud Atlas," Masterful makers pour out love, life, liberty, and death!
","While your coffee or tea sits brewing imagine a couple of blank lines on a piece of paper. You can do this in your head.On the first line write 'comedy', on the opposite side of that write 'drama'. On another write 'animal cruelty', on the opposite side write 'emancipation'. Imagine one more and on this write 'sci-fi' and on the opposite side write 'gangster' and so on and so fourth. Add contrasts of any popular 'rights movement' or 'movie genre' together for the other lines. Cross the lines at their center. Now spread them apart evenly, while they stay pivoted, like on a pinwheel. Lastly draw a circle, connecting all the outer ends of the lines. Pretend to run your pointer finger down the side, spinning the lines in the wheel while they sit on their axis. Watch them spin. That circle is this movie. It theoretically tries to be the best movie marketing event in history, balancing the whole 'sphere' of what something can be to everyone in a single piece of art work. But in someways I feel like Cloud is a movie version of Starbucks. Cloud tries to dominate delightfully bowing down to everyone. It even goes as far as to lavish film critics and film elites everywhere. But I have to admit even... I... love Starbucks. So punk rock, anti-modernist, or hippie roots aside, this is still great coffee despite it's single flaw of domination.If you don't know by now Tom Tyker of Run Lola Run and Perfume worked on this film. It is probably influenced much more by the risqu√É¬© smell of the latter. You may have heard that the creators of the Matrix series played God in this epic actor heavy film too, but don't forget that they also made Speed Racer and V for Vendetta. All their past experiences are thrown on the table for this theme park of a 'flick'. But don't worry you will get your money's worth, this picaresque film is a three-hour long 'park special'.As far as the actors. The Wachowski's and Tyker woefully and tediously molded these infamous creatures into the beauty that makes them ageless, and in someways I mean that literally. Then to make the play dough stick there are some little production perks that drizzle rewatchability all over this film, and they know it, as you will be treated to something special at the end of the film like a good waiter tending to it's guests.You will be happy you watched. In someways I could see this masterpiece transcending time as one of the best films in history. But I'm not the judge, we the consumer are, and only one of our scientific gods, time, will tell.On politics: Some people might feel like this film is liberally slanted, and it is in some ways. But I feel I can look at this in many conservative ways as well. The directors might not like that. Who knows. But I have done this many times through out. So I encourage you to not shy away and look deeper as sometimes the best artwork has the most meanings.On 9 stars: I couldn't give this the supreme ten star rating because there are some occasional scenes where the make up is a little fake. I just couldn't get past it. To be fair the 'bearer of the flaw' makes up for it but to say why would give away some excitement. More accurately Cloud Atlas is a 9 1/2 star movie.I can't give much more info about the film. I feel like that would ruin the experience for you. So go watch it for yourself!Smell the aroma.Enjoy.(after you watch the movie you will see that there are many hidden puns & meanings in this review, just like in the movie. but we can't give them away. how ironic)",9,59,116,24 October 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Worst of the series. This movie was made to make money, save money, and for young children and old adults who like obvious scripts better than clever scripts.
","I'll keep it simple; The acting is worst and better at the same time. Making me dizzy.They added a sprinkle of comedy, when I thought it's strength was darkness.To make it worst it's somewhat feels like 3rd party comedy, which means that people in the movie's own world wouldn't get it because it's about this world...boy jokes about Joseph and Edward for example.This was hyped to have more action when in fact in did not, and when it did it was even more cheesy and artificial than before. Example...the vampires bursting into stone by getting punched? Cartoon anyone? In the trailer I got this idea like it was gonna be a mega blockbuster, since it will prob be the biggest movie of the year, and there was no fighting in the big city like I thought, or any crazy blockbuster stuff.The Vulturi. They really didn't do anything. I thought their would be a big fight scene with them and everything. I was hoping they would have a big chunk of the movie and they didn't.And last but not least. She chose Edward....and I noticed some girls cry because their team didn't win.A real shame. How do you please both teams?",6,4,8,6 July 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," A twisting, pretentious, house.
","Cabin in the Woods, starring Chris Hemsworth, seems like an intellectually frightening movie at first. In the preview you could see walls spinning, technological glam. I was aware of the fact that this was more of a 'teen' targeted movie but it still seemed worthy.I have to say after watching this I enjoyed it. The acting is decent, but the story is better. The story carries on the ideas I got from the preview which are satisfying. Yet there are a couple of real 'monsters' that haunt the film in the following minutes.Meet the 'beast of pretentiousness'. Maybe the directors/producers love B-Movies or maybe it was just a project gone wrong. Towards the end Cabin starts to get messy. Even that I can handle but when you mix that with cheesy CGI it really makes Cabin unrealistic. There are lots of great special effects but than they throw in one or two unnecessary computer animated monsters. It's just a waste.In addition a famous celebrity shows up who does not fit the part. She was literally put in the movie because of who she is not because she made the movie better. She plays nicer characters, better.Also there was nudity which is a waste in my opinion, this always ruins horror movies, boobs don't make something scary. Really I should dock it three stars for all of this, but because some people might like the b- movie aura I will give it eight. It was still fun to make fun of, and it had a great story.Overall enjoyable.",8,0,2,27 September 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A transformation of great strength, yet has some scars!
","Dark of the moon is breathtaking. The Transformers look ultra impressive, and they sound mind blowing. The actors are on fire. Shai Labouf and the new Rosie Huntington-Whiteley go great together and their acting is infectious. To start remember to watch this on the biggest T.V. possible!This is where the 3-part infection starts. On one hand Dark of the Moon is amazing. On the other it has serious flaws which is EXTREMELY SAD because this could have been the Star Wars of it's generation. What Star Wars had was flash + all the other great stuff. Dark of the Moon has flash, but it only has some of the other great stuff.Infection I: Pretentious = why people dislike Michael Bay, you can really feel his arrogance in the movie. There are some unnecessarily stupid and glamouresk scenes that just seem fake.Infection II: Confusing, but honestly it does a great job of not losing you. It's not as confusing as Pirates of The Caribbean 2 and 3.Infection III: The Autobots and Megabots are indistinguishable. Not only do their personalities burn out, but there was one big scene that me and my wife couldn't tell who was good or bad because they all looked the same (colors). The only AutoBot (that's not a leader) that gets good development and some screen time is Bumble Bee, and I'm kinda sick of him.Despite the flaws Dark of The Moon makes up for most of them (except the last one I mentioned) with some of the most amazing action scenes I've ever scene, also with a nice tune up of comedy throughout. I'll be watching this again, and on a bigger T.V.",9,13,19,17 October 2011
