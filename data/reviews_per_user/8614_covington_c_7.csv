Blade Runner 2049," If You Missed It...
","You missed it! Once again I'm back to leave a review to counter all the negative feedback! First of all, as far as sequels go, Bladerunner is exquisite! A TRUE sci-fi gem! I actually had to watch it a couple times to comprehend just who was AI, & who wasn't! & I'm expressing it just this way NOT to give up ANY spoilers.Ryan Gosling delivers that same cool, calm & collective demeanor that he gives in Drive! He really is underrated as an actor. Casting is on point.As far as staying true to the original Bladerunner, the visuals & cinematography are superb. Score... same synth sounds, which hardly make the sequel seem like it's almost 40 years later!Storyline was plausible, as far as picking up from where the original left off... compensating for the decades in between the 2 movies. Great cameos! & Denis Villeneuve pays wonderful respect & homage to Ridley Scott's version of the original Bladerunner!This is more of a cerebral movie, as opposed to CGI. If you prefer the latter... Star Wars movies will probably be more for you. If you appreciate conceptual sci-fi, that deals with technology & consciousness we've yet to even fully understand, then you will most certainly appreciate this GEM!",9,3,14,28 August 2019
Hereditary," Really though!?
","Unbelievable craptacular bs. I mean just nonsensical worthless indescribable trash. Started with great potential, but loses itself the further it absconds into the rabbit hole of implausible absurdity & ridiculousness. Your time would be better spent standing in a corner with your nose wedged in it, instead of investing 2 hours of your life watching this dud.",1,6,13,22 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Queen... is KING!
","Really an exceptional movie. Rami Malek is to Freddie Mercury what Jamie Foxx was to Ray, in that he embodies the part fabulously. Great supporting cast. Even if you're not a Queen fan you will find the movie entertaining. If you ARE indeed a Queen fan, this is a MUST SEE bio film. LONG LIVE QUEEN!!!",10,3,9,1 November 2018
Django Unchained," STANDING OVATION!!!
","Acting was impeccable... even w/ the lesser named actors/ actresses. Needless to say, Christoph Waltz & Jamie Foxx were exceptional! Storyline was great. For those who complained the movie was too long, the movie was true to run times of classic spaghetti westerns. Time was slow... there was nothing but time back then. And for those, .. well, that's personal politics. I absolutely LOVED the movie & have watched it several times, just to see the shoe on the other foot. Without a doubt this is a classic Tarantino movie... among his best!",10,1,5,6 August 2019
Drive," Exquisite Noir Cinema...
","For those who gave this movie a low rating... you CLEARLY missed it. Shaw & Hobbs is probably going to be more your speed.Drive is an EXCEPTIONAL noir piece. Ryan Gosling is PERFECT as 'the driver'... the same way he is in Only God Forgives & Bladerunner 2049. He CARRIES those movies... the same way he does THIS one. He never over acts... & does cold-blooded grit with a superb nuance. I can see how many actors would pass on such a violent movie role, but I'm glad we have an actor who steps up to the plate & DELIVERS, time & time again in such roles.Easily one of THE best wheel man movies, ever made. I gave it a 10 to counter all of the unnecessarily harsh criticism.Hop in the driver's seat & give this movie a spin! Hope you enjoy & APPRECIATE it as much as I did!",10,3,6,12 August 2019
The Lion King," Really... SERIOUSLY!?
","Why remake a classic simply using updated voices & cgi... b/c the ORIGINAL talented actors/ actresses voices are lost on millennials? Hollywood has become lost on itself, pushing remakes & reboots, when there's absolutely NOTHING wrong w/ the originals. Why people even continue to spend their money supporting this garbage is beyond me. I certainly did not & WILL NOT. Movies have become so unoriginal it's PATHETIC! As long as such is the case, I'll continue to be overly critical of such effort... or lack thereof! As for 'spoilers'... how can there be spoilers for a remake from a-z!?",1,39,57,9 August 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Propaganda Smoke & Mirrors!
",False story about 'the man' peddling his-story! Acting... sub-par. Storyline... snoozer. Nothing to see here... unless you're easily sold on lies & bs.,1,2,4,21 April 2020
