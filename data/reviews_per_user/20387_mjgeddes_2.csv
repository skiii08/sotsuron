Mission: Impossible III," Classic action movie
","Saw the movie at the opening session. A real classic. This is a real adrenaline-pumper - as heart pumping as actually riding a roller coaster. Fantastic set-piece action scenes - the settings, tension and effects set a new bar for action. Greatly superior to both MI1 and the very disappointing MI2.The action is well paced and augmented with great dead-pan humor, good acting, reasonable plotting, exotic settings and cool gadgets. Tom Cruise is in fine form as indomitable Ethan Hunt. And there's good chemistry between him and Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell).This time Hunt is in pursuit of a black market dealer and something mysterious known as 'The Rabbit's foot'. He's attempting to save the life of his girl-friend who inadvertently gets involved in the action- shades of 'True Lies'. The good news is that the atmosphere of this movie is less like the dreadful extended rock video that was MI2 and more like the thriller-cum-action that was MI1. There's some intelligence to it.None the less the plot is merely padding to the rock 'em, shock 'em action scenes, which are the very epitome of cool.",8,4,8,4 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Decent X-Men flick but not as good as 1 or 2
","Fans anxiously await the final installment in the series. The question on everyone's lips: Is it any good? The good news is that it's O.K. It's a reasonably entertaining end to the series with lots of action, spectacular effects and a fun script. Trouble is, it's just not as good as X-Men 2. Or even X-Men 1.The bad news is that there's simply no intelligence in the plot-lines. That's what 1 and 2 had. Intelligent plotting. Here logic seems to have been abandoned in favor of action and effects. Exactly why did Xavier confront Jean Grey in the house alone and why did the house have to go flying? Exactly why in the finale did Magneto have to re-arrange the Golden Gate bridge to get across the water? Surely simply catching a boat would have been easier? And how on Earth could a simple injection cure mutations so quickly and easily? In the end Magneto is reduced to looking like a bumbling klutz in a cape, which he never was. And the supposedly formidable intellect that was Charles Xavier is vanquished earlier in the movie with scarcely a fight. Give us a break! On the other hand the action scenes are spectacular, fun and effective. Jean Grey returns as the Dark Phoenix and she is certainly a very powerful character - the most effective in the movie. The awesome (and outright scary) nature of her powers clearly projects through the screen and into the psyche of the audience. Dark Phoenix rising up from the lake is a sight to behold and it really does appear that she could be the 'next stage' in evolution. We again see plenty of Wolverine and Storm in action and there are some great quips in the script. There's a great Wolverine scene - Wolverine is in his element fighting to get past the sentries in the forest in a covert operation. If one can forgive the woefully silly nature of the finale, it's still great eye-candy, with mutants using their powers in entertaining ways.Entertaining but forgettable action flick and an O.K end to the X-Men series. Nothing more. But nothing less.",7,0,1,25 May 2006
