Casablanca," BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!
","There is no doubt in my mind that Casablanca is the best movie ever made. Its absence of flaws and abundance of excelences makes this movie irrisitably good. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman only adds to this films excellence.  Also, the comedic relief in a somewhat dark plot from Claude Rains and Peter Lorre never fails to amaze me.  Many people say that Citizen Kane is a better movie, but that film, although excellent, does not have the quality that Casablanca does.  What I mean by that is most people know numerous lines and scenes from Casablanca(some who haven't even seen the movie) and I frequently hear it quoted n everyday conversation.  I cannot say the same for Citizen Kane. The combination of these elements makes the perfect formula for the greatest movie ever made, CASABLANCA!!!!",10,1,2,2 January 2004
