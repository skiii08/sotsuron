The Blair Witch Project," the strength of the acting
","the BWP does little to terrify me, as i'm not convinced by the supernatural... relying so heavily on inbuilt fears instead of presenting a framework i can immerse myself in would always result in my apathy regarding 'scares'...having said that, BWP succeeds in a completely different way... it is (to me at least) a fantastic example of utterly convincing acting... completely organic and believable (except for kicking the map into the creek)...having said that there are some memorable visuals, and the final scenes are creepy if you allow them to play on your fear of real dangers... by this point though, you either feel the threat is supernatural or not... i felt it did stem from an otherworldly source, and thus it was critical to the idea of what type of 'horror' movie i was watching...this movie is out and out a drama centering on group dynamics in the face of a life threatening situation... the disintegration and loss of the 'public face' is brilliantly done... as a small survival drama, the BWP is bleak, unforgiving, and hard to bear...it also touches on the impact of the camera, what we show and hide, how we see the world and our right to report from behind a lens...i would never recommend this as entertainment... it is a tour de force, but it is demanding... watch with care...",7,0,2,13 February 2006
Alien: Resurrection," killed the series dead
","i've heard plenty of complaints about the exactly-what-i-expected 'alien vs predator', but frankly, 'alien resurrection' is one of the most unforgivable travesties in film history...this movie is so bad that i'm going to make a generalisation (which i know is invalid, but still): french directors should not make big action blockbusters... see 'the fifth element', 'leon' and 'brotherhood of the wolf' as exhibits A,B and C...sigourney weaver is just terrible in this... shades of a bad linda hamilton impersonation... winona ryder is dire... the rest of the actors looked like bit players in a bad terry gilliam rip-off... the finale has to be the worst execution of a potentially interesting idea i've ever seen...i'm going to give it a point or two just because it's good to see the phallic wonderbeast back on screen... this movie is frenetic, 'zany', banal and lacklustre... it lacks any sense of pacing that the three earlier films exploited (in different ways) brilliantly... the visuals are very 'green'... this is obviously the edgy colour of the day...in fact 'AR' managed to avoid just about everything that made the other films stand out in the crowded 'space monster' flick genre... i suppose you have to give credit for trying to do something new... but the bawling, putrescent creature at the end was plain embarrassing... what a waste of money...if you like slime and bullets, give this a go... otherwise, wait for it to be tacked onto an alien box set or to appear in a bargain bin sale...",2,1,2,6 February 2006
Happy Gilmore," lowbrow classic
","happy gilmore lives in a strange place, now inhabited by ben stiller and the cast of American pie... that lowbrow, idiotic type of comedy that requires very little work from the viewer to generate laughs...however, happy gilmore is funny because of a few reasons... movies like this are steam trains; they need to be fed jokes, one liners, visual gags and zany scenes the way a burner needs coal... without them, the movie slows down and slides back down the hill...happy gilmore is relentless in its provision of funny moments... it's a juggernaut, wielding a crazy protagonist and an absurdly unlikeable villain... somewhere, the chemistry was just working...happy gilmore is not intellectually challenging... however, it does not pander exclusively to the bodily fluid and innuendo craving audience... it's hardly very mature, but it's not mindless either... it rather choose to play on the fairways, in the interesting world of pro golf...taking on a subject like golf was a stroke of brilliance, because it is a fertile area for basic humour... it's very nature makes it ideal... instead of drugs or relationships, we are given the gentlemen's game...it's the same old sport movie cliché, but it just seems so fresh... the jarring juxtaposition of the common man in a sport characterised with big money and a sense of elitism... it works brilliantly...adam sandler is excellent at physically conveying uncontrollable, explosive anger... it's hammy in its own way, but few do it as well... he's zany, he has good timing and delivery, and he doesn't let it dip too far into sentimentality... this movie had great pacing, a decent script for a film of its type, and it blows some of his later films out of the water...if you can put yourself in the right frame of mind, few movies of this genre could be as satisfying as happy gilmore... the formula is tired now, but this movie is a cut above...",7,1,2,30 January 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," Aiming for mediocrity is worse than failing totally
","I haven't read the book or studied the history surrounding the events in any detail, so I'm not really concerned with those aspects (which seem to have been the major gripe with the movie judging from the comments). The problem I found with this 'bodice ripper' is it's just a bit dull. Although the costumes are quite pretty, the only way the film maker seems to convey excitement is by cutting to scenes of people riding horses... hard... with dramatic music. There are no set pieces in the movie. It's just a soap opera really. I started to feel like the castle had four or five rooms in it.I'm usually fond of Natalie Portman. She was terrible in this movie, incapable of extracting sympathy or condemnation from the audience. Totally miscast and out of her depth. I was quite surprised anyone bothered casting Eric Bana in the movie - they could have got by with a much cheaper option since his role is very small. Scarlet wasn't bad. Kristin Scott Thomas actually stole the show.The script was odd. I kept getting that sense of anachronism - like when Anne says 'You'll have to show me how you did that sometime'. This is acceptable if you're making a movie set during a historical period with a different slant (see A Knight's Tale or Marie Antoinette). It's a bit jarring if you're playing it straight.It's quite a short movie, and that's a good thing. If it hadn't been, it would have been far more ponderous with its curious lack of passion. What a strangely wasted opportunity. Oh well. I guess I've seen worse. Although some of the worst movies I've seen have at least been memorable.",5,5,8,29 April 2008
Juno," This movie is like the twilight zone without the funny special effects
","Who on earth would actually want to know someone like Juno? Her indier than thou monologues are just lame. I've seen episodes of Gilmore Girls and Dawson's Creek with better precocious run on rants (I think we all know what I mean). Most of the time she's offensive. The scenes with Jennifer Garner are hard to watch because the silly lead character tries to belittle her.The two weak subplots are sub par. I found the whole 'husband wanting to get with Juno' ridiculous and creepy. I love the way she blows him off after wanting him the whole movie through. I felt no sympathy for Juno at any point. I agreed with the ultrasound technician. As for the boyfriend thing, I can't believe he got back with her. She's unbelievably obnoxious.This movie is so far removed from reality it should be classified as science fiction. Everything from the parent reaction to the constant pithy dialogue - it seems like an imitation of twee teen shows imitating life. Nevertheless, a lack of reality is acceptable if it's what you're going for. I'm not sure what Juno was trying to achieve. It's not funny, insightful or interesting.Kudos to Garner. She pulled the odd rabbit out of the hat. I've now finished watching the trio of baby movies - Waitress, Knocked Up and Juno. Trust me, this is by far the weakest.",3,6,12,14 April 2009
American Beauty," surburbia
","unlike some, i find the topic of the mediocrity of suburban life to be very interesting, as i can relate to the environment... often people say that these tales are of no value, and that characters in these settings should 'just get over it'... or 'why does anybody care about a bunch of spoiled boring people?'...i'm not of the opinion that suburban life is irrelevant... it's the situation many people find themselves in, and in it people face different struggles... perhaps not as monumental as fighting giant worms or dodging terrifying political violence, but still valid and human...thus, i have watched many movies that tackle the subject... a common slant is to infuse a little fantasy or poetry in the otherwise mundane, which brings out certain truths or extrapolates on the human condition...American beauty is no different... while other movies like 'lawn dogs' firmly establish the fairytale idea early on in the movie, American beauty plays quite straight until its main character's fantasies are used to unlock hidden truths about the world he lives in... objects are given dreamlike significance, etc...American beauty also slips into an unlikely set of events, much like the awful 'desperate housewives'... our protagonist (played by kevin spacey) attempts blackmail to fund a life of teenage ambition... he gets a job at a burger place to annoy and frustrate the people in his life who have in turn, annoyed and frustrated him...what American beauty struggles with is its innate heavy handedness... at times the wisdom dispensed in the movie is trite, or just lame... it suffers from its absurd events, and clichéd ideas of people... if someone doesn't agree with your idea of fun, they're probably in the closet and violent...still, annette bening gives a great performance... it is funny and charming in places, and it does make you think... a good movie to see to introduce the idea of satire, social commentary, and drama... similar movies i've seen have been slightly better however, like the solid and bruising 'safety of objects', or the devastating, vicious 'happiness'...i don't think this movie is a classic, but it is powerful and interesting in places... it's sad that the IMDb doesn't allow decimals, because this would be a 6.7 or so... worthwhile...",6,2,4,25 January 2006
The Usual Suspects," am i missing something? nope.
","right, so this movie is really clever?... at no point are we given any clues regarding the twist... so it could have been anything... how bout i write a movie where a guy tells a story about a heist and all the things that happen, and then everyone gets killed by aliens that appear out of the blue in the last minute of the movie?... what a twist!... you never would have seen that coming! despite that, the ending is very predictable... the fact that kint is the only one left is a dead giveaway... i'm usually terrible at spotting the ending of even the most predictable Hollywood fare, and i had this one pegged 20 minutes from the start...so is the script any good WITHOUT the twist?... i think quentin Tarantino has got the funny banter between tough guys down pat, but this movie?... total snoozefest... just a bunch of one dimensional hoods engaged in a boring, pointless quest (i couldn't even be bothered to follow the story as without the twist, it's very dull)...you know, they accuse shyamalam of being a one trick pony, but at least the sixth sense has some good acting, atmospherics, a creepy story and a script... some type of silent fascination...this movie is unbelievably overrated... i might have given it a 4 or a 5 but it really deserves to be taken down a peg or two, as i cannot see ANY justification for this being in the IMDb top 250, flawed list or not...and if i have one more person with a joint tell me it's genius, i'm going to puke... i hear that expression the emperor's clothes bandied around a lot on the IMDb, and if there's any movie on these boards that does deserve that over-used put down... well you know where to find the usual suspects...",2,18,36,6 January 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," porcelain clichÃ© time
","this movie is a porcelain vase... beautiful to look at, but empty...interlinking the fight scenes are very ordinary, stilted bouts of dialogue, the worst being a silly flashback in the desert...i was doubtful about this movie, but i loved ang lee's 'sense and sensibility' and 'the ice storm'... so i thought i'd give it a try... it's like a bad kung fu movie trading the humour for great visuals and a pseudo-deep story... i know the flying was in line with an ancient storytelling tradition, but it looks awful in a 'serious' movie...i've heard that this movie has deep philosophical meaning... i don't see it... it's a weak, minimal story with wooden acting... it's boring (especially the love story in the desert... AWFUL)... i turned to my friend who had come with me, and i apologised for picking the film... she just looked at me and said 'what am i watching?... no-one acts or talks like this!'... we had a good laugh about it afterwards...i read one of the comments here that said no western writer could match the 'amazing beauty' and 'exploration of heroism' of this story... all i can say is, it ain't Shakespeare... if you feel the urge to watch a compelling Chinese movie, try 'raise the red lantern' instead...",4,1,6,26 January 2006
Moulin Rouge!," post modern
","moulin rouge seems to be a movie that fiercely divides people...although i am not a great fan of musicals, moulin rouge manages to force feed you absinthe and drag you through the streets of Paris that never were... yes, it is not a deep movie... the performances are over the top... that is baz luhrman's modus operandi.. this movie establishes its agenda early and does not apologise for it... it is a sumptuous honey drowning visual romp...the use of modern songs is, in my opinion, brilliant ... i've read lots of comments vilifying the movie for its incorporation of modern pop culture, and to those people i'd like to say: 1) contemporary pop music has some good, witty lyrics (admittedly not everything in MR fits the bill)... no less than many older, 'classic' musicals...2) all genres adapt... just because this is 'not done' in musicals, according to some arbitrary panel of experts, doesn't mean anything... it's been done now, and it is a post modern film... that's what it set out to be, and importantly, it pulled it off... it may not work in every movie, but the skill of the director has made the difference...3) i'm not going to pretend that hearing 'smells like teen spirit' mangled didn't hurt, but as used in the film, it fits the context and is a justifiable choice... i'll deal with it...4) if some people would be objective, they would concede that the arrangements in MR show that popular music translates easily into the light opera setting, with the correct treatment...5) this is a possible springboard to convert people who don't like musicals...now, the editing and camera-work is frenetic, but it displays a sense of style completely unique to the director... people compare this to music videos, but apart from the speed and energy, i don't see it... luhrman may use common elements but he does impart his own sensibilities... the music video business is categorised by how similar all the products are (and some music videos do break the mould and provide exceptional visuals anyway)...the sets and costumes are magical... there is no denying it... jim broadbent is superb, and those who say mcgregor can't sing are just fools, or bitter...if you accept that just about nothing is original (certainly not the churned out musicals of the early days of Hollywood, that quickly established stereotypes and parameters that are still being used by bollywood) and that post modern works can be valid, vital entertainment, then you will accept that moulin rouge is wildly enjoyable... it is a slight movie in some respects, but there are flashes of gravity amidst all the noise, fervour and pomp...i think baz luhrman has pushed the genre of screen musical forward (kicking and screaming), and this is commendable... i think he has even prophesied the backlash in an earlier movie (the brilliant 'strictly ballroom') which had the dancer hero chastised for 'flashy, new steps'... the light musical has often been a platform for light, sparkling entertainment, and a little injection of flash can be easily dismissed by purists... but those adventurous viewers in pursuit of a good time will find it, come what may...",7,1,2,6 February 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," wet dream
","this movie is a sort of adolescent wet dream... ninja woman who acts like a cool man and looks good in a tight suit kills people with a samurai sword...this movie has pitifully little dialogue, and it doesn't have that usual Tarantino snap... what had a delicious pulpy quality in earlier offerings, now comes off as shallow...i suppose we should praise QT for making something a little different to his usual stuff, but frankly, this movie is coma inducing (and it's not really that far out from his previous work)... the chapters between the fight scenes seem like a glass of warm, flat beer... and QT has served up some crisp refreshing ale before, so it's even more disappointing... after the millionth decapitation, mutilation, spray of blood etc (the gore is not shocking, it's so cartoony that you can't really feel anything) you just think: 'this movie doesn't hold together and it's boring'...i'll give a few points for the odd spectacular fight scene shot... but frankly it's not a visceral experience, it's not clever, and i left my teens behind six years ago...a cheap kung fu movie with expensive production values... and that ruins whatever magic those types of movies have... oh and the anime stuff in the middle just feels out of place and forced...",4,5,9,20 December 2005
Con Air," drops the ball every time it catches it
","i'm at a loss on what to say for con air... it's a popcorn movie, something you can appreciate on its comfortable, abysmal nature, but still...i'd like to give this a 6 but every time i sort of got into it and was enjoying myself (even though it is laughably bad) they'd throw in a SUPER bad scene like cusack speaking to cage's wife... it was just too vomit inducing...i don't know if the scenes of cage running in slow motion with flames behind him and his hair whipping in the wind made me want to laugh or cry...and the ending just went on too long and demanded too many hurdles of disbelief to create a 'let's top ourselves every 20 seconds' finale of tackiness and excess...bottom line: it's a big dumb movie, and it's fun because it's utter garbage... but it could have been much better if it just moved along at a better pace and jettisoned SOME of the cheese... watch at your peril...",5,2,4,10 January 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Unlikely
","this movie is just implausible... i know movies do not need to always reflect reality to be entertaining or good, but this movie rode the 'realistic' trump card at the time of its release... i'm sorry if i don't believe the FBI would field an investigation in remotely the same fashion as the one in this movie... hopkins hams up his performance as lecter, and i cannot buy into him for one second...i admit i have a faint bias against jodie foster but i still think this movie is irreparably damaged by the unlikeliness of the story... it's further hamstrung when you consider the BRILLIANT portrayal of lecter (who is not a very realistic character but wow! does cox do a good job bringing him to life) by brian cox in the older and superior manhunter... i think it's a mistake to give lecter the amount of emphasis he gets here, as he should not be the focus of this story...if there is any redemption, it's the fine, almost secondary performance of ted levine... he acts in a manner i might expect from a serial killer, and is at least somewhat interesting... too bad he plays second fiddle to a pointless, distracting and inexplicable main story...when compared this to similar serial killer thriller movies (ie. movies that ground themselves in fiction and twists) this film comes off rather badly to offerings like the bone collector, which is just a good old fashioned yarn... SOTL is at best boring, at worst silly...",3,7,19,6 January 2006
Vanilla Sky," weak
","this movie reminded me a little of cameron's 'singles'... the start of VS was far more 'romantic comedy' then the original Spanish movie that it is based on, namely 'abre los ojos'... however, unlike 'singles', which strode the borderline between schmaltzy rom-com and offbeat comedy drama, 'vanilla sky' drifts off into a mushy parallel universe where everyone is witty and charming...this blows the second and more challenging portion of the film out of the water... oddly enough, 'singles' also had a startling change of pace... where that was handled with deft, wrenching brutality, VS flounders and drowns...too light to be a drama, too strange to work as a comedy...it also sports a soundtrack i would normally applaud, with the likes of radiohead and sigur ros (and others)... but the songs would surface in the worst way, only highlighting the dreamy soft spots or the sunny, mellow acoustic strum parts... this heightened the teenage saccharine feel for me... i think our director has become a little sentimental...i guess most people would accuse me of trying to score cool points by recommending the original, but it really is a far better movie... the lead character is more interesting, despite being thoroughly unlikeable... i guess tom didn't want play a part people might despise...oh and cruz phoned in her performance this time around... it's time to 'open your eyes'...",5,0,2,20 January 2006
Sin City," nice visuals, shame about the movie!
","this movie is not completely without merit, in that the visuals are impressive in some scenes... but it hurts that so much time and effort could go into lovingly recreating something as bland as the sin city comics appear to be...i'm speaking from the point of view of someone who has not read the original comic books this movie is based on... according to many of the comments here, the movie is a VERY accurate in relation to the source material... too bad, eh? the movie is made up from three separate stories, using the same location and some crossover of characters... however, these stories do not seem to have much impact on each other... this is not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case i kept expecting the plots to tie up cleverly with each other... this didn't happen... not much cleverness happened at all, unless you count the CGI boys back at the film lab...Bruce Willis heads the cast in the first story, 'That yellow bastard', and he is his usual, likable self... Bruce Willis defies the bad/good actor tag for me, as i usually like him no matter what, even if the performance is poor...the storyline begins promisingly, then fizzles into a sort of very poorly developed male fantasy... it's the usual unlikely scenario leading to a very young woman digging an old guy (quite a Hollywood staple, except for when they switch it round to having a hot 16 year old girl digging a 13 year old boy)... he resists her, there's some random violence using the ridiculous villain from the first part of the story, and the noble end... this one is the only sin city instalment to be split into two halves, the last part making up the end of the movie... skip the last half, it'll just ruin the memories of what came before...the second story follows mickey Rourke (who i think is an underrated actor) as a hulking ex-con chasing the killer of a prostitute 'who gave him the night of his life'... by now the narration will be starting to annoy you... i appreciate a certain amount of cheesy dialogue is needed, but it just gets far too cheddary...you'll also notice something halfway into this plot line... sin city has NO clever stories... it doesn't really have a story at all... lots of bursts of hyper violence, atmospheric shots of the face, cheesy dialogue, back to the hyper violence... i'm not really offended by violence (nothing in this movie seemed offensive because it was all so ridiculous) but i found the repeated gore to be dull and tedious... this movie has no substance whatsoever...some of the things that happen in this part are just plain unbelievable... i know it's a comic book, but the scene of Marv getting hit by a car numerous times... well it's just dumb... then he gets knocked out by one blow with a sledgehammer... dumb again...the actors try their best... they might has well cast a complete unknown for Elijah wood's part... could have saved some cash there...anyway, this storyline was only a warm up for the crowningly bad moment in the movie... the big fat kill! be amazed at the blandness of Clive Owen...be astonished at the worst line i've heard in a year, at the end... if you need a pointer, listen out for the word 'valkyri'... be dazzled by the pointlessness of the plot, coupled with its illogicality...this is when it hits a new low... there's one good morsel when benicio's character Jackie boy starts talking after being killed (i think this scene was directed by Quentin Tarantino, who i'm sure had a hand in directing the warrior woman Japanese sword swinging babe scene too, even if he won't admit it)... it's a neat scene...they could have quite easily left this one out and developed the other two a bit more... which brings up my point about the tie-in...*SPOILER* the two psycho killers from the first and second stories BOTH USE THE SAME FARM TO KILL WOMEN... doesn't it get a bit crowded?... it seemed very unlikely to me... sorry i just had to mention that...all in all, it's a seriously boring movie... it could have been 90 minutes, with more story, less gore, and the same great visuals... instead... it's just cruddy...",3,8,16,5 January 2006
