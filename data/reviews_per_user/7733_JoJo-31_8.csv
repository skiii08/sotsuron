Ghost," I can and can't understand!
","I can and can't understand about the way the Oscars went with this movie. I'm glad Whoopi Goldberg got her Oscar because she deserved it and the screenplay was good, but this movie should've gotten best picture too. Ghost has a pretty good storyline although I don't see how Sam would want to kill Carl and Willie after he finds out that they killed him because they were dealing with drug dealers so they wouldn't get killed.  Other than that, it was great too!  And other than the swearing, I felt Sam's anger and rage when he finds out why he was killed, especially when his friend betrayed him.  I'd be pretty mad too! I mean, we all have one life, why take another?  And after finding out that Rick Aviles was also a comedian, it surprised me that he could play a killer and not show any comedy at all except for the part when he jokes around after Carl told him about Oda Mae Brown knowing about him.  When I first saw this movie, although I was only a little kid, I thought it was a horror movie because of the objects flying at Willie near his death scene and then the demons from Hell coming and taking him.  That part gave me the creeps.  Although, being the spiritual Christian I am, I am not agreeing with the way they handled life after death in this movie, overall this movie was excellent.",Null,1,2,1 June 2000
Training Day," Denzel Washington + Butthole = Oscar for Best Actor
","Wow!  This is an awesome movie!  I saw this movie after Denzel Washington received his Oscar for Best Actor because of this movie so I thought that he must've done a real good job.  When I finally saw this movie, I was not only impressed, but also a little shocked.  The only movie I can recall seeing him in and remembering how he acted was Remember the Titans, and he didn't even come close to acting like a jerk in that movie.  A really awesome cop movie!",Null,0,10,28 April 2002
Scary Movie 2," DEFINITELY better than the original!
","Scary Movie got me into liking the Wayans brother, but Scary Movie 2 is definitely better than the first.  If you saw this movie the first day it came out at 2:40 P.M. up in Fairfax, Virginia then you'd agree with me because everyone that was in the theatre was laughing their butts off during the movie, including me.  Heck, the first ten minutes kept me laughing although I'm not much on preachers swearing and not living the Christian life (I'm a very spiritual person), I don't even care if they try to do it just to make an audience laugh, but other than that, hey, the movie was excellent.  I may sound this way, because I'm easily amused, but I really loved this movie.  Not only do they make fun of movies, but also the Presidential Election recount and Firestone tires and I believe they had every right to.  If Al Gore hadn'tve been such a winey-baby, there would be no need for this, but he was, and Scary Movie 2 made fun of it.  I recommend this movie to anybody who likes the Wayans brothers and likes comedy.  Trust me, you'll get your money's worth on this movie.",Null,0,1,18 July 2001
Remember the Titans," Heartwarming and Heartbreaking
","Oh, man!  Now if this movie doesn't touch your heart, as I can see from the reviews, it hasn't on some people.  Remember the Titans is such a wonderful story.  Now, I'm not really up for movies that base it on a true story concerning sports, don't ask me why, but this one is an exception.  The acting was good and it just shows how ignorant and closed minded people are when it comes to the human race.  If we were all white or black, I'm 110% sure this world would suck.  Heck, the funny thing is when the fights happened in this movie, I pretty much rooted for the black people, not saying I'm going against my own race, but... It was such a joy to see everybody finally getting along and it was also heartbreaking towards the end when they lost their star linebacker to a car accident to only have him watch the championship game from his hospital bed to getting killed in another car wreck 10 years later.  I've only seen this movie three times, but I guess the old saying third time's the charm is really true because I liked the movie before, but I wasn't really as touched as I was the third time.  I think what would have made this movie better is if it took place in the south where the real racial hatred still lingers on today, like in Georgia or Alabama.  Also seeing that it takes place in my birthstate of Virginia, and not too far from where my dad lives, in fact, I think my aunt or somebody she knows went to that school around that time, it was totally breathtaking.  An awesome movie!  Go buy it!",Null,0,0,21 October 2001
Major League," I don't understand
","I don't understand why people think this movie sucks.This movie rocks, if you know what I mean.  I'm talking about 'Wild Thing'  yeah it sure is a wild movie, and in a good movie are conflicts. There's Roger Dorn against Ricky Vaughn because he is a rookie, Eddie Harris against Pedro Curenno because Curenno believes in a different religion, and Lou Brown against Rachel Phelps because, well, she's just a bitch.  So, all of you people who think 'Major League' sucks, why don't you watch it again and again.",Null,0,4,10 December 1998
Platoon," Very emotional!
","This movie was very emotional!  Tom Berenger played a very cruel character with no heart.  I was so glad when Charlie Sheen put a bullet in him, not saying that I don't like Tom Berenger, I just can't stand someone who's so mean and kills his own man and even women and children who haven't done a thing.  I felt so sorry for the women and children who were torchered in the movie when yet they haven't done a darn thing. If this movie did take a real part in the Vietnam War, I'd say then this is why we lost, because we fought ourselves and let the enemy kick our butts.  A real good movie!",Null,1,3,31 December 2000
Halloween," 1st Place Tie!
","I'd say this movie's in a first place tie for the best of the series with Halloween H20.  This is my first Halloween film to watch and I was impressed.  Unlike the other horror movies I was actually frightened by this one.  I knew that Annie was going to die, but I didn't know when and when Michael sprung up from the backseat and whacked her, that scared the pants off of me.  And just seeing Michael finally appear in the closet when Laurie discovers her friends, that part haunted me for a long time.  I'd be frightened in the dark in my own room for quite sometime after that. Overall, one of the best Halloweens I've ever seen.",Null,0,0,22 November 2000
Princess Mononoke," An awesome film!
","This film is one of the better quality animes I've seen in quite awhile. The animation was awesome, the voice-acting was great, and I loved the story.  I'm not going to go into what the movie was about, (I'll let you find that out for yourself  =) but I will however add one comment, and that is even if you're not interested in anime, this one's still worth checking out.",10,0,1,16 January 2001
