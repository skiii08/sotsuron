It," Outstanding! Not so much scary as it is engrossing
","I went into this movie on the fence about it. I did like the trailers a lot, but the film was extremely hyped and I wasn't THAT excited to see it. However, it blew away my expectations. One thing this film did extremely well was tell a story. No, it wasn't all that scary, but more of a mystery/thriller, which was OK with me.The cast was perfectly cast, and everyone had great chemistry together. The film also really did an excellent job of creating a mysterious atmosphere around Pennywise and his taking of the children.Though the film was over two hours long, it didn't feel overly long at all. Overall, a great movie. It really captured the atmosphere of the small town and the events happening, and also did a great job of creating a mystery.",10,6,15,9 September 2017
Don't Breathe," Not a bad movie, but definitely overrated
","First, the concept was very original. Three thieves set out to rob a blind man of his money late one evening in a deserted neighborhood while he's sleeping. The film did a decent job of building up suspense, but not quite as good as I'd hoped for a movie like this. I never felt that feeling of dread like 'something bad is on the horizon' I felt while watching 'Halloween' or the original 'Friday the 13th'. Once the main characters break into the house, they soon realize that their piece of cake robbery of a blind man will not be so easy. My biggest problem I had with the film was that the blind man pretty much anticipated the thieves' every move. While this worked the first couple of times, it started to become repetitive and really worked against the film. Yes, he was a very smart war veteran with heightened senses of hearing and smell (worked for the film). Yes, his military training gave him an advantage (worked for the film). But over and over, the characters would try to escape, and he would be there waiting for them at the precise time and location when they arrived. It's almost like I got the feeling the writers wanted to make this character absolutely perfect, with no flaws, weaknesses or mistakes. That to me, just didn't ring true in this situation. I won't spoil it, but this was especially true near the end when it really seemed like the blind man had superhuman powers to escape any situation.Overall, a decent movie bogged down by its unrealistic character.",7,3,7,27 August 2016
