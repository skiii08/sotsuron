50 First Dates," Great Sandler movie, but there's something different
","Adam Sandler is back in full form with 50 First Dates. The slapstick humor, the gross-out laughs of Ula, it's all great.There are some parts where you feel Lucy's pain and Sandler's angst towards getting her to like him every day. It's different from his other movies like 'Anger Management'.A really funny movie. I'd definitely recommend it.",8,0,0,21 February 2004
The Italian Job," Very good movie.
","I really enjoyed this movie, and thought that it was great fun. I loved the big Mini Cooper chase throughout L.A. and all the traffic jams were just great. I liked the acting, it was pretty good for the most part. Overall, this was a fun movie to watch. 8 out of 10.",10,0,3,17 June 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Wow
","This was an amazing movie. The plot was weaker than I expected, however. The plot for 'Reloaded' and the original 'Matrix' was quite a bit better, but this movie made up for it in the action sequences and fights. The intensity and the feeling you got from those action sequences just blew me apart and put me back together again. This was an amazing movie, and I'm seeing it again. **** out of ****",10,0,0,7 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Wow!
","'T3: Rise of the Machines' is definitely the biggest movie of the summer. Amazing special effects dazzle this sci-fi thriller, and Arnold is back in full form. I was a little concerned going into this movie, considering the fun time was barely two hours, and in my homeland, Canada, it had received a '14A' rating. This worried me. The first two had been rated '18A' here, and I thought that it wouldn't live up to the expectations. I was wrong. The plot was rich and full, with a lot of twists along the way. I was really enjoying the car chase scene. The only thing they could've improved on was ACTING. I hated Nick Stahl as John Connor, and Claire Danes as his love interest was just lame. But the ending was what really caught me! It was beautifully done! James Cameron would be proud. After this, I say, march on T4! WAR OF THE MACHINES. 10 out of 10.",7,0,0,1 July 2003

Big Fish," An emotional masterpiece
",This was a great show. Solid storyline and great acting from the whole cast.Tim Burton scores again with a story that is a wonderful blend of both comedy and drama.One of the best dramatic movies I have seen in a long time. 10 out of 10.,10,0,0,25 January 2004
The Last Samurai," The Last Samurai
","The Last Samurai**** out ****Starring Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada. Directed by Edward Zwick.I always thought this movie looked great. When I first saw the trailer, I thought to myself, 'I have to see this movie'. I saw a sneak preview last night, and I have to say, it completely blew me away.The drama of this movie was more than I could handle. The way the samurai fought, the way they would never give up until the very death, and the way they loved life. This movie amazed me from start to finish. It starts off a little slow, but this allows you to see the development of Tom Cruise's and Ken Watanabe's characters.The action sequences were very well done. Since there was little CGI involved in this picture, it gave you a very real feel to the battles. They were very gritty, brutal scenes. It really hit you hard when the samurai were being shot with those weapons.In closing, The Last Samurai should be an Oscar contender for next year, and I will remember it as one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.",10,1,2,30 November 2003
The Hurricane," Excellent movie, superb acting
","I got bored at school, and decided to watch this movie. I was surprised. I thought it was going to another one of those weird dramas that just don't do it for me. This movie had depth. I really enjoyed watching it. I found myself getting involved in the story, wanting Hurricane to just bust out and win it all. I hope Denzel sticks to movies like this. *** out of ****",7,0,4,13 June 2003
Total Recall," One 'total' movie
","This was a very cool movie. The special effects must have been spectacular for the time. The plot was very rich, with many twists and turns in the story. I enjoyed myself quite a bit. Big, bad fun from Arnold Schwarzenegger. 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,1 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Greatest movie ever...
","...is all I can say. If I were to describe what was great about this movie, my review would be 100 pages long. This movie was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't think anything will be able to top it. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
