Casablanca," 'I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.'
","The Petrified Forest convinced the world Bogart was a bad guy. And for years he shocked and awed the audience with roles fitting that image. The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart, with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool. Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's Â– man comes with a heart. Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man's character and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it was Warner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, 'You're very kind.' Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.'I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.' Is said to be Bogart's last words. A legend, indeed.",10,156,197,6 December 2006
The Color of Money," 'It's something that you never think about, but it can make your day like electricity.'
","By far my favorite Newman movie. He's electric, returning as Fast Eddie. Cruise also shines in this film. Although Newman's acting was beyond approach in the 'Hustler'. The Color of Money is a completely honest sequel that is in some ways far better than the original.Sometimes I watch this movie over and over again, trying to figure it out. Who is the hustler and who is really getting hustled. It's been years since I first saw it and I'm never be bored with it. It's not just about what's going on surface, which is obviously pool. There's so much more too it. Life lessons.Some of the best lines you'll ever hear come out of this movie. I'll leave that for you to figure out. Cruise is one of my favorite actor's alive. I've never really seen a Cruise movie I didn't like. It really makes me sick what the media is doing to him lately. If you don't love this movie the first time you see it, just think about it. 'Take your time, I'll give you about 5 seconds.'",10,1,2,27 January 2007
No Country for Old Men," Why don't we just not end the picture and say we did?
","I paused it and I went to eat dinner.After seeing the first half of this film, I began to praise it. With tremendous efforts from Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, I thought I was settling into a memorable picture. Even the Oscar winning mommas boy, Javier Bardem, was giving everything he had. (Who is this guy again and why do I care?) The cinematography was beautiful. The drama was wonderful, building excitement with every minute. All was falling into place.Then I turned it back on.Big mistake. I should have thrown my Blu-ray player out the window. It should have froze up on me again. Then I might never know how terrible this film would become. How artsy and weak it truly was. But I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you that the film is horrible, it's not. Just unfinished and I want it to finish. I'm not inclined to review films I don't like. I do not feel the need to knock someone's vision because I was disappointed with it. But with all the praise and Oscar nods this film received, I felt the need to say well hey this was lousy. At first I thought it was just a flash-forward sequence and was comfortable with it. Then time started to run out and I was beginning to get nervous. I kept waiting for it to happen, but it just never did.This is not a great movie; this is a bad movie with great acting, which is almost becoming a clique in Hollywood these days. Terrible direction and no storyline. This movie could have been above average, but instead the directors got caught being too cute. Trying to make some sort of statement, which had no meaning to the picture itself? Instead of just ending the film, I was left with nothing. Don't get me wrong, questions for the sake of being mysterious is good. Questions that leave me saying what the #@*^ was that, is not good. It's really, really, really bad. In any event, I give it a 5 out of 10. For what they gave me, half a movie. And why do I want to see the so-called 'bad guy' win? The answer is I don't! Why don't we just not end the picture and say we did? I'm still waiting. Why don't I just not end this review and say I did?",7,9,19,12 March 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The hero that was a villain. The admirer that was a coward.
","Anticipated realism.Beautiful cinematography and direction. Some people say the storyline is misguided and sometimes dull, but I say with good reason. They are building something here. We all know the story. The American lure. Even though it's history and could be no other way, I didn't see it coming. I never expected the actual assassination to be so forth carried out.It was interesting to find that Pitt wasn't the focus of this film, instead we find Affleck deviling deep into the depths of desire and madness. The tension building with each disappointment or insult. How he did not win Oscar gold for this performance is beyond me. Instead it went to the methodic killer in 'No Country for Old Men' and not the reluctant one in Jesse James.Pitt gives one of his finest performances in one of his most challenging films. He didn't really need to say much. His presence captured all. Pitt may very well be remembered for this film, even with an ever-growing impressive category of work. The supporting cast also did a great job, with an outstanding showing by Sam Rockwell as the sometimes not so evident meeker Ford brother.In short, a psychological thriller that never fails to conspire.",8,14,23,14 March 2008
Rocky," 'But it's Thanksgiving. Yeah to you, but to me it's Thursday.'
","It's hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.Rocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn't like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn't so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It's about a guy, much like you or me, who's down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He's pushing 30, single and broke. I'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. It's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It's a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone's face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn't in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it's empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. It's more than beautiful or real.It's safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God's help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I'd want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn't care. Because, 'I'm at least half a bum.'",10,422,463,17 December 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Gift to us all. 'I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.'
","I'm sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn't matter what I say. As Stallone would say 'I'm at least half a bum.' The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I'll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it's release, I still can not forget.To say the most, it's a powerful film. The directing is world class. The camera work is haunting and the soundtrack gives me chills. It's Cruise at his finest. He is so convincing that one might actually believe that this guy is Doctor Bill Harford and this really did happen to him. And that my friends is the definition of acting. The seriousness of the situation fades away with a stern smile as the plot thickens.To say the least it is one of those movies you could watch over and over again. To be honest with you, I didn't buy it the first time I saw it. I thought it was good, but not great. Then one day I was bored, so I decided to see it again. And that's when it happened. Kubrick came alive. I became infected by his genius and captivated by Cruise's portrayal. His realization and his detail.It's hard to pick my favorite scene in the movie. I couldn't pretend if I tried. I particularly love the opening party scene. That leads to a 'Baby did a bad bad thing'. Cruise being assaulted on the street being so eloquently called a fag. The prostitute. From the piano bar to the costume shop. And finally, the unionized orgy party, that I find hard to believe doesn't really exist. Maybe only guys like Kubrick or Cruise will ever really know if they do or not.Many people might disagree with me when I say Eyes Wide Shut is one of the greatest films. But how come I think it is every time I watch it? To me, it's more than a beautiful work of art. More than a visceral painted picture or a haunting melody. It's a masterpiece that should be treasured.",10,560,752,25 September 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," Who are you, really?
","Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life. Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be. Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst. Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience. Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.",10,532,574,27 January 2007
The Thin Red Line," Theater of Ideology
","When I was about 7, I first saw Rocky on TV and I didn't really understand it. It wasn't until I was 18 that I came to the conclusion, that it was the greatest movie ever made. At 22, that all changed when I first saw On The Waterfront. Fully aware now that Brando was a god. The ultimate male. Never not shocking, bruiting desire. At 24 it was a toss up between Eyes Wide Shut and Casablanca. Cruise controls a certain air and Bogart was the coolest guy to ever live. Now I am at the crossroads of life and The Thin Red Line.This movie just does it for me. The fact that the whole story is told through poetry is quite a unique thing to do. To tell a story through words. And nowadays, by doing so they take a lot of risks. In all fairness this movie sacrifices capturing the general audience, for words that go together so beautifully. I wish more people could understand how great this movie really is and not try to compare it to other classics like Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now. It's a different kind of war movie. This one's on humility's side.Though it took me some time, The Thin Red Line has become my favorite war movie. I've always been a fan of Penn, this movie introduced me to Caviezel. He seems to capture his part with a justful beauty.It's hard for me to pick a favorite scene. The dialog between Penn and Caviezel is powerful. I have to admit that the conversations between him and Penn made the movie for me. They seem to be trying to out act each other. For example, when Caviezel says that he is twice the man that Penn is in one of the opening scenes. Penn gives him this look. I can only describe as a peaceful calm. One of intelligence that comes with age. Instead of overreacting to the comment, he sits back and understands it. I guess that's more of the writer's doing, but it is a beautiful thing.",10,108,150,30 June 2006
Born on the Fourth of July," You can take your Oscar and shove it.
","'The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to recognize excellence of professionals in the film industry, including directors, actors, and writers.' With that, let me ask you this? Does this film lack any of the requirements. Stone, Cruise, Kovic? Obivioulsy, Oliver Stone won the Oscar and deservingly so, as did Best David Brenner and Joe Hutshing for film editing. This leads us to Cruise and the man he became. Cruise is brilliant in this filmÂ…Period. He is at the pinnacle of his career and his realest performances to date. Later, with only 'Eyes Wide Shut' being a close second. After 'The Color of Money' Newman gave him pieces and Cruise put it all together. Ron Kovic, the man America almost forgot. I remember the first time I saw this movie. I must have been about 11 or 12. I was sitting home bored out of my mind on 4th of July. Flipping through the channels, I stopped on a Tom Cruise movie I've never seen. So I sat on the couch and watched the entire movie. And than something hit me. Something that I thought a movie could never do to a young man. I found myself in tears by the end.My favorite scene, what I consider one fo the defining moments of the film, occurs when Kovic/Cruise is drinking at a bar and tries to dance with a young girl. But he can't because of his chair and ends up on the floor. Everyone laughing. Nobody really ever cares. Has got to be one of the saddest things in the world, life is.Even if the fine gentlemen and women at the Academy refuse to say it, I will. Thank you Ron Kovic for sharing your story. Thank you Tom Cruise for making me believe.",10,2,6,13 March 2008
