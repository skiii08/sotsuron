Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," First there was God, then He created George; and he did entertain us all...
","All I can say is yes, do ignore the critics. The Master Genius has done it again (George Lucas is, in my opinion, not capable of making a bad film). This one happens to be a fast-paced, well done and very entertaining example of his genius. We all love a well-told story, and this one is just that! Good job, George (and thanks!)!!!",9,7,9,16 July 1999
