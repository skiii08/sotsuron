Catch Me If You Can," Just plain fun.
","This movie was a wonderful experience.  DiCaprio and Hanks were as good as ever, the pacing was quick and enjoyable, and the dialog was clever and quite funny.  Christopher Walken does a particularly fine job as Frank Abagnale Sr. and Martin Sheen is expert in his (albeit somewhat of a bit) part.It is also important to note that contrary to what some poorly informed commenters have said, no one was hurt by Frank's scams.  First, the money: the FDIC insures everyone against fraud and robbery.  No families lost their income, no elderly people became unable to retire and had to 'crawl off, unwanted, to some corner and die,' or any other such melodramatic idiocy. The only agency who lost money was the federal government; which admittedly isn't a good thing, but didn't lead to any elderly or cute animal deaths.*** Minor spoiler ahead, but a spoiler still ***Last the people involved.  The would-be stewardesses were not humiliated, they got a free trip to Europe (and back), and a great story to tell.  His fiance was reunited with her family, a much more important thing than the inconvenience and embarrassment he caused them.I don't mean to suggest that everything he did was benign and that we would be better off with a Frank Abagnale on every corner.  However, he was hardly more than an annoyance to the general public, and a wonderful story of redemption.",Null,0,1,3 January 2003
The Transporter," Great fun.
","If you're looking for great dialog, brilliant character development, or a deep evolving plot; look elsewhere.  If you're looking to have a great time at the movies; you've found it.  The Transporter is stylish, humorous, action packed, and just plain fun.",7,0,0,13 October 2002
