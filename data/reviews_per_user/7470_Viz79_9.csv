The Ring," It simply gets under your skin.. like a true chiller
","Truth of the matter is, I am crazy about horrors and am pretty demanding when I watch one. Coming out of the Ring, I wondered whether they missed lots of opportunity to scare the audience further. But I later realised that would simply have not been a good idea considering the state that particular audience had been :)The Ring is absolutely beautiful in its imagery and Blair Witch Project like in terms of using your own imagination against you. However unlike that particular film, this one gives the scares a much harder push so no matter what, chances are you you are going to be very tense throughout the film and actually be left with an uneasy feeling that you may not be completely aware of until later - a mark ofa  true chiller.Ive already ordered the Japanese version and well as the Japenese sequel and prequel - I am hooked, what can I say. However chances are, The Ring may be too much for you to handle. But if you love horrors and you want your ears little ringing at the end of the movie, watch this.",10,0,0,15 February 2003
Underworld," Easily the best pure vampire movie I have seen
","Before I went into see this movie, I was a little.. concerned, simply because of a couple of reviews I had seen. The trailers seemed like a dream because of the style and the content which I found really appealing. Come on, werewolves, vampires in a dark gothic setting battling it out.. if done well it could be a masterpiece.It is a masterpiece I can tell you now - never does it bore, but the story does captivate you, continues to twist and in the end it would be very odd if you were not satisfied on the storyside. The cinematography is again superb, giving you classic slightly grey view of everything and even openly shows some cliched gothic backdrops to indicate that it is very much the world that you would have thought of.The acting is more than adequate for something like this but the visual effects are great as well - it is not the Matrix and only shows the 'slow down' scene twice in the entire movie, yet the action is always interesting as you follow it all on screen.At the end of the day, I felt I was there, in a world where vampires and lycans existed and where at each others throats for their own reasons. And if this movie managed to achieve that, and had me coming out of the movie going 'wow that was superb.. Ill be watching that again, I want the DVD and I hope desperately for a sequel' you know you have something special.",10,1,1,19 September 2003
The Others," Horror with a beautiful story
","I can't believe the number of comparisons here with Sixth Sense.. I regard that film as being brilliant for its story and its twist but on seeing this one, I never even thought about Sixth Sense until now. Just because they have a similar idea doesnt mean that it blackmarks this film one bit and the shock from this twist fat outstripped the one from the other film.Simply put, this on first glance seems like a strandard horror tale told slowly and carefully and doesnt *seem* to have anything special about it until you see the point of it all at the end. While other users have posted spoilers, I have no intention of doing so but this is one of those films that shows how much it shines when you *think* back on what you saw through the film. Just like Sixth Sense, the twist raises the film to new heights. The acting and cinematics are brilliant as is the mood throughout the film and it gives a new *perspective* in horror films - a perspective not told many times before to my knowledge.Heartily recommended as a benchmark for future horror films.",10,0,0,23 November 2001
Silent Hill," The best game to movie adaptation and a top horror movie
","Silent Hill is a fantastic movie and is unarguably the best game to movie conversion there is - I can't imagine a single fan of the game being disappointed and more importantly fans of the horror genre can finally see a movie that takes them to a nightmarish world that refuses to hold back. While the story is close to the one in the game, there are substantial differences as well - so with this the game and hopefully subsequent movies all have 'different' adaptations of story lines.The only fault one could say the movie has is that one 'may' find the plot difficult to understand towards the climax but its important to note that a trademark of Silent Hill was always analysis and openness - nowadays movies are too happy to spell everything out for the audiences while in this series, one can finish seeing the movie and actually have to 'think' to decide what is occurring. However its much more easy to understand that the extremely complex plot of the original game yet still being faithful and so for fans - this is a must, and for non fans hopefully this will being you to a place we have enjoyed for so long and hope you will start enjoying :)",10,1,3,23 April 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," Much better than Reloaded and some great moments
","I think Revolutions does a lot for the series in terms of raising the series quality rather than lowering it further from Reloaded. The first was a landmark and a breathtaking movie, but the sequel was seen by most as far over the top in its action sequences. The third manages to land on the ground again with some absolutely spectacular moments and some interesting choices of characters and locales - the last in the series managing to be thought provoking. I also think that after Revolutions, people may like Reloaded a little more after seeing its importance and position in the middle of the trilogy.Overall, a very good end to the trilogy and a great action flick. And you should go and see it, even if you hated Reloaded since the film makers do redeem themselves some what.",8,0,0,5 November 2003
The Village," A movie that should leave you thinking.. if you are capable of it
","The problem with many of Night's films are that they require that little bit extra from the viewers - it did not start with Sixth Sense's landmark twist, but with Unbreakable's interesting theories which did not seem fantastical considering. But people these days don't want to 'give' in the cinema to get an additional experience.. it should all be easy viewing and all 'take'Now in The Village, we are left with a film with constant building tension, numerous twists altering the truth of the movie, wonderful acting but most important of all, asking *you* whether the life you lead is really the 'essence' of how it should be, or whether it was the villagers there that had it just right. People consider the movie a fantasy - but then all of Night's movies have been just that.. movies are about escapism after all.I wonder if this movie will only be appreciated in years to come on looking back rather than the current 'jump galore' slashfest horror generation that can't seem to grasp the simple beauty of The Village.I loved it and I think it is Night's best film, surpassing the Sixth Sense in its whole - go in with a thoughtful mind and enjoy a wonderful ride.",10,0,0,4 September 2004
Spider-Man," Best comic book hero movie yet released
","I have to say, I came out after seeing this movie and thinking 'wow'. Its not often that I come out for a movie and think that it was definitely worth seeing but this one was because it managed to capture a comic book character that would have been hard to display on the screen.But to just see him swinging through the city, the special effects managing to capture his agile nature is breath taking. But the story is surprisingly well done managing the portraying the characters to a depth that is unusual for such a movie. At the end, you will have really managed to get a good understanding of Peter Parker, Mary Jane and even the Green Goblin. This first movie has at its core a romance and while I was dismayed at the amount of romantic scenes during the movie, I realised how important they were at the end for introducing the character of Spiderman.The Green Goblin is a superb adversory for Spiderman but I wish there were more actions scenes if anything else although the ones that were displayed were unbelievable visually. But in maintaining a balance between action scenes, character depth and overall movie length, I am happy with what they chose. I am betting that the sequel will be more action packed now that the important character integration is done.I previously enjoyed X-Men but I think it pales in comparison to Spiderman which displays great skill in making you believe the fantasy story and how it could fit into a world like ours. I just can't believe I will have to wait for the sequel, argh!P.S I had always liked Spiderman but after watching this movie and seeing him in full splendor on the silver screen, I am now a *fan* and watching Superman/Batman/X-Men never did that for me. Go Spidey!",10,0,0,23 June 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A sublime scintillating experence like none other
","Kill Bill - Episode One... here was a movie that I had been looking forward to for such a long time. And what hype... I personally am a huge Tarentino fan... I was convinced by Reservoir Dogs and I was completely sold and enamoured by the truly excellent Pulp Fiction (and then later liked Jackie Brown but not anywhere near the level of the others), and now here is the fourth of his films, or at least the first part of it.After watching it, I sat there thinking.. this movie has not let me down one bit and I simply cannot believe how it delivered exactly what it said on the poster - 'a roaring rampage of revenge'. If anyone comes out of the cinema and claims that all it was was about 'killing', firstly, they would have missed all the undertones and issues that were present (and displayed in a number of superb ways including anime) and secondly, next time read the poster before you go in!From the sweet singing sound of the samurai blade being pulled out of the sheath by the master that crafted it, to the superb perfectly choreographed fights to the sensational dialogue, I can say that the only thing wrong with Kill Bill is that I know for a fact that when Episode 2 finishes, I will be dying for more. I am glad that Tarentino is likely to do an anime prelude because in all honesty, I can't get enough of these characters and this 'fantasy' scenario.But the main thing is - it is not just some movie with lots of deaths that is just a good laugh to watch. It manages to supercede even Pulp Fiction in the simple fact that what is created on screen just makes you bite your tongue and love every second that the film drips out. Well Pulp Fiction managed to do that too, but mix that with a great andrenalin rush and theres Kill Bill. With classic salutes to so many genres from Westerns to classic 70s Martial Arts to so many other things, I get the feeling that this film will be *especially* special for those that really love the kung fu martial art movies of old (and yes I did grow up on films like 'Snake in the Shadow of the Monkey'!).And then theres the anime - beautifully drawn, and haunting in its execution of the emotional issues. The music is superb and is a part and parcel of the fights to create a sensational experience. Ahh this can go on and on.. in truth, this film is simply a masterpiece and one I will be seeing countless times again. What can I say, just like the razor sharp Hattori Hanzo blade, the movie manages to inspire me and drive me and I could sit there for houts watching it with its monumental soundtrack.Bah this is too much.. go watch it for heavens sake and see what the fuss is about. Simply one of the best films by one of the top film makers ever. 10/10.",10,0,1,14 October 2003
Big Fish," A message from one artist to every other about immortality
","I have to say  this movie is easily the most inspiring I have seen as an 'artist' - a writer and story teller, and it seems as if the movie while being wonderful as a simple 'movie' also sends an important message from Tim Burton to others about just how one's work really immortalises oneself.
The simple premise is that one's creations be it a simple piece of fiction, a piece of art or a music will take a part of the creator, and everytime someone looks, hears or reads it, the creator lives again through the work. So years after he is gone, how he felt, his emotions his personality and his creations exist once more.And even beyond that there is the simple fact that the 'father' in the movie is a teller of 'Tall Stories' about his supposed life but the question lies - which one of us ever tells the complete truth? Our memories are hardly photographic and there is little doubt that when we think back on the times, they are always a little bit more polished, often the better times are more 'rosier' - not done conciously but just how the faded memories are interpreted. So really, which is the truth.. the one you tell everyone, or the one that really happened? Does it matter? The one you tell everyone is going to last much longer than the truth ever did as part of your memories and thus the listeners, and really which would you prefer? Life in its boring harsh reality, or a 'better' version with a rose tint and a bit of warm 'humanity' and 'fantasy'?This movie is based around that whole premise, and is truly heart warming, tear jerking and very funny - a true fairy tale that only Tim Burton can create. And as always, there is much to think abd talk about once its over - at the start one tires of the old man's stories and how surely they must be fabricated, but I bet that everyone wishes that he would continue telling them at the end of the movie :)I think this movie got a lukewarm welcome at the theatres because it is so 'unique' - there is nothing like this movie and people are not happy to embrace such things. But a guarantee is that when you finish watching it, at the very least you will have enjoyed the ride. At the most, you will take away something much more from you and maybe like me, some inspiration to be a story teller with the heart of the protagonist in the movie!Superb acting by the cast of course - Ewan McGregor has somehow perfected a smile that could melt a damn snowman, his older version played by Albert Finney manages to make you listen to his every word no matter the fact you know that he could be making it all up, and of course Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Busemi play their roles to a tee. And how can anyone ever forget Danny DeVito?!The cinematography is always a trademark of Tim Burtons - beautiful landscapes and visual feasts are in store. Nope, definitely one of my favourite films because it is such a personal one for me but even without that, it is worth every minute of your time. When else will you ever see a movie with the disclaimer similar to 'Most of this probably didn't happen' by the narrator and you were still mesmerised? Only once and this it it! Enjoy and thanks Tim Burton and the cast and crew. *standing ovation*",10,0,0,5 March 2004
