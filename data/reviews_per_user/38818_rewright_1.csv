The Blair Witch Project," Pretty Creepy, but not as good as I had hoped
","After seeing a genuinely creepy special the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' on Sci-Fi, I was so excited. While I liked the raw emotion of the film. I was not, ever more than kinda spooked. The 'off the cuff'  dialogue that  got really repetitive and the creepy parts were rushed, never savoring the anticipation. So for me it was not a masterpiece of macabre, but instead just a cool idea that became an ok",4,1,2,27 July 1999
