3:10 to Yuma," This is the best movie I have seen in at least ten years!
",The casting was top-rate. The acting was phenomenal. The photography was excellent. I would have definitely have Russell Crowe's babies now! Ben Foster was GENIUS! I was simply in awe of him in this film - so in character and soooooo believable. Everyone was just simply excellent. The only reason for the '9' of '10' is that Russell Crowe is supposed to me a mean guy and sometimes the writer does not allow him to be mean. Only that one small thing does detracts from 100% credibility to the plot and reminds you it's a movie and its Hollywood and its for entertainment so something can happen that is a bit magical or make-believe...something that might not have happened in real life. I still adored this film!,9,1,6,10 September 2007
