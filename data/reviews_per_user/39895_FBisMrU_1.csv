The Ring," Loved it!!!
","The Ring is the best horror movie ever! I loved it! I think it was great because it kept you guessing the whole{is that the right whole?} time and because it stayed on track. You know in movies you ALWAYS have to have romance? I hate that! And in this movie, it didn't happen. The movie was focused on its main point and I liked that. Plus I got a few screams in! But for those who are looking for a semi-scary movie, I don't think this is the one for you. I mean don't get me wrong, I probably wouldn't scream at all my second time seeing it. But anyway, it's a GREAT movie and I'm going to see it again. I just loved the ending!",Null,0,0,6 November 2002
