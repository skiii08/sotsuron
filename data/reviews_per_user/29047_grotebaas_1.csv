The Ring," Never seen something like this before
","I didn't know much about this movie when I went to see it. The only thing that I knew was that it was a remake of a Japanese movie. Apparently people died when they had seen a video...I really can't tell you too much about the story without giving spoilers so I won't :) It does start with the death of a girl. And she dies because she has seen that 'video'. The movie follows Rachel (Naomi Watts) as she tries to figure out what has happened to her (dead) niece.Don't expect a movie like Scream, Blair Witch, Jeepers Creepers, etc. No I haven't seen anything like this before. It's much better than those movies.There are a couple of things that make this a great movie. The story is of course the most important one. It has lots of surprises and at times is very scary. The other thing that makes this movie great is the way the movie is shot. I really liked the 'video'. It may not be that scary, but it makes you think... a lot.I really want to see the original Japanese version now...",9,1,1,1 March 2003
