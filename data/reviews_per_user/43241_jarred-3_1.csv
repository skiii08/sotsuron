Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thought it was junk
","I was a real Star Wars fan until I saw this hunk o' junk.  Most people, will want to watch a series of movies from the start.  Episode 1 had spectacular FX, however, people will be p***ed when they see that the next 3 movies look like crap.  Sure, the movie would cost a lot more without the FX, but it would retain its classic look.  Even more, this looked like a children's movie.  A 5-year-old would probably never understand Star Wars: A New Hope until he/she turns 6 or 7.",Null,0,1,30 April 2000
