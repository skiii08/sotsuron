The Blair Witch Project," Drivel
","I have to take my hat off to those who conceived and marketed this film. they did an excellent job. This does not however mean that I liked the film itself. All of the people I personally know who saw this film either loved it or hated it. There was no 'in between' rating from any of them.Although I appreciate that I am probably going against the opinion of many people here, I must say that I found the whole thing mind numbingly boring. Seeing people running around in the woods, having tantrums and bouts of immaturity is not my idea of a cinematic experience.Despite admiring the conception and marketing, I for one hope that this film is idiosyncratic rather than innovative because if it is the latter we will be plauged by such tripe for years to come. Still I suppose that this is just one opinion, which is maybe a minority one, and I sincerely hope that those who found that they like this sort of thing enjoyed it - and get well soon. (just kidding!!).",2,0,2,9 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertaining
",The critics were confounded with Star Wars episode VI and have again been confounded with The Phantom Menace. The public love the film and flock to it in droves. George Lucas must have the formula just right.The film is pure action and entertainment all the way. Combine this with some 'mystical elements' which appeal to the audiences need for a spiritual dimension and it all adds up to a great film.We could get bogged down with philosophical questions such as 'What constitutes a great film?' But what the hell - it is a film to be enjoyed and experienced. Enjoy and experience it then Mr Critic!!Keep it up George. I look forward to seeing Palpatine in action as Darth Sidious - The Phantom Menace.,8,0,0,28 July 1999
The Others," Haunting - not a film but an experience.
","This is truly great. The horror relies on suspense rather than the stalk and slash material that has invaded the screens for the last twenty or so years. The film develops slowly and is much the better for that.
I found that I appreciated this more by reflecting upon it afterwards. It was not simply a movie but an experience. Our experience of the events remains with the characters and develops with them to the ultimate revelation. I felt that the film had a claustraphobic feel to it and I did not like this at first but if anyone feels this I would urge them to stick with it because it is vital to the outcome.Also one of Nicole Kidmans best performances.",9,0,0,4 November 2001
Sleepy Hollow," Not for the squeamish but good supernatural suspense.
","The headless horseman galloping through the countryside lopping heads clean off their respective bodies, a late 18th century 'rationalist' detective, a superstitious village community and Christina Ricci as well (the best person to develop from child acting).Brilliant!! This is an excellent and absorbing story.As I have not read Washington Irvings story I did not really know what to expect. It became clear very early in the movie that there was indeed a supernatural cause behind the series of deaths (i.e. there was no faking the phenomenon by an errant villager for instance). The film does not however then plunge into a mass of pointless special effects and gore (although these were present in a significant way). It does in fact manage to blend a whodunit into the supernatural stew and a very tasty stew it is too. Despite the early knowledge that the immediate cause was supernatural there remained the mystery about who raised the horseman and who pulled his strings.The film is not for the squeamish but is highly recommended to fans of supernatural suspense.",9,0,0,9 January 2000
Megamind," A well developed movie for adults and kids
","Every so often I watch a film with limited enthusiasm, simply because I have time me to kill. On these occasions I sometimes stumble across a true delight and am pleasantly surprised...a film that maybe had 'mixed' reviews or that received little attention upon its release. Megamind is such a film; a great work of animation and character development.The film should delight adults and children with enough in it to satisfy all tastes. There is also plenty of amusing and hilarious satire with regard to superhero movies and super villains. Many superheros and villains are often depicted as wholly good or wholly bad, having at best some traumatic event setting them on their inevitable and unchangeable course. This film actually highlights certain sources of inner turmoil and insecurities of the characters in a very entertaining way and develops the characters as they work these out.There's also plenty of rip roaring action on the way.Great stuff! Highly recommended!",9,34,36,24 June 2012
Notting Hill," Light and Amusing
","The movie is a light and amusing romantic comedy. A thoroughly enjoyable modern fairytale! It transports the viewer into a world where love overcomes. There is little point in looking for deep meanings in the movie - it is simply but effectively, a light hearted acting out of the archetypal situation in which a member of the public falls in love with a celebrity. The lines 'This fame thing isn't real...' 'I'm just a girl looking at a boy and asking him to love her', as spoken by Julia Roberts did seem to come from the heart though. I wonder if she really believes this herself ? Mmmmm maybe there's hope for me yet.....!",8,0,0,30 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Contradictory impressions.
",I am at a loss about how to describe this film. I found it fascinating and yet overly long. Is there a contradiction here somewhere? I was admittedly mesmerised by Nicole Kidman and some of the secret society scenes. At the same time the film seemed to last for ages and became boring in parts. I really can't analyse it and I suppose that the answer is 'Go and see it for yourself'. On balance its probably worth it.,5,0,0,3 October 1999
Donnie Darko," Very Effective
","This was a very effective film. I found it in some way disturbing & inscrutable rather than enjoyable and I still find myself thinking the symbology and ideas through, no doubt coming to some conclusions that the scriptwriter did not intend. That's what, for me, made the film worthwhile. It is a work of art that one can think about long after the final credits.",7,0,0,14 November 2002
