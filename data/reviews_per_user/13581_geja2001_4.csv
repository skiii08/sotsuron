Catch Me If You Can," A great escape from a January storm
","Steven Spielberg, Martin Sheen, Leonardo DeCaprio and James Brolin -- what do they have in common besides a solid liberal base?  They, along with always great Tom Hanks, entertained us for a few hours.  All of us really liked this film, a rather serious story turned farce by the escapades of DeCaprio.  With Hanks and DeCaprio obsessed with each other -- both dependent upon the other for existence, really -- Catch Me If You Can ended in a very satisfactory way.  All the women were portrayed as silly, giggly, and super-credulous, making DeCaprio's jobs quite easy to arrange.  The striped scarf and matching cap on a stewardess were wild.  Watch the movement and the disappearance of the small gift (on the table at the 'expensive restaurant') DeCaprio tries to give his father/mentor/role model, played superbly by Christopher Walken.  DeCaprio's first deceit -- as the substitute French teacher-- set the tone for this film -- great, entertaining with a touch of sadness for the troubled son of troubled parents.  Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,11 January 2003
The Rookie," I liked the stories of the youngsters.
","I viewed the DVD rental of this wholesome, lengthy film not in one sitting but many.  Stopping the film was a welcome relief; I am not a baseball fan. As a basketball fan, I could watch hours and hours of 'Hoosiers' and the Duke Blue Devils -- so I guess that was part of my negativity toward 'The Rookie.'  I really, really liked the storylines dealing with young Jimmy (Trevor Morgan) and Hunter, and I liked the actors playing those roles. So to me a film dedicated to these relationships, contrasting and comparing, would be most favorable.  The scenes with the struggling Owls were great. This depiction as a mere chronology of events was too simple and rather humdrum.  Dennis Quaid was excellent in 'Frequency,' but in this film he was too old, too grizzled.  And those guys collecting somebody's and anybody's hair from the barber shop floor and then sprinkling (and still touching) the hair onto the field's surround - ugh!  I stopped snacking on my cheddar cheese Combos at those points.  A major plus for this film is that the viewer does not mind a family member passing through the room; no embarrassing scenes are part of this.  The true story that is included in the DVD is interesting, but what happened to the father and why was he sent to that tiny 1930-ish town to recruit?  And why did they stay?  I read that Morris is now a motivational speaker; does he ever meet up with the 'Rudy' fella. Wow -- talk about making the most of a situation!  I'll grade 'The Rookie' B-minus:  try harder next time.",Null,0,0,7 September 2002
Signs," Beginning was good, but ending was not so good.
","'Oh, no,' I thought.  'Dogs in a film about aliens.  I already know that outcome.'  Please, please don't allow any other animals to die in films - ever!  (Why did that stupid family forget their surviving pet Isabelle?)  I tell myself that this is fake -- but still -- I cannot sit through a film while anticipating those dreaded scenes.      My daughter and I liked the build-up to the invasion, and both of us (SPOILERS) were disappointed when 'he' was revealed -- kinda like a leather-clad mummy with a strong allergic reaction to fetid water.  We considered the boy to be a bad actor whose character needed some serious behavior modification.  When his father corrected the pronunciation of the author of the prized book on aliens (Was the purchase Fate or Coincidence? Ick!), the son did not like the 'tone' of the correction. What's with that? And how did that kid become an expert on aliens?  Did he read and recall the exact passages ole Father Mel would question?  (Insert ghostly music here -- Fate or Coincidence or Inane Writing?)  And director MNS's cameo was more like a supporting role.  We liked the corn rows -- like 'Children of the Corn' -- 'He who walks behind the rows (or something like that).'  *SPOILER* The ending with those fateful words about swinging away was tacky.  Why couldn't the wife have said, 'Leave the farm - take the dogs - go to a motel - swim away - remember the medicine - pack a lunch - put on the collar -- preaching is easier than farming - clean the house -- it's a mess.'  The film was a simple way to spend an afternoon, and not too much was lost - time-wise and coin-wise - So see the film if you favor eerie stories with a profound message attached.  I hope those German Shepherds and their stand-ins are sleeping in the Hollywood sun, bellies full and beds worn.",Null,0,1,18 September 2002
A Walk to Remember," A Few Questions
","Student life is familiar to all of us (if you're younger than five, you're not reading this!), so why do writers create so many unreal situations that make the film just plain silly?  Why were the yearbooks distributed so early?  Why did the director of the spring play select the players for each role, and why did she choose an 'unknown' for the male lead? Do students really write the plays -- with such adult themes?  Why did Mandy Moore's character leave the lunch room to go home?  Do students do that?  How was Shane's character able to drive here and there whenever?  Did anyone attend classes. or did they sit outside all day -- except when they were in that weird-looking lunch room?  I cringe whenever proms are featured in films: no one has a date until the week of the prom, the decorations are being decided that week, and the music/band has yet to be selected.  Isn't someone tapping the writer/director/whoever on the shoulder and saying, 'May I offer a suggestion?'  Oh, yes, thumbs down on this goofy film.  Give me 'Wuthering Heights' with Ralph Fiennes anyday and everyday!",Null,0,0,3 August 2002
