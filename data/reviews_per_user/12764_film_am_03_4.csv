Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A celebration of movies
","I haven't watched Kill Bill vol.1 yet. I watched Vol. 2 last night. It is an amazing celebration of kung fu movies, sphagetti westerns, meaningless action movies and all stuff that is cool. Its biggest strength is that the movie knows what it is doing. You are meant to take the movie seriously in a different way - not as in caring deeply about the characters and whether certain things happen to them or not - but how cool the movie really is. Quentin Tarantino has brought together an immense array of talent and has stacked them exactly the way he wants them stacked. That then is his genius, to know what exactly what you want to do and to do a damn good job of that. One of the most interesting and complete films from one of the most interesting and complete filmmakers. Now if only he took all his talent and worked on some really serious and meaningful themes ... that would be a challenge!",Null,0,1,20 April 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The best Harry Potter movie to date!
","*** The review assumes familiarity with the Harry Potter canon *** This isn't the perfect movie by any means. I'll grant that. For one, I'd definitely have liked more about Marauders and a much better clarification of how they were all related to Harry, especially Lupin. (This would've explained so much, like how Lupin could read the map while Snape couldn't and the significance of the stag patronus.) This is also the movie that deviates significantly (for the first time; the earlier two were rather slavish adaptations) from the book. But the differences are what I cherished the most. The whole time turner sequence is quite brilliant IMHO, cheesy but brilliant. There's absolutely no way Rowling could have written in all the visual flourishes and Kloves and Cuaron take full advantage of the possibilities presented with the whole time turner sequence. Sure it's sort of deus ex machina but that's the way it was written in the book and they couldn't possibly alter it entirely. For one, Harry, Ron and Hermoine aren't nearly quite magically or emotionally ready to do the whole thing right in the first go. So, while the deus ex machina weakens the whole plot a bit, this is about the best movie one can come up with, within the plot. Another small distraction is the very first scene when Harry obviously performs magic during summer, which he's not allowed to do. (And it gets stated explicitly multiple times in the movie!) That was a fairly major goof.Now about the rest of the movie. It's the most visually sumptuous HP movie I've seen so far, even narrowly better than Goblet of Fire. The only sequence I can think of where special effects were below par was the knight bus sequence. I also like this movie's score more than the rest so far. Some of the sets could be better but overall they're great. Cinematography is easily the best I've seen in HP movies so far. Darkening of the visual palette was done brilliantly and set the stage for the rest of the movies.Performances wise, the three leads are still finding their way. They each had good moments and clunkers - Harry when he cries at Hogsmeade, Hermoine when she greets Harry at Leaky Cauldron, and Ron when he freaks out in many scenes, for instance. Gambon was good as Dumbledore but there are portents of the disaster that came in Goblet of Fire. (IMHO, Gambon's performance was the single most disappointing feature of GoF. He just shrieks and shrieks some more. Whereas Richard Harris was delightfully understated, bringing out Dumbledore's experience, maturity, wisdom and humor, I don't even know who the guy Gambon plays is in GoF! Read the book and watch the movie - what a contrast!) Gambon was already showing a few signs of 'panic' in this movie. Then there are the three best perfs of the movie and how brilliant they are - Thewlis as Lupin, Oldman as Black and Rickman as Snape! They outdo each other and act circles around the rest of the cast each time. Alan Rickman, in particular, deserved some sort of nomination for his perf. Watch the scene when he finally asks Harry to turn to page 394 in the book. Years after watching the movie, I still remember the way his nose twitches then. I doubt he will ever play a role better than Snape's. William Hurt was given a supporting actor Oscar nomination in 'A History of Violence' for a travesty (over-over-over-over-the-toooop) much shorter than the brilliance of Rickman in this movie. While I don't claim Alan Rickman was robbed of a nomination, I definitely would not have complained one bit if he'd gotten one.Alfonso Cuaron has made absolutely fascinating movies, and in particular, movies with tremendous repeat value. He's someone to watch out for. I wish he'd come back and direct another HP movie.All in all, a good and worthy addition to the HP sequence. 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,1,20 February 2007
Hero," Excellently shot but a very disappointing ending ...
","WARNING: Major spoilersI thoroughly enjoyed this movie, until the last 10 or so minutes, which left me just as deeply disappointed. Believe me, I don't necessarily hate films with tragic ending, but there has to be a purpose for it. I saw no justification in the movie for the ending that it has, and in *this* aspect, the movie is indeed similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (where I believe there was absolutely no reason for Chow Yun-Fat's Li Mu Bai character to die).*** Spoiler-free zone (well, almost) ***The movie is vivid and stylish, with emphasis on images to convey the story. The dialog is minimal. There are excellently and surreally choreographed and photographed martial arts sequences.The story is this: The King of Qin dynasty in China wants to unite all the warring kingdoms in China under one rule for the sake of lasting peace in the land. For this sake, he wages war on all other kingdoms and these wars cause great deal of destruction. Four great warriors, who are great masters of amazing martial arts (and therefore in essence, the masters of the great arts and knowledge in the country) are pained by the bloodshed and want to assassinate the king, even though the fourth one is not a known assassin. (Each of them is shown to have a personal motive to assassinate the king, even though at least two of them talk at a level much higher than mere vendetta - about philosophy, sacrifice, greater good et al.) The king himself is no slouch even if he's not as great a warrior as them. He builds almost impregnable barriers to protect himself. So the fourth warrior, called Nameless (played by Jet Li), kills the other three, and as a reward gets an audience with the king and therefore a chance to assassinate him. The biggest plot twist is the argument of one of the other three warriors, Broken Sword, who is farsighted enough to see the merit in the king's wars. The question then is this: has he managed to convince Nameless to stop his assassination plans?*** MAJOR SPOILERS *** (I'm revealing the end.)Nameless finally sees the wisdom behind the king's wars and does not assassinate the king when he gets a chance. But what was the reason for Nameless, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword to kill themselves in the denouement? What happened to Sky? Did he die too? I was not quite clear on that. In any case, these four warriors are shown to be above and beyond all the others. If they live, they will at least be able to transmit the priceless knowledge to others. If it is not their personal right to openly support the king's endeavor, let them 'retire' and disappear. What is the reason for them to 'sacrifice' themselves? I can only think of one: contrivance. It makes the movie tragic. But it also makes the movie contrived.For 80-85 minutes, the director Yimou Zhang gives us a wonderfully meditative and artistically breathtaking movie. But in the last 10-15 minutes, he seriously missteps. The movie, as a whole, is good but falls short of the greatness it could have achieved.",7,0,1,14 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Better than I thought after the first viewing, though that doesn't say a whole lot!
","The most disappointing of the first four movies for a number of reasons, GoF is a good movie though significantly different from the books. I wouldn't be bothered too much by the differences with the book, but it is important to recognize that there are some crucial aspects to the story that one can't change or ignore. In any story of the genres associated with this story (coming of age and fantasy), until the end of the story, the young and growing hero learns from a mentor who is the intellectual fulcrum of the story just as the hero is the emotional fulcrum. We experience the growth and the emotional upheaval of the story with the hero but are comforted (just as the hero is) in the guidance of his/her mentor. This setup allows the focus to dwell on learning about the world the hero inhabits and the various tools needed to survive in that world. The mentor represents the storehouse of all knowledge about the world that we enter, inhabit and learn about (along with the hero). Thus the mentor also represents a sense of stability of the world. Only when the hero is 'ready' is this stability removed and this is done usually by the loss of mentor or loss of contact with the mentor. For those who are not into fantasy and/or coming of age genres, consider the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings. (LoTR messed it up a bit as well, especially in the 3rd movie, but nothing so major.) The most disappointing feature of GoF was that both the emotional and the intellectual fulcrums are muddled. This results chiefly from the characterization of Dumbledore. Gambon gets the lion's share of the blame. Kloves and Newell are also to blame, Newell in particular for not restraining Gambon at all. It looks like they were all cheering for Dumbledore to lose all his marbles. Dumbledore in this movie is haunted, confused, scared, lost and so on - all that Harry is supposed to be! So, all sorts of dynamics in the movie are misplaced and there's a sense of chaos. May be they wanted to convey chaos, but we are supposed to feel Harry's sense of chaos, not that the entire wizarding world is lost. That happens in the future. Besides, as long as Dumbledore is around, there ought to be hope. That's the general idea. Here it's confusion galore! This weakness is major, because it shows that the people behind the scenes possibly don't understand the genre as much. That does not bode well for the rest of the movies.The second biggest weakness of the movie is that everyone, including the death eaters started calling Voldemort by name! After establishing the You-Know-Who theme so heavily in the first three movies, hearing his name so often really undercut the terror he's supposed to project. Yeah, You-Know-Who is a really cheesy name, I'll grant that. But the whole point is that Voldemort's name shouldn't be used, except by a select few. If not, he becomes a regular-issue villain. Besides, who in the world imagined Ralph Fiennes' look? They really, really need to be fired. Voldemort is supposed to have RED eyes, no nose, is supposed to be bony like a clothed skeleton. Ralph Fiennes camped it up unrestrainedly (much like Gambon did) and that severely undercut the power of the movie. Frankly, I wouldn't have minded Voldemort being computer generated with motion capture (like a cross of Sauron's look and Gollum's filming technique in LoTR). Having an identifiable actor, however much his face was distorted, provided a human quality to Voldemort, significantly reducing his menace. Once again, fantasy villains are supposed to be really, really creepy. Why is Darth Vader, Sauron and every other fantasy villain cloaked and hidden? Revealing who they are makes them pedestrian. Once again, this doesn't bode very well for the rest of the series.Other than that, I'll not complain too much. Special effects are fairly brilliant, though the changes made from the book were not all good or even necessary. Performances, except that of Michael Gambon, are good. Quidditch world cup was a sore tease. They could've shown two minutes of the game! I always imagined a certain class to death eaters. Mostly, they looked like amateurs. The first task with the dragon was done well. The third task was mostly disaster for anyone who has read the book, but those who haven't won't feel much of a loss. The movie looks fabulous, score's good and overall it's a good entry. Just much, much short of the greatness the book is. So far GoF is the second best book in the series for me (closely behind OotP). This movie is the worst of the adaptations. That summarizes it all.",7,0,1,20 February 2007
