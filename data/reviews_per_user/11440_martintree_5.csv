10 Cloverfield Lane," Tense and claustrophobic thriller
",No spoilers in this review as this is really a film you should see without knowing much about. All you need to know is that its a tense and claustrophobic thriller featuring powerful performances that will grip you until the end. We are put in with three characters and watch as they deal with the situation they've been put in however it really feels like you're with them. All three are well developed and acted and help elevate this already great film. If you didn't like Cloverfield then you can still enjoy this film as the two are very different beasts and this one at least is less gimmicky and probably more accessible. Overall I'd recommend it to anyone that loves slow burn suspense and wants something a little bit different to other films out there.,10,0,0,8 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Mediocre
","Its better than Batman vs Superman but still isn't a good movie. The premise is simple however the film constantly feels as if it has to remind us that these are the bad guys and that's not good. The overall plot is a bit of a mess and the third act is awful however there is good to be taken from it. Will Smith and Margot Robbie do great in their roles, Robbie especially however surprisingly its Jai Courtney who steals the show as Captain Boomerang. Jared Leto makes an interesting Joker but is no patch on Heath Ledger and doesn't get nearly enough screen time. The action is good if a bit unmemorable and the soundtrack is alright. For a movie about bad guys though the main villain 'Enchantress' is truly terrible. Its a shame as I feel the rumored re-shoots really hurt this film. A more darker film with more character development would of been much nicer as there was potential here for a cult classic.",5,1,1,5 January 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Best MCU movie to date
",After seeing this for the first time in the cinema I was speechless. This really is the best MCU movie to date and shows you just how far the MCU has come. The main reason this film worked is because the characters in this universe have lots of history going back to Iron Man and Captain America: The first avenger. This makes there be so much more weight to their actions. All the actors are on top form especially Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. Special mentions go to Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man who slot in effortlessly and take turns completely stealing the show. The villain Helmut Zemo was also great and much more human than we're used to for villains. His story about how his family died is heartbreaking and I'm intrigued for what he does next. The standout scene has to be the airport scene featuring the debut of Giant Man which will go down in marvel legend. Simply put this is an amazing film with great action and many impressive character arcs. Bring on Infinity War.,10,1,4,5 January 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Surprisingly great
",Seeing a lot of reviews for this film I really wasn't expecting much however this film is surprisingly great. Being a fan of the x-men films in general I found this to be one of the best due to the way the ensemble was used. It was great to see James McAvoy again and Michael Fassbender put in an excellent performance especially when his family are killed bringing him into the fray once again. The newcomers were great as well with Tye Sheridan's Cyclops and Kodi Smit Mcphees Nightcrawler as stand-outs. Apocalypse himself was a good villain however I wish he'd been given a bit more to do and I didn't find his design all that great. Standout scenes would be the slow-mo Quicksilver sequence and the weapon X cameo. Overall this is a great chapter in the X-men saga and should not be overlooked.,9,5,7,5 January 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dull and boring
","I enjoyed Man of Steel however felt cautious about this film and rightly so. This film is not compelling in the slightest and any hope I had early on about this film quickly evaporated. It is dull and boring and seemingly takes forever to get going only to disappoint with the titular smack down and then chug along to a laughable climax against the cave troll from lord of the rings. Ben Affleck is great as Bruce but his Batman is way to violent and miles away from the character I've grown to love. Henry Cavill gets nothing to do except brood and make constipated faces and poor Amy Adams is saddled with a subplot that I honestly struggled to care about in an attempt to make her character relevant. Gal Gadot however is great as Wonder Woman but has no reason to be there except to set up Justice League. In fact, that seems to be the only thing the film wants to do which causes the story to suffer. Its a shame as they also wasted Doomsday and the death of Superman which would have been amazing if it was saved for a solo movie.",3,1,6,5 January 2017
