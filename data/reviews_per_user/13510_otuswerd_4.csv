Casablanca," Another timeless classic???
","...what does that mean? A timeless classic. I am told that there are many of them out there in the world of film, and of course, this is all based upon opinion. I saw Casablanca many years ago before seeing the many films I have today, and it was OK. It made me think of Indiana Jones if he settled down and ran a club, but only because the film is based during the same era. Now that I have recently watched it again after multiple viewings of..let's say...Fanny and Alexanrda, Citizen Kane, The 400 Blows, Beauty and the Beast (1946), and even Gone With the Wind, I still don't get why this film is ranked higher than these other films by people.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater of it, but I just think it's a bore, and that is my opinion. Humphrey Bogart has never really done anything for me, not even with the countless viewings of The African Queen I had to sit through every time they had it on TV while growing up. I feel that because of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman being in it automatically gives people the right to dub it a 'timeless classic'. When I think of a what that means, 'timeless classic', I think of the re-play value that the film has. Of course the acting is good, and the cinematographry is wonderful, it's the mood and tone of the film that brings me down.So if you have not seen this, please do have a watch. You might fall in love with it and you might not. I'm sure I will see it again someday down the road, and maybe my attitude on it will have changed.",5,5,10,27 October 2009
Citizen Kane," As you have heard before...One of the greatest films ever made....
","..in my book, and I have a big book of films. I first saw Kane in the mid 90's and had already acquired a distinct taste in films. The Cohen Brothers, Taratino, Lee, Lynch, these were my favorite directors in the early 90's, and WHAMMM, here comes Welles.This film gave me goosebumps within the first few minutes. The cinematography is by far some of the best I have ever seen, and the suspense leading up to one single word is amazing. The way the story is told is delightful, and Welles just steals the show. There are so many camera tricks in this film I had seen before though, and it was all in the films by the directors I have just mentioned. One of my favorite things Welles does with the film is how he took out floors to film different angles of himself to look powerful, while most other people in the film are shot from above to seem lower than him. I never realized the influence this film had on other filmmakers, and still see it today in several films.I can only imagine the excitement and buzz around it when it first came out. It was good for me going into the film knowing of the Hearst family and the true basis behind the films characters. Get this film, make some popcorn, and sit back and enjoy the amazing Citizen Kane... Rosebud.",10,8,12,27 October 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Songs of the south.....
","I just watched this for the second time, the first being many years ago, and I enjoyed it much more now that I'm older. Knowing the history of the time period this film takes place, it is interesting to watch it from the Southern view. This film was made only about 50 years after the Civil War, and because of that, for me, it holds more of a truth about the war that we might not see today in cinema. The story was enjoyable, yet very negative at times. It was interesting seeing the role of President Lincoln portrayed during the war, especially his assassination. The storyline of the brothers, and their family, was easy to relate to after knowing family members who have children serving overseas today in the military. The cinematography and imagery is bold and powerful for the time it was made. I can only imagine the controversy this film caused in the North when it came out. I read that their was a sequel made by a different director called The Fall of a Nation. It is now considered to be a lost film from what I read on Wikipedia. Too bad, I would have enjoyed seeing it.",8,1,5,13 October 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Being the adventures of an idiot in the war room...
","Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room......is one of my favorite lines from this film. And there are many great other lines in it as well. I have seen Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb many times over the past years and it never gets old or: I have seen every Kubrick film many times over the past years and they never get old.I feel that his films all go together, with his amazing style of film making, they all seem very similar. In Dr. Strangelove, he seems to really focus on the fact that it is in black and white. Setting up the lights just right to cause amazingly intense shadows. The way the light and dark is used against the actors faces, simply beautiful.The fact that this is the only comedy he made is fitting. Who wants another drab dry drama about the cold war? Not Stanley, and he did it just right, mixing black comedy with the days global issues..how else could you get away with it.I know I will be seeing this again over the years and will always look forward to it. Too bad Stanley is not with us any more, but for the films we have of his, he is with us every day.",10,1,2,9 December 2009
