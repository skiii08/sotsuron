The Blair Witch Project," Most Frightening Movie Ever Seen
","I went into this movie 'knowing what to expect'.  I had seen the reviews, I had memorized the website, I thought I was prepared.  WRONG.  Some of the images and sounds still give me the worst chills I've ever experienced. Nothing I could have done would have prepared me for what I saw.This movie was brilliantly done, doing exactly what it meant to, which was scaring the bejeezus out of every single person in the theater in Houston. It did it possibly too well.  I think it may have gone beyond the line of 'fun scary' to 'I- don't-know-if-I-can-handle-this scary'.I highly recommend this film, but I give a VERY SERIOUS warning.  If you're not really into horror, or don't like being scared, you probably ought to let someone else go for you.  Your pants will be wet and you won't sleep, otherwise.",9,1,2,17 July 1999
