The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Donnie Darko meets the Breakfast Club
","Throughout the film I wasn't quite sure what to expect.I liked the music and atmosphere of the film but there seemed to be something not quite right, something that made me uneasy and put me on edge.Ultimately, it's a great film, great performances, direction, technicals etc...Well, that's my opinion anyway - If you don't think Donnie Darko or The Breakfast Club were good films then don't go to see this movie.I was stuck to my seat at the end so watched all the credits - mainly to find out who wrote the 'score' but being Irish myself, i was amazed at how many Irish names were in the credits. Well done us!",8,0,2,5 January 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Wow, Tarantino goes from Hero to zero
","I'm not a film buff but I do watch films regularly and I have greatly enjoyed all of Tarantinos films to date.This film only succeeds on one level - cinematography. It fails on every other level - script, costume, storyline etc... The editing stood out as being particularly bad.The whole film lacked pace and direction which was unexpected as that is pretty much what Tarantino is know for and to date did it well.The last scenes with Brad Pitt beside the bloke from 'the office' well, I just had to remind myself that Brad Pitt wasn't being paid over 10 million to do this film and the bloke standing beside him was probably doing it for free.I also didn't quite get the NAZI Jewish thing.Everyone knows that Hitler killed millions of Jews, Poles, Gypsies, Invalids, Catholics, Communists, old people etc ... Less than Stalin though. Perhaps one of the new Russian billionaires will finance a film about stalin? And it is still true, as in the film, that Jewish people run the movie making industry in America so where is the irony? So for Tatantino as an American film director it wasn't exactly pushing the envelope to make a film about jews getting revenge on Hitler.It isn't an awful film, it's just well, not a good film and borders on being a bad film.",4,50,86,25 November 2009
