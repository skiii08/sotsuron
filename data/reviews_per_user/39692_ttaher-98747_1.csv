","The movie was about growing up. This movie was about a teenager boy who went through emotional trauma. It was about his freshman year. The decisions he made. It was all about what he went through the fun moments and the moments he felt alone. This movie was all about what he through with his friend, family and the person he loved.The main characters were Charlie, Charlie's sister, Patrick, Sam, Aunt Helen, Mary Elizabeth. The is about Charlie where all these people are mostly included. I liked the characters. They were amazing. They played their role really nicely.I have a lot of favorite part in the movie. The one that I mostly liked was when they went through the tunnel and Charlie said he felt 'infinite'.I liked the book and the movie. I liked the book a little more because it had a lot of information and details. Also it had the time where the events took place. I also liked the movie because there were some parts I didn't understand but after watching the movie I understood. I liked both.I would give 4 because there were some things I didn't like. I didn't like some parts of the movie and also the book. For that, I give the movie 4 on a scale of 5.",9,1,2,1 April 2017
