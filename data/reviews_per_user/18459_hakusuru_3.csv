Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't Believe the Hype
","Hmmm, where to start...Ali G - was a great character, loved the TV shows as well as the film.Borat - loved the TV shows, more so than Ali G and was really looking forward to the film, particularly seen as pretty much everyone I spoke to about it loved it.Am i missing something here? Is it really that good? Its humorous but Sacha Baron Cohen seems all to willing in this film to try and be too outrageous. The TV shows were great and I was a big fan but I found this repetitive and cringe-worthy. Admittedly, there were humorous parts, particularly the Kazakhi national anthem and the way the DVD is presented as a pirated disc was a nice touch.Overall, I found it very disappointing. Its not a bad film but it really isn't that good...Perhaps if I hadn't previously seen the TV shows I may have found it to be something more fresh and may have enjoyed it more.",6,1,4,9 March 2007
300," Hype strikes again
","It seems that any film with the correct mix of marketing and media hype can be a great box office success. In truth, congratulations are in order, as a lot of money has been made through a very average film that has been well sold.Taken in by the hype and seemingly good reviews, I was eager to see what this film had to offer, it also boasts a fairly high average rating.The film starts in a reasonable manor and the plot begins to develop nicely. At the half way point, I was thinking that this has the potential to be a good film and that was what I was expecting.However, it is at this point at which we are first introduced to the mongaloid brigade; they are both numerous in quantity and humorous in appearance. Firstly, we see a Quasimodoesque spartan who has been unfortunate enough to develop a tumour of some sort as if he is giving a piggy-back to a walrus. Not happy with hunch-backed hump-backs, we are then introduced to a pig-man that had cunningly been able to morph his hands into samurai swords. However, this character only features in the film at one, seemingly irrelevant point. What were they thinking? - 'Lets give a pig man with machetes for arms a cameo role in this blockbuster.' There were other appearances but I won't go into detail. This, for me, took away all credibility from the film as it made it fairly ridiculous and as I heard one person mutter in the cinema, 'pathetic'.**Spoilers Ahead** One of the main aims of the Spartans was to eliminate the Persian leader who fancied himself as a god, however, after watching this film for two hours, he doesn't get killed. What was the point of the whole film then???! It was clear, they were not going to win the whole war there and then or within the span of the film but because they failed to kill this enemy the whole film seems somewhat pointless.**Spoilers Over** The film had some good points, there were some good parts of dialogue and the action sequences were very good. However, the latter became very repetitive by the end of the film and the former could be often described as tedious. The special effects were well done which was good but this alone cannot make a film.Overall, its not an entirely bad film, it has its moments, however, it does not live up to the expectations assumed by the hype and the lacklustre ending and unrealistic nature is very disappointing.",5,4,11,30 March 2007
Jackie Brown," Very Watchable, A Different Shade of Tarantino
","When I think of Tarantino's films, I think of strong gory violence, non-chronological order and very showy films. They tend to be very action dominant; Jackie Brown, however, is rather different.It still has killing but they are toned down. We do not see limbs being removed with samurai swords, blood spouting from every orifice or brain matter splattered all over a car.The film itself flows very well and has a good plot. I did however find it a little predictable at times but it was still an entertaining watch. The casting was good and managed to fit their characters very well.In summary, if you have seen pulp fiction et al and are expecting much of the same then think again, you will find probably find this film very bland. However, this film does provide an entertaining watch with a gripping story and is certainly not bad.",7,1,2,21 March 2007
