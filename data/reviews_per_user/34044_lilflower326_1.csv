Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why is it hated so much?!?!
","I love this movie,its the my fourth favorite Star wars,my least favorite star wars is The Empire Strikes back.but,anyway I have to get back to my review,this movie had some boring parts in it,but had the best of all the star wars lightsaber duels,The final duel Between Qui-Gon Obi-Wan+Darth MAul,the dramatic music also made it the best.Many people I know liked the Yoda+Dooku duel the best thats my second 9/10",9,1,2,16 July 2002
