Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Moves & Counter Moves
","This may be better then the first. It is for me, and that's because the movie is a complex chess match. Moriarty is equally as brilliant as Sherlock and really makes you believe he is his equal. The class that is extended between each other makes the final clash seem so much more important. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies!",9,1,2,3 September 2019
Passengers," Amazing Idea
","This part is spoiler free:This is by far one of my favorite movies as far as concept goes. A really awesome idea brought to screen in a calculated and fun way. I'm a huge fan of Chris Pratt & Jennifer Lawrence, and them together is beautiful. Jim is a likable character with a lot of knowledge. Arora is an interesting and beautiful character. An unlikely love story in the most complex of situations. Don't listen to people saying this movie is terrible, I have a hard time understanding why. This is worth a watch, and you'll watch it more then once.SPOILERS:I'm sure I'm not the only person who would enjoy a second movie highlighting all the ups and downs of their life together alone on the Avalon. I would love to see it, even though it will never get made. But I can hope.",9,1,1,5 September 2019
Ready Player One," This didn't win an Oscar?!?!?
","This movie SHOULD and in my household will be an instant classic! The fact that this didn't win an Oscar, at the very least Best Achievement in Special Effects is appalling. One of the most visually impressive movies I have ever seen. This movie didn't get the credit it deserved! 10/10, 5 stars, highly recommend!",10,1,3,28 March 2019
Suicide Squad," Why so Negative?
","This movie has some really awful reviews and a very disrespectful IMDb star count, which is completely unjustified. First off, Margot Robbie and Will Smith were the PERFECT choice for their respective roles. Secondly, the story and plot are better then reviews would suggest. Now I do believe that Tom Hardy would have made a better Rick Flag, but you can't have the cake and eat it too. Viola Davis is also perfectly cast as well, then that brings me to that Joker. I was truly disappointed in the joker....having limited screen time. From what was shown, it was different and edgy, don't compare to previous jokers, you'll be disappointed. Overall, if you enjoy the DC universe you will love this movie. If you like a movie with a badass assassin and a strong female lead, you will love this movie. Enjoy!",8,1,1,4 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Beautiful
","A beautiful ending to a legendary story. No spoilers from me, a must watch. 100,000,000/10",10,67,121,28 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Outstanding Picture, slow build
","A visually captivating movie by Tarantino. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio played their characters to perfection and will most likely get oscars for their efforts. Trailers paint this movie to make it seem Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is a main character, which is not the case, so don't go in thinking it's mainly about Manson, because you'll be disappointed. The last 20 minutes or so is classic Tarantino. Brad Pitt is hilarious and it's just fun to see him in this role. A very well done drama, just remember one thing, this movie is mainly a DRAMA. Not a normal Tarantino action movie, he focuses more on bringing back the narrative of what a movie is supposed to be, instead of some of the lousy pictures we get today. 10/10 for #9. Can't wait for #10, his official bow. It's going to be a classic.",10,39,57,27 July 2019
Aladdin," Fun family movie
","At first I had no interest in seeing this movie. But after watching Will Smith introducing Prince Ali in a clip that I saw on YouTube, I decided that it would be worth seeing. The movie comes to life when Will Smith's genie hits the screen. He's outrageously funny, and honestly kills this role. DO NOT try to compare to the late Robins William's genie, as they are not remotely the same, and that's the beauty of it. Will makes it his own, and honestly made this movie so much better. The actors picked for the main roles are perfect, and the overall acting was surprisingly good. The only reason this movie gets an 8 from me is I wish that Will would have had a bit more screen time, but that's just my opinion. The special effects are amazing and really well done. Robin Williams would be very proud of what this cast accomplished.",8,0,2,29 May 2019
It Chapter Two," Block out the noise
","Listen, you have to like the story of IT to like this movie. The same with the first, because it's out there. If your familiar with the story, you will be familiar with how this movie plays out. I was however surprised to see some really terrible CGI at times considering the high budget, but most of the CGI is fine, possibly too much CGI. Bill Hader steals this movie for me, as a fan of his comedic performances I was skeptical he could pull this off, but he did 10 times over. Brilliantly cast, and brilliantly executed. People who are complaining that this wasn't scary enough needs to notice this movie on IMDB is listed 'Drama, Fantasy, Horror' in that order. Which means it's not your average horror movie, just has jump scares and a spooky plot. All in all this is a good follow up. I enjoyed the first one more as a whole, but I enjoyed the actors in the Chapter 2 equally as much. Enjoy.",8,2,2,12 September 2019
Sherlock Holmes," Moves & Counter Moves
","This was a really well done movie. I absolutely love RDJ as Sherlock, In my opinion he was the perfect choice for the role. His chemistry with Jude Law is obvious, and the movie is much better because of it. If you enjoy a great movie of moves and counter moves, this ones perfect for you.",9,1,1,3 September 2019
