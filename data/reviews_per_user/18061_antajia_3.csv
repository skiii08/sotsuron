Hereditary," I like it but it could have been more.
","In the first half of the movie it seems more like a deep family drama with some creepy aspects. It played on emotion and drama so well and actually made the characters worth investing in so that when the terrible things happen it's that more impactful and shocking (which is something that usually gets left behind in horror, which is so refreshing). As the movie draws closer to the end though, that mood seems to get completely thrown out the window in favor of the typical horror cliches. The end feels hastily thrown together leaving one confused and unsatisfied when the movie ends. The story had these great characters but just didn't seem to know what to do with them or where it was even going. It was incredibly frustrating for how emotionally involved I was for these characters to not have any closure but even without closure it has made a lasting impression on me.",8,10,18,22 August 2018
Knives Out," Eye Rolling
",Wow what a complicated plot for what really amounts to 'white people are the devil and brown people are literal angels sent from heaven.',2,8,17,9 February 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Not impressed
","Felt like it had the same problems as Captain America: Civil War. Just too much crammed together under an overly complicated plot. No one character or event was able to get enough screen time to make much of a lasting impression, there never felt any sense of urgency to the fact that Thanos was gonna kill half the universe off, it the sequence of the scenes was disorganized. Thanos was a very interesting character and the movie should have been told more from his perspective so we could learn more about him and give the movie more organization.",4,2,3,4 August 2018
