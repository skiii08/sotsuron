The Avengers," If you are interested at all you will like it
","I went into this movie with an assumption. I figured that the action scenes would be awesome. Marvel had shown that they were very capable of great action sequences and this would be no exception.However, action alone doesn't make a good movie (matrix sequels). This was the part that I was worried about. Would the story and characters be good enough to match the explosive action? The answer is a resounding YES! Great character interactions, hilarious dialog, a true comic book story (not deep like Dark Knight but fun like Iron Man). All of the characters have roles that feel natural and the dialog flows. Robert Downey Jr getting Joss Whedon lines is as good as it sounds and I never realized how hilariously awesome the hulk could be.There are a few problems I had with the movie such as Captain America's back story, no wait I really just hated the Captain America movie. This movie met my expectations (which were enormously high so to surpass them this would have had to be the second coming of Christ's type of awesome).",10,7,15,7 May 2012
Man of Steel," Zach Snyder Understands Comics
","The Man of Steel is back in this reboot. Going into it I was excited to see what Snyder could do with Superman, after all 300 and Watchmen were great and even Suckerpunch was decent considering who the lead was.Snyder showed he knows how to film great action. Despite the characters moving at insane speeds, he still lets the audience see what is happening (unlike transformers) and man is it fun. The fights are fun and exciting and everyone should watch the movie for them if nothing else.The three leads are excellent as well. Superman, of course, does a good job of exploring the internal conflict that so often plagues superheroes. What is the right thing to do with all this power? Lois is an intelligent investigative reporter who brings a more proactive roll to the character. Finally Zod is a wonderful villain, showing depth of character as well as forcing the viewer to feel some empathy for him. You can't quite bring yourself to hate him, even if you do know he needs to be stopped.Now for the problems. Side characters should be just that, side characters. The story does not need to bend over backwards to give Perry White moments of glory. In addition there were several scenes that appeared to try to follow Nolan's example of having characters do wildly idiotic things in order to let the plot get to where it needed to.Finally, there were a few scenes that tried to seem more over the top in order to deliver more drama which actually diminished the overall effect. What should have been the most moving scene in the movie, for instance, was laughable rather than heartfelt because the writers apparently forgot how to make a good script momentarily.I thought it was well worth a watch. It is comparable to Batman Begins in that some people will love it but the rest of us won't particularly care unless the follow up can really blow us away. It was disappointing how much potential the script had yet the writers seemed to get lazy a little too often which took away from the overall experience.It was enjoyable but it was no Avengers and certainly was no Dark Knight.",7,0,1,16 June 2013
Avatar," Eye candy but nothing else
","I give the 3 out of 10 for visuals. Nothing else. I've seen it twice and the first time I was completely taken away by the visuals. James Cameron surpasses anything ever done (with the exception of maybe some Japanese videos like the Final Fantasy 7 advent Children movie).However, that's as far as I can go with being positive about the movie. Sure the actors were good and believable but the characters weren't. Usually when someone tries to make a story out of something completely overdone they at least try for some originality (this is a Pocahontas story). Even the Disney version had characters who weren't complete stereotypes. Avatar makes no attempt to be original. Cameron flaunts the fact that his only selling point is the effects. I felt it was an insult to cinema that this movie was even considered for best movie.On my second viewing of this I was bored. The shock and awe of the effects were gone and without them, this is a terrible piece of cinema. I do think people should watch this movie, if for no other reason than to get excited about what will happen when these visuals are actually matched by a good director and good story but don't go out of your way to see it.",3,3,5,14 October 2011
