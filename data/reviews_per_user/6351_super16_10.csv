Lucky Number Slevin," King of the Middle of the Road
","This movies features some good performances, some serious over-acting and, by a few, some poor performances. It suffers from some unbelievable plot points (the neighbor of a randomly selected person who just happens to owe money to both mob bosses, is used to coming over to his place without knocking, works in the morgue, knows the main detective, has a friend at Good Kat's hotel AND gets the second lead to fall in love with her in just a few days? -- just not plausible, particularly given the 'this feels really pasted on at the last minute happy ending' with Lui and Hartnett's characters.The movie also works too hard to copy way too many films without really finding its own grove and style. It had enough elements to make a decent movie but apparently the filmmakers don't have the courage of some of their own character's convictions.",4,9,19,25 May 2008
Star Trek," Good Popcorn Entertainment
","This is a very well made and sufficiently well-conceived film that it is disappointing that its downfalls (which only come to you in retrospect) are actually as large as they are. It's a very enjoyable film - most casual moviegoers will come in and leave feeling like their money was spent well. However, anyone who wants a well rounded film experience, including a great plot, won't necessarily feel that way. And while many of the hard core fans will accept the (SPOILERS start here) alternate reality/time traveling story line, the writers took a very easy way out with these plot devices - it is something which has been done in any number of sci-fi franchise (perhaps with the lone exception of the Star Wars movies) from Star Gate to Star Trek, the plot reminded me of a combination of several episodes of Voyager ('Relativity' and, more particularly, 'Year of Hell'). The other problem with the movie is the choices they made, both involving the same character - the destruction of his home world and his relationship with a fellow crew member. Another complaint I have with the movie is some of the cast. While good actors, Cho and Seldana do nothing with their parts as Sulu and Uhura. On the other hand, Urban is very good as McCoy and Quinto is an adequate (albeit more illogical than necessary) Spock, but both Pegg's very brief, late entry as Mr. Scott and particularly Anton Yelchin excellent Chekov. Pine does a very good job of making a very well known pop icon his own. On the other hand, one of the essentially problems with the film is why Kirk gets the full on hero worship at the end when it was Chekov and Scott who made the success of the trip possible and Spock himself who saved Planet Earth. Another failure in the script is that Uhura and Sulu really had nothing (and did nothing) to contribute. It's also a very charming, witty script although someone who is only a casual audience member or even a sometime fan will not get some of the in-jokes. The high grade is for the fact that the movie is a very good form of entertainment and hopefully some of these issues will be resolved in the already planned sequels. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt in the hopes they will try harder in the plot.",6,2,10,7 May 2009
Superbad," Crass, distasteful, and just plain terrible
","There was a certain underlying sweetness to films like There's Something About Mary and The 40 Year Old Virgin, in spite of the fact that both movies (far more so the Aptow film) has some very crass elements to them. While not ideal, some of these elements can be viewed as necessary to the story line or the ultimate resolution of either of those films.However, Superbad is just simply and plainly a terrible film - with very little genuine humor to redeem it. The crass elements of Superbad and far from necessary as their is no genuine story line other than to parrot teen comedies of the last decade: one or more boys try to get some booze, try to get some babes, and try to get 'some.' While those issues may have been 'ultimately resolved' in Superbad, there is no genuine resolution there. The characters have not learned anything, they are no better nor worse off than before and the audience certainly hasn't learned anything -- except perhaps that the target audience of teen males who most want to see movies in the first two weekends when the studios can make their most money from the receipts -- still rule what films will and will not get made.A silent Charlie Chaplin film still has the power to make us laugh some fifty years after it was made. In fifty years, people will likely wonder how something as crass and distasteful as this was considered one of the 'better' comedies of the year.",1,23,97,23 August 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Charming Fun - Don't Expect More
","The Ocean's film have always been about harmless but charming and glamorous fun, with some excellent acting, funny dialogue, crisp set ups and great behind the camera work on multiple levels by the crafts people on the films. Their weakest links have always been the scripts, which were always good on the funny bits and what created the bonds between the actors. However, with this third version was the script. The drill bit part, the Mexican labor camp revolution, the threat which forces the need for the revenge which is the basis of the film, etc.I actually liked the second film more than this one, the big problem I had with it was that Catherine Zeta Jones just got too far too fast into Rusty's caper (and purely to advance the plot of that movie) and the entire Julia Robert's pregnancy bit. This one has no major flaws like that one, just a collection of minor ones.However, it's still fun and enjoyable and if you don't mind not straining yourself at all, you should be able to enjoy it. Recommended as a matinée or a rental.",6,0,1,15 July 2007
Disturbia," Proficient Entertainment
","Disturbia is an interesting film, most definitely based, as others have commented, on the very superior Hitchcock film, Rear Window, which is highly recommended.What distinguishes this film from other remakes is an excellent lead performance by LaBeouf (as Kale) and good support from the generally excellent David Morse as the villain (written as Mr. Turner in the script) as well as Aaron Yoo, in the 'best friend' comic relief role. Unfortunately, Carrie Ann Moss is underused. The movie is ruined by the last section. Rather than the apparently methodical and reasoned rationale for his character that we have viewed so far, Turner (Morse's character) becomes reckless and openly homicidal, going after a cop, and the entire set of neighbors (without any thought given to the ramifications of these acts  for example, that there would be a police incident report, with the same self officer involved, listing his name and address on the report). This same section is ruined by the overly elaborate secret room, within a secret room, with a basement literally flooded with dead bodies (as if Turner has been carting them around from all his previous crime scenes). It particularly is annoying because the bodies in the water scene look very intact, which would apparently diminish the need for the surgical room (other than the fact that all of this probably provides the audience with a good fright). All of this exposition and character development is highly reckless and not in character with the way Turner is represented, both in his earlier crime spree, where he apparently eluded the authorities undetected, and with the way Morse portrayed Turner at the hardware store, with Kale's mother at the grocery store, and with the earlier police incident and the deer.Finally, no explanation is given for either the cause or the actual two instances of priors that lead to the slugging of the Spanish teacher to be a third. In fact, the only real need for this in the script is to justify the entire set-up: the death of the father leads to the punch = house arrest, because of the two unexplained priors. Kale is otherwise a very normal, albeit bright and perhaps unchallenged teenager, not some gang member or somehow economically disadvantaged youth who-must-steal, or misunderstood young man who-must-fight. As with Turner's ability early on to be at the wrong place at the right time (in the world's largest parking garage to a very small looking hardware store and at the grocery store to meet Kale's mother), these plot points exist because the screen writers couldn't find a way to otherwise explain something needed to move the story forward.This is a very polished, largely well-acted and well made movie, that might have gotten a higher rating with more imagination and plotting in the script, as well as some direction to take into account these elements and attempt to minimize them.",6,0,0,24 August 2007
The Incredibles," Simply Incredible
","I saw this movie in theaters, and recently, after seeing Ratatouille in theaters, watched the entire movie on the DVD again from start to finish. When the DVD was first on sale, I bought it simply because I knew I'd eventually want to see it again, but other than the special and bonus features (including Just Jack Attack), did not view the movie since its 2004 theatrical release.Seeing the movie again, and comparing it to the number of excellent movies that came before and after it, I once again feel it was simply one of the very best films - plot wise, composition and technical production value wise, and as far as the voice talent and, of course, the script. And I don't mean this as one of the very best children's film or the very best animation films. I mean, simply put, it easily is among my all time top ten amongst films in terms of overall quality, which includes for me production values, direction, art direction, acting and, primarily, script.It is also a film you can easily see over and over again and catch new and interesting details and quality marks not as easily discerned in previous viewings.",10,1,1,29 August 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," A Good Story and Promising Script Ruined by One Significantly Poor Choice
","This review is based on the DVD so I reference some of the bonus features. The story is an excellent one; while some seemed to feel it should have been more like The Truman Show or Adaptation, I enjoyed the fact the script took some chances, and did so in imaginative ways, while still moving the story forward which is, after all, what any good movie should accomplish. Many of the performances were very strong, particularly Thompson and Hoffman. What is unfortunate is that so many other talented people were, essentially, wasted in what sometimes were pointless cameo's (for example, Tom Hulce, Kristen Chenowith, and Linda Hunt). Queen Latifah (particularly) and Maggie Gyllenhaal's role could also have been played more appropriately by other actors; in Gyllenhaal's case, a different choice would have made the pairing work better. However, the really bad choice that really ruined the movie was the casting of Ferrell as the lead. While there is nothing intensely wrong with his performance, he is not a very good dramatic actor and does not have the range for this type of role. In the case of Hoffman and Thompson, you got to watch their performances and enjoy the characters without thinking about the acting. With Ferrell, it just felt like you were watching him read the dialogue - competently, at times, I would admit - but this is not a script that called for competence.When you see the disk and hear the main producer and director (and particularly the screen writer) fawn over Ferrell as the best choice and a good lead, you have to wonder whether this was a choice partially (if not wholly) forced upon by the studio or some of the money men, in the hopes of making the movie more commercial, but unfortunately, in had the effect of making a potentially interesting and really enjoyable movie into a mundane, if at least proficient one.",5,0,0,15 July 2007
Shooter," Clichéd but not without interest
","This is a fairly polished production; however, the script takes some very easy short-cuts or falls back on some very clichéd characters. The parts of Johnson (Glover), and all of the other bad guys are comically, characteristically 'bad' guys. Glover's role, in particular, ends up the moving towards a portrayal where he is tossing off purely two dimensional lines so bad they are laughable. Wahlberg's portrayal is fine, if limited to very few notes. As some other reviewers notes, Mara is essentially limited to some expressions of fear and anxiety. Pena is well used, although a fair portion of his role towards the end of the plot ends up in deleted scenes. The lack of credibility in some key points (A. that Wahlberg's role wouldn't ask for any kind of basic identification and would feel that it would be necessary for one man to do the wind and location scouting readings, versus telling any number of presumably other competent Army, FBI or other agency snipers to assist -- and, of course, confirm; B. that every other FBI officer, experienced officers, all, would question Pena's recollection. memory and interpretations -- with the KEY exception of one secretary; C. that a large, amorphous well- staffed and well-funded 'agency' could exist in the U.S. government overseen by only one lone senator from the great state of Montana) probably didn't ruin the movie for anyone who wanted a action piece, but it hurts the movie as both a suspense or thriller feature. The comparison by one television to the Bourne movie is totally off the mark. This movie lacks the intelligence of those plots, the acting, writing and stunt work, as well as the believability quotient of that series.",4,0,1,23 July 2008
Iron Man," Fine - Not Fantastic
","I'm not sure I would agree with the folks who give this an 8 or higher -- but then, my scores for movies are probably graded out on a higher bell curve than most folks seem to think exist. So, a 6 for me, means well above average. The acting in the movie is, for the most part, uniformly good, even the small roles. I would agree with some of the user reviews who said that some roles were very small and the actors were underused. In particular, Terrance Howard doesn't have much to do with his role - although I guess if they go the standard Hollywood sequel route, at some point Howard will get to top line a War Machine sequel. Paltrow, as Pepper Pots, however, strikes me as stunt casting pure and simple. This is a role that could have been handles by any number of other actresses and probably handled equally well, if not with more ease and grace. Some of the secondary roles, such as Leslie Bibbs were also way too minor not to be played by a decent character actor, and others, such as Jeff Bridges, simply were too rushed to reflect the arc that characters took from the start of the movie towards the end.This feature is your basic super hero origin movie - likely because the filmmakers must assume that most people (such as myself) would not be familiar with how Tony Stark became Iron Man. On that level, I think the movie worked really well. The story was plausible (although I feel more could have been done to explain both the Arc reactor technology and the actual medical issue of the shrapnel/heart danger).",6,3,6,25 May 2008
Click," Predictably Unamusing
","As some other users notes, this is a timeless story - that has been both beautifully and interesting presented, in movies like It's A Wonderful Life and in the story of Faust. However, why Adam Sandler's production company decided this needed to be updated and retold, is simply unknowable - because other than adding an unfunny crudeness (fart jokes, boob jokes, dogs humping a stuffed duck?), it did nothing that a recent, better made movie like Nicolas Cage's The Family Man did, while covering much of the same territory.What is also further implausible (and becomes even more so as Sandler ages and lets himself go) is that he would end up with the hot girl. In some of his other movies, there was some unknown charm or childlike wonder or other unearthed element to the roles he played to justify how he got the girl (say in Big Daddy or even Billy Madison), but in this he plays a unpleasant, unattractive, unappealing shlub. He might rate a decent girl - not Kate Beckinsale.Another problem with the script is how poorly thought out some parts are - why would the Angel of Death do something for a 'nice guy?' In this role, Walken was either the devil or god, but not the Angel of Death. Its elements like this that show how poorly thought out and poorly developed this concept was - once they decided to rip it off from better made movies.",2,0,1,25 May 2008
