Source Code," excellent! just what I needed after a long day
","I've just finished watching it and it really brought me to a different reality,I couldn't see anything else until it was over, it was that kind of a movie. great job to the actors & to the one who wrote that script! I would love to see more movies like this one, and I love the idea of parallel worlds where anything can happen, it makes you wonder.. The concept of the movie is quite new, never seen it in movies before and I think that's exactly what people are looking for - it enriches our imagination. To think beyond the limits and to believe that death is not the end - these are two of most important ideas from this movie (please excuse my English, still learning).",10,4,6,16 June 2011
