United 93," Is this an instructional video for more TERRORIST???
","I just saw the film...and first of all... I have to say its not a very well made film... mainly because I was taking away from the story by the poor sound sync... I don't know if anyone noticed but the sound did not sync up with the picture...please don't reply to hate on me...everyone is entitled to there opinions.Now..I don't know why this movie was made so soon...At least they should have waited till the war in Iraq was over...IF TERRORIST WHERE PLANNING TO HI-JACK ANOTHER PLANE...Don't YOU THINK, THEY WILL WATCH THIS FILM, AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG...AND WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER????? Maybe its just me.",Null,0,4,24 March 2007
Get Out," One of the Best Films I've seen in years
","This is not a film for White People. I say this because I sat in a theatre with a diverse group of people and noticed the white people in the audience seemed offended by the film. Even though I am black, I believe this film was very well done. The casting director did an amazing job with the cast, all the actors were very believable in their roles. This is truly a unique cinematic experience, I've spent a great deal of time watching films from different parts of the world and its rare for me to say that I've never seen a film like this before. This is one of those films that makes white people look bad, but to be fair it does a great job in capturing the experience of a black man surrounded by 'too many white people'. For instance, I've almost always been the only black person at my job, and I've had my boss ask me about certain rappers simply for the fact that I'm black. During the summer olympics, my boss literally asked me what it was like to see black people win gold medals for America. My boss is not a racist, but often makes ignorant comments just like this film depicts. Kudos to Jordan Peele!!! I hope to see more from him.",Null,47,108,21 February 2017
