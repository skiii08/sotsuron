Blade Runner 2049," A difficult plot nuanced with cinematography and scifi dystopia
",The plot seems to run its course with no specific discourse. Much of the plot and battle scenary seem to leave the viewer puzzled upon the implications on what is happening and why. Additionally much of the movie is centered on Agent K's terminator aspects to disregard what is seemingly common sense and willfully put himself into harm's way.,6,0,5,13 March 2019
