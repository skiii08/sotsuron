Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than the critics said
","After all the hype, anything less than steller would have been disappointing. But for the true Star Wars fan, Lucas' latest (or is it first?) installment in the Star Wars saga doesn't disappoint. People who try to review this movie outside the context of it's place in the bigger picture, just don't understand. The best surprise? It actually has a pretty good story to go along with all those special effects.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
