The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Yes I Did Actually Watch This Movie...
","I believe quite firmly that this movie was made for chicks to sit down and ooh, ahhh, and cry over, but I enjoyed it immensely. I was a freshman just like Charlie when I saw it, and it chronicles this suicidal kid's life quite nicely, showing that sometimes a group of kids is willing to take in a stray despite any age differences, and that sometimes a girl with a different guy that she's in love with is willing to help out a guy that has feelings for her.The movie also deals with gay romances and drugs as well as bullying. The director has handled these things very well, almost with a finesse.It's a chronicle of teen romance. I'd recommend it more for girls than guys, but see if you think you should.",9,0,1,7 May 2014
Zootopia," Runs Slightly Off Track
","Zootopia starts out as one of Disney's typical propaganda films, with the talent show trying to shove the message of all-inclusiveness down our throats. It also goes right for the message of you can be anything that you want to be, which is great, but again, propaganda filled and set towards Disney's liberal-leaning message.There are also tons of stereotypes made about the animals. A great example of this would be how the lions are just automatically predators or how bunnies are just cute and dumb.J.K. Simmons and Jason Bateman, as well as Idris Elba, do some fantastic acting that definitely makes their scenes worth a rewatch or three.There are times when the film gets lost in it's plot line too, like how the assistant mayor suddenly decides to be a villain or how there's a random chase with a panther during the movie.There are some funny parts though. The sloths at the DMV and the mafia boss mouse killed me.If you're trying to teach your kids something by showing them this movie, be ready to answer lots of questions at the end.",7,1,5,26 December 2016
Man of Steel," Worst Superman Reboot EVER
","When I heard that a reboot of Superman was coming out in 2012 that dropped the cast of the 2006 reboot, I thought that it was quite pointless to have only had those people for one film, so I wasn't looking forward to this.I watched this around Christmas 2013, and I wasn't impressed. The story runs over many years, and gives Clark Kent a new start, even showing his life on his planet before it gets destroyed. Then the story focuses in on issues Clark has because of his strength, and Clark is made to look stupid and unwanted because of these traits. These incidents make for sad scenes that pepper the middle of the movie.A boring climax puts the icing on the cake for this snooze feet of a Superman movie, with most of us racing for the exits at the end. Don't waste your time on this movie!",1,6,11,21 March 2014
Divergent," Fast-Paced From Start To Finish
","I expected this movie to be a boring teenage love story because I had never actually seen the previews. Boy was I wrong! The movie starts out kind of slow, but then picks up after the choosing ceremony, and keeps on going without stopping until what seems like a 45 minute long climax scene that makes you wonder how many levels it'll step up.I enjoy Jai Courtney's portrayal of Eric the Dauntless leader, and the Dauntless faction as a whole. If I was a bit more physically fit I could possibly be one of them. I also enjoy seeing Maggie Q getting a post Nikita role as big as that of Tori.I do have a few nitpicks though. I don't like how slitting your hand open is shown as being mandatory as it sends a bad message. Also, the relationship between Tris and Four seems to send the vibes that a student having a relationship with her teacher is perfectly OK.I also think another actor could've pulled off Jeanine better, like Jane Lynch or Kristen Wiig, maybe even Cameron Diaz. It just didn't seem like Kate Winslet was the right choice.If you're OK with having your kids witness a lot of physical and gun violence, go see this movie. You won't regret it one little bit.",8,0,2,19 April 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Ian McKellen Brings Flair To This Dull Storyline
","I am watching the three Hobbit movies before I see the three Lord Of The Rings movies, so this was my first time entering the world of Middle Earth that people love so much.Now of course, they're dividing the Hobbit book up into three movies, which can sometimes make for dull waiting periods to kill time, and there is a CRAPLOAD of time killing in this movie. Whether it's walking or riding to where the action takes place, or letting the viewer watch nothing as we wait for something to happen gets old and boring after a while.That being said, all the characters are believable, especially Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf The Great, who basically acts as a leader/babysitter of the dwarfs throughout the movie, always knowing where to go and many times saving everyone from danger. Gandalf is what makes the movie so interesting, as there are a lot of boring parts that pepper the rest of this 2.5 hour movie.See this movie and the two sequels before you see the three LOTR movies.",7,2,5,16 March 2014
Gone Girl," How To Create A Crazy Good Film
","Gone Girl takes a brand new concept and turns it into a movie that could easily bring home an Oscar. Imagine if your wife just randomly disappeared and was supposedly dead, yet she left enough evidence to pin the murder on you when she wasn't actually dead? That's what this film does, and also brings Tyler Perry into a more serious role as attorney Tanner Bolt, who brings suave and gravitas to his character. Neil Patrick Harris appears in something other than a comedy production and does a magnificent job. A lot of new technology can also be seen, especially in Collin's house, and it's magnificent. Gone Girl is a good movie, and it's a good watch for everybody.",9,2,11,19 October 2014
Frozen," Maybe A Little Too Much Hype
","Disney movies have kind of crashed and burned with old adult fans in recent years, bringing us films like Planes and Tangled. They have however, broken new ground, such as featuring an African-American Princess, and setting a Pixar film in Scotland. Some of the most recent Disney films don't focus on love, rather friendship, such as Brave. Frozen is a love story, but it has a few more elements added in, such as you can't trust everyone you meet, and that running away and hiding doesn't solve all of our problems. It also shows that truly nice people don't always finish last, as Kristoff goes from a lowly ice deliverer to the friend of Anna, and there's not really much more to it. They don't get married at the end of the story, which is a nice change of pace.I've heard from many that this film is groundbreaking, and it isn't. It just features a lot of charming characters and a different storyline from the Disney movies of 2005-2013. It could definitely be considered for the Classic Disney library in the future though.I'd say watch, but don't expect to agree with the critics claiming it's groundbreaking when it's over",6,3,7,24 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I Saw This For The First Time in 2009
","Believe it or not, I saw this movie at the age of 12, maybe a little older than most kids were when they saw it for the first time. I understood very little of what was going on because I hadn't seen the three prequels, which I made a mental note to watch after seeing this one.I like the movie because it's a great opening for the second three movies. It starts out with some great comedy from our two robot friends C-3PO (voiced wonderfully by Anthony Daniels), and R2-D2. After a little bit of this, we get to know Luke Skywalker, and the story truly takes off from there.I like how the plot clicks along at what I'd call a steady pace. We meet all of the characters in scenes that were set up quite amazingly, and it all leads up to the duel at the end, where Obi-Wan Kenobi meets his unfortunate end, which was the saddest part of the movie for me.One thing I love about this movie is Darth Vader's voice, provided quite magnificently by James Earl Jones. You can feel the tension when his voice is coming out through that mask.If you haven't even heard of Star Wars, I recommend you start here if you want to go in production order. However, if you want the entire story, start with Episode I.",8,1,1,13 March 2014
