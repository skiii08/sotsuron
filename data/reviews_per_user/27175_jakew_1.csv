The Blair Witch Project," The WORST Movie EVER!!!!
","This is the first time I have ever written a critique of any movie I have ever seen.  It irritated me enough to put my thoughts in writing. Regrettably, the Mrs. and I saw this  - refugee from a cats litter box - excuse for a movie.  At the end, a lady in the row behind us said: ` For this I paid $8.00?  I could have stayed home and seen much better on TV.' A young lad several rows down, shouted: `This movie SUCKS!'  We heard several other people say: `This movie stinks.'  My son saw this movie in New Jersey, and he told us that there was - at the end of the movie Â– a chorus of people shouting that they wanted their money back.  My own feelings were that it should have had a rating of PG, for Pure Garbage!  The whole movie was very illogical, dumb, poorly filmed, unbelievable, badly acted, dragged out, had overkill use of the `F' word, was not frightening at all, and had more plot holes than a sieve. I could go on here almost without end; casting well deserved aspersions on this `truly dreadful movie.'  Frankly, I felt like walking out of the theater half way through it.  It was so bad; I nearly lost my humanity for a moment, and was almost happy to see every one die a miserable death in the end.  This `Movie?' itself deserves euthanasia.  My wife says that `joee001's' summary of 9 August 1999 `What a piece of crap' says it all.  The real mystery to us is how over 5,000 people in your rating survey, found this `crap flick' worth any rating higher than a one?  In all fairness, please note that in the voting for this movie, most of the voting shows that the voters either loved or hated this flick.  In our opinion, if you haven't seen this movie yet, DON'T!  Do yourself a favor and save your time and money.",1,1,3,28 August 1999
