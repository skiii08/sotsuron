Vertigo," A surprise
","I thought it'll be another old American movie that is boring but the movie is done very well, won't call it a masterpiece (maybe for that time) but a solid movie. The characters are well developed and played, the Hero is doing a great job and the plot will leave you in suspense",8,0,1,25 December 2019
Get Out," good movie
","This isn't a real horror film & i say it in the most positive way. The movie is very well done, suspense is great, only problem is how weird the family is in the beginning- doesn't seem plausible enough. Otherwise great movie, solid play and good points about USA society in the present",8,0,4,23 January 2020
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Except making good films Ken Loach also creates propaganda
","I was really amazed after i saw this film that Ken Loach looked only thru the eyes of the Irish people without giving the British any way to respond. Tahs propaganda & an issue to arise all the hatred between the nations again. Now lets clear it up, i'm not saying that the British did something good & the Irish were terrorist but i do know that in EVERY war/conflict the bad aren't all that bad & the good aren't all that good. I do believe the the Irish people where doing right but not showing the other side is ignorant & juvenile. And in this film the Brithish constantly behaving like pigs & the director did made his point in the first couple of cases but Loach continues to show more & more of this stuff-& this what makes it a propaganda.So if you like to watch a mature film about war that actually tells whats happened here i'll recommend 'Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo' & i can assure you that if you'll see this movie first & then'll try to see 'the wind...' you'll understand the difference between a director & a propagandist! And yes the film is visually beautiful thats why he got the 5 stars( and ONLY for that)",5,6,12,28 October 2008
The Departed," this movie is looooooonnnngggggg
",Once there was a director who made very good movies and then i guess he ran out of ideas and instead just decided to do very long movies that keep going & going and doing little ripples here and there with some average twists but after 2 hours it's just damn too long!,7,0,1,25 December 2019
