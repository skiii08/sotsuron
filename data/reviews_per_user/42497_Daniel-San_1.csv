The Rock," One of the best action movies ever!
","All kind of action: car races, helicopters, air fighters, one-to-one combat, tactical combat, explosions.. etc etc.  The rock has also the best soundtrack. Sean Connery is acting very good and Nicolas Cage is excellent.Even Ed Harris as Frank Hummel is acting very realistic.",9,2,2,21 November 2001
