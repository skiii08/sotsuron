Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Breath taking
",This star wars was exellent! The thing i liked you may or may not agree with me but i really liked jar jar binks cause of his clumsiness it added comedy to the movie wich we haven't seen in episodes 4 and 5 we had the ewoks in the 6th episode but they were far as funny as jar jar binks and i really liked nathalie portman she's a cutie and will have a solid career ahead of her.,10,0,0,23 May 1999
