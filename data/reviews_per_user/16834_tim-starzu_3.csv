It," Overated
","When I heard this movie was coming I thought this is going to be sick but, no the old IT is way better and creepier. They tried too hard on the clown that it doesn't make the movie nor the clown creepy, It feels more like an adventure magic type of movie then a Horror. The old it was 16+ this is more like 12+. I don't say it is a bad movie I just dissapointing that this movie doesn't feel like a horror movie I just hope the second part is more scarier but with that clown im not sure.",3,1,1,9 August 2018
