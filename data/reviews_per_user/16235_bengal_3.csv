The Sound of Music," This is the best musical of all time...
","Ok, maybe not the best musical of all time.  I just wanted to refute what the other user comment was.  This was very good, however, and I just want anyone who does like musicals or just plain good movies to see it.  Don't take it from me...take it from my mother, who loves this musical (she knows what she is talking about---mother always knows).",9,1,7,7 December 1998
Psycho," It is still scary...
","I still cannot watch the shower screen without cringing.  The soundtrack is one of---if not the greatest of all time.  Without it, the movie would not be half of what it is.  If you've never seen this movie, then see it.  But I want to warn you that every now and then you will want to peek around the curtain when you take showers.",10,6,11,6 December 1998
Braveheart," I'm speechless...
","I will never forget the look on Gibson's face after the first losing battle.  This movie can reach out and touch someone.  I don't know if I've seen any movie as many times as this one.  If you never see any other movie, see this one.  It is one of the greatest of all time.",10,8,14,6 December 1998
