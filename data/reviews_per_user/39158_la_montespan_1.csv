Come and See," this is cinema
","I won't go into too much detail because other users have gone into much more technical detail but it's important to reiterate the complete brilliance if this film.I probably watch this movie about every two or three weeks and every it has the same effect every time, read total amazement, heart palpitations, panic attacks, vomiting, paranoia, psychotic episodes etc. etc. (figuratively speaking).I think I have thought about this film everyday since I first saw it about 6 months ago, of Florya's face in the forest, Glasha green dress, the twin girls, the church, the Hitler trap, the swamp, the flying bullets. And the music is equatable to taking shelter from an earthquake in an amplifier.This film will change your life. There can't possibly be a better compliment than that.",10,4,5,25 April 2008
