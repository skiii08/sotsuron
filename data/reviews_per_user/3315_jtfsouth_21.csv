Raiders of the Lost Ark," ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I don't know what more I could say about this movie that others have not said already. It was packed with cool special effects, awesome directing, incredible soundtrack,,,, and of course great  acting. This film had set the pace for future action films and still stands as one of the best.",10,0,0,17 July 2000
Training Day," Cool Flick!
","I have always been a fan of Denzel Washington and this just re-affirms my beliefs that he is just 'THAT GOOD' of an actor. I really didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but it made it that much better of a film and I would suggest this film for anyone who likes a good crime drama movie.",8,0,10,21 March 2002
Meet the Parents," too too funny
","I originally saw the trailer of this film and I didn't think it was going to be that good. Good thing that a friend of mine took me to see it (***Note: NOT the same friend who took me to see Super Star). 
      I never realized you could milk a cat:-)",9,0,0,9 April 2001
Unbreakable," Not captivating enough!
","According to tom.kat@talk21.com of Northampton, England if anyone doesn't understand this movie we should stick to Disney, and this was better than The Sixth Sense. I am sure you think Howard The Duck should have been put up for an Oscar too. Well buddy, this movie was about as easy to understand as a Disney movie so I can understand how your small brain would think so.There was no 'Twist' to this movie! There was nothing to twist to! There was nothing that would lead you to believe what the 'stunning outcome' would have been like in The Sixth Sense. In that movie there were small clues left all over the film to make you realize before the movie was over.I am not going to try and compare the scripts of The Sixth Sense, to this movie because it's like comparing an apple to an orange, two separate movies.
Bruce Willis's acting in the film was less than par as well. I am am fond of his acting but it seems that the whole movie he had no emotion,  and was boring. He didn't have anything there to make me sit and want to watch the whole movie uninterrupted. He is a much better actor than what he did in this film and probably knows it too.",6,0,1,4 July 2001
Stripes," Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarmy Training Sir!!!
",I keep wondering why my basic training was nothing like this. However it did have things in common such as the total mental cases that I would encounter over the next 13 years.Anytime I watch this film now I still sit back and laugh. It has it's share of Bill Murray's smart ass comments which only makes the film that much better.,9,1,2,19 July 2000
Full Metal Jacket," See for yourself
","I happened to see this movie 1 month before I went into basic training so needless to say when the time did come I was a little scared. After serving in the military for over 10 years now I can still watch this movie with a little sense of KNOWING how people in their situation felt going through the military. When R. Lee Ermey paces back and forth letting the recruits know their new position in life, I can't help but sit back and laugh and remember how my drill instructors did the same to us without the physical violence. I also could correlate the similarities to the people who just couldn't hack the mental abuse and tried to get out by offing themselves or A.W.O.L.
When the movie moved to Vietnam, the hell that they endured during basic training still stayed with them. However the story didn't seem to keep it's same intensity as it kept going. It didn't lose it so much that it made the movie bad it just was not as gripping to watch.
This is a movie for anyone who has ever been in or plans on going into the military. For all others who have never been in or never plan on going in the military a new sense of respect for the first group.",8,0,0,5 July 2000
Pitch Black," Too Bad it SUCKED!!!!!!!!
","I guess I must be one of the very few who thought the movie sucked. The acting was horrible, the special effects were basic and not captivating for me to even really want more. I kept looking at the timer to see how much longer the pain would go on.
      There was no character development, no story line that keeps you wondering. HELL, YOU KNEW WHO WAS GOING TO LIVE AND WHO WASN'T!!!!!!!!! If you didn't then you are an idiot,,, it was just that predictable. Now that I think about it, I don't know why I voted as high as I did. I guess I was smoking some real harsh crack.",4,0,1,9 April 2001
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypes WOW!!!
","Like some I could not even tell you how many times I have seen this movie. It can truly be called on of the best movies ever. You either love this movie or just don't care for it. For me, obviously this was a great flick. I could name 1,000,000 reasons why I loved it so much from the helicopter scene to the ceremony at the end of the film, but I couldn't name 1 reason why I didn't like it. I couln't tell you that this was just like Vietnam, but then the movie was not about Vietnam. It was about madness that drove one man to take the war on his own agenda and onother sent to eliminate him, but not before he slowly started to turn into what he was about to eliminate. The character developement not only individually but between each other seemed to increase as they went up the river. I rate this movie a 11 on a possible 10 scale",9,0,0,14 April 2000
American History X," A powerful and gripping film.
",This is just one of those films that you have to watch for yourself. I know some that can not even watch the film because they get so p***ed off despite the direction Norton's character takes after leaving prison. It is a very powerful movie that has a message for anyone watching it.I consider this one of Edward Norton's best films yet. His character was very believable and very moving. All on all this was a great movie.,10,0,0,8 August 2000
The Usual Suspects," Who is Keyser Soze?
","This is one of the best suspense movies of this past decade. Like a few others, this movie didn't rely on heavy special effects or anymore blood and guts scenes than necessary. The dialog between the characters was truly remarkable. There is not a whole lot to tell about the movie without giving anything away. What I will say about the film is that you have to pay attention to what may seem like every minor detail to actually pick up on who Keyser Soze is before the end of the film.     This is truly an original movie.",9,0,1,8 August 2000
Days of Thunder," Top Gun in a Car
","I originally saw this movie when it came out in 1986 under its original title, Top Gun. Come on, you have the same basic premise. You have a wild out of control guy who can do anything inside of car instead of a fighter jet. He meets up with a hot lady. He is tamed by a mentor and brought under to control to hone his talent. Don't forget about about the tragic event that makes him rethink his current situation if he can still do it. Last but certainly not least, he has the rivalry between him and another driver as to who really is 'The Best'.
The movie did have it's share of cool driving shots, but this is what you get from a Tony Scott film, go figure,,,, guess who directed Top Gun?If all you want is cool action and nothing to the movie, then this is your movie.",5,3,5,30 December 2001
Hellboy," Help, My Kittens!!!
","THANK GOD, I waited for this to come out on DVD. I think my subject line pretty much says what I thought of the movie. 'Oh come on, a lady happens to drop her box of kittens as Hellboy and the other freak creature fought?' Good thing that Hellboy was there to save them, fish man and fire girl may not have been up for the task.Now I hear that Hellboy 2 has been announced? If there are any fight scenes going on near a blind man who is confined to a wheel chair holding a box of new born puppies, we can all rest assure that Hellboy will be there to save them as well.Maybe next time I get the urge to see a lame film as this, my girlfriend will just remind me of the box of kittens.",5,1,3,29 July 2004
Schindler's List," Great movie
","Many movies come out each year and we applaud them for their screen play, orginality and whatever else we can say about a movie. But only once in a long while does one come out and you say all those nice things, but one you will also never forget. This movie is more than just something for us to watch for 3 hours and 17 minutes, it is something for us to never forget, to teach us a lesson and to remember those who died needlessly along with those who tried to help those same people survive.",10,442,880,15 April 2000
Rules of Engagement," This lacked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ALOT.
","This movie which was good in action lacked in the court room scenes. Throughout the movie I was waiting for something to  grip me and hold me to my seat, but then there was nothing. It left me with the question, 'That's it?'. The first thing I thought of was when Tommy Lee Jones's character went to the American Embassy and he saw the holes in the wall on the outside of the building. Why couldn't he determine the angle at which the bullets were fired from. There were holes where the bullets did penetrate, so there would have been something to give him hard proof that there were at least some shots that came from the ground. As for the court room scene, I was supprised at the verdict, because there was so little evidence to even help the defense.",4,0,1,14 April 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Too Overdone
","I wish I could say I really liked this movie but I didn't. To me it seemed that ever aspect of this film was overdone for more of a dramatic effect from the simple eye staring when Ethan and Nyah first saw each other to the outrageous bike chase at the end.Despite the fact that this was initially a t.v. series, I believe the pace of the films were set with the first movie. This movie totally went beyond realism and went into total stupidity. Am I to believe that at the end of the film when the bike chase was going on that and they were heading at each other at what seemed 90 miles per hour each / BUT WAIT, lets lessen that. Lets say they were going 40 miles per hour each. The impact that they hit each other when they jumped off the bikes would still be 80 miles per hour. LET'S GO EVEN FURTHER. Had they survived that hellish impact, they would not be able to jump back up and start pounding on each other in a full fight. Like I said it was too unrealistic.The music during the action scenes were also too much. Just shoot the damn gun and scream. I don't need the music to make it sound dramatic.
That is why I liked the first one so much more. It was believable, it had it's villains, as well as good guys. Then there were the people in between. It went to the edge of realism, but still kept you in the real world.
Save your money for a good film.",4,0,0,10 November 2000
Black Hawk Down," Better than I had hoped.
","1st I will not compare this to Saving Private Ryan, because you are dealing with 2 REALLY important issues here. Different wars all together, and the fact that Saving Private Ryan never happened, this did.
First I read the book and couldn't put it down. I was amazed and shocked by everything that these guys had been through and had to endure for 18 hours what was suppose to be a 1 or 2 hour mission. When I first heard that the movie was coming out my first reaction was to go to this web site and see who was directing it and see who was staring in it. I wasn't too thrilled to see that Jerry Bruckheimer was going to produce it. Most of his films have been nothing more than flash, no story line, good kick ass movies. but that is it. I didn't want to see this movie make light or glamorize what happened on Oct3-4th 1993, but rather keep the integrity of everything that happened, like the book had.
When the film came out several weeks before the rest of the country did in New York and L.A.,  I started to read some of the comments made. You can actually tell who read the book and who didn't. Those who didn't expected to see more action, didn't think that the Somalies came out of the woodwork like vermin ('right 235SCOPE'). Had they read the book they may have understood that most of the stuff that happened in the movie, even some of the funny comments, were in the book.
I have spent quite a few years in the military myself, so I have been there and done that, but my experiences don't EVEN pale in comparison to what hell the members of Task Force Ranger went through. For people who have NOT read the book, or have not even been there don't judge this movie by the events of what happened or even how they happened. Judge it by the direction or the acting. I though the movie was awesome. I loved how it did keep the integrity of the book and didn't diminish the events of what happened. I will always remember the names of at least 2 of them. Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon were 2 members of Delta who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for going into almost certain death.
See the movie, decide for yourself, but remember...this did happen.",9,0,0,19 January 2002
Platoon," Good vs Evil
",I couldn't tell you how many times I have seen this movie. Every time I do see it I find something new that I have missed the last time. The story line is not hard to figure out but the decisions Sheen's character has to make that are. It's a basic story of Good (Defoe) vs Evil (Berenger). This was also a summation about Stone's own experiences during Vietnam. Though the same incidents in the movie  may not have happened to Stone personally (such as what happened in the village) but the sheer chaos everything that did happen over there was a great overview of what was seen in the movie.,9,1,1,17 April 2000
Trainspotting," Good Movie!
","I don't what made me like this movie so much. It wasn't because it had a strong drug overtone, because it DID have that. Some believe that this should not have been classified as a comedy, but I would classify it as more of a dark comedy.
It did show how some choose drugs over rather than choosing life. This especially came to a point when the baby died. The biggest thing was that it didn't make light of any of the horrible situations such as the above mentioned, or the part about Tommy's death.
It's a good movie, not one for young kids, but none the less, good!",8,1,2,22 July 2000
Heat," Cool
",Don't know what to really say about this film. It was cool and all especially the gun battles (which make any action movie good)...........but that's about it. Just watch the damn thing and make up your own mind.,7,1,1,9 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatest
","What more is there to say...... 'It's Star Wars'........ it was the greatest film ever made.Since I have to use 4 lines up,,, I will just keep saying that this was the coolest, greatest, outstanding,,,,,, 'hell it has Harrison Ford!!!!!'.
If you have not seen this movie, either you have died and you are reading this from beyond the grave, or your just an idiot.",10,0,0,6 June 2000
The Thin Red Line," Did I miss something??
","I think I may have missed something about this film. Some critics thought that this was a 'Poetic Masterpiece'. A movie once in a generation, something we can learn by. Some of these same critics would also say that Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo was a masterpiece too. So needless to say I don't have a whole lot of faith in what they say.I tended to find that this film was a bit boring. The first 10 minutes I was trying to figure out where the hell this movie was going to go, and once there I still couldn't figure out what was going on. All I could say about that first 10 minutes is that I wanted the narrator to shut the hell up cause his monotone voice was putting me to sleep. I thought that the acting was a bit overdone, and there was nothing there that was too gripping.
For those who wonder why this movie did not win any awards was because the movie sucked, and the people who decides who wins the awards thought the same thing (well maybe not that it sucked, but because the other movies out there were better).
I won't compare this film to Saving Private Ryan because that WAS a better movie and the awards it won proved it.",5,1,2,7 August 2000
