Blade Runner 2049," One of the greatest film sequels ever produced...
","I'm beyond impressed with Blade Runner 2049. This sequel 35 years in the making is mesmerizing all the way down to the resolute performances, immersive production and sound design, top-notch visual effects, psychological themes, and expert cinematography, all bound by Dennis Villeneuve's skillful direction. It's excellent. An absolute marvel of thought-provoking and visually gripping storytelling. One of 2017's best and one of the greatest film sequels ever produced.",10,2,10,18 November 2017
Your Name.," Incredibly engaging...
","A visually breathtaking and emotionally resilient slice of life with a twist of fantasy, complex characterization, and a mesmeric soundtrack. Incredibly engaging, it drove me to tears. It's up there with Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke as one of the greatest anime films, at least in my opinion. It's beyond me how the Oscars overlooked this masterpiece.",10,3,5,18 November 2017
It," One of the better Stephen King adaptations...
","A well-paced, emotionally-driven story with convincing performances from a young cast, and a genuinely chilling atmosphere. Pennywise is effectively disturbing; both terrifying and hilarious, despite some tacky CGI. The characters didn't have much chemistry, too. Nevertheless, the film is dripping with thrills and sentiment, and I give it big points for those alone.",8,2,3,18 November 2017
Detroit," Intense and provoking...
","Detroit powerfully dramatizes the harsh realities and racial tensions of the 1967 Detroit riots with skillful direction and grounded performances, Will Poutler's being particularly fearsome and newcomer Algee Smith generating a lot of sympathy. However, I wasn't a fan of the act structure as it seemed episodic. The third act focuses on the legal results of the riots, which felt like a completely different film compared to the distressing sequences before it. I'll give it minor leeway for it's historical context, but the Algiers Motel act was strong enough to be it's own picture and could've done without the bloated first and third acts. Not an easy watch, but it's essential cinema and another milestone for director Kathryn Bigelow. Intense and provoking. One of 2017's best.",9,2,9,18 November 2017
Rocketman," A corny romp, but that's what's so amazing about it...
","Unlike most biopics, Rocketman one dives into the psyche of Sir Elton John to present a radically upbeat and stylish musical that also takes time to breathe and explore his struggles with fame, identity and abuse.The musical sequences are a riot; beautiful sung and boasting fast-paced and captivating choreography. The effort really shows; its on par with La La Land. I found it a pleasant surprise because I went into the film expecting a dull, by-the-books documentation of a famous person's life, but was treated with a rather buoyant and offbeat approach to the genre. I'm sure it's been done before with other biopics about musicians I have yet to watch, but this is a first for me, and I loved it.Despite some moments of rushed pacing, a strong tone balance and charismatic performance by Taron Egerton makes this picture fly high and it's gonna be a long, long time before another biopic captures the raw spirit of its star artist. I better see Egerton with an Oscar in his hand next year. A marvelous film.",9,2,3,5 June 2019
Wind River," Grim, yet beautiful...
","Although the film lacks any powerful twists and revelations, Wind River passes with stellar direction that boasts a grim yet beautiful snowy wilderness and chilling performances bound by a character-driven screenplay. It has a very palpable western film or Hell or High Water vibe, given it's written by the same filmmaker. Sadly, the overall mystery lacks any compelling twists or revelations. Very run-of-the-mill.",7,0,4,18 November 2017
Darkest Hour," Charming and empowering...
","Darkest Hour is a fascinating war-time biopic with excellent acting, cinematography, and music. Gary Oldman delivers an empowering performance which is backed up with a rich noir vibe. Some sequences felt sluggish, but Oldman's tenacity and well-timed comedic touch managed to refuel my investment. The cosmetic work is impressive, I almost didn't recognize Oldman and he radiates such a dauntless energy as Winston Churchill. There's a particular scene where Churchill casually interacts with British citizens on a train that I found very charming and uplifting. Darkest Hour is certainly Oldman's finest achievement.",9,0,3,10 January 2018
Passengers," An abundantly clichéd, melodramatic slog...
","I was quite surprised that it got mostly negative reviews last year, it seemed promising. Now I know why. It is an abundantly clichéd, melodramatic slog that squanders potential to explore deep humanistic themes and twist its narrative, instead coping out with underdeveloped romance and cheap thrills. It ends up being Titanic in space. Aside from its dazzling and immersive production design and music, Passengers is nothing new or interesting.",4,0,1,18 November 2017
Us," Great artistry, but standard overall...
","I really wanted to love Us, but I could only bring myself to simply like it. It's certainly creepy and thought-provoking, but also quite predictable. I didn't think the twists were that intriguing (or really added up overall). Even though the writing didn't do it for me, I do appreciate the artistry. It's only Jordan Peele's second film, but his craft is spellbinding. He knows how to captivate the audience. The acting, the shots, the editing, the pacing are all top-notch and kept me chilled and engaged throughout. If the third act wasn't so underwhelming (especially after so much lengthy tension-building), I would consider it a masterpiece of horror like the rest of the world.",8,39,78,24 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Not fresh, but a mighty fun time...
","Truthfully, I'm really on the fence on whether I consider Deadpool 2 better or worse than the first film. This sequel does contain elements that improve greatly over its predecessor, yet its one key factor hasn't necessarily aged well. However, what Deadpool 2 gets right is it's surprisingly thoughtful story. The film follows Deadpool attempting to set a hate-filled young mutant onto a better path despite already reeling from a personal tragedy. Instead of going berserk and slaughtering everyone in sight out of grief (something you'd probably expect him to do immediately), Deadpool sees something of himself in Firefist and wants to defend him from Cable and change his future into a brighter, less tragic and destructive one similar to his own. This was an unexpected character turn for Deadpool, it was quite refreshing to see him display remorse and go to such lengths to instill hope into Firefist (something Colossus had faith in for Deadpool), despite a few needlessly mean-spirited moments where he weirdly broke that character arc for no foreseeable reason. At the heart-rending center is Julian Dennison, who does a brilliant job portraying a spunky, yet emotionally broken teenager that calls back to his breakout performance in Taika Waliti's indie film The Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which I highly recommend watching. It's funny, original, and GANGSTA! But, I digress...With gun fights, swordplay, and bucketloads of extraneous gore splattering the walls, the action didn't disappoint, it lives up to the R-rating and it's a lot of fun to watch, especially when both Domino and Cable are thrown into the mix. In my opinion, Domino's mutant power is pretty ludicrous, but in an amusing way. She is able to survive potentially fatal events and change her opponents chances of gaining the upper hand instantly with just her presence. She can even twist a conversation to her advantage effortlessly like a Jedi mind trick or something out of Looney Tunes. It's absurd, but it results in some fast-paced, wildly entertaining action, and even some decent laughs to spare, namely Deadpool's confounded reactions to her success in combat. Cable is just a scary brute and some of the more grittier set-pieces involve him. When he strikes somebody you almost feel the weight and excruciating pain that comes with it, much like Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War (who Brolin also portrayed). It's quite astonishing to watch. I've never read any Deadpool comics that included Cable but I think I can say with firm confidence that the filmmakers really nailed the cyborg's beastly, intimidating figure and demeanor. Moments involving Cable really had me catching my breath (and in a good way, like a healthy work out). Deadpool 2, like the first film, is the marathon of joyously ultra-violent action and flippant humor you'd pretty much expect, but I personally think it outshines its predecessor in terms of heart. I must say that the weakest element of the film was the comedy. The humor was hit-and-miss this time around for me, I mostly smiled at the gags, very few scenes had me audibly laughing, and I felt some jokes were a bit overplayed and try-hardy; the scene following the climax serving as a huge example. Brace yourself for some overlong, cringy, eye-rolling sentiment that could've been easily cut. Despite that massive personal setback, I was nonetheless stirred by the set-pieces and charmed by the characters. Deadpool 2 is not the freshest experience, but it's a mighty fun continuation. Make sure to stick around for the mid-credits scenes, they were quite a treat, especially if you despised X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds' Green Lantern.",8,4,9,31 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A stylish powerhouse of thrills and laughs...
","Adopting a lustrous and flippant vibe similar to the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor: Ragnarok is a stylish powerhouse of action and laughs, and delivers some long overdue character development for Thor and chemistry with the Hulk. Despite an incessantly episodic narrative structure, it's a rare second sequel that's teeming with fun, and blows its bland and forgettable predecessors out of the water. Thank Odin for no Kat Dennings and Natalie Portman. I love Thor's new look. Good riddance, long hair!",8,1,4,16 November 2017
Ready Player One," An action-packed, funny, and visually striking ode to geekdom...
","Based on the Ernest Cline novel, Ready Player One is set in the year 2045. People use a vast, limitless virtual world called 'The Oasis' to escape their slum-ridden reality. After the Oasis' creator James Halliday dies, he issues a three-step easter egg hunt to all Oasis users that will grant the winner his fortune and control over the Oasis. When 18-year-old Wade Watts is the first user to uncover Halliday's first clue, the corrupt video game conglomerate Innovative Online Industries (IOI), led by Nolan Sorrento, resorts to hostile means in order to acquire control over The Oasis. Wade joins a rebellion led by famous Oasis user Art3mis to find Halliday's easter egg before IOI does. The film is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Spielberg and stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance.This film adaptation deviates from the novel quite a lot, but in some ways for the better. The story in the novel is very complex and often drifts into slow, overstuffed territory here and there, but the film takes a much more briskly-paced, focused and easy-to-understand approach, ignoring filler and driving the story forward with each simple occurrence. This is mostly due to the more practical challenges the characters endure in order to solve Halliday's easter egg clues. In the book, the challenges are very unorthodox and require loads of exposition because chances are the reader won't know a thing about the specific game or movie from the 1980s that's heavily involved in the challenge. In the movie, one of the challenges is a race. Everyone knows what a race is. Done. Explanation redundant. Carry on with the story. It's that straight-forward and a massive improvement over the novel.The film is a constant surge of nostalgic fun. It features a plethora of cameos from movies, video games and even music, with some breathtaking CGI to back them all up. Examples include Back to the Future, The Shining, Overwatch, The Iron Giant, King Kong, and even Battletoads. Think of it as the Who Framed Roger Rabbit of 70s, 80s, and 90s pop culture. Like in the novel, a clear appreciation for geek culture is displayed, and it really had me grinning and chuckling for a majority of the runtime. Thankfully, the film doesn't go overboard with these cameos to the point where it distracts from the story. In fact, they help deliver quite a thrilling final battle, the visual highlight overall.The performances were adequate, mostly hoaky coming from the younger cast members, but I must single out Mark Rylance as James Halliday. Halliday is the film's emotional highlight. Rylance's performance appears to be a homage to the late Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. In fact, before Wilder's death I believe Spielberg attempted to have Wilder come out of retirement for a final film role. Could've been this one? Anyways, Halliday is just an eccentric, old man in search for a worthy successor. He has an affective personal history that strongly supports the story, and his final monologue is quite absorbing, especially coming from a doddery old soul lost in his own world. Alan Silvestri's score is a whimsical nod to Back to the Future, which he also composed. The music also includes some thematic touches similar to the work of John Williams', Spielberg's frequent collaborator who was originally set to score Ready Player One.On the unfortunate side, the character chemistries are pretty weak, which is too bad because the film at first takes a more interesting route with Wade and Art3mis' connection. Rather than meeting in person at the very end of the story, Wade and Art3mis meet personally very early on in the film and even spend a lot of screentime outside of the Oasis. Their in-person interactions should've established a more genuine chemistry and romance because they're seeing their non-avatar bodies for the first time and they lived up to their expectations, but in the end it's just another formulaic, hasty Disney channel-esque love story. They barely have anything in common, yet they become a couple just to please a demographic. Boring!Some characters pivotal to the story are kind of downplayed, namely Ogden Morrow, Halliday's friend, former colleague and the co-founder of the Oasis. Morrow was very important in the book and personally assisted the main characters when danger escalated. In a kind of a predictable twist, Morrow does still help the protagonists uncover Halliday's egg before IOI, but it's one of the few creative liberties against the novel that I think didn't work right and didn't serve much justice for Simon Pegg's minimal involvement. The film needed more upfront interaction with Morrow. Some sequences in the novel featuring Morrow were very dark and exciting; they would've made for some dazzling set-pieces. Some scenes that left massive impacts in the novel felt rushed, such as Wade meeting his friend Aech in reality, which ignores a rather humorous revelation, and especially the ending, which seemed very abrupt in the wake of a riveting, near hour-long climax. Despite my gripes, I think Ready Player One is a fun ride. It's an action-packed, funny, and visually striking ode to geekdom everywhere and every era. The cameos ranged from familiar to extremely unconventional, and they deliver quite a wild climax. However, it's difficult to NOT compare/contrast with Ernest Cline's novel. Some liberties felt justified, but the character chemistries were pretty weak, and some moments felt rushed and complicated the story a bit. Also some characters that were pivotal in the book were sadly downplayed. But as a movie, it's mighty fine popcorn entertainment. Spielberg really knows how to tackle every genre.",8,0,1,19 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Timely, disturbing, and often funny...
","As expected from a Spike Lee joint, BlacKkKlansman explores race relations in an shamelessly dark and off-beat manner. It succeeds in triggering a genuine reaction out of you; Disturbing, but often very funny, thanks to the resolute performances of Washington and Driver. There are some pacing issues due to some overlong, pretentious sequences, and I wasn't a fan of the ending, which leaps ahead in time to showcase fairly recent events of social unrest that have minimal connection to the story that was dramatized. I'm not saying these horrid events should go on ignored, but it was just an abrupt and preachy way to close what was a very well-crafted film. I don't think BlacKkKlansman is the masterpiece most critics claim it is. It's certainly a timely and important movie, but there were a few choices Lee made that soured part of the experience for me.",7,5,13,20 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A coming-of-age superhero comedy...
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is a coming-of-age superhero comedy that, while often formulaic, is fast-paced and quirky with just enough suspense to balance it all out. Tom Holland is super charming and perfectly encapsulates the wisecracking jokester persona of Spider-Man and Michael Keaton plays a rather scary and riveting bad guy. I wasn't that much of a fan of the supporting characters, primarily the love interest, Liz. She suffers the same fate as Mary Jane in the Sam Raimi trilogy: She's nothing more but an object for Spider-Man to go after. She's not interesting whatsoever; nothing more than a forced plot device. Zendaya got pushed aside for her? Zendaya's character, Michelle Jones was snarky, off-beat and hilarious and much more likable than Liz. Why wasn't she the love interest?",8,18,30,17 November 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dark and engaging art house...
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the best written film of 2017. A model blend of sullen humor and richly engaging drama, boasting dark, unexpected turns, and timely social commentary, all in a very distinctive fashion. Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell's performances effectively carry this cleverly written black comedy from beginning to end.",10,2,7,18 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It's amazing how formulaic and derivative it is...
","I'll give credit when it's due, the action and imagery in The Rise of Skywalker is enthralling and I couldn't help but grin at the nostalgic fan service. God, it's so forced, but the charm always disarms me. That's it, though. That's everything of value I got out of this film. It's a fine set piece movie. What it flounders at is telling an effective, original and comprehensible story and concluding it on an impactful note. It's amazing how formulaic and derivative it is. The characters are just too Mary Sue, uninteresting and nothing they do or achieve feels especially earned. Even worse than The Last Jedi, the film plays it too safe and bails when it does get potentially interesting. There were a few legitimate twists I didn't see coming but seconds later the film drops them like they never happened. It's so frustrating. I walked out of The Rise of Skywalker feeling nothing and being that Star Wars is a shining example of cinema, that didn't feel right at all. Looking back, this sequel trilogy is just a really big fan of the original...and it's a lazy and manipulative one.",4,18,29,2 January 2020
The Lost City of Z," Bold and endearing...
","An adventure biopic about explorer Percy Fawcett's ill-fated expedition for a lost city in the Amazon jungle. Charlie Hunnum's leading performance is bold and endearing, the early 1900s production design is authentically raw and the Amazonian sequences are enrapturing given the passionate manner of how Fawcett approaches obstacles and inhabitants, the intensive editing and warm and vibrant color correction. Though, the non-Amazonian sequences tend to drag on for too long and the final act seemed oddly tame and could've been a lot more intense and emotional. A great watch, overall.",8,0,0,18 November 2017
Baby Driver," Treat yourself with something wild and original...
","Baby Driver is a marathon of high-octane and offbeat thrills, syncing music with motion in a refreshingly stylized fashion. This is action cinema done right and the best film I've seen this year thus far. While the story may seem like an assembly line 'boy meets girl' set-up, the spectacle makes up for it phenomenally, boasting what I think is the most unique use of licensed music I've ever seen in a film.",10,0,2,17 November 2017
Justice League," A big step backward for DCEU...
","Justice League is a cluttered tonal jumble with cheap writing, wooden characters, intermittent pacing, and a wasted supporting cast. Yet, the action was a decent surge of popcorn thrills. If Zack Synder can master anything, it's imagery, and it wasn't Transformers level of blaring. It was neat to see Aqua Man, Flash, and Cyborg do their thing for a couple set-pieces, but their individual narratives should've launched beforehand. Their rushed introductions could not generate an affective connection, therefore I could careless what happened to them or how they interacted with Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. I hate to make a forced comparison to The Avengers, but those characters are complex, endearing and their colorful personalties play of each other adequately. The Justice League are insipid bores. Definitely not a good film, and that irritates me because I want this film universe to succeed, it should be amazing, and Wonder Woman was such a return to form. Justice League, however, was a big step backward.",4,3,6,19 November 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," If this was an apology for the Emoji Movie, then apology accepted!
","I have to say, and no pun-intended: Into the Spider-Verse is a total marvel, all the way down to its stylish and diverse styles of animation to its bold, sophisticated storytelling. The visuals are absolutely enchanting. Fast, colorful, and distinct. Something Sony Animation always nails is how each character has a pronounced look and movement. With the various kinds of Spider-Men and Marvel villains featured in this story, the animators went all out to give them a unique identity. Notably in this case are Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. Noir, whose universe takes place in 1930s New York, boasts a dark, shadowy vibe similar to Sin City, Peni Parker has a bubbly anime look, and Spider-Ham is a bouncy, eccentric cartoon character who takes full advantage of his absurd existence to deliver some of the film's best laughs. Even with these different identities, the film slows down to balance their character in a serious nature. Heck, one of the most hard-hitting, poignant lines is spoken by Spider-Ham, the breakout comedic relief.Miles and a majority of characters share the same art style. I really enjoy the blend of 3D models with traditional 2D movement. It's very appealing to watch and it seamlessly matches the comic book theme. I also appreciate the stylization of certain villains. Kingpin is a character I don't think was portrayed accurately outside of the comics, just appearing as a generic, heavy-set bald brute, when he's really an enormous, borderline non-human tank. Kingpin looks excellent in this film, with his titanic body and small head with an intimidating grimace. He's a powerful force and a legitimately scary antagonist. Doc Ock is another example, portrayed as a brilliant, but outlandish female scientist with a psychotic passion for villainy. I didn't feel like I needed to know more about her character, she was such a fun villainess to watch. She really added to the suspense in some action sequences.I really loved the story. I thought it was rich with charm and thrills. Granted, I did notice some familiar elements that are done to death in superhero fiction and the animation canon alike, such as surprise villain reveals and major character deaths that were obviously seen coming, and I certainly wish some characters (espeically Miles' uncle) had more screentime, but there's one fact that overshadows these flaws for me: The writing is mature. First of all, it's a Sony Animation product. If you look at this company's past work, some of it is very soulless with its marketing and panders to its audience with incessant pop culture references and juvenile comedy. Into the Spider-Verse is a welcome departure. Passion and integrity was put into this project. The writing is very grounded and treats its audience like people who want to see a genuinely captivating flick. Heck, the first third of the film is somewhat slow and nonchalant, almost like an arthouse film. I've never had such a cool, yet off-beat and engaged feeling while watching an animated film on the big screen. Nothing was forced, nothing felt out-of-place, nothing took me out of immersion. The tone and pacing is very adult, even when something excessively goofy like Spider-Ham is on-screen. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It can be dark and distressing, but lighthearted and amusing. There's a perfect balance and it never sacrifices integrity just to appeal to a niche audience. Well...there is that after-credits scene, but it was quite hilarious, so I let it pass.That's the most I can say without spoiling a lot of the film. I want you to see this absolute marvel with your own eyes. To close, Into the Spider-Verse is everything I hoped it would be. This is a game-changer for both superhero filmmaking and animation altogether. Sleek, colorful, funny, emotional, frenetic. This film skillfully balances all these elements. There is never a moment that felt forced, it never talks down to the audience. It's a mature and stylish take on the Spider-Man mythos, and perhaps the best big-screen Spidey picture to date with some of the best animated visuals you'll ever see. I didn't have a single issue with this film. I was dazzled and moved throughout. Sony Animation, if this was your apology for The Emoji Movie, then apology goddamn accepted. Massive bravo!",10,1142,1330,14 December 2018
Dunkirk," Could've upped the ante and risked an R rating...
","Dramatizing one of WWII's least regarded events, Dunkirk is a powerhouse of suspense and a distinctive (but not fully realized) departure of the typical war film formula. I admire it for its vision and unique method of storytelling, backed up by some breathtaking and skillful cinematography, editing and tension-building musical score, but the character's lacked identity with incredibly forgettable performances and it's supremely underwhelming in terms of action. Could've upped the ante and risked an R rating. Didn't enjoy it to the level of most people.",6,2,4,17 November 2017
Yesterday," Charming and timely, but needed more depth....
","Yesterday doesn't do a whole lot with its premise as I'd hoped, but it's pleasant and straightforward enough for a recommended viewing, especially for Beatles fans and aspiring musicians. The film's about a lowly musician who after an accident awakes to find the Beatles never existed and sings their songs to become famous. It's a laid back, cautionary tale on plagiarism and the pressures of fame and studies how much the music industry's perception and demands have changed since the golden age with the Beatles. It could've gone into more depth with its premise and it has its formulaic moments, but it gets its messages across regardless and the performances were charming enough to keep me captivated.",7,1,2,9 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The end of an era, but the start of a new one...
","Endgame is some of the greatest fun I've had in the theater. Everything in the past 21 films comes together to make this film the best finale it can possibly be. This three hour epic is brimming with sheer suspense, hearty laughs, exciting action, fitting sendoffs to the characters we grew to love and charming revisitations of the universe's finest moments. It's an excellent balance of fan service and emotionally-driven storytelling. There's so many moments that choked me up, got me pumped and blew my expectations away. That said, the film does pose some noticeable inconstancies with the universe's timeline and raises unanswered questions, but everything else is so tremendous that I can easily overlook them. Endgame is a beautiful culmination of the past 11 years. Take my word for it: It's amazing. The end of an era, but the start of a new one.",10,0,3,28 April 2019
Toy Story 4," A sharply written, beautifully animated sendoff...
","Just when I thought Toy Story hit its peak with 3, the fourth chapter comes out of nowhere to offer up an equally effective helping of smart, emotional and funny storytelling that made its predecessors timeless masterpieces resonating with all ages. The writing remains top-notch, exploring thought-provoking dilemmas that have the protagonists (and audience) often second-guessing themselves and make the villains and their motivations understandable and investing. I also found 4 to be the funniest of the series. Forky, Ducky and Bunny (played by Tony Hale from Arrested Development, Key and Peele, respectively) are the comedic highlights; I was legitimately laughing out loud at their dialogue and antics. Toy Story 4 is far from the cash grab many thought it would be. It's sharply written, beautifully animated and brings the series to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. What a journey.",10,88,166,23 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," So many emotions.
","My head is spinning. I'm both pumped up and in ruins over Infinity War. Tons of grand action sequences, each hero gets a fair amount of screentime, and there's a fine balance of charming fan service and heartrending suspense. It really went directions I didn't expect; Thanos turned out to be quite an emotionally complex villain. My gripes are mostly technical, just some sloppy editing and cinematography that plagued a couple action scenes and there were a few scenes where a hero's character development from a previous MCU entry was completely nullified, but I give it some leeway because it resulted in some pretty awesome fan service. Without spoiling anything, Infinity War lives up tremendously to its decade-long hype.",9,2,7,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A different change in pace for Tarantino, but stylish and funny nonetheless...
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a stylish ode to 1960s Hollywood that completely drenches itself in the culture with extravagant production values and over-the-top performances. It's a much different change in pace compared to Tarantino's other work; more talk, less action. Despite being sluggish and disjointed at times, the cast does a brilliant job capturing the spirit of the time period. Leo and Pitt are wicked likable and play off eachother naturally. It doesn't completely shed itself of the gleefully ultra violent thrills that Tarantino is best known for. It's got a few lovely sequences, but I implore Tarantino fans to shift gears a bit and not expect a total splatter house. Allow the acting to sink in. Not the strongest of Tarantino's work, but still a very good product.",8,35,59,26 July 2019
Get Out," A Key & Peele sketch with a horror skin...
","I can kinda see why Get Out received so much praise. It's essentially a Key & Peele sketch with a horror skin. Smart and chilling social satire with fine performances and strong tension building. My personal criticisms: Weak scares, and forgiving action and gore. Too much last-second cutaway nonsense. I can't say it really lives up to the R rating. Definitely an interesting film nonetheless, but I wouldn't put it on my favorites of 2017.",7,1,2,18 November 2017
A Quiet Place," I'm not even a horror fan, but I loved it...
","Aside from The Thing and Alien, horror has never been my ideal film genre, though if a horror film possesses an interesting premise I won't hesitate to see what transpires. I was deeply engaged throughout A Quiet Place. Despite the little amount of dialogue, a strong connection is developed between the Abbots, who need to communicate exclusively with American Sign Language so their spoken dialogue doesn't attract the creatures. The performances of Blunt, Krasinski, Simmonds, and Jupe are all stellar, their characters are absolutely wracked with fear, guilt, and loss because of the desolate world they live in and the traumatic events they've endured. Simmonds is the dramatic highlight, playing a troubled child overwhelmed with blame over the death of a loved one she inadvertently caused. You will root for these character's survival thanks to the believable performances and emotionally investing writing that tailored them. Props to Krasinski for his skillful direction. The cinematography often tells the story more than the action and dialogue so you really gotta work your mind around the meaning of certain shots to piece together the full narrative. I personally enjoyed the setting that's established in this film. Of course, the whole world has been overrun by these sound-sensitive creatures, yet the film exclusively takes place in a rural location, which is my personal favorite setting in a post-apocalyptic story. The Abbott's farm is a very unique location, as it is elaborately sound proofed. Watching the family silently and creatively engage in various everyday tasks and activities that generally emit noise was quite engaging. This movie does a brilliant job immersing you in the character's mindset. Like the Abbots, I genuinely panicked too when a loud noise was accidentally made and when the creatures came running. Because of the wide open space and limited resources of their rural home, it made me wonder how the characters would escape their perilous situations, and the film is a powerhouse of tension-inducing set-pieces of this type. My only personal setback was the ending, and without giving anything vital away, A Quiet Place is one of those thrillers that closes with uncertainty, leaving the outcome up to the audience's interpretation. Most people are okay with this, but I just felt it could've ended on a more serene and hopeful note rather than teasing us with a potentially riveting new set-piece. A Quiet Place had me at the edge of my seat throughout. It tells a thought-provoking story about family and survival with minimal dialogue and tons of nerve-wracking tension. I just wish the ending was more established rather than leaving the viewers to assume what happened. Regardless, it has an intriguing premise, strong performances, bold production design, and smart direction. Value the theater experience for this one, it's half the thrill.",9,4,6,8 July 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A tale not worth telling...
","I think it's high time Disney dropped the anchor for the Pirates franchise as this fifth installment went in no new directions. It's noisy, unfunny, and painfully unbalanced. The villain is forgettable, Jack Sparrow contributes nothing to the story, and the quirky nature clashes unevenly with the darker and grittier sequences, a flaw that's persisted worse and worse since Curse of the Black Pearl. There are a few entertaining set- pieces, but for the most part Dead Men Tell No Tales is a mindnumbing and senseless picture that was absolutely dreadful to sit through.",1,7,10,17 November 2017
Coco," The newest Pixar classic...
","Coco is spectacular. After many recent dips in quality, Pixar has delivered a picture that's quite the return to form and a respectful interpretation of Mexican culture. Coco is a dazzling and emotional Mexican fairy tale with plucky characters, smart twists, lively music, and tons of fast and creative animation to back it all up. Along with Inside Out, I personally think Coco reaches the heights of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up, and all the Pixar classics prior to the company's downfall starting with Cars 2, and I hope it's regarded as a classic for years to come. I can tell Pixar poured a lot of passion and inventiveness into this one and it really shows.",10,3,16,23 November 2017
1917," Easily one of the best war movies I've ever seen...
","1917 is a breathtaking feat. Filmed and edited to appear as a single tracking shot throughout, 1917 is a skillfully crafted powerhouse of suspense and emotion that poetically captures the stress and eeriness of trench warfare with engaging performances and gritty production design all around. Heart-pounding and technically superb.",10,8,12,10 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not the strongest continuation...
","The Last Jedi is a problematic follow-up to The Force Awakens. There's hardly any character growth, intriguing twists are left abandoned, and it's just a cluttered tonal jumble overall; too many narratives with very unbalanced drama and comedic relief. On the upside, the action is still quite thrilling, backed up with some neat visuals and John Williams' musical score, but the storytelling is an absolute mess. A middle chapter should really end on an explosive cliffhanger, and it could've if one major revelation took the opposite route. It all just came off as formulaic. Also those Porgs were ear-bleedingly obnoxious. Tons of potential wasted, and a lot of room for improvement.",5,1,2,20 December 2017
Logan," A raw and ultimately fitting exit for the character...
","The chemistry between Logan and the girl isn't particularly strong, but I still think Logan is the best X-Men film to date as well as the redeeming standalone Wolverine film. Intense, ultra-violent, depressing, and doesn't cop out with cartoonish villains and fight sequences. It's a raw and ultimately fitting exit for the character.",8,3,7,17 November 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Take it for what it is and be their guest...
","Despite a few overly hokey performances and taking some offhanded and redundant liberties, Beauty and the Beast is a respectful reimagining of the classic animated film. The musical sequences sound wonderful and are dazzlingly choreographed, the sets and effects are beyond gorgeous, and the more downplayed characters from the original film earn some spotlight (JOSH GAD IS BRILLIANT). It nowhere near matches the heart and spectacle of the original, but it's still quite a visual treat. Take it for what it is and be their guest.",7,2,5,17 November 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Continues the story in a dazzling and heartfelt fashion...
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an absolute blast and in my humble opinion, it outshines the first. An action-packed, outrageously funny, and emotionally-driven sequel that boasts another eclectic and oddly fitting soundtrack. I was grinning from start to finish at how much of a stylized powerhouse it was, though I wasn't a fan of the Guardians being separated for most of the story; their interplay is the strongest element, but when they are together it always hits. Nonetheless, it continues the character's story in a dazzling and heartfelt fashion like a good sequel should.",9,0,1,17 November 2017
The Shape of Water," A wonder to behold...
","The Shape of Water is absolutely enchanting. Filmmaking at its most bold and sterling fashion. In theory, the premise of a timid young woman having sexual relations with a humanoid sea monster sounds bizarre and cringeworthy, but Guillermo del Toro's dark and extravagant craft has you see more of the beauty and elegance in the situation other than the disturbing nature. Sally Hawkins' delivers a silent yet spirited leading performance that effectively fuels the emotional and alluring moments surrounding her and the monster. The Shape of Water is simply fascinating. A unique 'beauty and beast' story. It is Del Toro's magnum opus. A wonder to behold. Best film of 2017.",10,30,54,17 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Follow your dream...
","The Disaster Artist is one of 2017's best pictures. It's an insightful tribute to outsider filmmaking and a genuine chronicle of friendship and artistic struggle. At the center is James Franco, who brilliantly captures the outlandish and ambitious spirit of Tommy Wiseau. It's not easy to get your name out there, to please an audience, and to work with a group of people who don't believe in your vision, and this film explores these conflicts and encourages you to follow your dream. It could've dived deeper into Sestero's memoirs, but that's really scraping the bottom of the barrel. The focus is where it should be and it's fascinating nonetheless.",9,0,2,7 January 2018
Mudbound," Brutally raw and honest...
","Looking for something to watch on Netflix? I recommend Mudbound. It is a gritty and engrossing period drama film that explores post-WWII America in ethnic perspectives as the country descends into bigoted unrest. It's brutally raw and honest with its setting and characters, which are held up affectively by some excellent performances. Technical nit-picks include some poor color correction and sound design that took me out of a few pivotal sequences. Otherwise, it's a powerful film. I better see it at the next Oscars!",8,4,12,22 November 2017
Joker," I'll never listen to Frank Sinatra the same way again...
","Joker is an outstanding character study. One of 2019's biggest surprises, pushing the boundaries of what you're comfortable with looking at. Not once did it seem like I was watching a comic book movie. It's a chilling and artful approach to the iconic villain that doesn't hold back on exploring mental illness and the lower class in a brutally raw and honest way. Even with its occasional touches on the Batman mythos, which flowed well with the story and didn't seemed forced at all, the focus is entirely on Arthur Fleck's turmoil and transformation into the Joker and Joaquin Phoenix delivers a richly disturbing performance to support that. The psychological twists to some story cliches were unexpected and refreshing, too. Amazing film. Not for the faint of heart. I'll never listen to Frank Sinatra the same way again.",10,3,5,15 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Bravo, you beautifully wacky film...
","63% on Rotten Tomatoes? What movie did those critics see? It: Chapter 2 is a genuine delight. Sounds like an oxymoron, yes: A delightful horror film? But honestly, I really had fun with this one. I think Chapter 2 has a lot more levity than the first film, both thematically and comically, thanks to its downright creepy and hilarious imagery and Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård's righteous performances. Yes, it's a long sit, but it went by fast because it was so off-the-walls. I can sympathize with Stephen King fans and horror die-hards for wanting something legitimately scary, and I agree that it could've used more authentic terror, but...the villain is a CLOWN. Yes, I wanted to be scared, but I also wanted to be amused, and holy smokes, it's enough of a wild ride for me to recommend on a whole other level. I could be missing the point, but my care factor is in the negative. Bravo, you beautifully wacky film. Bravo to the cast, too.",8,3,5,11 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Mindless popcorn entertainment at its finest...
","Kong: Skull Island is as if they dropped the colossal ape in Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket, resulting in a thoroughly entertaining monster flick that shouldn't be taken seriously; a well-paced and well-cast marathon of action and thrills. I must single out John C. Reilly's performance. He provides an ample amount of wit and heart amongst the band of stock characters. Leave your brain outside the theater. It's mindless popcorn entertainment at its finest.",7,10,15,17 November 2017
Parasite," A stunning look at social conflict...
","With engaging performances, a deft use of dark comedy, and thrilling twists that add up, Parasite is a smart and haunting take on conflicting social classes, showing how both the poor and the wealthy can equally be the villains in their respectively desperate and callous ways. It's not impossible to respect each other and co-exist. Parasite has really opened my eyes to foreign language films and rightfully deserves its historic Best Picture win. A stunning film.",10,14,21,12 February 2020
Wonder Woman," A rise to form for DCEU...
","Wonder Woman is the rise to form that the DC Extended Universe so desperately needed. It follows the typical origin story formula, but it's more coherently paced and stabilizes the tone much more intelligently than the previous DCEU installments. Gal Gadot nails the role of Wonder Woman with a deft balance of headstrong charisma and comical innocence. The action is stylized and wickedly entertaining, and Diana's naive interactions with real world customs (especially during a time period where women were looked down upon) make for some clever comedic relief. The first act was kinda bland with little exploration and inventiveness put into Diana's home-world, but overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Wonder Woman. It renewed my faith in the DCEU and I pray that the filmmakers continue to learn from their past flaws and produce even better spectacles in the coming years.",8,12,21,17 November 2017
Pitch Perfect 3," Far from a strong send-off...
","Some of the musical sequences still flourish and Anna Kendrick is an irresistible lead as always, but the plot is just...bizarre. It adopts a crime genre sub-narrative that doesn't flow seamlessly with the series' traditional formula. As a result, conflicts and chemistries are either rushed to fruition or left totally unresolved. What happened to the vocals vs. instruments rivalry? It's abandoned just as fast as it's introduced. Talk about wasted talent. This is far from a strong send-off. The previous films, despite being incredibly predictable, still managed to carry more wit, heart, and flowing narratives. Definitely not worth the investment. Treat Pitch Perfect 2 as the true swan song.",4,0,1,15 March 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Radically unconventional, but timely nonetheless...
","Jojo Rabbit is the funniest film the year. Bear with me, it's about a Hitler youth befriending a Jewish girl who is hiding in his house. Sounds potentially offensive given the time period and that the protagonist is a self-proclaimed Nazi but the offbeat sweetness and humor really shines through. It portrays Nazis as total buffoons throughout and it's a riot, though it also doesn't ignore the harsh realities of the innocent, naive youth during wartime, which is important but makes the film kind of a tonal jumble at points. It's an anti-hate satire that's both a straight middle finger to racism but cements allegorically that it's not going away and the best we can do is move forward dauntlessly. Taika Waititi is a comedic and symbolic wizard. Again, the offbeat nature of the film may not resonate with most, but I found a lot of amusement, emotion and food for thought out of it. It's a black comedy. It explores dark subject matter in a quirky fashion.",9,2,8,17 November 2019
Incredibles 2," An INCREDIBLE sequel...
","Like a good sequel should, Incredibles 2 continues the story with fresh ideas and dilemmas for each character. What it does better than the original is its focus on the entire Parr family and how they juggle both hero and civilian life. I adore the first Incredibles, but most of the focus was centered on Mr. Incredible and his personal crisis of reliving the glory days. In the sequel, we not only follow Elastigirl's action-packed new job, but we also explore Mr. Incredible trying to connect closer with his children who he hardly interacted with in the first film. Not only does he need to tame Jack-Jack and his chaotic new abilities, but he must also console his teenage daughter Violet as she endures boy troubles, and help his son Dash who is struggling with his schoolwork. This is new territory for Mr. Incredible and it results in some genuinely funny and touching chemistry, and I personally think its where the film soars at its highest. The movie is called The Incredibles, which suggests the movie is about all of them, therefore featuring a strong family connection is essential, and the sequel does a better job at that. With each viewing of the original film, I found myself more and more impressed with the subtle lore that The Incredibles' universe possesses. Their world is set in a supremely anachronistic 1960s era where technology has rapidly heightened. Incredibles 2 doesn't ignore this mythology and expands it with blinding creativity. From the architecture, to the clothing, to the machinery, the film is absolutely dripping with a retro-futuristic imagery. The mythos regarding superheroes is a charming call back to the golden age of superhero comics and cartoons, with the colorful suits, flashy names, and a diverse array of abilities that opens the door for tons of fast-paced inventiveness during the action sequences. It's an engrossing and smartly-designed world, yet Brad Bird keeps the focus where it should be: On the family and their story. The imagery and lore has a casual but unique and dazzling prescience that requires more than one viewing to fully absorb. The original film, however, does one element a lot better than the sequel, and that's the main antagonist. Screenslaver, despite a clever title, is nothing remarkable and his promise is sort of squandered. There's a twist surrounding this villain that is quite foreseeable and the pay off isn't very memorable at all. In fact, the 'surprise villain' trope is getting very tired, especially in Disney. It was there in Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Zootopia, and Coco. GIVE IT A REST. On better terms, this allows the aforementioned family dynamic to shine more. The fact of the matter is: Screenslaver is no Syndrome, who was by all outward appearances a more interesting, outright adversary, and perhaps one of the Disney's greatest baddies. He was intelligent and charismatic, but also ruthlessly cruel and murderous; a loser who was motivated from years of jealousy and neglect. With that aside, I did enjoy the new characters. Bob Odenkirk of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fame really captured Winston Deavor's suave and idealistic charm, and I'm happy the actor is receiving more high profile work. The new band of superheroes that Elastigirl meets, despite their minimal screentime, are likable and serve an extravagant purpose during the climax. I must praise Michael Giacchino's musical score. It's jazzy, thematic, and exploding with adrenaline. Excellent range overall, his scores never disappoint. The animation, compared to the original film, has skyrocketed in quality. The character designs are more brisk and expressive, similar to Brad Bird's traditionally-animated masterpiece The Iron Giant, where many characters displayed a wide range of evocative reactions. There is one scene where Jack-Jack battles a raccoon, and the critter's movements are brilliantly animated. Snappy and comedic, yet not ignoring its natural, reactive behavior. The entire scene reminded me of a Chuck Jones cartoon, it was very slapstick but didn't feel out of place. Additionally, there's a scene where Violet encounters his crush Tony Rydinger at a restaurant and she sprays water out of her nose in surprise. Kinda gross in theory, but the exaggerated, cartoony expression on her face as it happened really sold the moment as pure comedy. It came out of nowhere and I was laughing hard, probably harder than I ever have in my history of seeing movies in the theater. I also appreciate how Tony Rydinger looks more boyish than he did in the original, almost resembling Hogarth Hughes from The Iron Giant. His look in the first film didn't seem right, he more resembled a man in his early 20s. Major props to the improved animation. It not only supported the action, but the humor as well.To conclude, Incredibles 2 is a mighty fine sequel. The family has a strong and amusing chemistry, and the action is fast-paced and stylish. It shows Brad Bird still carries a gift for telling effectively character-driven stories without sacrificing thrills. The only thing hampering the film down is its weak and predictable villain. It was great seeing these characters on the big screen again after 14 years. Suit up and prepare for an excellent blast to the past.",9,6,20,16 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Not much of an improvement over Prometheus...
","Alien: Covenant revives the helpless, gory thrills of the classic 1979 film, but its weak characterization and predictable story dumb it down from being anything more than a run–of–the–mill popcorn thriller. However, Michael Fassbender does a splendid job portraying two characters that share a substantial amount of screen time together.",6,1,3,17 November 2017
