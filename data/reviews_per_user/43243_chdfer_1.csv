Hereditary," Absolutely Terrifying
","The way this movie manages to consistently ramp up the the horror right up until the end is amazing, the framing of the shots are just amazing and scared me witless. I have never seen a horror movie that's managed to scare me so much I had to sleep with the lights on. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants crap themselves to sleep with a cross in hand.",9,2,3,28 February 2020
