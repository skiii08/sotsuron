Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Coming from Star Wars Virgin (saw it before originals)
","Alright, here goes; ONE: this movie was obviously meant for children but guess what? Children like `Cartoons' that's right just like The Mummy Returns, or whatever, too much concentration on an annoying little brat. TWO: Dear Hollywood, just because you have pretty picture scenery that's nice to stare at does not mean that you can forget about all else. THREE the whole idea of making a movie on the childhood of Dearth Vader was a good idea (just about the only) but for that there needs to be compelling character! As in, character development, as in Haley Joel Osment (the little guy would have been perfect). FOUR: all that was left after the movie was a feeling of coldness, which matched it very well. FIVE: it is not fair to have commercial merchandize in full swing before the d*** thing even comes out! SIX: I never really liked the original Sat Wars either, too cold. I give it two stars and they are for whoever drew up the lovely pictures for scenery that should have stayed two-dimensional! PS Jar Jar sucks, so many say ? He may have, I can't remember since every body else sucked as well did anyone actually LIKE this movie but a few brain melted kids?",2,0,1,30 July 2001
Unbreakable," How did this movie gat a 7.4!?
","Not very good at all. I really thought I would like this movie. All thought the movie I really tried to like it, but, ahhh! The idea is far fetched and irritating (as if someone was really straining to think up something). The plot was nonexistent. Untimely it was pointless. But, perhaps the most irritating thing about it was that it was one of the most boring and most unnecessarily stretched out movies I have ever seen. While, admittedly, not the worst movie I have ever seen, I would not give it more then a 4. What a disappointment! Please, please, please watch The Sixth Sense instead people!",Null,0,0,1 August 2001
Batman Returns," My be scratched with bad ratings, but what do they know?
","All Prepare to be shocked! To be insulted and astounded. I actually liked this one. That is right, I liked this one more then all the rest! So, what ya ganna do? Hah? Shoot me? And, to tell the trough, it seemed to me the first Batman movie just didn't work. It had too much of an oldie feel, and also, seems like the Batman movies are a lot better when there are two nasty blokes involved. I loved both the darkness and the shoreline in this one. Catwoman captivates and enthralls as a voluptuous bad girl and the Penguin is a sorry creature that one feels for. I greatly like when the supposed villain is not black and white bad but gray just like everyone in real life. I also think that the male/female combo on the dark side does wanders to make films better. I think the combination of bad girl and bad boy in each movie is a splendid one and works wanders. So, is this movie the best? I am inclined to say it is. I loved the beginning with Penguin and thought both his story and the Catwoman's could stand alone in quality. Also, I have a great liking for the funny little people that hung round Penguin. The fist one was new so it was loved immensely, but it was not that good. I do not believe that any movie after the first could have possibly measured up to it in most people's eyes. I, however, think it does true justice to Batman.",Null,0,0,21 October 2001
X-Men," X this one out of your list of must sees. C
","This peace of emptiness would have been alright if I simply went to the movie theater, happened to see it's poster, and went to see it (mind you, it would not be great, but would feel alright). As it was, I waited for it for three months. I read all about it and when I finally went it failed to satisfy. For one thing, the characters were no good. Where may I ask was Gambit, for example? Since when is Rogue a confused little girl? What happened to the voluptuous back talking woman? I would have preferred more concentration on Mystique since she was just about the only interesting character in this washed out rag. I sincerely hope Spiderman will be better (I do not have any hopes for the future X-Men2/3).",Null,0,1,22 October 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Lovely flick about a sick skirt... among other things.
","Though in plot somewhat different from the book in spirit it captured the written text supremely well. The characters, the humor, the comedy of the situations that charmed us all in the book are all present. And, although I must admit after being dragged to it for the third time I was a wee bit sick of it, still, it brought much enjoyment and pleasure. What a nice change Bridget is from the ever present popsy pretty Barbie dolls that America always has to stick into their romantic comedies. How wonderful to hear for once some snappy conversations rather then the ever flat usual burble. And finally, how nice to see real characters and people rather then washed out dolls ( I know I mentioned that before. but it's worth mentioning again). All in all, a true romantic comedy worth watching, and in very close spirit to the book.",Null,1,1,10 October 2001
American Pie," Reeking stupidity of the lowest class.
","In this popular story on sexual frustrations of teenagers there are no really whitty lines, no interesting, unique, or intricate characters, no real plot to speak of. No artistic directing. What there is is a bunch of cheep laughs gained by totally stupid activities. Even the supposed perversities are not all that perverse. Those who will like it already know they will like it before they saw it. In my believe if there is a straining for the mindless idiotic laugh Â‘tis altogether better to skip it and watch Scary Movie instead, which, at least, presents some amusing parodies.",2,6,15,30 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Slow as the feloship's journy.
","Let me start by saying that I never liked the book Lord of the Rings. Happy memories entwine me from when I was about 12 and would sit and draw while listening to The Hobbit. The Hobbit was ingenious and clever, while Lord of the Rings felt like a dreary old history book. Now we come to the movie, what can I say? I saw it in the theaters the first week it came out. Did I like it? This is not the question; more precisely let me state that, yes, it did, so far as I could tell, follow the book, perhaps not only that, but it had the feel of the book. It flowed as the book does, and it was every bit as boring. Just as in the book it started out charmingly with the little Hobbit village, quivered on the edge of being intriguing for a moment, but soon wound its way into a tireless sickle of attacks, runs, and frustratingly predictable sentimentality. Yes I fidgeted and yawned, but finally gathered myself to sit though and enjoy, just as the movie uncompromisingly, frustratingly, ended. So this is one idea I propose. PUT A STOP TO MULTI PART MOVIES!!! Yes I can understand making a movie that is complete in of itself, it has a beginning and and end, such as Star Wars episode one, yet you know there are three coming up, but The Lord of the Rings did not even have the climax in the movie, all it had was the meat usually found in the second third of the book. As sorry I am to say, even the nice effects did not make this movie more then just another average; that could have waited for my home screen.",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
Van Helsing," This scared me.
","You know how big budget American movies have this reputation of being bad (due to badly contrived plots, bad unrealistic affects, generic hero/heroin, obvious ending, eye candy that isn't all that sweet) yah that's the kind. Well this movie, let me tell you, is the KING of all the movies with that stereotype. Let me explain something first of all, this is NOT a review of Van Hellsing, maybe, one day, when I have nothing better to do I'll write one, today is not the day, however. Today is the day when I will simply say this is quite possibly the worst big budget action movie of its genre. The guy who did this was famous for the Mummy. Personally I feel the Mummy was good (ok, so the second was bad but still) THIS, however well let's put it this way, the first 5 min are good. The second color filters into the movie it goes downhill. And just when it hits the bottom and you know it can't get worse, it starts borrowing into the ground to get even lower. I would like to also stress that this movie has more plot holes that I noticed (upon one viewing only I might add) then all other movies I have ever seen (and I'v seen a lot) that, right there, should say something.",1,0,1,7 May 2004
Spider-Man," Weave yourself into a comfy web and enjoy.
","Spiderman Spider man; a true comic book hero brought to life. A movie that delivers the action but does not take itself too seriously while it's at it. Where cheesy love lines and predictable action sequences are enjoyable and awaited rather then shunned. One problem I have with many modern superhero movies is that they totally lose the idea of `kid entertainment brought to life' and instead try to pull off some sort of Matrix. This is one of the problems I found in X Men. It took itself excessively seriously. There was absolutely no hummer in the movie what so ever. Where humor was to be expected one found heavy drama. Spiderman, on the other hand, felt like a cartoon, just with real people. The fake look of the Green Goblin was amusing, as was the swing of the `human spider' from building to towering building. This is for those Spiderman fans out there, the new and the old, this is NOT for someone in love with Blade II; they would probably do better with The Scorpion King. Know who you are and do not complain about this movie if you would not be caught dead watching the cartoon or reading the comics. The one comment I have is that it failed to explain what powers the Green Goblin had or how the second spider costume came about, other then that, the movie satisfied me perfectly.",9,0,0,10 June 2002

","I cannot believe as many people liked it as is. This movie was ... beyond believe bad. Perhaps it is my total dislike for zombie movies ... perhaps it was not, but... STOP MAKING BAD MOVIES HOLLYWOOD! thinks that were wrong 1) the action took place in totally uninteresting places.. At least make it pretty!!! old mansion. HALLO! 2)um. plot? is it there.. um. ok by the end it lurks around the corner. try having it in sooner 3) what the HELL is going on (my only thought the first hour 45 min) 4)ok so the filming was done well but what are they filming...(remember to get make up tips from 13 Ghosts next time) 5) the ending was quite cool except for the fact that it's only there to provide a bridge for the next Resident Evil movie which... what do you know!... is coming out in 2003 no less!",4,0,0,31 July 2002
Batman Begins," Batman Begins the worst 'comic book' movie i have seen in a long time.
","A movie that tries to take comic book films to a new level. It tells the story of the birth of Batman and the beginning of all that which, with time, becomes essential for the batman legend; the bat cave, Archam, Commisionar Gordon, so on. The problem, in my mind, (although, to so many people this is the strength) is that the movie completely lacks the comic book flair. In my mind comic book movies should not be made as realistic as possible. There is no need for the Batman that we love to do marital arts training in some far off land to add 'respectability' to the movie. Someone commented that with this film 'Comic-book films grow up at last' but why the hell should they be growing up? The batman comic book is nothing like the Lord of the Rings trilogy and there is no reason to apply the same movie making formula to it. (you know, the formula; make it take itself seriously + add in 'good' character development + good acting + make sure there isn't too much action + take everything from the fantastical to the 'down to earth') And why does this formula work oh so well? Let me tell you why, because the Snobs of America feel this is what our 'shallow' cinema 'needs' to make itself more respectable, because they can come out of the movie feeling good about themselves for enjoying it. Sin City, the only comic book movie I can think of that literally was the comic book but in movie form, it worked. Daredevil which so many people found distasteful, was a perfectly fine movie based on a comic book. The characters were unrealistic, over the top, and it had an unrealistic artistic style that Batman Begins sacrificed for realism. Comic books are not just stories they are works of art! They are COMICS Some comics are serious, yes, like say, Watchmen, but this does not apply to superhero comics. Want to see a good Batman movie? Go see the first two that were ever made. Sure the characters were different, the story a bit off, but that doesn't matter, it was 'batman'. This? This was an action flick masquerading behind the bat mask. The only redeeming feature of this movie I could think of was the Scarecrow, but even he was confined to realism and hardly developed.",5,2,5,9 July 2005
Velvet Goldmine," I wish there was something higher then a 10 to give here!
","I have by now watched this movie about seven times all the way though, and many parts over 20 times. I have seen it by far more then any other movie. I know every detail, every word, and every gesture. Yet, I feel as though I missed something because some people think Jonathan Rhys Meyers acted badly! Perhaps some thought his acting was a bit cold and icy, well, hallo! He is playing a rock star that is unreal what do you think he is going to act like?! Also, for some reason, everyone just loves Ewan in this movie, but I still have not seen anything all that wonderful, sure, he plays a grunge rock star who likes to jump up and down with temper and be insulting, while really he turns out to be an ok guy after all. But from the reserved Brian Shade I felt so much more. He reminded me of an innocent, a bit confused, a bit unloyal  youngster that gets dragged into star life through his constant searching for his cattle of fish. The whole time he feels rather more innocent and unsuspecting then the rest of the characters. Having gotten that off of my chest. I must also comment on another opinion. Some people fancy that the script was flat and shallow. Actually much of the movie was actually in quotes, (many Oscar Wilde's). I think it was anything but shallow for every time anyone spoke they said something that immediately I found myself questioning and pondering over. Overall, this should not be treated as much as a move with a plot and regular characters living out a fragment of life, as a musical/music video that is very beautifully done, but with content and meaning. Or perhaps as a surreal love story? You will either hate this movie and simply not understand it, or you will adore it and it will become as religion touching your life deeply. And, yes, what ever remains of a plot is rather hard to interpret at times and I only understood everything after the third or fourth time I watched it. Over all, try not to think of this as necessarily the 70s but more as a surreal world, ageless, and reflecting our own. Allow me to sum up; excellent actors, superior script, beautifully directed, wonderful music, very artistic and colorful, you may love it, you may hate it, you probably will not forget it.",10,6,9,10 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Worth dancing over
","SPOILER ALERT Moulin Rouge; where the old and rich go to dance with the young and the beautiful. Well, perhaps, not all so very young, and not all beautiful, but wild looking in any case. That, which starts with the drawing of the red curtain, soon turns into a swirl of skirts and colored doll faces as Christian enters that wild sacred realm. At first the unsuspecting audience is sure to feel much of the same confusion as the poetical hero. Peeping colored faces poking out of a hole in the ceiling; sexy green fairies; clowns; a hyperactive short guy; a hyperactive tall mean guy; a hyperactive pimp stile boss; some hyperactive swirls of skirt. Hyperactive faces; hyperactive redhead making love to a blanket; hyperrrr r  r And just when one thought the movie would swirl away into oblivion till the end all slows down and tis time for a love song, and then another, and then the story is on. Does the hyperactiveness return, by all means, but by that time one is ready for it and does not feel like they are hit on the head continually with a diamond covered gold bat. Now We break it down.Story- is very unoriginal, the most unoriginal element about all of this movie, in fact. (possible spoiler) Boy meets girl, boy and girl from different ends of the meat rack of life, boy loves girl, girl loves boy, another boy loves girl who is from her side of the meat rack, girl chooses love boy number 1, something happens to make girl choose the other nasty bad boy but does not tell our hero why she does. Girl inevitably chooses hero boy and they live happily ever after, ups... Well, no, actually this is the other variation where the girl dies and the boy lives on to tell about it (think Titanic). Obviously, the movie is a love story plain and simple like many others, so what is special about this one? Filming/art- is absolutely exquisite. The hyperactiveness defiantly works to catch one's attention even if one hates it all along they are sure to be windswept by it. Wonderful effects such as the black and whitish beginning that all of a sudden gains color. The life is like oxygen speech comes on and Ups! Confused face on Christian, guy drops though roof, it turns into a comedy of sorts! All this being very very well filmed the whole wile. Alright, so, when it does slow down by the end, say, after the tango scene, (SPOILER) one starts to think to oneself, alright, die already. Let me just tell you, Satine does not die until it is obvious she is going to, so do not fight! But, enough of that. Music: is very very nicely put together. Moulin Rouge seems to capture within itself all the popular music of the 20th century and mixes it up within each other to present it in a surprisingly tasteful blend. Some songs are especially amusing to listen to for they surely parody the original (ahm, Like a Virgin). Verdict? Even though the plot is not original, the love plot never is. Simply put, this movie did all it possibly could have out of a very obvious plot line, both where acting was concerned, artistically, and in filming, they even mixed in a little comedy which was a big surprise to myself. If you like colorful swirling movies, watch it, If you are a very old couple walking on stilts between mortality and death and get a heart attack at the drop of a hat (or the throw of a hat) stay away from this one and continue with the every day Days Of Our Lives.",9,0,0,26 August 2001
Titanic," Will sink some hearts, and bury others.
","I have set it upon myself to write this review to tell the trough about Titanic. To expose its number one weakness so that it no longer be confused with any others. Why do so many hate this movie and are ready to swear that it is one of the worst ever made? Perhaps they should expose their eyes to everyday movies more often if they speak thus. Let us examine the movie. The acting, while not all that brilliant, is sufficient for the parts to come through honestly enough. The dialogue, while not the greatest or deepest is appropriate and, let's face it, in view of what comes out now a days, quite descent. The length of the movie may be long but is, I feel, necessary and the movie does hold attention with ought becoming a bore. The special effects are, no one can dispute, magnificent, and the costumes realistic. So what is so incredibly bad about this movie? It is alright. It is, in fact, better then alright. It is a rather darn good movie about love with a historical background. The biggest weakness of this movie is that rather then being viewed as pretty dang good, it was rather viewed as the best thing ever created by man or god. As history shows when something is overrated a lot of people start to boo it for being unworthy, and thus call it total crap.",8,1,3,10 October 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," At a bit of a loss.
","How to put this, some parts to this movie were incredibly good, while others plain stank. Shall I be positive and start with the good? Yes. From the very flashback beginning, (I have a personal affection for movies with flashbacks) I was captivated, and when seeing the mad who was he again in his cell, rising from the ground all surreal I was practically jumping up and down with excitement. Then came the blow. Keanu Reeves has got to be one of the most overrated actors out there, him and Arnold Shwartznager (sorry if I killed that because I always call him `Shwartzy'). Not only was his face a stone in this movie, like in any other, but his forced, horrible British accent just plain well, come one now, even I could do a British accent better (and I am not saying I am any good at it)! All the other actors were marvelous, especially I enjoyed Hopkins and Ryder. A lot of the art was wonderful in it also such as all the scenes with the Vampire brides and the flowing gowns in the night. Some, however, were rather cheesy such as blood coming from both sides of the screen and green smokeI mean, this just kills the mystical experience of the movie when you have special effects such as that. It makes it feel like some sort of cheep horror flick, and not a good one. The constant show of red blood cells also was a bit too technical and unmystical to be shown, I thought. What should have been done was to have the blood trickle like little snaky rivers over and around things (much more subtle that way), and the smoke to be black rather then that pop green. Perhaps subtleties was another good word to use, the movie lacked it. I would have preferred it more of a drama and less of horror such as Interview With The Vampire. Dracula himself was often portrayed a bit too obviously scary, it would have been better, I thought, had he looked more normal yet had some subtle chilly notes about him. The moving by itself carriage and all such was also a bit too `evil witch of the west'ish. So while some parts of the movie I thought to be exquisite, others I just had to shake my head at. It was almost sad because it could have been a truly wonderful movie had some parts not been there, but with them I would give it (with sadness) a 6.5/10.",7,0,0,4 August 2001
Shrek," Not bad, but not skreking with exitement.
","Oh my god! This movie is so funny I can't stand it! Ha ha ha, no I really can't. I am laughing so hard I am going to burst me tummy, really I am! Ha ha ha haha ahm. Really people, reading all those reviews you'd think this movie came with a hand that stretched out of the screen and literally tickled the audience. Well, I have to give it to them, the idea of this backward movie was cute, predictable, but still cute. But it was not THAT funny. It was, of course, here and there and everywhere, but I can think of just a couple movies that are funnier. When I say fun I mean in your face screaming at you sort of fun that you can't help but notice, not the delicate, or sarcastic, or witty sort of fun that sinks deeper. In other words this movie is just the sort that will gather attention world wide and, surely, success. If you see the cover, you can bet you know if you like it's sort, and if you like anything like it, then watch it at least once. If you have a big disgust for American comedies, stay away.",Null,0,0,30 August 2001

","Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a big f*****g television, choose washing machines, cars, compact disk players and electrical tin openers... choose DIY and wondering who the f**k you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on the couch, watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, f****d-up brats you spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life. Choose to write a review about a seriously unique movie, but why do a thing like that? This is the Scottish equivalence to SLC Punk. The two are very much alike. Both seem to be serious, but both end up being hilarious the whole while. In Trainspotting the Scottish accent surely helped to add amusement as well as the amusing little characters that liter the movie. Here is the basic lot. POSIBLE SPOILERS Well there is Renton who is a hopeless heroin addict who gets stuck in the worst toilet in Scotland, that would, by the way, be the main guy. There is Sick Boy who everyone calls Sick Boy because he is, well, sick. There is Begbie who everyone is afraid off because he is the sort of person who will bite your head off for brushing up against him in a crowded pub. There is also Diane who's choice wardrobe for success is moderately skimpy little dress and a school girl outfit. There is also Spud who's brains one finds themselves pondering over and Tommy who is all good and proper but ends up dyeing (must not be hard enough for the tough existence). So there's the gang, and this gang goes on an adventure of sorts all though which Renton can not make up his mind whether to `choose life' or `choose heroin'. When he chooses, keep in mind, it is not necessarily final.
