Marie Antoinette," How do you make a movie that should end in decapitation this boring?
","Marie Antoinette is Sofia Coppola's attempt to make Marie Antoinette seem less like a spoiled bitch and more like a poor little girl trapped in aristocracy. The movie follows Marie Antoinette as she's forced to marry Louis XVI; a loveless marriage and what's worse he doesn't even want to have sex with her. At least an hour of the movie involves Marie Antoinette trying to get knocked up but her husband just won't notice her. After she finally does push out a kid the rest of the movie just involves lots of parties and scenes of Marie Antoinette in fields. I could never really get lost in the history of the since the soundtrack is made up of a bunch of crappy modern rock songs somewhat similar to A Knight's Tale and half of most of the actors were too recognizable and felt out of place (I mean Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI). The movie is gorgeous, all of the costumes and the scenery look great unfortunately the rest of the movie is bogged down by unnecessary crap.",4,0,1,17 February 2007
