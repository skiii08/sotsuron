Requiem for a Dream," we want movies to affect us, don´t we?
","I saw this one at the Stockholm Film Festival 4 days ago. It was like getting a hard punch in the stomach. And I have seen my fair share of tough movies. When I left the cinema, I saw a woman leaning against the wall, crying her eyes out. Not since SEVEN have I seen a movie with this visceral impact. The  accelerating cross-cut montage is disturbing and powerful, the music pumping, the hypnotic beat, sneaking up on you, trapping you in a vice, a spiral descent into hell, each turn faster, narrower. I felt Darronofsky was close to showing-off, and I gave it a 3 out of 5 on the card afterwards. If someone aims a punch at you, you react by raising your guard. But after all, we want movies to affect us, don´t we? This one has stayed in my mind for days afterwards, I can´t wait to watch it again. Even if it isn´t always a pleasant experience. A very strong movie, not for the squeamish, and now, after digesting it, I´ll rate it 4.",Null,0,0,17 November 2000
United 93," Gut-wrenching
","Greengrass has made all the right choices in this production, unknown actors, naturalistic, a documentary feel, understated use of music (allthough he could have done without a score completely). The result is an absolutely riveting, edge of your seat movie. The editing is superb, and you get a gut-wrenching feel for the passengers and their reality inside that plane that day. The whole event seems to be played out in real-time, and also include the actual traffic control chief who was working that day. A very authentic feel throughout, despite my minor objection about using a music score. The extras on the DVD, which include the actors meeting the families of the victims, are deeply moving. A must-see movie.",8,2,3,31 January 2007
Minority Report," best movie Spielberg has made in a long time
","Quite a pleasant surprise. This is the best movie Spielberg hasmade in a long time and it succeeds where AI miserably failed. Inthis case the story is intriguing, performances believable, the setdesigns convincing. The cinematography is beautiful, gritty anddesaturated. The expected Spielberg sentimentality is also verymuch toned down, though not completely absent unfortunately. Itmay loose momentum a bit towards the end, but that is a minorproblem. It is also nice to hear a John Williams score which ismore atonal and minimalistic. Franks script is a very goodadaptation of Dick´s short story, it keeps his tone and has niceideas added to the basic concept while not straying too far from it,even though the final minute may seem a bit too upbeat. Everyoneinvolved seems to be in top form, very good work indeed.",Null,0,0,24 May 2003
Se7en," One of the best movies of the 90s
","I can´t believe I haven´t commented on this film earlier. This is filmmaking of the highest order. A superb script wonderfully realized. I hope Fincher can maintain the high standards he has set for himself here. A future filmmaker can learn a lot from this movie, just in terms of pacing. The way it shifts into high gear is masterful, and it´s refreshing to find a director nowadays who knows when and how to move the camera for maximum dramatic effect. Howard Shore´s fine score is unobtrusive and used only when needed. Photography, editing, acting- top notch, and I thought Brad Pitt was just a Hollywood pretty boy, how wrong was I? I understand the producers wanted a more upbeat ending, and that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deserves credit for helping Fincher convince them not to change anything. As we approach the end of the millenium, this is one movie who stands tall above the vast sea of forgettable Hollywood movies of the 90s.",10,0,0,15 August 1999
Memento," one of the best this year
","I will make this short, I have problems with long reviews. I urge everyone to see this movie, itÂ´s one of the best this year so far. It is a very good idea very well executed in every concievable way (well, the music is good but could have been better without the synth-strings). Guy Pearce is amazing, as he was in LA Confidential, I hope he continues to choose good projects like this. It is thought-provoking and fascinating all the way to the end. Nolan is a true talent, I have high hopes. Go see.",Null,0,1,23 August 2001
12 Monkeys," I would love to see him adapt something by Philip K. Dick
","Without a doubt one of Gilliam finest moments. A perfect vehicle for him, although he did not write it himself. He manages to inject it with his own trademark quirkiness and idiosyncrasies without losing focus, as he have done in the past. Here he has, as in Fisher King, a strong script to work from. He is utterly unlike any other director out there, balancing the melancholy drama and black comedy elements with great skill. I remember being blown away by the first scene with Brad, what a total transformation! I hardly recognized him, and to be able to do what he does here is a sign of a serious hard-working actor. The intricate story lends itself well to multiple viewings, and I have returned to this film many times since 1996, and I probably will continue to do so. The score is also remarkably original for a Hollywood production. At first Piazollas accordion may seem to be a too bold a move, but it soon becomes clear that it works beautifully. The rest of Paul Buckmasters score is also right on the money. Now I would love to see Gilliam adapt something by Philip K. Dick. In retrospect, this is one of the top ten movies of the nineties, and continues to be high on my all-time top ten SF movie-list.",10,1,1,17 April 2007
Hostel," Lacking of atmosphere and tension
","Just seen this turkey...nothing new. Completely lacking of atmosphere and tension, despite the graphic violence, which, by the way, is too much old-school make-up artistry to have impact. If it had been combined with computer graphics in a way similar to Irreversible, it could have. At the end the movie totally looses focus and relies on way too many convenient solutions. It is interesting that despite exteriors being shot on location, it all seems sanitized and artificial. Maybe because the cinematography is too...looking for the proper word...rigid, safe? Everything is over-lit, except for the 'dungeon', which is too horror-stylized. A more documentary approach would probably have been more effective, as if it was being shot by one of the backpackers themselves. And this makes millions at the box-office, I guess there is something to be learned from that. Make a lackluster movie with some nudity and gore, make money. I have longed for horror movies to be scary and bloody again, like in the 70s and 80s, but I can live without this. Eli, I think you can do better than this, I hope your next movie has more substance and imagination, Hostel plays it too safe by trying too hard to be controversial.",1,2,3,21 April 2006
L.A. Confidential," Brilliant
","I agree with many other comments here, this is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90s. I will never forget the joy of watching it for the first time (on tape) and being completely blown away, I was actually jumping out of my chair. The acting, the plot twists, Goldsmiths music. Everything was completely dead on target. Who would have expected this stroke of genius from Curtis Hanson? An absolute masterpiece, sometimes movies this good actually gets made in Hollywood.",10,1,1,15 March 2000
Match Point," An absorbing drama
","A real return to form for Woody. An absorbing drama, great acting and beautiful cinematography. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers reminds me of a young Malcolm McDowell, he has a intriguing and intense face, and acting skills to match. One could say that its a variation on Martin Landaus plot line in Crimes and Misdemeanors. Match Point is one of those Allen-films were you are not missing the comedy, and it works very well as a drama/thriller. Some small dialog things might feel a bit out of date (Nola: 'I need a drink', Chris: 'This way'). I sense that directing sex-scenes is not Allens forte, and they are mercifully brief but makes their point. Maybe the policemen near the end are a bit broad in this serious context, but those minor things aside, this is a compelling movie. My theory that directors past their sixties has their best work behind them, is subverted here. Hopefully we have more great films to expect from Woody.",8,0,2,12 August 2006
The Prestige," Wonderfully dark and tense atmosphere (Possible spoilers)
","Cristopher Nolan does it again! He is definitely someone to watch in the future. In THE PRESTIGE he creates a wonderfully dark and tense atmosphere, thanks to excellent use of music and superb cinematography and set design. There is hardly any day exteriors at all. The approach of scrambling the continuity works fine here and makes you pay extra attention, soon it will become such an often used device that audiences probably wont even notice. The acting is overall uniformly excellent, Michael Caine stands out as a center of gravity for the plot and the rest of the ensemble. Even David Bowie has improved his acting with age, and now also has great authority and weight, he hardly registers as 'Bowie' at all. What you will make of the payoff is probably very individual, I thought it fitted the slightly surreal and dreamlike ambiance the rest of the movie had. The cinematography, as I mentioned, is stunning. It must have been an ordeal for the focus puller, since it is anamorphic, mostly hand-held, and often shot in under-lit locations.",8,0,0,4 May 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Burton could employ the 'less is more'-approach
","This is a very fine film with wonderful visuals and acting. It´s nice to see a period horror film with this level of budget and attention to detail. But since viewing it for the second time on DVD, I´m a little less impressed. Though it is a homage to Hammer-style movies, Burton doesn´t quite manage to convey the suspense and true dread of many of those movies. He is very close but I sense something missing. Perhaps it is a bit too calculated. Elfmans score is generally fine, but used in too many scenes. I find it to be a bit monotonously orchestrated, the sound is always big, lacking contrast. It´s as if both Elfman and Burton could employ the 'less is more'-approach. The first scene with the headless horseman could for instance have been dropped, saving his appearance for later. But these quibbles aside, it is a entertaining movie with top actors in fine form.",Null,0,1,25 July 2001
Silent Hill," nice, creepy atmosphere
","One of the better horror films for a while. It has a nice, creepy atmosphere, an effective music score which adds character. Nice touch to keep it electronic, makes a change from the typical orchestral sound. The film holds up well for the first hour fifteen minutes, then the plot starts to get a little more convoluted for its own good, and the ending just adds layers of more confusing stuff on top of what has come before. Some things do not need to be explained, and when the explanation just makes everything more confusing, better to leave it alone. These faults aside, it is a well made and atmospheric film which brings back fond memories of the good old 80s, when one first encountered Carpenter, Phantasm, Hellraiser and From Beyond. The focus here is more on the dense atmosphere of the decaying environments than cheap shock scares, which is very welcome. I actually came to think of Orson Welles The Trial, which has a similar surrealistic journey through a nightmarish and decayed world, and can also be described as a horror film in a way.",6,0,0,14 November 2006
Cast Away," OK, but with a script by JG Ballard it could´ve been great
","Quite interesting and engaging despite som cliched moments. The psychology of Hanks character is quite shallow and traditional, I wanted to know more, about his thoughts and dreams beyond merely wanting to return to civilization. I wish the script could have been written by JG Ballard. The plane crash is spectacular, as is some of the panoramas of the island, and I like Zemeckis restrained use of music. I think there´s no score for nearly 90 min, which is really nice in a Hollywood movie. But when it does surface, it is of course the same romantic nonsense we´ve heard a million times before. Despite that, the ending was better  than I expected and it has a quite nice epilogue.",Null,0,0,27 August 2001
The Thing," Carpenters finest movie
","I regard this one as John Carpenters finest movie. It has been sad to see his decline in recent years. In the mouth of madness had its few moments, but The village of the damned was a worthless piece of s--t. Luckily one can always watch The Thing again, and it certainly a worthwhile experience - especially in widescreen. The surreal imagery hold up remarkably well - one of the best special-effects work ever in the history of horror-movies. Fine performances overall, the photography is outstanding, and one detail is very refreshing - the sparingly used music, I´m sure many scenes would have been overscored, if it had been done today. The Thing itself is a wonderful creation, a movie-monster which never shows its true form, and leaves you guessing as to what shape it originally had. And I love the unsentimental ending.",Null,0,1,30 May 2000
The Shining," A cinematic milestone
","This is a remarkable milestone in cinema. Kubrick has created a timeless horror masterpiece that puts recent genre movies to shame, and one that many directors should do well to study closely. It still hasn´t really been equalled. You are completely absorbed into the environment of the Overlook Hotel, thanks to the superb camera-work, scenography (It was entirely built on a soundstage), acting, and very importantly - the use of contemporary classical music. The blood-spewing elevator accompanied by Pendereckis 'The Dream of Jacob' is an absolute masterstroke, one you´ll never forget. Kubrick´s adaption of the book has been critizised but I believe he actually made it better. It´s more abstract than Kings original story but all the more scary because of it.",10,1,1,11 October 1998
The Exorcist," One of the all time best horror movies
","Forget the Screams, I know what you...and Urban Legends flooding the market today, this is the real stuff, this is true moviemaking by a director with control of the medium. This movie had a strong impact on me when I saw it many years ago, and I can still watch it with great reward today. The sad thing is that you realize how hard it would be to make a movie like this within the Hollywood system today, where the chills and thrills should be presented in full force from beginning to end, leaving no room for ambiguity and character development. Friedkins choice of a documentary approach to the material works brilliantly, and the deliberate pacing, the orchestration of the buildup to the horrific scenes, is masterful, as is the subtle use of music and sound effects. Something that should be studied by all serious moviemakers working today. It´s sad that Friedkin´s made a lot of unspectacular movies after this one, but I guess he has had a hard time working within a Hollywood system in which the standards of storytelling has gradually been lowered.",9,1,2,24 February 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Should have been a masterpiece
","Despite the brilliance of the war-scenes, and they are truly amazing, this movie still has too many 'Spielberg'- moments. For me, the film is stylistically schizophrenic, he should have used the documentary-style all the way through. Now he falls between two chairs, making the movie feel disjointed and unbalanced. What irritates me is that he could and should have been more consistent in tone, he of all directors certainly could afford more experimentation. Now it has moments of genius, and moments of cheesy standard Spielberg-sentimentality, and a paradoxical pro-war message: war makes you grow as a person. Very good performances (but a questionable Matt Damon) and striking photography and sound, but unfortunately not as good as it should have been.",4,0,1,31 January 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," I try to watch it at least once a year.
","What more can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? I'll try to throw in my two cents. I rate it as one of the best movies in all of cinema history. It is not only a mind-boggling technological achievement, but also an artistic milestone. I watched it at age 10, in a small, empty theater, and I continued to live inside it for weeks afterwards. I didn't understand it, but it was an epic experience unlike any other. It is a cinematic environment, for the viewer to inhabit, more than a plot-driven movie. It is as far as I know, the only multi-million dollar movie that truly challenges the viewer, redefines the medium, and dares asking us to fill in the blanks. It will probably remain as unique as it is, in view of the current production climate. Much has been said about the wooden acting of Lockwood and Dullea, but I feel it is just as easy to symphatize with them, if not more-so, than if they had been more traditional movie 'heroes'. It is easier to project oneself on the blank canvas of Dulleas face and ride along with him to the end, when there is no movie 'personality' to like or dislike. For insights into the production, I recommend reading 'The Making of 2001' and '2001 - Filming the Future'. The amount of attention to detail and man-hours put into this film is truly astounding. A whole staff spent countless hours handpainting the mattes, a link in the chain towards the goal to expose all effect shots upon a single master, for maximum picture quality. The front-projection technique used for the opening scenes is another mammoth achievement. I try to watch it at least once a year.",10,1,3,25 August 2006
From Hell," a very tough, realistic and unflinching tale
","I wasn´t expecting this to be very good, in fact I expected an over-stylized Hollywood version of Alan Moore´s great and horrific Ripper-tale. The Hughes brothers previous DEAD PRESIDENTS, I found to be overlong, overexplicit and illogic. So I was (un)pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a very tough, realistic and unflinching tale. Not since SE7EN, have I squirmed in my seat so much. What´s impressive is among other things, Peter Demings cinematography and the brilliant sets which really transports you back in time. The stylized visions and scene transitions work very well and never become overly flashy. I also didn´t find Johnny Depps Cockney-accent irritating, which I also was expecting, he´s done another great role here. As for Heather Graham, she´s been criticized of being too pretty for this part, and maybe that´s true, but on the other hand, wouldn´t it have been just as unrealistic if every prostitute of that time was ugly-lookin´? Very effective score and sound design also. This is the best work of the Hughes Brothers thus far. A nice touch was also the very 'unflashy' main titles.",Null,1,2,4 June 2002
Total Recall," Most effective during the Philip K. Dick moments
","I remember this one wholesale and quite fondly. Re-watching it now, I still think the environments and technologies are lacking, as I did the first time I saw it. Verhoeven is more concerned with carnage and action than setting up a believable futuristic environment. Most of the sets seem to just what they are: movie sets. Especially when the story switches to Mars the milieu never becomes credible. Aside from that, the action is generally impeccable, the Goldsmith score suitably majestic and bombastic. I love Michael Ironside but sadly he haven't got much to do here, besides sneering and looking tough. The most effective moments though are the Philip K. Dick moments, when the reality of what is going on is questioned. It gives the movie a certain intriguing tension that ordinary action flick lack, and lifts it up slightly above a ordinary popcorn movie. I would really like to read the discarded Cronenberg script, he worked for a year on the adaptation before stepping down. I guess the producers were trying to emphasize the action elements too much for his taste. If my memory implants are correct I also recall how awkward and uncomfortable Arnold seemed, especially in the opening scenes, and drawing huge laughs from the audience.",6,0,2,29 March 2009
Mystic River," Watchable but nothing extraordinary
","(minor spoilers) Tim Robbins gives a great performance. Sean Penn is good but not exceptional. The rest of the cast is solid. It has a nice, dark cinematography and good pacing. What bothers me is some story elements and some of Eastwoods directing. The whole device of Bacons characters wife calling him up and being silent on the line, feels strained and awkward. And I'm getting allergic to closeups with slow zooms, here designed to let Penn show his chops. (The whole dialogue on the porch with Robbins and Penn could have played better as a two-shot.) One can feel Eastwood trying to stay away from the most blatant sentimentality, but he doesn't take it all the way, in my opinion. This is still too much 'Hollywood' for it to have effect on me. Watchable but nothing extraordinary.",Null,0,0,18 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Manages to engage both the mind and the eye
","This is the best one of the new trilogy, without a doubt. The acting is better and there are even some welcome moments of slower pacing which adds to the overall dynamic and allows breathing space. This is very much needed since the action is relentless, and even becomes a bit too repetitious after a while, its one cliffhanger after another. Some of these action scenes are also a bit too cluttered, and makes me long for the cleaner style in the first trilogy. Every frame tends to become overloaded. These criticisms aside, it is still the best looking one of the new trilogy. The movie improves towards the end and ultimately manages to engage both the mind and the eye. And Yoda kicks ass!",8,1,2,18 May 2005
Vanilla Sky," overlong and dull
","Decided to give this one a chance, even though I never had high expectations. Amenabars version was an intriguing reality-warping thriller, that was very effective. Unfortunately and not surprisingly, these qualities have not survived the Hollywoodization. Besides beeing overlong and dull, Crowe effectively kills the potential tension by layering pop songs over virtually every scene. He should stay away from the thriller genre in the future, and continue with character-driven ensemble pieces. The DVD has a interesting 'behind the scenes'-look at the promo tour. Crowe meets Amenabar at a party in Spain, and I can sense what goes through Amenabars head. Something like: 'You Hollywood-big shot, who remade my movie into a piece of s**t, go back to where you came from and take this overblown promotional circus with you...'",Null,0,1,7 September 2003
Blade Runner," Never been equalled
","Many have praised this one before me, so I will try to keep my comment brief. One of the few movies which still towers majestically over the majority of SF-movies produced before or since. I rate this, along with 2001 and Solaris, as masterpieces of cinema which take the medium to another level. Funny that there are three SF-movies on my top ten movies of all time. In this age of CGI, the environment created for this film has still never been equalled. It is not just the intense layering and detail, it is also the pace which we move through the environment that is just as important. Allowing us time to rest and contemplate the surroundings, along with the magnificent music, brings out so much more atmosphere and sense of place. The acting is interesting, mixing low-key realism with the highly theatrical style of Hauer and Turkel. Yet that mixing never feels out of place. Also, the important ingredient Ridley has in BR that has been lacking in some of his subsequent efforts, is a rich, multi-levelled story. The existential aspects, what is human, real versus artificial memories, the unanswered questions. Almost all movies I consider to be masterpieces have an unanswered question at the end and which brings me back for subsequent watchings. This is one of them. May it soon appear on a Special Ed. DVD with tons of extras.",10,6,10,7 December 2006
