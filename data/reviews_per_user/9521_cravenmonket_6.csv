Scarface," Brian de Palma's Masterpiece
","Scarface throbs with sleazy eighties energy which is repulsive and compelling. Brain de Palma created a masterpiece with this powerhouse remake of the Jimmy Cagney original, and it stands tall alongside The Godfather as an epic, empirical tragedy.I have never seen Al Pacino play any role that comes close to the power of Tony Montana. Even his magnificent portrayals of Michael Corleone are little more than a warm-up to this. Put simply, he pulls off the greatest performance of his career.Watching Tony Montana go from nervous, edgy firecracker to ambition-fuelled rising star to frenzied burn-out is an exhausting ride, but worth the two and a half hours. He literally fills every scene with trembling, pent-up fury. You can forget about the excellent support he gets (including a wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer), you cannot take your eyes off Pacino.De Palma's direction takes in an oversize, glitzy, tacky early eighties Miami and makes it the kingdom of power and sleaze that Tony Montana sees as the good-life. He constructs a plastic and neon empire around him, and covers everything in a fine layer of uncut cocaine.Best bits? The acutely tense club scenes, the chainsaw drug-deal, the riot at the beginning and of course the astonishing last 15 minutes. Really, though, there is nothing I can think of that is lacking here.Emphatically one of the most powerful movies ever made. Puts all subsequent drug movies in the shade. Makes Blow look like Zoolander. Utterly, utterly unmissable.",Null,0,1,14 June 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Tasteless, sensational, self-consciously unglamourous film.
","I can't imagine anyone will leave this film without feeling something. I watched it with my wife and, by the end, I wanted to be sick. I loved Aronofsky's other film, PI; it was good for all the reasons RFAD was bad. PI is subtle, agitated, thoughtful and elegant. RFAD is brash, intentionally unpleasant and, frankly, unrealistic.What is the point of showing the old lady getting electro-shock therapy? This movie IS NOT one flew over the cuckoo's nest. It claims to be about drugs, but in actual fact it is about three deeply selfish people messing up their lives. Who wants to watch this?I thought about it, and realised that there is not a single nice moment in the whole film. Some people will tell you this is the point of it. I can't agree. I think the point of this film is to try and make a film truely unwatchable. It comes very close. I wanted to turn it off several times. I only kept watching to see something good happen (it doesn't) and to listen to the score (which is wonderful).Why did these actors get involved with this project? Ugly, ugly, ugly. I can't remember a film I have enjoyed less.",Null,0,1,22 May 2002
Minority Report," Fascinating, well-constructed moral thriller
","From the advance viewing I saw yesterday, I would say this movie will be the summer blockbuster, not Spider Man. Spielberg's new movie Minority Report delivers the action, suspense and thrills with aplomb. I laughed at the end when the credits rolled, starting with 'Based on a short story by Philip K Dick'. This is not a short movie. At two and a half hours, it is pushing into Private Ryan territory, and while it dips slightly in a few places, these lulls are a needed antidote to the astonishing set-pieces. Short or not, however, the story is terrific. A man heads up a team of hi-tech cops who use three 'pre-cogs' who can determine when a murder will be committed. He pieces together the scraps of information from the brain-scan and works out where the killing will take place. Great! Unfortunately, it backfires. Cruise is fingered for a murder he has yet to commit, against a man he has never met. The next two hours and twenty minutes see him rushing about trying to prove his innocence. The slickness with which Spielberg directs this age-old tale of an innocent man on the run is breathtaking. The details are beautifully realised. The acting is low-key and compelling and the script is intelligent for an action film. Minority Report is an exciting, smart thriller with a hefty double twist at the end. Spend your holiday dollar on this, not Spider Man. You will be rewarded with an intriguing, thought provoking 145 minutes, delivered by the absolute master of adventure movies.",Null,0,0,17 June 2002
The Big Lebowski," Donny, you're out of your element...
","I'm obviously in good company here. If I could choose only one comedy to watch for the rest of my life, this would be it. Put simply, the funniest movie ever written.'The Chinaman is not the issue here!'Glorious.",10,0,0,4 July 2002
Jerry Maguire," Film-making at its very best
","This is a desert island movie: if there was only one piece of cinema I could watch for the rest of my life, Jerry Maguire is it.This is what film-making is all about. A simple, original slant on a classic story. A lively, elegant script. Great combination performances. Wonderful soundtrack. Inspired editing and mellow, warm cinematography.Cameron Crowe is a writer first and foremost, and his script for Jerry Maguire is funny, moving, intelligent and realistic. Chanelled through the capable trio of Zelwegger, Gooding Jr and The Cruiser, he has created perhaps the finest movie of the last 20 years. You will not regret seeing this film, even if you hate the actors. And how many movies can you say THAT about?",10,3,8,6 June 2002
Vanilla Sky," Not as bad as everyone says, but not great either...
","Vanilla Sky will always be a frustrating movie. Not because of any ideas it suggests or observations it makes, but because it could have been a GREAT FILM instead of just an OKAY FILM.For about an hour, this movie is fantastic. Beautifully, inventively shot with a gorgeous New York of classic brownstones and enormous, empty spaces, it is a true visual feast. Contrary to what you may have heard, the Cruiser is very good; whatever anyone says, he is a great actor. Cameron Diaz is good, too, although I've never really liked her that much. Penelope Cruz is her usual sweet self. Jason Lee, however, is magnificent. He really is one of the finest actors in Hollywood, and his attitude towards beards is commendable. His small role in Vanilla Sky is electric, and he is never overshadowed by the Cruiser.
So, for about an hour, this is a superb film. It is creepy, shocking, sexy, funny and utterly compelling. Then Cameron Crowe throws it all down the pan for the sake of a bad twist-in-the-tail. What a shame.Noah Taylor, who is great in Almost Famous, is very annoying. His calm, drab monotone and white suit were so irritating, I wanted to throw my coffee at the screen. Shut up! Plus, the Cruiser decides to forget how to act for the last 20 minutes of the movie, right after he screams 'Tech Support!' in the lobby of L.E. Some of the scriptwriting during the end scene is terrible, too, particularly coming from Kurt Russell. Shame on you Cameron, you can do so much better.Great beginning, terrible ending. A huge disappointment, because it could have been much, much better. The soundtrack, unlike the movie, is uniformly excellent (Beach Boys, Red House Painters, Jeff Buckley).And, if you think about it, the final scene was a bit tasteless; something about a body falling from a tall building in New York...",Null,0,0,7 June 2002
