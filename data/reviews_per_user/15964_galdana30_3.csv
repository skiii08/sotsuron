The Ring," What else can I say?
","I just want to make a short commentary, because everything that can be say about the movie is said. Is the best ghost story I seen in years. Give me the creeps since the beginning. Very slow sometimes but beautifully well done.",9,0,0,12 February 2003
Minority Report," One word: Boring
","I donÂ´t know if I missed something about this movie but I didn't like it. I really want to see it but it was a boring surprise to me. Don'tget me wrong. It has great visuals but the plot was hard to followand a little confused. Sorry Spielberg, I'm a big fan of your work, but this time you didn't convince me. And Tom Cruise, youneed to put more soul in your work.",5,1,2,23 February 2003
Troy," Forget History! That's Entertaiment!
","What an impressive movie. Troy made me remember old classics,sword and sandals style.. It's one of the best movie of his genre. Ithink Eric Bana steal the show as Hector. I expect that he earns anomination next year. I don't care if the script is an adaptation ornot of Homer's poem. I want to make clear one thing: This is a movie, not a history class,so enjoy this product as it deserve: Switch your brain off, eat popcorn, drink a soda and presto!!  Remember... That's onlyentertaiment. If you want to watch things like they happened, the go to the HistoryChannel or National Geographic. Maybe the golden years of Hollywood are back. Who knows?",Null,1,2,20 May 2004
