The Ring," Scary. Picks up momentum nicely, then falls flat at the last second.
","CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! I never saw this movie at the theater because I thought it was going to be another ridiculous teen slasher fest that was tired and dated long before Scream ever graced cinema screens. After renting it and watching it, I was nicely surprised. They took a concept that would be deemed as ridiculously jouvenille, made it into something that actually was pretty scary, executed it quite well, built the pace and even give you a nice false ending where everyone is happy and safe, then all hell breaks loose, or so I thought it was going to. For those who have seen it, you know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't...SPOILER AHEAD...No one should have lived a the end of this movie...it would have only been fair in keeping the pace. The little boy himself says that she never sleeps, and she'll never stop...unless you make a copy of the video tape and make someone else watch it? No thanks. It regressed back to jouvenille silliness with the very last shot of the movie...which was a gigantic dissapointment to such a chilling movie.",Null,0,0,29 April 2003
The Thing," Beautiful filmmaking. What a horror film should be.
","The Thing is a masterpiece of suspense, horror, and gore. No other movie (with the exception of the first three Living Dead movies) has matched The Thing in taking these three elements and blending them into not only a horror film, but a timeless piece of filmaking art. The seclusion, the hopelessness, the creeping terror of not knowing who is who...all of these add up to what modern horror films should take notes from. Carpenter hit his mark and the pinnacle of the art with this movie. It has been compared to Alien several times. But, while Alien is a work of art...its a different kind of style in which the movie was filmed. The Thing begins with a downward spiral into terror and never lets its foot off the gas. The acting is superb, the setting is perfect, the special effects are some that even today cannot be rivaled by CGI, and the tension ever present. If you've never seen it, see it. If you have, see it again.",Null,0,1,9 January 2001
