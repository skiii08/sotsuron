Scarface," Al pacino is Scarface
",This film is a classic al pacino as tony Montana still over 30 years later is one of the most memorable characters in the history of film I honestly believe he was robbed an Oscar for his performance if you want an example the bomb scene in the car his acting in that scene showing tonys inner turmoil is brilliant the music is suspenseful and you know something is going to happen he kills the bomb maker and thats the ultimate irony of the film he did a good deed and got killed for it Imo this is the best remake of all time,10,1,1,29 December 2019
The Incredible Hulk," A decent enough film
",Edward Norton is the best thing about this film apparently he doesn't care for this film which I can see why it could of had a better story its pretty basic not much to it I like the aspects of him learning breathing techniques trying to control his stress levels which was nice I also liked how the origin was told in the opening credits it didnt waste your time and drag like that other film honestly all this needed was a better script and a chance for Norton to really play the tormented banner like in the comics overall its decent film,6,0,0,24 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing- quote by some guy
",This film is dreadful this is the result of one man having complete control over every aspect of his films and surprise it turned out to be crap it opens with a boring political meeting and you people who wanna use the excuses that these films are meant for kids are full of it because I'm sure kids love boring monotone political dialogue it really is like watching cspan the story is poorly written by Lucas in a week Anakin and his mother are slaves but they're living a comfortable life style no chains but the stupid script explains there's bombs in their skulls so if they try to leave it explodes which is baffling stupid here's an idea for this film have Anakin be a 16 year old boy who's family is wiped out by pirates or raiders hes the sole survivor of his colony obi wan discovers him on said planet he survived because he was forced sensitive obi wan trains him all the while he still suffers from ptsd from the attack on his colony there thats how this film should be been we establish Anakins dark side which he represses because of the jedi code,2,1,2,15 December 2019
The Irishman," Just watch once upon a time in america instead
",This film is dull the cgi is soo unconvincing de niros eyes looked soo bright blue he looked like a navi from avatar they spent 200 million dollars on this technology and its laughable the beatdown de niro gives a shop keeper is comedic gold geriatric hitmen the movie is what they should of called this dont waste you're time with this film just watch sergios movie which irionically has a sublot dealing with unions maybe in a way this film was scorceses attempt to outshine Leone but he failed miserably,3,3,7,29 November 2019
The Shining," The creepiest hotel in film history
",I know some critics believe that jacks insanity is the result of cabin fever none of this is really happening its all in his head I never bought into that i disagree 100% the overlook to me is a gateway to hell Jack sells his soul to lyyod for a drink you see his reaction when he drinks the beer he changes he basically lost his soul and is now a demon and the pantry scene grady let him out theres no way he could have gotten out by himself and the fact that Wendy and Danny see all these ghosts I just dont buy into the fact that this is a manifestation of their minds there are clear supernatural things going on in the hotel one of the best scenes is when Jack goes to the cold room and the ghosts are silent until he keeps moving towards them all of a sudden theyre animated with life as he walks by and when he makes his way to the bathroom there's a woman with a bloody handprint on the back of her dress this has gotta be the most extraordinary of hallucinations for Jack to picture all this in his mind and then of course the photo which is the hotel consuming Jack hes apart of it now for all eternity in conclusion this is a unsettling film it's not scary its disturbing which is worse,8,2,4,14 February 2020
Collateral," Okay not spectacular at all
",The story is pretty basic a hitman kidnaps a cabbie and forces him to drive to 5 stops 5 witnesses he has to kill its very convient that the last person Is a woman he just met guess la is a small world the main problem i had with this film is its too long it didnt need to be 2 hours it could have been 1 hour and the music choices are dreadful absolute garbage had to tune my tv down listening to it all together its a pretty forgettable film that i picked up cheap for 5 bucks I would not recommend this film,4,3,7,29 January 2020
American History X," A flawed film
",The alternate ending to this film was derrick shaving his head and reverting back to nazisim which makes sense considering his brother was murdered in cold blood by a black kid for nothing but the film ends saddly with a mixed message which is be nice to black people or you'll get shot none of what derrick went through matterd because his brother was murdered I undertsand the director disowned the film because it wasn't his original vision which I would of been curious to see,6,0,2,15 January 2020
Lawrence of Arabia," A epic masterpiece
",This film is enthralling I was never bored watching it the way its shot the vast landscape the epic score this is a perfect film David lean was a genius to be able to direct this sprawling epic in the 60s with the limited technology I cant imagine how horrible it would have been to film in the desert,10,1,1,9 December 2019
Joker," What do you when cross a mentally ill loner who society has abandoned?
",You get Arthur flick played brilliantly by Phoenix his performance in this film is outstanding much better than any interpretation of this character I honestly cant go back and read any comics or watch any movies because this character is better written than all of them combined this movie doesn't have a supervillian who's going to destroy the city with a bomb none of that crap here we get to see joker the human being a man who has clearly been suffering all his life in the comic they would say it would take one bad day to drive a man insane that's not the case here this man had been suffering for years and finally he cracked one of the best scenes is him watching the tv and he imagines himself at the Murray franklin show he gets single out for his laugh and is accepted and hugged by his idol Murray that was brillant because i don't care who you are we as human beings want to be accepted for who we are and loved unconditionally but that's the problem Arthur never got any of that love he gets treated like sh! by nearly every one in this film the only person who treated him like a human being was the dwarf and Arthur let him live which I thougt was brilliant it added layers of depth to this character the joker in the comics would of killed the dwarf this one didn't which is fascinating to me he only kills people who have directly wronged him like his mother who is a horrible person we find out why Arthur is the way he is because she allowed him to abused and he smother her and says I always thought my life was a tragedy but its a comedy because nothing he does matters his life is a joke by this point in the film hes got nothing to lose when he kills Randall another awful human being who most likely had a hand in getting him fired from his job he embraces his madness and dances down the steps hes liberated finally free to do as he pleases no medication nothing than he goes on the Murray show and I never noticed this detail the 1st time watching it the original joke was knock knock than he proceeded to kill himself live in front of the world to show society this is what you have made me but Murray didnt stfu he kept pushing him the brilliant dialogue and acting in this scene is off the charts quotes like 'if it was me dying on the sidewalk youd walk right by me I pass you every day and you dont notice me' which is true go in any major city see people walk right by homeless on the streets dying nobody cares people are apathetic but then he proceeds to tell Murray youre awful playing my video you just wanted to make fun of me if you look at Arthur in the hospital scene with his mother when Murray played his tape you can see the pain in his face Murray was his idol and he threw him under the bus so he decides to give Murray one last joke what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash I'll tell you what you get you get what you deserve and he blows Murray brains out on live tv and sits there for a moment and laughs because his life is a joke the way the scene played out with the brilliant score you knew it was coming the tension was boiling over and Arthur allows the police to capture him Gotham is full of riots rightfully so the waynes get gunned down as a result of his actions and honestly I don't feel any empathy for the waynes theyre awful people Thomas in particular calling every poor person who has suffered clowns and he says he wants to run for mayor to improve peoples lives yet Arthurs medicial programs are all cut he loses his medicine is forced to go cold turkey if Thomas Wayne actually cared he could of funded a new program but he didnt becuase he didnt care this performance of the Wayne's is the most realistic portrayal of these characters and thr film ends with a what if scenario what really happend was he in the Aslyum all this time it doesn't matter ultimately because the point of the film is society has a role to play in creating these monsters as does the media for publishing their photos and making them stars I hope at least Phoenix gets nominated because if front the Oscars are bs his performance as Arthur fleck had me thinking about this movie for a week it truly is thought provoking and better than any comic book film to come out in 20 years,10,5,9,29 November 2019
The Terminal," An uplifting experience
",Movies like this need to be made more often far too often are there films that are far too bleak but the terminal is not one of them it's soo rare because it's truly uplifting and helps me when I'm going through hard times Tom hanks plays Victor a man stuck at a terminal because of political conflicts and during the span of the film he meets friends and falls for a beautiful stewardess played by catherine zeta Jones and also has an enemy with the head of JFK airport who wants him gone but Victor never lets it get him down he manages to survive thus film has such a optimistic outlook on life that it genuinely makes you feel good watching it so if you're tired of all the dystopian junk give this a try you'll be surprised,8,0,0,13 April 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," A tale of hope
",What can be said that hasn't about this film to me it is the greatest film ever made its inspirational when you think it wouldnt be but each actor in this film delivers a terrific performance it really is about how even in the darkest of places you can find hope I understand sevral people have accredited this film to changing their lives for the better which is rare especially for films to have that impact on someone to give them hope when theyre suffering from depression is a testament to this films greatness and in the end thats what Andy gave red back shawshank took hope away from red but andy gave it back,10,0,0,21 January 2020
