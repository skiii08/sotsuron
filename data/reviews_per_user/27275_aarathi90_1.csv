The New World," Lovely
","This is one of the rare movies that left me breathless... it's beautifully taken and despite criticism from others about the narratives, i found them rather enchanting.... Wow... the relation between Pocahantas and Smith was a wonderful display of emotions... The movie does have it's down sides as the scenes somehow seem to lack a sense of continuity... The movie is a treat to the eyes and it's hard to tear ones eyes off the scene, at times... However at other times it is hard to not wish that the scene would move faster... To show reality the movie has become rather slow paced... All in all this movie is for those who are able to appreciate what is not spoken but is felt...",8,4,9,18 April 2006
