The Blair Witch Project," Scary, not quite, but disturbing and unnerving? Oh yeh, big time.
","You'll laugh. Now that's what surprised me the most, there are some bits where you really will laugh - I wonder if audiences did when they thought the whole thing was real? We even found ourselves laughing at the end, but that was totally different, a nervous uneasy laugh. The kind of laugh that hides the fact that you're scared to go home after the cinema and walk in the house on your own without any lights.Go see this film, okay there's far too much hype, and there's far too many people rubbishing it for no real reason, but you have to see it. If you're a fan of psychological horror then this is for you, actually I don't think you can really use the word horror, psychological terror would be better.The real disturbing thing was the way the 'fright' sections were underplayed, add to that the strange feeling you got from eavesdropping on three people as their relationships falls apart and you've got a film that really messes with your head.Try to forget all you've heard about it, sit down, and watch, and please, don't have nightmares!",7,0,1,3 November 1999
Scarface," Hard and violent film with stunning performances
","An astounding film. Brian DePalma does his usual magic and produces a slick and gritty portrayal of a lowlife hitting the streets of America and rising up through the ranks to the top of the Gangster ladder and, ultimately, his fall back down.Michelle Pfieffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Steve Bauer are very good, and Al Pacino is just stunning, this is an ideal role for him, and perhaps the start of his, in my opinion, career typecasting.The story is hard-hitting and violent, and although it can look dated in parts, it still shines through as a top class film.",9,0,0,28 October 2001
Walk the Line," Wonderful performances, writing and stylish filming make an excellent movie.
","Going into Walk the Line it's fair to say I knew nothing about Johnny Cash other than the Ring of Fire song and one of my more eccentric school friends who was into his music while most other kids were reading Smash Hits and watching Top of the Pops! So I wasn't sure what to expect and how the movie would affect me, and like most of the prospective audience I was attracted by awards hype, reviews and the always strong Joaquin Phoenix.I was also lucky enough to see the screening in the Gold Class of the cinema when no other Press has turned up until fifteen minutes into the movie. So the extended introduction of Walk the Line reverberating through the underseat base and the wonderfully filmed opening sequence projected onto the huge screen really hit me with force. The opening is both visually and audibly superb. Building tension, setting the tone perfectly for the movie, and defining the circular nature of the storyline.That's one of the excellent things about this movie, the story. It's superbly written and brought to the screen. A cliffhanging moment of tension created from the outset using visuals of Fulsom Prison, the Walk the Line introduction and no real words. I have to say this is one of the best movie opening sequences I've seen in a long time. Powerful and attention grabbing from the first second.The entire movie is beautifully filmed and visualised, recreating the era with ease and taking you to those moments even if you haven't lived through them or were even born. It's full of well framed shots often with a slow moving tracking move, giving it a very natural and authentic feel. None of the filming or set-ups are anything more than is required and never pulls you out of the movie.Then there's the music, music I was just not aware of, which makes its affect on me even more astounding. I'm now singing Cash songs in my head, the day after the movie and I'm awaiting arrival of some of his records. I now may well be a Cash fan, and that's through both the music of Cash and the performance and singing of Pheonix.It's something that should never be a great consideration for acting talent though. If he or Reese Witherspoon had mimed their way through this movie would their acting performances be any less? I doubt so. However they do sing all the songs and authentic or not they are excellent and convincing performances. Hence the soundtrack release with their own recordings.Singing aside their performances as actors are amazing and the chemistry between them is as real as anything I've seen or experienced.Pheonix gives a stunning performance of intensity and burning passion. He's a totally tormented character and to be quite frank, thoroughly unlikable in the movie, yet you are drawn to his performance and find a connection through his suffering, redemption and through the relationship with June Carter played by Witherspoon.She also gives an emotionally charged performance, one which is worthy of her accolades and awards. Yet I can't understand why Pheonix has not been as recognised. In my eyes his performance is the winner in this film, but she successfully casts off any of her previous light roles and proves she is a real actress of weight and stature.Robert Patrick is also well cast and gives a powerful performance as the father of Cash. He starts as a drunk but then gives through to a hard and unyielding man. It's a similar performance to his Terminator role, although much more human! Seriously though, he does pull off the role well and set against Pheonix you feel the tension hurtling off screen.There are some very notable scenes between the three of them. When Pheonix as Cash discusses his dead brother with Carter it's a strong and emotionally poignant moment. A scene in direct contrast to this is the Thanksgiving stand off against his Father which explains so much about the character of Cash and indeed of his abuse of himself. In fact this movie does help to show you how someone can come to abuse themselves through such things as drugs and alcohol. His journey through this common and often misunderstood path is clearly shown and explained through clever and intelligent writing, direction and performances.Overall it's a strong and emotional movie filled with excellent characterisations and performances. The story is very well written and transferred of screen. However it's not entirely without issue.The sequences of touring felt slightly longer than necessary and although the on stage performances were great with some excellent songs, I did feel that similar ground was being covered in the later stages.Still, through these scenes the relationship between him, his family, wife and Witherspoon continue to be built upon and it does leave with a good understanding of them all.The ending does seem to fill you with some level of twee-ness but there is absolutely no arguing with it - it's factually based and I've heard that this couples love for each other was that strong a bond.Without a doubt I'd recommend this movie even if you aren't a Cash fan or have no idea what his music is like. For the first time in a long time I actually want to go and see a movie a second time. Well worth watching.",10,0,2,31 January 2006
Antz," Superb film, far better than Bugs Life.
","I had already seen Bugs Life before watching this, and I really thought that it couldn't be better, boy was I wrong. There are tons of famous actors, and the voices seem to have been matched to the characters perfectly. Gene Hackman is an inspired choice, and, although I personally hate the voice and style of Woody Allen, this part was ideal for him. Oh, and superb voicing by Stallone too, what a dude! Oh, and there's Christopher Walken, and...stop it.The story is excellent, and keeps you entertained all the way through, I was so engrossed in the events of this little colony. Both the story and the animation seemed more authentic and grown up than that of Bugs Life, and I think I would be more inclined to watch this film a number of times. Watch it.",9,0,0,11 September 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Overly stylised, but a much cleaner second half with a harrowing ending.
","For the most part this movie ambles along, caught up in a few stylistic touches that it doesn't quite manage to deliver. The repeating mundane and reinforcing dialogue and visuals just go to remind you of events and circumstance that you already know.However, it is in the second half of the film where it really gets its message forward. It shows how four peoples lives career out of control when drugs begin to take over their lives, and not all from the illegal point of view.From the second half it's a very interesting and compelling film, dropping to total despair by the last twenty minutes. The final sequence is one of the most harrowing to endure in the movies I've seen in the last few years, and tackles the issues head on without flinching.Overly stylised it certainly is, but if you can endure those moments and progress onto the latter part of the movie you will have a head on crash with the ending. Harrowing is hardly the word.I have to say, stunning performance from Jennifer Connelly, and an equally amazing and surprising show from Marlon Wayans. Dump that Wayans trade mark movie and get into the real thing.",6,1,2,12 November 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting
","I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time.",10,164,225,24 December 2004
Minority Report," A very good sci-fi film, nowhere near the awful example of AI.
","You might go to the cinema thinking, `Oh noAI'. As you watch the opening sequences, you might think `Oh noloads of new sci-fi toys'. Then that's all behind you as you're taken into a very good story, where you don't really see the end. There are a few guessable points along the way, but for that there are also a few surprises to make you jump, and make you think. Since it's Dreamworks you can expect, and get, an intelligent story and some amazing effects. As always, the effects do not take over the story, and it's still very human and issue driven. Tom Cruise is not overly distracting, as I tend to find him, and he puts in a solid performance. A very good film, even if you notice the glaring continuity error and manage to put up with more product placements than.wellthan a Bond film!",7,0,1,16 October 2002
Training Day," Excellent performances with a good, fast paced script.
","Excellent performance from Denzel Washington and an equally believable one by Ethan Hawke. The well written and thought out plot keeps this high paced thriller moving along nicely. It keeps you unsure of what either of the main characters' motives are, or even if they have any at all. Initially the Washington character can seem quite grating, showing the well written part, and soon your sympathies are lying with whom they should be. Although the ending is quite weak, and can leave you feeling short changed, it still makes a good, well written film.",7,0,11,10 February 2003
Fight Club," Fantastic fantasy with real messages for real people
","I don't think this film will work on DVD, that media is only dual layered, this film is multi layered! How I didn't get lost during this I don't know, but I was shot along with the storyline, not only understanding it, but also identifying with it. It's brilliant.I found the first half of the film almost meandered along, stretching things out to meet the latter half where the story spins around and doubles up on the speed. The ending is superb and very bizarre, in fact the whole second half is bizarre, and yet believeable.That's something that amazed me, how we were shown to understand and identify with these characters, even though they are leading and participating in some of the strangest acts. Very often we watch characters who we don't, and can't, believe in. It doesn't ruin the film, but it can't drag it down as we loose storyline and interest. That never happens here.The acting is superb, Norton and Carter steal the entire film with a surprise performance from Meat Loaf. Brad Pitt is there, and he was good, but powerfully overshadowed by Norton. The film was visually stunning and in no way was the fighting glamourised or made to look appealing, in fact those scenes were sometimes quite disturbing, the way violence really is.I've seen reviews and heard people say that it looses itself in the second half, I'd say it doesn't find itself until the second half. I think that's when we find ourselves too. You can identify, understand and sympathise with almost all that's going on, and these are keys that all film makers try and get hold of. Fincher does, and he puts them in the right lock, turns it, and opens a door that leads onto some very horrible thoughts and ideas.See this film. Now.",9,0,1,24 November 1999
As Good as It Gets," Superb acting with witty, sharp dialog.
","A story of messed up real life people trying to find a happy hollywood ending, almost real life for a change.Nicholson is fantastic getting all the quick witted replies and comments that he deserves, and Hunt provides a fantastic lead opposite him and the pair blend beautifully together in their scenes.Gooding and Kinnear provide strong support, but it's Kinnear who outshines Gooding, why haven't we seen him in more prominent roles before?The film can get a bit sappy in places, but it always brings it back to reality with a bang.Definately a go see, for all those Victor Meldrew types.",8,2,3,12 January 2000
The Fan," Slick, and good looking, but lacking in substance
","From the outset this film is well shot, it looks slick and you can tell who was at the helm. Unfortunately the story is quite weak, you feel no empathy for any of the characters, and the acting seems to be just enough to get the job done. I must say that Wesley Snipes acted better than he has ever done before, no action for him to fall back on this time. (I have to admit though, I am a Snipes fan!). Miss it.",4,2,8,25 June 2001
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," An excellent adaptation with superb effects. Very entertaining.
","When going to see this movie there were two things that were with me as baggage walking through that darkened doorway, thankfully I managed to leave both right there allowing me to enjoy the movie. One was the animated film I saw when I was a child, and the other was the hype and associated comparisons to Lord of the Rings both by Author association and Hollywoods new found love of the trilogy.Neither affected the viewing of the movie and I was drawn into the film from the opening scenes. I can quite honestly say that even if I had been affected by those pieces of baggage, or indeed carried some of the religious argument into the cinema, I would still have been pulled into the movie just the same.The story grabs you from the opening scenes of the Blitz and the performances of the children pull you right in. Immediately you understand the group dynamics and personalities of the children. That's one of the amazing strengths of this movie that carries from beginning to end, the storytelling.Despite the huge effects and locations the real power is the story itself, pulling the classic book down into a manageable movie and yet keeping the moralistic tale filled with believable and identifiable characters. The movie does this amazingly well.The acting is superb too, which helps the audience succumb to the tale. In particular the children are the shining stars of the film, with Georgie Henley as Lucy shining the brightest. There's a fine line between a young child star overacting and pulling off a strong performance of a childs' naivety, and she walks that fine line perfectly.Skandar Keynes as Edmund is another character who is very ably acted, he portrays the petulant child well. Through this performance you can actually understand how he comes to his betrayal and you empathise with the range of emotions as he realises what he has done and how his young family have been affected.Liam Neeson as Aslan was an interesting choice. Originally I had heard that this was to be voiced by Brian Blessed and that due to, allegedly, changes in his voice from dieting he was swapped for Neesom. Now this choice seemed poor for me, the voice of Blessed is strong and commanding and I didn't feel that Neesom carried the gravitas that could carry the role. How wrong I was. Neesoms voice was perfect for the part of Aslan, projecting warmth and strength wonderfully well.The acting across the board is really good with Tilda Swinton proving to be a very strong and foreboding White Witch. Other roles, such as James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus and voices like that of Ray Winstone as Mr Beaver, are very well acted and totally immersive.The effects are stunning in this movie, although there are a few moments where the green screen effect is apparent. What makes the larger creature effects so good is that they are combining CGI with costume and make up, combining reality with make believe. The only slight stumbling block of these effects is during the full scale battle scenes when CGI takes over totally and some of the more natural textures and movements are lost. However its not a huge setback and your eye is only distracted by it if you are watching very carefully, while you're absorbed by the movie you're likely not to notice.The battle scenes are choreographed very well be they live action or CGI. Flowing and fantastically detailed, the larger battle scenes do not end up as a mess of creatures and body parts. I was reminded of the battle scenes from The Last Samurai which were almost graceful in the way they played out.There are obvious comparisons with Lord of the Rings during the battle scenes, the sheer scale and epic feel of them as well as the multitude of mythical creatures, but that's where it ends. Sure there are many connections and similarities, but these are two altogether different tales and hugely different movies.Something else I noticed on this movie - and usually when this aspect of a film is so noticeable it's a bad thing - was the music. Music should compliment the story, said the composer of The Crimson Rivers soundtrack, it should not try to overtake and retell the story. Likewise it should not disappear into the audio track and not have some form of impact.The music for this movie hits these statements firmly on the head. It matches the movie perfectly and every scene it touches, it helps to build emotions and heighten tension, and bring the audience back down when the pace slows.I have to say I was surprised at the ending. The temptation to create it in an overly romanticised manner or dwell upon the successions to the throne is avoided and instead we are treated as adults and the conclusion moves on more to setup the second movie. Oh, and a spot of advice, stay to watch the credits.This movie belongs alongside The Lord of the Rings and holds great hope for the remainder of the trilogy.",9,1,3,29 January 2006
Oldboy," An amazing story, wonderfully visualised, directed and acted. A must see.
","Oldboy begins with a typical Hitchcock style story. A man is imprisoned for 15 years with no understanding of why or, during his incarceration, any idea of how long. Then suddenly he is free and his journey begins.The style in this film just pours out of the screen. Yet they don't overpower and dominate the movie as they would in Hollywood, they look as integral to the story as do the actors and the dialogue. They aren't treated as a big moment but viewed as a whole with the rest of the film. There are some really nice touches throughout the movie, in particular the movement between scenes, the corridor fight or the beautifully shot snow scene all really stand out for me.That brings me nicely onto the action topic. Asian film, 'must be lots of martial arts' I hear some of you non-converts shout. Not at all. The action and fighting is some of the most realistic I've seen in a movie. People go down when they are hit, and when hit hard they stay down. That is except Oldboy himself, fuelled by fifteen years of revenge and hatred, he is allowed a but more leeway. Yet that doesn't stop the action being beautifully choreographed and put together.In particular the fight scene in the corridor shows the beauty and care placed into the fight scene. It takes place in a long corridor with the camera panning back and forth following the action as Oldboy, successfully and realistically, fights approximately fifteen men. The action frequently slows and stops, and with no real moments where you are pulled back out of the movie thinking you are watching the impossible.Some of the scenes are tough to watch, not because they are all gruesome, but because Asian filmmakers have the balls to push the audience and make them feel something more than the average cinema experience. To feel something, much like the main character. So scenes are uncomfortable or uneasy because you're feeling the same as the characters.The live sushi moment is stunning to watch, and conjured up some strange emotions in me, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. The torture scenes are arduous but so real and fear inducing. Perhaps the most shocking and emotionally strong moments are saved for the latter half of the film. Don't be concerned though, these aren't vile in any way, they just make you feel incredibly uncomfortable and very uneasy.To me, that is what cinema is all about, even all art. It's about making you feel something, not sitting in a darkened room letting images and story wash over you then disappearing for your dinner and a chat about the weather. You want, and need, to be pulled into the movie, to feel and empathise with the characters, forget about the world around you and all the other people and their lives, and finally come away with the haunting of those feelings. The movie should continue on in your mind and pop up in conversations, provoking thoughts and discussion, otherwise you've wasted your time and money. Oldboy satisfies that to perfection.Unfortunately I can't really go into the story, not that I do much in reviews anyway, but in the case of Oldboy it really does give far too much away even touching on it. Check out the IMDb listing if you really want, however just trust me, it's a superb story and you don't want to know anything more about it beforehand. For the last twenty minutes or so you will be astounded and the twists and turns keep coming right up to the very end.It's also quite a moving story and takes on what exactly makes a person and defines who they are and the labels they carry through their lives. Most of all though it's about revenge and how unfulfilling, all consuming and empty it can make you feel.The actors are really good across the whole movie, but it is the leads that really excel. Min-sik Choi is utterly believable and gives such a powerful performance. His acting coupled with the visual style will have you holding your breath at times. The female lead Hye-jeong Kang and the protagonist Ji-tae Yu also offer excellent performances. The range of emotion that the character Woo-jin Lee has to go through is enormous, and Yu performs them brilliantly, while Kang plays a restrained, controlled and tortured mind to perfection. There is a real depth to these characters, and they are brought to life by these three wonderful actors.This movie is an excellent example of what cinema can be, and once again the lesson comes from outwith Hollywood, I just wish they would sit up and listen in class. The movie is not any single scene, but the sum of it's wonderful set pieces, beautiful style, imaginative camera work, truly wonderful performances from all the leads, and a stunning story. You have to see this movie.",10,18,97,30 August 2005
Chicken Run," Laugh, laugh, oh, and laugh some more!
","Funny, innovitave escape comedy created with the same passion & ideals that wallace & grommit were, no hollywood sellout here. There's some excellent film jokes here, and some slightly more older ones too. This is a film for, and I hate to say such a cliche, kids of all ages. With some inspirational choices in characters and voices, you'll be whipped along for a laughing, entertaining ride. It's hard to believe that these little chickens aren't real, and behind that fast moving camera there really isn't a crew, even if they are plasticene too! Fantastic stuff.",8,0,0,18 November 2000
Insomnia," Misses the mark somewhat, but a not bad film with Robin Williams shining.
","Well, I was unsure about this when I went to see it. When Robin Williams is billed next to Al Pacino, it's very difficult to decide if it's going to work out. However, the concept had me intrigued. The film starts off well, and the tension that Pacino creates with his partner is very tangible, this part of the film is where he really gets something to act with. However, I couldn't help but feel, as the film progressed, it was relying on his weary features to produce the look of an insomniac, rather than his true acting abilities. A few brief moments with the rookie Alaskan cop shows there's still something there, but I think it was the story that confined his acting rather than his acting confining the story.Robin Williams, however, puts in a wonderful performance. I couldn't see him in this role and I was convinced I'd be thinking about his comic runs. Not once, well maybe not true, but I only thought of them in retrospect. I was totally absorbed by his performance, and you almost are in a dilemma over his situation. He should get more serious roles out of this.The rest of the cast acts well, but I'm afraid that this may be another case of a Hollywood film ruining a good foreign film, although I have yet to see the original. The suspense is dampened throughout the second half, and I can't quite put my finger on why. Perhaps we are told too much and shown too much in the first half, and you know everything that is going on and why at every turn. Although it is billed that you will be torn as to what is wrong and right, this lasted for a mere instant, as the rights are so obviously more right than the wrongs. I think this is mainly due to the fact that the wrongs are all you are shown and what is played on, and too much of the character in the right is explained from a sympathetic point from the beginning.Right, enough of this essay. It's a pretty good film, and I know people who really enjoyed it, but unfortunately I feel it failed to project that blurring of wrong and right, and the suspense you would have expected.",5,0,1,16 October 2002
Match Point," Almost all great natural performances, wonderfully written and unnoticeably directed.
","I liked it from the opening moment, I really liked the titles before the movie, it was sort of a sign that this is different from the other movies you're watching, this harks back. The short introduction after this starts off the film nicely, and ties in much later on. It gives a little overview of what the film is about and how luck plays through our lives more than anything. Simply filmed and simply written, and yet it has a great impact both then, and retrospectively.That was it, I started to like the movie already, and then Rhys-Meyers (Wilton) began talking and I felt my face screw up involuntarily. His acting voice was stilted and seemed very nervous, it just didn't sit right at all and gave quite an unnatural performance through the first half of the movie where emotions are checked and played low. It had more effect than just an annoyance though and for much of that first half I was continually pulled out of the movie because of the performance, yet there were performances that grabbed me by the throat and pulled me right in.Johansson (Rice) doesn't start off that strong, she gives a plain but good performance, it's really in the latter half of the film that her character turns around and becomes impassioned, giving some depth to her performance. She is undoubtedly a great actress.Mortimer, Goode, Cox and Wilton provide the entire Hewett family which Wilton slowly becomes a part of, and they all provide such real and utterly believable performances.Something I noticed about the entire cast, apart from Rhys-Meyers, is their natural performance and well delivered lines. For these performances just seemed so realistic that you are drawn into them and into the heart of this family without any difficulty. It's even in subtle lines and gestures made throughout the movie as the family members and friends interact with each other, the dialogue is natural and flowing with characters often talking over each other as in real life. Throughout the movie there's perhaps only one line and one scene where the feeling was dropped for me, other than Rhys-Meyers first half performance of course.Yet when the movie progresses and the mood changes, Rhys-Meyers starts to come to life and the stilted and awkward delivery fades in favour of a confused, bored and childish man. A man filled with more emotion and passion than previously seen, and it's here where we really begin to see the driving force of the movie and where I felt myself becoming more and more impatient and anxious as to how events would turn. In fact I wouldn't be stretching to say that I felt a growing dread, particularly when the family were together.Wilton happens into the Hewett family and becomes a part of it, entering into a rich life in all aspects of the word. He is very privileged and becomes very accustomed to it. However something is either missing from his relationship with his wife, or he's merely wanting what he doesn't have, whichever is the real reason he becomes a passionate affair which spirals out of control.It's during this affair where I felt the writing, direction and the performances pull together superbly and gave me these particular feelings. If I was to be in an affair I can imagine that it would be exactly like this (to a point in the story obviously) and you can imagine the conversations, phonecalls, confrontations, lies and hard choices being almost exactly as they are on screen. I totally believed in what I was watching at this point. When the family met together with Winton carrying on the deceit, often swapping the role of husband with lover and moving directly to a scene of a clandestine meeting, those feelings of impatience, anxiousness and dread built within me.Somehow I engaged with his character, despite the earlier negative feelings to the performance, and felt as trapped and panicked as he did. Then when the family were together I realised I had fallen into the bond of the family, and with the fantastic performance of Mortimer as his wife, making me feel nervous and concerned about what would happen to them and how they could be hurt if the affair was made public.There are some other very good smaller roles here from British actors that you wouldn't have expected either. Some of these were surprising to see, and all gave very good performances, albeit briefly.The ending is very interesting, and takes a very strange turn. Luckily there's not much notice of this and gives you a nice surprise, at which point the movie does take a different turn. It's through this ending that the opening introduction returns bringing back the notion of luck and how it might, or might not, turn against you.A couple of scenes here nudged my belief in the character of Wilton slightly through Rhys-Meyers performance and lines, however it wasn't enough to damage the end of the movie which is decidedly different and quite bold in it's final moments.Throughout the movie, at key points, Allen utilises arias as score and also scene transitions, and in the second half these moments really come into their own when you do start to feel you are watching an operatic tragedy. It's here where I do feel that this style came through more as a storytelling device than a background score.Overall I would recommend this movie, despite a feeling of the first half being too long and of the negative aspects Rhys-Meyers performance, it's an engrossing and interesting movie, one which does manage to engage and affect you right till the closing scene. Performances in the film are very strong, and had me dragged right into the movie into the minds of the characters, all except Rhys-Meyers who I found struggled with his performance.",8,6,11,4 January 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Unfunny gothic Frank Drebin alights on Sleepy Hollow.
","I found this very disappointing, and I like Tim Burton. The whole film seemed like 'Naked Gun 4:Ye Olde Days' starring Johnny Depp as an incredibly unfunny Frank Drebin, and I honestly couldn't stop thinking this whenever I saw him on screen. Christina Ricci's character seems so false and irritating I kept wishing she would loose her head in her opening scene! Saying this, the story is very good and Christopher Walken plays the most amazing character, although he is seen all too briefly for my liking - not much work for a lot of money no doubt. Miranda Richardson is by far the best talent in the film, unless Walken had more screen time. The story runs well but it seems to have missed what it was aiming for and doesn't know if it's trying to be a comedy or a gothic horror, and in this case the two just don't seem to mix.",4,1,2,7 February 2000
We Were Soldiers," A harrowing, realistic war movie with intelligence, but peppered with bad edits
","Much was talked about this movie when it first came out, with the obvious comparisons made to Mel Gibson's other historical epic Braveheart, and those made me steer clear of the movie for a good while, although now I find myself wondering why after seeing it this weekend.It rivals Saving Private Ryan for the realism and gore factor, bringing the devastation and personal pain involved in war right at you without flinching.Gibson is strong in this role, but plays it at quite a lower key than he did in Braveheart, and it works really well. He really is a great actor, sure you can question some of his decisions and roles, but he can really pull off an emotional scene at both ends of the spectrum, and he has to show them all.The film certainly shows how harrowing the first assault of the Vietnam war really was, and how utterly pointless it was. It was amazing to see the courage and strength of the young men involved, and then being shown the flip side with the cowardice and idiocy of the suits in charge and their disregard for the lives of the soldiers.Although the movie concentrates on the US Soldiers it does turn to the Vietnamese Commander and show the similarities between them and their belief and love for their soldiers.Something that strikes me about many of the US historical movies is their blatant disregard for history, and their total belief in the American way above all else. The US won World War II by themselves, they managed to break the hold of the German Submarines by finding and cracking their code machine and they leapt into action and poured destruction on the Japanese after Pearl Harbour.None of this is seen in this movie, yes there is a strong American belief, but in this movie it's much more real. The belief is there, but it's from the soldiers who really believe in their Country and what they are fighting for, a feeling that was present in the real world before this war, and has struggled through since.It is a great war movie, it's also a very moving and harrowing one, showing what the Soldiers went through for their country and how their officials, and indeed their people, failed them.However it's not all good. The movie seems to have many swift cuts which are suited to the battle scenes, but not in transitions, and it begins to have the feel that there are portions of the movie edited out. This is certainly backed in the continuity of the story and how some crucial background and key scenes just seem to be raced through giving you the barest of information before heading off to another battle.That really harms the movie for me, and it's a shame because there is so much of this movie which is really, really good.",7,2,3,20 March 2005
Crash," Well written and some truly great performances. Hard and uncompromising, real life indeed.
","Mixed reviews on the Internet, big cast, multi-angled story, to me it sounded like a few other movies that have treaded the same ground but still very interesting. The talents of Paul Haggis and the exciting casting of Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, et al, attracted me to this movie and I am thankful that I ignored what the critics have said.The movie is a group of stories of different people that all connect through each other and all relate in some way. It's a strong story, and quite a controversial one. Large in both it's concept and it's cast. I can guess some of their negative reaction has been due to the uncomfortable feeling the movie has throughout and the very strong nature of its content. It's a difficult journey, but well worth going to see.From the opening scene you're pretty much guaranteed to be shocked and uncomfortable, I know we were and we weren't expecting the tirade of abuse, one of the more uncomfortable aspects of this scene is that it's from a white man to a Persian, whom he thinks is actually an Iraqi. A very disturbing scene, and something that the movie is all about. The abuse doesn't just stop at the white American on Persian, it moves to Latino against Chinese, Chinese against black, black against black, black against white, white against Chinese, and so on.It covers how hard it is for people in L.A. (and indeed any city) to actually get close to someone else and understand them. It seems to be much easier to blame problems on others than to actually face up to them, and if this movie is anything to go by, racism is a very common aspect of this culture.The movie is telling us that if we take some time to get to know the people around us, perhaps make conversation and don't stereotype them, we may just get along a little better. Lives might even be saved. Don't make the mistake that it's all happy though, it isn't. Even those who think they have made the connections already, haven't done so on anything more than a superficial level.Couple these aspects together and you have one serious movie. Although it is hard to watch and it does make you feel very uncomfortable, it makes you feel something, and that is what cinema is about for me. I left in debate about the movie, both of us, and that's a great thing.Acting wise I was very surprised. Both Bullock and Brendan Fraser play characters well out of their normal sphere of acting, specifically Bullock and she absolutely excels as the D.A.'s wife who is very much on her own. If you ever thought she was a light actress you should see her performance here, strong with a well written and performed fear and growing racist anger, I can't be vocal about her performance enough. The only sad thing is that it is all too short.Fraser also acts out of normal character, he plays the D.A. and there's not a hint of comedy in the script, unfortunately there is in his face and actions to camera.Thandie Newton actually provides a good performance, although yet again she plays a woman with a chip on her shoulder and huge attitude, just like many of her previous characters. Yet she has more range here I felt, and she shows it well. Her frustration, anger and almost all consuming fear is so obvious on screen, and she really does give the performance a great deal.For me Newton and Dillon gave two great performances, and the interaction between them on the two different scenes give a very powerful message. Not only about the Police force, but also about race relations in general, and shows a common understanding between both characters. This is one of the most powerful relationships in the movie.However, the strongest pairing and the best acting in this movie for me goes to two non-lead actors. Michael Pena and Bahar Soomekh as the Hispanic locksmith and the Persian local store owner respectively, give the most heartfelt and strong performances in this movie. They, without a doubt, steal the show from the big names and quite rightly so.There are some poorer aspects to the movie though, I felt a couple of the scenes were presented in quite a contrived manner, and instead of events leading to them being quite explainable or understandable, they felt strained and stretched. A perfect example of how this could be avoided was with the second Newton-Dillon scene, no explanation, no lead up, the event had just happened and the important thing was the story that unfolded before you and the aftermath. That's real life, often things happen and there's not a need to overly explain the lead up.The ending, although not all good by a long way, reminded me a lot of Magnolia. Not because of anything more than a moment of plot device, but coupled with the same style of storytelling it was enough to knock me out of the movie and make the connection.Overall the messages are strong, uncompromising and often quite bleak. Do not make a mistake, this is real life and not a nice fluffy bunny tale. Despite some moments that are a little contrived, there are a surprising amount of exceptional performances to be seen and the story gives you a real kick in the head about how we really should be as people. Thoroughly recommended.",9,2,8,7 September 2005
Snatch," An impressive second film, although very similar to Lock Stock, it's somewhat better.
","This was an impressive second film from Guy Ritchie, although it's extremely similar to Lock Stock and two smoking barrels, even down to the different storylines inadvertantly affecting each other for the conclusions.Some of the acting was weak, yet some of the casting choices were inspired, Mike Reid (Doug the head) and Alan Ford (Brick Top) were outstanding, and as for Boris the Blade, what an awesome character. The funniest storyline has to be the bungled attempt to rob the bookies, the three characters are just so funny. Unfortunately Vinnie Jones (Bullet Tooth) didn't seem to have a character as good as in Lock Stock, this guy seemed to flawed for his persona, and I found nothing likeable in the character of Turkish (Jason Statham), this would have had to have been the poorest performance.Apart from that, it's a fantastic film, the script has been extremely well thought out and provided interesting twists that weren't expected. Better than Lock Stock, go see it.",8,0,1,11 September 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," A clever, witty script. Generally a well observed comedy.
","I was very dubious about watching this movie, being a man, however within the first five minutes I was laughing heartily and knew, without a doubt, that this movie was going to be a good one. I wasn't wrong. Even for the men, this movie contains much to identify with, even with the Bridget Jones character. The whole cast is fantastic, with Hugh Grant showing that he can actually pull off a really good role. Renee Zellweger is superb in the lead, and you just can't help liking her and her embarrassing habit of putting her foot in it. There are some clever and witty one-liners and some wonderfully put together scenes, with some well-observed comedy. I whole-heartedly recommend this film, despite the over sentimental ending, it does the job and gives you that nice warm feeling at the end of it.",8,0,0,22 January 2003
Predator," Arnie's best film, and a fantastic action adventure treat.
","`If it bleeds we can kill it'. Oh, Arnie just rocks in this movie. I have to admit I am a huge Arnie fan. He may not be the worlds best actor, but he can entertain better than anyone, and especially in an action film of this calibre. It's a simple story, and hugely effective, pitting Arnie against a huge, human hunting, alien. No, now, he might not winah, who cares, that's not the point. It's the journey, and the loss of men, one by one. The atmosphere is great, the choice of actors wonderful, and the one-liners fly about with reckless abandonand you end up loving every one. OkayI have memorised most of them, but only through repeated watching. It's so worth it. Watch it!",9,0,0,16 October 2002
Notting Hill," Just a bad remake of Four weddings and a funeral, with worse acting.
","It could have been a nice film, if not for the following faults. The cheesy, laboured dialogue of the Hugh Grant character, where he says the stupidest things possible, and acts in the most inane way that leads to loosing the girl on multiple occasions. I mean, at times it's so out of character, and so idiotic, that you are almost grimacing and shouting at the screen! Also, something I couldn't understand, is if the housemate had behaved as badly as he had throughout the film, through his entire stay there, Grants' character would have kicked him out long ago. Julia Roberts is great in this film, and looks the best she ever has, and I'm not that much of a fan, but she looks gorgeous here. However, that does not make it worth going to see, or even hiring out to watch. Miss it, and loose nothing. It is, after all, a bad remake of Four Weddings. Just slight circumstance changes.",4,2,6,16 October 2002
The Italian Job," Not a patch on the original, but not bad entertainment
","I was biased to this movie from the announcement of production. I mean a film that is touted not as a remake, but as being influenced by the original and truly wonderful Italian Job, immediately struck me as another idiotic Hollywood idea. My feelings were twisted even more when I heard that the heist in the new movie was happening in LA, so what was with the title? You've pretty much guessed that at this point I thought very little of the movie, had I known Donald Sutherland was in it then some of my respect may have been won back, but I didn't.In the interests of my movie reviews, I was determined to see it, after all even if it was awful it needed to be seen. So I rented the DVD and began to watch. I was surprised. To be fair Sutherland carries all of the movie he's in, and Mark Wahlberg struggles to get anything near acting while he's on screen with him, his mumbling monotone voice fumbling embarrassingly through their scenes. It's only until Sutherland is off screen that Wahlberg begins to gather some acting talent back.However most of the cast still seem like they're walking through it. Even Edward Norton seems to tackle this with a half hearted gesture. To be honest there are two people who really stand out in this movie, and that's Jason Statham and, believe it or not, Seth Green. They're both lively and watchable characters. The others appear flat and emotionless.That's not to say it's an enjoyable movie, in the entertainment sense it's quite fun. Some of the heist moves are set up well, and the stunts are particularly good, mainly because of the effort put in by the behind the scenes team to make them all as real as possible and try to avoid any special effects.",6,0,1,15 April 2005
Pitch Black," Edge of your seat suspense, and nothing like Alien!
","I must say, when I first saw this arrive I was sceptical. A cast, mostly unknown, an interesting idea and a trailer full of wonderful scenes, which I thought might be the movie there and then, with creatures that reminded me of Alien. Another shoddy collection of other films into a new sci-fi I thought. Wrong.This story doesn't have a hero, it has many flawed characters, all of whom behave unexpectedly and change before you as the story unfolds. The suspense of the story is pulled from the lack of trust between these characters and the whole premise of complete darkness throughout. The idea of having the one person who could save everyone as being the one person there's no way on any planet you could trust, is ideal. It also brings forth the idea that you're behind the bad guy all the way, just like the Terminator.My surprise at the effects, the acting, the standard of filming and storyline was high. I expected a bit of a turkey, instead this film scares you as well as Alien did, and even comes out with surprises right to the very end.Excellent film.",8,0,0,26 October 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A poor sequel to a wonderful series, a joke of a Terminator movie.
","It's a shame, this movie started off so well, and with so much promise, despite the concern as to the absence of James Cameron, I thought the plot looked good and Arnie was back.However, it really quickly turned into a joke of a Terminator movie. Not much brooding terror as the Terminator entered the present day again; comic laughs were played for from the outset. Surely Leslie Nielson was due in at any second?Saying that, there were some of the original elements still there, the darkness; the downside to the story; the future twist that was yet to happen and you'd probably never see, and the human moments while the excitement was still thick in the air. Unfortunately, many of these were just swept over quickly in short bursts of dialogue to make way for another huge set piece.Not that the set pieces weren't amazing, it's just that by the end of the film, you feel that it was almost all a collection of set pieces. The audience was hardly given time to digest the shocking revelation from the Terminator, nor did any of the characters discuss it before heading off into the fight again.The other thing that hit me were the completely corny moments, two in particular stand out, the chance meeting of John Connor and his old school chum. How amazing was that considering that John Connor continually keeps moving and never stays in the same place? Then there was the need for the new Terminator to announce her findings of the DNA sampling to absolutely no one, despite the audience having already seen them flashed across her computer enhanced vision. American audiences I assume.In fact, the new Terminator isn't that scary or foreboding, and often she looks clumsy and awkward. Not a patch on the Terminator in T3, in fact none of the characters live up to their predecessors.I have heard talk of more sequels. I can only pray that James Cameron is out there, reading these, having watched the film, and decides he can't let the series be butchered again. Make another one, finish the series off and do it well Mr Cameron!",6,0,0,25 August 2003
American Beauty," Over-hyped, but still an excellent film. Shining stars and imaginative script.
","This film certainly looked like an American Beauty, the influence of the singular Cohen was evident through the dreamy scenes of Kevin Spacey and Mena Suvari which were just delicious to the eye.The first half of the film didn't raise too much from the audience, and it wasn't until Lester really began turning his life around did we all begin to warm to it. There seemed to be a lot of missed humour, maybe it was all too American for the Scottish audience. From there on in it was an excellent film.Spacey returned a good performance, although I thought he only really shone during the final scenes. Annette Benning, however, was fabulous, I think this is one of the best performances I've ever seen from her. 'I'm the King!' scene with Peter Gallagher was one of the funniest in the film.The ending caused quite a discussion in our group as to why, but I won't go into that here. Suffice to say I think this film is over-hyped, but still deserves much, much praise. Go see it.",8,0,0,9 February 2000
Spider-Man," Superb adaptation of the comic book hero, a few dodgy effects, but still good.
","A very cool film, encompassing humour, the darkness of the original superhero comics, and some slick action. It's a good story and a very good treatment, although the special effects aren't convincing in earlier scenes, and there are at least five boom shots that caught my eye. Apart from that it is a really good film. The story is entertaining and enjoyable, gripping you for the latter part.",7,0,0,16 October 2002
Collateral," Very good thriller, and superbly shot with the ever present Mann trademarks. Well worth watching.
","very well filmed thriller from Michael Mann who once again proves his mastery of Directing, with Tom Cruise being equalled for performance alongside Jamie Foxx. Cruise shows how good he is at portraying a bad guy, just as much as his good guy roles, if not better.The film starts off low key, and continues for the majority. Despite Vincent being a cold hired killer, his demeanour and relaxed, open attitude makes you feel that he's not that dangerous after all. At some point along the way I started wondering where this was going, I knew Cruise can play a great bad guy, but he wasn't really playing much at all, just any other character. Then I caught some of the subtleties of the character and the way he was calming and controlling Max.What was then interesting was where it went from there, where the story kicked off into high gear and the characters changed under the pressure of the night. There's even a growing understanding between the characters before the final sequences.Excellent action scenes and superb camera work with a fantastic score edited into the scenes adding another layer of tension and storytelling.Imagine a straight line through the centre of the plot showing predictability, this story follows that path, but instead of a straight line it curves back and forth crossing it throughout but always keeping that steer. So what you find is you expect something to happen and it does, just not at the time or in the way you thought, it's always just slightly off centre. That makes it interesting, and although there is predictability, it doesn't detract one bit from the movie or it's style.Let's face it Mann is about style and atmosphere, with a great score and some fantastic action sequences (check out the club scene), and this delivers. On top of that are the slower paced, low key scenes from the beginning which provide a great level of realism and character sympathies while setting the plot devices clearly in front of you.Very good thriller, and superbly shot with the ever present Mann trademarks. Well worth watching.",8,2,2,28 September 2004
Dark City," Excellent film, very dark, very moody.
","I really enjoyed this film from the outset and that feeling followed right through to the end. It had a very Kafka-esque feel to it, if I can say that without sounding pompous! You could really feel the characters uneasiness and Rufus Sewell and John Hurt turn in fantastic performances, and there are some fabulous camera shots and effects. There's an obvious comparison to The Matrix, it's not as rich on effects, but it sure makes up for it in mood and style.",8,0,1,30 October 1999
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Some good performances, but bad replacements. The better Potter movie to date.
","After finding that the second movie was much better then the first and then seeing the trailers for the third, I was really under the impression that the third would outshine the first two. The comments were that it was much darker and adult, and that was backed up by the trailer.Oh sure it was better than the Philosophers Stone, but better than Chamber of Secrets? Surely, with the more adult storyline and the darker mood, surely it was better. The Director had even been changed, and that could make it go either way.Well I wasn't so much disappointed as not excited enough. Yes, it was darker and much more for an adult audiences taste with an extremely clever plot, but there were still some problems with it all.Firstly, the eighty minutes of scene setting and build up, in that time we hardly see anything that's really concerned with the final part of the movie. Just the usual character settings and plot explanations.Then there are the standard plot deviations to explain something new about the Potter universe, and once complete we pop back into the story. This is fine, but in this movie I felt there was too much of that.Yet again, as with the other two films, there is the ending and the many unanswered questions. For example, why doesn't Professor Snipes say anything about Harry blasting him, what happens to the Dementors and why were they after Harry in the first place on the train? There are lots of these and mostly popping up nearer the end of the movie.There's also one of the major plot twists just happening with the wet fanfare of a single trumpeter. In fact the turn happens so quickly and without notice you do suddenly wonder why and what the hell just went on.Unfortunately, I do think Michael Gambon is a great actor, but not as Dumbledore, not as a replacement for the late Richard Harris. His acting and mannerisms are totally wrong for the part and present more of a bungling old man rather than the wise and all knowing character that Harris portrayed.Still, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson are very good in their roles. Also the effects were excellent in this movie, in particular the Dementors, the Hypocrate creature and once again the spider! The story overall is much more enjoyable and more representative of a movie plot line than the other two. The darkness and maturity also provide for a much stronger and watchable movie, however the shortcomings are still too much for me to overlook and really be taken into the film and the world of Harry Potter.I think it will now become very interesting as to how the stories progress with such obviously ageing actors in the lead roles and a new Director for the next movie and a new Screenwriter onboard after that. For me, I would like these changes to be for the better, although sticking with Alfonso Cuarón for another movie might have been a wise move.We can but wait and see. As for the DVD, the same issues are in this DVD as before, the extras are difficult to get to and you never really know what each menu option is for. However, it does have a very cool style to the navigation, but still no audio commentary!",6,3,4,17 January 2005
The Exorcist," Maybe too hyped, but still unnerving.
","Having heard all the hype about this film I was very surprised at how slow paced it all seemed, there's bags of time spent creating characters background and building up suspense. Characters and dialog are very real with nothing moving from the standard story until well into the film. Once the Green Pea soup hits the fan you suddenly realise why this was banned when it was, but I must point out that in the context of the story it never seems over the top, just very disturbing. Despite the re-release, it still seems like there are two gaping holes in the storyline, as though there are still some serious edits remaining. The acting is believable, Linda Blair is very convincing and Jason Miller portrays well a Priest with failing faith, a very good human portrayal. Very enjoyable and slightly unnerving, it almost lives up to its reputation.",9,1,1,7 February 2000
American History X," Shocking, moving and non-judgemental. It has a lot to say, listen.
","I couldn't say this film was entertainment, it's shocking, exciting, harrowing and handles subjects which are both controversial and yet extremely relevant in our society today.This just shows what a talent Ed Norton really is, from the two act film you can see his anger and hatred in the act one. Then the struggle as he tries to leave his past behind and the constant pressure society and peers place on him to stay what is was.I was struggling to relax from the opening moments of the film to the closing credits, and I was shocked at the end of it all. This has to be one of the best commentary's on our society today, you must watch it and just try not to be moved.",10,0,0,30 December 2000
Pearl Harbor," More history rewriting in an effects driven film.
","Oh dear, more liberties taken with history in the name of American patriotism. The effects of the attack are amazing, and it's very high adrenaline, but the love story has nothing at all to do with the story and just detracts from what could have been a good film. Much like Saving Private Ryan, and many other American war movies, they tend to forget who else was in the war, timelines, important events and causes, etc, etc. If you've nothing else to do then this is pulp entertainment to wash over you. Otherwise, go see something more historically correct!",3,0,1,16 October 2002
The Dirty Dozen," A well structured and interesting story, although poorly edited in the final act
","It's difficult when you approach an old movie to see it for the first time and you have to try and drop all the baggage associated with it from reviews and analysis over the years. The Dirty Dozen is such a movie. I just watched it for the first time last night on TV, clipped though it was for those smaller brained people among us who don't like to see dark bits at the top and bottom of their screens.It's interesting that there are three real character acts to this movie. There's the dark opening and character introduction, the fun act where the characters meld together into a team, and the closing act where the mission, and the war, become a stark and deadly reality. That last act is dark too, although there a couple of accidental laughs in there for the worst character expression at a death ever, and one particularly bad death scene.What does strike you about the opening is how really dark it all is. We're talking about murders who are looking at to be retrained. Indeed one is a rapist with a serious God complex who is bordering on utterly insane. They are about to be hanged for their crimes, but have one last chance. Poor Major John Reisman has no say in the matter, he has his band and has to make them work.It's well filmed for the first two character acts, and the acting is very good. John Cassavetes and Telly Savalas are wonderful in their roles. In fact it's a surprise to see Savalas in such a role and shining so brightly. Donald Sutherland also shows he has some excellent character acting in him. The rest are far from bad, but you can see a lot of typecasting for them.The movement from the dark opening to the more jovial training act is interesting to watch, as this is exactly how many of the characters are seeing it, as a bit of fun. What they aren't expecting is the third character act, that of the actual war itself, and for some this proves too much.The difficulty I had with the final act is only in the filming. There are premature cuts, awkward angles and jumping storytelling. So much is missed by the camera, and it doesn't feel like it's there to let your imagination run, it seems like someone has cut the film deliberately, and quite badly. There are quite a few scene transitions that just don't work at all.However, where it doesn't fail is bringing the characters to their ultimate journey, that of redemption and a renewed desire to fight for their Major, and their fellow men. They become soldiers, and indeed heroes.It's a good war film to watch, very well structured and reflective of the characters journeys. It's just that final act for me which spoiled my enjoyment, and purely in the filming of it.",7,45,65,20 February 2005
Batman Begins," Fantastically written and wonderfully filmed, despite confused fight sequences, perfect Batman.
","There are two important lessons to be learned from this movie. One is that this is the yardstick, the meter on which to measure every comic book or graphic novel adaptation. Forget Sin City with its style over substance, this is the way it should be done.If you've read Batman: Year One and you've seen this movie you'll see so much that has been transferred successfully. The plot has been changed, but they've used key scenes as well as characters and their development. Nolan has done a wonderful job of bringing the Batman movie franchise back to life.The second lesson is, unfortunately, a negative one, and one that is hitting most action movies pouring out of Hollywood and film makers are doing it more and more, increasing with each release. What am I talking about? It's action sequences. The action in Batman Begins was unwatchable. Both my girlfriend and I had no idea what was going on during the action sequences until they ended.In key fighting moments through the movie something was trying to be conveyed to the audience, the balance of power between Batman and his villain, when he battles Ducard and finally manages to beat him it's hard to see when the balance tips until the final moment. When he battles him again you see nothing but fast moving blurs and the odd grimaced face shot, the tension built by the rest of the sequence is totally lost.I have to say from the first announcement of the casting of Bale I was impressed, he was perfect. From that moment the fans were sure that they were going to be treated to a Batman in the vein of the original portrayed by Keaton, and they weren't wrong, but no one realised how good the whole movie was going to be.The rest of the casting is superb. I was amazed to see how well the great Oldman portrayed Gordon, having not long ago read Batman: Year One I just couldn't believe how well he fitted.I think it's fair to say the casting was perfect throughout, apart from one. I found it really hard to forget Dawson Holmes, although I have to say she did an exceptionally good job of taking us away from those memories and showing is a new character. Back to Bale. He's immense. If you can get over the mouth hanging open in his constant aghast look as Wayne, he does an amazing job as a dark and driven man. His presence in and out of the suit is strong, and does certainly remind me of the strength and madness stored in Keaton's Batman. Although where Keaton showed controlled madness, Bale shows a seething and almost an all consuming anger, brimming over the edges.Nolan has done a fantastic job of bringing the Batman back to the big screen, concentrating on the reality and grounding of Gotham and the character, before slowly building the believability into the fantastic world of the Bat and his villains. The early parts of the movie do a great job of showing how the reality of a boy's life is taken to that of the superhero. Without taking too huge a leap, it shows the devastating effect of the murder of his parents on his mind, and how that consumes him in search of vengeance, taking each small step to the training that shows him what he really needs to become the lone Dark Knight.I think that's a huge part of this movies success, it doesn't present a fantastical world or superhuman man, and this is the huge attraction of Batman in all his guises, he's human, nothing more than you or I trained to the peak of human endurance and capability, as well as supplied with expensive gadgets of course! The movie does a great job of taking us on that journey of what makes a man drive him to build himself to that level, and then the steps that bring him to that.The villains are also well crafted, and once again grounded very securely in reality as well as being built from the better side of the human psyche. Growing alongside the character of Batman. Scarecrow is particularly good, and not portrayed as too 'masky', you know what I mean he's not an over camped villain who's just totally insane, he's cold and calculating and like the Batman, uses his mask for a purpose.The relationship between Gordon and Batman is built early on, and Wayne's involvement with the Wayne Corporation is built as a nice side story. What I am surprised about is that so many people end up knowing the identity of Batman, in my mind there were only supposed to be two characters with that knowledge. However, it's not something that did affect the enjoyment, considering they've done such a good job for the entire movie, the slips aren't big enough to harm it.Some of the strongest scenes are those of the main characters together. Those of Gordon and Batman, Wayne and Ducord and Wayne and Alfred, the latter being the strongest scenes in the movie. The moments where Alfred comforts the young Wayne at the death of his father are stronger than I would expect from this genre, but they are extremely effective in building the character. The final moments of Gordon and Batman make seal the partnership and bring the beginning to the perfect end. Superbly written and crafted.The film is dark and claustrophobic, and effects and CGI are used as additions to the live action rather than as main sequences, no more is this apparent than in the car chase sequence with Batman's vehicle (I dread to call it the Batmobile), and with larger shots of the city. It's hard to notice where CGI has been used, which is how it should be.",8,0,1,10 July 2005
The Princess Bride," Beautiful, funny, moving and inspiring. A great film!
","A beautifully written screenplay with wonderful casting. A fairytale with a healthy supply of, sometimes more mature, comedy and its tongue clearly placed in its cheek. A superb film with giggles a plenty and a fantastic cast, and the most inspiring hero ever, you'll scream inside when his moment comes, Mandy Patinkin steals the show. Watch it!",10,1,3,12 August 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Harrowing, shocking and compelling.
","A harrowing journey which is amazingly filmed, edited and choreographed. The story drags you into it, even though you'll be shocked at the pain and tragedy these soldiers went through, and it makes you believe and feel for the characters like no other film I've seen in a long time.Hanks is wisely restrained, and the supporting cast are very good. I wonder if Spielberg is the talent that brings the best acting, rather than choosing the best actors around.The death scenes are unbelievably realistic, and are undoubtedly very unnerving. One scene remains in the mind long after you've seen it, and it's not the famous opening beach scene.Great realism which instills fear panic and confusion, almost a brilliant work of art if not for the forgetfulness for the other nations concerned.",9,0,0,12 January 2000
28 Days Later...," Starts well, but a poor characterised script lets it fall.
","This film starts out with high expectations; the opening scenes making you feel lost, out of place in familiar territory, and all alone. However, this quickly fades. As Jim is suddenly aware, and informed, a killer virus has wiped out almost all of the population, and you have to fight to stay alive, travel only in the daytime, and look after yourself, prepared to kill even your friends in the blink of an eye. Oh dear. Then comes the bad script, the really bad script. So after all this is said, what do the main characters do, even Selena who reiterates the very rules of the game? Yes. Walk into darkened areas alone shouting `hello', go for walks in the country, take valium to sleep all night, leave their weaponry to run around naked smelling of fresh blood. The characters contradict themselves on many occasions, and the hero just bumbles around pathetically. I shook my head in disbelief more times than I did for teen slasher flicks. There are some nice effects however, and the make up and filming are well done, even if the quality of the digital filming leaves a lot to be desired sometimes. Some of the plot is good, although you are reminded of a number of similar films and such like. The twist is nice too. Still, I would say, worth a miss.",3,0,0,20 November 2002
Hellboy," Very entertaining and fun throughout with a few laughs and great effects.
","*** Mild story indicator, but not a spoiler ***This film has been getting a lot of bad press, and to be honest I really can't see why.Okay, it doesn't have a very intricate plot that makes you think, fills you with dread or ensures you are leaping out of your seat (although I technically did twice, then laugh!). It does, however, give you a fun packed value for money movie.There are a good few laughs in it, and the special effects are excellent, sure there are a few moments when you see that Hellboy has suddenly become computer generated, but that's because we can still tell the difference, not because it was badly done. As for that, go spot when Abe is computer generated...no? Very good isn't it? Yes - well you cheated and searched on the Internet!Ron Perlman is just superb in this, and his makeup is stunning. He really seems to play a perfect character, and from what I've read, just like the comic book - although that doesn't have to be the case in movie adaptations of comics.*** The only thing I personally found slightly odd was the character of John Myers. Why was he there as he served no real purpose, and why were there a few references which hinted at him having some power but were left totally uninvestigated? Perhaps that's something for Hellboy 2! ***So, very entertaining, great fun and some good laughs throughout. The majority of characters are actually interesting and fun too. A very enjoyable movie, just make sure that's what you're wanting to get out of a movie trip that day and you'll like it. Oh, and stay after the credits!",7,2,3,27 September 2004
Good Will Hunting," An enjoyable and moving film, despite the fumbles of Affleck.
","A very good film, if somewhat unfulfilling and light in regards to the unexplored relationships from Will to Sean and Skylar. Robin Williams shows the beginnings of his serious, and sometimes darker, side. Matt Damon shows excellent promise, while Ben Affleck fumbles along as he has in many of his roles since. Still, it's a moving tale with some heartfelt scenes, particularly the defining moments between Will to Sean and Skylar.",7,4,9,25 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," What an awesome film, I found it hard to accept that they could better part oneand they did!
","This is filled with stunning visuals, of huge battles, landscapes and little creatures that love the darkness and their precious. The performances are wholly wonderful and pull you into the story without a second thought, with a plot that totally immerses you and will hardly let you take a breath until the very end. The effects are stunning, although some of the more distant people or crowd scenes were a bit noticeable; none of it takes away from the story. The grand scenes are so visually and emotionally rich, you can't help but feel affected by them, I was moved at quite a few scenes. There were internal cheers, genuine sympathy for characters, and an overwhelming emotion as the riders charge down the hill. This series is destined to go down in history, and no doubt they will all end in the top ten films of all time, if not five!",9,0,0,22 January 2003
The Incredibles," Wonderful, beautiful to watch, all in all, incredible.
","WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that's the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.I can't begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it's perfect. I mean you'll always be looking at it knowing it's animation, but when the story takes you along you'll suddenly realize you're still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.I often find that movies aren't paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven't read the graphic novel will be saying 'That's the Incredibles movie' when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they've produced before. Boundin' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible.",10,360,451,21 November 2004
The Game," Excellent thriller, twists and turns at every straight
","Excellent thriller with Douglas playing the embittered clueless victim trapped in a so called game with no escape, just a conclusion. This film has so many twists and turns you won't know who to believe and who not to, you'll be lost along with Douglas. It'll leave you confused and guessing right until the end. I don't want to give anything away, so there's not much more I can say, other than watch it, it's a beauty.",9,1,2,18 November 2000
Hero," Beautiful and visually stunning throughout with an excellent story.
","Interestingly for this film I walked in not knowing what the story for this would be. Usually the trailer gives everything away of the movie (see Aliens vs Predator for the entire story of the film in only one minute), however this trailer actually gave me a totally different idea from the movie. This ended up being just as bad for me as I was a bit disheartened at the beginning, but that didn't last.The tag lines are flying all over the place for the PR, '...most beautiful movie ever made...', etc. Well they really aren't wrong; this really is visually stunning and is just a joy to watch. The locations, the costumes, the movements of the actors, it's just all so luxurious on the eyes.Talking of the actors, the quality is superb. For me, Jet Li wasn't the strongest, it was by far Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword, followed by the very intimidating Daoming Chen, the King of Qin. Excellent jobs!Story wise, well I really am not going to summarise this movie, not that It'll spoil any plots, it's just that there isn't an easy way to do it credit in a short blurb. It's an excellent story however, and although you never really know what happened for definite, the journey is what makes this such a great movie.That, and of course, the beautifully filmed fight scenes. They are stunning, with some superb wirework that just rises above what has been seen in similar movies. Each single scene for the fights seems to have been thought of from a cinematic experience, and there is never a case where the fighting is there for the sake of it, each is there for a dramatic reason.The story plays out from multiple viewpoints, each presenting a different slant on the history leading to the opening point of the movie, and which do you believe?The beauty, I thought, is that all this just continues to build tension to the point you've been waiting for early on in the movie. The tiniest detail of the film represents a great moment, and the sparse dialogue helps to highlight each of these to perfection.I would thoroughly recommend this, it really is as it is billed, a spectacular movie. However, don't go expecting Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the story here is very different, and although there are a few similar themes, the story plays out very differently and is filmed in a very different way. Also, listen for the superb Japanese Drumming group in the soundtrack.Excellent movie, a must buy on DVD when it is finally allowed to be released  check out the original date of this movie release in the Far East!",9,2,3,27 September 2004
Moulin Rouge!," An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story actually begins.
","There has been much hype about this film, especially from friends, and I was very excited to see it, especially at the prospect of hearing Ewan McGregor sing! I must say however, that I was disappointed. I was told this is probably the film of the year, and it certainly is not, with the first half lacking direction and substance, merely a collection of big show scenes that seemed to be included for all lovers of musicals and stage shows. Hence why my friends loved it!At this point I must say that I am not a great fan of Baz Luhrmanns' Romeo and Juliet. The only real part I liked was the portrayal of the rival families. To me it seemed like an extended MTV music video. So this probably clouded my judgement somewhat.Saying that, once a semblance of a story begins, it begins to seem like a film, and a wonderfully entertaining one at that. To me, the two actors who shine through are Ewan McGregor, showing that he is truly a versatile actor, and Richard Roxburgh who plays the most fantastic baddie I've seen since Charles Dance.The music sequences are brilliant, and when the characters start speaking lines from songs, that added a nice touch to the film, especially since it's something all my friends do anyway!When the plot does kick in, it kicks in quickly, and although it's a simple story of love, it's well acted, scripted and directed, with the most amazing musical sequences.An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story begins.",7,1,2,13 September 2002
Wimbledon," Surprisingly funny and enjoyable. Well filmed and superb performance from Bettany.
","Straight off I have to make something clear, I wasn't really looking forward to watching this. A romantic comedy movie from some of the Working Title team based on Wimbledon didn't exactly set my pulse racing. I did not want another comedy from this stable, for me Love Actually had stretched the idea enough for me.So after seeing it I'm very surprised I enjoyed it so much. Despite the rom-com badge and the almost unbelievable premise of Wimbledon it's actually very entertaining and the focus is very much on the com side of that genre label.Movie The movie has a lot of style right from the very cool opening credits. The filming of the tennis scenes are well done and keep the flow of the movie going. Imagine showing all the crucial Tennis matches for two players climbing through the stages in Wimbledon without the story going dull and the cinematography going into a standard and repetitive style? Well it doesn't, it's almost matrix-esue in it's style in fact. For sports and romantic films, it certainly breaks the mould.Putting aside the style and the fast paced music, what about the story? Well it's actually got a few twists which are quite unexpected and although it does tread typical ground, the turns are enough to keep you guessing as to the outcome and keep you hooked.Neat the finals this really does come out and I was very surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat for some of the points, and indeed some of the matches.It's very funny too, and Paul Bettany shows a particular talent for timing, comedy and looks on camera. It's Bettany that really carries this movie backed by strong performances by Kirsten Dunst, Sam Neill and some smaller British filled roles for Bettany's characters family.Bettany is totally believable from playing the tennis matches through to the romantic moments. His acting talent shows through amazingly well and is aided by a fantastically written script with some truly funny moments. In particular the self talking moments when we travel inside the head of the tennis player during a match. They seem to capture perfectly the moments of self doubt we all seem to have, quite insightful.Sound Presented: English - Dolby Digital (5.1) Sporting an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack at times you can hear the ground around you applauding, or the sound of a ball going past. When a moment of dialogue appears everything is dialled down and there's no attempt at over use.Picture Presented: Widescreen 2.35:1 Anamorphic Something that struck me was the potential to have the screen be overpowered by the greens of Wimbledon and with the traditional weather there was a thought that the movie would look too dark and dull. Neither is true.The picture is sharp and vibrant through the movie, clear and bright and very colour rich, it retains this look through even the more complex of special effects match shots.Extras Presented: Audio commentary with Richard Loncraine and Paul Bettany, 'Welcome To The Club' featurette, 'Ball Control' featurette, 'Coach A Rising Star' featurette, 'Wimbledon: A Look Inside' featurette, Trailers The featurettes are about how the tennis was filmed, how the actors were trained, looks inside Wimbledon itself, and some further looks into the movie. They are quite short and interesting, but they aren't the main draw here, they just serve as distractions from the superb audio commentary from Bettany and the director Richard Loncraine.Insightful, funny and quite revealing, we hear much about the behind the scenes, shots that never were and how the actors got on together. This was one of the better commentaries I've heard and well worth listening to. Both Bettany and Loncraine are funny and self depreciating, typical British humour.Overall It's a funny and very enjoyable movie, actually quite a surprise and in a way actually funnier than Love Actually. It also seems to capture the inner dialogues that people face daily very well, as well as some of the other dialogue being nailed rather well. Bettany shines in this film and it shows the huge talent that he has.",8,37,47,7 October 2005
Rules of Engagement," Interesting and thought provoking, but fails to really investigate the issues it raises.
","As always, Samuel L. Jackson is intense and powerful, his performance demonstrates his superb acting ability in portraying his characters stubborn and honourable ways. Unfortunately, I couldn't help but feel that Tommy Lee Jones was out of place within his role. He almost seems as though he should be placed in a similar role to Samuel L. Jackson. Then again maybe I missed the point, his character begins life that way, and being forced to be an army lawyer creates this placing unease.The film is exciting and thought provoking, yet I can't help think that there is a lot of film left lying on the cutting room floor. Not that the story is incomplete, but more that it lacks focus on some crucial points throughout.Although slightly different to 'A few good men', another cracking good army courtroom drama is made, and this one attempts to cover some serious issues and our views of the people we send out to fight for us. It's worth a watch.",6,0,1,26 November 2001
The Evil Dead," A cult horror, and a funny one at that. Great use of a low budget.
","A cult classic, almost as soon as it was initially shown. Now, however it is cheesier and sillier, even with the inclusion of the tree attack scene. The acting is awful, it's hard to believe the directors are being honest when they say that it was meant to be more horror than fun. It still manages to deliver scare, shock and horror well, and the gore factor is high, despite the low budget. There are some really interesting scenes that have been imaginatively thought out, and some bizarrely funny bits too. Well worth a look.",8,1,2,16 October 2002
8 Mile," A lighter film than expected, a street feel good movie. Enjoyable none the less.
","I was very surprised by the lightness of the film, having heard that this was the unofficial story of how Eminem started, and hearing how tough and violent his life had been, I had thought this film was going to be far grittier and tougher than it was. As it stands, I was surprised by the ease of the life of the character, he had a job, his Mum was actually not that bad, and many of the fights that were started were purely down to him. However, that said about the story, the Rap battles were powerful and enjoyable, and some of the scenes have surprising humour  I laughed so much when the poor guy shot himself. Eminem also shows a good talent for acting; although one would suspect he is simply playing the character he played most of his life. Overall, a good movie, but if, as the title song suggests, you have one chance at making it, this characters chance wasn't that apparent. A not truly bad family life, and life just seems to turn around for everyone before our hero's chance seems to arrive, and after all that it doesn't seem like a payoff after all, especially for something that promises a feel-good pay off.",6,0,1,10 February 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A strong revisitation of the classic, although quirkier and slightly updated.
","The original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder in the lead is somewhat of a classic for many people, and much like with The Planet of the Apes, I just didn't think it should be remade, or indeed could be.Yet in this version the story is very close to the original and only deviates in some places.There's the same degree of oddness as well as good fun but also there's an added adult level to play to which is rather quite effective.The whole movie proves to be very close to the original except for the ending which takes the story in a new and altogether well fitting direction.Johnny Depp is surprisingly good as Wonka. I have to say that when I first saw and heard him in character I made a mental comparison to Wilder and rejected him immediately. Yet during the film he managed to pull the character off really well portraying stupidity alongside a calculating, almost malevolent quality. He certainly has captured a completely quirky and non-grown up persona.Freddie Highmore is also very good, not being too sickly sweet but capturing that childhood innocence very well. The other children stand strong alongside him, but none truly shine.One of the notable things about the movie is the addition of a new family and Golden Ticket winner, the TV family. To modernise the movie the child is a mind of information and has assembled it all through watching TV and also playing videogames. It's slightly twee in the concept, but it works well.Although there are these tweaks and updates to the story, it's not harmed the movie any and still retains a lot of the feel of the original. You feel the emotion when Charlie shares his Birthday chocolate bar with his family or when he finally finds the Golden Ticket, or even when Wonka meets his Father against and we understand some of his quirks.Tim Burton has done a good job and given us a very entertaining family film and pulled another excellent performance from Depp. A very good revisitation of the story, surely set to be the replacement on the Christmas TV list.",7,0,1,29 January 2006
Big Fish," Wonderful movie, with the Burton-esquire controls turned slightly down for a moving father-son experience
","What a movie. I am not entirely sure what I was expecting considering this is a Tim Burton movie, but I was drawn to it since it stars Ewan MacGregor and Albert Finney.What I found was a surprise. Although it packs the usual Burton bizarreness, it contained a lot of simple family drama, and in particular analysis of the ever present Father-Son relationship issues.It struck me that the usual bizarre facet to Burton didn't end up controlling this movie, nor did it overpower the sections which contained it. In fact in the context of the story they were very accessible and unintrusive, and more to the point they were extremely relevant to the plot.The tall tales were very much part of the story, part of the Fathers life, and this is what the Son could never understand. He felt he didn't know who his Father was, and to an extent he never. However the conclusion and how the story comes to it's double end is wonderfully satisfying, and for a man who has experienced any similar type of relationship (which could be high in the 90% mark I would think) very, very moving. I was so moved I was bubbling like mad! It's also interesting how you travel on this journey through the movie. When it began I was struggling with the story and felt very much outside it with the movie failing to pull me in. Little by little however, it did, and before I knew it I was enjoying each of the little quirky tales of the Fathers past and looking forward to the next.The performances are very good, from MacGregor and Finney in particular, Jessica Lange also puts in a wonderful performance with little words, but pulling off a very natural and strong performance, it's hard to believe how beautiful she still looks, stunning.",8,1,1,20 January 2005
Green Street Hooligans," Gritty, violent, stylish, poor lead accent and slightly weak opening performance from Wood
","Gritty, violent, stylish, but in no way does it glorify the lifestyle. The bad is shown to so heavily outweigh the good, and when people fight they get hurt. There's not that much good to be seen in the movie, but it is a very good movie, and I would think something which captures the feelings and beliefs of these groups of people very well.The opening fight scene is pretty harsh, and I have to say the only 'enjoyable' fight scene of the film. Now by enjoyable, I mean in a Hollywood entertainment sense, because the violence in this movie is so real, you don't want to think that it fits the standard Hollywood template of violence and glorify it in anyway, however this scene does slightly, and perhaps to grab the audience because hereafter you'll be shocked and uneasy.The second fight scene of the movie deserves pointing out as well, because it combines some great filming effects and camera work to provide a different look to a scene shot so many times before. It's hand-held and close up, and these things are not my particular favourite in Hollywood fight scenes, because you miss so much you have to end up guessing what's happening, I wish they'd look more to Asian movie makers on how to do this right. However the style in this scene comes through with the use of a couple of effects which make the whole fight seem quite surreal, perhaps how the main character views it. It really gave some excitement and confusion to the scene, yet keeping the feeling of violence very real, and very nasty.Now, onto perhaps two of the most controversial parts of the movie, and no, I've already talked about the fighting and that's not one of them. Firstly the casting of Elijah Wood as the American who discovers this world of Football Firms. Many people are saying that he just doesn't suit the movie, that he's totally out of place, well I agree but only to a point. Yes, for most of the film he's out of place, his laughing moments seem awkward, like those moments when you tell a joke and your foreign friend doesn't catch it but laughs anyway because everyone else does. You see, I think perhaps he is supposed to be looking totally out of place and awkward here, I mean he's come from Harvard and is a Journalist, why would that make him feel easy in amongst UK organised Football Hooligans? He has redemption though, in the final act of the film he faces a tough decision, and I really do believe it's from this point on that he comes into his element and gives a very good performance. Still, there is that stigma associated with his most famous role to date, and it's very prominent here. The 'fish out of water' style and awkwardness is also easily taken as bad acting, that said I could be wrong and it could actually be bad acting! The second controversial part of the movie is something that perhaps only people in the UK will grab, Charlie Hunnam's accent. His cockney accent is pretty bad, there are moments when he settles into it, but there is a distinct feeling that he's over pronunciation much of what he's saying, particularly the Cockney inflections.However, putting the accent to the side his performance is really good and very convincing, when you see him give an order, take control of a situation or in the midst of a fight, you believe who he is 100%. Without a doubt he appears strong and single minded, and a very violent character.Yet for me, it's Leo Gregory that steals the screen. His performance as Bover is totally immersive and you're drawn to him on screen. If I remember Lexi Alexander, the Director and Writer, introduced him at the Q&A after the EIFF premiere as the UK's answer to Sean Penn, and you can see why. He has all those qualities that draw you to Penn. Let's hope he's recognised for it.Both Marc Warren and Claire Forlani are just as convincing and give strong performances, I've always liked Warren as an actor and Forlani is a new find for me. These two have a good chemistry, although not all that you'd expect from a married couple, Forlani gives an emotional performance.Geoff Bell as Hatcher, the leader of the Millwall Firm, is a true psycho. Totally broken and void of the understanding of morales, you can see he's consumed by complete hatred and anger. He just seemed such a real character and a truly scary man! The ideas of retribution, morales and karma are very strong throughout this movie. It's an example of how good the script is when you can understand the allure of the Firm for the character of Buckner, as well as see and understand the bonding between the members. It does a lot for the audience to help them understand the reasoning behind it all, and this is where I think the controversy for Hollywood lies. These are the parts that can be viewed as portraying a positive light on the Football Firms rather than the actual fighting, and it's not hard to see that. Yet I do think it's balanced by the retribution and karmic endings shown.Overall a strong movie, although Wood's casting is very unusual and seems quite awkward during the first two acts of the film, coupled with the poor accent of the lead Englishman and there lie the negative aspects. The story, portrayal of the Firms and the violence itself all give for a strong and hard hitting movie, although perhaps more attractive to a British audience.",6,3,7,27 August 2005
Toy Story 2," Good fun, characters return with an interesting twist, perhaps even better than the original.
","I couldn't actually believe that I hadn't seen Toy Story 2 when it popped up on Television at Xmas, it seemed so long ago and since I enjoyed Toy Story so much there was no reason not to have seen the follow up. Yet I hadn't, for some strange reason it had dropped off my list of what to watch, so I sat down with a glass of something nice and red and returned to the world of toys.There's nothing too different about this movie from the first apart from the storyline itself, the characters and their voices are all the same, and they've recaptured them perfectly for this movie. Probably the only negative point of the similarity is the animation, CGI has moved on since Toy Story and it shows a little here, however what is good is that the animation of Toy Story has a unique quality to it and even if you were to see a few seconds without any recognisable characters you would know it was a Toy Story movie. So although the animation appears slightly dated (especially seeing it years after release) it does help to pull you into that world again.Cleverly though the writers have looked at the world of toys and looked for other challenges that they would face if they really were alive, and they've come up with some superb ideas. They've created situations and scenes that are extremely imaginative and yet so obvious (if you were a toy), and what they've pulled out of these are some great performances for the characters and actors, and some genuinely funny moments. Often with a sequel you are treated to an inferior story and less laughs (with a comedy anyway, with other genres you often get more laughs!) but what they've done here is to raise the bar over the original Toy Story, and frankly it was something I just couldn't believe they could do.The characters are genuinely lovable and understandable, it's all too easy to get attached to them and be pulled into their world. Before long you find yourself caring for them and you'll be feeling their highs and lows, and even a small lump in the throat at times.There were a few nods to other movies in here, again I won't spoil it by listing them, but they added to the adult factor of the film, something which Pixar has really managed to comprehend. They manage time and time again to make a movie which appeals to both children and adults together without any clash of the two. It will certainly be interesting to see where the Disney only sequel will go.Overall it's a very satisfying movie giving you everything you want from a good family movie, whether you be a kid or an adult, or even somewhere in between, it's a great fun movie with some good laughs, and definitely on a par if not better than the original.",8,0,1,4 January 2006
Saw," Cleverly crafted, exciting, dreadful and disturbing...I saw.
","Wow! This movie was an upper and downer for me. The score was all over the place throughout the movie, and in most circumstances that is a good thing, and it is here too.Once you've seen the entire piece you do see that the script is excellently put together, and you are left with a shed load of questions afterwards, wondering and confused but with that childish excitement of realisation.Well filmed, it's dark, enclosed and precise with what you should see, more and more pieces of the puzzle. There are some interesting styles of filming, but one excellent one which I am so sure I've seen before somewhere else, the use of a camera flash to repeatedly illuminate a room. It's well done, and keeps the you feeling in that closed, dark and controlled manner.I was very happily surprised, after a couple of stock Hollywood plot points which really hit me and got me thinking I was in a poor attempt of a movie, there are surprises which just make you look wide eyed at the screen and the slow dawn of realisation. Very, very well done.Downsides? Well, for me one was Cary Elwes. The accent and acting kept popping me back into reality every now and again. It didn't quite hit the mark of reality enough to keep me in the movie for him. However, that was far from spoiling it for me.The two Hollywood script writing moments did annoy me though, in such a well crafted film to see these two moments which are stock library scenes dropped in merely to help the story along really did bite in, and that's what dropped the score for me. If they could have just seen that and worked something else in their place this film would have been wonderful.Cleverly crafted, exciting, dreadful and disturbing, an excellent film that surely lets James Wan print tickets galore for himself from now on.",9,0,1,15 October 2004
The Last Samurai," Wonderful, powerful movie with amazing performances and an insightful look to Japanese history.
","I was biased from the get go on this movie, totally biased. Tom Cruise playing a hero again, and a movie where the Americans go and teach the Japanese how to fight. I just saw a big epic with Cruise-isms all over it and another movie where anything about the historical aspect of the Japanese is lost in a parade of how great America is and how they saved Japan. I was wrong, incredibly so.The first thing you realise about this movie is that Cruise is going somewhere he's good at, a tormented, bleak and actually quite dark character. For me, these are his best roles. Not the smiling, charming character that's made him so famous, but the kind of character we've seen him play only a few times, and each time he's brought something unique and truly superb to the screen. At that point I perked up and paid a little more attention, this was actually going quite well.After that the next major surprise is that this is not an all American movie, it talks of the massacre of Custer, but also of the massacre he inflicted on so many innocent Indians. No, this does not treat history with an all American paintbrush. At this point I had hope for a good movie, then the unthinkable happened.The movie turns to the Japanese, and looks into their traditional way of life with reverence, intellect and a surprisingly deep understanding. It turns the story around and takes the American deep into the heart of the Japanese Samurai and shows his slow understanding of their customs, traditions and way of life. This treats the Japanese with so much respect you wouldn't think it was a Hollywood movie at all. It was at this point I was noticed leaning forward in my seat at key moments of the movie, keen on not missing a second. I was enthralled.During the movie Cruise looses his big name status and becomes an interesting and deeply engaging actor here, only bettered by the intensity of the amazing Ken Watanabe. I'd never seen this actor before, or rather I'd never singled out his presence in a movie, but here he positively steals every scene he enters into, giving the complete feeling of a real Samurai set on a single course and almost welcoming the fate the Emporer has dealt him. He's deliberate, controlled but there's so much warmth in his performance it's wonderful to watch. Yet that's not to put down the performance of Cruise, he shares the screen wonderfully and shares many of the amazing qualities of Watanabe.The visuals are stunning, beautifully lit, visualised and filmed and the respect for the Japanese and their culture just pours onto the screen from the locations, sets and the smallest of details. The action is slow and measured with larger set pieces orchestrated so beautifully and never distracting from the morality of the tale. At all times it seems that the core of the movie, the Bushido, the way of the Samurai, is kept at the forefront of every scene and the movie makers have crafted the movie so carefully and precisely, as the Samurai would craft their blades.Edward Zwick proves here that he is one of the best Directors in Hollywood. He not only captures a script on film, but he delves into it and understands the story, its surroundings and history and brings it to life in the most epic of ways. He seems to totally drop the modern Hollywood movie production style and really steeps himself in the lore of the story and brings the production to the story, rather than making the story match the production.This movie really has seemed to have been developed with total respect for the history of the Japanese Samurai, and has been crafted together with a real love for movies and the story itself. I can't praise the movie enough, not only is it a wonderfully engaging and immersive tale, but it also carries with it many morales both of the traditional Japanese way of life, and the twisted ways of modern man. It carries with it exceptional performances and amazingly dramatic scenes which are beautifully captured on film throughout the movie. There really isn't a dull, wrong or even Hollywood moment in the movie.The DVD extras are extensive. On the first disc there's a very interesting commentary by the Director Edward Zwick, which provides some great insight into the making of the movie, smaller scenes and some of the actors, as well as getting across his enthusiasm for the great Japanese warriors and their history.The second disc gives us two deleted scenes, both with commentary by Zwick, and one with a how did we do it section, both interesting to see and understand why they weren't included. However, the interesting thing here is not to judge the extras on the content of any one, all the extras ad up to provide a hugely insightful exploration of the movie, actors, and Japanese history. The ideas and comments on one of the extras will come through again and again, referenced throughout bringing together a much larger experience of the movie.Also on the second disc are a number of features examining the costumes, sets, Japanese history, Samurai and Bushido, the actors including Cruise's training to become a convincing Samurai swordsman, and an interesting discussion between Cruise and Zwick, slightly indulgent at times, but very interesting.The movie is wonderful and the extras are a hugely satisfying addition to the film itself. This is definitely a must watch, and a must watch again.",10,1,2,28 May 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Satirical comment on a society years before it arrived.
","More relevant in today's society than it was when it was made, visually exciting and extremely thought provoking. Not as shocking as all the hype would suggest, and the violence all falls by the wayside when the morality and thoughts on reform pull together. The beauty and taste of an orange is all but gone when it's man made. The characters are incidental to the story, and at times I found them intensely annoying, maybe that was intended. An amazing take on today's society, made well before things got this bad.",6,0,1,2 August 2000
National Treasure," A contrived, hand holding movie that demeans the audience placed in a very strong DVD offering.
","I never really thought much of this movie from the moment I saw the opening ten minutes that the Studio posted on the Internet, the conclusions of the main character to work through the puzzles were completely wild and speculative, grasping at straws the audience had even conceived, and it just made the writing seem extremely dumb.When I saw the whole movie I wasn't far wrong, the person I watched it with actually fell asleep during the movie. So why the score you might ask, well that's down to the DVD itself. It's a superbly interactive DVD that can keep you amused for sometime, encouraging you to work through all the additional materials to figure out the clues contained within.As for the movie...well...Movie The opening speaks for itself. Once past the short sequence to set the scene for who the main character is and what they are searching for, you're propelled into the middle of the frozen wastes where the team finds a ship buried over two hundred years ago in snow and ice within inches of the surface of the current snowfall. Plus, the identification clue happens to be on the very part of the boat that is sticking so close to the surface, just where the character digs. Already you know this is going to be one dumb movie.It goes on with the ease in which the character deciphers clues and his ludicrous recitement of how they are worked out. Just like reciting a script rather than fathoming out a problem, he speeds through it and the audience is left wondering what just happened and how.Every solved problem from here is over explained and the audience hand held through the finding. The series of events is so over explained that there's no real feeling of involvement in the discoveries, apart from the attempt to reveal the map on the back of the declaration. This leaves the audience just to watch the events pass by them one by one.What this then means is that there's no big surprise when we come to the revealing of the treasure room, or the twist just prior. There's no sense of urgency and discovery, this is nothing like an Indy treasure hunt, this is like following a satellite photo treasure map using GPS trackers. You just head there via various points and there you go.There's a big action sequence in the middle of the film, and this is (as is always the case in Hollywood nowadays) comprised of close-ups and fast cuts, making it hard to follow.Overall the movie is thoroughly disappointing, and the reworked ending very poor.Picture Presented: 2.35:1 Anamorphic The picture is good throughout, and copes well with some very realistic lighting conditions, particularly with torches as the source light.Audio Presented: Dolby Digital 5.1 The audio is really good on this movie. It's big with some good LFE mix. A good use of the directional sound offered with 5.1, as the sound moves around you a fair bit and then really pounds you at crucial moments, filling the room.Extras Presented: Deleted Scenes, Various Making of Featurettes, Opening Scene Animatic, Alternate Ending, Additional information on Treasure Hunters, the Knights Templar and a Trivia Viewing of the movie. The extras are within multiple hidden areas, watching the content from one will give you the codes for the other, it takes a little while to get through, but at least this gives you the feeling of being involved if the movie didn't. Deleted Scenes - These are okay, nothing special and just two in all. Featurettes - As standard, mostly the made for TV promotions you see. Animatic Opening - This is quite interesting, seeing the computer rendered version of the opening sequence used early on in the production as a placeholder for when the final effects were completed. Alternate Ending - What's interesting is that this ending is much stronger and less Hollywood than the one actually used, and they should have used this one. However maybe that would have not held with the outlook of the rest of the film. Treasure Hunters, Knights Templar - Both these extras are very informative and educational, and are well worth a watch. These two extras are two of the best items on the DVD. Trivia Viewing - This allows you to watch the whole movie again but this time with little popups telling you some interesting and educational facts about what is actually going on in the film. Some are wildly off topic, but they are very interesting and made me watch the movie again.Overall This movie is pretty poor. It's nice to look at, and some of the scenes are good, but overall it's hand holding and treating the audience as idiots. I'm sure it's wholesome young family fun, but definitely not for those who like something a bit more engaging in their movie experience.What does make this package though is the DVD offering and the way it is put together. Decoding sections of the DVD in order to find the hidden content really does make you want to delve in and solve it, and therefore go through the content. For the most part it's average, but two of the featurettes and the Trivia viewing are educational, informative and actually really quite interesting. It's here that the DVD makes up some serious ground for me.",3,2,4,8 December 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Not a great reminder of Kubrick, nor of the actors!
","A long, self-involved, film that shows you the hidden side of a couple on the fringes of high society. Interesting? Yes. Enjoyable. No. So much happens in this film that you just don't care about, and Kidman squeaks and screetches her way through the script so much that you just wish her off screen all the time while Cruise seems to be trying to deliver his most restrained performance of all time. Sure, it's an engaging story, but none of the outcomes or discoveries really excite you or interest you. Indeed at the final outcome, the hinge of the entire story, I just wanted them to shut up and get off the screen. Not a good sign, and not a good film.",4,2,4,16 October 2002
The Descent," Superb horror with scares and surprises aplenty, real characters, dialogue and actions.
","Neil Marshall is a supreme talent in horror that should not be ignored, especially by Hollywood who did just that with Dog Soldiers and is repeating it with The Descent, both of which have not had US cinema releases For his second movie he's decided to stay with horror but this time dropping the fun factor and relying on pure horror, scare tactics and something he's proving to excel in, a very strong and realistic script. Something that hit me during the early scenes of the all female climbing group sitting in their cabin chatting, is the realism of their vocabulary and delivery. It's something that was obvious in Dog Soldiers as well and it appears that Marshall has a talent for this. He picks actors who are not widely known but have a knack for a natural style, and then gives them some of the most natural scripted lines I've heard in a long time. It's very refreshing and very obvious, making it stand apart from many other films in and out of this genre.From the outset Marshall tells us in no uncertain terms that there's no fun in this film, this is going to be hard, in your face horror. Oh, and expect the scares to be off tempo and unexpected. No matter how atune you think you are to avoiding jumping, shouting out, or just sitting with a grimace on your face, he'll hit you just about every time in this movie. It's scary and very dark.One of the interesting things about this movie is how dark it is, they used as many realistic light sources as they could through the movie. That means the head torches of the pot holers, flames, torches, etc. Frankly I can't imagine that they got away with realistic lighting throughout, but you certainly have that feel from beginning to end.The whole movie gives you the feeling of enclosed spaces, darkness and the total loss of any bearings. For the most part you realise that the team are going in and deeper, but when trouble begins you loose all sense of direction and depth along with the characters.Once again the creatures in the movie are superb, not over the top like other horror offerings of the same ilk, but grounded in reality. Again Marshall has looked at the creature of the movie and worked out what it would look like and how it would behave based more on science and our real world than folklore and fantasy. What he comes up with is a strangely unnerving creature which isn't as all powerful as other films would have, and is real enough to prey upon your own fears rather than allowing you to distance yourself from it with the comfort of that very word, fantasy.The editing goes a long way to providing us with the shocks and scares on an offbeat tempo. You'll be expecting something, and nothing happens, you'll be expecting nothing, and then the audience screams or leaps. There are more than just scares in the movie though, there are plenty of surprises, twists and quite a few 'oh my god' moments, all extremely well crafted, written, edited and directed onto the screen.As for the talent of the female cast, there's not much to fault them. They are all so believable in their terror and confusion, but particular attention should be paid to MyAnna Buring as the lead, Sam, who takes you on a fantastic change of character, as does Natalie Jackson Mendoza. There's also the super sexy Alex Reid who has some fantastic lines early on in the movie. Nora-Jane No one also gives a superb and agonising performance during a few scenes where gasps and groans were echoing through the audience - that Marshall is a nasty man.What I really like about this movie is the reality of it all, okay there are some belief suspension moments, but we're not talking parasitic worms that grow into forty foot winged beasts, we're talking something that isn't that far from what could actually occur. Then there's the characters themselves who speak and behave as you think you just might too, and it's that part that really grabs me into Marshall's movies. He's got a realistic script combined with actors who deliver realistic performances. With these positives in the movie you're hooked, pulled in, and there's nothing to distract you from being thrown around with the movie.The ending is another strong part of the movie, it's also very well conceived, and you'll be sitting watching the credits roll still thinking about the movie, you'll even have walked away and still be thinking about it. You might feel slightly cheated, but I believe that's because we're too used to having everything handed to us on a plate in Hollywood, and this is perhaps why Hollywood hasn't taken either of Marshall's movies as yet, because they don't follow their standard movie template.Looking back on the movie, I'd like it to have had a little bit more - and please excuse the expression - meat on it. Tying something more in with the main character and her state of mind, as well as the opening of the film, and perhaps a tiny little bit more on the ending of the movie would have made it perfect for me. I think it does a superb job in the horror\scare departments, but there was room for a bit more psychological based subplot, perhaps involving more character interplay.",9,1,3,7 August 2005
Hoosiers," Full of passion and heart.
","This film is primarily about Basketball, but don't let that fool you, I have no interest in the game but I was yanked into it and was feeling the passion of the coach, players and the town all the way through.The underlying thread is of forgiveness and second chances. You never really know what was behind the need for these second chances, but that doesn't matter, you feel for these people, and a lot of that is to do with Gene Hackman.One of my favourite actors, Hackman pulls off a fantastic performance here, with an amazing backup from Dennis Hopper. What a combination.Passion, guts, determination, and without too much of a sickly taste in the mouth. A lovely film to watch.",7,19,25,30 December 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A poorly constructed film with much storyline confusion
","I had a dim view of the Potter series of books for sometime now, with a mixture of reading reviews and total rebellion at the complete overhype of them. However I'd recently sat down and started thinking about how biased and closed those ideas were and thought that I should at least give them a go. Never happened though, and I committed myself to watching the first movie in the DVD Boxset which I gave my girlfriend for her Christmas.Well, it does have a lot of the traditional elements of a kids adventure yarn, and there are some exciting moments, but for me the story was far too packed with ideas and unexplored side stories. There were flat, pantomime characters, and quite a few unexplained events and character choices, things just seemed to happen without any prior warning with the explanation being left to the very end. A very sloppy story telling device when the writer has backed the characters into a corner or has run out of time.Some of the animation work was excellent, and yet the main scene of Quidditch was quite poor with all the animation being shown from a distance and at high speed. It really did look like the video game version, and there is perhaps all the answer we need.Still, there was some adventure to be had, and some of the action was good, however equally editing on some of the action left a lot to be desired and simply confused events or served to pad them out without interest. A lot of these moments there was a feeling of cost or effects budget strain.",4,1,3,26 December 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Too fast paced, some poor moments, but darker and scarier than the others to date.
","Straight up though I have to say, I wasn't as impressed at this movie as I was by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, for me that movie is still the best of the Harry Potter series, but now not by much. For this movie is a very close second.It is, as everyone seems to agree, much darker than the other movies and I really do like this aspect. It's a well written story, and seems to lead things well to the next instalment. The tension and suspense are built well throughout, towards a strong and fitting climax. Some have said that the ending is confusing if you haven't read the books, I do disagree although you'll obviously have had to have seen the movies.The effects are superb, and the best of the series to date. You just have to watch the Dragons in action to understand what I mean, they are stunning creations and totally believable too. As are the effects in the underwater sequence, a sequence that is well edited and provides one of the most powerful and scariest moments of the film. This is surely where its rating comes from. Yet it's a perfect scene to provide the more adult issues facing Potter and his friends, and shows that his life is becoming more serious and more involved with events outside of his school world.However, there are issues I have with this movie and some with the whole series itself. For instance, Potter is a wizard and he's in a wizard school, and yet you hardly ever see him casting spells and he openly says that his strong point is flying. I don't get this, and I realise there are differences in the books, but I'm talking about the movies, and in these he appears as a bottom of the class wizard. Indeed this is the first time I remember him casting successful spells. Then, with all that, he goes on to fight one of the most powerful creatures in the universe, or so we're led to believe. For me that's quite a leap in the story.This last battle also comes to a very contrived ending which seems far too convenient, appearing as it does out of absolute nowhere. It's a 'get out clause' that appears just in time and is explained later on. For me this reeks of the characters being written into a corner and a quick backdoor being created for them. I really didn't like this moment.The entire movie seems harshly and overly edited, there was barely time to keep up as we leapt from pivotal scene to pivotal scene with rarely a breather for character development or backstory. You could tell this has been seriously cut down. Scenes seemed to begin late and end early, with characters just appearing ready to go. For me this didn't have the affect of keeping up the pace but actually harming it and racing on too fast with the story.The acting is interesting among the younger cast in this movie, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have an awkwardness about him, and perhaps that's him playing the character, but it's apparent in most scenes where emotions are called for.Emma Watson will have to mature some and learn to tone down her acting, for she was guilty of overacting at times. Yet I can see her becoming a big star in the future. She has the looks and you can see great performances in her.Surprisingly it was Rupert Grint that provided the best performance from the young cast for me. He just seemed so natural in every scene, and so believable.Overall I was impressed by the effects and the darkness of the story, yet the editing and the too pacey story meant that I didn't have time to follow the pace of the movie rather I had to race to keep up. I suspect this may take another viewing to appreciate it, or perhaps even a fuller DVD version, but for me this falls in as the second best Potter movie to date.",6,0,0,5 December 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.
","This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.",10,176,213,13 September 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An enjoyable movie if not for the unanswered questions and poor ending
","I hate to say it, but this was actually quite good, and definitely far better than the first movie. The characterisation is much better, although they still carry through a few too many ideas and there is, once again, a problem at the end with tying up the loose ends far too quickly and neatly but still leaving too many unanswered questions.There's a lot more darkness and levity to this story, and less concentrating on the pure kids element, which I think is beneficial for the the audience of adults and children alike.The effects are also ramped up a notch from the first, and with no overly CGI effect scenes like the Quidditch match, they are all quite believable. Almost too much for me in the case of the spiders.Kenneth Branagh is particularly enjoyable on screen, and plays a thoroughly comedic character, something he does very well considering the majority of his performances. Robbie Coltrane provides my second favourite performance in this episode, and he comes across as a thoroughly likable giant. Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs outperforming each other on the creepy, slimy stakes, Emma Watson as Hermione is much less eyebrow and annunciation. It has to be said the casting is extremely good.All in all an enjoyable movie, despite the ending tie ups and the unanswered questions, it does hold up well. Just not something I would particularly want to watch again.",6,0,1,30 December 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Good evenings entertainment with the shining coupling of two perfectly matched actors
","It's interesting that I saw this on opening night and have since forgotten about writing a review about it, for me that says a lot about a film. You could feel it fading as you left the cinema and even talking about it with friends twenty minutes later you found each other reminding yourself about scenes.For me that shows one of two things, the film was bad or it was pure entertainment which, although it can be enjoyable, just washes over you and lets you walk away without getting in your head and making a big impact. For Mr and Mrs Smith it was the latter.There's something that hits you about this film straight away in the opening scene, and it follows through the whole movie making it much more than it really is. The acting and chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. On screen they play off each other perfectly, and if you forget the movie and everything that's happening around them for the moment, you can be reminded of one of those great on screen couplings from the older days of Hollywood. Together they are classics. Really, I'm not selling this too high, the opening scene nails it in terms of performance, their timing and playing off of each other is perfect and brings forward the sharp, incisive comedy in the script. There were many a nervous laugh from couples in the audience, and the singles laughed much harder! That's what makes the film for me, with any two other actors I think the movie would have ridden an even keel and never made half the wave that this movie has.That aside, the premise of the movie in that the couple are both hit-persons, provides for a lot of set pieces and some excellent action. The interplay of a pair of warring hit-people reflects that of a badly married couple very well (not that I would know that!). The script is really strong, and gives some excellent dialogue to the leads. For me the beauty is in the detail here, not the big explosions. When John walks to his tool shed to check if his secret stash of money has been taken he's instantly upset that the tool shed has been rifled, the typical man's domain, except he never ever used it. It's these little moments of pettiness in an angry relationship that made me, and the audience laugh. Those and the superb counsellor scenes, perfect moments.The action is pretty cool in most parts, and the most excellent scene was the car chase. They've really tried to pull the camera back from the action a bit, something I wasn't really enjoying in a lot of Hollywood movies these days, and you get to see things that are actually happening. Plus the script writers haven't stopped at the dialogue, they've brought the sharp inventiveness into the arena of the set pieces as well, and there are a few good laughs to be had while the cars do battle from the action itself as well as the continuing married banter.A couple of things did stand out for me though, there seem to be a few huge cuts which were quite jarring. One is early on when you see for the first time John Smith on a job, and the camera seems to drop and hide behind a chair for most of the events. Then the second big one is when John and Jane go for glory after having a big fight, and just as they seem to be getting to the nitty gritty they suddenly collapse and you are left wondering if Brad just can't go for that long. To be honest that's a nice relief for us mere mortals with sixteen packs instead of six.Yet that's something I noticed throughout, bullets firing and hitting nothing more than walls and inanimate objects, which is fine for the fight scene between the couple, but during the rest of the movie it all seemed a little watered down for me. I'm not saying give me an R or 18 rating, I'm just looking for a little more of the real hit-person feel. There's also something along these lines that happens near the end that makes me think there was another ending but again it was chopped. Perhaps it was, perhaps it was another cut I felt just didn't work right.However, those niggles aside, it's a great evenings entertainment, and an enjoyable film. The script is sharp and insightful, with the wonderful chemistry on screen from Pitt and Jolie, who bring back the beauty of the old Hollywood on screen couplings for me. They have proved themselves in some key scenes in this movie, I'd like to see them take it to something meatier.I now hold a good hope for The Bourne Ultimatum from Doug Liman and for X-Men 3 from the writer Simon Kinberg.",7,0,5,14 June 2005
When Harry Met Sally...," Beautiful film, giving hope to all those seemingly unrequited loves.
","Can you beat some of the lines in this film? As a guy, which I am, I identified with Harry's lines so much, and you can't help but side with him. The chemistry between the two actors, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is superb, and you believe in them when they talk, you feel for them when they look at each other. Even the friends are well casted, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. It's such relaxed acting and filming that you do nothing but watch these people fall in love, and pretty soon you feel like you're involved as well. With a fantastic soundtrack, direction, script and acting, it's a great film.",9,90,98,16 October 2002
War of the Worlds," A great epic, but a bit too much ET and hidden meaning
","I came to this movie with some preconceptions, my image was clouded by two names. Spielbergs tendency to be very off form of late and Cruise who has been bigger than any character he's played, and my fear was that seeing him on screen would bring thoughts of his antics offscreen rather than of the character he's playing.I wasn't prepared for the movie that I saw, and some excellent screen moments from both Cruise and Spielberg. Here they both prove that they are on better than ever form and that when needed to they can deliver the best in Hollywood.Let's start with Cruise. His performance begins like the Cruise we think we know, it's almost as if Spielberg knew that the audience would need to be guided along to this character rather than just dropped in front of him. The first moment I saw him I thought of the actor, the name.Then Spielberg pulls you down to ground level and there he is, grinning his hugely perfect and confident grin, stepping proudly to a big mustang and speeding through the corners parking at his house. Suddenly there's a change, you see him step down the performance, there's still some swagger and confidence, and you can still see the personality Cruise, but as the seconds move on and the characters are introduced, so does the personality Cruise disappear. Until the moment the kids have left the car and you're staring at a defensive, embittered and distant father.Early on he's firing with all cylinders playing the angry father trying to find some way to get to his kids without letting real emotion come through. His kids don't accept him as his father, and the daughter is taking a mothering role while the son is rebelling and lashing out.This protective exterior comes crashing down quite early on in the movie, as the invasion begins its initial stages. The scene that marks the turn most effectively is when her returns to his family and they begin to ask what has happened. From this point onwards I didn't even think of the personality or even the name of Cruise again, he was just a superb actor.Throughout the movie he's called upon to display some really strong moments of emotion, particularly of the paternal kind, and I just can't begin to say how convincing and utterly compelling he is during these scenes. It just goes to show what a truly great actor really can do.The supporting actors are good in the movie, with Dakota Fanning giving an excellent performance as a confused and panicked young child. There's no doubt that she is one of the strongest child actors there is in Hollywood just now, and if she is nurtured well and does not fall for the trappings of Hollywood, she just might become a superb actress. However, her character is called upon to whine, cry, scream, and generally be difficult, and this does get quite grating by the latter half of the movie, although it is fair to say that in such circumstances that's probably how a child would act.I think this is probably the only time I'd say this about Tim Robbins but his character seemed out of place, and didn't seem to serve any other dramatic purpose than to show that the father wanted to protect his children, yet we knew this already. The character appears out of nowhere, waves over two people amongst the masses running from the battle. I just couldn't fathom that and it seemed merely a need to recreate a section of the original story, whereas the film might have carried better either without it, or a much toned down set of scenes.The action sequences and effects are stunning. The the tripods walking around the cities firing their rays; people exploding and being vaporised; cars, buildings and roadways being blasted and thrown across the screen with amazing realism, and the action sequence with the boat crossing, all are just stunningly created on screen. I actually couldn't distinguish CGI from model from fullsize, and in the end from reality. It's superbly created and crafted and shows that Spielberg is most definitely back on form.I found that throughout this telling of War of the Worlds I was thinking of Shymalans Signs again and again. There are many comparisons, and Spielberg is telling the Worlds story from the family viewpoint, yet taking them out of the house.There are flaws in the story, and it's obviously here to serve a more current purpose with all the terrorism links throughout, yet it is done in that huge epic style and a very impressive one at that. Cruise is stunning in this role, more than I've seen him in a long time, and I totally forgot his personality and who he is off screen and was lost in his performance.The best thing throughout this movie that I haven't yet mentioned is the overriding feeling of dread that comes out of the movie. I sat through the film with an unease of what was, or could, happen, despite knowing the entire story. That feeling shows a good movie, it drew you in and took you along for the ride making you as anxious as the characters you were watching. This was utterly compelling on screen, yet, in the end, Spielberg wins.After all this suspense and edge of your seat excitement, we're treated to a typically Spielberg ending, and I have to say that we were surprised beyond words at the twee-ness of it all. To be quite frank it was a complete cop out, designed to give you that nice pat on the head and say 'look, everything will be okay' and I hated it. With the message that was being given out throughout the movie we expected an ending that was based more in reality than the world of E.T..",7,0,1,7 August 2005
The Green Mile," A fantastic movie, and a wonderful tale.
","Great performances from all concerned, and especially from David Morse & Barry Pepper who stand up perfectley well next to Tom Hanks. Michael Clarke Duncan is fabulous and had me weeping, smiling and gripping my seat in anticipation. The story is excellent, if slightly harrowing in places, and you certainly don't notice the length. Fantastic movie making, and one of the few Stephen King stories to actually make it through the film making process well.",8,0,1,12 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An excellent recovery in the series and the only prequel to Star Wars IV: A New Hope
","'Twenty eight years, I worked it out' said the guy next to me as we sat and waiting for the movie to start. For those of us who saw, and loved, the original Star Wars trilogy this has been a long wait, and the journey over the past few years an extremely disappointing one. So when the music began and those famous words appeared, my excitement and expectations could not have been any higher.Firstly, let me pitch where my review is coming from. I did love the original Star Wars, and I thought that Episode I was awful, it should have been just twenty minutes of a real movie, and the excellent baddie of Darth Maul should have been made much more of. Episode II, for me, didn't fair much better, and if you asked me now what I liked, I find it hard to remember much other than the closing scene.The words appeared and the scrolling tomes with the music booming and the camera panned down through the stars...The first twenty to thirty minutes had me really worried. I thought that this was going to turn out to be another Clones, with huge battles and every droid or non-human creature that was encountered spoke with a stupid childlike voice. Excuse me for one moment, if I'm going to build an army of robots, or even just a few to maintain a space ship I'm going to make absolutely sure that they have decent voices that wouldn't cause my troops to shoot them in the face after days of space travel. Anyway, my worries grew, and my expectations fell through to the floor.That soon changed though. The movie picks up pace, brings together the crucial parts of the story that let you see exactly where it's going and set various events in motion to produce some stunningly satisfying moments. All except for one that is, one crucial pay off moment is done so badly and looks so wrong it ruined it for me. There are some exceptionally cheesy moments too, and these tend to be at the points where various strands of the story are brought together and a revelation or pay off moment is about to come.However, for the most part the movie builds the darkness in Anakin slowly, and you are shown the gradual change of him moving from the light to the dark side. You can actually see how hard some of the decisions are that he faces in order to walk his path, and there are decisions, not just one moment of a choice. What you also see is that his decisions are not clear cut, they are hard and torturous, it pains him to travel to the dark path. You also see just how brutal and evil the dark side is, but also that even the Sith believe, in their own ways, that what they are doing is for the good of the Galaxy. You actually have some understandings of their motives and the light and dark are not the polar opposites you may have once thought.The acting range is huge here. Both the Emporer and Anakin are played superbly by Ian McDiarmid and Hayden Christensen, despite the odd cheesy piece of dialogue, whereas Ewan McGregor does feel like he tries too hard to be Alec Guinness and seems stifled and restrained in his more human moments. For me the two baddies are by far the best acted, along with that of Yoda. Despite being funny in his previous fight scene of Episode II, in this movie he really is the flag carrier for the Jedi and his scenes are huge stealers. This time you believe he's the strongest Jedi.I can't go without talking of the battle scenes. They are amazing, the effects and the CGI work is truly stunning, and Lucas and his team have really excelled here. The huge swooping scenes, scale of battles and ships, camera movement through the CGI, etc. it's a wonderful sight to behold, and this time it doesn't overtake the story. Even the Jedi fighting scenes are a huge improvement, there are more, they seem slicker and involve the use of more powers. The fight scenes with General Grevious are superb, only bettered by the final battles of the Jedi masters.Okay so what did I think of the movie? Well, after those twenty eight years it has a lot to live up to. It has to complete the circle and bring the audience who grew up with the originals right back to that point, it also had to cater for those new generations that Lucas had pulled in with his kiddies Episode I and teens Episode II. Most importantly though, he had to get the adults back. For me, he's done it. Yes, there are faults, and there are some key scenes that are destroyed but there are some amazingly strong ones.The scene where Anakin looks out across the city to Padme's palace, and she looks back towards the Jedi temple, is surprisingly strong, and perfectly positioned. The decisions and actions have led to this point and now Anakin faces his toughest choice, and the movie reflects this. It's perfectly timed, it carries the weight of the movie and the tipping point is reached, the decision made. You can feel the tension and the heartache in those moments, and then C3PO walks in. At least he doesn't say anything. It's at moments like this you can see the brilliance in these movies and in Lucas, but now and again something brings it down, although thankfully this really does stop in the latter half of the movie and it just gets darker and darker, and bleaker and bleaker.",8,7,15,13 May 2005
Bruce Almighty," More of the same, as Carrey tries to hold back but fails.
","Interesting premise for a story, and it sounded like it could be fun, although the Jim Carrey starring did worry me, the appearance of Morgan Freeman made me rethink.The problem is that this is Mr Carrey trying to hold back from doing his wild and wacky rubber face stuff. Unfortunately he doesn't, and this leads to some really annoying moments, where you wonder what is going on and why.Like some of the catch phrases, the stupid faces and over emphasised movements, and the scene where the newsreader copies his facial movements, and it goes on, and on, and on.There are a few snigger touching moments, but they are few and far between, and the setups and the eventual plot finish, are so Hollywood formula you want to weep.Give it a miss. Go watch the Truman Show instead.",4,6,14,11 April 2004
Signs," Excellent suspenseful thriller, with an unnerving edge.
","An excellent film from M. Night Shyamalan, once again. He even manages to show us more tricks and twists up his sleeve, although not so pivotal as Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, they are still there to be seen nonetheless.Mel Gibson is excellent in this movie, and you could so have seen Bruce Willis reliving his previous acting roles here. Joaquin Pheonix, whom I've always considered a great actor, shows me just why I thought that in a great supporting role. However, Rory Culkin didn't really hit the mark for me, but that was quickly forgotten.The plot is superb, and although huge in size, Shyamalan has decided to concentrate on a personal side to the story, a small family and how they are affected by strange events. I am going to try hard and say nothing about the story at all, for despite what all will say about there not being spoilers, if someone is telling you something about the film, then it is!I have never heard an audience scream or sigh relief before, not to this degree anyway, and I have not experienced such a feeling of uneasiness and nervousness in a movie for a very long time. By not showing you events, and choosing to concentrate on reactions and noises, you are spooked and on the edge of your seat much more than if you were just shown it.Everything is rounded and tied off perfectly, and there's such a feeling of having experienced a great movie. I find it hard to fault at all, with laughter coming right in the thick of moments of suspense and fear, and not missing a beat of the script, it shows what a great writer and director Shyamalan is. I've said this twice already, and here I go againI can't wait for his next movie!",10,0,3,25 September 2002
X2: X-Men United," Fantastic story with great characters and effects, perhaps the finest comic adaptation to date
","I really liked X-Men, it was one of the few comic adaptations that really made it big, and also made it right. So I was keen to see if X2 had managed to carry the successful conversion to the big screen again. Word of mouth had it that it was good, but I didn't realise just how good.The movie is excellent. Truly as a movie fan there's not much I can find wrong with this film, and as a comic fan there's not much I can find wrong with the adaptation. If I were pressed then Cyclops is perhaps too wooden and Storm not quite angry enough, but these are tiny failings, tiny.The story is very well written and the characters paths pulled together very skillfully. The introduction of Nightcrawler is superbly done, with the first action scene kicking the action and effects into top gear. Alan Cumming plays the character wonderfully, and despite my first thoughts at being such an odd choice, he fills the role perfectly.Each strand of the story that involves each character begins to pull in different directions, but as the story moves along the strands cross and begin to merge, before all of the characters return to fight the one cause, and the one enemy. What is so different for this movie is the fight as truly moved to humans against X-Men, the war is upon them.Acting talent abounds here, with Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and they all manage to lift the performance of even the smallest character. The weakest links are slight blemishes and really require some serious investigation, Cyclops slightly wooden style and the slightly bland performance of Halle Berry who seems to fail to capture the true anger and strength of the Storm character.Let's be honest though, I am nitpicking, and otherwise this is a truly excellent movie, great entertainment and tension throughout. It's also one of the best comic book adaptations, perhaps even the best to date.",9,0,0,20 March 2005
The Sixth Sense," The only category you can fit this film into is excellent.
","This film isn't a horror, or a thriller, or even a do-the-right-thing film. It's all of them, and although you can clearly see the joins, it helps you across them without you really giving them a second thought.I thought this film was fantastic. Bruce Willis proves that he can act without a dirty string vest, and he proves that there's talent in there dying to get out, with this film I think he's got his ticket out of the action hero genre.Osment, the child star, is amazing. When he whispers low you can feel how scared he is, he genuinely looks terrified during the scary section. This child is more believable than a lot of so-called A-list stars.This is another clever film, it manages to avoid stock scare tactics and over the top 'I'm over here' signs in the story, it's a huge surprise, and I loved it.Go see this film, pray you don't catch any spoilers as I did, and go see it. I can only criticise one thing, and that's the borrowing of a scene directly from another film that just happens to be a personal favourite. Won't tell you though, it might spoil things!",8,0,0,14 November 1999
Munich," Harrowing and brutal with superb performances and amazing realism, it's a harsh but excellent movie.
","Controversy around Munich has been apparent from its announcement, and the unusual move by Spielberg to not talk about it or pamper to the Press has raised expectation and the very controversy he has sought to avoid. Then we began to hear that some critics didn't like it, and that the movie was biased towards or against one viewpoint. As usual I approached this movie with an open mind, and my Scottish viewpoint.The first thing to say is that this movie firmly belongs on the Schindler's List side of Spielbergs work and nowhere near the E.T. side. I'm sure you have guessed by now that it is a serious political drama, but by this I mean it is hard, harrowing and at times quite a brutal movie. The journey will bring you downwards, not upwards to a nice fluffy conclusion, and not even leave you with much hope. Its showing in the clear light of day how messed up, manipulative, blinded and cold human beings can be. Be warned, it's a tough movie and not an easy afternoon viewing.One of the amazing things that Spielberg manages to attain in many of his movies is the level of authenticity. Nowhere is this more apparent in this movie with the style of filming, costume and the writing. Blending real footage with reconstructions which look as genuine as actual news footage, keeping costumes as in the period but without resorting to 70's cheese, using actual camera equipment and styles that represent those used at the time, all combine to give a harsh but very real look and feel to the movie.That is one of the big positives of the film. It's extremely realistic and with that comes the tough and often brutal representations of events from history and the book the movie is based on. Nothing is sugar coated here for Hollywood audiences, and no better places is this shown than with the scenes of murder. From explosions to shootings, they are all portrayed openly and as they would be in real life. Fraught with tension, understated, and meeting death face on. If you are looking for an easy ride in this film, or some shock entertainment, then you are sorely mistaken.I felt that this was quite surprising for Spielberg, even though he has tackled tough subjects in the past, this seems to push the representation of the darker side of reality even more. At times viewing the movie becomes almost uncomfortable to watch, but you're drawn to it like watching a reality show, or news footage.Despite the subject matter there are still a few moments of traditional Spielberg creeping in. There's nothing that harms the movie, but they do illicit a groan and hurt the odd scene for me. One such moment is the where the Isreali and Palestinian argue over a radio station, and what brings them together is the compromise over American music.This probably meant nothing when filming it, and the track was chosen because it was universally know and recognisable, and I really do hate looking for connections in other peoples work when there need not be. Yet it does certainly feel as if there is something being made of this moment, but it's twee and seemingly contrived. Thankfully, there are few moments like this, and you are returned to reality with a bang.I have to say that I feel no bias in this film at all. Spielberg shows that all sides have their level of bloody mindedness and futility from Isreali to Palestinian, even the CIA and the KGB are shown as lost in their own types of hatred, self deception and self fulfilling agendas.The acting is of the highest quality from all of the leads. Bana redeems his pitiful Hulk performance, and Craig shows us what a fine actor he is although definitely not a master of accents - this performance bodes well for Bond. Hinds provides another excellent performance which at times is quite chilling.All these actors give top notch performances being strong, striking and intense. Craig, to some degree, but mainly Bana give the most emotionally charged and altogether confused performances which seem very human and with identifiable pain. Bana's slow change during the latter stages of the movie is particularly worth mentioning.Hinds though, shouldn't be crowded out by these other actors. He brings perhaps the most grounded and real performance, and the moment of recognition of this actor when he first appeared on screen was a joy. I've seen him before and was struck by his performance, and this hits home again in Munich. His connection with Avner seems heartfelt, and his through the movie I was captivated by his character.The movie does a great job of highlighting the futility of the ongoing and escalating acts of revenge, and how these slowly eat away at those involved, destroying who they once were. I say that thinking of all sides involved through the movie and not looking to either Isreali or Palestinian alone.My understanding of the final events of the actual hostage taking in Munich does lay some blame on the handling of the attack on the terrorists. Yet there is no hint of this anywhere, and if I were to point any finger at this movie suggesting it was showing something or some group in an improper or inaccurate light it would be that very operation. It does not appear in the movie and indeed it portrays them as innocent victims.However, this would have surely detracted from the belief of blame in the movie, and after all as Spielberg says, this is not a documentary it's a movie based on real events.As I've said, this movie is tough, harsh and very realistic, resulting in a sometimes brutal portrayal of events. It's not easy watching by any means, but it is a very excellent and moving film.",9,0,1,1 February 2006
The Matrix," Stunning special effects, and surprisingly, plot laden story
","A modern masterpiece, to coin a well overused phrase, but not out of place with this movie.This film has one of those unique qualities that so few films have, it makes you leave the cinema with a feeling of sheer excitement, you feel ready to take on anything and you could, if only the Matrix were real!With amazing special effects, created months prior to scenes being shot, and looking extremely stylish, it delivers everything that you'd expect, and more, an interesting plot. Yes, there is a plot, and although it's way out there, I couldn't help but overlook the far fetched ideas and leap headlong into the Matrix. It challenges all our beliefs about our way of life, and by the end of the film you can almost argue yourself into thinking it could all be true!Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are fantastic, whereas Keanu Reeves is just his usual bewildered character - although in this film it works perfectly. Hugo Weaving, as Agent Smith, is superb, a fantastic love-to-hate character. The way he and Fishburne talk and act throughout this film is just pure cool - I found myself imitating them continuously afterwards.Go see this film, or rent it on DVD. Only word of advice though is make sure you watch it with Digital soundtrack and surround speakers - it'll blow you away.",10,0,0,10 December 1999
Cube," Interesting concept, although characterisation is shallow and rushed.
","I had been told great things about this movie, and things started well. It was claustrophobic and tense, with confusion and suspicion rife among the characters, a few fantastically fiendish deaths, and there it stopped for me.The characters were extremely stereotypical, and they were revealed all too quickly it seemed rushed. There wasn't any feeling of any kind for the characters, good or bad, and no empathy means that the key plot points are lost as this film is all about the characters and their interactions.With a more carefully selected set of characters, this could really have been a great film. As it is, it's good, but you feel it's missing it's point.",6,0,1,11 April 2004
Fantastic Four," Fun entertainment with no great meat. Enjoyable, funny, with Chiklis, Evans and McMahon great to watch.
","All the production news, pre-release rumour and reviews were all pointing towards this being a bad movie. I was waiting for and expecting it, but as someone who has grown up reading comics, these years are the ones we are looking forward to. Our comic heroes are coming to the big screen and they are coming in droves, and not in eighties low budget style, but in big screen and with big budgets.Basically I couldn't miss this, I couldn't dare, despite what people said about it. Yet I still feared the worst.The early news that the latter portions of the movie were entirely re-written and re-cut during the editing process without the actors was worrying, and then seeing the reviews and the hefty defence of the movie by the Studio and actors was worrying.Something you have to think about with the characters in Fantastic Four is that they aren't like characters like Batman. Batman is hard edged, real, gritty, violent. Where the line between good and bad is bigger than the black and white put together, and that's where the Batman character lives.Fantastic Four is a lighter base of characters and stories, like Spiderman and such. There are clearer sides to be drawn on good and bad, and the characters stay there. The world is more fantasy than real, and with that I went to see the Fantastic Four.It starts off really fast, and keeps going like that. You really do notice that the story goes along faster than most other movies. Development of the characters before anything happens to them is out the window and before your seat is warm the team are in space and being hit by a storm.Now this isn't really a bad thing because firstly the pace of the movie seems pretty even, there's no point you're wishing it would either hurry up or slow down, it seems quite well paced throughout. Secondly, the character development isn't really forgotten, it's bundled in with the rest of the story, and this makes for a refreshing change. After all the story is about the Fantastic Four and Dr Doom, so let's see them.Character development is pretty loose on Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman (I can't use the word girl when referring to Jessica Alba) and Von Doom. What you get is the bare minimum to set them up for the second film. The characters that we see a bit more of are Thing and Torch, and this is also good for they are at loggerheads from the beginning of the movie and are two entirely different characters.Thing is a family man, gentle and caring, and very thoughtful of others. Torch is a wild young guy who likes extreme sports and thinks only of himself. They're shown quite well, and the cheese factor seen in some of the trailers is not so apparent when you see the movie itself.For me the characters of Doom, Torch and Thing stand out the most. Doom is played by Julian McMahon very well, he's evil and self centred, making him an excellent choice for the new Hitcher role. His slow move to internal destruction and total acceptance of evil is well done, and his little nuances are good fun to watch.Chris Evans has some superb lines to deliver and delivers them with spot on timing. He's funny, and the comedy works. Michael Chiklis looks very at home in this role, although I kept thinking of Vic at certain points in the movie he did manage to shake the bad image quite well. He shows his trouble with accepting who he has become even through that huge suit, and you just can't help but like the character.The film really is a setup for the following movies, and there's nothing wrong with that, but you have to remember what this is. It's not gritty, meaty, thoughtful material. This is fun entertainment. Sit back and enjoy a comic ride, and it does work. I left having been entertained, and although I quickly moved on to think of other things, I still enjoyed it. Just because it is a comic adaptation, do not judge it with the same eye as Batman.Action is what makes the most of this movie. The set pieces are well conceived and orchestrated, particularly the early bridge piece that introduces the world to the characters.I'm not going to slate this movie, it's not fantastic, but it is good entertainment and opens the way for a strong series. The characters are good, with Torch, Doom and Thing stealing the show, and the action is strong as well. It's worth a watch if you don't fancy something to make you think too much, but do want to come away feeling you enjoyed yourself. Just remember two things, it's light, and it's entertainment. It's a popcorn movie.",7,1,3,24 July 2005
Sin City," There are some great moments, and superb performances, perhaps just too much style over substance.
","I'd never read any of the graphic novels on which this movie has been based, and I didn't even know anything about the story before hearing about the production, and right from the first trailer it had me. The names, the style, it all looked superb, so I was excited to finally see it at the cinema.As soon as it opened I was impressed. The visuals and style were superb, and Bruce Willis seemed to be acting his socks off for this role, he suited it so well. However with the good bits came the opening poor performance from Michael Madsen, he hit the audience with a handful of cheese and struggled lines.It could have been intentional, and the attempt at that old Film Noir style had either resulted in some cheesy performances from those that couldn't produce it effectively, or perhaps it was unintentional. This is something that ran through a couple of the main characters for me. Clive Owen and Madsen were the main problems, in Owen I felt like I was watching Horatio Nelson in an episode of CSI: Miami, say cheesy line and turn off camera while posing, wait for fade.I was also surprised by Benecio Del Toro, he was passable, but he just didn't hit the mark with his usual performance. Those who without a doubt did steal the show were Willis, Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke.Rourke, like Willis, provided a wonderful performance and fitted so well into this genre.They both really portrayed the gritty, hard and embittered characters perfectly and very believably. Those sections of the movie were by far the better and more enjoyable than the others. Wood was a different matter, I've heard many people say he was really good, and he is, he's really effective and creepy, yet how much of that is acting and how much is the style giving that impression? Let's not forget that he ran, jumped and stared, oh and climbed down a stairway.Something that distracted me from the movie and pulled me out a few times were the connections made between the stories themselves. Some had connections, and others didn't, and whenever I saw one I found myself trying to resolve them and make some form of conclusion from it. Unfortunately there was none, it was just to give some time and location reference, and to be honest neither was needed. For me though, I did find I was pulled out of the story each time, and struggled to think of them as nothing.The movie is violent, but gets away with a lot because of the style and lack of colour at key moments, and it's this style that makes for a huge portion of what the movie is. It leads me to the question of how successful the follow-up will be, and now that the style is no longer a gimmick, if it will continue to work as a driving factor for the movie. This is something that the Matrix encountered during it's series, and it seriously flagged on the second movie.There are some great moments, and superb performances from Rourke and Willis. The style that has been captured on screen is nothing short of stunning and quite unique, this has definitely been a huge accomplishment in the adaptation of comics to screen - whoever ends up making The Watchmen please take note - as they've been ever so faithful to the original material. However some truly bad acting and a slightly disjointed feel clouded the movie for me, and it really is the style and the two excellent actors that has kept the score so high.",8,1,3,1 July 2005
True Romance," Strong, stylish and extremely fun. Unusually you'll feel for the leads.
","Good performances all round on this film, but particular credit goes, as always, to Christopher Walken who shines as the gangster. Gary Oldman's character is by far the strangest of his career. A very funny but dark tale with some quiet tough and violent scenes. Not at all what I expected, a genuine start to a story that just seems to keep 'upping the ante' until everything is out of the main characters control. Slow tension build up throughout, and you'll suddenly find yourself really caring about the leads without thinking.",8,0,1,12 August 2001
High Fidelity," Confused? Commitment problems? Watch this film!
","Personally, I think Cusack is one of the great actors, you always know it's him, there's no disguising that, but you believe everything he says and everything he does, and once again, he does it extremely well. It's easy to identify with this character, or I thought it was. Never having read the Hornby book I found the film very insightful, at times funny and, if you have your girlfriend sitting next to you, sometimes scary. A definite feel good movie, but we all need that, and this delivers but without being too corny or cheesey. A very good film that asks you questions that you've always asked yourself anyway, if you're a guy that is. Yet don't be scared by that statement, it's still a highly entertaining film, with very funny performances from all the record shop staff.",9,0,1,18 November 2000
The Island," A very poorly executed idea with problems throughout the movie, and a very poor DVD offering
","The Island, supplied by LOVEFiLM DVD Rental, was nominated on The Movie Blog Readers Awards 2005 in the category of Worst Execution of the Best Plot, and for good reason too. The film may sound like a superb concept, but the realisation is pitifully poor and this DVD does nothing to help it along, neither do the ample talents of Ewan McGregor or Scarlett Johansson.Movie: The film starts of really strongly, and promises much from its well crafted plot. The style is slightly removed from Michael Bay's typical blockbuster as we are treated to slower progression of characters and the questioning of McGregor as Lincoln Six-Echo against his reality. Then, typically, things turn into a big Bay action fest with formulaic plot changes that you can see a mile off. Let me say that I have nothing against those movies because I actually really like The Rock and Armageddon, they're great fun. Yet when you have such a great futuristic plot filled with excellent possibilities, turning it into standard action fare seems quite a sad and easy path to take. You see half way through the movie it turns into set pieces which are badly thought through and harshly edited. For instance, take the highway scene where Echo pushes train wheels off the back of a flatbed truck. Those would be train wheels for the magnetic trains that run without wheels that we saw a few times at the beginning of the movie or the fast car used in a high speed chase later in the movie is racing along one second and then the immediate scene after which is tracking the car shows the door wide open, raised in the air, as these doors do. What just happened there? Then there's the jet bike sequence, and we seen these bikes for well on half their screen time before you can actually see that there's a second person on the bike, mounted at the rear. Typically the close cropped camera work, far too fast cuts, and harsh editing make these action sequences difficult to follow. Sure it's not as bad as some of the Bourne sequences, but this is tough to follow in places. There's similar issues all the way through that make you think there have either been some serious continuity errors, someone hasn't been thinking of the universe in which the movie is set and checking all the story changes, there's been some harsh editing, or indeed all of the above. There are some saving graces though, and I'm not talking McGregor's American accent, although the moment when he confronts his real self and he has a Scottish accent which he mimics is very amusing. No, Johannson fares very well here, as does Djimon Hounsou, let's just say they do the best with what they have. I mean how can you deal with lines such as 'I like it with your tongue' in the middle of a romantic kissing scene? I get that they haven't kissed before, but it sounds corny as hell and comic. Picture: 2.35:1 Anamorphic: The picture was sharp, although the colours were slightly drained and the contrast harsh throughout. Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1: A good audio track, some great LFE during the action sequences, but a DTS on such an action film could have been better, that and some subtlety! Extras: TV Making of Featurette, DVD-ROM Extras: I actually just thought that there was a single featurette on here which was extremely poor, so after a quick look I sent it back. However I'm now led to believe that there is a full audio commentary from Michael Bay hidden away on the PC DVD-Rom section. Well I never saw it and it's not because I didn't try. I put the DVD into my PC and it attempted a straight install of its own player. Since I already have my own free player I cancelled it and attempted to access anything new on the disc - nothing was visible. Nowhere did I see the mention of the audio commentary now being enabled, perhaps I missed it, but if you're going to offer it only on the PC side don't force an install of your own software and make the features plainly visible. Overall: A very poor movie with a botched up DVD offering. Hidden audio commentary, forcing install of it's own DVD software, is just not on. Poorly put together and a not very enjoyable movie at all.",3,1,2,5 February 2006
