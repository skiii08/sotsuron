Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Story drags it down
","It's definitely the more story-oriented of the two, and that might hurt it. Since volume one is all action, all of the plot and character development is left to this part, which makes it a bit too long and talky. That's not to say the dialogue isn't good, because it is, but parts of this film - especially near the end - drag on a lot longer than they need to. The climax takes forever, and then it is somewhat anti-climatic, though the final act of revenge was fitting. The action is sparse but awesome, and the acting is significantly better - probably because David Carradine's actually in this one - but it is slightly worse than the first volume. Although, Pai Mei is my favourite character in the set, so I have to give it props for that.",8,1,2,26 March 2007
Vertigo," Not Hitchcock's best
","I wasn't really overly impressed. It's classic Hitchcock direction, of course, but the plot tries to cover too many stories and it just becomes tiresome after a while. First there's the mystery surrounding Madeleine's 'possession', then the love story between her and Scotty, then the mystery surrounding her death, and then the love story between Scotty and Judy, and then - finally - the completion of the mystery. Too much flip-flopping between the various mysteries and love stories. I also thought that Scotty's vertigo should have been more incorporated into the film - it shows up once at the beginning, once in the middle, once at the end, and that's it. Still, Stewart is great and Novak is gorgeous and fantastic in her dualish role, and it's fantastically directed, of course. I would have loved it if it had followed the promise shown in the opening scene, but alas, only the trippy dream sequence and the stuff in the bell tower does so. Still a pretty good film, though.",8,1,5,30 June 2007
Alien 3," Great beginning, terrible end
","It starts off really well, with some great suspense built up, but it soon degenerates into a mindless action flick with some really bad effects. I don't know what happened between Aliens and this, but somehow the visual effects managed to get worse. Every scene of the alien running down the hallway looks terrible fake; somehow, though, the close-ups of the Alien look fine. I'd say this is the darkest of the Alien films - it's quite grim and much more like the first than the second. The first hour is quite good, the last hour is not. Everything just degenerates, from the story to the acting to the direction. I don't know what happened. The ending, while well-intentioned, is terribly executed. That said, it's not a terrible film, as the great beginning redeems it.",6,1,2,18 April 2007
Mission: Impossible III," Solid summer entertainment
","An amazing action film that never lets up and almost never slows down. Though there are a few domestic scenes of Ethan's homelife, they feel completely out of place, and are easily overshadowed by the non-stop action. The frenetic pace leaves little room for the audience to breath, but this is what a summer blockbuster is all about. The story is basically a mix of the first two films, with gaping plot holes and great leaps of logic, but it is of secondary concern. A movie like this is so much fun and so entertaining that I took little notice of the flaws in the plot - it's just a means to string the action set pieces together. Not that there's anything wrong with that...What made this much better than the terrible second one was the return of the IMF team. Instead of Ethan doing mostly everything himself, he's got a team backing him up, harking back to the best parts of the original. Indeed, the best scene in this movie is the Vatican kidnapping. Very well staged and shot, never slowing down but never getting out of control. A close second for best scene would have to be the bridge attack - the best pure action set piece in some time. A complete overload on the senses, but it works very well. The final confrontation is somewhat of a letdown compared to the rest of the movie, but it's obvious that they were going for more of an emotional scene than a action-packed one. If the homelife angle had been built up better, it would have worked, but it ends up feeling a bit flat. It's still incredibly thrilling at times, but never overtly powerful or emotional.While the story is completely implausible and full of so many holes that I could easily pick it apart here, I won't - as I said, that's not the centerpiece of the movie. For this type of movie, the story worked well, and wasn't too complicated or silly. The acting was decent, with Hoffman doing his best in a one-note villain role, despite not nearly enough screen time. Abrams' directing is great during the action scenes, but nothing special the rest of the time. As this movie is almost all action, he does a very good job in his debut. The visual effects are solid if not outstanding, while the stunts are insane - they manage to maintain realism somewhat while being incredibly exciting. The classic M:i score is a bit underused but still effective. A very solid production.I would rank this one far above the terrible second installment, but still below the masterpiece of the first one. While it has by far the best action of the trilogy, the story could've used a lot of work, just to make the film more well-rounded. But it isn't so bad that it ruins the film; just prevents it from being great. As it stands, this is solid summer entertainment.",7,0,1,8 July 2006
3:10 to Yuma," An exhilarating ride elevated by its characters
","I quite loved it. Westerns are the one genre that I always seem to enjoy but are rarely made, and this was a fantastic, old-school, kick-ass genre flick. Not only does it have some exhilarating action scenes and some good 'ol shootouts, but it's got a great story with ample amounts of depth, solid characters, and a terrific ending. Crowe and Bale play off each other perfectly, with the former's charisma and wit contrasting excellently with the latter's subtlety and stoicism. And the finale, while eschewing logic and reason for an adrenaline rush, makes perfect thematic and even narrative sense. It's not overtly stylistic or artistic, but it is a fantastic thrill ride of a movie that's a near-masterpiece of the genre.",7,1,3,6 January 2008
Spartacus," Refreshingly dark epic
","The presence of two directors is quite noticeable, as is the lack of Kubrickian influence on the script, as it's almost like a tale of two movies. There's the dark, depressing, realistic Kubrick stuff (the scene right before the first fight to the death, where the gladiators hear the nobles discussing trivial matters, is right out of Paths of Glory), and then there's the sappy, melodramatic, happy Hollywood stuff (those terrible montages of life in the slave camp). Luckily Kubrick wins out (for the most part) and the end is suitably dismal.As with Paths of Glory, there's a lot of ideas thrown about dealing with the distinction between the higher and lower classes, and that couldn't be more obvious than with the political maneuvering of Crassus and Gracchus nearly outweighing the noble plight of Spartacus. Kubrick also likes three-way conflicts (Jack/Danny/the Overlook in The Shining, US/Russia/Ripper in Dr. Strangelove) and Spartacus and Gracchus uniting (in a way) to beat their common enemy is symptomatic of that. That stuff, along with that horribly depressing end with all the slaves crucified along the road, is vintage Kubrick.Unfortunately there's all that cheesy Hollywood stuff about hope and glory and freedom that really feels at odds with the realistic epic that the rest of the film is trying to put forth. The ill-fated romance, Spartacus' many speeches, indeed the entire epic battle all fall in line with this. Of course, we also get that great 'I'm Spartacus!' scene, so maybe it's not all bad.The sexual innuendo and political drama which lie just under the surface are quite refreshing, and really distinguish this film from, say, Ben-Hur. It seems to me to be an epic more concerned with art than financial success, at least for the most part, and I really dug that. It's not perfect, but it's not mediocre like so many epics of the time, either.Definite recommend, especially for Ben-Hur fans so they can learn what life is really like.",8,2,5,22 April 2008
United 93," Emotionally powerful, but not necessarily great
","A very emotionally powerful finale does not make this a perfect movie, or even a great one, though it is an important one. For the most part, it felt more like a documentary than a fictional, creatively crafted film, which works, I guess, but made it confusing and even boring at times. The beginning hour or so, which focused mostly on the air traffic controllers, FAA, and military, was the prime culprit of this, and I felt like a was watching a doc much more than a film. The scenes which focus on the flight itself are by far the strongest, because it feels very real, raw, and moving. The shaky cam works best here, because it feels like you're part of the action, rather than watching it. Unfortunately, not enough time is spent developing the story on the flight, and it feels shortchanged by the end of it. The mix of unknown actors and people playing themselves makes it very realistic, though not necessarily better. The ending is very emotional, perhaps the most of any film I've seen, but it doesn't make the entire film better - just the ending. Overall, a good film that is very realistic, but also overrated.",6,1,3,13 September 2006
Chinatown," One of the greatest noirs
","I recently watched this for the first time in a while, and I was blown away by it. I don't think I ever realized how terrific it is. In fact, I'd place it behind only L.A. Confidential as far as pure film-noirs go. The story is typical of the genre, but the way that it is homaging the classic films of its type as well (from little stuff like the comment about the Venetian blinds to the casting of John Huston) is ingenious. And the way that they weave real history into it as well makes the story that much more intriguing. The mystery is layered and involving and realistic, and the dialogue is fresh and witty without seeming too stylized. It's impeccably directed and there are great performances from everyone involved, plus there's another great Goldsmith score to back everything up. Simply one of the greatest noirs ever put on screen.",10,2,4,10 December 2007
Unbreakable," A masterpiece
","I'm rewatching all of Shyamalan's films in order, and this one really stood out and held up well. I've always liked it, but watching it now, it just seemed so much better. The story is simply superb, perhaps slow moving but definitely not boring, and the twist, while not as shocking as Sixth Sense, is perfect for the story. Definitely an original concept that is executed perfectly. The acting, too, is superb, with Willis impressing with his subtle, layered performance and Jackson excelling as a crazed villain that's not over-the-top but as realistic as the film's setting. Shyamalan's direction is simply outstanding, his use of themes and motifs is like no other modern director, and it's only heightened by the fantastic cinematography. The score is one of my personal favourites of all-time, it works perfectly in the film and makes the scene in the train station - the highlight of the film - that much better. One of my all-time favourite films now.",10,1,2,7 March 2007
Citizen Kane," Very overrated
","Supremely overrated. Technically brilliant, with its use of extremely low camera angles and chiaroscuro lighting. A great performance by Welles drives the piece. But that's about all it's got. The story is far from compelling and I never felt involved in the character's tale. The use of flashbacks doesn't paint a very interesting or complete picture of Kane, as there is far too much devoted to overlong anecdotes and not enough to the overall story. The Rosebud twist is a nice way to end the film, but I can't judge how surprising or shocking it was, as I had been spoiled long ago. Oh, and way too long, even at only two hours. It just drags on and on. I can see why it's a technical masterpiece, but other that that, it's nothing special.",9,4,9,24 October 2006
Underworld," Stylish, Gothic action thriller with depth
","I'm a sucker for stylish action thrillers and Gothic horror flicks, and I love vampire and werewolf movies when done right, so I'm pretty much inclined to love this film based on concept alone. Luckily the execution nearly lives up to the hype. There are some plausibility issues (despite the fantastical setting), and the story, while intriguing, isn't explored well enough, but the film is so interesting and entertaining that it doesn't really matter. A perfect example of style over substance, though the substance isn't completely missing.The story in itself is quite interesting, even if the plot is a bit disappointing. The original pitch, 'Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves', isn't that accurate, and it would have been a bit better had it been. Instead of a vampire falling in love with a werewolf, she falls in love with a human who becomes a werewolf (and then, later, a hybrid, which kinda ruins it). A slight difference, but a noticeable one. The overall setting - an ongoing war between the two species - is very cool and quite original, and is made even more effective by the fact that the film begins right in the thick of it, without much exposition. The history is explored later (not nearly deeply enough, though - that's left for the sequel), which makes it much more interesting. A deeply ingrained mythology accompanies all the stylish action, making it more than just a B-grade action flick.One of the main highlights is the entire style and tone of the film - it's always night, and it's always raining. Very dark and creepy, just adding to the horror element. In between all the gunfights, there are scenes set in a vampire manor or a werewolf den, which helps ground the film with some sort of realism. The special effects are fantastic, despite being on a pretty small budget, as the werewolf transformations - and, indeed, the beasts themselves - are nearly flawless. And the acting is as good as you can expect from an action/horror/thriller, with Beckinsale, Michael Sheen as Lucian, and Bill Nighy as Viktor all standing out. Overall, a very cool movie with an intriguing storyline and fantastic style.",7,0,0,20 August 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Exhilarating, well-made, and very cool
","Quite entertaining, very well-made, and just plain cool. Though much more action than horror, and perhaps containing too much zombie killing and not enough social commentary, but this is mere nitpicking. The beginning is simply brilliant, from the opening attack scene to the driving scene, which is so well shot and just chilling in its depiction of the apocalypse. Not to mention the wicked credits, incorporating a Johnny Cash song into some memorable stock footage. The first 90 minutes or so of the film contains little action, but it serves the film well, as it would feel overdone. Case in point, the last twenty minutes are chocked full of such non-stop thrills that it's in dire need of a breath, but never gets one. The ending is just perfect, though, as it's just as uncompromising as the rest of the film. The acting is about as good as one can expect, and the direction is just awesome. All in all, a solid remake and an exhilarating film.",9,0,1,1 September 2006
Alien: Resurrection," All-around terrible
","The really dark sense of humour that the film attempts works for me for about fifteen minutes. After that, it just gets really, really bad. The film looks nice, but that's about all it's got going for it. Sigourney Weaver is a real badass for about half the film, but then she melts and becomes really boring. Winona Ryder - wow, talk about a terrible performance. Far too much attitude in her android. The script is pretty bad; the terrible acting combined with cheesy dialogue makes it sound even worse. Not to mention the story is just lame. The 'love scene' was one of the funniest scenes I've ever watched. The visuals are a marked improvement over the other films, but it's to no avail. The underwater scene is kinda cool, but ruined by the acting; the scene with the hybrid getting sucked out of a tiny hole in the window is incredibly gory, but, again, ruined by Weaver's crying face. Just a terrible attempt at an Alien black comedy.",5,0,1,18 April 2007
12 Monkeys," Up there with the best of science fiction
","One of the all-time great science fiction works, as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but he's outdone by Pitt's incredibly frenetic turn that's unlike anything he's done before or since. Even Stowe isn't out of her league here, though. The story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about. The climactic scene is beautifully magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Lots of dark humour on display here. Fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.",10,0,0,30 April 2007
Shaun of the Dead," Comedic brilliance
","Utterly brilliant horror/comedy with one of the smartest screenplays in recent memory and some great visuals. Every scene in the film is either a reference to another horror film or a foreshadowing of what to come, and it works perfectly. The humour is very dry but very sharp, making it very unlike a film like Anchorman while remaining just as funny as that. The direction and editing are surprisingly fresh for a comedy, and the gore effects are great fun. Add to that some terrific acting, especially by Nick Frost as the big comedic lug and Bill Nighy as the evil stepdad, great use of music - 'Don't Stop Me Now', anyone? - and some great dialogue, and this is one of my favourite comedies ever and certainly one of the funniest films of the new millennium.",10,0,3,18 March 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Disappointing sequel
","Unfortunately, this is nowhere near the brilliance of the first film. Displaying little of the original's charm or wit, it attempts to blow the viewer away by having outlandish action scenes and slapstick comedy that is neither charming nor witty. I felt little to no connection to the characters - even Jack Sparrow himself - and was not even wowed by some of the big action scenes. That's not to say that this is a bad movie; it's just not nearly as good as the first one.The plot is fairly complicated, with far too many sub-plots. Regrettably, the writers attempted to bring all the characters back and fit them into the story, which leads to some unneeded scenes and extraneous story lines. The first act of the movie - with the tribal natives - is completely unnecessary and could have easily been cut to shave half an hour or so off the running time - something that is sorely needed. Although this is only a few minutes longer than the first, it feels a lot longer - perhaps because the action gets to be a bit too much. The film is trying so hard to be fun that it feels far too forced, and the big action scenes just become monotonous. I actually felt kinda bored at parts, something I never experienced during the first film.The acting is somewhat decent, with Depp giving another great performance, though admittedly not one as good as the first one. Bloom is the same, Knightley is actually worse, but Nighy as the villain and Skarsgård as Bootstrap are both great. The comedy is much less effective this time around, as there are far fewer funny lines, and it seems the writers had to resort to crude slapstick to bring about more laughs. The fight scenes seem to drag on for too long, though they are well-staged. There's none of the great meld of comedy and action that made the first so memorable - here, it's all very wooden and rigid, nothing feels natural. It's a bit painful to watch at times, actually.That's not to say that everything about the film is bad. The film's darker scenes are brilliant - everything involving Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman is quite cool to watch, and I would have liked to see more. The voodoo witch scene is interesting, especially the final scene with the return of our favourite villain - a very dramatic entrance. The special effects are quite amazing, especially with Jones' sea creature crew and, of course, the Kraken. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments - less than the original, admittedly, but it's still entertaining. And the entire look of the film is very well done - production design is top notch. The technical quality of the film is outstanding.It's too bad that this film was so disappointing - it had so much potential, and it squanders it by trying too hard to capture the first film. Unneeded scenes, repetitive action scenes, and forced comedy make this much less entertaining than the first one. I'll probably see it one more time to let it sink in, but for now, it's a definite disappointment.",5,3,12,6 July 2006
12 Angry Men," Gripping and powerful
","Simply astounding. It's incredible that basically just a one-scene movie could be so gripping and involving, but the fantastic script and terrific acting make it so. I'm glad they didn't show a re-enactment of the crime, or definitively say whether the kid was innocent or not, as the film's not really about the crime at all. It could be the best character study ever told, even though we know none of the character's names until the end (and then only two of them) nor what they're like outside of the jury room. The only weak spot I found among the ensemble was Juror #2, I just found him incredibly irritating and was surprised the other jurors - especially #3 - didn't rage at him at all. It's kinda idealistic, but still one of the greatest films ever.",9,1,2,30 June 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Bland and mediocre attempt at an epic
","Fairly bland and sanitized attempt at an epic, which has some beautiful landscapes and interesting characters, but not much else. Some pretty terrible performances from the kid actors, and some truly crappy CGI for the various woodland creatures. Some scenes are kinda cool, but, for the most part, they're far too childish and boring. I mean, Santa Claus giving them weapons? You've gotta be kidding me. And the final battle scene is so poorly executed that's it's barely exciting or even interesting. Still, the production design is top-notch, and it never feels boring or overtly preachy (though I could clearly make out the thinly veiled Christian symbolism). Overall, simply mediocre.",2,1,2,24 October 2006
Spider-Man 2," An improvement over the original
","Much more mature than the first one, leading to a more interesting story and a better film overall. The drama surrounding Spider-Man is more fleshed out in this one, and the problems are more believable. Instead of just a cartoony action film, like the first one, this is a comic book film with a more compelling story and realistic characters, not to mention better action and a superior villain - though one not seen nearly enough. Some of the romance still needs work, though, and there are long stretches where nothing happens, scenes that would have been better served by including the villain and advancing the main plot. Still, this is an improvement over the first film, and a great movie.Though the main plot of the movie involves Spider-Man calling it quits, there are far too many scenes where he listens to long speeches from various characters swaying him one way or another. Although at least one of those is useful, and the dialogue is better written than in the original, far too much time is spent on scenes like this. Unfortunately, it only takes time away from the villain, Doc Ock, who is much more intriguing and better realized than the Green Goblin from the first film. There are also far too many scenes between Peter and MJ, and since they all seem to dissolve into 'I love you, I love you not', some of then could have been easily done away with. Indeed, what the film is most lacking in is action, which is too bad, because it's fantastic when it shows up. Though the special effects still need some work, it's a vast improvement, and the action is both exhilarating and central to the plot.Another improvement over the first film would be in the acting department. Tobey Maguire managed to lose some of his goofiness, although it still pops up periodically, and he's more than able in serious dramatic scenes; Kirsten Dunst is still not a good actress, but she's better, and can at least attempt some serious scenes; James Franco gives pretty much a one-note performance, as an angry, brooding villain-to-be; and J.K. Simmons is as hilarious as he was the first time around. But the real stand out this time around is Alfred Molina as Doc Ock - not over-the-top like Willem Dafoe in the first one, but simultaneously evil and pitiable. The only thing disappointing about his performance is that there isn't more of it - one of the main problems with the movie. The mechanical arms are perfectly realized, and the fight scenes between him and Spidey are spectacular. His character is so interesting that it is fitting, then, when he ultimately redeems himself and saves the day, instead of Spidey.Overall, an improvement over the first film, but still not a perfect film. It is still one of the top comic book films, but it spends far too much time on a poorly told romance and not enough on a intriguing villain. Still, the story is interesting, the action is fantastic, and the characters are believable. A nice lead in to the final (?) chapter in the trilogy.",8,0,0,22 August 2006
Batman Returns," The best of the original franchise
","An improvement over the original, mainly because Burton let his distinctive style come out. The story's a bit better, but it's the Gothic look of the film that makes me like it more. And also because Catwoman is probably the best Batman villain portrayed thus far. The romance in this film is far more interesting than in any of the other Batman films - especially Begins - and it's mostly because Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Keaton is better than in the first one, and Danny DeVito is pretty good, but I thought Christopher Walken was wasted in a rather useless villain role. It's easily the weirdest of all the Batman films, and it's also the best of the 'original' franchise.",8,0,0,25 June 2007
Superbad," Hilarious and heartfelt
","As hilarious as I was expecting, but also surprisingly genuine and heartfelt. The relationship between the two leads is absolutely spot on and perfectly blends comedy and drama. This emotional core elevates the film above most other teen comedies and puts it right alongside American Graffiti, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Dazed & Confused. And it's also (probably) the funniest film of the year thus far. Everything from physical slapstick to witty one-liners are utilized and it all works fantastic. The subplot with McLovin and the cops takes away a bit from the central story, but it's so hilarious that it doesn't really matter. The film does run a bit long, and some of the middle should have be trimmed, but, overall, this is still a modern teen comedy classic.",8,11,24,9 September 2007
Hot Fuzz," Hits the mark much more than it misses
","Despite how much I loved Shaun of the Dead, I had my reservations about seeing the follow-up collaboration, Hot Fuzz. Perhaps it was due to my pure indifference toward high-octane, shoot-em-up action flicks, or perhaps it was just because I couldn't believe that anything could match the brilliance of Shaun. The trailer seemed to confirmed my fears, as it was considerably less funny than I would have hoped for, but once the glowing reviews started rolling in, I was a bit relieved. All of them seemed to say the same thing: it was not as good as Shaun. So, with mild trepidation, I went out and saw Hot Fuzz to judge for myself.And the result is: I agree. It is not as good as Shaun of the Dead, though that may be for a couple of reasons: I was expecting it not to be, Shaun took me a few viewings to fully appreciate its brilliance, or perhaps its just my lack of outright love for action flicks. Whatever the case, I still found it to pale in comparison to the brilliant zom-rom-com (or is it rom-zom-com?). Do not take this as a sign that the film is bad; quite to the contrary, it's one of the funniest films I've seen. It just was missing something. All of the ingredients were there: same director, same writers, same leading duo, same style of humour. So what went wrong? I suspect that it tripped over its plot. The story of Shaun was simple: it merely re-told the tale of every other zombie movie from the past 40 years; a relatively easy plot to follow. It just added its own spice to it. The problem with Hot Fuzz is that it gets too caught up in trying to tell its story that it forgets to make the audience laugh. As the mystery is solved about 2/3 of the way through  complete with a scene that made me remember The Da Vinci Code, whether intentional or not  the tone sharply turns from light to dark. The characters have been developed so well that it seems like almost a cheat to the audience to treat them this way. Thankfully, all is not as it seems, and the film soon redeems itself with a fantastic ending. But that section in the middle was enough for me to downgrade the grade, if it was only a brief hiccough.The rest of the movie is absolutely terrific, though. Apart from a slightly awkward opening scene, the laughs are fast and furious, obvious and sly, dirty and dirtier. The cast of characters are so insanely colourful and yet somehow real; they're funny without being stupid. From the dirty-mouthed female cop to the asshole pair of detectives to the dastardly evil supermarket owner, every character has their moment in the sun and shines. The evolution of the relationship between the two leads feels real and yet somehow still manages to mock the typical buddy cop dynamic of most action flicks; like Shaun it mocks the genre in a loving way, paying homage to its roots while still laughing at them. The nods to other films aren't as apparent as in Shaun  perhaps that's due to my own relative inexperience with the action genre, though  but a few notable ones  Point Break  are not only obvious but embraced. The stunning death scenes are available in all their gory detail; in fact, I was so blown away by the death scenes that I will devote an entire paragraph to them.The first death scene starts off normal enough: a killer cuts off the heads of his victims. But what happens next  the staging of the scene  is what blew me away. Two decapitated heads lie in the middle of a road; the town welcome sign stands crooked a few feet away, bloodied on the bottom and hopelessly mashed; a topless convertible sits perched over an embankment beyond it, showing the signs of an obvious accident, two headless corpses sitting in the front seats. In a comedy, it was stunning to see such a viciously gory and horrific accident scene  but it made me laugh. The second death is a mere house explosion, but the third death has to be the single most gruesome effect I've ever seen. A man has his head literally replaced by a giant cornerstone. To see it is to believe it. It must be witnessed.All in all, Hot Fuzz is another worthy addition to the comedy subgenre of loving spoofs that includes Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and, of course, Shaun of the Dead. It doesn't quite measure up to those two, mostly due to the problems with the plot. Though the mystery was interesting, the payoff left something to be desired. Apart from that, the film is a hilarious take-off on the action genre, at once both acknowledging and ridiculing the influence of shoot-em-up flicks, and certainly should not be missed. And definitely should be seen twice.",8,0,0,27 April 2007
Troy," Flawed, but memorable, epic
","Though an unfaithful adaptation of The Iliad, this is a great movie and a wondrous epic. The differences between the poem and this film didn't bother me, as the credits even admit that the film was inspired by Homer's epic, not based on it. That aside, this is a grand film in both scope and execution, as it recounts the battle of Troy from both sides and has a fair amount of action and drama. There are a few flaws, most noticeably the acting by Orlando Bloom, but they are overcome by the rest of the film, especially the performances by Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole. Both of them stand out with genuine, memorable turns. And the action scenes are both exhilarating and believable. A true epic.I didn't mind the removal of the gods from the storyline (aside from Achilles' mother), as it made the film more historical than mythological, nor the deaths of characters who didn't die in Homer's version, as it made the drama better. I mean, it's not as if Homer's version is an accurate retelling either, as he wrote it several hundred years after the war. Nor did I mind the shortening of the overall war, as liberties must be taken since it's a film, not a documentary. The overall story was very well-told and compelling, and while Homer's poem is a classic, it is not necessarily well-suited for a film. So, I think the film did as good a job as it could have with the story.Though it clocks in at two and a half hours, the tale never drags or feels boring, mostly due to the action scenes and the interesting characters. By showing both sides of the war, none of the characters are reduced to one-dimensional, stock villains (except maybe Agamemnon) but instead are believable, intriguing human beings. The fight between Achilles and Hector is probably the best part of the movie, as both characters have been developed nicely up until that point, and you don't want to see either one lose. The climax, with the Trojan Horse, is perfectly realized and ends the film well. And the bookending narration by Odysseus makes a nice lead-in to The Odyssey, if they ever decide to adapt that one. All in all, a flawed epic with some great performances and fantastic action - just classic movie-making.",7,3,6,23 September 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Flawed but well-made
","Very daring flick that gets points for attempting something new, even if it ultimately drags on for too long. It's well-made, but I felt no real connection to these characters, and felt that they weren't really developed effectively. The acting was good, but I felt Gyllenhaal was better than Ledger, who just seemed to mumble a lot, and I found Williams and especially Hathaway surprisingly good in supporting roles. The story never really gets going, and seems fit to meander along until the climax, which doesn't take on the importance it should because the characters aren't built up enough. Still, the film is nice to look at, with sweeping cinematography of the Canadian Rockies (filmed in my province!) and well-shot scenes. The music bothered me to no end, though. So, a flawed but well-made film.",8,2,17,22 February 2007
Ed Wood," Bizarre, hilarious look at the worst director of all time
","An absolutely hilarious take on Hollywood of the '50s and the worst director of all-time. Though not for all tastes, this is a brilliant look at the life of the titular character, and his crazy antics, strange friends, and terrible movies. Filmed in black and white to recapture the look of films of that era, it successfully recreates the making of three of Ed Wood's bad movies, and the stories behind them, which seem almost too weird to be true. But truth is stranger than fiction, and the movie barely has to fictionalize anything to be interesting and entertaining. Truly bizarre and wildly unique, but still brilliant.Johnny Depp is at his most insane here, combining a weird voice and deadly seriousness to make the character that much more effective. His performance is the centrepoint of the movie's bizarreness, and is quietly one of Depp's best. Martin Landau as the aged Bela Lugosi is nothing short of brilliant, whether it be a perfectly-recreated Hungarian accent spewing out profanity-laced barbs at Boris Karloff, or a depressing cry for help from his morphine addiction. Landau truly earned his Oscar for this one. Tim Burton directs what is perhaps his most visually stunted film, as he is restricted to California of the '50s, but he still manages to make it memorable and creative. The score (done not by Burton's usual collaborator, Danny Elfman, but Howard Shore) is fantastically strange - just like everything else in this film - and the supporting cast is as hilariously brilliant as the rest of the movie. A definite winner.",10,0,1,20 August 2006
Juno," Neither funny nor heartwarming
","When it was trying to be funny, I wasn't laughing, and when it was trying to be serious, I wasn't buying it. It's adeptly directed and acted, but the gimmicky language and unbelievable characters don't make the story interesting, involving, or realistic. I wasn't moved by the climax, nor did I even really care what happened to the characters. I didn't think the third act redeemed the first 2/3, it just shifted the film from 'nearly unbearable to sit through' to 'incredibly bland and mediocre'. And the music was simply terrible. I thought the actors, by and large, did the best with what they had, but they couldn't rescue the film from its terrible screenplay.",3,29,61,25 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Good disaster flick, mediocre film
","Incredibly clichéd and cheezy, but still a helluva lot of fun and immensely entertaining. Fits right into the mould of disaster/survival flicks, and does it ever excel at it. Major landmarks destroyed? Check. One family stuck in the middle of it all? Check. Budding romance facilitated by the disaster? Check. Sweeping implausibilities and gaping plot holes? Check. It's the type of movie where you can look right past its flaws, rather than be irritated by them, and just enjoy the ride. Still, it is a film, and thus must be judged as one.The basic premise is intriguing, but the screenplay falters. Instead of focusing on one band of survivors, the story jumps all over the place - presumably to show off the wide array of disasters occurring. The dialogue is quite bad at times, but at others is surprisingly innovative. The writing, overall, is not as bad as it could have been. There are quite a few flaws of logic - conveniently ignored to further the plot - and wild leaps of imagination, but it fits within the realm of the movie. The acting is decent - for a disaster flick - with no performances standing out as good or bad. The message of the movie is appropriately low-key until the President's speech at the end - hammering home the point rather bluntly. A bit more subtlety would have been appreciated. Still, it's a welcome change for this type of film.The movie's real strength is the visuals. The effects are amazing - save for some rather goofy wolves - as the full magnitude of Earth's power is unleashed. The tornado scene is the highlight of the film, as it is both original and superbly done. The tidal wave scene had a been there, done that feel to it - though it was also pulled off very well. In the last half, the snow scenes are done well and can be quite breathtaking at times. All in all, Oscar-worthy special effects.So, overall, this was a well done disaster flick but a mediocre film. As per usual for the genre, character development is uneven, plot holes are plentiful, and dialogue is silly. None of the flaws really stand out and disrupt the flow of the movie, though, which is carried by the thrills and effects. And, for this type of film, that works very well.",5,0,0,5 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," An okay conclusion to a disappointing trilogy
","It was alright. About on par with the second one. Both are big disappointments, in my mind, when compared to the first one, as tends to be the case with simultaneous sequels. The filmmakers seem to have forgotten what made the first film so much fun and have instead just gone for the epic feel. These films work best when they're about the characters, and the interactions between them - not the expensive action scenes. As such, my favourite part of this film was the first hour or so - before the action started. The last hour might have looked pretty, but I found it kinda boring and rather silly. Not really that entertaining. And the ending is just begging for another trilogy, which would not be welcome.It starts off great, with the very poignant hanging/singing scene, the immensely entertaining Singapore sequence, and the comically brilliant Davy Jones' Locker stuff. It was uncharacteristically weird and bizarre and whacked out for a film like this and I loved it. And the hallucinations that kept coming back were just as great. And then the very eerie and very sad dead ferry bit. But once they get back to the real world, and start backstabbing each other and meeting with each other and conspiring with each other it loses a lot of its steam. I really liked the pirate's council, even though it wasn't really needed, and Keith Richards' cameo was brill. But by the time the final battle happens, you just want it to be over. It doesn't help that it's not a very thrilling conclusion.The problem is that there's too much set-up and not enough payoff. There's way too many characters and almost none of them get proper backstories or even multiple dimensions. There's just so much left hanging. They could have cut Chow Yun-Fat's utterly useless character, as well as some of the double-crossing and backstabbing, and used the spare time to actually add some depth to the film. Not to mention it would have shortened the running time considerably. The film was far too long, and, unlike certain epic films, it certainly didn't need the three hours or so. I was never bored, but I'm sure I would be on a second viewing.The performances are rather uneven, ranging from terrific (Depp + Rush) to downright wooden (Bloom). A lot of the supporting characters are given more to do than the leads at times, which is very strange, and causes the film to lose some of its focus. The dialogue was great (if a bit pretentious) until that silly freedom speech, after which all bets were off. Technically, though, the film is superb. The visual effects are outstanding, the production design, makeup, costumes are all stunningly beautiful and show true care and attention to detail, and even the cinematography is creative and fluid. The score hasn't changed much from the first one but it's still worth a listen, and everything fits together well. It's a pretty film to look at, if nothing else, and some editing and a few rewrites would have done wonders. It's not great, but it's not terrible either, and it's certainly not as bad as Spider-Man 3.",5,0,2,9 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Massive disappointment
","It's got so much potential, but it just wastes it away. It throws in everything including the kitchen sink, trying to end the series on a high note, and it does not work at all. You've got Harry and Sandman and Venom and emo Peter and Gwen and MJ and it's all just thrown together, and very little of it sticks. Parts of it are good - pretty much the action sequences and the Venom stuff - but so much of it is incredibly laughable and borders on self-parody. I could go on and on with the stuff I found ridiculous, but I would take up an entire review with that, as there's just so much junk. I'll stick to the highlights.The stuff that works is the entire church sequence - by far my favourite scene in the movie - and, to an extent, the action scenes. The final battle is quite cool with the four heroes/villains, but it's unfortunately punctuated by a terribly annoying newscaster + reporter explaining everything and Mary Jane screaming. The fights between Sandman and Spidey are very well done, and the Harry/Peter fight was pretty terrific. The Venom origin scene (in the church) is very cool and very dark and it works very well. But it's about the only perfect scene in the film. The rest is just bad, bad, bad.The stuff that doesn't work is, well, everything else. Emo Peter doesn't even make sense, because, though he's got the emo hair, he doesn't act emo at all. He's like the cockiest jock at school with a terrible haircut. It makes no sense. Every single character, outside of Peter + MJ, disappears for like 20 minutes on end, and nobody notices! Gwen is brought up and then dropped, same with Marko, same with Brock, same with every other side character. It's extremely frustrating. Meanwhile, Harry gets amnesia (!) and a butler shows up out of nowhere to recap the last two movies (!!). Very random and very (unintentionally) hilarious.The acting is almost uniformly terrible, with only Topher Grace occasionally impressing me. He was a hoot at times, but very meh at others. Still, he's better than Maguire (silly), Dunst (melodramatic), Franco (cheezy), Church (bland), and Howard (hot but not much else). Scenes which were supposed to be sad were instead laughable because of the terrible acting. It's truly painful to watch at times. The editing is simply atrocious - none of the scenes flow together, everything is jumbled up, it seemed like some scenes were missing and others were out of place. The effects are very stunning at times and rather not at others. And then the ending; to top it all off, we get multiple false endings! Just the cherry on top.It's not a dreadful movie. It's got some good stuff in it, but it's overcome by the sheer weight of its lunacy. It's quite entertaining (if only for the unintentional hilarity) and rarely boring. The action scenes are top notch. But, as far as story and characters go, it's on the level of Batman + Robin. Really. A massive disappointment for me, and I'm not even a huge Spider-Man fan.",3,2,5,5 May 2007
Zodiac," Expertly directed
","Incredibly stylish and fantastically directed, this is not Fincher's best only because Fight Club and Se7en are modern classics. It runs a bit long, but certainly doesn't feel two and a half hours, and is fully deserving of its length. It's basically two investigations in one, but it doesn't feel redundant because each character investigates different suspects and different aspects. The transition between the two halves stumbles a bit, but it soon regains form and leads into a great finish. The first half hour or so, basically just introducing the case, is terrific without much character development, but once the characters take over it's a whole other ballgame. As I said before, the only misstep is in the middle, but it's smooth sailing the rest of the way.The cast ensemble is terrific with Downey Jr. clearly standing out, but Ruffalo, Gyllenhaal and Anthony Edwards (with hair!) are great also. The supporting players, consisting of many character actors, are somewhat underused but just make the cast all the better. I'd love for Downey Jr. to get some Oscar attention - he should have more than just the one nomination - but I wonder if the film is too early in the year. Still, his performance is fantastic - hilarious yet depressing at the same time. He really drives the beginning of the film, and it's too bad that he just fades away in the last half.Fincher is rapidly becoming one of my favourite directors, with this, the aforementioned classics, and the underrated The Game all under his belt now. The way that pivotal scenes in this film are staged and shot only add to the brilliance of the flick, and make certain moments truly terrifying. From the opening shot, basically a tracking shot from within a car, the cinematography never falters, and scenes like the cab ride, the beach attack, and the time-elapse building are just highlights in a incredibly well-directed film.It's not a perfect film, but the style is so innovative and the story so involving that it's pretty close. Perhaps some of it could have been edited down, but I really felt like it needed the lengthy running time to completely tell the story of the Zodiac. A great start to the year and a film that's likely to be in my top five at year's end.",10,3,13,23 March 2007
The Prestige," Absolutely fantastic
","Everything I had hoped for and more. Not a letdown in any sense. Everything about this film was pretty much perfect for me. Great acting, cool magic tricks, fantastic production design, and an excellent plot. I was completely enthralled and involved for the entire movie, and - even though I guessed it before hand - the twist was quite well-executed. The layered narrative worked quite well for me, especially since it contributes to the plot twists, and I never felt confused at all. I loved that it was as much horror as fantasy or drama. The final shot was perfectly creepy. The only downside - and this is truly nitpicking - was Scarlett Johansson, who was underused and never really delivered. Still, it didn't really matter, because this is a fantastic film. Can't wait to see it again.",10,3,7,24 October 2006
The Terminator," Terrific action and smart sci-fi
","One of the best science fiction films of all time. A perfect blend of action thrills and sci-fi intrigue, with a fair dose of horror elements throw in. The story borrows from a ton of sources, but still manages to be mostly original, and actually all makes sense in the end. Time travel stuff can get pretty dodgy sometimes, but this manages to all work out with a predestination paradox explaining everything. The sequels kind of ruin this part of the story, but this film executes it perfectly. It's also got some great acting, from Arnold's iconic role to Michael Biehn's under-appreciated performance to Linda Hamilton's surprisingly good turn, and some terrific effects, considering how low-budget it was. The action sequences are perfectly staged, and the exciting climax is both terrifying and exhilarating. Though I like T2 better, I can appreciate how influential this film was.",9,0,1,15 April 2007
Cloverfield," Incredibly immersive and nearly flawless
","Well, I thought it was pretty terrific. The characters were likable enough to make me root for them and believable enough that I felt completely absorbed in the action. You won't find any outstanding performances, but they were solid enough and never took me out of the movie - which probably couldn't have happened anyway. The way it was filmed, while making the film incredibly intense and immersive, also allowed for the story to not center on the monster, and I found that really refreshing. Even still, the monster, when seen, is a terrifying beast, mostly due to the impressive effects, and I really loved that you never really found out what it was. This film wasn't about the monster. I thought the end dragged out the inevitable too long, and it got kind of ridiculous when Hud was attacked, but other than that, this is as thrilling a movie as you're likely to find.",7,3,7,20 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," The perfect Halloween film
","It used to be my favourite Burton film, but after watching it + the two 'Ed' films I realize it's not as good as those two, mostly due to its lack of heart. Still an amazing film, though. Could be the best looking Burton film - the cinematography is beautiful and the production design is without equal. Love the way the Headless Horseman was realized - simply a perfect representation - and love the inspired casting of Christopher Walken. The story could be a bit better, but the dialogue's great with just the right amount of morbid humour and the mystery element is welcome. Add in an expected solid performance from Depp, a great ensemble cast, and a terrific Elfman score, and you've got one of Burton's top three films. Also my favourite film to watch on Halloween.",9,1,2,23 April 2007
Once," Natural, believable romance augmented by terrific music
","I was actually surprised at how much I loved it. I think it's because it's not a gushy, corny, over-romanticized love story; it's very low-key and subtle and thus feels more genuine. There's no big Hollywood productions - everything is more natural. This extends to the songs, also - they're not too synthetic or over-produced, and thus fit the realistic setting very well. And they're also terrific. They advance the narrative, express the character's thoughts, evoke emotions from the audience, and sound fantastic to boot. And that's all I really want from a musical/romance: something natural, something believable, with some great music. And I got it.",8,2,4,23 December 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Extraordinarily imaginative
","Highly whimsical and imaginative fable, with an intriguing concept and compelling story. Though it's more of a character drama than a pure fantasy, it manages to blend elements of both while still remaining interesting. Even though I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more fantasy to it (mainly because the parts that were fantastical were so fantastic), I became so involved in the story that it really didn't matter. I found the parallels between the real word and the fantasy world very subtle, but effective nonetheless. And, though I had to read subtitles, I became fully immersed in both stories, and felt like neither lagged or paled in comparison to the other. Just a very well-told fairy tale.Technically, it's one of the most extraordinary films I've seen. Great cinematography, beautiful music, and terrific makeup effects. The creature designs are so imaginative and carried out so well that they are, by far, the highlight among highlights. I found all the acting pretty good, too, and the little girl didn't annoy me like so many other child actors. I found Mercedes and the Captain to be the stand-outs, though, as they made me feel for or hate their characters. All of this is capped off by a terrific screenplay. So, really, just an outstanding film.",9,1,4,21 February 2007
Knocked Up," Funny, but disappointing
","I was quite disappointed. I guess I didn't especially like Virgin when I first saw it, but it's grown on me, and I like it a lot more now. So I had high hopes for this one. And it didn't reach them. It was funny, sure, but not nearly as much as I thought it would be. There were a lot of awkward moments, where I wasn't sure if I should laugh or not; it seemed really mean-spirited at times. It was also far too long. A big chunk of it could have been shaved off and it would have helped greatly. There are a fair share of laugh-out-loud moments, and certainly some memorable characters, but there's far too much going on in this movie at once. There's the main pregnancy, but then there's Ben's stoner friends, Alison's job, the other married couple and their problems, Ben and Pete's friendship, etc. A lot of it just distracted from the main story. And the crowning scene - what the hell? Totally out of nowhere. I laughed a lot, but also felt uneasy a lot of the time. The acting is good, and it's competently made, but it's all over the place a lot of the time. Pretty disappointing.",8,1,4,3 June 2007
Alien," Classic horror
","Probably the first sci-fi/horror, and definitely the best. By limiting the number of characters, and enclosing them in a confined space, Scott hikes up the tension without having to resort to cheap thrills or buckets of gore (though the chest-bursting scene is still terrifyingly effective). Each of the characters is fairly well developed, and it's unclear at the start who will live and who will not, which also upps the suspense. The production design is really cool, and doesn't look dated at all, and the alien creature itself is quite original and still scary. Great performances too, and a good script, making this much more than just a monster flick.",10,4,8,24 October 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A misanthropic masterpiece
","The third act was what really elevated it, for me, from another Burton near-miss of style over substance into a full-fledged Gothic masterpiece. I was worried that the film might end on a happy note, eschewing the tone of the film and following the format of Burton's recent family-friendly flicks, but it went for the throat, ending in an utterly brutal, unforgiving, and damn near misanthropic way. This is only complimented by the relatively light musical numbers, which contrasted perfectly with the dark subject matter to give the film a delightful warped sense of humour, something emphasized fantastically with the wonderfully bizarre and imaginative 'By the Sea' montage. The singing is not overtly fantastic, but it adds to the actors' performance much better than over-the-top opera singing ever could. And, of course, the film is designed beautifully. This is an out-and-out masterpiece, coming from a man who had seemingly forgotten the meaning of that word.",9,1,3,8 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Ferrell makes the film
","Will Ferrell really picks this movie up and carries it on his shoulders. I think, without him, I wouldn't have laughed once. That's a testament not only to how hilarious his improv-esquire comedy is, but also to how lame the supporting cast in this was. Heder's schtick has worn out its welcome, Arnett + Poehler are both pretty weak, and Fischer looks great but brings nothing to her character. She's already typecast, I think. It's got some moments that are utterly brilliant (Hector + the North Korea video in particular) but a lot of the humour falls flat and the story is incredibly generic. Ferrell can do better in picking his roles.",6,1,1,23 September 2007
Capote," Not much besides Hoffman's performance
","Other than Hoffman's performance, I wasn't impressed. I haven't seen any footage of the actual Capote, so I'll just assume that his performance is spot on. That voice really got on my nerves, though. The rest of the film really never got me involved though. I was never as interested in the killers as Capote was, and the interaction between Perry and Capote became overtly redundant. The story moves at a snail's pace and never really goes anywhere. The cinematography is impressive, and there are some nice shots, but it fails to make the movie any more interesting. It is really a great performance in the lead role, though not an appealing one, as it seems Capote was a real asshole and incredibly selfish. I'd barely recommend it, if only to watch Hoffman's deserved Oscar-winning role.",5,1,4,24 October 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Typical thriller masked by faux morality
","It's been said that the twist(s) in this film work better because they're placed in context and they have an ethical side to them. But I disagree. This film is just as gimmicky as your typical psycho-thriller, and the fact that it attempts to hide its tricks under moral dilemmas makes it even worse, I think. It starts off well enough: it's engaging, it's interesting, it's got some meaningful things to say. But then it hits a brick wall, and has to work fast to try and regain its momentum. Once the twists starting coming fast and furious, I grew tired of them, and the ethical issues the film brings up failed to move me or excite me in any way. It just seemed like an excuse to present a fractured narrative without falling prey to the typical criticisms of the form. And the end of the film came so quickly, I didn't get shocked or surprised by the 'big reveal'; I just didn't care. I barely thought about the moral questions the film raised, because they didn't have much of an impact on me at all.Still, the film is well-made, exciting at times, and has an interesting concept. In other words, it's just like a typical thriller, not some meaningful ethical debate. The performances are all solid, but no one was really amazing - none of the characters are really given a chance to believably grow all that much. All in all, it's just an average crime thriller, but not much more.",4,2,4,23 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," The perfect end to the series
","Right on par with the first two, making this series one of very few trilogies to keep a high level of quality through all three films. It's nearly impossible for me to pick a favourite, as all three are pretty similar and equally excellent, but this one certainly is an option. The action is even more intense and the story is a natural progression from Supremacy, but the film keeps the trademarks of the series and ties off a lot of the lingering plot points. While the trademarks are all there, I loved how the film updated and changed them to reflect the evolution of the character and the series. For me, the numerous references to minute plot details from the first two films made this series seem much more like a trilogy than most other film series. The acting was great, the story was gripping, the direction was superb, and the action was incredible. Pretty much a perfect summer blockbuster.",9,1,3,9 September 2007
Predator," Generic action flick with a killer villain
","I actually find this to be a rather generic action movie and, if not for the Predator, I probably wouldn't even enjoy it. There's not a lot to this film other than big explosions and lots of shooting. Now, while that may be all there is, it is very well-done. It never lets up with the action and it's always entertaining. But the characters are paper-thin, the story is very weak, and the dialogue barely consists of more than grunts and yells. The Predator itself is an ingenious creation, though, and that's what makes this film good. All the amazing technology it possesses, combined with its monstrous exterior and angry demeanour - makes for a great movie creature. I love its laugh just as its about to self-destruct. Overall, a good but rather unimpressive action flick.",7,3,5,18 April 2007
Léon: The Professional," Looks cheap and feels awkward
","When it works, it really works. Reno is great, Portman is impressive, the two have great chemistry, and the action scenes are exhilarating. When it doesn't work, though, it really doesn't work. Oldman is basically playing the same role he was stuck with throughout the 90s (though he gives it his all), the direction is bland and damn near amateurish, the whole film looks cheap, and the core relationship, while developed well, leaves a bad taste in one's month. A little too much awkward sexual tension. I think the problem is that Portman's role was written for someone older, and, as such, she just seems too young. It's rather overrated, and it's also dated by some terrible, terrible music choices.",6,3,13,19 February 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best of the trilogy
","The best of the series, sets the story going even with amazing action scenes. Has the most concise script: no multiple story lines here, just one central story. The best acting also takes place in this one; McKellen, Mortensen and Bean are all excellent. The whole scene in Moria is fantastic and possibly my favourite moment in the entire trilogy. The end isn't as epic as in the other two, but it's still a great finish to the film. As with the entire trilogy, the technical aspects are outstanding: everything from the cinematography to the makeup to the score is excellent. A perfect start to a brilliant trilogy.",9,0,2,7 May 2007
28 Weeks Later," A worthy sequel
","I don't know which reviewer said that 28 Days Later is to Alien what this film is to Aliens, but they are absolutely right. Not only is the comparison apt genre-wise (first one is more horror, second one is more action) and plot-wise (first one is more intimate, second one is more broad) but also in the quality. In both cases, the first one is better, but the second one is a terrific sequel. And, even though I liked Alien more than 28 Days Later, I much preferred this sequel to Aliens. It's not without its faults, but it's a helluva film and one of my favourite sequels ever made.My favourite part of the original is the scene at the end with the soldiers in the mansion, and how Jim is able to overpower them. It's very violent and gory, but also very powerful in the message that it's making. It's what elevates that film above most other films of the genre. This film is just as telling in its message. While it doesn't have one specific scene that reveals its intentions, the actions of the characters and some very memorable images (along with that brilliant score!) combine to make the sequel just as political and critical as the first one.I was sorta bothered by the quick editing and shaky camera during the intimate action scenes, as other moments in the film showed that the director did know how to stage a shot and make it look good. My only guess could be that he wanted us to experience the chaos and horror of the attack scenes. It did irk me a bit at first, but I soon got used to it and I was able to enjoy the pure visceral excitement of the action. That said, the cinematography of the film is quite amazing for much of it. The wide shots of the firebombing and its aftermath, the extreme high- and low-angles used at varying points, the moving camera which works for the chase scenes - it all combines together to make an expertly shot horror film.The acting was surprisingly pretty good, given that I was most worried going into the film about the kids and their involvement. Fortunately for me, even though the kids are really the leads of the film, they are neither annoying or obnoxious, and are able to carry the story. They manage to portray interesting characters without seeming older than they are - a rare feat for child actors. They're surrounded by an able cast of recognizable adult faces (if not names) that appeal to the audience before being mercilessly killed off - but it's not their film, so it works. Indeed, this may be the first horror film with children as the leads that I really liked.It's not as good as the first, but it's damn close. It manages to look more polished while still harking back to the gritty feel that made the original so memorable. The ending is quite good and definitely leaves me wanting more, so it's one of the better sequel set-ups in recent memory. The return of the great score from the first is another highlight - makes the action scenes that much more thrilling. Just another chapter in the great books of British horror and apocalyptic drama, and one of the best films so far this year.",8,1,5,14 May 2007
The Thing," Both a sci-fi and a horror classic
","A true horror classic. Claustrophobic setting, cast of lesser-known but great actors, slowly building suspense, and terrific gore effects. The tension amps up so well that jump scares aren't needed for the movie to be frightening, and the paranoia that develops feels real and just as terrifying. A great story, because it doesn't reveal everything and it doesn't have to - it leaves a lot up to the audience's interpretation, and remains mysteriously ambiguous most of the time. Because you don't know who gets infected and when, the film is even more suspenseful, as the audience is in the same position as the characters. And the ending, while hopeless and depressing, fits the film perfectly. Plus, the makeup effects in this film are outstanding and just add to the pure shock of the scenes they're in. One of the top sci-fi/horror hybrids ever.",10,1,2,3 March 2007
The Village," Slightly flawed masterpiece
","Criminally underrated thriller. Sure, the story has its flaws. Sure, it's not really a horror. Sure, the twists are gimmicky. But this is an expertly crafted, emotionally satisfying, and incredibly thematic film. As one can expect from a Shyamalan film, the direction is near-flawless, and this is particularly evident in the true horror scenes in the film, the attack sequences. Without using cheap 'jump' scares, Shyamalan makes a scene scary and suspenseful through some terrific shot placements and effective cinematography. The music contributes quite a bit, too, as James Newton Howard adds another great score to his resume. Though the story is flawed, it's still very well-written, faltering only in certain plot mechanics; though the dialogue may turn off some, I really dug its stylized nature. The romance feels natural and works very well as the central plot device, and the main twist, though quite a leap of logic, brings up some important themes. The acting is very good, with no weak links, but a clear strong link in Bryce Dallas Howard - she's a revelation. Add in to that some great costume and production design, and you've got an absolutely fantastic film.",8,0,0,14 March 2007
Pitch Black," Impressive creature feature
","A nice twist on the Alien formula, with a surprisingly good script and a great performance by Vin Diesel. Riddick is one of the most likable anti-heroes in recent memory, and in this film he's given equal doses of hero and villain. The exposition is nearly perfect, introducing all the characters very well and setting up the story adequately. It moves a little too fast after that, though, bypassing a lot of the story in favour of quick kills. Still, the visuals are solid and the direction is quite innovative - I liked the high contrast showing how bright it was on the planet. Diesel carries the movie, but Radha Mitchell is pretty solid opposite him. Some pretty nice gore scenes too. Just a pretty good creature feature.",8,6,8,14 March 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Memorable, powerful horror flick
","A surprisingly powerful and emotionally investing horror film that's almost unbearable to watch at times, but remains suspenseful throughout. The story is the same old clichéd, illogical tale that's been used in horror flicks for years, with a few twists, but the characters are so well-developed that, when the inevitable slaughter begins, you feel incredibly sorry for the victims. Thus, certain scenes are very difficult to watch. For this reason, though, it is easy to identify with Aaron Stanford's lead character and his quest for revenge, and the last third of the movie is very satisfying, while remaining realistic. Still, there are some huge leaps of logic in the story, and - other than Stanford - none of the acting is that impressive. Overall, a memorable horror flick.",8,0,2,4 February 2007
The Shining," A masterpiece of modern horror
","At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film. While Carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, Kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. I try not to compare it to the book  which I've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. It's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening. And it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made, as well as one of the greatest horror films.What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time. It's the destruction of Jack Torrence. Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film, given his past roles and his appearance. I disagree. We know he's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and Jack's appearance only furthers this notion. But it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. He's calm, quiet, patient. He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family. And with a wife and son as irritating as his, it's a small wonder that he manages to do so. But once he gets to the Overlook, he changes. He becomes irritable, angry, on edge. The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing, and he utterly loses it, telling her to 'leave him the f*** alone'. This is the first f-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system. From then on, all bets are off.Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film. We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that he may as well be talking to himself. But what of the other characters? Wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while Danny connects with the place almost immediately. His psychic powers are not in question  how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel?  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness? It's easy to claim that Jack merely loses it, being trapped in a hotel with his family, and Wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of Danny? It appears that his body is taken over by Tony, but how do we know for sure? None of these characters are reliable witnesses. Hallorann probably would be, and he warns of the dangers in 237, but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the Overlook (a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). And that final shot. Has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? Has Jack really been there before? Or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? When talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson. Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose, to give Jack's character more of a reason to snap  and Danny Lloyd is no better, but Jack is a powerhouse. Part method, part improvisation, he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing. For better or for worse, he's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid or nagging wife. We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be able to do whatever we want. Who cares if it's haunted? Of course, the technical aspects are terrific. Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. The use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. And don't even get me started on that score. I don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself.I know King doesn't like this film, but King's input on cinema is nothing to brag about. As great of a novel writer he may be, his screenplays are terrible, and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. This is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it doesn't need to be, and it really shouldn't. Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material. Kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. If only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. And it's got everything else on top of that.",10,8,14,4 November 2007
"I, Robot"," Glosses over some cool ideas
","A typical summer blockbuster that tries to be something more but ultimately fails. The visuals are fantastic, even if the robots look a little too fake, the futuristic world that is created is awe-inspiring. Will Smith gives another likable performance in a blockbuster, and he's supported here by a pretty good cast, but the story never really takes risks and the style doesn't fit the overall themes well. For a popcorn flick, it's attempting to take on pretty heavy themes of the nature of humanity and such, and it just doesn't work. A darker, more subtle style would have worked better. Still, it's a decent blockbuster, and there's not really anything wrong with it, but it seems like the potential was there for something better.",5,0,1,7 March 2007
American Beauty," Very high quality, despite a few problems
","The story and characters have some issues, mostly to do with subplots and motivations, but the film is of such high quality that one is in awe while watching it. Pitch-perfect dialogue, superb acting, and outstanding technical aspects. The story's a bit abstract but I really liked it. Kevin Spacey gives perhaps his best performance and Annette Bening is just as good. The kids aren't the typical annoying teenagers - probably because the actors are twentysomethings, not teens - and feel completely natural in these roles. Superb direction from Mendes and some great cinematography. Very funny at times, and quite sad at the end. Definitely a worthy Best Picture winner, even though it's only about fourth best from the great movie year of 1999.",6,1,2,26 April 2007
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Starts off brilliant, but dries up
","Yeah, I really loved its absurdist humour a lot of the time, but it really dries up by the end and I really didn't find myself laughing as much as I did at the beginning of the film. About the time the film starts jumping ahead in time really dramatically, it starts losing its funny, and the end jokes nearly all fall flat. The musical numbers are terrific, though, simultaneously being hilarious while also being honest-to-goodness great songs in their own right. The Let's Duet montage is brill. And, of course, there's the wonderfully random stuff, like John C. Reilly playing himself at age 14, or the mockingly melodramatic acting of Tim Meadows and Jenna Fischer, or the shocking full-frontal male nudity, which is so obviously an attempt to receive surprise laughter that it's a pretty fantastic joke. If only the film had sustained its momentum, it could have been one of the best comedies of the year.",6,5,9,8 January 2008
Being John Malkovich," Bizarre story becomes too strange at the end
","A rather ingenious concept that unfortunately goes a bit off the rails at the end and turns a masterpiece into a near-miss. Everything up to the 'eight months later' message is fantastic: it's funny, it's smart, it's dark, it's quirky. John Malkovich's performance as himself is inspired. Cusack is a bit stale, but the two women more than make up for it with a pair of terrific performances. The story is bizarre without being over-the-top or silly. The scene where Malkovich goes into his own head is comic brilliance (even moreso when he gets beaned by a beer can as soon as he comes out). But, once Malkovich is taken over and becomes the puppeteer, it just becomes far too strange even for me and the film suffers as a result. Still, it's one of the most unique films ever made and definitely worth a look, at least.",9,0,1,30 June 2007
Spider-Man," Entertaining, but cartoony and shallow
","While spectacular when first seen, this movie does not age well at all. Even now, only four years after its opening, the special effects look dated and cartoony, and the story seems shallow and underdeveloped. It could be because of the release of much superior comic book films in that time span, or simply because the film dazzles at first and then begins to fade. Still, this is a very entertaining movie, albeit a bit cheezy and campy, which works at times, but not for the whole movie.Though the origin story is done very well - one of the best of its kind - the main plot of the movie is weak and pales in comparison. Part of this is the poorly done villain - not nearly developed enough, with a horrible costume to boot. Had the Jekyll-and-Hyde aspect been done better, the Goblin would have been much scarier, but now it just seems laughable. Speaking of laughable, the romance in this film is terrible - some of the lines are cringe-worthy, and it doesn't help that the actors are mostly wooden. Maguire is decent, but better and more believable as the nerdy Peter Parker than the amazing Spider-Man. Dunst is terrible, and unfortunately began the tradition of younger female leads in superhero movies. Dafoe is way over-the-top, but still enjoyable, and Franco is moody and unremarkable. Only J.K Simmons as the newspaper boss Jameson stands out, as he is both funny and true to his character.That's not to say this is a terrible movie. As mentioned previously, the origin story is very strong, from the original spider bite all the way until his superhero status. Though some of the drama is poorly developed, the comedic aspect of it is perfect, and suits the story perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, and the poor CGI is only really noticeable during the close-ups. And the film is never boring, and tells its (somewhat weak) story well. So, overall, an entertaining superhero flick, but nowhere near the best comic book flick ever.",6,2,4,21 August 2006
Jarhead," Interesting albeit ambiguous
","A war film that's not decisively pro-war or anti-war. In fact, it's not really sure what it wants to be. Some parts of it are artsy, meaningful, and anti-war, while other parts are testosterone-fueled, profanity-laced, and somewhat pro-war. I think most of the problem lies with the screenplay, and thus with the novel from which it is based. Since it's basically a memoir of Swoff's time in the desert, it's not a normal fiction novel with a definitive theme and message - it's just a recollection of what the war was like. The book is much better than the movie because it includes a lot of Swofford's inner musings and reflections on war, which cements all the experiences together. The movie just seems like it took the 'coolest' scenes from the book, and threw them together, not really taking time to establish a constant theme or message. It's my biggest problem with the movie.Besides that, however, it's a very well-made movie. The performances are all great, with Gyllenhaal standing out as usual. Jamie Foxx is pretty good in a surprisingly layered role, and Sarsgaard is good but not outstanding. It's directed technically solid but not that creatively by Mendes - I would have preferred more intriguing dream/fantasy sequences like when he vomits sand. The cinematography is solid, and the production design is, well, non-existent. The first third with all the training is interesting, but not really necessary. I would have preferred more time showing how they gradually lost their mind to boredom in the desert - I didn't find that part boring at all, but quite fascinating. The end with them wandering around the desert in the oil rain is where it really drags, as it seems to be trying to say something but can't quite get the words out. And the climax (?) is interesting, but not really the peak of the action. In fact, the action never really peaks - it just ends. I suppose that's true to life, but something a bit more exciting would have been nice. The denouement feels a bit rushed, too. Still, it's a pretty good film - well-made, fairly entertaining, and definitely thoughtful.",8,0,1,18 August 2006
Collateral," Fantastic in every aspect
","Everything you could want from an action/thriller. An intriguing and original story, crackling dialogue, fantastic performances, superb direction, and some great action set pieces. The film is just all-around excellent. Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry and play off each other well, and the supporting characters add to the story without taking away from the two leads. The cinematography is simply stunning, and is showcased to full effect in the film's highlight, the nightclub scene. The end goes off the rails a bit, but it's simply an extension of what had been building the entire film. And the ending, though abrupt, is perfect for the film. Just a fantastic film.",9,2,2,3 March 2007
The Machinist," A Hitchcockian thriller executed perfectly
","A somewhat original idea, with an obvious twist, is heightened by a fantastic execution and a brilliant performance. While some may write it off as a rip-off of Fight Club or Memento, I found it to be different enough so that the similarities do not detract from the quality. The tone is quite dark and grim, but the style is exceptionally Hitchcockian, and very well done. The ending is quite easy to see coming, but the lead-up is much better. The slow reveal of the mystery is perfectly done. The only flaw I could see was that it's perhaps a bit slow at times, but that's just the type of movie it is. The story should be drawn out like this.Bale gives another outstanding performance here. It's amazing how versatile he is. Not only being able to lose 60 pounds for the role, but showing his character slowly dissolving into insanity as well - truly incredible. None of the supporting cast really stands out, but it's not their film. The only performance that matters is the lead one, and it's a great one. Superbly done.From a technical standpoint, the best part of the movie was the score. The music was truly haunting, and almost alien at times. It really fit well with the movie. The cinematography was also great, along with the editing and direction. They really made the atmosphere quite depressing. The production design is quite low-key, but, again, it fits. The movie has a definite style to it, and it works well.Overall, a decent story is aided by great execution to make an excellent film. The acting, directing, and music are all outstanding, and the atmosphere is dark, depressing, and effective. Despite obvious comparisons to other twisty movies, this one manages to maintain a sense of individuality, and doesn't become redundant. A movie worthy of Hitchcock himself.",8,7,12,7 July 2006
Ratatouille," A technical step forward, a narrative step back
","Up until the ending, I found it rather clichÃ©d. It followed the typical animated film plot, and even the end, which kinda circumvented that, wasn't totally immune. I know it's a kid's film, and a dark, twisted finish wasn't in the cards, but I felt that both of Bird's previous films had a much more interesting story. For all this talk of Pixar 'growing up', I felt this was more of a step back from The Incredibles, which I still view as their most adult film. Still, though, it was a lot of fun, with fantastic animation, great voice work, and a lot of little comic moments that added up. It wasn't laugh-out-loud funny, but it was rather enjoyable. Not the greatest animated film ever, but certainly a welcome respite from the crap that is populating this genre today.",8,1,3,11 November 2007
Aliens," A lesser sequel, but still terrific
","A worthy sequel to the original and a large part of James Cameron's resume, but I found the original Alien much better. Perhaps it's because I prefer horror to action, but I just found that film much more effective; but still, this is a great flick, with superb action and a great story to boot. The interaction between the characters makes this film work, for instance, much better than a typical action flick. The marines all act like marines, Ripley's gradual development works, and the mother/daughter relationship feels genuine. And then, of course, there's the aliens - one of them was scary in the original, so hundreds of them is downright terrifying. The end fight with the queen is a bit melodramatic, but it's a fitting conclusion to the film. Add in some great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, and Bill Paxton, and you've got a terrific flick.",9,1,3,17 April 2007
Saw III," Weakest of the trilogy
","A bit disappointing, and the weakest of the trilogy for me. I'm not usually bothered by gore, if it has a stylistic or narrative reason for being in the film, but some of the stuff in this film seemed there just to gross out the audience (like the brain surgery). The devices weren't as interesting this time around, mostly because they had no way to get out of them (though I guess that was the point). The beginning felt very choppy, and didn't flow well into the rest of the film. It seemed to be there just to resolve the stuff from the last film. The main story was alright, the twist wasn't as shocking as I thought it would be - I knew how it was all gonna play out once all the characters were introduced. The relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda was intriguing, though I would've like some more flashbacks into the behind-the-scenes stuff of the first two films. Pretty intense at times, but not as well-written as the first two. The very end was killer (pun intended), but not really logical. All in all, it was okay, but not great.",5,2,4,1 November 2006
Enchanted," Light entertainment
","Yeah, I saw it. I wasn't expecting much, apart from some light entertainment, and that's just what I got. It's pretty funny, and surprisingly witty at times, and I enjoyed all the nods to prior Disney works, but it's just too corny at times. I would have liked it if it had played more on the Disney formula instead of falling into it. The songs are fine, though the one at the ball is completely out of place and took me right out of the film. Marsden is probably the highlight, as he doesn't take his role too seriously and looks to be having a lot of fun. Amy Adams is great to look at, but her 'aw shucks' performance eventually got on my nerves. I didn't find it as charming as everyone else did, apparently. Overall, the film's not terrible, but it's nothing special.",6,4,6,10 December 2007
Die Hard 2," Painful to watch
","A huge dip down in quality from the first one. It's so obviously trying to repeat the success of it, so much so that it mimics practically everything about it. Problem is, it's all terribly done and feels incredibly forced. Willis' one-liners are groan-worthy here, and unfortunately scripted - the ad-libbing was what made the first one great. The acting is pretty bad across the board, as none of the cast seemed to be taking the movie seriously; the story is pretty terrible, which would account for that. The action scenes are thrilling, but so over-the-top ridiculous (like the ejector seat bit) that it renders them silly. There's a line between unrealistic and ridiculous, and this film doesn't even bother to look back. It's truly painful to watch at times.",2,7,14,28 March 2007
Independence Day," A pure summer blockbuster
","Big, dumb fun. Everything up to the attack is nearly perfect, save for some rather inane subplots. The suspense and gradual horror is terrific. Some of it is kinda silly, but it doesn't ruin the film. Unfortunately, almost everything after the attack is even sillier, and really ruins the film. The inane subplots from the first half are widened to become the bulk of the film in the second half, and logic and reason are more and more done away with. By the end, it's become hopelessly jingoistic and patriotic, and far too cheesy. The cast is pretty good, with some great chemistry between Smith and Goldblum, and the special effects are still stunning today, which make up for the failings of the plot. A pure summer blockbuster.",7,2,4,7 April 2007
No Country for Old Men," Emotionally draining
","This is probably the definition of a film you have to watch twice. I don't really feel like I can do it justice after just one viewing, especially one in a noisy theatre, full of restless teens, next door to Fred Claus being played at full volume. As such, the lack of music really stands out and the delicate dialogue is difficult to decipher at times. Furthermore, from a purely movie-going experience, the dark ending feels unsatisfactory, and I know that I have to watch the film again, forgoing the narrative, in order to fully understand it. As it stands now, though, it's one of the very best films of the year.A lot of people seem to be complaining about the Tommy Lee Jones subplot, and of course everyone has something to say about that ending. I don't think these two are unrelated. On the surface, this storyline seems extraneous, taking away from the extremely intense main story. The constant asides to Bell and his deputy's investigation seem only an attempt to explain the events that are happening, but as nothing is ever fully explained, this subplot seems useless. I don't necessarily agree with this. Bell - his opening narration and final thoughts especially - seem to be a representation of the thematic element of the story, whereas the Llewellyn/Chigurh story is an affirmation of these themes. I'm not sure if I've got a full grasp on everything the film is saying - there's definitely ideas about morality, violence, money, death, and the changing world thrown about - but I got enough to know that multiple viewings are required. And I'm looking forward to it.Of course, one can not ignore the utterly thrilling and exceptionally shot main storyline, which, at least up until Llewellyn's death, seems to be operating entirely within conventional, Hollywood standards. That's not to say it isn't incredibly effective. From the get-go, Chigurh is shown to be one of the most ruthless, calmest, inventive and downright terrifying villains in cinematic history. His unique appearance, his physical tics, his unusual choice of weapons, and his very precise manner of speaking combine to create a full, fleshed-out character - but as for portraying a human, well, that's another story. On the flip side, Brolin's quiet, reserved Llewellyn is the emotional core of the movie, making us feel for him even as he proves to be just as selfish and villainous as those chasing him. The conflict between the two is the highlight of the movie, from the terrifically tense cat-and-mouse chase in the first motel to the terrifically intense gun battle in the second one. Though there is no real physical payoff to these confrontations, I think the phone conversation between them - the one and only time they speak - is fitting enough. Both characters receive their retributions in other ways, which is the perfect capper to the conflict. Though their ends may be narratively unfulfilling, I think they work flawlessly thematically.One must not forget about the fantastic technical aspect when reviewing this film, either. The lack of music is very stark and though makes the scenes much more suspenseful and scary, as there's no musical cue to tell us when to be frightened. Tied in to this, the use of sound in this movie is impeccable, and may be even more effective than the visuals. The scene where Chigurh finds where Llewellyn is hiding while the latter waits for him is accomplished almost entirely through the use of sounds - Chigurh's boots on the floor, the beeping of the transponder, the unscrewing of the lightbulb, the readying of his gas tank weapon. We, like Llewellyn, are forced to just listen, but we know what's going to happen next, making the inevitable that much scarier. Of course, as with every Coen film, the cinematography is stunning, and nearly every shot in this movie is stunning and artistically rich. The careful, eloquent nature of the dialogue that has become a staple of these brothers' films is utilized to full extent here, and as I said I need to see it again to take in everything. Overall, just a fantastic achievement.Even so, I couldn't help but be disappointed by that ending. It wasn't a 'that was it?' response, where I felt something was left unexplained and I didn't know what happened. It was more of a 'oh, that's it', where I just feel depressed and emotionally drained. There is no character redemption - even Bell, the most moral of the characters, is not left untouched - no plot threads being tied up, no happy ending. It's just a hopelessly dark finish. Of course, that fits in perfectly with the film's perspective on the world, so perhaps it's a great ending. I just couldn't see it that way.",9,7,16,25 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Utterly fascinating
","I think the best compliment I can pay is this: even though it's lengthy, even though it's slowly paced, and even though it has nothing close to an action sequence, it's never boring, it's never predictable, and it's never anything less than utterly compelling. The two leads are fleshed out so deeply that, by the film's end, you know exactly why these two men are doing what they're doing, without need of explanatory dialogue or rich narration. And it's complimented by two of the best performances of the year: Pitt's rogue, mysterious, and near-evil outlaw contrasted perfectly with Affleck's quiet, awkward, and off-putting coward. I think it's fascinating how Ford is the real protagonist of the film, and how his consuming desire to become Jesse James culminates in a devastating and fitting finale. Coupled with the beautiful cinematography (I particularly loved the shots with the hazy edges) and the terrific score, this is a character study of the highest order.",10,2,5,9 February 2008
Batman Begins," Terrific comic book drama
","An absolutely terrific film. Not only is it the best of the Batman films - easily besting Burton's stylish and Schumacher's gaudy ones - but it is one of the best films in recent memory. The plot is intriguing, the acting is excellent all-around, the action is quite realistic, and the production design is amazing. Nolan definitely knows how to tell a story. I really have no nitpicks about the story, or any elements of the film, for that matter. It really is flawless.One of the things that really separates this from the previous Batman films is the story focus. Instead of concentrating on the flashy villains, this one delved deep into the dark psyche of Bruce Wayne - and showed why he is Batman. By making Batman, not the villains, the star of the show, the drama actually outdoes the action and makes this film much more intelligent than the average comic book flick. The grand villain plot is a bit far-fetched, and there is one too many villains - I would have preferred Scarecrow to be the main baddie, rather than Ra's - but it does not blemish the overall story.The acting, as stated, was superb. Bale easily gives the best performance of this film, and of any Batman, for that matter. His distinguishing between Bruce Wayne and Batman adds some credibility to the film, as well as making the Dark Knight even more terrifying. Among the supporting cast, Freeman and Caine give solid performances, Neeson is good but a bit one-note, Oldman is great, and Murphy is terrific as Scarecrow. Very charismatic and chilling. Holmes is a bit flat but doesn't ruin the movie - she's actually better than I was expecting. Hauer and Wilkinson are wasted, and both of their characters could have easily been written out.I very much liked the fact that stunts, not CG, were used in the action scenes. It very much added to the plausibility of the film and looked great also. The tone of the film was very dark without becoming Gothic (which would have been too reminiscent of Burton) and the set design was simply phenomenal. Once again, it was dark without becoming unrealistic. The music was memorable without having to resort to Elfman's old score, quite an achievement. And Nolan's direction is fantastic. One of the best working today.So, all in all, a simply fantastic film. I could find things to nitpick about, sure, but it would not detract from my opinion of the film. This is excellent as both a dark character drama and a comic book blockbuster. As it stands now, this is slightly above X2 for #1 on my list of best comic book films.",8,1,2,3 July 2006
28 Days Later...," Brilliant twist on zombie genre
","Though it's not a zombie movie, per se, it's still got the stylings and themes of one, and just because it was falsely advertised doesn't make it any less of a film. In fact, it's pretty brilliant. The story is the typical post-apocalyptic survival framework until the soldiers enter the picture, when it becomes metaphorical and existential. Jim's transformation from a cowering bike courier to a rage-filled lunatic is quick, but it feels real, and makes the climax all the more thrilling. The film is making some pretty profound statements on humanity and the nature of survival, turning this from a pretty good zombie flick into something more. It's backed up by some gritty but effective camera work, solid performances by then-unknowns and character actors, great and fitting music, and, of course, lots of gore. The portrayal of the 'infected' is pretty frightening, to me at least, and the attack scenes are suspenseful and exhilarating. A top-notch sci-fi/horror.",9,0,1,24 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Slight disappointment but still a good film
","I walked into this film with great trepidation and apprehension. I set myself up for a big disappointment. And, to an extent, I was right. This is a far cry from the first two, both masterpieces in their own right. X1 is one of the best pure fun films of recent memory, and a fantastic starting point for the franchise. X2 is just brilliant. X3, on the other hand, is a step down from both. It has neither the fun of the first nor the drama of the second. The screenplay is quite lazy and poorly written here. That being said, this is still a good flick.The movie did have its moments. The action scene at the end was quite good, as was the scene in Jean Grey's house. Wolverine remains the best character of the films, but he is rivaled here by Magneto. Jackman and McKellan are by far the best. The effects were perfect, but I would have preferred some more 'background mutants' like the second one had. The new mutants were interesting, but underused. The general story about the cure was intriguing but, again, underused. I didn't really mind the random killing of some beloved characters, but Cyclops and Mystique should have been given a proper send-off. And Xavier's death was too... disturbing. I did like the way they did away with Magneto, though, as well as the last scene which leaves room for a sequel. And the scene after the credits was pretty cool.The real problem with this film is the script. Ratner's direction is fine - he certainly knows how to film action - but Singer brought his writers with him to Superman, and their replacements aren't that good. Many sub-plots are introduced but not resolved. Many characters are underused (Colussus and Angel especially). Some of the dialogue borders on after-school special cheese. Some scenes are perfect examples of lazy writing. And the plot attempts to bring about some moral and ethical depth but ultimately falls short. This is a film which would have greatly benefited by being 20-30 minutes longer and broadening the story. Greatly disappointing.All in all, this is a worthy addition (conclusion?) to the X-Men series, albeit a step down. I doubt it really is 'the last stand' as the scenes bookending the credits seem to suggest otherwise. I am sure that with Singer at the helm, and more competent writers, this would have been just as excellent as the first two. I give it a B+.",5,0,2,28 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Worst of the trilogy, but still fantastic
","The worst of the trilogy, but still an outstanding film. It suffers from both middle child syndrome (no clear-cut beginning or end) and too many story lines (especially near the end), but it still manages to be an incredible achievement. Gollum is superb, both as a special effect and a character. Andy Serkis truly gave the best performance of the film, though Viggo Mortensen was quite excellent as well in a much bigger role. New characters are given the same layered performances as all of the originals. The battle at Helm's Deep and the March of the Ents are amazing to watch, and, once again, the technical aspects are superb. It's just too bad that Gandalf wasn't in it more.",8,0,1,7 May 2007
Schindler's List," Lives up to the hype
","Finally watched it. And, even with everything it's been hyped up to be, I was still impressed. I thought it worked best when it was just focusing of Schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can't really fault Spielberg for showing bits like the Ghetto liquidation scene, or the shower scene, because they're so powerful without really being manipulative at all. The only bit that really falls into emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic, choice by Spielberg.I was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the film was. I expected the powerful impact, but I didn't expect some rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. It's really a beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because Spielberg could have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel.The acting is almost uniformly excellent, from Neeson's gradual growth over the film, to Fiennes' unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic villain, to Kingsley's quiet nobility, and Embeth Davidtz's rather underrated turn as Amon Goeth's housemaid. It's really a shame that the film won no acting Oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially Fiennes for his tormented performance. The story is not the typical 'exposition-build up-climax-denouement' but I liked that, as you really didn't know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters would feel.This was probably the most well-known and well-received film that I hadn't seen, and now that I have, I have to say I'm not disappointed, though I don't know how many more times I'll be watching it. It really takes a lot out of you. Furthermore, despite how much I loved it, it's probably not even in my top five Spielberg films, which is really a testament to how many superb films he's made.",9,9,13,8 January 2008
The Mist," Amateurish and overwrought
","This is one of the most overrated films of the year, and it's certainly not one of the best horrors of any timeframe. The creature designs are cool, and I guess the acting is fine enough, but the whole thing looks really shoddily put together. Aside from that great, atmospheric opening shot (loved the nod to The Thing), the camera work is really amateurish and made-for-TV (not surprising, considering they used a TV crew). Darabont should have either gone for a really raw, documentary feel (a la Cloverfield) or a painterly, stylish look, not some half-hearted hybrid. Plus the special effects are pretty bad.It also doesn't help that the characterizations are terribly one-note and not convincing at all. Instead of real people, we're stuck with some stock stereotypes and unbelievable characters, so there's no sense of emotion when any of them die. Marcia Gay Harden couldn't have been any more one-sided if she tried. And the film's message is hammered home with such force that I'm surprised they didn't start invoking Lord of the Flies near the end.I spoiled myself on the ending, so it really didn't shock me like it should (or could) have, but I really didn't find it effective regardless. It's rushed, it's silly, and it turns borderline hilarious with Thomas Jane's anguished screams. Best horror ending, I think not.Save your time (and money) and go watch The Shining again.",4,0,2,17 April 2008
I Am Legend," A thematic adaptation ruined by the third act
","I was rather pleasantly surprised for at least the first 2/3. Though it's terribly unfaithful to the novel, and that bugged me at times (mostly in regards to the creatures and the ending - it didn't matter that the location was changed), it still manages to take some of the key themes and elements from the story and craft its own tale. The third act trails off into convention and clichÃ©, though, and the happy ending is completely at odds with the book, so it's not a perfect movie, but it is a damn good one and a very powerful one to boot.Most of this is because of Smith's performance. Without seeing either of his Oscar-nominated roles, I think this is his best work to date. For much of the movie, he completely and utterly owns the screen, simultaneously making us laugh and cry, while never straying into overacting or self-parody. Even scenes that could be funny (and sometimes were, to some people), like talking to mannequins, he infuses with a sense of realism and seriousness that makes us believe in the character. Though his final act turn is predictable and corny, Smith makes the character, as a whole, relatable and likable, if a bit too perfect. It's really a remarkable performance.As such, the rest of the film has trouble keeping up. The direction is impressive, never really being overly flashy while still adding a touch of style to the piece. The suspense is built up immensely at times and the action isn't overused until the finish. The production design and visual effects are fairly impressive; it's stunning to see the deserted city, but the creatures needed work and should have been left as 'normal' vampires. And the story, while straying from the novel, stays relatively strong until the third act, where all logic and reason is thrown out the window.The problem with this third act is the gaping plot holes that open up. Who sets the trap that leads to Smith being captured? How do the other survivors rescue him? How have they survived for so long? How is there a camp set up? The film really does away with all of these questions and just goes for an action-packed, thrilling, and emotionally-charged finish. It's a far cry from the psychologically dark and disturbing ending of the book, and it's really a disappointment. It's too bad, because most of the film is nearly flawless.As I said, the differences from the novel really didn't bother me, though I think the creatures should have been made into real vampires instead of some super-strong mutant things. Neville's psychological breakdown is there (a bit), his scientific work is there, and his dark past (brought about fantastically in flashbacks) is there. For the most part, the film manages to keep the message of the novel intact, even if it completely botches the ending.",5,2,6,15 December 2007
Ghostbusters," Sort of a guilty pleasure
","One of my childhood favourites. It doesn't hold up that well, but it still makes me laugh and the song is iconic. Bill Murray is as funny as he's ever been; I wonder if the rumour about him improvising most of his lines is true, because his one-liners are the highlight of this film. A terrific supporting comedy cast surrounds him, but this is really Murray's film. The FX look kinda cheezy today, but they were superb way back when. The ending is, again, cheezy, but the giant marshmallow man is pure genius. Gotta love that car, too (Ghostmobile?). It's dated, even if it's only twenty years old, but it's a classic '80s comedy and sort of a guilty pleasure for me.",9,1,2,23 April 2007
Moulin Rouge!," My favourite musical
","Generally speaking, I don't like musicals. Mostly because of the songs. The two main exceptions are Singin' in the Rain and Grease, both of which are incredibly fun with very catchy songs. For the most part, though, I can't stand the genre, especially the recent flux of them of which this film is the catalyst. But, after hearing all the raves for this one, I decided to give it a go. It wasn't my type of movie, and I loved it.The interesting thing is, if this film hadn't been a musical, I doubt I would have liked it as much. Sure, the direction is innovative and the acting is impressive, but it's the numerous medleys of contemporary songs that really made this for me. Going in, I was under the impression that this was going to be like every other musical  songs written directly for it. Little did I know that David Bowie, The Police, Queen, and even Nirvana were all represented in various shapes and forms. I absolutely loved the way in which a vast variety of songs were covered, interpreted, and woven together to create instantly memorable tunes. My favourite? Definitely 'El Tango de Roxanne', but I enjoyed everything else as well.Of course, that's not the only highlight of the film. The incredible visual and directing style is unlike anything I've seen in a film of this sort before. In fact, it's really unmatched in cinema in general. The acting is very good, as the stars manage to create three-dimensional characters while also having great singing voices. The story is a brilliant mishmash of doomed romance, slapstick comedy, and even historical drama. The slapstick routine at the beginning crackles with terrific comic energy, and the whole film is incredibly vivid and alive.I have to say this is one of the biggest surprises for me as a moviegoer. A musical romance, two of my least favourite genres, that produced a hit song which I loathe, and I ended up loving the film. Go figure.",8,4,5,30 August 2007
La Grande Illusion," Deeply thematic
","A brilliant piece on war and class distinctions and the struggle between them. Probably one of the first anti-war films, and possibly one of the very best. Incredibly sharp writing and naturalistic acting elevate this above a typical POW escape film, but it's the deeply thematic message that really pushes it over the top. All of the characters are three-dimensional, flawed human beings, and the real villain of the work is war. Each of the three main parts of the narrative builds on the previous one, adding to the themes and furthering the notions about class similarities across warring nations. Not the best French film ever made, but certainly right up there.",10,0,1,25 October 2007
The Illusionist," Old-fashioned movie-making
","Lush cinematography and some great visuals, with an interesting but underdeveloped story. The performances are okay, with Giamatti being the clear standout, between Sewell's one-note villain, Norton's lifeless character, and Biel's reduced screen time. The story is pretty good, but can't decide between romance or mystery or both, and the magic scenes - while well done - don't add a whole lot to the story. The ending feels contrived, also, as I'm unsure why the filmmakers felt the need to explain the 'illusion' that was pulled off, when none of the actual magic tricks were explained. Still, this is a very well-made, old-fashioned movie, with great atmosphere and visuals.",4,1,2,29 January 2007
Transformers," Unsurprisingly disappointing
","Just another typical Michael Bay film. It's pretty much a mishmash of all his previous films, with some impressive FX and a silly story added in. Shia's plot line was the only one I really cared about, up until it merges with all the other ones, and it's too bad that it was cut up by lame stories about soldiers and hackers. The slapstick bit with all the autobots at his house while he's trying to retrieve the glasses was brilliant, and the fun found there was sorely lacking in the rest of the film. The big action scenes weren't all that impressive - mostly due to Bay's ineptitude as a director - even if the Transformers themselves looked great. By the time the final battle rolled around, I just wanted the film to end. A big disappointment, but I was foolish to expect anything else.",6,6,14,7 July 2007
Children of Men," A fantastic achievement
","A classic masterpiece in every possible way, from story to direction to acting to visuals. Given the hype this has built up, I was afraid I would be disappointed, but it more than lived up to my expectations. A brilliant concept heightened by a fantastic execution. One of the best films I've ever seen.One of the better things about the script is that you never hear exactly why the world has fallen apart. It wouldn't make sense for the characters to explain to each other what everyone already knows, and no explanation is really needed. This is not a straight sci-fi film, it's a war drama in a sci-fi environment. The story, then, focusing on just Theo, is perfect. No long tales of future history are told, only snippets, and that's perfect for this film.I really can't do justice to the amazing technical aspects of this film. The camera work is simply jaw-dropping, combining long takes with fluid movement, so that one becomes a part of the action without becoming nauseous. The visual effects are great but subtle - similar to Cuarón's Prisoner of Azkaban - and are effective at presenting a believable future society. The music choices are perfect, and the production design is stunning. Not to mention the fantastic direction. There are several shots that had my head spinning. Visually, a superb achievement.Clive Owen was by far the star of this movie, both as an actor and as his character. His quiet performance contrasts perfectly to the scenes he's in, and it drives the film. All of the other performances are solid - especially Michael Caine and Claire-Hope Ashitey - but this is Owen's film, and he excels. I enjoyed all the little touches to his character - his lack of shoes throughout, his talent with animals - that just add to the greatness of his performance.I've no doubt this will be remembered in many years time as one of the best films in recent memory, and certainly of 2006. It definitely deserves it.",10,2,6,22 January 2007
Mulholland Drive," Bizarre, puzzling, and very Lynch
","I knew it would be bizarre, baffling, and frustrating going in, and that's exactly what I got. I knew from various reviews that it wasn't straight-forward at all, but I knew that I liked Lynch already, so I was interested in how I would like it. And, like the two Lynch films I've watched before, I'm having trouble pinning a grade down. I also know that this is the most obsessed I've been with a film of this ilk after a first-time watch since Donnie Darko.It's so hard to define why I loved it so much. I suppose because it's a combination of so many bizarre story ideas that I love - surreal realities (Stay, Jacob's Ladder), tangled film noir (L.A. Confidential, Double Indemnity), strange time shifts (Twelve Monkeys, Memento) and fantastic visuals (Eternal Sunshine, Brazil). It's definitely a lot like the aforementioned Donnie Darko, but it's also very different from it. It's a puzzle movie wrapped in a visual feast, and sprinkled with that Lynch touch. It really was quite amazing.At the same time, I felt like I'm missing something. The main interpretation of the film (first 2/3 a dream, last third reality) fits well, but also leaves a lot out. So many strangely placed scenes and colourful characters that come out of nowhere. I mean, Robert Forster is given the 'and' billing but gets only one scene and a few lines. And the two guys at the diner near the beginning? It's just a very weird experience.I have to say, though, that I loved the experience. It's one of those films where you are in awe the first time you watch it; where a blind viewing is key to your enjoyment. I certainly wouldn't have liked it as much if I had known what was going on. Trying to figure it out is the fun of this film, and every other puzzle movie. It may not be enjoyable for some, but I loved it.",10,4,7,30 August 2007
The Evil Dead," Equal parts good and bad
","I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, it's truly scary, very disturbing + unsettling, quite well-directed, and incredibly influential. But I just can't overlook the terrible acting (outside of Bruce Campbell), cheezy dialogue, stupid characters, and slavish adherence to silly genre conventions. I mean, could the girl do something other than run into the haunted woods? It did scare me quite a bit, though, the first horror film to do so since The Descent. The scene where Ash's girlfriend is laughing maniacally - brrr. Gives me shivers just thinking about it. I think if it had taken a little more time getting set up (it feels really rushed at the beginning), had some decent actors, and a better script, I would have really liked it, as the direction and visuals are top-notch for such a low-budget film. So it's just okay for me.",8,1,4,6 June 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A bit too over-the-top
","It's hard for me to pick which of the two volumes I like more, mainly because they're so different in style. I think I like this one a bit more, just because the action is top-notch and it's very fast paced. There's not a whole lot of story here, which works fine, but it does feel like a bit of a letdown at the end, possibly because it's so much shorter than the other volume. I liked a lot of the artistic touches (the massive blood spurts, the anime backstory, the stylized fighting) but I felt it became too much at times; I don't know if 'pretentious' is the right word, but that's what I felt at times. Still, it's a pretty good action flick, if a bit too over-the-top.",8,0,2,26 March 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A good film that could have been great
","Kind of a disappointment. All the ingredients were there for this to be a great film: classic source material, visionary direction, great star. I guess where it fell flat was in the script. It's got a few moments of great dark humour, but much of it was too light and fluffy; I guess it is a kid's film, but the original film was much darker. Also, it ignores Charlie for a large portion in the middle, focusing on Wonka, and then allows him to win by default. There's no sense that he did anything right - he just kept his mouth shut and won the prize. And the father subplot really doesn't work. Still, it's not a bad film. The visuals are great, and Depp's performance, while hit-and-miss at times, is pretty funny. The acting is good all-around, the direction is fun, and the music didn't really bother me. Neither did the Oompa Loompas. The musical numbers felt a bit out of place, but the songs were decent. Overall, a good film that could have been great.",4,1,3,15 March 2007
Big Fish," Ranges from fantastical to dull
","Heartwarming tale that starts off rather awkwardly, but slowly picks up steam until the fantastic finale, which is executed very well and is surprisingly emotional. The frame tale of the father-son relationship is pretty weak, and slows the film down for much of it - partly due to Crudup's annoying character - but manages to evoke a sentimental reaction by the end. The fantasy elements of the tale range from innovative (the town) to dull (the romance), but all have Burton's signature touch. McGregor and Finney really carried the film, it's too bad that a large portion of it has to be focused on Crudup. Among the females, only Bonham Carter is memorable, as she is quite good in her dual role. There's some good supporting work from DeVito and Buscemi, and the visuals are frequently fantastic. A bit of a letdown, but still a good flick.",7,3,5,14 March 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A bit rushed, but still fantastic
","My biggest complaint is that it felt too rushed. It did a great job of keeping everything that was needed and getting rid of all the excess, but I felt it needed time to slow down and breathe. This is especially noticeable at the end - the final battle is so well-done and so exciting that I wished it could have been longer. Sirius' death was also botched because it was too quick; there was no real emotional impact. The music is basically a non-factor - I noticed its absence more than its presence, especially because some scenes could have really used it in the background. And, as always, a lot of the characters get the shaft, but I've come to expect that.All in all though, I was satisfied. The director was the thing I was most worried about going in, and it turned out to be one of the highlights. Yates is certainly no Cuaron, but he's right there alongside Newell in continuing the style that Azkaban started. The cinematography is simply astounding at times. The effects are truly amazing, especially Grawp (which was actually one of the few things I thought could have been cut). The final battle, as mentioned, was amazing, as everything combined to make a truly intense sequence. The Dumbledore/Voldemort fight was even moreso, as it simply lived up to the hype. The montages of Umbridge and the DA were very entertaining, and the news clippings were an inspired choice. It certainly had enough style.The acting was impressive; the main trio was suitable, and the adults were all - as to be expected - fantastic. Oldman was as good as always, Fiennes was sufficiently evil, Carter was a perfect fit, Staunton was just as perfect, I could go on and on. The girl who played Luna was spot-on, and could have been the highlight of the cast, though. However, the girl playing Ginny was pretty weak; I'm not sure how they're gonna pull that off in the next film. Lupin was terribly underused, though (as it is in the books after Azkaban) and I wanted to see more Snape, McGonagall, Hagrid, but that's the way things go. On the whole, though, the entire ensemble was terrific.As I said, though, my biggest problem was the pacing and, to a lesser extent, the story. I hope there's an extended edition, because there's a lot of scenes I thought could have been kept in, most noticeably the Hagrid sacking scene and the Christmas hospital scene. I'll cross my fingers for it, but I'm not expecting much.It's a notch below PoA and GoF, but it's still up there with them. An extra half an hour or so would have done wonders, methinks. Still, though, it's incredibly intense and a suitable novel adaptation.",6,1,2,13 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," A pinnacle of science fiction cinema
","It's amazing that a film like this is from 1968. Even comparing it to the other sci-fi classic of that year, Planet of the Apes, it feels decades ahead in its visuals, its story, and its style. While Apes is fantastic, it feels like a film of the '60s, with the cheesy effects, melodramatic acting, and obvious use of soundstages. It is very much a film of its time. This one, on the other hand, could just have easily been made today. The panoramic shots of massive spaceships are breathtaking, almost a decade before Star Wars accomplished the same thing, and the amazingly accurate future inventions shown in this film reveal Kubrick's incredible vision. Undoubtedly one of the best science fiction films of all-time, and certainly a major influence upon the genre for years to come.It's certainly not an overtly entertaining or enjoyable film to watch - the long stretches without dialogue and the exceptional patience with which each scene is granted make the audience feel every one of its two and a half hours. It obviously doesn't appeal to everyone. For someone who is in awe of the care present in each scene, though, it's a breeze to sit through. The fact that the film is bookended by twenty minute-long segments of dialogue-free film doesn't bother me at all, as the images and visuals are so strong and so interesting that it makes no difference to me at all if there's dialogue or not. Plus, the dialogue that is present in the film is so purposefully inane and harmless that one is forced to focus on the visuals. Almost the entire story is presented through images; I think there's only one speech directly related to the plot.The first time I watched it, my favourite act was the third one, with HAL. That was probably due to the fact that it contained the most dialogue, had the most plot, and had that creepy robot with the eloquent speech. I thought everything else in the movie was unneeded and just dragged it down - especially that psychedelic ending. Now, I can appreciate the contribution that each act makes to the whole; how the entire story is told throughout the film. I haven't yet read the novel, but I'm interested to see just how similar it is, because this story really is quite incredible. And, though I still don't understand the ending, I can appreciate just how brilliant it is. I think I don't understand it (wholly) because we're not meant to; our first contact with extra-terrestrial will not be as linear and straight-forward as Hollywood makes it out to be, and this film reflects that.The acting is good, the dialogue is fine, and the sets are kinda dated, but this film is all about the images. From the iconic shot of the ape throwing the bone that morphs into a spaceship, to the classic appearance of HAL, to Dave's final journey to the alien intelligence, it is the visuals of this film, much more than the script, that tell the story. And, though it's nearly forty years old, it's not nearly as dated as every other film from its era. That, in itself, is an incredible accomplishment. The fact that this is a terrific film is even more amazing.",10,1,5,6 June 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Innovative and magical
","Wow, what a film. Combining the narrative complexity of a Nolan film, the visual inventiveness of a Burton film, and the pure heart of a Spielberg film, it manages to reconcile all three concepts and become a truly magical film. As with most great films, I didn't fully appreciate it the first time I watched it, but a second viewing simply blew me away and now it's one of my favourite films. You could watch this film a hundred times and still find things to admire about it. The script is one of the most original and probably one of the best of all-time. Kate Winslet is terrific, but it's Carrey's reserved and nuanced performance that drives the film. The supporting cast are all very much supporting, but they're still great characters brought to life with equally great performances. Visually, the film is astonishing not for an overabundance of money shots, but for the subtlety and uniqueness of the effects present within it. And the love story feels true and genuine while still remaining romantic. All in all, one of the most innovative and wondrous films of our time.",10,1,4,26 June 2007
Grindhouse," Interesting experience
","The trailers are fun. Machete is fairly hilarious. Werewolf Woman of the S.S. is bizarre. Don't is funny, but not overtly so. Thanksgiving was probably my fave, it was simultaneously hilarious and grotesque.Planet Terror is pretty much a non-stop wild ride. It's immensely entertaining and it never takes itself too seriously. The makeup/visual effects are top-notch and the purposefully poor quality of the film really added to the experience. The cast is terrific, really getting into their roles and making the characters a lot of fun. It's hard to judge something that's meant to be intentionally bad, but I really enjoyed myself. The bin Laden stuff made me cringe with it's overt melodrama, but, other than that, it was pure entertainment.Death Proof is completely different. It feels totally unlike what's come before it. There's no intentionally bad acting, there's no over-the-top silliness, there's not even the scratches on the film. It is, through and through, a Tarantino film, with it's long, rambling, irrelevant conversations and meandering plot. But I dug it.... for the first half. Stuntman Mike's buildup and eventual quadruple murder was pitch perfect. And then it just nose-dived. The second half is a complete joke; Mike is barely present, the girls are annoying, and the conversation grows more inane. Admittedly, the car chase scene is breathtaking, but it seemed only to distract the audience from the nonsense of the plot. A mega-disappointment.Overall, I'd say it's an interesting experience, but not one I'd like to see again. At least not from Tarantino. Rodriguez at least seemed like he knew what he was doing, as Planet Terror felt (to me) like what I was expecting going in. But both of these directors are capable of better, and I hope the film's failure will convince them to stop stroking each other's egos.",7,0,0,15 October 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Twisted and visionary
","It's not perfect, but it's pretty close, and it's incredibly visionary and ground-breaking. The first 45 minutes or so is absolutely perfect, and as a result the rest of the film feels slow and disappointing, but it all works together at the end. McDowell is fantastic and Kubrick's twisted direction is expectedly solid. The combination of classical music and that haunting, synthesized score is brilliant, and makes for some of the most memorable moments in cinematic history. 'Singin' in the Rain' will never be the same. As stated, the ending is rather weak in comparison to the beginning, and the film does run a bit long, but it's hard to get out of your head once you've watched it. A flawed masterpiece.",9,2,4,23 September 2007
The Fly," A brilliant fusion of tragedy and horror
","I love the way that Cronenberg fuses the tragic romance with the sci-fi horror, in much the same way that Brundle is fused together with the housefly. Though it can make the film seem corny and melodramatic at times, it also adds an emotional layer to a genre so often lacking in one. It's not a typical mad scientist film - Brundle is not crazy, and his mishap is not a scientific mistake, but a mere turn of bad luck - and so it doesn't fall prey to the typical clichÃ©s of the form, but instead forges its own narrative path. That makes it highly unique and a refreshing change from the monster movies I'm used to, even if it contains many of the hallmarks.Goldblum is really quite terrific, conveying many different emotions even while masked under layers of terrifying makeup. The way he can switch between drama and comedy, romance and tragedy without overacting is fantastic, and the fact that he manages to create a believable character at the same time is truly remarkable. It's a type of performance not usually seen in a film like this, and it's more than welcome. Both Davis and Getz are solid, but they simply pale in comparison. This is Goldblum's film.In a similar way, the film also belongs to the amazing makeup effects. They're stunning and disgusting simultaneously, and yet add another layer of realism. Even the final transformation, while being even more revolting, manages to evoke sympathy in the audience, an amazing feat for a monster in a horror flick. Indeed, Brundle's story seemed more akin to the monster in Frankenstein than the doctor, though his character embodies aspects of the latter.This is the best film I've seen by Cronenberg so far, and it's largely due the blended story, terrific lead performance, and fantastic visuals. It branches out from the typical mad scientist/monster movie into something more, a tragedy almost worthy of Shakespeare. Grounded by Goldblum's realistic performance, it does not simply show off the terrific effects, but instead uses them to enhance and perform the story. It's a rare treat in a horror film, and makes this one of the greatest in the genre, bar none.",10,0,1,18 December 2007
The Descent," Surprisingly effective creature feature
","An exceptionally scary, effective, and surprisingly involving horror/thriller. Despite the monsters not appearing until over halfway into the film, the story not only manages, but excels, at staying exciting and thrilling throughout. The story is built up quite well in the exposition, though a bit more character development was needed before the mayhem begins. The car crash at the beginning of the film was so well-executed and yet still made me jump. Even when they are just lost in the cave, without any monsters, the suspense is nearly unbearable, just through the claustrophobic set and dark lighting. Once the action sets in, it's sufficiently gory but also serves the story well. All in all, just a great horror film.The acting was pretty good, for a no-name cast. The girls were all believable as spelunkers, although not so much as action heroes. Technically, the film was very effective, with some great camera work and terrific creature makeup. And the story was well above a typical creature feature flick. The character dynamics underlying all the action was what made the film so involving. Sarah's transformation was very 28 Days Later-esquire, and the ending - the original, international one - was quite interesting and very Jacob's Ladder-esquire. Quite the surprise for what seemed like a generic horror film.",9,2,6,25 December 2006
Inside Man," Solid heist thriller that drags on a bit too long
","Solid heist thriller that puts a new spin on the familiar tale and does it very well. The first two thirds or so of the movie are fantastic, with the entire bank robbery very gripping and suspenseful. Unfortunately, the plot gets tangled up in motivations and the film spirals downward a bit near the end. Perhaps a bit overlong, but the real problem is overwriting - an entire subplot could have been scrapped with only a positive effect on the film. Still, it's a great flick, chocked full of humour, intelligence, and interesting characters.The thing that separated this a bit from other heist thrillers was the Jodie Foster character, who was unfortunately underdeveloped and a bit of a waste. Her entire subplot with the Christopher Plummer character really seems out of place and poorly managed, and could have been much better had it been more properly woven into the story. The ending, which focuses primarily on this subplot, loses a lot of the momentum built up during the first two thirds, and just feels extraneous and drags the film on longer than it needed to be. That's my only large complaint; the rest of the film, by and large, is fantastic.The performances really stand out, and seeing Clive Owen and Denzel Washington going mano a mano is a real treat. Both of them are excellent, and it's hard to pick a favourite of the two. Foster is good, but her character is not really interesting. Plummer is decent but unneeded, and both Dafoe and Washington's partner are quite good. The direction is solid, with several scenes really standing out, although the entire robbery sequence is shot extraordinarily well. The cutting back and forth between the standoff and the later interviews with the hostages is interesting, and makes for a more compelling story. The final twist is quite original and intriguing, though logic is stretched a bit to make it work. Still, overall, a solid film.",8,5,7,16 August 2006
Pulp Fiction," A landmark film
","Could be the most profane film ever made, but the swearing never feels forced or unnatural - it just fits the distinctive dialogue. The stories told are nothing special or unique in and of themselves, but it's how they're told that makes this film so groundbreaking. Not only the mesmerizing, magnetic and often hilarious monologues, but the random chronological order in which they are presented. Just trying to figure out the order that everything occurs in is half the fun. And, though the main character is killed off in the film, he still survives at the end - how many movies can say that? Travolta is great in his comeback role, but Sam Jackson owns this film. One of the greatest performances of the '90s. As good as Landau was in Ed Wood, Jackson was even better. Definitely one of the closest Oscar races - for me, anyway - in recent memory. All around, just a visionary and landmark film.",9,0,1,14 June 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Inconsistent, albeit good, adaptation
","After having read the novel twice, I had confidence that a film adaptation could be quite good - the book was suited for it. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The movie was good, yes, but not as fantastic as it could have been. In fact, I would go so far as to say the book was better than the movie - I simply found it more entertaining. Still, this movie is a (fairly) faithful adaptation of the novel, with a few changes that don't really affect the overall story or theme.Of the changes, the ones I found the most noteworthy were the added character development of Langdon - falling down a well? really? - and the missing puzzle, and of course the end. The end was where the film really dropped the ball - it is far too long, and the revelation could have been done much smoother and more effective. The beginning also could have been compacted - the scenes in the Louvre should have been longer, but the other scenes (Aringarosa & Silas) could have been significantly trimmed. The pace was quite uneven at the start, the cutting back and forth between the separate stories was far too jarring. Even the scene in the bank felt rushed; I couldn't help but feel that these scenes could have been much better realized. The movie didn't really find its groove until they get to Teabing's, where it took off. The scene where they are revealing the true nature of the grail was the best scene of the book, and it's even better in the movie with the accompanying flashbacks and the arguments between Langdon and Teabing (which are not present in the book but are welcome here). After that, the pace really picks up and the movie flies by until the climax - which, unfortunately, is a good 30 minutes before the end of the movie. Talk about a premature ending. I felt the villain reveal was kind of botched, also - it wasn't nearly shocking enough. The scenes at Roslin are needed but were boring, until the final conversation between Langdon and Neveu, where their chemistry finally showed itself. And the final scene was superbly done - much more effective than the novel. A very uneven product results.The performances were all over the place. Hanks seems to be phoning it in until the scene in Teabing's mansion, where he holds his own against McKellan. I still think he was miscast. Tatou didn't really impress me, she felt kinda flat at times. McKellan was the star of the show, I even felt his performance was Oscar-worthy. It's a mark of his incredible performance that the movie immediately picked up once he entered. Reno was terribly inconsistent - considering the character was written for him, I felt he could have done a much better job. Bettany is sufficiently creepy as Silas - the first scene of him chastising himself went on a bit long, though. And Molina is wasted - I think the entire subplot with him getting money from the Church could have been dropped altogether, actually. No one else makes a decent impression.Technically, this film is, again, all over the place. The production design was fantastic, but the lighting was off sometimes, and I felt that some of the art & architecture could have been highlighted better. The cinematography was appropriately sweeping at times, and not even noticeable at others. Same with the music - I didn't even notice it until the incredible final scene. The only aspect at which the film really excelled was, surprisingly, the visual effects - the historical flashbacks were very well done, and the visual style they incorporated was very effective. Howard does a decent, if not noteworthy, job directing - pretty much like all his other works. All this makes for an uneven result.So, overall, this film is probably best described as 'inconsistant'. Story, performances, pace, technicalities - all were all over the place. Considering the book flows very well, this is the fault of the filmmakers. Still, it's a good film, but not the great one I was expecting.",4,0,2,19 June 2006
Titanic," Technically outstanding, but poorly written
","Beautiful to look it, and easy to watch over again, but not necessarily a great film. It is pretty good - mostly because the last 90 minutes or so are fantastic cinema - but it's not particularly well-written or well-acted. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the acting is not that impressive, though that could be due to the dialogue more than the actors. The story is simple enough, but carried out pretty well, and the look of the film is outstanding. All the technical aspects are top-notch, making for a thrilling last half. The first half is no slouch either, though, and I felt the film transitioned nicely from love story to disaster epic. All in all, an entertaining but slightly underwhelming epic.",6,1,5,22 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Excellent both as a film and as a book adaptation
","I just watched it again, for the first time since I saw it in theatres, and it holds up very well. I'm able to forgive liberties with the plot because I realize that this is a movie, and if I wanted the entire plot, I could just read the book again. What makes movies successful adaptations of books is if they capture the mood and the themes of them, not the story word for word necessarily. Too many people disliked the film simply because it left too much out. If they put everything in, the film would be 5 hours long and would have cost $500 million. So I'm able to put up with stuff cut out.That being said, this is a fantastic film. The story is very well done for a Potter film, they're able to cut most of the useless stuff and combine some redundancies to make a great plot. I didn't feel like anything was really missing. The Quidditch World Cup would have been nice to see, but I understand why they cut it - for time and money issues - and it didn't have any effect on the story (still, they didn't have any qualms about extending the dragon scene). The pacing at the beginning is a bit off - more of an introduction would have been welcome - and the ended seems rushed, but the entire middle, from when they get to Hogwarts to the graveyard scene, is done very well. The performances are great, I didn't notice a single weak actor of the lot. Gleeson in particular stands out, he really nailed Moody. Fiennes tends to chew scenery a bit, but I suppose that's capturing Voldemort well. All of the returnees do well in very small parts. I would have liked to see more of Malfoy Sr. and Sirius in particular, but oh well. The kids are very good, it's great to see them mature from the painful first film. The teen angst stuff is a bit unwelcome, but I guess it reflects the environment.Technically, this film is sound. Cinematography, editing, production design, music, all are top-notch. It's too bad John Williams wasn't able to return to score this film, his music for Azkaban was one of the best and most original I've ever heard. The conductor this time around seems to be just going through the motions, he doesn't add much that Williams hasn't already done. Still, Williams' score is so fantastic that it doesn't matter. The editing could have been a bit smoother at times, but for the most part, it's very well done. Cinematography and production design are excellent, as with all the films. I preferred Azkaban's dark, Gothic tones more, but Goblet still manages to be dark in its own way. The visual effects are fantastic, as expected. The dragon is superbly done. The entire chase scene with it is very thrilling, and one of the best in the film. The 'magic in the background' isn't used as excellently as in the third film, but it still pops up every now and then. And the ending is very emotional and touching.Overall, this is the second best Potter film and third best of the year, after Batman Begins and Revenge of the Sith, so far. I liked Azkaban more because I like the book better - much more mysterious and intriguing plot - and I thought Cuaron brought a Gothic feel to the series that was both unique and needed. But this is still a great film. It's amazing how much better the last two films are over the first two. Columbus really doesn't know how to make an original film. All in all, an excellently made film and very good adaptation of the source material. After seeing it a second time, my grade remains an A.",6,0,0,13 May 2006
The Untouchables," Entertainment at its finest
","The Untouchables is a great film. There, I said it. Perhaps that's not an altogether risky opinion. After all, most people would agree with me. However, some people  namely critics  would not hesitate to rank it several places lower on the gangster ladder than, say, The Godfather and Goodfellas. 'It's not as deep,' they might say, 'pure entertainment.' This is exactly why I love this film and find it to be one of the best in the genre. It's not a rich character study, it's not a sweeping epic covering multiple generations, and it's not a twisted tale of corruption and redemption. It's just a damn fine piece of movie-making.The characters in this film are not fleshed-out, multi-dimensional, altogether interesting people. But this is not a knock against the film's quality; like everything else about the film, these individuals are highly stylized and lacking a fair amount of substance. They're larger-than-life heroes and villains. And it works. The story being told is a classical, metaphorical, allegorical tale of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, white hats vs. black hats. There are no mentions of conflicted allegiances, double-agents, or self-serving motivations. It is just the good guys against the bad guys.It is true that the story takes many liberties with the real-life accounts of Eliot Ness and Al Capone. Large portions of the film are radically altered for dramatic and narrative purposes. Many characters never existed. But, again, this is not a fault of the film. This movie does not purport to be a documentary or even a historical retelling of famous events: it is just a movie. Situations and events must be dramatized to create suspense, to draw out sympathies, to direct the audience's feelings. I have no problem with fictionalizing historical events for the purpose of the narrative; after all, films are only 'based' on a true story.This movie is full of so many classic moments that it's difficult to pick a favourite. Of course, there's the memorable scene when the Untouchables embark on their first liquor raid. The wide, iconic shot of the four crossing the street, the fantastic production design remaking Chicago's beautiful La Salle street, Ennio Morricone's incredibly sweeping music  all combine to make a brief scene that is certain to be remembered on many a film montage in the future. There's the sequence at the Canadian border, which  despite my patriotism flinching at the pathetic portrayal of the Mounties  utilizes the same music and cinematography to maximum effect. And, obviously, there's the brilliant homage to the Odessa Steps scene in Battleship Potemkin, complete with a couple sailors caught in the crossfire. This climatic scene is by far the most thrilling of the film, stretching on for what seems like an eternity but never losing its suspense or excitement. It is, truly, a film of memorable moments.Sean Connery certainly deserved his Oscar, as he owns the screen whenever he's on it and makes us pine for him whenever he's off. His character is by far the most developed (despite the focus being on Ness) and thus his performance is by far the best. Costner is given little to work with besides a rather boring goody-two-shoes protagonist, and De Niro chews scenery like there's no tomorrow, but Connery draws us in and makes us stay there. It's one of the more deserving Oscar wins I can think of, and it's a fitting tribute to not only the actor, but to the film itself.As said before, this is definitely no Godfather. In fact, I would liken this film more to something like Star Wars than Scarface. It certainly owes much more to the pulpy serials of the '40s and '50s than the dark sagas of the '70s and '80s. It never pretends to be anything more than a piece of entertainment, and it excels at that brilliantly. Every single aspect of the production is top-notch, from De Palma's recognizable direction to Mamet's solid script to Morricone's amazing score, making for what I believe to be one of the greatest gangster films ever made and certainly a landmark in recent cinema.",9,0,2,15 May 2007
The Fountain," Flawed masterpiece
","I quite loved it. It felt a bit too short, and as a result the story was a bit shortchanged, but the visuals were stunning and the theme was just as amazing. And Hugh Jackman, wow. I've thought he was great in everything I've seen him in - even the crap - but this could be his best performance to date. In three roles, he never seems out of place or over his head, and his character forms the emotional core of the film and makes it even more powerful. I think I understood most of the basic plot points, and I felt satisfied instead of confused at the film's end, but I really liked how a lot of it was left open to interpretation. And the visual effects, despite minimizing the use of CGI, are quite beautiful. Every scene of the 'bubble ship' is quite lovely to watch. It's flawed, but it attempts to do something quite remarkable, and so it is a flawed masterpiece.",9,1,2,3 May 2007
The Departed," Superb film-making
","A fantastically bloody cops and robbers tale, with outstanding acting and superb direction. The profanity-ridden script ain't too bad either. Despite the over two hour running time, the film never drags or even lets up on the action and suspense. It builds up slowly throughout, amping up the tension until the shocking conclusion. The pace feels a bit off at the beginning, but it soon settles into form and doesn't falter again for the remainder of the film. All in all, just an excellent film.The story is fairly straightforward, but it's exceptionally well-written with great dialogue and lots of memorable scenes. There are some elements that seem out of place - the therapist in particular - but they soon are woven into the fabric of the story and just add to the overall tale. Each character is fleshed out adequately, and there are no obvious weak spots among the ensemble cast. DiCaprio and Nicholson are the clear highlights, each playing their role to perfection. Wahlberg and Baldwin are great fun to watch, and Damon and Sheen provide solid work. Among the lesser-known actors, Vera Farmiga does a good job as the aforementioned therapist who deals with both of the moles. All around, a solid achievement.Martin Scorsese certainly pulled out all the stops in trying to nab his elusive Oscar, as the direction is simply outstanding. The chase through the back alleys of Chinatown, in particular, is so well-crafted that the suspense is relentless. But this is not an anomaly - the entire film is superbly shot and cut. The final elevator sequence also comes to mind. It is literally mind-blowing because of the amazing technical aspects. The production design, sound effects, and music are also a part of this. This is technically faultless film-making.Despite some occasional faltering in regards to the story, this is a fantastic film all-around. Though the excessive violence and language may turn off some, for those of us who enjoy these types of films, this is a welcome achievement.",8,1,2,22 January 2007
War of the Worlds," Near flawless, terrifying, and awe-inspiring
","One of the scariest blockbusters in years, and definitely one of the most awe-inspiring. From the get-go, this is not a typical alien invasion film, as there are no wide shots of famous landmarks, nor scenes of government figures discussing counter-attacks. By focusing on just one family, Spielberg makes this a very human and emotional invasion flick. The first hour or so is fantastic film-making, as the suspense gradually builds up to the action scenes, the interaction of the characters is quite well-developed, and the special effects are top-notch. However, as soon as Tim Robbins enters the flick, there is an definite shift from wide open, general horror to claustrophobic terror. While taken individually, each scene is fantastic, they don't flow together at all. Put together with Robbins' manic, deranged, over-the-top performance, and a too-happy ending (not Wells' original, but Spielberg's family reunion), this film falls just short of being another Spielbergian classic. Still, it's a near flawless film, and a roller-coaster ride of thrills.",9,4,8,1 November 2006
Wedding Crashers," A mixed bag of funny
","It's really a schizophrenic comedy, alternating between some of the funniest stuff ever put on film (basically, Vince Vaughn) and some really awkward, really unfunny pseudo-emo/romance stuff (basically, Owen Wilson). The first act is pretty solid, not really overly funny, but not terrible either - it sets up the story well. This allows the second act to go all out, and it pretty much does, as this is pretty much the funniest half hour of cinema perhaps ever. Unfortunately, this leads into the brutally awful third act, which is painfully unfunny and also quite disturbing. Not just because of Wilson's darkly ironic glamourized depression, but also Will Ferrell's way too dark cameo that makes one feel uncomfortable, not amused. And of course, it all culminates in a predictably corny finish. Overall, just a mixed bag of funny.",6,2,3,8 January 2008
There Will Be Blood," Masterful
","I'm not sure where to start with my praise.I could talk about the story, how it tells both the tale of Plainview and the oil rush while also being about neither in particular. It's a narrative that could be told in any time, in any place in America, with any protagonist. It could just as easily be the saga of Howard Hughes or Henry Ford. But it's also very directly about oil. It's an interesting dichotomy.I could talk about the acting, how Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show and is also very nearly matched by Paul Dano in his dual role where you're never really sure if there's two characters or not. But if Dano's performance is terrific, than Day-Lewis is nothing short of legendary. It will go down in history as one of the few outstanding one-man shows in cinema, up there with Orson Welles and Jack Nicholson.I could talk about the visuals, how every shot seems sprung out of the mind of an insane genius. The exploding oil well is the highlight, of course, but there's also the fantastic dialogue-free opening that wouldn't feel out of place in bloody 2001. Combined with the frantic, alien score and the impeccably accurate sets and costumes, this is a film that is both a period piece and something else entirely.I could talk about the themes, but I'd take way too long. I could talk about the music over and over again. I could talk about the bloody credits. I could talk about the bowling alley and milkshakes and whiskey. But I'll just say this: 'I'm finished.'",10,3,11,17 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Exceptionally well-acted, but the story is lacking
","I found it very well-acted, and the characters compelling and sympathetic, but I felt the story was a bit thin and made the ending not as powerful as it could have been. While I think Jack Nicholson's performance is simply magnetic, possibly because of his energetic character, I found Louise Fletcher's role to be too abbreviated, and, as a result, not as villainous as I was expecting. The performance was great, but I found it to be much more of a supporting role than a lead one. The story just seems to be a series of events strung loosely along, and didn't really lead up to the powerful ending well. The ending was still emotional, though, mostly because of the great performances. The highlight of the film, for me, is the realistic relationships between all the characters - I found no weak links in the expansive cast, and the characters all felt real. I found the direction really noticeable at times, like when McMurphy's reactions are focused on during the argument between Harding and Taber, but wholly unremarkable at others. It's very funny, too, though I feel almost ashamed for laughing at the mental handicaps, and I'm not sure what the filmmakers' intention was. Overall, I found it to be slightly overrated, if only because I thought the story was slightly lacking, but certainly deserving of the accolades for its cast - especially Jack.",8,0,1,21 March 2007
Army of Darkness," Worst of the series
","Just continues the further descent of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is classic, and there are some terrific scenes, but overall it's silly, cheezy, and not really that funny. The fantasy horror aspect of it doesn't mesh well with the action adventure element, and the comedy makes it go way over the top. I did like the obvious influence that it had over the Helm's Deep battle in Two Towers, though there's no doubt in my mind at all which sequence is better. The ending is pretty ballsy too. But the slapstick doesn't work nearly as well as in the second one, and the acting, script, and even visuals are all pretty poor. I can't say I'm too big a fan of this franchise.",4,3,6,6 June 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Doesn't live up to Whitaker's performance
","It's decent, but really only survives because of Whitaker's incredible performance. The film really drags whenever he's not in it, which is a substantial amount for a leading role. I'd agree that it's much more of a supporting performance, but it could have won the Oscar in either category. James McAvoy just really pales in comparison, but he's actually not that bad - just not noteworthy. The story jumps around a lot and doesn't really seem to do justice to what was going on in the country - too much attention is paid to the doctor's sexual exploits. The climax is kind of sudden and as a result the film ends on a down note. Still, the script is well-written and Whitaker really does carry the film, but it's not that great of a film because of it.",6,2,7,30 April 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Fresh take on the genre
","Thankfully a return to form after the dreadful second film. Though it's not as dark as either of the first two, it's much fresher and surprisingly sharply written. The banter between Willis and Jackson makes the film, as both are at the top of the game and play off each other extremely well. I laughed more than I do in some comedies. The first hour or so, with the puzzles, is so damn entertaining that it's a shame the end turns into a generic action flick that basically copies the first film's plot. Jeremy Irons is a solid villain, and there is solid supporting work from the actors playing the cops, but the main duo is unfortunately shunted aside too often. It eventually dissolves into just another action flick, but the first hour and the humour make the overall film more than that.",8,0,0,28 March 2007
American Gangster," Thoroughly mediocre
","This is basically a paint-by-numbers crime drama, and I didn't like it much at all. Not only is it just repeating themes and story lines that have been done ad nauseum in older, better films, but it brings absolutely nothing new to the table. The characters are all very conventional, unsurprising, and totally bland. Any attempt to add depth into these one-dimensional, shadowy figures comes across as very obvious and totally disingenuous. Crowe's character is occasionally interesting, but he soon reverts to the 'womanizing boy scout' that is too natural, and, thus, not natural at all. Denzel is just playing Denzel, there's no hint of danger or hostility in his performance, even when he's performing criminal acts. You get the sense that he could stop selling drugs and coach a football team. The dialogue is all very obvious and to-the-point, the sets and costumes are loud and garish and, again, far too obvious, and the direction is uninspired and largely unremarkable. It's a solidly made, but thoroughly mediocre mob tale.",4,12,21,14 January 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Slight disappointment
","Pretty slight and sometimes awkward comedy/drama, propelled only by a great cast and interesting visuals. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, which is fine, but it's not even clever or witty for much of it, and many times the joke attempts just fall flat. The drama portions are heavy-handed and melodramatic, and the romance feels rushed and, as a result, becomes unbelievable. The acting is terrific, though - Will Ferrell is great playing against type, Dustin Hoffman is quietly funny, and Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah are both solid. But Maggie Gyllenhaal steals the show, coming across as both funny and sad. I liked the writing and diagrams on screen to represent Crick's thought process, and the look of the film is adequately quirky, but the story just leads up to nothing. Somewhat disappointing.",7,0,0,25 March 2007
The Good Shepherd," Well-acted, well-written, terribly paced
","It is very long, and it definitely feels it, but I didn't feel like this was a terrible movie. It's just too ambitious. The cast is great and there are really no weak links performance-wise - Damon is the weakest, as he really doesn't do anything but stay quiet and stone-faced - and there are some interesting scenes, but everything is so stretched out that the film is as long as possible. The layered and intriguing screenplay would be a lot better if it didn't take half an hour to tell a single important plot point. It's very similar to Syriana, in that it takes the longest possible route to tell a story, perhaps intending to appeal to adults but really just turning off everyone. Also, because it tries to tell the entire story of the CIA, there's no sense of a singular story or a climax. The direction is mostly solid, but the film is entirely too dull and dreary to really be that appealing. It's well-acted and well-written, but terribly paced.",6,1,3,7 April 2007
Halloween," Terrible acting overcome by superb direction
","Genre-defining horror film, but it's neither underrated or overrated - it's just good. It's pretty much the definitive Halloween film, and the one that I think of whenever I think of the holiday. Carpenter's direction is terrific; his ability with a camera is never questioned, as some of the shots are very impressive and the film is that much scarier because of it. The Shape is a terrifying horror icon, and the character is never scarier than he is in this film. Furthermore, the music is one of the best horror scores ever. But the film is merely good; the main reason is the acting and the dialogue. Pleasance is unremarkable, but he's easily the best of the cast: everybody else are terribly wooden, and their lines are cringe-worthy because of it. I don't know if its the writing or the acting, but the dialogue is incredibly bad. The superb atmosphere manages to overcome it, but this is not one of the best horror films of all time.",8,0,3,17 April 2007
Paths of Glory," Anti-war masterpiece
","There's something to be said for watching this after a few hours of Call of Duty (and also followed by Harold + Kumar and something called The Giant Gila Monster - but that's another story), but I'm not sure exactly what it is. Suffice to say, the great disconnect between these two forms of entertainment, both dealing with war, is stunning and affecting.This is a sobering and infuriating piece of work. The characters and dialogue are a little too on-the-nose and obvious, but I'd be lying if I said that they didn't anger me anyway. I'm rapidly getting the sense that Kubrick likes to deal with the dichotomy between superficial 'high' society and passionate 'low' society, and he expands on it here to great effect. The carefully chosen vocabulary of the various generals and other higher-ups contrasts exceedingly well with the dialectic slang of the soldiers, with Dax being somewhat of a bridge between the two classes. With that in mind, it's the eloquence and articulation of the generals as they call for soldiers to be made an example of that truly angers me, as their silver-tongued calls for patriotism and loyalty while they hide behind their fortifications is utterly maddening, if a bit heavy-handed.But it's also in the depiction of the battlefield where the film really gets me. The utterly alien landscape of the trenches at night, as the patrol scampers about, is a suitable reflection of the totally inhuman trial that will soon dominate the film. Combined with the claustrophobic tracking shots through the trenches, as well as that great pan during the actual attack, this is as well-directed a film as Kubrick ever made. And that final scene, when the soldiers realize what they have lost and what war has done to them, is heartbreaking.Simply one of the finest anti-war films ever made.",10,1,2,21 April 2008
The Queen," Very well-made, but a bit shallow
","Exceptionally well-acted and well-written, though it ultimately feels a bit shallow. Perhaps it's because of the relatively short running time, but I felt the film never really expanded on the themes it was presenting. The story it tells is interesting enough, but it doesn't seem to have much resonance. That said, I found the inside look at the royal family quite enlightening, though I'm doubtful as to the authenticity, and I liked the fact that this was history that I actually was familiar with. Mirren gives a layered, effective performance, as does Michael Sheen - though he grinned a bit too much - and I really found no weak links in the cast. The script is smart and witty, and the score is quite excellent as well. Very well-made, though it didn't have a great impact on me.",8,1,2,22 February 2007
1408," Scary and effective, but becomes too convoluted
","It's genuinely scary and pretty faithful to the story, for most of it, until the numerous twists and false endings bog it down. Cusack is pretty good, as he manages to be a likable leading man while also portraying his character's quick descent into madness, but Sam Jackson is wasted (unfortunately!), save for his one great line. The direction is impressive and adds to the terror, and the effects are solid without being too flashy. But the last half hour or so adds too many twists on top of one another, and the result is far from effective. It veers too far from the source material, and the ending is confusing in the worst way. Still, it's a fairly decent King adaptation, and I did find it scary.",4,0,2,13 October 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Purely chilling
","A film that actually deserves all the acclaim and praise bestowed upon it. Everything, from the story right down through to the music, is outstanding, making for a chilling and memorable drama. Hopkins steals the show, of course, and his Oscar is well-deserved despite it being the shortest performance for a winning lead actor; Foster provides a nice contrast to him, and is also deserving of the acclaim. The scenes between Lecter and Clarice are so exceptionally done that it's nearly a shame when the focus shifts from him to Buffalo Bill, but an underrated performance by Ted Levine makes the climax just a thrilling. The scene where Lecter escapes is one of my all-time favourite cinematic moments, not just because of the gore, but because of the pure horror that is developed without any supernatural elements.",9,1,1,4 April 2007
Blade Runner," Brilliant, visionary, and outstanding
","I can't believe I've never seen this until now; it fits right into my favourites mould of dark, near-future setting with noir-ish stories and lots of eye candy. I guess I just never got around to it; now that I've seen it, I'm sorta glad I waited, as I would have found it boring when I was younger. As I remember, I started watching it once but could never finish it. Now that I've seen it for the first time as a (at least partially) mature film lover, I can fully appreciate its brilliance. And it is brilliant.Definitely one of the most visionary films I've ever seen; it's right up there with 2001 in being incredibly ahead of its time, both visually and thematically. As a result, both films are able to transcend their release year, and both feel as though they could have been made today. The two films are kinda counterpoints to each other; while 2001 presents a relatively light future, this film is dark, dark, dark. The wide shots of futuristic Los Angeles are both stunning in their visual presentation and terrifying in their historical implications. The numerous and at time enormous advertisements show a world with capitalism run amok - not something terribly surprisingly given our world today. This film is 25 years old, but somehow it manages to be relevant even today.The story is a combination of two of my favourite genres: film-noir and science fiction. I'm not sure, but I think this is the first cinematic combination of these two, something that has be re-done many times since. Some may think that the film moves too slow, but I was captivated by the story almost instantly. I would have liked to see more of Deckard's detective work, but there's ample amounts to satisfy my taste for mystery. The issues of humanity that it raises are intriguing and quite revolutionary, and the director's cut - which I saw - leaves the ending ambiguous as to Deckard's true identity. In fact, it leaves the entire film ambiguous - does Roy know Deckard? Is Deckard the 'missing' replicant? Utterly brilliant.I don't think I can really do the visuals justice in words. Suffice to say, this is one of the most stunning films I've seen - ever. The effects would be amazing today, and the fact that it's from 1982 makes it even more incredible. The dark view of the future is achieved mostly by the terrific production design - something like 1940s Los Angeles with a digital edge. Not only does it look great, but the design is smart as well; it makes sense that immigration would get even worse in the future, so the city and its design is multicultural and multi ethnic. And the music, while obviously from the '80s, fits perfectly. Technically superb.Though I've only just seen it for the first time, I feel confident that this will wind up in my all-time top ten after watching it again. I don't remember ever being this blown away by a film upon first viewing: it usually takes multiple viewings for me to really love a film. As it stands, this is one of the best films I've ever seen.",10,4,8,9 April 2007
Casino Royale," Great reboot of a classic franchise
","For sure one of the best Bonds and one of the most exciting action movies ever made. The Madagascar chase in particular was thrilling, but all of the action sequences were extremely well-choreographed and well-edited, so that the audience doesn't get lost, as can be the case with many modern fight scenes. The hand-to-hand fighting is much more exciting than the typical shoot-em-up gunfights. I didn't mind the doing away with many of the 007 conventions, as I understood that this is a reboot, and Bond hasn't become Bond truly yet. Furthermore, the film didn't completely reinvent the Bond franchise, it just toned down the formula a bit. All of this makes it a more realistic - but still stylized - and thrilling action flick.I found the pacing was off sporadically throughout this, though, especially at the end, with the numerous false endings. Pretty much everything after the torture scene felt off; it didn't really drag, but it didn't jive with the rest of the film. That said, the aforementioned action scenes and the surprisingly exciting poker scenes more than made up for it. The villain's death was quite sudden and somewhat anti-climatic, but the final twist was genuinely surprising and led up to a great finish. The dialogue was quite sharp throughout - Bond's quips were top notch, and the banter between him and Vesper was entertaining - and the story was interesting, though there were a bit too many bad guys. Still, a solid screenplay.The acting was pretty good, with Daniel Craig making a great case for the top Bond. He'll have to do a couple more films before being accurately compared against the others, but he was fantastic in this. Not quite as suave, but both comedic and dramatic. I still think Connery was better, but Craig was pretty damn good. Eva Green was a great Bond girl, but wasn't as hot as some of the others. For some reason, she looked much better without any makeup on. And the villain was pretty good in his limited role.So, overall, a great reboot for the Bond franchise, akin to Batman Begins. While it's not quite as good as that was, it's still a thoroughly exciting and thrilling action flick, with great performances and a solid story. There were some pacing issues, but I suppose that comes with being the introductory film to a new franchise. I have confidence the next one will be even better, just as From Russia With Love was to Dr. No.",8,0,1,15 December 2006
Signs," Superbly terrifying
","Terrifically shot horror/thriller, with great use of sound effects and fantastic cinematography. Shyamalan once again proves why he is a superb director, as he makes the film very creepy in addition to the jump scares provided by the music. Speaking of which, the Herrmann-esquire score by James Newton Howard is absolutely terrific, as it adds a sense of ominous thrill to each scene. The story was involving and scary, the acting was great all around, and the ending was a perfect fit. Though the alien does look a bit too fake, the entire end scene is expertly crafted, with every aspect excelling. An incredibly rewatchable flick, too, as I've seen it going on ten times now. One of my all-time favourites.",9,1,6,14 March 2007
Identity," Ruined by the very last twist
","It most definitely depends on its twist, but I actually think it works well in this case. The overall idea is pretty ingenious, and a nice twist (heh) on the thriller, and it's executed pretty well. Sure, it's as clichéd as can be, but I think that actually serves the story, instead of ruining it. The very last twist is pretty terrible, though, especially when the director felt he had to show everyone his own cleverness by repeating the key scenes throughout the movie that show that this plot development does have some merit. It's way too heavy-handed and panders to the audience too much. Overall, though, it's solidly acted and is pretty compelling.",7,2,5,14 December 2007
Beowulf," More a technological marvel than a coherent movie
","Meh. I had low expectations going in, and it couldn't even really meet them. I saw it in 2D, and though the visuals were very impressive and at times stunning, there were too many instances where it seemed obvious that they were going for the 3D 'look' (basically, any time something flew at the camera). The backgrounds and sets and creatures all looked terrific, but the human characters were nowhere near realistic and just seemed to be rejects from the Shrek movies. I feel they should have used real actors, no animation, with every else CG - something like what 300 or Sin City did. As a result, I couldn't be simply wowed by the images.The story has potential, but fails on the execution. I do like what they changed from the poem; the whole film flowed better and it got interesting right in the middle with regards to Grendel's mother. Unfortunately, the ideas the film brings up are never really fleshed out, and before long there's another incredible action scene to distract us from the plot. The acting is pretty bad, not only because the animated characters can't express emotion, but the voices are bland and have trouble getting around the clunky dialogue. Read the poem (and the excellent novel Grendel by John Gardner) if you want to think, see this if you want to be entertained.It's not terrible, but it's not an overpowering experience like it's been made up to be. The action scenes aren't that impressive, and they're made even less so by the fact that it's all animated. It's more of a showcase for this new technology then a coherent, interesting movie, though it does adapt the poem well. It's a fun watch, and should definitely be seen in theatres, but that's about it.",4,6,12,15 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Visually impressive
","I was thoroughly impressed, but that's only because the action scenes were unlike anything I'd seen before. Truly, my mouth was gaping a lot of the time. Luckily, the rest of the movie's not that far behind. The script has some weak spots, but it's mostly solid, and the acting is surprisingly decent. Bruce is Bruce, of course, but Justin Long is pretty funny and Timothy Olyphant is a great villain. The editing a.k.a. censorship bothered me a bit, especially the trademark line, but there's enough snappy dialogue to overcome it. The action was great, but it got to be a bit much by the end of it, especially the truck + jet bit. The climactic scene is aces, though. Not as good as 1 or 3, but miles ahead of 2.",7,3,7,7 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Greatest trilogy-capper ever
","Superb finale to the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. Even with multiple story lines and a broad cast, it never loses its focus or its flow - something that plagued the second film every so often. Superb performances all-around, with Astin, McKellen, and Bernard Hill standing out. The action scenes are outstanding and the effects, of course, are top-notch. So many memorable images from the film. And, despite the hype, there aren't that many false endings and the film ends appropriately. However, this is the only film of the trilogy that is not improved by the extended edition. It makes it far too long and adds too many scenes (Houses of the Healing, a lot of the Army of the Dead stuff) that Jackson obviously didn't want to include and thus shortchanged them. The Army of the Dead stuff, in particular, removes much of the suspense that the theatrical cut had. The Mouth of Sauron and added Witch King stuff are welcome, though.",8,1,3,13 May 2007
Munich," Falls short of perfect, but still a great film
","I may have to see it again soon to let it sink in. As it is, it's one of the most powerful films I've seen. The horror of Munich and its aftermath are perfectly captured, as is the ethical ambiguity prevalent in the Middle East conflict. The message is not clear in either direction, and that makes it very strong. Avner's descent from proud Israeli into a paranoid murderer is very well done and incredibly realistic. The back-and-forth nature of terrorism is also captured well, reflecting the near-absence of morality that takes place. That being said, this isn't a perfect movie.Technically, it has its faults. It's a bit long, and it does drag at the end. It also switches dramatically from an action thriller into a thoughtful drama near the end. The script is also flawed, as there are too many holes and loose ends. I suppose that could represent the cloak-and-dagger nature of the era, but perhaps a bit more could have been explained. The directing was near-flawless, but the editing could have been a bit better. The production design is perfect. The performances are solid and there isn't a weak link. Bana stands out, as he should. The music is terrific; one of Williams' best scores, I think. Whenever that haunting theme came up, you knew that something was about to happen. It's amazing that this was shot so quickly, it's so well-done.All in all, this is a very good film about terrorism and human morality. The assassination scenes were both action-packed and dramatically striking. The plot unfolds quite well during the meat of the story, but becomes lost near the end. I know that the ending was there to present a message, but it could have been done in less time, perhaps. The dialogue is a bit hard to understand at time, but the story is never that hard to follow. Overall, a near-great film that may become great after I watch it again. For now, though, I give it a B+.",8,0,0,12 May 2006
300," Story can't keep up with the visuals
","Quite the visual feast, so much so that the story just can't keep up. That's not to say that the script is bad, but it just can't compete with the look of the film. Every scene of this film is beautiful to watch, and shot so perfectly that one is simply in awe of the talent involved. The big action scenes manage to remain intimate and personal by the slowing down and speeding up of the film, making it much easier to follow than the typical MTV-style editing and vibrating camera. It makes it obvious what is going on, a welcome change from most sword-and-sandal epics. The story is a bit too complex for a film like this, and the political subplot really doesn't work at all. The acting is surprisingly good, especially from Butler, who really owned this film with his magnetic performance, and the film's weirder moments were balanced out nicely by the fight scenes. Not especially great, but very entertaining and quite beautiful.",4,4,7,13 May 2007
Cube," Intriguing concept ruined by terrible script
","Interesting, suspenseful flick, with some great direction, hampered by terrible acting and atrocious dialogue. The overall concept is an intriguing one, and could have made for a better film in the hands of a competent writer, but instead the screenplay is filled with idiotic characters and ludicrous dialogue. Combined with some terrible overacting by most of the cast, and the dialogue-heavy scenes become painful to watch. Fortunately, the 'action' sequences redeem the film, as they are shot well and become incredibly suspenseful - especially the scene with the quiet room. Some great gore effects and a fitting ambiguous ending make it a worthwhile viewing.",7,7,11,17 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Corny, unrealistic and boring
","The worst of the recent comic book adaptations, that I've seen. Attempting to combine the best parts of X-Men and Spider-Man produces none of the same result, and the film ends up flat and boring. None of the characters are that interesting or even believable; they all seem like some accelerated stereotypes. The story could be a bit more intriguing if more realism and less product placement was injected into it, but, alas, that is not the case. There are a few intentional laughs, courtesy mostly the banter between the Human Torch and the Thing, but many more unintentional laughs, courtesy mostly the relationship between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman - which occupies too much of the screen time, and reeks of a half-hearted attempt to put romance into the story. And Dr. Doom is laughably bad. All in all, not so fantastic.The acting is simply dreadful, with only Chris Evans really standing out through pure charisma. Chiklis does well considering his get-up, but you never feel for the character at all. Alba is predictably wooden, but nice to look at, Gruffudd has no leading man sensibilities at all, and McMahon is about as cheesy as it gets. The dialogue is pretty bad most of the time, topped only by the amateur direction and complete lack of realism. I know most comic book stories have to suspend your belief a bit, but this is too much. Nothing about this film seems anything close to realistic - it seems to take place in a media-controlled, brand named bubble. Not compelling stuff.The special effects are terrible, also. You'd think that since all the other comic book films have great effects that this one would, as well, but it doesn't. The Thing's costume looks painfully like a costume, and the other three's powers look painfully like digital effects. The music ranges from mediocre to just plain bad, especially attempting to incorporate the soundtrack songs in. The action picks up at the end, and the finale is relatively exciting, but then it's over - just like that. The climax is never built up and ends too abruptly. Overall, a poor effort.",3,14,24,17 July 2006
Click," Poor attempt at comedy
","What an utterly inane, poorly done, and ultimately sappy piece of tripe. At first glance, this appears to be nothing more than another Sandler low-brow comedy, with a high concept and low execution. Using a remote control that controls everything? It's comedic gold! Gold, Jerry, Gold! So much fun could be had with the idea - it's a veritable goal mine. But it squanders it. Instead, the movie tries to hammer home a painfully obvious message, and ultimately fails at both comedy and drama (yes, it was trying to go for drama).From the opening scenes, nothing about this movie really works. The dialogue is corny and forced, the acting is terrible, the plot is utterly pointless, and the characters are completely unbelievable. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but they are few and far between - not really the comedy I was expecting. Instead of exploiting the idea for laughs, the movie decides to grow a heart, and tack on unneeded, cheezy scenes of emotion that just don't fit. The moral of the movie is painfully clear, but I just didn't care. Instead of making me laugh, this movie made me retch.There are a few times that some comedic genius slips through and stands out, but as a whole, this movie was downright silly. The entire last 45 minutes was horribly done, and were not needed at all - it just stretched the movie on and on. If they had stuck to straight comedy, this would have been at least a decent attempt, but as it stands now, it's just a crappy movie.",2,11,41,23 June 2006
Sin City," Visually stunning
","Extraordinarily stylish, probably one of the most visual films of all time. The cinematography, editing, and special FX are all top-notch. It's a shame the stories didn't quite live up to them. Taken on their own, each is fairly interesting, but there's no flow between them. There's slight cross-over, but not nearly enough. Because of this, the film sags in the middle of each tale, as each one drags on for a bit too long.The acting is all over the place. Each of the three leads (Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis) give great performances, and their internal monologues sound natural. But none of the supporting players can match these three, as they range from over-the-top (Stahl) to wooden (Madsen, Alba) to downright lifeless (Murphy, Dawson). None of them seem able to convey the stylized dialogue naturally. Still, the performances of the three leads more than make up for them.The real highlight here, of course, is the visuals. It's not just the black and white with flashes of colour, or the computer-generated backgrounds, or the occasional white silhouettes, its the combination of all of this to make a realized, live-action comic book. Every shot is stunning, and the fluid camera only adds to the beauty. Simply amazing.All in all, an amazing film to watch, if only for the visual treat, that doesn't hold up nearly as well, because of the sub-par stories and acting. Still, an incredible accomplishment.",5,0,1,29 January 2007
True Romance," Solid with some brilliant moments
","The romance is a bit cheesy and the violence is a bit too mean-spirited, but the amazing ensemble cast and the ending more than make up for it. Slater + Arquette are good, but when compared to Hopper, Walken, Oldman, Pitt, Kilmer, Sizemore, Jackson, Gandolfini.... unbelievable. It's too bad that most of the big-names were in glorified cameos; I would have loved to see more Kilmer-as-Elvis (or even his face!) and Oldman-as-pimp. The Sicilian scene was brilliant, as expected, but I really, really dug the final shootout as well. Scott's direction is fairly unremarkable here; it's QT's script that really stands out. I wish it had been left in his original order; i.e. non-linear. But oh well, it's a solid film with some brilliant moments.",8,0,3,12 July 2007
Evil Dead II," Much the same as the first
","It's nearly as good as the original, and it has the same problems as well. It's just as fantastically directed, has better effects, and Bruce Campbell truly personifies Ash in this one, but the supporting cast is weak at best, the story is lame, and the pacing is even more strange. The beginning of the flick, with just Ash alone in the cabin doing his best horror slapstick, is so excellent that you just want it to span the entire film, but, unfortunately, it does not. Another silly story and some more stupid characters are in store, instead. From that point on, it just feels like a remake of the original, making it rather boring and somewhat of a chore to sit through. The scene where Ash 'becomes' Ash is brilliant though.",8,0,3,6 June 2007
Atonement," Lifeless, bland, insert adjective here
","Wow, I'm not even sure I saw the same movie as most of you. I found it to be blandly directed and almost totally lifeless from beginning to end. Even the much-ballyhooed one-take, which I would normally be a huge fan of, didn't move me or excite me at all. I just followed it mindlessly. I suppose my problem is I didn't buy any of it: I didn't buy the romance, I didn't buy the tragedy, I didn't buy Briony's regret. I actually kinda liked the first third-ish, up until Robby was arrested. It set up the story in an interesting way; it craftily showed Briony's distorted perception, which culminated in her false accusation. But once the story shifts to Robby and the war it just dies. We should have stayed with Briony the whole time, seen her grow up, seen her regret worsen and deepen, seen her ultimate act of atonement as actually meaning something. But instead we're left with some shoddy war scenes, a choppy final act, and a completely unfair and unrealistic ending.I mean, it's not terrible. I thought Ronan was terrific and the dialogue (at least in that first third) was sharp and witty and enjoyable. But after just having seen TWBB, it just doesn't even compare.",4,3,6,17 February 2008
V for Vendetta," Lots of potential but ultimately disappoints
","A film that had so much potential and, sadly, falls short. Both thematically and technically it is flawed, leading to a disappointing result. Still, it is decently well-made and intriguing at times, but ultimately it is crushed under the weight of its message. I couldn't help but be reminded of 1984 constantly throughout the film, and kept contrasting this film to the Orwell novel. There is no question in my mind that the novel is far superior - it deals with similar issues in a much more subtle (and effective) manner. There is no superheroes to be found in 1984. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of this film, and that is its downfall.The basic story is too clichéd to really make an impact, and it is even further bogged down by pointless sub-plots (I found the 'lesbian fairy tale' to be utterly pointless and do nothing but slow the pace down) and numerous dead ends. Too many questions were left unanswered for the film, and its message, to make a powerful impact. There are some interesting ideas at work here (I liked the notion of the United States being embroiled in a second civil war) but they are poorly handled. The characters are mostly stock heroes or villains (the masked vigilante, the damsel in distress, the cop looking for redemption, the evil dictator) but the actors fill out the roles nicely. Weaving, though we don't see his face, does a great job with the dialogue, and Portman is good. Of the supporting actors, Rea is by far the best, making his character quite believable. All in all, though, the theme of the movie is lost amongst the action scenes and confusing story.The budget was lower than I would have thought, and it showed on the screen. Some of the visual effects were nice (especially the final shot of the Parliament buildings blowing up) but the sound mixing is simply dreadful, sometimes so bad that you can't hear the actors talk. The directing is merely adequate, and the editing is faulty sometimes. And the action scenes were far too Matrix-y for my liking. Try something new, Wachowskis.Overall, this was a good film, but something felt off throughout it. I can't put my finger directly on it, but it's 'like a splinter in my mind, driving me mad'. The acting was good at times and not at others, the dialogue ranged from superb to downright cheesy, and the technicalities of the film wavered horribly. I guess the best word to describe this film is inconsistent. Still, it was well-made and thought-provoking, and that is enough for me to give it a B.",6,1,3,29 May 2006
