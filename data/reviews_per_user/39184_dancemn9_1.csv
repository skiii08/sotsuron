The Blair Witch Project," I was disappointed
","I seem to be mostly alone in this opinion, but this movie didn't frighten me much--it didn't make me feel much of anything.  I didn't particularly like or relate to any of the three students, and the more they wandered around in the woods, the more I shook my head and said, 'How dumb can you BE?'  I already knew that none of them would make it out alive (from the film tag line), so there was no suspense involved.  Only the last five minutes of the film gripped me.  Even then, the ending was hardly a surprise.On the positive side, it was a very creative idea, and I appreciated the absence of blood and violence.If it was not a particularly bad film, neither was it an exceptionally good one.  After all of the non-hype hype, I must say I was disappointed.",7,1,1,1 August 1999
