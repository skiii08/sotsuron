Walk the Line," A load of crap on par with The Doors
","Lets take the myth and create a story so shallow and trite that you can't help but think 'Why was this movie made?' Mr. Phoenix is a mediocre actor and unsuited for such a complex character as Johnny Cash-- First and foremost:I don't care that he didn't sound like Cash-he never got the vocal inflection. He sang as if he never listened to more than a song or two... Johnny Cash was as much about phrasing as the depth of his baritone(neither which Phoenix had). Remember when Kurt Russell played Elvis-his acting skills made you forget that he didn't resemble the king-Mr. Phoenix has just the opposite problem. Just because the physical resemblance is there, doesn't mean you make a convincing Johnny Cash. On the plus side-Reese Witherspoon did a fine, believable job as June Carter-except that towards the end she didn't look old enough (June had three years on Johnny).This movie is on par with Oliver Stones The Doors: All myth and little substance. As a side note I immediately noticed Johnny taking the cigarette out of Luthers mouth (and the irony of his future death)",3,8,16,12 March 2006
