The Blair Witch Project," Not that hot
","So, it's been hyped to death as most films seem to be these days, but is it really any good? In my opinion, no. The film makes clever use of the home movie style footage, but the whole thing is a complete waste of time. Hardly anything actually happens in the film apart from a lot of noise and blurred pictures. This could be argued to contribute to the chill factor of the film, but in my opinion it really just annoys by not ever actually showing what is going on. You probably think I'm just not getting it, but I would say that I get what it is supposed to be, but it really isn't that. I'm not asking for a gore slasher fest, but I really don't want to sit through over an hour of poor quality rubbish.Controversial? Sure. So be it!",1,2,3,14 September 1999

","sorry, I'd love to stay and review FOTR, but I'm going back to the movie theatre to see it again, I may possibly take up permanent residence in front of this movie. Please go and watch it now, no words I can write here will describe it adequately.",10,0,0,21 December 2001
