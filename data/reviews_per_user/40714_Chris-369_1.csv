The Blair Witch Project," Frightening.
","What can be said about this film? If you are looking for instant scares (i.e. Scream, IKWYDLS) then this film is not for you.The clever aspect of this movie is that it is not overly scary as you actually watch it.  It is after the film has ended and you think back over what you have witnessed when it has its full effect.  The Blair Witch Project may well have you scared to get up in the night for weeks.The best way to describe this film would be to say that it does not offer you any relief from you fear.In the majority of horror or scary films,the viewer sucks their breath in and curses at the stupid person who is cautiously going up the stairs to investigate the scary noise that came from up there moments ago.  The viewer then breathes a sigh of relief when it is discovered that it was simple a cat knocking over a vase. TBWP does not offer you the chance to breathe that sigh of relief, you are simply left on edge because whatever is making the noise is left anonymous.The idea of leaving so many questions unanswered is genius.Look at it this way - when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear a strange noise you get scared, however you are relieved when you realise that it is simply your parents going to bed or the central heating going off. TBWP does not resolve your fear, you are left wondering what the noise was. To summarise; the noises you hear in the night are always more frightening that whatever is actually making them.",9,1,1,15 September 1999
