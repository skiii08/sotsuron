Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Man, The Bride, The Flute, The Sword
","So it has come to this. From the first eastern-flavored outing of the revenge of the bride, the action moves just a bit to the west to Italy. Having clearly seen one to many Sergio Leone flicks, there's a complete shift in pace and tone in this second volume.The Bride is back, the usage of fake blood was reduced, the plot thickens and so do the characters. They're far more fleshed out this time and I was quite happy to welcome back the quirks and fanboytalk of a 'usual' Tarantino-Script (> Superman anyone?)But: Does it deliver? Does it all add up? Yes! The fight of Elle and the bride is one of a kind. Beautifully shot, beautifully cut, tough, vicious and violent. The included Flashbacks throughout the film give lots more information on the who, what and why and come the final act, you can't help but care about all the characters. As a whole, Kill Bill offers the essence of all those trash-films, we just love to watch and Tarantino successfully shows his affection in this ultimate homage-movie. If you don't like the originals, you won't like this. But if you indeed do like 'em, he just brought the best Luxury-Trash-Movie to a noble end!",10,1,2,16 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A worthy follow up
","Now, who would have thought! The story's starting to build up very nicely and the whole patchwork of open links are starting to make sense. Darth Sidious plan to conquer the universe shapes up and future actions are hinted.George Lucas uses an array of spectacular visuals to set the scene for our two lovebirds and battalions of fighters to get it on. He even brings back the beloved 70ies zoom-function (through some fluid CG-created creatures).Now I just have to wait 3 more years for the next installment... so be it...",10,0,0,15 May 2002
Ice Age," Very nice looking pic!
","Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking film. The story is simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design.More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour. Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality. Including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering.Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how.Enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.",7,32,41,5 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Delivers on every level
","I was fortunate to see this film at the press-screening and it didn't let me down one bit.An overlong running time, filled with action, suspense, drama and one of the greatest battle-sequences ever filmed. It's a safe bet, that if you liked the first two installments, you'll like that one as well.Technically, it's top notch! Where the second one was a bit rough around the edges (especially the Warg-Riders, this one is a big step forward. Gollum has even more punch this time around!LORD OF THE RINGS is now completed and here to stay. One of the greatest books turned into one of the greatest films and there will be generations benefiting from the pure imagination both of them delivered so deliberately.Hollywood, please take note, that in these dark times, we need films with heart and passion to get us through. LORD OF THE RINGS is the best example of how this is achieved.",9,0,0,11 December 2003
