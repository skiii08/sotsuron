Requiem for a Dream," This movie has it all
","This movie really does have it all. The story is great, and is carried out by 4 great acting persons. Then there's the camera work, this is superb. The director makes excellent use of good camera views, and this really adds something special to the movie. The music is great too, no wonder they used it for Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The sound effects you hear occasionally are very good, they create a special sphere that also adds to the movie. The cutscenes, used a lot in the movie, are perfect. They are really well done and these too add to the movie. All things considered, this really is a movie you've got to see, and you will love from the first minute you see",9,0,0,11 April 2003
The Others," Comparable to The Sixth Sense
","The Others is a great movie, comparable to The Sixth Sense. The movie has humor in it, some pretty frightening scenes, and a great ending I won't spoil here. If you liked The Sixth Sense, and/or other ghost movies, you will definitely like The Others too",9,0,0,4 April 2003
The Fast and the Furious," Good car-movie
","The Fast and the Furious is a good movie about cars. The cars look superb, the females are good looking, the camera work is great and the story is quite good too. Definitely worth to watch if you like fast cars",7,2,2,7 March 2003
8 Mile," Only for hip-hop fans
","8 Mile is a good movie, if you like hip-hop. 8 Mile is based on Eminems life, and if you don't like rap music it probably isn't any fun. A big part of the movie is about 'rap battles', two rappers rapping against each other. If you don't like that, the movie is only half the fun.",8,0,0,30 March 2003
