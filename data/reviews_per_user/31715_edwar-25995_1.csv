It," Excellent movie for a multitude of reasons
","I had high expectations going into this film and I was not disappointed. This film as so many great aspects with honestly very few, if any down falls. Pennywise is terrifying not only from the great acting and CGI, but also the atmosphere and shadowing used to make the scenes so tense and terrifying. Compared to the 1990 IT, this film walks the line of horror quite a bit more but still has lighter moments to bring relief from all the intensity. Unlike most other horror movies, the story line in this movie is well developed and ties in nicely with the story of Pennywise. Great movie, glad I saw it in theaters.",9,4,8,12 September 2017
