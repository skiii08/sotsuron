E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Critically Acclaimed '80s Blockbuster
","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is timeless, visually impressive and directorially phenomenal, that being said, while I appreciate all the uniqueness of the film, I don't really understand the universal acclaim as one of the all-time greats in cinema, nor do I agree with those who claim it to be one of the best movies of the 1980s.Nevertheless, E.T. is a very enjoyable movie, a simple yet poetic story about loneliness. With a charming family-friendly basis coinciding with a not-so family friendly script, that is where the obscenities wear off and are replaced with a heartfelt story that anybody can enjoy. Even if you don't completely enjoy the film, you can still absorb the genius of Steven Spielberg and the incredibly impressive science fiction design of the focal alien 'E.T.'There isn't much else worth mentioning though, a stellar soundtrack is composed by the always-ambient John Williams, and the writing is worthwhile with a few quotable and memorable lines. Whether it captured your heart or merely just your attention, I'm sure you have one or two nice things to say about this massive, critically acclaimed '80s blockbuster.",8,1,1,23 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Return
","Where do I start? A wonderful ending to a much loved trilogy of films, a magnificent display of science fiction visuals, and a master class in character development. It is a charming and fitting finale to the expanded universe of Star Wars; at this point in time anyway, we can only hope for a decent seventh instalmentWhile often considered to not be on the same level as episodes IV and V, episode VI at least serves its own purpose in the franchise; a fine purpose that all fantasy and adventure stories have a happy ending. We finally get to see the movie industry's greatest antagonist in a good light and we get more startling discoveries as the story goes on, but I won't mention any here, just in case of that one in a million chance that you're reading this and you haven't seen this movie yet.There's really not much to say that I haven't already said for the other two films in the original Star Wars trilogy. The musical score is top notch as ever, but I have to say that I much prefer the track 'Victory Celebration' from the film's re-releases than the song 'Yub Nub' which was used in the film's original celebration scene. I just find 'Victory Celebration' to be so much more ambient as everybody celebrates and reunites, and what a reunion scene it is, but once again I'll let you find out for yourself, though I am aware I could click the 'spoiler alert' button.But yes, the creative imagination of George Lucas returned with 'Return', so let's hope for the best for the future of the greatest Sci-fi series ever made!",9,0,0,11 April 2013
Pulp Fiction," Instant Classic - The Best Movie of the '90s
","Quentin Tarantino's first masterpiece. The highly and critically acclaimed 1994 movie became a quick cult classic with its unconventional structure, immensely witty dialogue and great examples of excellent casting.While there is no absolute lead actor or main character, John Travolta became the real shining star of the film as he went from an almost forgotten celebrity to a surprise academy award nominee. Opinions of Travolta skyrocketed after his admirable performance in Pulp Fiction, made even more special with Quentin Tarantino by his side, with his script and his vision. Other actors who made Tarantino's casting ability reign significant were Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and a small Christopher Walken role.The brilliant casting went on to create brilliant characters. These characters were brought to life by their portrayals, witty dialogue, memorable moments and top notch chemistry; everybody remembers this movie for fantastic philosophical and psychological pieces of long dialogue that never get boring, mostly involving Travolta and Jackson, or to an even greater degree, Travolta and Thurman. It's hard to keep describing the characters, story and memorable scenes because there is just so much and too much to talk about, it's just much easier to say that everybody involved in the process did a great job.There is something in Pulp Fiction for everyone, for every die-hard movie fan, to every aspiring director or writer, to every casual cinema- goer. There is action, violence significant to the film's shape and style, quintessential Tarantino trademarks, some fine notable qualities on the visual and design side of things and an incredibly memorable soundtrack, the latter of all these qualities perhaps being the most enjoyable generally. I really can't think of a movie that portrays better utilisation of a non-original score than this, with every song used as a device to set the mood, to capture your attention or to fit in nicely with the cinematography in its own sense of aloofness. The soundtrack boasts a fine array of surf rock and funk/soul music.Of course, what will always be remembered, what will almost make Pulp Fiction innovative is the series of basic stories, made not-so-basic with an intriguing, non-chronological structure. The movie ends with a scene that takes place before the first main story that is presented, that being John Travolta's character Vincent Vega taking his boss's wife Mia Wallace (Thurman) out. But don't worry; you won't need a synopsis written out for you as you watch the movie, because in pure Tarantino style, it is complicated but at the same time consumable. And speaking of, the main accolade here is quite simply the remarkable job done by Quentin Tarantino in his second feature length directing effort. Made slightly frustrating by not being able to direct some of his earlier screenplays, the man knew that he was made to be a success in the movie industry, and after the release of Pulp Fiction, everybody knew it.Pulp Fiction taught us so many things, not just what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France, but also not to have such a conservative outlook on movies. With a legacy that will always live on, Pulp Fiction is simply put, my favourite movie. I envy anybody who still hasn't watched it, you are really in for a treat. It is one of the all-time greatest films, and if you disagree then I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger. *****",10,0,2,15 March 2013
Psycho," Hitchcock's Best
","I envy anybody who is watching this for the first time; 'Psycho' is a tremendous staple of directing performances, horror movies and cinema in general. Alfred Hitchcock's quality in ability makes itself known with the famous 'eye shot' of Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) and the most perfect examples of suspense in films.But the greatness doesn't end there, the eerie and gloomy exterior shots equal to notable cinematography, Norman Bates' (played by Anthony Perkins) sense of growing insanity and subtle desperation equals to one fine acting performance, and the well-acted dialogue scenes equal to the growth of plot suspense and magnificent character development. As mentioned, Anthony Perkins delivers a great display as motel owner Norman Bates, a great display of acting that keeps the audience in deep suspense. What's more prolific is the iconic 'shower scene', which makes use of the excellent orchestral string stabs along withwell, actual stabs.One of the greatest and most influential stories in the history of fiction, along with insanely eerie outcomes, 'Psycho' really is a must- see for any movie fan.",9,0,0,23 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," An Absolute Must-See
","The third instalment in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is an absolute must-see for any fan of the franchise. The man who brought more edge and cinematic acceptability to an already well-loved series has once again achieved excellence in said field; the edginess is there with daring story-telling, and the acceptability is there with box office success and a mass amount of positive reviews.While a great movie, any sequel is going to be compared to it's predecessors, and in this case, you have to give so much praise to 'The Dark Knight', Nolan's second in the series. 'The Dark Knight Rises' has phenomenal cinematography values and some of the best written dialogue in a super hero movie, but none of this compares to the story, character development or masterful acting, the latter of which is what these films tend to lack, not that that's supposed to hinder the value of such a movie. Also, after Nolan had achieved his 'boundaries-pushing' reputation, this instalment doesn't allow him to live up to such a title as 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' did.'Comparisons' is the only section of subject matter where I allow myself to be negative here though; forget about what came before this and you still have a fantastic film. It doesn't have any of the silver screen brilliance that Nolan's previous two efforts had, but hey, there's always going to be a worst in a series. The casting was fine as usual, which allowed for some tremendous, heart-felt acting from series regulars Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. Also in the spotlight here were Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy who played 'Bane', the barbaric and brilliant antagonist who shone but more-so adequately rather than amazingly. Design, costume, make-up and visuals workers also need to be praised here for living up to the expectations of a movie based around eye- grabbing scenery and appearances.The editing, production values, sound editing and musical score were also present and polished, with the franchise's familiar themes being thrown towards our ears when necessary, making for a great, well- produced super hero epic.'The Dark Knight Rises' stays true to it's genre and reputation; a film of brilliant action-packed moments which manage to overcome the select few bits of tedium. It's an adventure, a drama and an overall fan- pleaser. I recommend it if you're a fan of the series, though if you are...surely you've seen it by now. ****",8,4,9,11 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars
","1977 was the year that kicked off an iconic batch of stories set a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. From the dynamic mind of George Lucas, 'Star Wars' is a monumental piece of sci-fi greatness, in which it is a film that all aspiring sci-fi writers and directors have looked at for inspiration. With a creative plot and characters that only a true imaginative mind could've created, a stage was set for much beloved film trilogy.The casting was great, I don't think anybody could ever imagine the characters introduced in this film being, acting or sounding any different to how they do here. Leading the way is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, closely followed by the other main protagonists Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) which led to a stellar cast allowing their chemistry to grow as the movie went on. Also present and profound were Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker playing droids C-3PO and R2-D2 respectively, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca the wookiee, and David Prowse as Darth Vader, voiced by the legendary James Earl Jones.But enough about the actors, what really makes this movie special are the visuals, graphics and special effects that nobody had so immaculately achieved at this point in time; the TIE fighters scenes and the soaring planetary landscapes must've been so breath-taking, in which case they still are today. Along with excellence in special effects, there is also excellence in original score-writing, in which most will agree that John Williams' best work lies within this movie.Dynamic, creative and at times very funny (mostly because of C-3PO), Star Wars lives as a real innovative turning-point in cinema, though the emphasis on the effects and visuals almost overshadows the fact that this is one of the greatest and most lovable films of all time.",9,1,1,28 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Empire
","Just as cutting edge as the first instalment of this classic and innovative sci-fi series, and just as cinematically compelling. Some would argue that 'Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' is even better than its predecessor, but in most aspects it is merely a strong, steady and solid 'part two' to an epic three-part story.George Lucas still does a powerful job in the sequel, along with the famous addition of Frank Oz's Yoda and a fantastic screenplay/story basis; this is excellent in all marks of what makes a movie great. The regulars are still there, the protagonists and antagonists, making this just as lovable as 'A New Hope', along with the debut of Lando Calrissian and the story-arc and exploration of Hans and Leia.While the entire story is a great work, the film is perhaps most notable for the big scene where it is revealed that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, a scene which has gone on to become both memorable and quotable, along with the awesome moment when the reveal is said by Darth Vader and 'The Imperial March' starts playing.Time has shown that most movie franchises don't produce particularly great sequels, let alone trilogies, but hats off to George Lucas for doing it right with 'Empire', what a classic!",9,0,0,6 April 2013
The Birds," Hitchcock's 'The Birds'
","If you like suspenseful horror/thrillers with elements of drama and humour then you need to see Hitchcock's 1963 classic 'The Birds'. The most cunning mind in the history of cinema shows off his expertise here, so much that the film is just as eerie and chilling when the feathered antagonists aren't on the screen.Just when you think you've got it all figured out, the story presents itself in an even more complicated fashion, making 'The Birds' not only twisted and scary, but also the timeless classic that it still is today. I'd say 'I'm still watching it in 2013' but I don't want to sound like a tool.Maybe it says more about me and my twisted sense of humour, but watching school children get attacked by a mass flock of birds is just so enjoyable, I know it's not very technical of me but I just love it when you see one child lying down, getting repeatedly pecked by a bird. The darkness also continues into the film's ending, as it seems to be at its eeriest when the birds are at their calmest, concluding on a real question mark. (I hope this paragraph didn't make me look like a terrible person, believe me I wouldn't want that to happen in real life)With no real need for an all-out score or soundtrack; this movie is at its scariest when it's at its quietest. Also notable is its formidable cast; including (and introducing) Tippi Hedren who not only served as a fine lead actress, but has also shown us people of the 21st century that socialites were seemingly a big more dignified back then than they are now, not that that's a complete compliment.****",8,0,1,16 April 2013
