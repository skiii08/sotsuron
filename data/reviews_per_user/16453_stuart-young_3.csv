Minority Report," Truly original
","As with everything from the pen of Philip K Dick this is a truly original idea which has been turned into a very good movie. Cruise transcends his usual movie star style and fits well into this movie. Yes there are are a few holes in the plot but this is a movie and if it's the first one you've watched, that can happen but don't let it distract you from a very good (and alarming) idea.The movie is 30mins too long and the last part doesn't add too much to the story which is a shame because the rest of raises a good question about justice/liberty etc.All in all a very good watch independent of the star involvement which cannot outweigh a fantastic idea.",Null,0,0,17 September 2002
Insomnia," excellent viewing
","This is fantastic viewing and although the choice of bad guy is surprising, it works really well however many movies you've seen him in as the good guy. Although we can see (or think we can see) his comic personality below the surface it's amazing how it easily translates to something darkerWe really get a sense of the movie title, we are convinced that it is daytime for 24 hours. Pacino is simply his very excellent self.The ending leaves you thinking which may be a disappointment to some but for me was a perfect ending. Something 'clean' would not have done this justice.",Null,0,0,17 September 2002
The Bourne Identity," Worthwhile viewing
","Lead character doesn't know who he really is is hardly a new storyline but this is still a good way to spend an hour or two Matt Damon is perhaps too young to be really convincing in this role but the movie still keeps your attention, lots of unidentified people filling key roles in the story. Obvious to say since the story is set in Europe but the movie has a very European feel which I haven't seen for a while and it gives the film a certain credibility. Ending is bit lame but is short enough to not ruin the whole story.",Null,0,1,17 September 2002
