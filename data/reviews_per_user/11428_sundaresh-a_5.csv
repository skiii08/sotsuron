Antz," Ants, Bee movie, Conspiracy theories and Aliens
","I was one to dismiss all conspiracy theorists as paranoid and their conspiracy theories themselves as unfounded eyewash, till seeing these two movies confirmed what I long suspected and deep down always expected. All said and done, a crow cannot sing like a cuckoo.Ever come across an ant that made its own meal and not steal it or come across a bee that drank its own nectar. Ever seen a selfish bee or a selfless ant. The only bees I have seen that didn't make any honey were in Bee movie and the only ants I have seen that didn't help themselves but help others were in Antz. It is not for nothing that ants carry more than their own weight. The number one killers on land are African army ants whose war path one had better not cross when they go on a binge or feeding spree. Their scourge is on land what the feeding frenzy of shoal's of vicious fish is on water. On the other hand, all one needs to do to not be stung by a bee is to not disturb it. The Guinness records, Ripley's believe it or not, and such other shows featuring daring human feats are a testament to this fact. One who has to smoke the hive and/or invade it to evict the bee to steal its honey is certainly a thief. I have always maintained that the only one worthy of the silk is the worm that makes it. It is the only thing more precious and more priceless than the silk itself. The only one worthy of the honey is the bee which produces it. It is the only thing more precious than the honey itself. The only one worthy of the nest, is the bird which builds it. It is the only thing more precious than the nest itself. The only one worthy of the web is the spider which spins it. It is the only thing more sinister than the web itself. And here is the good news of the gospel. The only one worthy of the truth is the one who tells it. For being the humble steward and the servant of the truth, and for upholding it, that one is certainly more precious than the truth itself. One can never hope to better the standard by always lowering it, yet always going under it and always falling short of it.Clearly, these movies are directed towards an innocent and infantile audience, readily trusting, easily impressionable, with tremendous grasping power. Do they need to be fed such a lopsided and perverted truth at this young age ? They will take it to heart and passionately consume it and eventually be consumed by it.What is it, if not a conspiracy theory to suggest that one must not eat of the fruit of the tree of good and evil; that to discriminate between good and evil, between right and wrong, is in-fact not good but evil ? What is it if not a deep-seated conspiracy and lie to suggest that being good is neither important nor necessary nor required, to go to heaven, and the criteria for getting to heaven is to just believe in God, not even to believe in being, much less in actually being good ? What is it if not a conspiracy to suggest that God can forgive all the banalities and sins of the evil people and welcome them into his heaven, but cannot forgive the one sin of the good people of not believing in him ? What was eden, if not a garden and I am sure that it was not a lawn, or a portico, or a terrace, or a hanging, or a bonsai, garden ? What did the Lord and the son refer to himself as, but the true-vine and refer to his father as, but the gardener ? In all my life I have never come across a dead vegetable or a live wire. I have never tasted junk and unhealthy food, or swallowed nutritious and healthy medicine. There are no such things. What is it if not an out and out seditious and subversive conspiracy theory to suggest that a little evil is good but a lot of good is evil; that a little poison makes it elixir and a lot of elixir makes it poison, upon which a malicious system of medicine is founded ? Just how much poison in solid food will actually make it better and not contaminate it. What if this contaminant was slyly introduced into the food product as a chemical preservative or as a false nutritive or as an additive of some sort, or into the food cycle itself as a chemical pesticide, or even artificial manure ? Does not a drop of poison in drink make the whole drink poisonous ? The dispersion is least in solids, more rapid in liquids, and a lot more pronounced in gases. What sort of poisonous gases emerge and emanate from the breath of smokers and from the exhaust fumes of vehicles ? That fossil fuel is not even good for the very machine and engine that it drives and will rapidly wear out that engine and deteriorate that contraption. BTW, if you are wondering, where did all this prodigious underground reserves of fuel come from and at the same time are also wondering what happened to all the Dinosaurs, now you know. The plain fact of the matter is that one can never have too much of what is good nor have too little of what is evil.What is it, if not a conspiracy theory to project false values in movies, all of which glamorize and glorify the unjust and the evil, and denigrate the just and the good, these ones included ?Does one have to scope and scout the universe to detect aliens ? Do they not dwell among us ?",1,0,7,18 May 2015
Liar Liar," Is the lawyer(liar) above the law(lie) ?
","Perhaps the answer to this question is also the answer to the pedagogical question of the relationship of god to good ? Is god above being good , or is he the embodiment and the personification if not also the pinnacle and the summit of all that is good ? Now all of us clearly have two nature's, one is our true or our real nature and our genuine personality and the other is our artificial or our feigned or our second nature and our affected personality. There is often a huge be it real or be it illusory discrepancy or gap between who we presume ourselves to be and who in fact we really are. Unfortunately, who we pretend to be, or try to be or pose to be is not who we really are, or even, deep down who we really aspire to be and really want to be. Whether such a worthy or unworthy desire of who we want to be, entertained by us is within the realm of possibility and is in-fact attainable and achievable especially by someone perceived to be as insignificant such as us, and in our situation, in our circumstance, in our plight and in our predicament is another question altogether ? We often project and portray an image of ourselves before the society and before this world which is not who we really are ? We are not honest in our dealings either with ourselves or with others and are prisoners of our own persona and do not tell people what we really think and what we really feel ? Now keeping up this image or facade is too much work, and on top of it, to make matters worse and much more complicated, the society and this world while itself miserably failing, tells us who we ought to be, and expects us to be someone or something that we intrinsically or naturally are not inclined to be or given to be, and do not fancy being, or even care to be. Neither are we outspoken in our opinions nor are we forthright and sincere in our attitudes and in our interactions. Besides apart from the native complex of putting up appearances there is the age old question, should we care for what other people think about us and the opinion they have about us or should we not, and are we in this world to please ourselves and to do our own bidding or are we in this world to please others(this world and this society) and to do others bidding ? Which of these two options is right ? We need to stop creating and to stop believing in myths about ourselves and about our true nature as well as about this world and its true nature, lay down our false ego and burn it for good, not just bury it for later resurrection and reemergence. Is life really a joke and a laughing matter or is it a matter of grave importance ? Is our life really one that is worth living ?",1,0,4,2 June 2019
Ghost Rider," Virtues of the virtual world
","Well, the fiercer the storm, the calmer its eye, unless it is a storm in a tea-cup made by the Ghost Rider. Take a thick yet light rope, of a fair length, in your hand, if not a heavy chain, and try creating a vortex overhead, and once that is done, now try doing the same thing without having the wind knocked out of your lungs.Then you can graduate to doing it by just twirling your wrist, instead of your whole arm; this later feat should be easy since you are using a thick rope, not a thin strip of ribbon, not to mention, you are not a lady dancer.Finally, if you are not using a heavy chain already, migrate to it now.You will have to start all over, but think of it as perks of the job. Admitted, doing all this would be a lot easier, if you were just a dead skeleton, instead of also live flesh and blood. Although, I certainly would not mind burning the road instead of the rubber. Is this a comic-al marvel or a scientific one ? Are these blatant mis-takes and are they cool and are they hot , or are they what-not ? Going by today's trends and taste, I'd say this movie grossed quite a bit, not considering the hearts all over the world it would have set on fire, and the adorable central character no one would mind impersonating.You might say I am making too much of it, movies are pure escapism, not meant for portraying reality and depicting the truth, but I say the thin veil separating fact from fantasy can never be parted, and like it or not , even in the fantasy world, one is bound to fortuitously take sides even if they be the same, and eventually determine to stand one's ground even if it be shaky. Would you rather not do the exact opposite in the factual world ? It is certainly a lot easier, and you will definitely be better off.When retaining ones own sanity is a far cry in a world that prefers insanity, it certainly is too much to ask on my part, perhaps even my own insanity, to expect some semblance of sanity from it.",2,0,1,17 October 2014
Jurassic Park," Thriller
","This movie reminds me of a story in Tinkle Comics of the Amar Chitra Katha series, an old I am assuming fairly popular and well known comic book series in India, that I read as a kid. The story is about four students three of whom are very intelligent, always straight A , and the fourth one is a dunce, always F. Having completed their education, they set out into the world together to try out their prospects and it so happens that on their journey they have to go through a forest where in a clearing they find the skeleton of a dead animal. The three smart students agree this is a good opportunity to apply and to test their knowledge and their skill and put it into practice . One smart one says I can reconstruct all the internal organs for this skeleton, and the second smart one says I can give it external muscle and tissue and skin, and the third smart one says I can give it life. The dunce takes one look at the skeleton and flees and climbs up the tallest tree he can find. So the three perform their feat and raise up the dead animal which turns out to be a lion which devours the three of them. Maybe there could be a message and a moral to this movie similar to the one in the story and movies and stories can be be both entertaining and enlightening at the same time after all.",Null,0,0,16 December 2017
The Island," Marooned
","Like all contentious themes, the theme of this movie is ever old but also ever new. The story-line or script of this movie read like the pages of the medical horror novels by Robin Cook , of the couple that I have read, Fever and perhaps more appropriately Coma or even mindbend. But apart from the chill and the fright it causes, Is there a valid point this movie is trying to make, and is there a relevant message this movie is trying to communicate and to convey, and is there a real warning this movie is trying to sound or is it raising a false alarm ?Pardon my biblical references, but I cannot restrain myself. In scientific circles the genetic make up or the biological signature of an individual is referred to as his DNA. No doubt in this genetic characterization or genetic code as one might prefer to call it, some basic and fundamental characteristics of an individual's genetic make up would be fixed, constant, non-changing and, eternal which would be its smallest component but also its most central and its most critical and its most vital component, which part I would liken after Jesus's resurrection to be the indestructible seed of Christ sanctified and sealed by the holy spirit sown in the heart of every individual.Unfortunately this might also be the hidden or the invisible or the indecipherable part of the individual's genetic make up, for obvious reasons. The rest of the DNA would be the part which serves as the soil for this seed, in other words it would be the part which changes over time, but then the question is how is this transformation or change caused and effected ? Are the character traits manifest and displayed by an individual the result of his DNA, or is the DNA of an individual a characterization and a representation of not just the inherited character traits, but also the acquired as well as the developed and ingrown character traits, be they natural or un-natural as a result of the choices made by the individual himself. This latter point of view, which is the more accurate clearly allows for the existence of free-will and makes moral choice an integral part of the genetic make up of an individual and grants each and every individual total and absolute freedom and control to as they say grow and to develop his own character traits or so to speak to make and to form his own DNA, because choice is always the most crucial factor.Most certainly, it will not be true that the DNA of an individual is what makes that individual, rather the other way around, what an individual has chosen to make of himself is what makes his DNA. A direct consequence of this fact is that artificially and forcefully changing and altering the genetic make up or DNA of an individual may not necessarily bring about the desired change in the character traits of that individual, and even if it does; the change will not be a lasting and a permanent one. For instance if for whatever reasons valid or invalid, an individual unfortunately happens to be an alcoholic and a drug addict thereby given to and prey to all forms of intoxication, no amount of complete blood transfusions or going a step even further no amount of complete, heart, kidney, liver, lung , and every other organ transplants, of the unhealthy individual with those of another healthy individual including those of Jesus himself can change the person and transform the person into a non-addict for good, unless the individual willingly, lovingly and voluntarily, well and truly desires to change and transform himself by choosing to be good soil for the seed of Christ already sown in that person.",1,0,6,3 February 2020
