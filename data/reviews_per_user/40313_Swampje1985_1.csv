The Avengers," Awesome movie!
","I'm usually very excited to watch a superhero movie, but after hitting a couple of really bad ones I kind of lost my faith for an amazing one. I thought of skipping this movie (figured it was overkill to have so many heroes in one film), but good reviews and the fact that it had Joss Whedon's prints all over it tempted me to go see it anyway. And I was not disappointed. In fact, I was amazed!The threat to earth is genuine and the action spectacular. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the fact that it combines serious action with sharp humor seemingly without effort. And it is endearing to see very human flaws in the heroes you've come to love. I felt it was a well-paced movie, where every hero got to shine in their own way. Annnnnd I think Coby Smulders should definitely feature more in movies like this one: honey, that outfit was...ehm well tailored. ;)If you haven't seen this one yet: run (don't walk damnit) to the nearest theatre for an amazingly entertaining 2,5h ride, that'll still leave you yearning for more!",9,2,5,28 April 2012
