The Equalizer," Disappointing, as it appears to totally reverse the original premise.
","Call it something else, anything else. If Matt Damon thinks it inspired the Jason Bourne stories, then he clearly never watched the original series.For Edward Woodward's The Equalizer, violence was always the last resort... he tried first, to do everything possible to expose the miscreant to lawful prosecution or forced retreat through intimidation. One classic line from the original series referred to killing a man as denying him the last opportunity to change. The Equalizer was a man who had seen too much violence, and only sought to protect, not to cause further bloodshed. Yes, it was sometimes necessary, but there were entire episodes where he found a solution that didn't result in gun play and violence.This is simply, one more cheap Hollywood violence fest that undercuts any attempt at moral authority that Hollywood likes to pretend to on violence in our society. I'm glad that Edward Woodward is no longer alive to see the travesty they have made of one of his most memorable screen characters. I like and respect the ability of Denzel Washington, but I will NOT watch one moment of this cheap knockoff of a series that I very much enjoyed.",1,60,128,23 September 2014
Pearl Harbor," #1 Most Historically Inaccurate Movie
","I love WWII movies, I've studied WWII history my whole life. That is exactly why I rate this movie as awful. Because it is. Serious historians continually rank it one of the most inaccurate movies of all time.The list of reasons defy time and space to list, but suffice to say that the basic premise that a fighter pilot with no bomber experience would even be selected to train for as difficult a mission as the Doolittle raid defies belief. This is history for those who actually believe that 'Reality TV' bears any resemblance to reality.Seriously, get your WWII history from books that were written by those who were there, and read from all sides. If interested, I can give you a good starter list. Hollywood rarely gets even close. Better yet, go volunteer at your local VA hospital or clinic while we still have some veterans around to talk to, and ask them!",1,4,6,30 May 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Nothing 'funny' about Manson/Tate.
","I'm old enough to remember the slaughter of the pregnant Sharon Tate by Charles Manson and his depraved cult of followers. This film is emblematic of everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. Trivializing the consequences of a sick and drug-addled mind, glorifying violence and acting with complete insensitivity for the feelings of those who were affected. It would probably be hard for a modern audience to envision someone making a comedy about the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. It's bad enough that the prosecution successfully made a comedy of the trial! Just one more example of why I never want to hear anyone from Hollywood giving the rest of us advice on how to live or how to vote!",1,19,56,27 July 2019
Jaws," USS Indianapolis
","To correct a published review which states that 'at least 90 men died...' from the USS Indianapolis. From Wikipedia: 'At 12:14 a.m. on July 30, 1945, the USS Indianapolis was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the Philippine Sea and sank in 12 minutes. Of 1,196 men on board, approximately 300 went down with the ship. The remainder, about 900 men, were left floating in shark-infested waters with no lifeboats and most with no food or water. The ship was never missed, and by the time the survivors were spotted by accident four days later only 316 men were still alive. ' We must never underestimate the sacrifices of our armed forces.",10,4,8,12 June 2012
