Skyfall," One of the best Bond films every
","I saw the original Bond films in theaters as a child, and loved them all. For me, Sean Connery is the 'real Bond,' and this will always be true. My all-time favorite is From Russia With Love, followed by Goldfinger. I thought Roger Moore was a good choice, but I never liked him as Bond , in part because of the campy presentation of these films. I was very happy to see Daniel Craig as Bond, and I very much enjoyed Casino Royale. After seeing Quantam of Solace, I thought, 'Oh well. Time for a new Bond.' I was more than pleasantly surprised by his performance in Skyfall, as well as the continuation of Judy Dench as M. The acting, writing and direction were masterful. Ralph Fiennes was a terrific choice, and I was happy about the suggestion that we may see him again.Even if you don't like Bond movies, you really should miss this. Truly a masterpiece among action/thriller films.",10,3,11,9 December 2012
