The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard
","The Longest Yard, in my opinion was a very funny movie. It has a great cast such as Adam Sandler and Chris Rock. I hated how poorly the guards treated the convicts, I honestly don't think convicts deserve to be treated like that. I also feel as if Burt Reynalds shouldn't have been in this movie because he was the star in the first version of The Longest Yard. I thought it was cool how they had some of the WWE superstars such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kevin Nash and Goldberg. Also I liked how they had Nelly in this movie. With a cast like that, it makes for a good time and a hole bunch of laughs. Peter Segal did a great job directing and I think Albert Ruddy who planned the storyline did an awesome job at showing how prison can be.",8,0,3,26 September 2005
