Ford v Ferrari," Wow... Ford, Shelby, Iacocca!
",I missed getting to see this in the theater which I wish I had for the sound and experience but I rented it today on Prime and wow this is a great movie! If you grew up loving American muscle cars and cars in general you will love this movie. Legends these guys are! Watch it today!,10,1,3,1 May 2020
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Her sister is an idiot... Katniss is annoying!
","Can Katniss please stop hugging her stupid sister every time she does something completely stupid and detrimental? Doors are closing and the stupid girl runs back up to the sleeping quarters to get the cat because she 'couldn't live with herself' if something happened to the stupid cat in the middle of an air raid!Katniss is extremely weak and pathetic in this part 1... sorry excuse for a leader, crying all the time and thinking emotionally. I couldn't stand her in this one.This Part 1 was very slow and boring... I had a hard time watching this one and not just playing on my phone out of sheer boredom.",5,0,1,26 June 2020
The Impossible," What are these reviewers smoking??
","This was utter garbage of a movie! Aside from a young Tom Holland doing a fairly good job, every one else sucked! Why was Watts face purple the whole movie but not the rest of her body or anyone else's? Ewan McGregor's crying/babbling phone call to his mom was cringeworthy and everyone sitting around him saying 'come on' you can do it... call her back, was just plain stupid! THEN their insurance company of all things send what is basically a private jet to go pick them up to fly them to Singapore for her medical care was laughable! Has anyone every had their insurance company send a private jet to go get them? This was just stupid and insulting! Do yourself a favor and don't watch this garbage!
Oh wait one more thing... Watts has NO English accent, McGregor very little and the kids have it so thick (esp Holland) that they couldn't possibly be related!
Wow this was just dumb. Music was spot on to tell you how to feel so don't worry, you'll know!",2,1,2,6 May 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Loved it... Great 2 hours spent!
","I half expected another crappy movie from Will Ferrell as the last few have unfortunately been pretty bad. I thought this movie was great and very entertaining. It was very well-acted by all and very entertaining. Dan Stevens (Russian) may have been the best character in this whole movie and Rachel McAdams is just beautiful! Overall it was just a fun light-hearted movie that everyone should watch.
The bearded guy in the bar that gets mad and yells 'Ja Ja Ding Dong' at the beginning and end was hilarious...
Thanks for the 2 hours of entertainment Will!",9,1,3,29 June 2020
The Bodyguard," That's not how you kiss!
","Anyone else notice that their kissing appeared to be hot and dramatic but if you look closely, neither of them once opened their mouths! They both just smashed their closed lips together and the film crew did the rest circling around them. Pretty lame actually... I'm assuming Bobby Brown wasn't ok with her kissing someone else!?Anywho, I'm not sure why the reviews for this movie aren't a whole lot higher than they are. This was such an all-around good movie with pretty good acting and great singing. It's been pretty clear that Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston really did have a connection and as the years have gone on it's obvious that he really cared about her. This really is a nice love story. WH was so all around talented. Gone too soon.Watch it! Pay no attention to the haters...",9,0,0,9 April 2020
Unknown," Uhhhh... Wow! Completely Unrealistic
","I know it's been mentioned by others a few times but its unreal all the stupid, unbelievable things the characters did in this movie. You'll spend the whole time watching this movie, saying to yourself 'oh please, who would do something that stupid?' The characters literally did the complete opposite of what most sane, rational people would do in their shoes and we don't have 'super spy assassin' skills! In one scene Neeson and the woman escape 2 assassins coming to kill them in her apt. They kill one of them and run out of the apartment building (it's about 4 stories tall). They get in a taxi and speed off. At this moment the 2nd assassin is in her apartment 4 stories up watching them out a window speed away in the taxi. Mind you, they are in the car and gone and he is 4 stories up in the apartment... next scene they appear to only be a few blocks away and somehow the assassin comes out of nowhere and slams his car into theirs! Come on! He got all the way down 4 stories, into his car and was able to loop around in front of them to t-bone them from the right at an intersection?! Completely implausible... its insulting to our intelligence! That is all, rant over!
Sidenote... January Jones is not an attractive woman nor a good actress!",2,2,5,3 June 2019
Garden State," Keep dreaming Braff!!
","Written, directed and starring Braff who isn't even almost capable of carrying a movie as the lead character! Great thinking though, casting Natalie Portman because paying her is the only way you would ever get to kiss her! Not to mention there is no chemistry at all between you two in this movie! Good God he's boring to watch and boring to look at! It's like he purposely tries to act strange and be the odd man out anytime he's in a group! There is nothing about his strange behavior that would attract a woman. Certainly not one as hot as Portman...My review for this movie... it's slow, boring and just sucks! All these 10 star reviews are straight BS! Only cast, friends or family of the cast would rate this a 10! Or even an 8 or 9 for that matter! Skip this garbage...",2,0,1,20 May 2020
Casino Royale," Eva Green? Really?
","For a James Bond movie they couldn't do better than getting Eva Green to play opposite of Bond? She isn't believable as sexy eye candy for a minute! She's got no body, no curves and doesn't for a minute fit the 'Bond Girl' image.
I found her very annoying and not right for the role they gave her.It's a BOND movie! They can do better than that!",8,0,11,12 May 2020
Da 5 Bloods," What is Spike doing?
","Okay this movie just sucks. The music doesn't match what's going on and there are so many inconsistencies with the flashbacks and age of the people that it is distracting. Come on, Chadwick Boseman is their leader in the flashbacks and he is literally what 20-25 years younger than the next youngest guy in their crew?! I wholeheartedly agree with the message but this was not the way to convey it. Pass on this mess of crap.Could have done without the stabs at the Trump Administration that clearly had nothing to do with Vietnam or anything related to this film! Ok Spike...2 stars for the message...",2,1,5,21 June 2020
