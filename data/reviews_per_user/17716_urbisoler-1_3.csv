Moneyball," Moneyball with ***Spoilers***
","There is a particular reason why I thought this film was absolutely terrific.It is based on a philosophy of statistics called Sabermetrics created by Bill James, that the Oakland A's utilized for the 2002 MLB season after the A's lost 3 key players and were forced to rebuild on a low budget.(It is this statistical analysis that was responsible for my baseball hero, Eddie Yost, being named the best third baseman in the AL for the decade 1950-1959.) It is exciting to see how the stats are introduced in order to build a winning team.There are some problems however. The Assistant GM, Peter Brand,(in real life Paul DePodesta) is the guy responsible for furnishing the GM with the stats that are used to rebuild the team. As the film ends, it is the GM that gets all the credit, not the assistant.Another problem is that we never hear the MGR eat his words since he has been critical of all the changes thruout the film.Nevertheless, this is definitely a film worth seeing.",9,1,4,19 January 2012
The Prestige," Plot Twists ad infinitum
","The word 'discombobulated' comes to mind. I missed a lot of the dialog either thru deafness or the English dialects (or both); there were one (or more) too many flashbacks; but more importantly there were so many plot twists, I suspect that if there are any holes in the plot (which wouldn't surprise me) no one would be able to detect them unless they had a copy of the film and jotted down each fact (or illusion) as it transpires. No fair checking Christopher Priest's novel or the Nolan brother's(?) screenplay. At the end of the film, you ought to at least know how many Borden's and how many Angier's there were (are). And how many died (if any). If someone produces a film with more plot twists than 'Prestige', will that make it a better film? Overkill! No thank you.",5,4,16,23 October 2006
Inside Man," I missed something - maybe a lot!
","Will somebody please tell me why Jodie Foster deserves a fat check for her services? She accomplished nothing. In fact, I fail to understand why the Inside Man bothered to let her in? Curiosity? He told us up front that this was a perfect heist, didn't he? Why would he jeopardize his plan by allowing an unknown quantity in the mix? Presumably, she convinces Chris Plummer that the Inside Dude would eventually collect his ransom at a later date (and not expose Plummmer) but is that the Inside Man's goal? Not clear.The Insider leaves a calling card in Denzel's pocket at the end. Is that to confirm the success of his plan or is he instigating Denzel not to give up the quest for the Insider's long range goal. Jodie looked none to happy when Denzel 'indicated' that he planned on doing just that. Is there a sequel on the drawing board?Any help out there?",Null,0,1,18 August 2006
