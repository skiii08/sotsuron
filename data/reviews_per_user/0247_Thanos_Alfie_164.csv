Radha Mitchell who played as Rose Da Silva made a really nice interpretation and Jodelle Ferland who played as Sharon / Alessa made for one more time a beautiful interpretation.Finally I have to say that 'Silent Hill' combines really well mystery with horror and also represents perfectly the video game.,6,0,0,11 August 2014

","'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is a movie which has to do with a espionage veteran, George Smiley who is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6 during Cold War. In this movie we watch how Cold War was and how difficult was for some people to unravel the toils.I liked this movie because of the plot and the story which have much of suspense and mystery. I also liked it because of the interpretation of Gary Oldman who plays as George Smiley and I think that he made one of his best interpretations in this movie.

Dear John," Don't bother watching it...
","'Dear John' is a Romance - Drama movie in which we watch a US Army Special operations soldier who returned home for a couple of weeks and is going to return back to his base, falling in love with a conservative college student. After they spend these weeks together he leaves and they agree to keep in touch and write to each other. He plans not to sign up again and return back home but 9/11 changes that.I didn't like this movie because it neither had a well-written script nor an interesting plot. The movie failed to cover the plot holes that they were created and it also failed to capture and maintain the interest of the audience. Another thing that I didn't like in this movie was the wrong projection of autism something that I found very irritating. Despite that, I want to say that the interpretation of Channing Tatum who played as John Tyree was good and equally good was the interpretation of Richard Jenkins who played as Mr. Tyree.To sum up, I have to say that 'Dear John' is a bad movie with a poor and boring plot that don't make an effort of maintaining the interest of the audience if there was any. In addition to this, it was considered that projecting a very serious subject like autism it will gain more reputation and more people will go to watch it, something that I find horrible. I don't recommend this movie to anyone and make yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching it.",2,2,2,16 December 2018

I also liked most of the soundtracks of it. Since I had high expectations from this movie and I read many reviews before I watched it, I have to admit that I was disappointed with it but I believe that I would be even more if I wasn't prepared for it. I liked the interpretations of Margot Robbie who played as Harley Quinn, Will Smith who played as Deadshot and Jay Hernandez who played as Diablo. In my opinion, the interpretation of Jared Leto who played as The Joker was poor and I expected more from him.Lastly, I believe that 'Suicide Squad' is an average movie which due to its high promotion and advertisement made the people having very high expectations and of course they were let down by it.

But Doc has a different plan for him due to the fact that Baby is very good at his job and when he tries to get away from this kind of life finds himself and everything he cares for in terrible danger.I liked this movie because it had a good and a very different plot from the other action movies with robbers and drivers. I also have to admit that it combined very well and with a very clever way comedy and drama scenes in order not to make this movie clearly a drama movie but to relieve any tension that might be grown on that scenes. Ansel Elgort who played as Baby was simply outstanding on the role of the driver, I also liked the interpretation of Lily James who played as Debora and Kevin Spacey who played as Doc. The interpretation of Kevin Spacey reminded me his interpretation of the movie '21' of 2008 with Jim Sturgess which I also enjoyed it. The direction of Edgar Wright was an average one but I think that a few more flashbacks or some extended memories of Baby or even some plot twists were needed. In addition to this I have to say that another thing that I did not like, it was some scenes which were not so realistic such us one of the final scenes with Kevin Spacey.To sum up I believe that 'Baby Driver' is a good movie to watch and I am sure that you are going to have a good time.

In order for Superman to become a symbol of hope for all the people and to succeed a lot of obstacles have to be surpassed.I liked this movie even though I was never a fan of Superman because it showed him from a different perspective than all the other movies of Superman or even some series. It has a well-written script, very good visual effects, and cinematography. I also liked the interpretations of Henry Cavill who played as Clark Kent / Kal-El/ Superman, Michael Shannon who played as General Zod and Diane Lane who played as Martha Kent. I expected more from Amy Adams who played as Lois Lane and from Russell Crowe who played as Jor-El. Despite that Zack Snyder for one more time makes an average direction with too much darkness as most of his movies and many flashes of lightning which makes impossible for audience to focus on something. To sum up, I have to say that 'Man of Steel' is a good and interesting movie to watch and have a good time. If you compare this movie after watching it, with 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' which is a $250 million average movie and nothing more, you will find out why 'Man of Steel' is far better than this.

This movie has to do with a teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who moves back in with his parents and he tries to regain his relationship with his ex-wife.I liked in this movie very much the interpretation of Jennifer Lawrence and I believe that she deserved the Oscar for the Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role of 2013. I have to say that I expected more form Bradley Cooper and I believe that he did not give us the 100% of his acting. An another interpretation that I want to mention is Robert De Niro's which I found it just perfect.,7,1,2,27 January 2014
Divergent," Some people are just different...
",'Divergent' is the first Sci-Fi movie of this trilogy and in this movie we watch a world that is divided into factions and each person has to be a part of one. Unfortunately Tris cannot be a part to any of these factions because she is a divergent. Divergents are considered as the most important and dangerous people and have to be eliminated but why?I liked this movie because it has a different kind of plot from other Sci-Fi movies and that's something that made this movie interesting at first. The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect much from 'Divergent' but it was a very nice surprise. This movie made a very good start for this trilogy and I hope to continue like this and even better.,7,2,2,8 February 2016

","'Dreamgirls' is a nice musical movie in which we are back in 1960's where we have a trio of black female soul singers who are trying really hard to succeed. Also we get into their lives and in their relationships.I pretty liked this movie even though I do not like musicals because of the cast and their interpretations. Jamie Foxx who played as Curtis Taylor Junior was for one more time magnificent such Eddie Murphy who played as James 'Thunder' Early was. I liked also the interpretations of Jennifer Hudson (won the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role), about Beyoncé Knowles I have to say that was not as good as I hoped to but it was OK. One more thing that I liked in this movie was the costumes of the actors and of course the music.Finally I have to say that 'Dreamgirls' is a good musical movie and a simple one. If you are a fan of musicals then I believe that you will love it, if you are not then it would be something different but nice.",6,0,0,27 January 2015

Also he had all of his friends trying him to laid even for one time with a woman.I did not like this movie because it was not as I expected it to be and I mean that I wanted to watch and had more information about this man and his life or his previous life (some comebacks were not enough). I also believe that the direction of Judd Apatow was not enough to make this movie just great. Although I have to tell you that the interpretation of Steve Carell who plays as Andy was really nice and also Catherine Keener was great.Lastly I want to tell you that 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is not a bad movie or something like that and do not watch it but the only thing that I want to tell you is to not expect much from this movie.,6,0,1,5 March 2014

There they face many difficulties and they have to cope with the feeling of missing everyone and homesickness.I liked this movie because it was different from the other war movies I have seen although it reminded me in some moments Stanley Kubrick's movie 'Full Metal Jacket' which is a masterpiece. The direction which was made by Sam Mendes was very good and he presented very well the struggles of marines for their hard training to their operations in Gulf War. He also showed the other face of war, the true face of soldiers when they are prepared to go to war and when they are at war. Regrading the interpretations of the movie, Jake Gyllenhaal who played as Anthony Swofford was for one more time simply amazing, Jamie Foxx who played as Staff Sgt.

In addition to this, I have to say that the direction made by Alex Proyas who is also the writer was exceptional and made me feel the agony of our main character on his quest of finding the truth. The interpretation of Rufus Sewell who played as John Murdoch is simply amazing and I believe that it's the best interpretation of him.

Vin Diesel makes a really good interpretation as Dominic Toretto who plays as a street racer. Also good interpretations made in this movie by Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto) who plays as Dominic Toretto's sister and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) who plays as the girlfriend of Dominic Toretto.I liked very much 'The Fast and the Furious' movie because it shows us how is to be in this world of super cars, races, speed and all of that stuff, and makes you also feel all of these one by one.",6,2,5,8 November 2013

Such as Andie MacDowell, Elizabeth Banks and Amber Heard. Unfortunately many people understood that and that was the main reason why this movie was not better than the first.

Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was Renée Zellweger's who played as Dorothy Boyd and she was very good at it. The direction which was made by Cameron Crowe was very interesting and I enjoyed the way he presented the many changes in the life of Jerry Maguire and how he had to fight in order to get back on track and also how this influenced his personal life and the people loved and cared him the most (great character evolution).Finally, I have to say that 'Jerry Maguire' is a nice movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast.

This will have as a result a creation of a dinosaur which is the strongest of them all and is genetically modified from the scientists of the park in order to be able to survive and kill everything.I liked this movie because it had been a lot of time since a dinosaur movie released and it was actually good. It had an interesting plot with some modifications or differences from the original movie of Jurassic Park but the main core of the plot remained the same. I believe that it was a good idea because the director kept the original plot to its core and he built on it his new ideas for this movie and that's why I think Colin Trevorrow did a good job in the direction of this movie. I have to admit that I also liked the interpretation of Chris Pratt who played as Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard who played as Claire. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Irrfan Khan's who played as Masrani and he was also very good because he gave a different touch in some scenes which I believe made the difference and BD Wong's who played as Dr. Henry Wu and he gave the speech of the movie.Finally, I have to say that 'Jurassic World' is a nice movie, it has great interpretations and a well-written script that will draw your attention and I am sure that you are going to like it very much.

It should be noted that it is based on the novel 'Der Vorleser' from Bernhard Schlink.As a conclusion I would like to tell you that I recommend it because I think that it will 'touch' you.,7,1,1,7 August 2013

It has plenty of action, it's an interesting movie with a well-written plot which makes the movie more interesting. In my opinion, it's the best DC movie until now but DC has room for improvement in order to just be compared with Marvel not surpass it because I find it extremely difficult. I liked the interpretation of Gal Gadot who played as Diana and Chris Pine who played as Steve Trevor. Despite that, I have to mention a moment in the movie that I didn't like and I will put it as a general term that would be good for movies with superheroes to be considered before the direction of it. When there is a reveal of a character and there is also a soundtrack behind this, it would be good if the combination of both is or happens the same time and especially in the correct moment in the movie.Finally, I have to admit that 'Wonder Woman' is a good and interesting movie for everyone to watch and I strongly recommend it.

The villagers were really nervous about the arrival of the lawyer and they advised him to leave as soon as possible from the village because they did not want to get in more troubles with this ghost, but he did not listened to them and he continued his work and his investigation about it.I have to say that 'The Woman in Black' is a different movie from other horror movies because it combines really nice thriller and drama with some horror scenes and the whole movie which was filmed in England with all of these nice buildings confer some new and nice things in this movie. I also think that the interpretation of Daniel Radcliffe who plays as Arthur Kipps a young lawyer was simply outstanding. Another nice thing in this movie was the storyline and how this affect the other people lives and how those people felt and did about it. Although I have to say that most of the movie was too dark for me and that was something that I did not like.

Mother!," Don't expect much...
","'Mother!' is a mystery - drama movie in which we watch a couple who has a quiet life, living in a secluded grand mansion that was burned to the ground and they are trying to rebuilt it. Their quiet life and their safe environment comes to disturb some uninvited guests who arrive at their home. And time by time this increases and continues to grow. The more chaos the husband lets in their home the better for him and his ego.At first I liked the movie but after the middle it becomes boring because it tries to much to prepare you for something extraordinary that it's going to happen and finally disappoints you. The plot is not something that even worth mentioning because in its core is very good but on the outer place of it, it's not equally good. Despite the good interpretations of Jennifer Lawrence who plays the mother and Javier Bardem who plays the husband who are the main actors, the supporting roles of Ed Harris who plays as the man and Michelle Pfeiffer who plays as his wife don't help the main characters to evolve. The direction of Darren Aronofsky is below average and of course worse than I expected, that's maybe a result of low budget.Finally I believe that 'Mother!' is an average movie which was promoted so much for no reason. The most disappointing part of this movie is that it has four very famous actors but does not impress the audience. The only reason I rated this movie with five stars is because of these actors and the interpretations of Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. If you want to watch this movie just don't expect much from it.",5,1,2,27 February 2018

The public let Batman attack Superman and at the same time, Superman tries to understand and find out the truth about Lex Luthor who is a millionaire criminal mastermind and wants to fight Superman for his own reasons.I expected more from this movie as most people did. In this movie, there are too many galas that make the audience be bored by it and so, much action. I liked the fight between the two characters which wasn't something extraordinary but it was a decent fight and nothing more. I liked the interpretation of Ben Affleck who played as Bruce Wayne / Batman and I have to admit that I was very cautious regarding the change of the actor of Batman from Christian Bale to Ben Affleck and I was surprised that Ben Affleck was very good at it. I liked also the interpretations of Henry Cavill who played as Clark Kent / Superman and Gal Gadot who played as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman. I didn't like the interpretations of Amy Adams who played as Lois Lane and Jesse Eisenberg who played as Lex Luthor. Zack Snyder makes an average direction with too much darkness as most of his movies and many lightnings. To sum up, I have to say that 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is a $250 million average movie and nothing more. It's a movie just to spend two and a half hours and if you have high expectations or hopes about it then it would be good to reduce them because otherwise, you are going to be disappointed by it.",5,0,3,6 March 2018

I also liked the interpretation of Rebecca Hall (Vicky) who I believe was the best in this movie and had the most difficult part because we watch her emotions change and this was the most difficult part that had to do in this movie. The only interpretation that I can compare it is the interpretation of Penélope Cruz who was really great on his part. About the interpretation of Javier Bardem who played as Juan Antonio I have to say that I did not expect anything less than this, he was great for one more time. Scarlett Johansson who played as (Cristina) was equally good but not as good as Rebecca Hall.Finally I have to say that 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a nice Romance movie which is nice to watch but do not expect much messages to think of after this.",6,0,1,28 January 2015
