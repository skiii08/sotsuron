The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie ever
","To start off with the acting is awful, i don't care if it is low budget itis awful. They don't sound scared or confused at all. There is no point tothe movie, they just wander about the forest for an hour odd. the ending, well what on earth was that? You end up not knowing what has happened, who or what got them or if it was a joke. Whta mianly bothers me is people said it was the scariest movie ever, well what part was supposed to be scary. I was bored throughout, and i didn't see a part in which i thought people would be scared. Avoid this movie at all cost, if someone gives you the DVD as a present then slap them around the face with the box and tell them you never want to see them again.",1,10,18,4 September 2004
Troy," Absolutely pathetic
","Only the Americans could change one of the most famous myths on this planet. The gods are completely ignored, how on Earth can you ignore them, they are the reason it takes place. The contest, in which Paris is the judge, between the Godesses to see who is the most beautiful is the cause of Helen leaving Menelaus after she is used as a bribe. They then take a ten year war and make it as if the war only lasted a few weeks, absolutely pathetic. What made the war so spectacular is the fact that it lasted ten years. Then the ending is changed as Helen escapes going back to Menelaus, when in fact she does go back to Menelaus, all the women of troy go to various warriors. The casting is pretty poor but then again this movie is aimed at idiots and they will like seeing no talent big names in a movie. Those who watch this and enjoy it are morons, they really are.",1,2,9,28 December 2005
