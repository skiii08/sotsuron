The Sound of Music," A truely brilliant film!
","This is a film I have watched many, many times and never tire of. The songs are of the highest quality and can be sung along too at will. It is an uplifting story which always leaves you with a smile on your face at the end of it. Enjoy!",10,3,10,20 April 2003
Lost in Translation," A truely excellent film
","I have now seen this film twice and it is wonderful. The story of two people thrown together out of a need to be understood , and loved. Both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannsen sparkle in the lead roles. And how wonderful it is to have an actress in the lead that does not look like a twiglet. Hurrah!",10,1,2,8 February 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Dire, swearing and no plot
","This is a dire film. There is swearing all the way through, and violence for violence sake. Not once does it add to the plot.There again, there is no plot - it is just awful... Do not watch it - there are no redeeming features at all.......",1,10,24,23 April 2003
