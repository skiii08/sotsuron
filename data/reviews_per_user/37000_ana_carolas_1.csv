The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not bad at all!
","First of all let me say that I'm a fan of the books. I enjoyed the theme and the story itself. So, when I saw the movies I was already prepared for the lame dialogues, specially between Bella and Edward. Even with these lame moments I must say I enjoyed this last movie. It portrays really well what happens in the book and it didn't disappoint me. Regarding the acting, I thought Kristen Stewart finally delivered a convincing performance. I think this is a movie that only fans will like and only they will appreciate the time that was given to portray the evolution in the relationship between the characters. When the movie ended it left me with the desire to see the last one soon which, in my opinion, means that it was not a bad movie at all!",6,0,6,29 December 2011
