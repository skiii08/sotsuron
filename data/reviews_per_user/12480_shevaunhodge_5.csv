The Hangover," one of my favourite comedies
","I found this film very funny and in 2009 it was very different to any film i had seen in a while. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes, so im glad i watched it at a mates house ha!! I still remember some of the famous quotes from the original film 'so long g## boys' 'hey!! she is a nice lady!!' 'you gonna f###on me?' However, when something is good they tend to ruin it by making too much of a good thing to make money. I found the second one funny, but it didnt suprise me as much as the first one because they used the same scenario, having a such a hang over that you dont remember anything, and haveing a person missing that you have to find. The thrird one was funny but you could kind of tell that it was purely a film that had be created to make money rather than an originall film for veiwers enjoyment.",10,1,1,26 February 2019
Superbad," ha just ha!!
","I have to admit that I didn't really want to watch this film back in 2007/2008. I remember my brother saying I should watch it and the title of the film didn't really intrigue me but i thought i would give it a go, and glad I did. The film plot is very simple, and some could sat stupid or silly, but i feel this film is good because the plot is simple. I personally have to be in the right mood to watch a film that requires a good amount of concentration and lots of questioning. A simple story is often good. The films jokes are kind of like' Teen humor', but it it done in a way that is funny to all. I also enjoy the fact that they rip into the police/cops, and he mclovin scene in the shop is my favorite scene in the whole of the film. watch it you wont be disappointed.",10,3,4,13 May 2019
Notting Hill," British films are the best
","Such a heart warming film. Yes the story line is cheesy, but you end up loving it. This is probably because Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are so talented and pull of their rolls so well . They also have two other very famous actors that are brilliant. These people being Emma Chamber and Rys Ifan. Also, from what I can read on google most of the other actors are very famous and talented also which probably also adds the how good the film is. The meaning behind the story is that just because someone is famous doesn't mean they are not normal like everyone else. Like Anna Scott states in the film, she says something like 'The whole fame thing is fake really. I'm just a girl who likes a boy'. This film will send a much needed message to young people these days that famous people are just normal people and are no different to anybody else. Yes there are benefits to being famous making lots of money, meeting other famous people, doing all the things you dreamed of. However, the down falls can have dramatic effects on the person. I mean if you were famous you could't just go out for a casual stroll with your hair a mess and no makeup on because you would probably end up with your face plastered all over some silly magazine and this film highlights this. This film is heart warming with also a good humor all the way through. You must see it.",10,8,8,5 April 2019
The Hangover Part II," good for a 'second film'
","I enjoyed this film. It had lots of funny jokes like the first one, but obviously it did't have the suprise factor like the fist one did. The plot was the same, being so hung over that you cant remember anything, and then having to find the missing friend, but for a film that was probably made purely for money purposes, i enjoyed it. All though, these days, they always have to 'milk' a good things and produce a third film. Why not just leave something be and end on a high note?",8,2,3,27 February 2019
The Sixth Sense," Very clever film
","This film is very different and gives you a spooky ,but unusual feeling all the way through.. The film grips you the whole way through because the story is so interesting, i mean who wouldn't want to know what it would be like to see the dead? 
 The acting is superb especially by Haley Joal Osment who plays Cole Sear. Such amazing acting from someone so young. Fantastic acting, as predicted from Bruce Willis, who plays doctor Malcolm Crowe, and also from Toni collette Lynn sear. 
The story grips you and as the story unfolds, it surprises you quite few times with a lot of moments that leave in in shock. 
The most shocking part of the film is the ending and I don't know anyone that saw it coming. It is defiantly a massive twist that know one would ever guess. There are clues of in the film leading up to the twist, but they are not something most people would spot. The clues are shown in the film, and it is a moment when you say to yourself 'oh I get it now'. 
This film is still enjoyable even if you know the ending so i would watch it anyway, but obviously it is more of a shock if you do not know.",10,1,1,4 July 2018
