The Hangover," One of the funniest comedies since SUPERBAD!!!!
","I had to admit that I was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie, I'm not a big Todd Phillips fan and Road Trip and Old School were slightly disappointing to me in the light that I thought they could be way more dirtier.This movie proved to me that Todd Phillips was holding back for a reason: This movie contains some of the funniest comedic scenes you will ever see on-camera. Most notably is Zach Galifianakis, who pretty much owned every scene in this movie with his awkwardness and witty dialogue. Another great newcomer is Bradley Cooper from 'Wedding Crashers' who did a great job leading the rest of the cast. I'm pretty sure that those two have a big career laid out for them after this movie.The movie contained so many great comedic moments and hilarity that I found it hard to keep still in theaters, I noticed a few other people sitting next to me with the same problem.All in all, a great comedy not to be missed, you'll love the baby, you'll love the tiger and you'll love Mike Tyson. This is a hangover you'll definitely enjoy over and over.8/10",8,2,4,12 June 2009
Superbad," Seth Rogan & Evan Goldberg are geniuses!
","Without a doubt, Superbad is one of the best movies ever made, period! And considering that this movie was written by 2 13 year old kids years ago, that's saying a lot.I honestly could not stop laughing while watching this movie, the jokes were all raw and original, and the acting was superb, and the movie never got boring! I can honestly recommend every teenager that enjoys high school comedies to go see this movie. It makes American Pie look like a preschool film! The only negative thing I can say about this film is that it is not one that parents might enjoy, and is not exactly what parents might call 'healthy entertainment'. But who cares? The movie is funny hands down, Seth Rogan & Evan Goldberg deserve an Academy award for best original screenplay next year. When I came home from watching this movie, I was still laughing, and so hyped up. My parents asked me, 'Are you drunk, are you high?'. I just replied,'No, I'm Superbad.'",10,1,4,25 October 2007
Burn After Reading," The Coen's brothers in their prime!
","Without a doubt, Burn After Reading is one of the best movies The Coen Brothers have ever made. I say one of the best because it's hard to compare an out of control serious comedy like this, to something like No Country for Old Men.The film is brilliant in every single aspect: the story, the characters, the actors, everything! Especially for those that haven't seen something like this before: it's so worth it! On one hand you have George Clooney taking his acting skills to whole new areas especially after he just made some awesome movies like Syrannia, Michael Clayton, and Leatherheads, Frances Mcdormand playing a total pessimist, John Malkovitch stealing every scene simply by his reactions to everything,he kind of reminded me of the character 'Seth' from Superbad, only way older, smarter, and a bit thinner. Tilda Swinton's right where she should be playing the 'cold-hard bitch', much like her recent roles in Narnia and Clayton. And Brad Pitt, whose role in the movie made me laugh almost every second he was on screen, it was something he's never done before, but that's what made it so perfect! Above all, the movie is almost flawless, it's kind of hard to find a perfect comedy out there, but this one had almost everything work out for it. Whether or not you like the Coen brothers, or even if you didn't like No Country for Old Men, Burn After Reading is the perfect comedy for those that truly believe:, 'Intelligence is relative'. Good job Joel and Ethan! 10/10",9,1,5,11 September 2008
