Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," WTF? How did this movie get this much points! Totally Overrated!
","I love IMDb.com !! In 99,9% the points that a movie gets here, are correct depending on the type of movie off course. But what the hell happened with Borat? A friend of me wanted to see this movie and with what I read, I thought 'Ok, let's go for it'. What I didn't look for is who that have written already some comments on this movie. It was the first week that it has opened in Belgium (and Europe?) and most of the comments where from the U S and A. I'm glad to see that there are now already a few other American comments...I understand that some kind of comedy is special/typical and that a few people like it and an other few people don't like it, just like that a few people like or don't like British humor or the American Pie movies but common'... BORAT is NOT funny and will never be funny. I don't understand that this kind of silly *look-at-me-I-want-to-be-a-adored* comedy is funny for so much people... Because of this, I think that the global warming of the planet seems not to be the worst problem in this Universe...Still, to end with a positive point, thumbs up for Sacha Baron Cohen! Even though this movie is silly in my opinion, he plays Borat in a fantastic way!",1,9,19,23 December 2006
