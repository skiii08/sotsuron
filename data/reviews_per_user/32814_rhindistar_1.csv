Airlift," Airlift movie review: Akshay Kumar film is well executed and well-acted
","Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has  certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby,  Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial  masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single  blow and typical song-dance routine Â– Raja Menon's Airlift will give  you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.  Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played  by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air  India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided  the country.  From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah  Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even  recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people  are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning  especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding  Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives  you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on  the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip  side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But  brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding.  Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are  fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The  soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the  viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.  It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing  something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving  back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is  Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and  now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of 'Mera Bharat  Mahaan' actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing  of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic  subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect  thriller  Overall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is  going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5",10,56,75,22 January 2016
