Casablanca," great cast, dull story
","Casablanca is one of those movies which was blessed with a great cast.  I strongly suspect that most people who love this movie love it because they're fans of Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and others, NOT because the story is so good or the script is so exciting.  Good acting can overcome a lot of faults in the script, and the cast is what makes Casablanca such an enduring classic.",Null,1,1,9 August 2000
