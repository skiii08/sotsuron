The King's Speech," An absolute joy!
","A large number of period dramas, especially those centring on royalty, have achieved great artistic and financial success in the history of movies. Their attributed points of content typically include the stylish visual essence of the relevant era, the seething corruption and injustice present, and the influence of a wise and regal protagonist. This year's The King's Speech is certainly one of the finest of the genre, right up there with the magnificent Elizabeth, and its inclusion of the three aforementioned classic elements is incontestable, yet they fall second place to a wonderfully poignant tale of inhibition and liberation.England's pitifully inarticulate and introverted Prince Albert (Colin Firth) is edging ever close to the dreaded, burdensome throne in the uneasy years between the two World Wars. An imposing government, an expectant public, and an unsettlingly coarse father (Michael Gambon, playing King George V for the second time) surround, hitting him with an avalanche of worries and doubts that continue to aggravate his heavily troublesome stammer, which makes all radio speeches an embarrassing nightmare. After years of problems, his always caring and sympathetic wife (Helena Bonham Carter, perfectly charming here as usual) assigns the highly-regarded experimental speech therapist Lionel Logue (a deliciously quirky and also affecting Geoffrey Rush) to this difficult case. For the hapless 'Bertie', sessions are met with considerable reluctance, Lionel's personal questions are received with anger, and heated discussions often lead to the patient's frustrated withdrawal, though he always returns eventually and never ventures too far from a burning desire to be heard without condescension.Here we do see Nazism, royal troubles, and elegant costumes and set design, but they are merely superficial plot lines that serve the heartrending journey of Bertie, later known as King George VI, which lies at its beautiful core. True as it may be that there are perhaps some sappy and unimpressively conventional episodes placed throughout the story, we accept all such events because the stark unfaltering realism of its characters is always there to reinforce the piece. Firth magnificently and touchingly captures the internal rage and maddening fragility of those who are outwardly inept and therefore rarely taken seriously. Rush makes an absolute masterpiece of his role, pumping every line and indeed every second of screen time with glorious intricate characterization. In the acting department, we even have the pleasure of seeing Guy Pearce, Derek Jacobi and Timothy Spall among others in the supporting cast.All in all, one cannot view this film without praising it enthusiastically: it is truly marvellous.",9,0,1,30 December 2010
Black Swan," I survived it! and LOVED it!
","Director Darren Aronofsky follows up his previous hit The Wrestler (2008) with another portrait of a troubled individual consumed by their taxing vocation – in this case ballet – that has also stirred and bedazzled the movie going public upon and well after its release, though of course Black Swan should be thought of as an entirely separate creation. It tells the story of sweet young Nina, a fiercely dedicated dancer who is determined to attain and successfully execute the lead part in her company's production of the well-known Swan Lake. It is a dual role, involving the characters of both the pure, kind-hearted White Swan as well as her vindictive, seductive twin the Black Swan. The former is for her a perfect fit, her being perfectly apt to do the steps correctly and having a natural innocence to give the right feeling to her dancing, but in attempts to embody the story's mischievous antagonists she always comes across as rigid. After quite a messy kafuffle, the eccentric lead choreographer ends up giving her the part despite her difficulty with the latter aspect, as he is convinced that some way may be found to awaken her darker side.The plot, and indeed the general premise of ballet, do suggest that the film is a simple low-key drama appealing to a mostly female audience, but it is of course more prominently a fearlessly brutal psychological thriller, the intensity and enthrallment of which must be experienced to be believed. However, its aspects horror are, in summary, the details of Nina's turbulent transformation into the Black Swan character. This subject is, while of course very confronting, still quite strictly for the purposes of the show, and depicted always from her point of view, and only to the very closed-minded and hypersensitive will it seem distant and foreign as they are watching it unfold. This feat of Aranofsky's is remarkable, and made all the more effective by a wondrous performance from Natalie Portman in the main role. Her acting achievements are equalled by her beautiful co-star Mila Kunis, who is most spine-chilling and compelling as the fellow ballerina that Nina subconsciously transforms mentally into a neat little embodiment of whatever she needs to acquire or conquer to obtain her goal. Recognition is also deserved of the three other most important members of the cast: Vincent Cassel who does a fine job as Thomas Leroy,the choreographer; Barbara Hershey who plays Nina's mother, a typical matriarch who shares a Principal-Skinner-like relationship with her daughter; and finally Winona Ryder with her very raunchy turn as a miserable retired ballerina past her heyday, who used to be Leroy's 'little princess'.I implore readers to ignore the overreacting cowards who say this film is artlessly disgusting, and rush to enjoy this extraordinary convergence of horror and character drama.",9,0,2,13 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Look out for Richard Griffiths' and Judi Dench's cameos, and stay til the end of the credits!
","With this fourth addition to the magnificent Pirates of the Caribbean series, passionate fans have seen a feeble rumour become a fully-fledged exhilarating reality. Whilst it may lack the solid and purposeful storytelling bravado of the earlier sequels, it is nevertheless a satisfying fourth helping of the irresistible Pirates spirit. What's more, the film succeeds in being a faithful continuation of this spirit without merely rehashing its successful predecessors. Plenty of new characters and plot lines are introduced, so much so that it greatly outweighs the old material, yet in the grand scheme of things this approach seems to work, taking this sequel as far away from redundancy as it could possibly go.The story apparently picks up some time after the comical ending of the breathtaking At World's End (2007) at which time 'Captain' Jack Sparrow (the brilliant Johnny Depp) has been travelling freely and solitarily for quite some time, and has now crossed paths once again with his old friend Gibbs (winsomely played by Kevin McNally) who finds himself in a very desperate situation. Jack's very erratically conducted rescue delivers some highly entertaining scenes of wacky dialogue and involving action sequences, displaying the filmmakers' expert utilisation of the winning technique used by many such comedy-adventure films, like Indiana Jones, in which a high-speed early subplot paves the way for the main events. After the incident, the two friends are divided by the intervention of some old acquaintances and the growing interest in chasing the myth of the legendary Fountain of Youth mentioned recurringly in the third instalment. Gibbs, in order to avoid the gallows, is forced into joining Captain Barbossa, (a sublime Geoffrey Rush is the only other returning member of the old cast) who has now humorously become an agent of his master's navy and since the sinking of the Black Pearl has been hobbling around with a peg leg. As for Jack, beautiful plucky Angelica (a sensational Penélope Cruz), one of the many hateful dames from his past, has gotten the better of him. He has been kidnapped and dragged aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by the infamous Blackbeard (a deliciously wicked Ian McShane) who as it turns out is Anjelica's long lost father. Both captains are headed for the Fountain of Youth with different yet undeniably intermingled motives. To reveal them here, prematurely, would rob future audiences of their enjoyment.However, it would not be too harmful to say that, as with Jack's enigmatic intentions in the earlier films, these mysteries are deeply embroiled in the supernatural. Indeed, On Stranger Tides is just as excited about displaying new specimens of eerily psychedelic mysticism as Dead Man's Chest was five years earlier. Blackbeard is a semi-undead being with the satanic powers of magically manipulating a ship as though it were a living, breathing monster, making the ropes and the boards trap and strangle those on board, as well as forcing a raging burst of flames to erupt from the keel. He has many other instruments of sorcery at hid fingertips, but even he appears to be shaken by the viciously seductive, murderous mermaids that the crew must confront in order to reach the fountain. Another force that seems to be intimidating the fiendish brute is the Spanish, who have also joined the hunt, but whose aim appears to be the eradication of such heretical entities as the fountain and Blackbeard. In fact, we soon realise that Blackbeard is no fearsome, formidable tyrant, but a lazy characterless coward who would be nothing without his box of magic tricks. In this way, he is very similar to Lord Beckett from the second and third films, only without the sense of class and the sheer smugness.Reflecting on the series as a whole, one does notice that much of the dramatic weight has been dropped by the time this most recent instalment is reached. However, it is doubtful that any more genuine pathos could have been mustered for the fourth chapter, and the new director, Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) has wisely not been too heavy- handed with the obvious cinematic strategies employed. The sweet blossoming of young love between a faithful Christian (Sam Claflin) and a more sympathetic mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) can be seen a mile away before it is finally acknowledged, but nevertheless it manages to win over the audience, and is quite reminiscent of the initial romantic sparks that flew between Will and Elizabeth throughout The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) before that chemistry lost its flavour. The purely lighthearted line of attack works perfectly, and this allows the splendid fantastical action sequences, as well as the other characteristic aspects, to be executed perfectly. This film is what it is and never pretends to be anything else. Fans will no doubt find it thrilling and refreshing, and as for those who don't share in the Pirates fever, one does wonder why they have still been following the series after eight years.",7,0,1,11 June 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A more than decent sequel to a ripper of an original
","The last couple of years have given moviegoers a mixed bag of modernised Hollywood revivals of classic franchises: some pleasing hits – The Adventures of Tintin, The Muppets – and quite a few ill-received misses – The Smurfs, Alvin and the Chipmunks. So it is a pleasure to kick of the year with a fine sequel to what is perhaps the most successful of these adaptations, along with Steven Moffatt's inspired BBC television series Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Old- fashioned slick and smart plot developments and the traditional period English setting are skilfully blended in with the high-tail action scenes of today's summer blockbusters. Its appeal to both laidback and serious cinema audiences will surely continue to generate the promising commercial success that it has been enjoying thus far. On this outing, the novel mysticism of the menacing Lord Blackwood has been left behind, and the old eroticism of the slippery Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is present only briefly as more elements of the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are introduced. Stephen Fry makes a delightful entrance into the series as the irrepressible detective's brother Mycroft. Usually there is an awkward rivalry between the two, where Holmes is frustrated by his brother possessing superior intellect and wasting it with his laziness, but here they are mostly very co-operative allies. The villain of the piece is a very familiar figure, the unbeatable Professor James Moriarty, but he has also changed. While in this film, as always, he is described as being faceless and consistently elusive, his pompous countenance is revealed within the first half hour. What's more, Jared Harris doesn't play him with nearly as much wicked relish as his predecessors; Guy Ritchie doesn't seem to want us to view him as a diabolical mastermind, but more a neat personification of the inevitable corruption and conflict present in modern society.However, the overall film is far from dulled down and certainly not as restrained as might be suggested from those aforementioned characterisations. The outlandish escapism is partly given in by the spectacularly gripping and often humorous action sequences. Chaotic explosions certainly abound, against a variety of backdrops, including a stirring performance of Mozart's famed opera Don Giovanni and an exhilarating chase through the woods that has spiky wood splinters zooming in every direction. Early on, there is also the classic comical assassin evasion, involving the enigmatic gypsy Madame Simza (Noomi Rampace from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). The other half is of course given by Robert Downey Jr.'s reprisal of another typically erratic role, but this is one of his better excursions of eccentricity. Jude law puts in some fine work also as Holmes' much more sensible and long-suffering roommate and associate Dr John Watson, who exhibits a deeper maturity as he prepares seriously for a marriage to his equally sober girlfriend (Geraldine James).Much lighter this time, yet filled with a stronger sense of doom and danger than the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows might not bring anything terribly new to the table, but it presents its familiar yet reliable products with fine gusto, and aptly manages to keep its audience engaged and energised throughout its sizeable two hour duration, a time that can be treacherously difficult to sustain interest with.",7,0,0,10 January 2012
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Much more than you might expect
","This year's undoubtedly greatest and most noteworthy 'teen movie', Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is a terrific example of the triumph of pure, uncompromised artistic integrity and fearless exploration of dark, deep, unconventional, and not necessarily marketable themes and characters. It's only resemblance to the typical slothful cash cows that are fed to bored adolescents through the Hollywood production line is the timing and screen time allocation of the usual exposition, positive change in circumstances, complication, and transitional pathos leading to a more upbeat resolution. Here, every single rung of the narrative ladder is laden with solid, challenging, meaningful material that remains sturdy during each tonal shift between comedic and tragic.Taking total control of an adaptation of his own book as both screenwriter and director, Chbosky very maturely probes both the social dynamics of the Wallflowers, a group of close high school friends whose interests lie across the broad range of areas other than football, supermodels and pop music, and the incredibly painful life of it's incredibly likable, oddball protagonist, Charlie (Logan Lerman). The Indie, eccentric wallflower gang, the real life equivalent of the Hollywood 'nerds', who more of us are or have been a part of than one might expected are depicted with a very endearing realism that celebrates their alternative coolness. The two members who are most featured, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), proudly parade into Charlie's initially lonely life as a battered, frightened, intensely introverted, humbly intelligent freshman who expresses himself in letters to a friend who is non-existent and featureless, but feels he ought to have. They touchingly take them under his wing exerting an air of confident weirdness, despite their own deep- seated insecurities that might not be as troubling as Charlie's very unsettling issues with insanity, but present just as many problems. Chbosky and Lerman make Charlie, the sweetest, kindest, most sensitive and convincing shy underdog ever to open a film with snarky complaints about one's high school days, and because of Chbosky's very mature approach to crafting this story, his maddening torment from the many guilt-ridden tragedies of his past are instantly understood, and only endear us more to him. The same goes for Patrick, who is quickly revealed to be a closet homosexual desperately trying to quench his thirst in a half-hearted affair with a two-faced jock (budding heartthrob Johnny Simmons) who fears his father's homophobic rage, but still derives primal pleasure from their secret sessions.Despite initially seeming incredibly self-confident with his effortless witticisms and relaxed banter with friends and Sam, his new step-sister, Patrick is soon revealed to be as internally unsteady as Charlie is internally intelligent. Charlie purposely quietens his impressive intellect at school in fear of some surprisingly realistic bullies, so his savvy and pleasingly unsentimental English teacher, Mr Anderson (Paul Rudd), discreetly slips him a string of extra novels to satisfy his voracious literary appetite.This student-teacher relationship and all other potentially cloying aspects of the story are handled with much more subtlety and restraint than I'm sure many audience members will be respecting. Make no mistake, this is a quirky piece, but certainly not cute and 'heartwarming' in the usual. It doesn't try to charm you with sickly sweet sentiment that is supposed to 'grow on you.' Instead, it's strategy is to bombard its audience with themes and events that are crippling harsh and confronting, but must be faced as a fact of life, and then allows us some relief by showing the lighter sides of these characters' lives, as well as the majestic beauty of the darkness residing in them.I do fear that, perhaps, its publicity will deter an audience that will truly appreciate it. Many of those who seek it out are likely to be after an upbeat Indie teenage comedy like Jason Reitman's Juno (2007) and the surprise of a decidedly downbeat drama may not necessarily be well-received. During an intelligently-crafted scene between Charlie and Sam where the subject of love – that is, love in the real world, not in the minds of Hollywood producers – is delicately discussed as the two of them are currently locked separately in uncomfortable, third-rate romantic relationships, Charlie repeats a piece of resounding wisdom he has learned from Mr Andrews: 'sometimes we accept for the love we think we deserve.' It is an ingenious quote that relates to the plights of so many characters, yet, near the time it was uttered, the girl sitting next to me in the theatre muttered, 'Just f--king kiss already!' I certainly hope those slightly saccharine posters aren't the product of the producers' lack of commercial confidence in this quality film, and that they haven't accepted the shallow of love of immature people like the person who was sitting beside me, instead of the full appreciation of art-house audiences.I also hope that the previous work of its three stars, whose names have been generously given marquee acknowledgement, will not create too many misgivings or preconceptions, for all of them produce characterisations that are markedly different from those they may have been previously affiliated with. Emma Watson's new haircut, impressive American accent and much more mature manner successfully remove the Sam from Hermione Granger. Ezra Miller is just as intensely engaging here as he was in We Need to Talk About Kevin, but certainly not psychopathic and demonic. Most of all, Logan Lerman is much more raw, affecting and unassuming than his likable but very typical turn as Percy Jackson in 2010. The rest of the cast, most prominently Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh as Charlie's parents, Nina Dobrev as his sister and Mae Whitman as the sweet but insufferable girlfriend he's too nice to get rid of. Believe me when I say that this a must-see for anyone Charlie's age (15) or older.",9,2,4,23 December 2012
Skyfall," Great fun
","In this, the 23rd James Bond film, and the third to star the grimy yet regal Daniel Craig as the most truly British bond we've seen, skilfully dramatic director Sam Mendes, who's perhaps best known for the quirkily captivating American Beauty (1999) achieves an impressive balancing act of the old and the new, in various aspects of this refreshingly exciting Bond outing.Veteran 007 screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as newcomer John Logan (Hugo, The Aviator) are fully aware of the contemporary setting of the film. Whilst we're still treated to improbably heightened action sequences, energetic mission briefs, witty, confident one-liners and even a few, but not many, fancy gadgets, the reality that these are fading, old-fashioned ministerial and cinematic methods is well is always at the forefront of every scene. The theatrically psychopathic, but not terribly cartoonish villain merciless attacks the weak spots of Bond's inevitable middle age, M's senility and guilt-ridden blunders, and the unfeeling upheavals of the digital age, with his fierce cunning and his alarming technical abilities. M is here at her most vulnerable, but also her most fiercely determined, in a movie that gives her an uncommonly generous amount of screen time. The magnificent Judi Dench continues to show what a good sport she is, and invests the role with terrific gusto. The spectacularly ruthless actions of the dastardly Silva (an even more invested Javier Bardem, channeling some of the chills of Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men) are make viewing that's all the more intense as both the big-budget orchestrations and the characterisations contribute to the excitement.Two MI agents who are more well-adapted to the digital revolution are also a nice addition: the unapologetically youthful computer whiz now holding the position of Q (Ben Wishaw), and the enigmatic realist, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Feinnes, cheerfully sporting his usual tongue-in- cheek comedic flair). In most long-running franchises, new characters moulded in the latest cinematic style are not appreciated. The prevailing rule imposed by fans is that all new additions must be modelled on characterisations of the period of the series' beginning. However, three breaches of this rule, also counting Silva, have served the writers very well indeed, and all the adherences are at best forgettable, as with Silva's henchmen, and at worst tiresomely predictable. The latter category consisting of one of those dreadfully boring, but perhaps obligatory, femme fatales. As the wimpy Sévérine, French actress Bérénice Marlohe gives a performance as grindingly overblown as the sickeningly ridiculous costume that Jany Temine has designed for her. The writers sleepily go through the motions of making her snobby, then flirtatious, then cocky, then clumsy, then vulnerable, then broken, then needy, then helpless and finally, perhaps, dead – I honestly paid no attention to her fate. She certainly wasn't missed when she vanished without a word. Miss Eve Moneypenny, played by Naomie Harris is a far better creation, propelled by the efforts of a much more winsome and convincing actress. It is truly a wonder how Logan and Mendes, usually masters of measured complexity, have coughed up such a pedestrian characterisation right in the middle of this ripper action flick. Only half an hour ago, they made the ingenious placement of an animated credits sequence of the sort that normally closes a film, but here sufficiently gives the impression we need that a long passage of time has swept by our characters, without forcing the audience to share that boredom. The that it is played over by a song that the beautiful Adele wrote and performed especially for the film makes it all the more enjoyable a diversion.It all amounts to a very enjoyable two hours of entertainment, despite that one little lapse.",7,2,9,17 December 2012
Kung Fu Panda," 'Everybody is kung fu fighting!'
","Prior to its release date this delightfully pleasurable action comedy-adventure from DreamWorks Animation seemed as though it would join the likes of 'Surf's Up' (2007) and 'Chicken Little' (2005) as one of the most average pieces of animated rubbish ever to be shown on the silver screen. And it is for the first ten minutes in which we are first introduced to our hero  the Po (voiced by a hilarious, show-stealing Jack Black.) Po is an under-achieving fat, ravenous, panda born the son of a slightly mad noodle seller (voiced by James Hong) who dreams of being a famous kung fu master. His heroes have always been the amazing furious five  Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie,) Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan,) Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogen,) Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voiced by David Cross) trained by the greatest kung fu teacher in all China, Master Shifu (voiced by the magical Dustin Hoffman.) When it is prophesied by the powerful all-knowing Master Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) that the dark and menacing Tai Lun (voiced by Ian McShane)  a former pupil of Shifu's turned evil when he was denied ownership of the powerful dragon scroll will escape from heavy imprisonment and make the entire Valley of Piece fell his deadly wrath, the great turtle announces that the Dragon Warrior must be proclaimed as he is China's only hope. That noble position is of course seeming accidentally given to none other than Po, who must somehow be trained to fight and defeat the monstrous villain.There the film throws off its predictability and becomes a fun-filled action-packed thrill-ride, leaving us all in a daze at how unbelievably wrong we all were to think that it was just another washout. For DreamWorks, this is a fine achievement and an excellent recovery from 'Shrek the Third' (2007.) What's more, this film  unlike most comedies  doesn't rely on the jokes to give it life. The gags of Kung Fu Panda work as more of a little extra spice to top it all off. What really makes it enjoyable is the engaging story.",7,0,0,1 March 2009
Coraline," Marvellous!
","As incredible as Coraline is, we cannot say it is an 'unexpected delight'. When it became known to us that this film would be based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, the author of Stardust, and that Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas' Henry Selick was going to direct and write the screenplay, we knew we were in for a treat. The voice cast here – which includes Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Keith David and Ian McShane – is superb, and the remarkable originality and creativity that surrounds this wonderful story makes this a serious contender for this year's hotly contested Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.The adventures of feisty young Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning,) the neglected daughter of two dull grocers Charlie (voiced by John Hodgman) and Mel (voiced by Teri Hatcher) begin when she meets the talkative yet friendly Wybie Lovat (voiced by Robert Bailey Jr.) a boy who lives nearby who finds and gives to her a stuffed doll with buttons eyes that look exactly like her. This is the start of a monstrous plot invented by the 'Other mother' (Hatcher again) to spy on Coraline and find the faults in the young girls life, then use this information to create a perfect and intoxicating world to impress Coraline, luring her into it with a mysterious secret door.Regardless of the fact that this is of course a children's film, you'll find that there is genuine tension created by the film's mid-way point. This is not only due to the brilliantly crafted plot, but by the ingenious and meticulous design of the always delightful claymation that possesses a charm, devotion and power that CGI lacks tremendously.Though Selick's direction isn't quite as tight as his screen writing. The script of Coraline contains the same flaws as those of other, similar animated films such as Nightmare Before Christmas and 'Tim Burton's Corpse Bride' (2005) where the overall concept of the narrative is sensational and highly imaginative, but the results of the writers' difficulties in turning it into a story of reasonable length are rather tiring and tedious.",9,0,2,27 September 2009
The Hunger Games," An excellent stand-alone film that doesn't belong in a series
","After last year's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 famously hammered the nail in the coffin of the beloved Potter franchise, many avid teenage readers and moviegoers searched frantically for another dependably exciting adventure series to fill the aching, gaping hole that was left after the worldwide heartbreak. The fact that many of them believe that they've found it with Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games will, it seems, mitigate the power of what is really an inspired, intelligent, brilliantly crafted fable and provide egoistic film critics with the perfect ammunition to blast away the threat to their vain conservatism. This should never have really been a series, because it works on the same level as other eerie futuristic pieces such as George Orwell's fascinating 1984 or Ridley Scott's rickety but well-intentioned Blade Runner (1982). Books or films belonging to a pre-mediated fantasy or science fiction series usually end quite inconclusively and mysteriously, with a neat explanation being provided in the final instalment. This perfectly packaged ending is made possible by the disconnect from the real world, but The Hunger Games is very much focused on harsh realities and palpable, relatable ambiguities, or at least it was until the sequel Catching Fire was published in 2009. The main premise of the story might have been typical of teenage entertainment – yet nevertheless exciting – but the insightful earlier and later passages are what set it apart from mainstream blockbuster entertainment.As most people know, the story centres on young Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who struggles to support her family and to cope personally in a brutal dystopian future. She lives in the last of twelve strictly separated districts that get progressively poorer, although each has been oppressed severely by the Capitol, particularly after the great insurrection that occurred several decades before Katniss' birth. This is where one of the story's most unique aspects comes in, in that the violent and passionate rebellion that usually takes centre stage in these stories has come and gone unsuccessfully, and has had adverse effects on the later generations. Now, every year, the Capitol draws names out of a ballot and takes a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18, gives them a brief bit of training and places them all in an arena in a gruelling fight to the death that becomes a twisted reality television show for the entire population. Katniss volunteers as a tribute after her fragile, 12-year-old sister is called up, along with the humble and kindly Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who is just as convinced that he will lose because of his useless fighting skills as he is that Katniss will win because of her determination and hunting experience, and is eager for them to pose as 'star-crossed lovers' in order to gain publicity and extra assistance from sponsors.What follows is their navigation of a perilous moral, philosophical, physical and emotional minefield whilst they try to find a balance between staying true to themselves and their personal beliefs, even if it means defying the Capitol, and being strategic and adaptable enough to survive. It would be a very laborious task to describe the many details of these rich plot developments, but due mention must go to a few of the most intriguing characters, and the actors that so impressively embody them. Liam Hemsworth effectively plays the supporting character of Gale, Katniss' best friend, who always optimistically insists that they should flee to the forest to live as nature intended and be free of the Capitol. He is just as likable as Peeta, and both are naïve and coldly realistic in their own way. 12- year-old newcomer Amandla Stenberg beautifully captures the innocence and cheekiness of Rue, a gentle but elusive young tribute who is incredibly adept at climbing. Jack Quaid, another newcomer, somehow manages to mask his natural warmth in order to play an insufferably pompous yet undeniably tough and dangerous competitor from the wealthier area of district 1, where tributes are fiercely trained from a young age and volunteer with pleasure to slaughter the poorer citizens. As for Katniss herself, the still unsteady Jennifer Lawrence has proved to be the perfect casting choice. Our heroine is very similar to her Oscar- nominated role in Winter's Bone (2010) and no doubt she's used many of the same characterisation techniques to portray this tough, earthy yet very sympathetic character, but here she has refined her acting skills enough to make the audience like her as well as the Academy. Josh Hutcherson has also been very well cast as Peeta, being very believable and incredibly moving. It is a pleasure to see him still acting well and prominently after his terrific efforts as a child actor in the last decade, and hopefully he will make the transition to serious adult actor. Lenny Kravitz portrays another powerfully sympathetic character, Cinna, the only Capitol official who recognises the cruelty and harshness of the Hunger Games and extends a gentle, helping hand towards Katniss. Indeed, the upper class is a ghastly sight. Respected actors Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones and Elizabeth Banks stagger on screen as outrageously dressed, ridiculously drunk, shamelessly shallow and often shockingly heartless bureaucrats that appear to be caricatures at first glance, but eventually one realises that as far as representations of government officials go they couldn't be more realistic.A story such as this could never have a concrete ending and remain believable, and unfortunately, by giving it an ending across two sequels, Suzanne Collins has ruined this marvellous fable's chances of ever being taken seriously by anyone over the age of twenty. Still, make sure you experience this fantastic book and film.",8,4,12,30 March 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Amazing! A truly unforgettable action thrill-ride!
","This film left a terrible impression on me when I first saw it with perhaps overly high expectations after my splendid experience with the original. My initial opinion was that it had a crazy mixed-up messy incomprehensible storyline, that the superfluous Flying Dutchman scenes were far too violent and disgusting and were most intolerable, and that the action scenes were slow monotonous and dragged on and on without getting the point. Though during this first viewing I did feel that there were a few redeeming qualities, such as the awe-inspiring performance of the marvellous legendary Johnny Depp and that fun-filled three-way sword-fight scene involving the giant rolling wheel.Now after having gotten used to the sheer ugliness of those mutated seamen slaves, accepted the storyline for what it is and enjoying its many twists and turns, begun to laugh and throw myself into those exciting and comedic action sequences and appreciate the truly extraordinary performances of Bill Nighy, Naomie Harris, Tom Hollander and many others I realise that I could never have been more proud of the film's creators for both greatly differing from their approach to the first film and doing it such justice.Job well done indeed and you thoroughly deserve that Academy Award!",10,0,1,24 March 2009
Argo," Seems to good to be true, but it is very true indeed
","All children of the 70s and earlier will recollect, to some degree, the alarming news story of the brutal attack and capture of the Iranian American Embassy towards the end of the decade, by the enraged victims of the despotic Shah whose illegitimate seizure of power the American Government had fully supported. The horrors faced by the American staff who were brutally held as hostages in an attempt to force the government to allow the hated exiled Shah, who America was protecting, to be brought to justice, were the stuff of one's worst nightmares, and almost impossible to fully imagine. It was a truly gripping saga that occupied the news both in and outside of America for months, but an even more twisted turn of events that received deliberately less coverage was that of six diplomats who managed to escape the hostile protesters and mercifully found refuge in the Canadian Embassy. As the Iranian political climate became even more violently anti-American, to the point of extremity, it seemed ever more impossible to extricate these six survivors, until skilled agent Tony Mendez brought an ingeniously unorthodox rescue plan to the table. He planned to have them fly back to America disguised as Canadian filmmakers on a location scout in the Orient for a B-Grade science fiction Hollywood production entitled Argo. From a simultaneously oddball yet chilling declassified story from the archives of the American Central Intelligence Agency, rookie filmmakers Ben Affleck and Chris Terrio have managed to serve up a perfectly thrilling heist film with the added touch of many clever comedic scenes, and all on the solid foundation of arrestingly real political conflicts.The opening scene of the terrifying riot outside the embassy is captivatingly intense, yet tragic, as those on and off the screen are both fearfully preparing for an unstoppable invasion by burning and shredding as many confidential documents as they can, but also anticipating it with a melancholic sense of inevitable, impending doom. Despite the drama, this opening retains a sense of documentary-style realism, strengthened by several intercut shots of a room full of world- weary Iranian citizens waiting for their liberating American Visas. The mundane tedium of their long exercise in patience grounds the scene in a historical integrity.Few of the other major sequences are so committed realistic, but we don't need them to be. We enjoy the observant black comedy of the deliberations between imbecilic government officials who seem less capable of saving the diplomats' lives than their cleaning staff, and even more entertainingly, the astute dissection of the Hollywood sci- fi/fantasy production line. The CIA board's understanding of the country they are attempting to infiltrate is as shamelessly stereotypical as the movies that have been worked on by special effects designer John Chambers (John Goodman) and big-time director Lester Seigel (Alan Arkin), who use their Hollywood know-how to create an authentic fake movie. Watching these two acting veterans making Terrio's dialogue ring with such welcome comic relief is a delicious treat on top of the riveting humanist heist story.Although the heightened intensity of their depicted ordeal carries some of the sadism of a squirmy thriller, where the character's pain becomes the audience's pleasure, we never forget that these events did actually take place thirty years ago, in more or less the same fashion. The characters that find themselves cornered by the horrific dangers of the streets outside, the Iranian government's rapid progress towards finding their hideout and the unbelievable craziness of Tony's scheme, are very relatable, fleshed-out and very true to life, as is their situation. A comparison against images from the film of these key figures, and the horrors of the environment they were trapped in, reveal just how meticulously they were recreated. As Robert Anders, Mark and Cora Lijek, Lee Schatz and Joseph and Cathleen Stafford, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham, Clea Duvall, Rory Cochrane, Scoot McNairy and Kathy Stafford are modestly believable, and are even made to look very much like the actual six from the 'Canadian Caper.' Even Arkin and Goodman, who still wear their grand personalities over their naturalistic characterisations, bear an impressive resemblance to the real movie-making gurus behind the elaborate plan. However, the creative license taken in pursuit of chuckles and chills, most notably with the contrivances of the nail- biting climax, are effective, forgivable, and offset by the stark realism of scenes as such as those showing teams of thousands Iranians hurriedly piecing together the shredded documents and photographs from the embassy for political ammunition. It isn't hardened psychopathic mercenaries who are racing towards the knowledge of the six escapees with their razor-sharp perception. Instead, it is the jigsaw puzzle skills of innocent children inside whom their parents have started to breed a simplistic hatred of Americans, and the support of a tyrannical movement to kill and oppress them all in the name of justice because they installed a tyrannical leader who killed and oppressed them. Even though the film rarely returns to these political issues after the very helpful prologue, the hypocrisy of both nations is interesting to contemplate.",9,0,1,17 December 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pure pirate perfection, to see this film once is worth all the gold and silver in the world!
","The idea of plucking a long-time neglected genre out of the dark, combining it with concepts introduced by a theme park ride and throwing the varied combination of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley does seem bizarre and risky. Admittedly director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer had no idea what they had created when they first released this spectacle into the theatres, and certainly weren't prepared for its instant monumental success. Though one must remember that nowadays twentieth century pirate adventure flicks are considered predictable and shallow light entertainment that really only haven't been criticised because of when they were made. Indeed, you might say that it is a miracle that this film was even accepted by today's audience and its creators were very fortunate not to be insulted over and over by thousands of cynical and terribly displeased critics. But no it definitely wasn't fortune that got this over the line and beyond, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl' differs greatly from the others in many ways. The major one being Depp's exceptional performance as the film's central character: notorious, elusive, sly and unpredictable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow. His unique portrayal turns what could have been yet another classic specimen of a famous stereotype into a character that is hilarious, charming, poignant and perplexing.The other cast members are also pitch-perfect, and some of them are even better: Rush is wonderful as the cunning and horridly cruel villain; Orlando and Keira are nothing outstanding and we feel that we have seen their characters countless times before, but neverhteless they do manage to pull off the pair of heroic lovers that they play quite nicely; Jack Davenport is superb as the dutiful Commodore who greatly despises piracy; Jonathan Pryce is decent as a cowardly governor and the protective father of Keira's character; Kevin.R.McNally is excellent in the role of an old companion of Jack's; and the dynamic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are delightful as two bumbling blundering pirate buddies under the the service of Rush's character.The music is incredible, and greatly enhances the overall uplifting and exciting feel of the film. The choreography of the action sequences are outstanding, the special effects work beautifully, the costumes are very well designed as are the sets...This is my equal-third favourite film, with the other two being 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I really sincerely do mean that, no other of my reviews says this. I just hope that i have given this film the vast quantity of praise that it deserves.It completely shatters the Walt Disney Company's reputation for being able to create only babyish kids cartoons and similar live action movies. Though it is still a bold and daring little company that thrives on risky endeavours, like the dazzling 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', such as this.",10,2,5,17 March 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Utterly disgusting, a shameful mockery of the beloved fantasy classic
","Many years ago a great literary genius captured children's imaginations with an astonishing fantastical masterpiece inspired an old vision of his in which a faun was standing in the snow holding an umbrella.In 2005, Disney  after watching for years the excitement and wonder that the Harry Potter adaptations had conjured up - became jealous of Warner Brothers for their incredible ability to create such an incredible fantasy series that people of all ages could enjoy and used this novel to try and do the same.The results are ghastly, clearly all these people are interested in is making just another depthless action blockbuster and since they can't be bothered coming up with their own story they've borrowed someone else'. Here we see that in chasing this nightmarish dream the director  Andrew Adamson  has abandoned the story, the richness, the warmth and the characters and left them to rot while he tries to cook up an entire film based purely on special effects and stunt work. Well I must say he's failed at that, the cheaply done CG animals are so lifeless and fake that they make plastic figurines look like the real thing. The same can be said for the painfully numerous action scenes which are slow, irritating, completely unnecessary and appear to be merely dodgy tricks to fill in time.The cast is almost no help at all; most of them give such bland performances that the marvellous array of different characters just becomes one big tedious mess. I doubt any of them have even read the book let alone understood it, and they seem to have just gone with the obvious stereotype. The best example of this is the clueless Tilda Swinton, who gives such a revolting performance that she should have her Oscar confiscated. Jardis is a tyrannical monster of a woman that seeks to control all of Narnia no matter the cost, Swinton turns her into a harmless ditsy little fairy princess.Though that said there are a few exceptions: Georgie Henley is just perfect as Lucy, the young actress portrays the character with all the sweetness, innocence and vulnerability that she deserves; James McAvoy does show the tentative, emotional and brave sides of Mr Tumnus very well; and Jim Broadbent does a fair job in the role of the professor.But all in all this is nothing short of pathetic, aside from those three actors there is not a smidgeon of talent to be seen in any areas of this film and it is a terrible adaptation of C.S.Lewis' treasured rare gem.However, devoted fans of the book do not despair: there is a splendidly done 1988 BBC television adaptation directed by Marilyn Fox and starring Sophie Wilcox, Jonathan.R.Scott, Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Barbara Kellerman and William Todd Jones.",1,5,9,8 March 2009
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A cut above the rest
","Over the past few decades, comedy has become a devilishly treacherous genre, accumulating numerous convolutions for both the audience and filmmakers ever since the word 'comedy' semantically shifted from 'lightweight drama with a happy ending' to 'a nonstop rollercaster ride of laughs at the cinema'. Story, characters, and even technical cinematic merit are usually pushed aside, either by demand of the audience or the laziness of the filmmakers, to make way for a riotous barrage of unevenly handled gags. In the event of a misfire – which, due to the unpredictable subjectivity of humour, could happen at any time – the humorous smokescreen is suddenly lifted from the eyes of any sophisticated cinema connoisseurs and the sight of the big, fat, filthy, empty void of a film that has been placed in front of them immediately disengages them. On the other hand, the more laidback moveigoers sitting around them will most likely still be recovering from the excitement of the previous bout of witticism and content to stare at the sexually-charged scenery whilst waiting for the next funny moment. However, if there is a long-term humour drought – such as one that last throughout the entire movie – then both parties will completely lose interest, with the former referring to the film as 'pedestrian' and the latter calling it 'gay'.Fortunately for all, Crazy, Stupid, Love. does not even take the gamble in the first place. It delivers multiple multi-faceted and secretly interlocking stories and many genuinely interesting and entertaining characters for it to fall back on, and which provide the film with real substance and a reason for the gags to be there. Without such things, comedy movies are simply stand-up routines and movie musicals and merely concert films – not that any members of the general public really care about this, but a film that goes down this lazy alleyway will almost always become bait for pompous critics and hypocritical everyday cynics. These movies are all forgettable, momentary phenomenons and huge and financial successes, but they also became subject to decades of relentless slandering after the fuss has died down, whereas films like Crazy, Stupid, Love. continue to have accolades and retain their popularity long after their release because they are uninhibited by a safe use-by date.Popular comedic actor Steve Carell is at the centre of the piece playing Cal Weaver, one those familiar down-on-his-luck middle-aged recently divorced men, but Carell and the adept screenplay writer Dan Fogelman, against expectations, manage to render Cal in a way that feels fresh. In one of the most quick-witted and instantly engrossing openings since last year's The Social Network we see him dining awkwardly in a restaurant with his wife, Emily, and are as shocked as he is when she unceremoniously tells him that she wants a divorce. Yet, once again, a character that could easily have been a clichéd romantic comedy staple is imbued with a satisfying complexity. Played by the very graceful and prolific Julianne Moore, she adores her husband and the cute chemistry between them remains very much alive, however much it falters, for the entire duration of the movie, but after twenty-five years of marriage, beyond the point of the sugar-coated uplifting declaration of young love that concludes most romantic comedies, she is beginning to find that chemistry insufficient. The devastation reduces him to a sad, sorry, pathetic little drunk spending hours moaning about in a bar, a loser that quirky and charismatic womaniser Jacob Palmer (a sensational Ryan Gosling) takes pity on and decides to take under his wing. Under Jacob's guidance, Cal successfully woos and enjoys steamy one-night stands with nine pretty women, no small feet considering he had previously only slept with one woman. Among these seductions is a hilarious double-encounter with spirited tigress Kate (Marisa Tormei having an absolute ball). After a while, Jacob starts to let his talented pupil play freely as he makes some big scores himself, most notably the lovely Hannah (Emma Stone) who has him particularly excited.Meanwhile, Emily is toying gawkily with the wispy upshots of her adulterated love affair with her oft-mentioned arrogant work colleague David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), a fling which Cal and Emily's incredibly precocious and uncannily perceptive son Robbie (talented Zathura alumni Jonah Bobo) can see put in the spanner in the works of the marriage, and always gives the evil to. He too is getting in on the romantic action, having developed an irrepressible infatuation with his 17-year-old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) and, despite her obvious resistance, pursues her with astonishing. Despite the ridiculousness of this 13-year-old's actions, he is just as aware of how it all seems on the outside as the jeering adults are, and one cannot help but empathise and identify with a character so reminiscent and truthful to the frustratedly never taken seriously child that we all once were.These interconnected scenarios are developed naturally and quietly, yet entertainingly, in the end producing a hugely satisfying, electrically comical and genuinely surprising culmination at a point which would ideally be the film's explosive finale, but as always precedes a less high-spirited and gloomier last few concluding scenes that are usually a maddeningly tedious and painfully predictable failed attempt at creating pathos where it is neither wanted nor possible. However, in this case it is perfectly possible and not entirely unwelcome, but it does still leave one feeling that the film was overly long.Nevertheless, this is brilliant work and makes for a highly enjoyable trip to the cinema.",7,1,2,1 October 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Unbelievably extraordinary, a most spectacular finale to the epic adventure series that leaves you completely satisfied.
","Despite the fact that the lovable and popular Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) didn't make an appearance until a fair bit of the movie had passed it still gave the marvellous series the ending it deserved. With the selfish Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) coming in possession of the chest of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and the ability to command the flying Dutchman the pirates have sung the song. Signalling that the time has come to fight back against the East India Trading Company or piracy shall be rubbed out forever. So now Will Turner, (Orlando Bloom) Elizabeth Swann, (Keira Knightley) Pintel, (Lee Arenberg) Ragetti, (Mackenzie Crook) the returned Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) helped by Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) and Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to rescue Jack from the locker of Davy Jones and gather the other nine pirate lords to prepare for the great battle. It's a definite pirate film filled with magnificent acting, fantastic action sequences and a perfect storyline that sums up the stories of the earlier films. Directed by Gore Verbinski and co-starring Stellan Skarsgard, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Keith Richards.",10,0,3,14 March 2009
Midnight in Paris," An unexpected treat
","The fact that 75-year-old Woody Allen opens his latest film with a soothing yet slightly over-indulgent montage of countless Parisian places seems to have led many to believe that he is besotted by this famous city, but they are forgetting that a film director may often just be presenting a viewpoint, may not necessarily share it themselves. In this case, it is likely that this deep passion we see does not belong to Woody Allen, but his effortlessly lovable protagonist, Gil. Brilliantly brought to life by Owen Wilson, a popular comedic actor who often tags along with Ben Stiller, but has left him behind on this outing, Gil is an unshakable romantic who intends to pursue a career as a novelist, with Paris being his ideal writing station. It seems that the only thing holding him back is the insistence of his whiny, closed-minded fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her snobby, overbearing liberalist parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimmi Kennedy) to continue churning out formulaic but reliably profitable Hollywood film scripts as he is currently doing. As the four of them are trying to enjoy a decidedly uncomfortable parisian holiday, they have a chance encounter with Inez's overzealous but good-hearted friend Carol (Nina Arianda), and, much to Gil's annoyance, her insufferable know-it-all husband Paul (Michael Sheen, who rises admirably to the challenge of masking his natural likability), after which the women unite the two younger couples as travel mates for the rest of the trip, but the seething friction between the men make it a very awkward arrangement.As you can see, within the first half hour, the foundations have been laid for yet another zany romantic and situation comedy: the antagonistic goody two-shoes jerk; the clumsy and confused protagonist struggling to satisfy the other characters; the tough, hard-to-please parents, the well-meaning bystander; the tight setting that allows almost no escape; everything's there at the ready. Then Gil sensibly decides to withdraw from the unpleasantness and drop the contented façade, an act of ordinary intelligence that is commonplace in the real world but equates to a stroke of genius in the world of oddball comedy. Heavily drunk and a little out of his senses, he decides to take a nice leisurely stroll around the city streets seeking inspiration for his writing. At the stroke of midnight, sitting down in a particular spot, he magically enters his favourite Parisian era: the 1920s. When this occurs, we are just as surprised as he is, the film having so convincingly set itself up to be something very different. It is perhaps the most cunning and well-executed deception since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). The audience is completely unsuspecting, and until Gil starts running into people like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, T.S. Eliot and Scott Fitzgerald. After having such a fabulous night in what he has always thought of as the Golden Age, Gil becomes a regular visitor, returning to the real world each day with more and more quirky discoveries and fresh ideas, sending his loathsome companions into a state of utter bewilderment. This is another point at which the film diverts from the familiar route, where the female spouse continually complains and obsesses over the male protagonists apparent descent into madness and until he eventually comes to his senses and butters her up once more, because keeping their relationship together is paramount, no matter what the holes have to be patched up with. As Inez takes incessant whinging to soaring new heights, Gil makes no effort to appease her and instead finds solace in being with the lovely Adriana (the wonderful Marion Cotillard), an adventurous young soul, who is one of Picasso's numerous gorgeous muses and lovers. The end result of these relationship dynamics is highly interesting and genuinely surprising, so I won't spoil it.It is these surprising elements that Woody Allen has added used rather unpromising ingredients to put together a very smart and enjoyable film that in the end comes to a very insightful conclusion about Gil's nostalgic romanticism: the past will always seem more inviting than the present, regardless of what era the present might be, for it does often take many years for true beauty to be revealed and appreciated, and there will always be a yearning for that blissful innocence and security of the past. This is not just true of time, but also of place, and that is perhaps what may Woody Allen may have been alluding to in the opening sequence, that Paris is perceived as a perfect paradise, but, as shown with a few of those shots, much of it is as mundane and imperfect as any other Western city. These pieces of thematic material also help to lift this film above the ordinary standard, and make good use of its astutely controlled 94-minute running time, producing a very worthwhile comedic fantasy that also co-stars Carla Bruni, Kathy Bates, Léa Seydoux and Adrien Brody.",7,4,7,5 November 2011
Life of Pi," A must-see for everyone aged 10-101!
","Ang Lee, the Taiwanese director of films such as Sense and Sensibility (2000) and Lust Caution (2007), has decided to give his latest maturely themed feature the visual aesthetic of a charming children's adventure tale. As such, all trailers, posters and inattentively viewed clips of the film make it seem like the perfect holiday fodder for little ones. The parents who brought their toddlers to the session of Life of Pi that I went to weren't entirely incorrect in their assumptions. It is a magical movie, it does tell a fanciful story, and the effect on its audience is altogether uplifting, but the fantastical element is laid on top of a hard, heavy realism that pokes through more than one might expect. The real world isn't blocked out of the piece like an escapist kid's film: it is contrasted against the spiritual fantasy as a way of showing, not telling, its audience why people turn to religion even when modern science seems to constantly conflict with it.Young Pi Patel (played by Gautam Belur, and then Ayush Tandon as an 11- to-12-year-old) has been fascinated by religion since he tried to vandalise a catholic church in rural India, where he and his family own an extensive zoo, and encountered astonishing Christian forgiveness. Since then he has also become a Muslim, and confounded his strict father (Adil Hussain) and the young author (Rafe Spall) that he relates his tale too, which we see in extended flashbacks, with his apparent juvenile miscomprehension that is actually an insightful observation that Hinduism, Islamism and Christianity all really achieve the same end, and simply imagine God in different forms. The interspersed scenes between the reminiscing adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) and the curious writer mostly feel as artificial and unnecessary as such setups always are, with the exception of the protagonist's poignant account of the melancholy end to his relationship with Richard Parker, the fierce but magnificent tiger that everyone has seen on the posters, and his introductory proclamation to the writer that this is a story that will make him believe in God, and I suppose there needs to be someone there for him to say this to, but anyone would do.It takes a surprisingly long time for the teenage Pi (played extraordinarily well by first-timer Suraj Sharma) to be on the lifeboat alone with Richard out on the open ocean wearing a turban, there being a considerable early portion of the film devoted to his family life, but the introduction of the prevalent theme of spirituality runs throughout and the bloodthirsty beauty of the big cat are crucial elements that come from these scenes. Even the mundane, but still mildly interesting, family exchanges, depictions of his school life – where we discover the amusing origin of his name – and a mercifully brief, obligatory romantic sub-plot, are necessary to again show us, not tell us, of his pain when he loses all of this in a shipwreck at about the halfway-point, and begins a compelling and visually stunning fight for his life against the elements, and the astonishingly realised tiger. All of the animals in the film are totally convincing, but it is especially impressive that all sides of the this incredible predator – his strength, his hunger, his nobility, his desperation, his feline grace – are all captured so beautifully, making the multi-faceted symbiotic relationship between the animal and his keeper so totally engrossing. Their gruelling search for land is depicted warts, and quite a few of those hideous warts, which may have been even more unrestrainedly gritty in the original novel by Yann Martel, were quickly driving all of those toddlers out of the cinema before any of them could discover how Pi's tale could defrost a person's rigid atheism, and a good thing too. The trick doesn't lie in his miraculous survival – that would have probably lost the other, older half of the underage audience – but in the very grisly, hard-hitting alternative 'real' version of events that Pi tells a pair of reporters that don't believe the version we've seen, which is very reminiscent of John Steinbeck's Lifeboat, for which the fantastical tale seems to be an allegory. When Pi asks, 'So which story do you prefer?' the hearts of both us and the writer of course unhesitatingly answer 'the one with the tiger,' before our brains can interfere with shallow logical cynicism.While not for very little ones, parents should certainly take children past their single-digit years to see this wonderful telling of a robust but wondrous story of biblical beauty.",9,4,8,7 January 2013
Tangled," Pretty good...
","Disney's homesick return to its nostalgic fairytale style, a move that started in 2007 with the surprisingly delightful Enchanted, has now led to a belated adaptation of the classic fairytale Rapunzel, one they'd surprisingly neglected in their heyday. While it is pleasing to see them pushing forward, and not simply looking back to their previous works and parodying them, it is also a disappointment to realise that the age of those beautiful, treasured animated gems are gone. After years of DreamWorks Animation Studios slowly beating those films to death with relentless childish mockery, it becomes difficult when watching this musical fantasy story to know when and when not it is meant to attract cynical undertones. Also, the ridiculous tendencies towards half-hearted sitcom humour and ersatz pathos that children's movies have acquired over the past few decades have unfortunately not been fought against here, spoiling most of the attempts to recreate the old magic. However, whilst it can never achieve that winsome sense of purity and innocence we love about the classics and thus join them, it still ranks as one of the better and more universally enjoyable kids films of the last ten years. The animation is attractive and colourful, the pacing is mostly slick and tight, the numerous gags don't quite get a laugh but don't fall flat either, the songs here are quite a nice addition – in particular Mother Knows Best and its reprises – and its characters are genuinely interesting. To top things off, its villain, the nasty witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) is the first antagonist with an actually evil countenance seen in a while. Also starring the voices of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi, it should be considered at best as a superior alternative this summer to Gulliver's Travels in the children's movies section, but by no means is it a must- see comedic musical fairytale animation extravaganza.",7,2,6,21 January 2011
Incendies," Not perfect, but unmissable!
","As two teenage siblings are making the funeral arrangements for their prematurely deceased mother, their faithful notary informs them of a very peculiar request that she has left to be completed before her burial. Her children are suddenly told that they have a brother and a father who are still living, and that they are to deliver a secret letter to each of them on her behalf. This situation is succinctly communicated in a very effective opening scene of exposition, and indeed the difficult search of these young adults to find their lost relatives remains the central focus throughout the entire film. A niggling weak point of many critically-acclaimed European films is a frustrating ambiguity in storytelling and a lack of a properly paced narrative, both of which seem to have a certain sadistic purpose about them, as if the intention is to make things as hard for the audience to follow as possible. However, the early firm grounding of plot present here assists greatly with the accessibility, and so is far less discriminative.The scenes making up the body of the piece proceed mostly with a masterful grace, coherence, intrigue and sophistication. The sister, Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) is by far the more willing of the two to carry out their mother's dying wishes – her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette) merely responds with a moody male temper to the words in the will – and so, at least initially, we follow Jeanne, being shown extended flashbacks of the events from her mother's past that she discovers. In these scenes, we see Mrs Nawal Marwan fighting endlessly to survive in a world fraught with terror and violence, being the horrific religious and political conflicts in the Middle East of the 1970s. The challenges she faces make this one of those remarkably engrossing and poignant stories of hope bravery and love that are cinematic gold.The final discoveries and revelations are again satisfyingly comprehensible, but definitely not for the faint-hearted viewer. Still, even if one finds the overall conclusion distastefully grotesque, there is still something to admire in the most apt direction from Denis Villeneuve and a splendid performance from Lubna Azabal as the mother. With a cast that also includes Rémy Girard, Allen Altman, Mohamed Majd and Abdelghafour Elaaziz, Incendies ('Scorched') may have the occasional patch of sluggishness and over-exaggeration, but you still owe it to yourself to see it.",8,5,11,27 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," It wasn't Hogwarts we were attached to, it was the people inside, or Deathly Hallows wouldn't be so unspeakably brilliant!
","The most potent of the established rhythmic norms surrounding the previous six Harry Potter films was the inclusion of a stirring occurrence at the beginning to get things going, a more sedate and steadily-paced poignant build-up in the middle and a very rewarding climax at the end. This winning format also applies to the series as a whole: Philosopher's Stone serves as an introduction, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire push the saga along with great gusto, Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince reflect the escalating tensions and finally the two Deathly Hallows films bring things to a stunningly satisfying riveting conclusion. Fans have followed the series as the characters, the films, the books, the iconic actors and they themselves have matured bit by wondrous bit, and now they deserve a final stupendous culmination.For those who have never read a word of J.K Rowling's writings, the first half of Voldemort's villainous endeavour to secure a total domination over the wizarding world and its often courageous but mostly desperate opposing struggle to his power is powerfully conveyed. Those familiar with the story will be impressed by the wonderful performances given by the always-dependable cast, as well as the very pleasing depiction of all of the key exciting and engaging events. For the entire audience, there are plenty of thrilling moments that masterfully manipulate the senses, most notably Nagini's truly terrifying leap at the camera after Voldemort's kills one of his helpless victims and says 'dinner.' Swathed in a sinister sense of genuine danger, fearful secrets, conflicting emotions, intoxicating adrenalin and occasional effective comic relief, it is a must-see contemporary masterpiece that children can actually see. Directed by David Yates, the best of the Harry Potter directors, it of course stars that lovable trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as well as the brilliant Ralph Fiennes, with Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter making memorable appearances.",10,9,14,21 November 2010
Hugo," So beautiful! It works wonders on everyone!
","Once again this school holidays we have another family film pestering serious moviegoers to be seen because of its impressive line-up of talent on both sides of the camera, its dazzlingly positive reviews, its boastful incorporation of weighty concepts and its self-professed widespread appeal. People eventually discard their misgivings and hop and board because they feel that they would otherwise be missing out on something important. Unfortunately, the film usually disappoints as soon as the audience begins critically examine this critically-lauded film and finds its story to rife with revolting clichés, its themes plucked from easy and overused targets, such as World War 2, and its universality entirely dependent on the younger viewers misunderstanding the true substance of the piece.For these deficiencies, the critics always make the excuse that one must re-enter that state of childlike acceptance of the preposterous in order to fully appreciate the film. However, they condemn those that do watch films in this same mindset when writing about the way they flock heedlessly to summer blockbusters. It often seems that reviewers just arbitrarily pick out one of the many hackneyed and saccharine family films and refer to them as 'heart-warming'.Hugo, however, doesn't ask forgiveness for anything. All it requires of us is two hours of our time to show all the spectacular tricks it can perform. Adapted from Brian Selznick's book The Adventures of Hugo Cabret is a film in two indistinct halves: one simple, slow and enigmatic, elevated by astonishing visuals, the other more pacey and fascinatingly complex, with more of a focus on story; one exploring the wonders of machinery, the other delving into the rich world of early cinema.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is one of the many orphans left in the aftermath of the Great War, now scraping out an existence stealing food from the shops of a Parisian train station and dwelling inside and secretly operating the intricate workings of the enormous clock tower that overlooks the busy swarm of passengers boarding the trains to work each day. He is constantly dodging and living in fear of the ruthless station insepctor (Sacha Baron Cohen), a hardened war veteran who hobbles about in a troublesome, squeaky peg leg. However, it is not the inspector who eventually catches him but the equally humourless and world-weary owner of a toy repair shop (Ben Kingsley) who catches him stealing parts for a mysterious project. He seizes searches and harasses the poor boy, who he sees as a worthless thief, finding an eerily familiar notebook of mechanical calculations and sketches in his pockets, which he confiscates. Hugo insists on having it returned to him, no matter how many times the man refuses or threatens him, and goes to the point of enlisting the help of the man's sympathetic ward Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz).It takes quite a while for any light to be shed on the subject of this all-important notebook, or indeed anything else surrounding the boy or the old man, but it would be terrible of me to reveal anything as the audience is very deliberately kept in the dark for much of the movie. As I've said before, the breathtaking 3D imagery of the vague early passages prevents the audience from drifting off or becoming impatient. Details such as the camera's swift turns and dips in a fast-paced navigation through stylistically designed cascading snow-covered rooftops, jungles of clockwork and fast-moving steam trains make every scene utterly captivating.Then, as secrets are uncovered, characters fleshed out, relationships cemented and dramatic events start to occur, the eye candy is either packed away so as not be distracting, or the audience becomes accustomed the stunning aesthetic – I'm not sure which – and the film takes flight in a very different way. As describing these climactic sections is impossible to do without ruining its effect – this is the most prevalent flaw in the concept of film reviews – let me simply say for all its teetering on the edge of toxic contrivances, it pulls through with believability and purpose. In fact, it is on these latter two qualities where it finds the common ground between the two aforementioned fields. At least in its early stages, motion pictures were among the other stupendous carnival attractions that impressed everyone with its innovative creation of a seamless illusion.Finally, as for the ensemble of accomplished cinematic practitioners, due credit must go to Martin Scorcese, who directs without losing his artistic integrity or his maturity, but still ensuring that younger audiences will have something to marvel at, and some element of the film's meaning to hold onto. His cast has been impressively assembled, and do a fine job in their roles. It is a pleasure to see Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Frances de la Tour (all who are now best known for their involvement in the Harry Potter films), the lovely Emily Mortimer, the charming Jude Law, the irrepressibly robust Ray Winstone and the monstrously prolific, now 89-year-old Christopher Lee taking on colourful supporting roles. However, deserving of particular mention are Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen and Kingsley give terrifically sympathetic and multi-layered portrayals of two of the war's most miserable victims, and while Kingsley has put his abilities to good use, Cohen sadly often wastes his lively comic charisma trying to offend as many people as possible instead of making them appreciated in films like Sweeney Todd and Madagascar. Most importantly, our young star Master Butterfield has finally found some worthy exposure for his remarkable portrayals of troubled boys who have long lived in very difficult circumstances, but have hardly grown especially stealthy or adept at coping with their environment, and still retain an internal emotional delicacy.So, believe me when I say that Hugo is a must-see remarkable cinematic achievement for the entire family, and, best of all, you can critically analyse all you like, it can take it!",8,5,7,29 January 2012
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Entertaining but exasperating as well. I could hardly believe it only went for 89 mins.
","In 2005, the DreamWorks animation team first released the CGI feel-good, comedy-adventure 'Madagascar,' which probably introduced the idea of referring to the atlas for a movie title which was used last year by Baz Lhurmann. From the day the first posters and trailers appeared, it was shaping up to be the year's ultimate washout. Yet because it had the advantage of being the only kids flick around at the time, audiences were rolling in anyway. When moviegoers saw the film itself, they realised that their prediction was partly wrong. It was definitely a long journey down the quality line from some of DreamWorks' previous creations; though it was witty, fast-paced enough and boasted an all-star, energetic voice cast and so managed to get over the line. However,  despite the open ending  it was definitely not proper series material. But that didn't stop Hollywood, who clearly doesn't know when to let go sometimes. And so after four years the four most unlikely friends in the animal kingdom are back with more outlandish adventures.The first one ended when the outrageously eccentric King Julien (voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen) is farewelling the 'freaks' as they are about to leave the tiny island of Madagascar on a boat with no fuel  but only the penguins (voiced by Tom McGrath, Chris Miller, Christopher Knights, and Conrad Vernon) are aware of that technical problem. After a flashback opening telling of the origins of Alex the clumsy dancing lion (voiced by Ben Stiller,) the sequel picks up not long after that. When Alex, his best pal Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock,) hypochondriac giraffe Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer,) and great fat feisty hippo Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinckett Smith,) are leaving for New York on a faulty aeroplane made by the penguins  the substitute for the boat  with King Julien, his manservant Maurice (voiced by Cedric the Entertainer,) and tiny little baby lemur Mort (voiced by Andy Ritcher,) and the monkeys tagging along. Instead of reaching their destination, they crash-land in a wildlife reserve on the continent of Africa  yep, you guessed it! There Alex is reunited with his long-lost mother and father (voiced by Bernie Mac and Sherri Shepherd) and the other three are overwhelmed by the sight of thousands of their own kind. The penguins and the monkeys however, spend most of their stay attempting to repair the plane and get them to New York. Now as you might expect the animals find that they are not suited to life in the wild, and that's the shortcut scriptwriter Etan Cohen utilises to generate complications that keep the picture going. Will these four ever be satisfied!? Or does there have to be more sequels until they find the right place!?By some unearthly coincidence, every single character in the original is here again for the sequel, and not one of them has changed. What is more, the few new characters that have been thrown into the mix are hardly given a chance to be noticed over the screen-hogging old faces. But that is not the start of this film's many failings that could have easily been avoided if directors Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell had put their minds to it  and seeing as there's two of them it should have been a snap. True, no animated film is truly complete without a sprinkle of humour, but you don't have to overdo it. I thought this company knew that, seeing as 'Shark Tale' (2003,) and the classic hit 'Shrek' (2001,) used more than that single element to engage its audience. Obviously they've forgotten. For while the original made an effort to be exciting, groovy and slightly moving as well as funny, the second one has lazily crammed an overload of predictable, run of the mill jokes into nearly every scene, leaving hardly any room left for any remotely serious dialogue. On top of that, only about a quarter of the thousand and one gags are genuinely humorous, and only a quarter of that quarter will actually get a laugh.Still despite all this there is something about this film  maybe the voice cast that also includes Alec Baldwin, Will i Am, Quinn Dempsey Stiller, Declan Swift and Elisa Gabrielli who have generously agreed to be a part of this even though there are many decent films that would be much worthier of their talent  that makes it a little more bearable than most ones of this sort, and even almost enjoyable. But please, no more! One was plenty, two is more than enough, but three would be just awful!",6,0,0,13 March 2009
Silver Linings Playbook," totally engrossing
","There is a particular scene in which the combined empathetic artistry of writer director David O. Russel, lead actors Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and supporting actors Julia Stiles and John Ortiz encapsulate the heart of the message behind Silver Linings Playbook. The tempestuous, brazen Tiffany (who better than Lawrence) and the more subdued and cheerful, but still socially tactless Pat (Cooper) are two people with bipolar disorder who are getting to know each other for the first time. The topic of medication arises, and they both comfortably discuss the effects of lithium and other pills as casually as other people would discuss hayfever tablets and other treatments that are mundane to them. Meanwhile, a quick cut reveals their two neurotypical, or 'normal,' dinner hosts listening bewilderedly to a conversation they don't have a hope of connecting with. Pat and Tiffany and playing one of the titular silver linings of making conversation about the day-to-day challenges of their condition. These unusual difficulties don't make them any less three-dimensional and human, but on some occasions, these symptoms are especially problematic, and can't be dealt with as easily.Pat, as we soon learn, had had his peaceful domestic existence shattered by one freakish incident of violent manic depression. After spending eight months in the chaotic mixing pot of a mental institution, he returns to the outside world to find that beautiful wife and all of his work colleagues have all taken out fearful restraining orders against him, and that his entire neighbourhood is still in a state of confused, ignorant shock at this single fatal outburst. His only points of refuge are the home of his unconditionally loving parents, his daily exercise routines, and, in ways less obvious to him, Tiffany's companionship. Of all the narrow-minded, callous parents of disabled children to have been seen on screen and in the real world, Pat's parents and certainly the most compassionate. Pat Sr. (an enthusiastically erratic Robert De Niro) also has a disorder – Obsessive Compulsive – and often finds that his son exhibits similar behaviour to himself, but tries tirelessly to be the voice of reason in his son's life. He's always asking Pat junior to watch football games together with him and his mother, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), on the couch, insisting that he should have quality family time, when it's always out of his undeniable superstitious wish to see his team score well in the presence of his good luck charm. Dolores is as caring, selfless and well-meaning as only a mother can be, but she is also understandably overwhelmed by the challenge of living with two such dangerously unpredictable men. It's quite a shock to see Weaver playing a much gentler matriarch than in her previous, chilling performance in Animal Kingdom (2010) and impressive to see her be just as controlling, but infinitely sweeter in her second Oscar-nominated dramatic turn.Pat's other primary relationship, with Tiffany, largely follows the successful formula of Josh Hartnett and Radha Mitchell's characters in Mozart and the Whale (2005) who both had Asperger's Syndrome. Pat's an emotionally insecure man. Tiffany's an unashamedly emotional woman. Pat is quite mild-mannered, but still lacks a social filter. Tiffany is very brazen and puts more conviction behind her inappropriate interjections. She is also much more accepting of the realities of her different psychological profile. Pat, on the other hand, is very uncomfortable with his disorder and desperate to live the life of a neurotypical, and insults by her insisting that he's nowhere near as crazy as she is.When it comes to depicting mental disorders, two are evidently better than one, especially if they're of different genders. Both ends of the spectrum can be explored, and we can see that two individuals with the same condition will not always be compatible. Pat's hypocrisy, like Donald Morton's in Petter Næss' film, is the main source of conflict between them, as well as the usual relationship hurdles that would be present without the disorder. The romantic destination of the narrative is still fairly obvious, but not really set in motion until the last few scenes. It is mostly the ups and downs of friendship, not partnership, that we see played out between them.There are a few perhaps innate clichés that seep into the screenplay, such as the default suspenseful plot device of a high-stakes bet between a likable character and a sneaky protagonist, the last-minute dramas before a crucial event that's been pending for most of the film, the usual pep-talk to the uncertain male lead that inspires him to chase the girl of his dreams before it's too late, and some other victimless crimes against originality, but most of these are offset by the intelligent execution of the story, and some are even worked to the film's advantage.A more than solid enough foundation is built with the brilliantly written and portrayed character – including a very lovable mental patient played by an unrecognisable Chris Tucker – and the very engaging thematic material, which easily holds together a narrative that's occasionally rickety, and makes an enjoyable, captivating film out of a very challenging subject.",9,0,1,16 February 2013
Ratatouille," If Pixar sinks any lower than this, they're doomed.
","Pixar are still producing interesting and enjoyable films, but lately the famous creators of the first ever fully computer generated film 'Toy Story' 1995 have been losing their touch. The possibly last real masterpiece 'The Incredibles' 2004 really shone as a spectacular ,unique and altogether wonderful film. Cars 2005 was interesting but used up most of its originality at the beginning.Now 'Ratatouille' doesn't have the vast quantity of brilliance that the earlier films had but who could criticise a film with such heart. It's told us that cooking is not a chore but an art. If you take pleasure out of cooking then you will like watching this and people who aren't so keen will most likely have their opinions altered.This movie's central character is Remy, a rat with great dreams, passion, intellect and smell. But he lives with hundreds of other rats who eat mindlessly out of garbage bins and have very different points of view. One day after a disastrous and near fatal encounter with a mad, elderly lady all the rats are forced to flee their home. But during the escape Remy goes astray and ends up at a Parisian restaurant that was once famous but now neglected. There he is saved by the soft heartedness of a simple garbage boy named Linguini who is trying to live up to his father. When the two friends combine each other's assets they become a very fine chef that begins to restore the sensation of the restaurant.But when Anton Ego Â– a superficially harsh and sinister food critic, hears of the new success of the restaurant and of Linguini he decides to review the restaurant once more. His visit diminishes the friendship of the now former companions and the happiness of the story. Then when the pressure of the situation dives away all of the other chefs Linguini, Remy and the newly located other rats must reunite and stop the restaurant's reputation from being ruined beyond repair.It's a comedy that shows us how any two living things can befriend each other. But it does drone on and lose its audience in some parts.",5,2,6,15 March 2009
Enchanted," A most notable modern tribute to the old classics.
","When two brothers decided to write a collection of simple children's tales they never thought that they would become so well-known and certainly never considered them to inspire hundreds of terrific other books, stage shows and of course films. Some of these have reverently mocked them, such as the timelessly entertaining 'Shrek' series (2001- .)'Brothers Grimm' (2002) exposed the gruesome gore hidden in these stories. But largely the most successful and perhaps the most exceptional of the lot are the marvellous array of award-winning animated classics from the legendary Walt Disney Company that initiated with the ground-breaking masterpiece 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937.) And now in Christmas 2007  nearly seven years after their final cartoon release 'The Emperor's New Groove' (2001) they've decided to come back for more with a vastly more modern creation that isn't quite as pleasurable as the others but still a success.This is the charming story of another sweet, beautiful princess. Once upon a time in the faraway kingdom of Andalasia there lived a lovely young woman named Giselle (a splendid Amy Adams.) She lived in a small cottage deep in the woods with her many animal friends and every day dreamed of meeting her one true love. One day a dashing young prince named Edward (James Marsden) rode past the cottage singing a love song, Giselle rushed up to meet him and as soon as they each set eyes on one another they new that they were destined to be wed and so the wedding was instantly arranged. The word of this union soon spread throughout the land and everyone was overjoyed to hear the wonderful news, all except for Prince Edward's cruel stepmother Queen Narissa (a most wonderfully intimidating Susan Sarandon.) She knew that if her son married she would lose the crown and so banished poor Giselle to a feared place where no one ever lives happily ever after.So out she pops through a manhole into the busy streets of New York. Dazed and confused, she takes shelter in the home of a placid, sensible divorce lawyer named Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his adorable little daughter Megan (Rachel Corvey) who have been at a great loss since the death of their wife and mother. Back in Andalasia Giselle's faithful friend Peppi the chipmunk (voiced by Kevin Lima and Jeff Bennett) has lead the prince through the portal and into the real world to save his true love. Now more furious than ever, the Queen sends her lovesick slave Nathaniel (a masterful Timothy Spall) to make sure that he does not find her. After he fails, she makes an incredibly dramatic and terrifying entrance into New York as well to take matters into her own hands.The film's main power source  apart from its vastly compelling cast  is the delightful entertainment in watching exaggerated, unrealistic fairytale concepts being put to the test in the world of reality. This film definitely shows that although their founder is long gone and they've changed immensely over the years they still have some of the unique quality that's made them what they are today left in them.",7,0,0,1 March 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," Not exactly a must-see, but the best thing to see with the little ones
","Much has been said of the way that Disney's latest and of this decade greatest animated release portrays the inside world of video games as inventively as Pixar first caught our attention by opening up the world of toys. Indeed, the familiar and invented video game characters featured in Wreck it Ralph move and talk in their off-duty periods just as you would imagine, being sure to please avid gamers just as much as Pixar's first feature delight toy-lovers. The joys of being an arcade favourite are highly prized and quite viciously fought over between games, just like the need to be played with in the toy world. Even more so, the threat of suddenly being deemed defective or dull, and consequently 'unplugged', hangs ominously over the proceedings. The children in Toy Story were always prone to having fads, novelties, and maturing interests draw them away from formerly beloved toys, but it would still take them a long time to finitely abandon their physically present plastic companions. In the gaming world, it can happen in an instant to any game it seems, apart from classics like Pac-Man. Both films also have, as a narrative starting point for the main adventures, the visible jealous frustrations of a protagonist who feels unjustly treated. However, while Woody's bitter envy of the effortlessly popular Buzz Lightyear was graspable, but not terribly sympathetic, the plight of the title character of Disney's picture rings immediately with undeniable unfairness and endears us completely to the poor man. Ralph (appropriately voiced by the always endearing John C. Reilly) is the burly villain of the fictional game Fix-It Felix Jr., all day performing the thankless task of smashing a perfectly constructed red brick house floor by floor, so that Felix, the lovable hero, can repair the damage and receive a medal from the ever-so-friendly residents, who then toss poor Ralph off the top floor and into the mud.In the opening expositional scenes of the film, he shares his misery with his fellow villains at a meeting of Bad Guys Anonymous, and to the audience. He desperately wants the respect and love that the heroes are laden with each day, and becomes convinced that to somehow procure a medal like the ones Felix is always get will see him enjoy these privileges.To any frequenter of animated children's film the plot point of this superficial quest seems bound for one resolution only: a session of sentimental moralising where Ralph realises that the medal doesn't matter, that it can't buy him friendship that he shouldn't seek to be anything other than what he is. Woody's story went down a similar path, but unlike Woody, Ralph eventually meets an unlikely kindred spirit in his loneliness and torment. Vanellope, a little girl car racer from the aptly named Sugar Rush game, threatens at first to be the writers' self- confessed highly annoying comic sidekick, but is soon shown to be just as much of a sympathetic outcast as Ralph. King Candy, the erratic, word-playing sovereign of this Willy-Wonk-like land of creative confectionery constructions and pricelessly sweet puns has marginalised her as a poisonous glitch in the game, preventing her from racing. A stickler for game conventionalism, he quickly becomes the adversary of the odd couple of heroes, who are also being chased by the stout Felix as well as Calhoun, the fearless, no-nonsense army commander of Hero's Duty.As lovely as the friendship between the tiny girl and giant man may be, not quite enough time is spent on the entertaining banter and remittent co-operation between the prickly indomitable woman and the smaller, sweeter man at her side. That said, we certainly get a satisfying amount of the wacky King that seems a deviously eccentric cross between Uther Pendragon from the new TV series Merlin and, more obviously the Mad Hatter from Disney's cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland (1951), with the look and voice of that character clearly being an inspiration. Alan Tudyk, who's perhaps best known for playing the naked drugged-up fiancée in Death at a Funeral (2007), in many ways emulates Ed Wynn's zany sing- song tones, exaggerating even more the hilarious lisp. He and Sarah Silverman, who, at 42, miraculously reaches the giddy heights of an 8- year-old's voice as Vanellope, were the two unexpected pieces of perfect casting. As expected, John C. Reilly as the gentle Ralph and Jane Lynch, who plays Sue Sylvester in Glee, as the fierce Calhoun are effortlessly brilliant, and it's also a nice surprise to hear the voice of Ed O'Neil as the owner of the arcade.On top of the humour, the pathos, the quality animation, the action and the clever characterisations, which you'd expect from a director – Rich Moore – who's worked quite extensively on The Simpsons and Futurama, the visual design of literally several whole universes inside the games world is quite stunning, especially the joyously colourful land of Sugar Rush, but it's really the excitement of the story that makes the biggest impact. It would appear that executive producer John Lasseter has enforced the old Pixar maxim 'The story is king!' as the graphics, as impressive as they are, are never expected to carry or even save the movie, that job has rightly been given to the narrative. Now that the new digital Disney studio is finally starting to learn a thing or two from the medium's greatest pioneer, let's hope the pupil hasn't outshone the master after the release of Monsters' University, the third consecutive sequel that Pixar has produced this decade.",7,1,2,3 January 2013
Django Unchained," Just see it
","It was always inevitable that exceptional writer/director (and actor) Quentin Tarantino would do a Western. The gleefully grisly tone; the loveably amoral characters who stay true to an alternative sense of morality. Plot lines that elongate, intertwine, divert and snap short at their leisure. All in a heightened idiosyncratic universe of escapism where charming deal out gruesome deaths to foes, friends and passers-by as casually as swatting flies, and where the bold yet astute filmmaker runs rife with risqué creativity. It's comfortably close to his beloved gangster genre, but with more of the outdoors and a frivolous willingness to embrace its masculine excess. In rekindling a genre that's lain dormant for quite a few years, Tarantino has always embraced the nostalgic time period of the classic Spaghetti Western, adding the old grainy Columbia logo, old-fashioned cartoon custom-made credits and titles and a recurring strumming guitar theme song celebrating the titular hero.It's through the protagonist and his personal plight that Django Unchained, like last year's The Artist, brings a defiant, retrospective modern theme to a stylistically old school picture. Yes, the brusquely exuberant filmmaker, who as a man is unexpectedly as mild-mannered and talkative as a geeky YouTube blogger, has controversially delved deep into the issues of black slavery and apartheid, in a film that's no less entertaining for it. This murderous gunslinger hasn't been driven to thoughts of vengeance simply over an old flame. Years of suffering in a world controlled by ignorant, corrupt Caucasians – revealed through rustically shot flashbacks that actually use nostalgia to add realism – has gradually seeded a bursting hatred of the privileged race that's finally unlocked, along with his dreaded shackles, by an unlikely humanitarian vigilante also interested in him as a business partner. The business is, of course, that old staple of Westerns, bounty hunting, and the eccentric, smooth talking, tenacious German Dr King Shultz (the brilliant Christoph Waltz) has special need of Djan-go (Jamie Foxx adds layer upon layer to his characterisation with every scene) in his next pursuit, as his next juicy targets have gone undercover, and our hero, having had a bloodthirsty encounter with them before they were outlawed, is the only one who can identify them. The tricky doctor is one of those most priceless hedonistic characters whose conscience is muckier than a drainpipe, but whose heart, the audience can see, is in the right place when it matters. His causal killings abhor us no more than James Bond's, and, like Jack Sparrow, there seems to be no situation this invincible rogue can't talk, scheme or shoot his way out of.He contrasts very sharply with our two other main despicable figures, who really do care for no one but themselves, however much they may pretend otherwise, and regard all people Django's race totally as brain- dead pawns, even though one of them is black himself. The vast middle section of the film is occupied by Fritz's and Django's nail-biting battle of wits with an arrogant, insulated wealthy businessman (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his jarringly sycophantic (an unrecognisably elderly Samuel L. Jackson) Negro right-hand man constantly echoing his master's callous commands to the other black servants, and laughing at his vile jokes made at their expense. It was quite a curious decision to cast these two naturally likable actors as two such realistically repulsive characters, particularly as when we first see the charming DiCaprio as Mr Calvin Candie, we have to immediately remind ourselves not to root for this character like we did with Jack Dawson and Arnie Grape, but he soon proves perfectly able – and quite exceptional in his more menacing scenes – but I had no idea I'd been watching Jackson on screen until I read the credits, and that is the mark of a truly great performance. From that very first, alarmingly potent shot of him looking at the lucky Django riding proudly into town on a horse, like a white fella, with Stephen's face full of chilling, resentful rage, it is a truly stunning portrayal of perhaps the most horrible character of the lot. Although, of course, the pleasing gallery of the heroic duo's small-minded prejudiced victims, moulded from the archetypal Western townspeople, is also effectively detestable.Like all of the greatest and most popular depictions of serious social issues, Django is both heartily funny and brutally dark in equal measure, and often simultaneously. In casual conversations about Tarantino, he's often associated with extreme, vicious violence, and indeed, a few healthy blood splatters are vital to any Tarantino picture, but none of them are ever about the blood and the gore. As actual films, rather than conversation topics, they always feature good characterisations sharp dialogue and clever writing much more than they do gunshots. Just like in the celebrity head's scene of Inglorious Basterds (2009) or the fateful toilet trips of Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction (1994), the inevitable big, glorious shootout in his latest film is the big crescendo to the mesmerising character interplay, and always has consequences explored in the following scenes. Yes, they are fun, both for us and for him, but they do not define him as a filmmaker any more than Grace Kelly, Janet Leigh and so many other blond actresses should define Alfred Hitchcock. These morsels are just the entrées to the meatier main course.Unfortunately, though, those gory climaxes make it more difficult for underage viewers to get a ticket, but that certainly doesn't stop adults from getting in on the healthy fun on offer here.",9,2,6,31 March 2013
Bolt," Absolute garbage from start to finish, with Susie Essman being the only saving grace.
","Disney is the one company most renowned for its universal animated classics, and all these years has only scarcely stepped outside that genre. Though undoubtedly that has been a wise move. It is there that they truly belong, and dozens of prestigious awards that they now have up their sleeve ought to prove it. What's more these achievements aren't just for critics and award judges to adore but audiences to yawn at, they're incredibly entertaining. Naturally they are all very simple, but also full of incredible characters, spectacular animation and beautiful storytelling. Though of course, this is all in the past. Bolt is a perfect specimen of what the company produces nowadays, quick one-dimensional flops whipped up carelessly and effortlessly that bore anyone under the age of eleven out of their brains. To create the story, screenplay writers Dan Fogelman and Chris Williams have taken ideas from 'Stardust' (2007,) 'Toy Story' (1995,) '101 Dalmatians 2: Patch's London Adventure' and who knows how many other films. The animation makes us question whether they put Lego people in front of the camera instead of using computers and the voice cast is half asleep. With the exception of Susie Essman, who is the only cast member that bothered to put some effort and energy into her performance. Though she mightn't have enough fame attached to her name to be mentioned up on the poster with John Travolta and Miley Cyrus, she put a certain realistic liveliness into her character that none of the others could be bothered to do - perhaps they could have, but thanks to their laziness we will never know. But as wonderful as she was, she also is  sadly  bound by the dull script and can never truly flourish.The faulty failure opens with an action-packed chase scene styled like one from a sci-fi adventure television series to introduce canine superhero Bolt (Travolta) and his sidekick owner Penny (Cyrus:) the heroic duo in an epic battle against the sinister 'green-eyed man.' (If you try hard, you may just manage to enjoy this long, exhausting scene.) Then we hear a director yell 'cut!' and see the sky, train, ground, and everything else assumed real being taken down to reveal that everything we just saw was  in the world of the film  part of a TV show. (Shame that the advertising gave that twist away.) Though there is markedly absolutely no difference between Penny and Bolt and the actors who play them (again in the world of the film,) apart from the fact that in the real world Bolt is just an ordinary dog. But while Penny is easily able to distinguish between the world of the show and the world of reality, poor delusional Bolt isn't. He believes that everything being performed on set is actually happening, including his powerful 'super-bark.' So after a scene is filmed that ends on a cliff-hanger in which Penny is kidnapped the poor clueless mutt escapes from the studio and embarks on a ridiculous search for his owner, manipulated by three imbecilic pigeons into dragging a terrified rebellious scruffy old stray cat (Essman) and picking up a demented hamster Bolt TV series fan (voiced by Mark Walton, who tries to be as distinguished as Essman but instead awfully overdoes it.) From there we have about half an hour of redeeming fun before a predictable and seemingly never-ending conclusion.It is now finally clear that Disney has forever lost its touch and should immediately consult Pixar before they even begin to make another animated film from now on. Walt would never have allowed this disaster to occur, but he's long gone and so is his legacy. But hey, get used to it. This film isn't the first of its kind and it certainly won't be the last. So let us let go of the past and brace ourselves for a long and tiresome future.",1,6,36,13 March 2009
Stardust," Just perfect, one of the year's best.
","One of the most stunning book adaptations any author could hope for. Neil Gaiman should be very proud of the ingenious group of filmmakers to have made this. The truly talented cast know their characters exceptionally well. Among them are Robert De Niro, Peter O'Toole, Jason Flemyng, Michelle Pfeiffer, David Kelly, Rupert Everett and Ricky Gervais. A credit must also be given to the crew that successfully wrote, directed, produced and added the finishing touches to this film.This ill-behaved fairytale begins when young Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox) a boy who seems a failure at everything and is desperately trying to avoid it promises the girl of his dreams who never quite loved him in return (Sienna Miller) that he shall bring her a fallen star that they recently saw. He journeys into the magical kingdom of Stormhold that is now in great disarray. There he finds the star that is in fact a beautiful young woman (Claire Danes.) Nevertheless, he wants to take her back home through the gateway.Along the way the quarrelling couple Tristan and the star are hunted by cunning, brutal and merciless villains wanting to slay the star for everlasting youth. They are also helped by strange characters that greatly differ from what they appear to be. At the end of their journey Tristan discover that the answer to all isn't that simple.Directed by Matthew Vaughn and narrated by Ian Mckellen it's a rare masterpiece in which the many deaths  rather than having no rationale  add to the suspense and wake you up to the danger our hero and heroine are in. You'll find aspects of horror, adventure, fantasy, drama, romance, mystery, moral and occasional humour so as it flies by you begin to wonder whether there's anything this film cannot do. See it yourself and you'll believe me.",10,1,2,15 March 2009
Shrek the Third," Enjoyable, but a near miss and only a hair's breadth away from being a flop.
","A wonderful animated adventure set in the fairytale land of Far, Far Away. A little unnecessary and simple but thanks to the help of the old Shrek characters and some clever humour it fits in well as the final of the Shrek trilogy.The frog king Harold (voiced by John Cleese) has died of sickness and old age. This now makes Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) the new king. After hearing this Shrek, Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) go on a quest to find the second heir Artie (voiced by Justin Timberlake) so that Shrek will never have to take up such a responsibility. Meanwhile a group of angry fairytale villains led by the evil Prince Charming (voiced by Rupert Everett) have invaded Far, Far Away after their own Happily Ever After. Charming captures Princess Fiona, (voiced by Cameron Diaz) Queen Lillian (voiced by Julie Andrews) and all the other good fairytale characters, becomes king and sets death traps for Shrek for when he returns. It all seems as if King Charming has finally won but with the magician Merlin (voiced by Eric Idle) on Shrek's side there may still be some hope.It's a very clever story that shows the world of fairy tales in a completely different form.",6,0,2,15 March 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Truly fantastic!!
","This sensational one-of-a-kind spectacle took me completely by surprise and took me to an entirely different world, the dazzling surreal and quite overwhelming universe of the famous french nightclub of the title.There is something truly refreshing about Baz's work. It is so rich, elaborate and filled with such wonder and feeling. Each creation of his is just irresistible and is unlike any conventional film, therefore impossible to categorise it according to genre without disrespecting it.Critics usually express dislike of his films in their reviews as these pictures are not ones meant to be picked apart and analysed, but better watched openly and with an attitude that allows you to be entertained. They aren't ones that are really designed to be reviewed, and watching the clueless and pitiful critics' reaction is quite funny.Moulin Rouge! is certainly no exception, but unfortunately like the marvellous 'Australia' it is quite often unappreciated. Please avoid making such common mistakes and take the wonderful opportunity as I have, and I have never been felt happier!",10,0,3,5 September 2009
Lincoln," As they say, great cinema, but not great history
","Why has Lincoln been a much more critically successful historical portrait than last year's The Iron Lady?Perhaps this is because its real-life protagonist is shown working tirelessly towards the immense, meaningful goal of universal freedom and racial equality, an ideal that's even bigger than his own towering presidential figure. It could also be because the film doesn't hone in too breathlessly close on this single man, as the title and posters suggest, and spends developing the full picture of those much less reputed – albeit white – freedom fighters whose support for the great cause was also crucial. Most likely, though, it is because the complex political intricacies of the abolishment of slavery are really quite meticulously delved into, and not emotively paraphrased.The closest Tony Kushner's screenplay comes to wanting to explore 'Lincoln, the man' is with a handful of diverting but not terribly inspired scenes with him and his two sons – sweet little Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and the stubborn adolescent Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) – and his effectively dramatic interactions with his stalwart wife Mary Todd (a fiercely terrific Sally Field). Other than that, he is explored as a politician – a godlike and all-knowing one, but still a stealthy, reasonably realistic politician.The film devotes itself almost entirely to depicting many details of the work of him and his fellow republicans in passing the 13th amendment through the cutthroat thorny tangles of the American constitution. This achievement, which was arguably Lincoln's most important and tragically final contribution to American society is certainly portrayed with dramatic flair, but also a fair amount of restraint and maturity. The fact is that at the very powerful topmost levels of government, the resolution of this hideously real social issue came down to a matter of carefully swaying the necessary number of ministers one by one in order to ensure the majority vote needed to pass the amendment. No grand, heartfelt humanitarian speeches were made in the hope of inspiring enough men to look deep into the souls and see the justice of the abolishment of slavery. Lincoln's belief in the possibility of changing the law so suddenly might be idealistic, but he's not mad enough to think that he can change social values anywhere near as abruptly. He is constantly strategizing, admittedly with more poise and eloquence than the average schemer, but still as any politician would. He uses the more readily appealing prospect of putting an end to the horrific civil war as a selling point for the amendment. Most controversially, he agrees to meet with peace delegates from the South, infuriating his Secretary of State, William Seward (David Strathairn) who wasn't consulted. He is paranoid that the correspondence will be found out, resulting in huge losses of votes as it becomes apparent that the amendment won't be needed to stop the war, but Lincoln is sure that word would still have gotten out if he refused to meet with the delegates, which would have been even more fatal to their campaign. His shrewd handling of the matter is as diplomatic as any lawyer or politician balancing press and personal values.Despite Lincoln constantly exuding wholesome wisdom and total integrity, he still has a game to play, and his democratic opposition, spearheaded and represented by the obnoxious but still quite humanly ambitious Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) more than once attacks Lincoln by calling him a corrupt tyrant for all the times he's taken matters into his own hands. It is curious that Lincoln never sets foot in the constitution. One does wonder how different the chaotic debates would be if he was there to bring them to a steady pace with his lengthy sermon-like anecdotes. Instead, he's the omnipresent but invisible steering force of the amendment. Director Steven Spielberg treats his relationship with his ministers as that between Jesus and his disciples, which, despite much historical evidence that suggests otherwise, does make for a very uplifting film.Where Lincoln differs from his other great historical dramas is that while we are expected to sit through and contemplate the complex, austere details of the constitution, which, as adults, we're more than happy about, we are sheltered from the grisly, realistic details of the issue that is actually being dealt with. In the occasional shots and snippets of dialogue that are handed to the black African-Americans themselves, they are depicted as mere, meek, wide-eyed naïfs either waiting innocently for liberation, or grateful for being already rescued from slavery. This is purely a portrait of Lincoln's contribution to anti-slavery, but perhaps a fuller representation of the movement as a whole, which includes the many strong-willed (and female no less) black activists, would have been more interesting than something that comes across as a little too biblical at times.More to its credit, though, the film is very much attuned to the atrocities of the civil war, which, like slavery, is mostly discussed on an intellectual by distanced middle-aged white gentleman, but still more than adequately documented visually. The huge loss of life is talked about in numbers, but it is also shown in very confronting, gruesome scenes. Much of their impact comes from the fact that the opening scene is of a fierce battle and one of the very last shows Lincoln sombrely and respectfully riding on horseback through the trenches piled with bloodied,tragically youthful bodies.Lincoln tells a perfectly immersive dramatic story, but it is a story, not really history, and it's important to remember that this is largely an opportunity to display Spielberg's dramatic flair (especially with a very affecting portrayal of Lincoln's assassination), and the prowess of countless veteran actors (most especially the remarkably versatile and committed Daniel Day-Lewis as the great president, and also Tommy Lee Jones at his most effectively sour-faced), with some added political reality to strengthen the piece, but not ground it too solidly.",8,1,3,31 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Incredible adaptation, the best yet!
","There is no earlier Harry Potter film that can better this. From the beginning to the end the spectacle, suspense and excitement never stops. All the characters are at their best and the new director has given the film a special emotional touch.Harry Potter (Daniel Radliffe) is now in his fifth year and facing more difficulties than ever before. He is nearly expelled when he performs the Patronus charm to defend himself from an attacking dementor. While Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) are making his life miserable he is rescued by the secret organisation known as the Order of the Phoenix. Among them are Alastor Moody, (Brendan Gleeson) Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) and Harry's godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman.) When he thankfully arrives at school he finds that the ministry has planted an undercover worker Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher and the high inquisitor. This horrible woman devastates the students and the teachers including Professors Albus Dumbledore, (Michael Gambon) Minerva McGonagall, (Maggie Smith) Sybil Trelawney, (Emma Thompson) Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and even Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) with her numerous rules and cruel teaching style. So a group of students including Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) have formed a club to b e taught Defence against the Dark Arts properly by Harry. When they hear that the that the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his death eaters including Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) and Sirius' cousin Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) are planning to break into the ministry of magic their skills are put to the test as they fly over to stop them.The film also includes spectacular visual effects and the tragic but mysterious death of a main character. Directed by David Yates and co-starring Mark Williams and Julie Walters.",10,0,1,14 March 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Comfortably forgoes being a masterpiece to instead deliver softer and more accessible entertainment
","Here in the latest Tim Burton extravaganza, a greatly anticipated event, we see the exciting overlap of two very interesting journeys.Lewis Carroll's famous novel has been adapted several times in the many years since its first publication. Among these interpretations are the delightfully quirky television adaptation in 1999 – with an all-star cast including Martin Short and Miranda Richardson – and the childishly submissive Disney cartoon version in 1951.Though Burton's take on the classic tale is notably divergent from the others, and a splendid addition wealth of psychedelic triumphs. His trail of achievements is very often spoken of and highly praised. He has experimented with many genres, and it is a pleasure to see him try his hand at winsome frivolous fantasy-adventure.However, the reception of this film has been rather dismal, because this is also undoubtedly more commonplace than most of his other works. Rather than simply retelling an already well-known and fully comprehended story, and one that Burton believed to be very disjointed anyway with its unintelligible jumble of isolated episodes, a smoother and later-occurring narrative has been created in its place. This story might undeniably be the typical tale of courage, good and evil, rebellion, and overcoming obstacles against all odds, but it is still such a winner, even if it drags on at times as though its audience is clueless as to its conclusion.Thankfully though, all is agreed that the technical aspects are genius. Burton favourite Danny Elfman provides yet another commendable musical score, and the big man has fun with the special effects team in designing the mystical world of Underland through stunning scenery created with CGI and digital tweaking of some of the actors' faces.And indeed, what an impressive selection of stars the cast is.Australian newcomer Mia Wasikowska is most convincing in the title role. In this version Alice is a young lady of nineteen, and she is under enormous pressure to quickly make tough life-changing decisions. This is all depicted in a pleasingly worthwhile first couple of sequences. It is when the stress overwhelms her that she pursues the iconic tardy, smartly-dressed white rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen) down the hole and into Wonderland. However, the incredible universe from her childhood is hardly a refuge, as once she enters she finds herself in the heavily demanding position of 'Chosen One', as proclaimed by the all-knowing caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman).Burton's wife, the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter, is stupendously nasty in the role of the hideous tyrant the Red Queen. This monster has enslaved the land with her vicious pet the Jabberwocky (voiced briefly by horror legend Christopher Lee, also something of a Burton regular), the beast that Alice must slay.Crispin Glover emits menace and spite as the Red Queen's ruthless Knave of Hearts, her right-hand man and a vile sycophant; and the charming Anne Hathaway has fun playing her sweet and ditsy sister the White Queen, who leads the force of good.And lastly, Burton's most famous muse, the immensely talented Johnny Depp, shines in the role of the Mad Hatter, performing with great energy and impact. A slight yet distinct Capt. Jack Sparrow flair comes through at times with this wacky yet wise and noble character, and his presence hugely elevates his scenes.In short, Alice in Wonderland comfortably forgoes being a masterpiece to instead deliver softer and more accessible entertainment.",8,1,5,12 March 2010
Avatar," Over-hyped, but still mildly entertaining.
","After his previous, ground-breaking feature 'Titanic' (1997) director James Cameron has returned to playing things safe and by the rules.'Avatar' is a nice pastime, though it will not amaze you. Its premise is very familiar, and it takes the audience nowhere new, but still to places they like. It also seems to enjoy monkeying about with huge issues, concepts and themes, such as genocide and religion, though there is nothing depicted here that we haven't seen done before, and done better.Even its visuals – which are supposed to be the film's crowning glory – are immensely overrated, and however splendid they may be, they have been outdone time and again by the greats (Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Robert Zemeckis, Baz Lhurmann, Steven Spielberg, Jim Henson...). After all, when has CGI ever stood a chance against puppetry and stop-motion animation? A dimension is added by the stunning 3D, but a dimension is taken away by the paper-thin, unsustainable plot.Nevertheless, it still manages to be entertaining and frequently rather affecting, but it's excruciatingly slow-moving for an action film and surprisingly ordinary for the highest-grossing film in cinema history.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang try their hardest not be outdone by colourful trees, unintentionally hilarious digital monsters and blue-skinned, elf-like Aborigines.",6,3,6,29 January 2010
The Artist," An earnest piece of innovative cinema
","I will admit that at times I approach a classic silent film with a slight bit of reluctance. Some might find the little quirks of the grainy, blotchy film reels from which it has been garnered part of their charm and the historical experience, but realistically, I find it quite distracting when trying to genuinely lose myself in the film. The same goes to the richly textured black and white aesthetic and the absence of synchronised sound; sometimes I just feel trapped in a prison of deafness and colour blindness, and I feel that I will go mad if I don't see colour or hear an environmental sound very soon. I also get tired of watching hyperactive characters that look and sound like circus clowns bumbling around scary cardboard cut-outs as instruments of a very cheesy plot.Although, given the period, these aspects that would now be considered deficiencies can be forgiven and enable us to appreciate the film for what it is. However, the idea of such a film being made in contemporary times seems very silly and self-indulgent, an expectation that was fulfilled entirely in all its second-rate glory with Dr Plonk (2007). As this year's The Muppets and Hugo have shown us, what works with a revival of an old genre of franchise is to embrace the past while still acknowledging the future.Yes, The Artist is certainly a silent film, but it doesn't try to fool us into thinking that it was in the '20s. Many traditional conventions are used, but French writer/director Michel Hazanavicius doesn't restrict himself to them. The film is a reflection of the era, and focuses mainly on its dying days. The death of silent films was, of course, the talkies, which came gawkily at the beginning of the 30s, violently uprooting old luminaries such as our main character and taking at least a couple of years to find its own footing.Our protagonist is the cocky and charismatic megastar George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who is as French as his name would suggest, but since voice was then irrelevant in a screen actor's bank of skills, his foreign accent is in no way an inhibition for him in Hollywood as it was tragically for Bela Lugosi just a decade afterwards. He frequently milks his applause at film premier's pushing aside his disgruntled co-star Constance (Missi Pyle) and casually disregarding the feelings of his long-suffering wife (Penelope Ann Miller) by flirting and giggling with his female fans: but it's all good comical fun at least for the audience. As one can imagine, he is coasting along well until the industry suddenly veers off into territory that he is unable to walk on.Acclaimed film critic David Stratton described the plot as 'part Singin' in the Rain and part A Star is Born' which is quite true, but only on the most superficial level. After the beginning of the sound movement, the cheery laughter goes out with a bang as Valentin views on of Constance's sound tests and takes it to be a joke, but as soon as the austere studio executive Al Zimmer (John Goodman) declares 'This isn't a joke! This is the future!' the gags are reduced to a scant serving of ironic chuckles and we see a downsized Valentin plummet into a bottomless pit of despair and disillusionment. He doesn't just struggle to make the transition; the change has thrown him into a miserable exile. Meanwhile, the lively Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) a hapless and helplessly devoted old fan is taking a piece of Valentin's guidance to make herself the flourishing It girl of the new age, making cavalier comments to the press on the previous era that are similar to my complaints made in the opening paragraph. The timeless question of whether to judge people on their actions or the intentions behind them is then added to the melancholy world of the redundant cultural has-been that makes this a truly meaningful piece.David also said 'it's a real feel-good movie', which is partly true, but again only if one looks at the light-hearted, carefree beginning, the uplifting ending, and the loyal little dog that does the cute tricks that everyone is always talking about. I could go on quoting from that episode of At the Movies, but perhaps I should stop here. They said many things that I don't agree with, for even though the three of us would give the film the same rating, we all apparently liked it for quite different reasons. I admired the creativity of the silent film that is about silent movies, and the clever and rather bold use of synchronised sound in some parts to show the changing times and attitudes.Our enthusiastic cast features an eye-catching display of familiar faces and proved talent trying something new. However, John Goodman, James Cromwell and Malcolm McDowell aren't here to dominate the picture as a cowardly insurance policy. Arguably, the only safe route taken by this picture is the upbeat ending and the adorable dog, the rest is quite bold and ambitious. The film ultimately belongs to its splendid French leads, who exude a natural nostalgic charm as though they've always been silent film stars, and thrive on the freedom that the absence of spoken dialogue gives them. It is a shock to hear Dujardin's strikingly European accent at the very end, for at that point we had for some time stopped seeing him as a French man, and simply thought of him as a man. Hopefully, that will ensure that he nabs this year's Oscar for best actor.",9,10,19,17 February 2012
Up," Remembering its genre, it is a remarkable achievement.
","When Pixar first introduced the concept of purely computer-generated feature films, little did they know that they had created a ravaging ravenous monster that only they – and DreamWorks – would be able to tame. Forgetting that Pixar's philosophy has always been that you should always take time and care when working with this technique and that storyline was absolutely paramount, other companies gave in to the temptation to exploit the revolution and whip up several second-rate CGI flicks that were so enticingly easy and inexpensive to make.Computer animation has almost driven quality children's animation to extinction. It has been the death of cartoons, and the decline of claymation. Though the two aforementioned animation giants have thankfully managed to continue producing such wonderful specimens as 'Toy Story' (1995) and 'Shrek' (2001). The last fourteen years have taught us that only these two companies can manage to get it right, that only they can tame the monster.Now Pixar's offerings did falter after 2004, but they regained their footing last year with Wall-E and have sustained that success with Up, an exhilarating yet also deeply moving film. It tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Jeremy Leary at the beginning, but mostly by an amazing Edward Asner) a man who dreamed of adventure as a boy, a passion that saw him meeting and later marrying the sweet Ellie (voiced quite well by Ellie Docter, the director's daughter). The two share a long and beautiful marriage in a cosy little house that the couple decorated together, but after many years Ellie dies in hospital next to a very broken-hearted Carl. Though after her death Carl holds on relentlessly to their house and all of his photos and memories of her, he also goes on to attempt to fulfil her childhood dream which was to have a house in a lost land in South America.The story of his marriage is told quickly and with little dialogue, though still with much grace and emotion. This is of course so the exciting adventure he embarks on – which involves him taking off in a house tied to a million balloons – can be given most of the screen time, as it is more of a crowd-pleaser. Though the winsome themes are not forgone at that point, and more depth and more fun arrive when we are introduced to young 'wilderness explorer' Russell (voiced perfectly by Jordan Nagai) a naive and extremely animated boy who ends up tagging along to assist the elderly Carl.There is also a villain thrown in – perhaps unnecessarily, though he does give us a fair bit of enjoyment and is a major supplier of the story's complications – with his own story that is first mentioned and begun to be told at the beginning, and waits in the wings until near the end where he reappears and starts being nasty to the two heroes. He is explorer Charles Muntz (voiced splendidly by Christopher Plummer) who surprisingly is Carl's childhood hero, a ruthless tyrant obsessed with hunting down, killing, and taking back the strange bird-like creature that stalks these lands in order to prove he has seen it and has made it to the lost land.Remembering its genre, it is a remarkable achievement and one that reassures us that Pixar is still the best. It even manages to surpass Wall-E, which very visibly tried too hard to incorporate meaningful messages and to be a masterpiece. Although it succeeded, it didn't do so anywhere near as naturally and effortlessly as Up did.",9,2,4,27 September 2009
Les Misérables," Incredible screen adaptation of one of the greatest of all musicals
","The story of Legendary French author Victor Hugo's classic novel Les Misérables is one of those complex, epic timeless tales that instantly inspire and captivate the reader's imagination, even if the text itself is rather impenetrable and dizzyingly dense. A faithful stage or screen adaptation can often introduce a literary masterpiece to a wider audience, which is what Claude-Michel Schönberg's and Alain Boublil's hit musical achieved so well in the 1980s. It was one of those incredibly rare musicals like Chicago and Wicked! in which the songs were actually devoted to telling an interesting story.Quite riskily, virtually every line of the piece is sung, but only occasionally does it feel excessive and laughable. If its sensitive director, Tom Hooper, had taken the easy way and pre-recorded all of that dialogue, I'm sure this cinematic adaptation would have been horribly jerky and unconvincing. His much-publicised decision to record the singing live takes the film to the other extreme. It is incredibly refreshing to hear raw, real singing coming through the surround sound and to look into the eyes of the cast and believe that its actually coming the characters mouths at that moment.And what a fine cast it is. Led Australian actor-singers Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe, who occupy the most screen time and whose characters carry between them the films catalytic conflict, they are an altogether truly impressive assembly of talented luminaries and unknowns. Jackman plays the chief protagonist, Jean Valjean, a convict sentenced to 19 years of hard labour for the petty crime of stealing a loaf of bread in order to save his sick niece. Crowe plays the stalwart Inspector Javert, who sees the law as the only morality, and all its offenders as irredeemable.Once Valjean is finally released, Javert and the black mark on Valjean's papers constantly prevent the penniless man from finding any work, and legally earning any income. As Jean Valjean is a poor man, a suspicious convict, a filthy gutter rat, one of the many downtrodden misérables that the film centres on. So he defiantly and proactively establishes a new identity with the help of a priest who teaches him kindness and forgiveness through demonstration. As Monsieur le maire, a wealthy businessman, he applies his insider's knowledge of the world of poverty, the priest's lessons, and a newfound trust in god, to help scores of unfortunates for the remainder of his life, even as his obsessed pursuer, Javert, who never shows any signs of learning anything from these demonstrations of mercy, as that would mean acknowledging shades of grey in his safely black-and-white world.Both actors are surprisingly very convincing in their roles. Jackman has never looked so ragged and earthy, and his singing talents have never been put to better use. Crowe never reverts to his rock background during his many fine musical moments, and delivers a very compelling performance of a more internally tormented and trapped character.Of the well-known supporting actors, Anne Hathaway, as the good-hearted Fantine, gives perhaps the most affectingly raw performance of the entire film. The more tortured, dishevelled, and wretched she becomes for the sake of her ailing baby daughter, Cosette, the more the often herself misused actress shows us what she's capable of. Her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream, the climax of her involvement in the film, is utterly heartbreaking and completely different to all other versions of the song, as it is acted as much as it is sung, melting our hearts with the words as much as with the notes.At the other end of the scale, prolific actors Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen recapture their theatrical exuberance from Sweeney Todd as the comedic villains Mr & Mrs Thénardier, a slimy pair of costumed thieves who are, in their own way, as money-grubbing as the aristocrats who are about to meet their end in the French Revolution. It is a welcome pleasure to see these two experts doing what they do best in the moments where a bit of darkly comic relief is needed amidst the sweeping drama.As the children of the street who fall prey to these two grimy, over- charging innkeepers, a host of young newcomers proudly display their fine acting and singing talents. 10-year-old Isabelle Allen is most endearing and sweet-sounding as the gentle Cosette, as is 22-year-old Samantha Barks as the noble Éponine, who quietly endures being part of a painful love triangle; but most astonishing is the 13-year-old Daniel Huttlestone as the plucky young Gavroche, the paupers' revolution's fiercest and courageous orator who forces the ignorant aristocrats to look upon the real face of the empire that mollycoddles them.Gavroche proudly stands beside the young freedom-fighters of the revolution that is still incomplete as the film closes, but whose seeds have well and truly been sown. American actor Aaron Tveit is the last of the standouts as the movement's most fervent advocate. Even though Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne received billing for their respective roles as the adult Cosette and her love interest, the revolution's technical leader. Although Seyfried is a proved singer with a beautiful voice, and Redmayne isn't bad himself, their characterisations are rather bland, aside from his truly touching rendition of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.Watching this magnificent epic on screen, one wonders whether it might be even grander live on stage, with the present immediate energy of an in-the-flesh performance. However, cinema brings its own unique qualities to the piece. It enables smothering, intimate close-up, that Hooper makes good use of, and the actors are big enough to withstand. It also allows for a larger chorus, more complete set pieces, cross-cutting quartets and endless repeat viewings and showings to children and grandchildren alike far beyond the lifetimes of the cast and crew of this truly remarkable and almost flawless film.",9,1,2,5 January 2013
In Time," One of the better science fiction movies to attempt to be political
","Fourteen years after the well-received Gattaca (1997) Oscar-nominated director Andrew Niccol has made a triumphant return to futuristic science fiction to show the countless other filmmakers who have tried their hand at this notorious genre how it should be done. Once again, he manages to create both a highly fascinating world as well as some engaging characters to populate it and a stimulating plot on which its fine conception is not wasted. In this vision of the future, it appears that scientists may have finally discovered the age-old secret of eternal life, and have been putting it into practice on globally. People now theoretically have the power to control the duration of one's bodily existence down to the very last second, being able to continue topping up lifespans for as long as they please. What's more, the aging process has been genetically engineered to stop in everyone at the the age of 25. However, happy dreams of being forever young are but a fairytale: 'for a few to be immortal, many must die' or overpopulation would ensue. The government's solution has been to make time the new currency, with people walking around with a luminescent countdown on their forearm showing them exactly how much of it they have left, and minutes, hours, days, months or even years being talked about as casually as if they were soulless pieces of metal and paper. It also ensures that longevity will be exclusive to the rich in this cutthroat economy where it's quite literally 'survival of the fittest'. 'Darwinian capitalism' is what they call it, 'the next stage in human evolution'. It certainly isn't fair, and it doesn't work either. Some members of the upper-class have been living for over a century, with still many more centuries under their belt, and one in particular, named has learnt the hard way that the mind may continue to rot and deteriorate even if the body remains fit and healthy. Therefore, being completely psychologically spent, he transfers all of his years to a spirited but struggling youth from the slums, after being assured that he would put it to good use. Initially he plans to use it to fulfill the well-deserved desires of his dear mother, but after she tragically dies as a result of the corrupt economy raising the price of daily living once again, he instead decides to pose as a wealthy citizen and infiltrate the mansion of a spinelessly immoral billionaire and whisk his daughter away on a righteous crusade to raid the time banks and hand out to the poor all the time that has been kept from them by merciless government agents known as 'time keepers'.As is the case with many celebrated futuristic films and novels, many parallels can be drawn to societies at the other end of the time scale. This gives the story a dual sense of the retrospective and the ultra- modern both being present at once, like the 'future noir' cinematic style introduced by Blade Runner (1982) and may even extend to highlighting historical patterns or cycles such as the book within the book in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Watching the dynamic duo fearlessly break into government institutions and return with something to provide the less fortunate with hope and stability, bringing balance to the uneven and unjustly feudalistic distribution of wealth and power, one is reminded of timeless idolised rebellious figures such as the fabled Robin Hood, the suave John Dillinger and the enigmatic Ned Kelly who engaged in similar activities and whose stories have given valuable inspiration to filmmakers. If not on the outset, then definitely at the slick and stylish ending, the political message is made loud and clear, with the film still managing to be engaging and inviting throughout whilst diminishing none of its thematic power. Some films depicting a dystopian future are so static and depressing that they fail to capture the audience's attention, with the perfectly valid underlying meaning being lost to miscommunication and poor execution, but the frivolous and refreshing tone of this film generously allows the audience to have some fun as they absorb the message, making it more likely for it to be understood and retained. After all 'a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down'. A world populated only by twenty-five-year-olds is bursting with liveliness and adventure despite the misery, and our very likable heroes have a winsome aura of invincibility about them that comforts the audience and fills them with optimism, just as they do for all those citizens who have been unfairly treated.The design of the characters works splendidly well. The role of our spunky lead hero, Will Sallas, is handled very competently by Justin Timberlake, who it seems is on his way to becoming a full-time actor. A barely recognisable Amanday Seyfried just as capably takes on her role as Sylvia Weis, the plucky rich girl who has been living a very sheltered life, but is very quick to realise the reality of the world's situation and embrace the hard life that she and Will must lead. Inevitably, the two characters share an impulsive romance, but Niccol wisely doesn't let this get in the way of the main plot and keeps the focus on their connection as rogues rather than lovers.In addition to these major aspects, the film is also peppered with countless delightful quips and memorable quirky moments that enjoy the potential humour of this world. Perhaps the most notable of these is an early scene in which Sylvia's father (a perfectly cast Vincent Kartheiser) introduces Will to his mother-in-law, his wife and his daughter, who all look exactly the same age.Also featuring fine supporting performances from Olivia Wilde, Matt Bomer, Cillian Murphy, Alex Pettyfer, Yaya DaCosta, and Johnny Galecki, In Time makes for stupendously entertaining and very rewarding viewing.",8,1,10,31 October 2011
Burlesque," Somewhere between Chicago and High School Musical
","After a lonely, lowly, spirited amateur dancer defiantly discards her mundane life in Iowa in search of a more exciting existence pursuing her stage talents, she stumbles across a sensually stylish yet struggling Burlesque club in Los Angeles. Struck immediately by its raunchy grandeur and by the promises it holds for an aspiring performer such as herself, she strives relentlessly to become one of its members. Director Steve Antin handles these early developments with more subtlety and believability than is the norm for films with similar plot lines, allowing us to see the things from the protagonists point of view whilst also comfortably accepting that we may not wish to feel the same way about it, seeing as we have only just been introduced to the girl. As she ventures into this corner of showbiz our mindsets are naturally entwined with hers. Together we encounter the various colourful characters of the club, and see the way they are all either a help, a hindrance or a bystander during her climb from being a simple waitress thanks to the help of a spunky, good-hearted bartender, to becoming their main attraction thanks in part to the clumsy sabotaging of a clearly incompetent rival. The aforementioned depictions, making up the first part of the film, are most definitely a lush and exciting piece of work, densely endowed with engaging and involving occurrences, finely crafted scenes of dialogue and sprinklings of tuneful glamour and romantic decadence. After this it then proceeds in a less fulsome, but still entertaining fashion, focusing mainly on the love life of the girl, named Ali, and the dramas involved in the club's financial problems. In the end this subject matter proves to be considerably less sustainable than that explored earlier, and consequently, the musical aspect it turned up a notch, and the numbers grow in frequency and extravagance. Yet despite the thinness and tackiness, the later scenes do still carry that same undeniable charm and emotional value seen before, and so you feel you just have to love this film no matter what, and the explosive toe-tapping finale is very satisfying. So despite the obvious wantonness, memorability and fun is always ensured by the film's much more prominent merits: stupendous songs, the gorgeous visual package, the attractive premise, and of course the well- oiled cast, in which Christina Aguilera, Cam Digandet, Cher and Stanley Tucci are especially brilliant. In short, Burlesque is on feeling a masterpiece, but on reflection a misfire: the point being that if you don't overthink it you'll have the time of your life.",7,4,4,31 January 2011
August Rush," Fabulous film featuring fabulous Freddie.
","Director Kirsten Sheriden and screenplay writers Paul Castro, Nick Castle and James.V.Hart have succeeded with flying colours in delivering a poignant and captivating real life tale that possesses a beautiful feeling of magic without  most astonishingly  the aid of a novel.The awe-inspiring Freddie Highmore (from stunning successes such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Arthur and the Invisibles and this year's The Golden Compass) brings his charming essence to the film as he devotedly plays the title character  an audiophile with whom we can all relate. Eleven-year-old August can realise beauty in every sound he hears and believes that: 'Music is all around us. All you have to do is listen.' With this unique philosophy and strong passion he could well become the greatest musician in the world. But sadly our delightful young hero has spent all his life in a strict, ramshackle orphanage that maliciously tries to prevent a single spark of hope or desire from flourishing.Then one fateful day he is gently talked into escaping the harsh and horridly restraining prison and follows the path of sound. Along the way he is helped by the faithful church community and steered of course by a cold greedy villain who calls himself 'Wizard' (the wonderful Robin Williams) into a gang of unruly, street type buskers but even so he moves on in the hope of at last finding his long lost mother (Kerri Russell) and father (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who aren't doing too well either.With its entrancing all-star cast and a firm command over its audience's heart and mind it's no surprise that this majestic masterpiece is an academy award nominee.

","A swift, atmospheric prologue opens this immersive film version of the identically named 70s television series, where the legacy of the influential English Collins family is briefly introduced, and our impossibly likable hero Barnabas (Johnny Depp) is soon pushed to the forefront as the one who is to take up their great industrial and social mantle connected with their life-giving fishing company in America, their new place of settlement. Despite his noble intentions, his downfall begins with an unfortunate momentary fling with a pretty servant girl, Angelique (Eva Green) who he quickly draws away from when she hungrily takes the affair too seriously and starts demanding passionate declarations of love from him. The delicate Josette (promising newcomer Bella Heathcote) is his true love, but he remarks that of all lusty servant girls he had run afoul with a ferocious witch, who covertly kills her and his parents and imprisons him as a vampire in a shackled coffin as eternal punishment.Although the romance is simplistically convincing, screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith knowingly glosses over this familiar narrative element and instead devotes his time to the twisted obsessive yet hate-filled sexual relationship between the hero and villain, and various symbols of superficiality, murder, betrayal, honour, monstrosity and oppression. As John August's story continues along an equally familiar route, in which Barnabas is inadvertently freed by construction work two centuries later, and must confront the miserable wreckage of the Collins' glorious mansion, family and business, these elements lift it beyond the usual fish-out-of-water comedy and give it raw significance.Pleasingly to all of his fans, the latest feature from acclaimed experimentally and uncommonly imaginative – or 'weird' to slothful critics – director Tim Burton is a very successful marriage of his closely held macabre, supernatural storytelling with the more widely popular character comedy genre. Much of the humour is blackened and maintains our sympathy with the loveably bumbling, old-fashioned Barnabas when his wretched curse compels him to devour innocent victims, and he resorts to hypnosis in his progress in assisting his struggling modern relations and warding off the persistent Angelique, who now heads a rival fishing company and continues to torpedo the Collins family in frustration.Green is sensationally sinister and succulent as the complex femme fatale, and Depp delivers another indescribably perfect unique characterisation. I've purposely omitted details of the rest of the ensemble, because their introductions are much more gradual and imbedded into the narrative than those met during the speedy expositional opening, so enjoy the surprises in store. Among them are a few of Burton's talented group of old friends. Michelle Pfeiffer relishes another fantastical characterisation and makes a welcome return after her stunning turn as Catwoman in Batman Returns (1992). There's always room for a cameo from horror legend Christopher Lee, and he joins his good friend for the sixth time (he's provided the voice of his old, beloved Dracula for Frankenweenie, along with old hands Martin Landau, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder, which opens later this year). Burton's remarkably skilled wife, Helena Bonham Carter, joyfully joins her husband for a seventh time, even though her performance here might not be as effective as Depp's, as his Mad Hatter was against her Red Queen in Burton's last feature Alice in Wonderland (2010), her presence is still an asset to the picture, and fans will surely share in some inside jokes between her and the ultimate Burton regular, now on his eighth collaboration, after the quirky pair of muses co-star together for the fifth time. Combing through the credits, one can spot numerous other familiar faces in other departments, most notably his zany maestro Danny Elfman.Dark Shadows is one of those rare mainstream films that practise their own morals. It never tries to command the feelings of the audience, a characteristic of its villain that it righteously condemns; any sadness is felt only in moments of genuine pathos, and the audience may choose which characters they rejoice with. Some, if desired, may simply and easily enjoy the slick farce at a comfortable distance, for, despite its budget, it is, at its core, a humbly brilliant film.",9,3,6,9 June 2012
Inception," See it for the intrigue, the effects and the incomparable dynamics of Cotillard, Di Caprio and all the others.
","Christopher Nolan's ambitious latest project Inception has bravely arrived on the back of his hugely successful previous project 'The Dark Knight' (2008) sensationally undeterred by the ensuing sky-high expectations, but perhaps its timing isn't quite as troublesome as one might think. Dark Knight was ultimately the typical superhero mélange single-handedly heaved to greatness by a mind-blowing Heath Ledger who nobody else could keep up with, in more ways than one: it was a vehicle for an exceptional talent rather than a legendary masterpiece in itself; whereas Inception has all senses engaged and all aspects finely tuned.The lush smorgasbord of rich themes infinitely beguiling concepts – dreams, memory, thoughts and feelings and other psychological notions – provide a highly engaging premise for a film that is unlike any other. Of course, as in all big-budget blockbusters, larger than life action sequences abound like huge flashy bedazzling numbers in a musical. Also like the songs in a tuneful stage show, a few of them are unwelcome, and many of the later climactic displays of spectacle are painfully long for the audience's attention span: but slackening the pace in this manner is mostly beneficial, giving us time to contemplate and comprehend the great jigsaw puzzle that is the plot.Amidst the surreal swirl of slightly sci-fi-esquire ideas, a handful of pleasingly memorable characters shape a respectably well-conceived story. Leonardo Di Caprio stars as Agent Cobb, a world-weary and suspiciously enigmatic man who is desperate to complete a job in order to go home to his dearly missed children; the job falls into place in the category of the strangest kind of espionage: dream invasion. The reason for his puzzling particularly secretive nature appears to be connected to his eerily mysterious late wife Mal (a stunningly disturbing Marion Cotillard) whose ghostly memory makes recurring appearances in the dreams he enters. Di Caprio is joined by a splendid ensemble of mostly unrecognised actors – most notably Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt – who play his trusted colleagues in this rather insane endeavour.See it for the intrigue, the effects and the incomparable dynamics of Cotillard, Di Caprio and all the others.",8,3,6,13 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," A sheer delight, full of laughs, thrills, and a heap of fun.
","Guy Ritchie's take on the classic stories from Arthur Conan Doyle is most pleasurable, taking place in a perfectly captured atmospheric old London setting.It sees well-known characters Sherlock Holmes (a masterful Robert Downey Jr.) and his partner Dr. John Watson (a very winsome Jude Law) facing a whole host of foes and challenges.Watson is set to marry the lovely Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), an idea that Holmes is unsettled by, but this is the least of his problems.The dark and mysterious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong makes the most of his screen time, being even more sinister than he was in Stardust) is terrorising the town, claiming to be an immortal sorcerer who will cause unimaginable destruction unless parliament succumbs to his rule.An inept and corrupt police force, led by the awful Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) is constantly getting in Holmes' way, and there are some among them who have loyalty to Blackwood.Though undeniably their greatest obstacle is the beautiful but sneaky Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams at her most alluring) who shares an infatuation with Holmes, yet Blackwood also has a hold on her.The action sequences are gratifyingly modest and therefore much more engaging, involving only the conflicts of a few characters.What is also admirable is the fact that it is made easy to follow despite the audience not being as sharp-eyed and ingenious as Holmes The cast is absolutely sensational, including the supporting actors that include Robert Maillet and James Fox. McAdams and Strong have an enormous impact with their marvellously theatrical performances, while Law and Downey Jr. play their parts with a forceful and effective subtlety that is even better.The film is a sheer delight, full of laughs, thrills, and a heap of fun.",8,0,0,29 January 2010
WALL·E," Beautifully made, but not a whole lot there in the way of enjoyment.
","Whenever one thinks of animation, one always thinks of the legendary Walt Disney Company. It was Walt who first introduced animation into the fascinating world of cinema with his world renowned landmark masterpiece 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937.) This timeless classic was followed by over thirty more delightful pencil animation creations throughout the rest of the twentieth century. But after the death of the big man in 1966 and their last decent offering 'The Emperor's New Groove' (2000) it seemed that the king had run out of fresh ideas and so  in order to maintain their reputation  clung to the newly formed Pixar for dear life.Pixar's first full-length CGI motion picture 'Toy Story' (1995)  like Snow White  revolutionised the world of animation and was incredibly well-received by both critics and audiences world-wide. Most of the other creations that we have seen in the last decade have been just as enjoyable, but the more recent releases such as  'Cars' (2006) and 'Ratatouille' (2007)  indicated that the new ruler was starting to decline just as the mouse company had.However, in the sci-fi romance Wall-E we can certainly see a vast improvement and a new hope. The animation is stunning  no surprises there  and the plot is both original and diverting. However most notably, the characters are much simpler than those of the previous Pixar films and yet they captivate you like no poignant adult drama hero or heroine could ever do. The title character  the last of the Waste Allocation Lift Loader, Earth-Class robots who were sent down to Earth to clean up the huge overload of human waste  is a sweet, tender little thing who will surely touch your heart. His shiny, high-tech girlfriend Eve startles poor Wall-E when on their first meeting, but as the story progresses the two form a beautiful friendship and she begins to feel as deeply for him as we do. The third-most-important character is the slightly imbecilic captain of the space ship built to house the humans until the Earth is once again inhabitable and they can return. The humans of this time  which is roughly seven hundred years from now  live in an artificial, ultra-modern simulation of Earth and are heavily reliant on technology to do just about everything for them. After centuries of living this way the humans have evolved into fat, lazy monsters that can't even walk anymore.The latest Pixar flick might only barely shine a light on the likes of 'Monsters Inc.' (2001) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003)  the main flaw of this film is that Wall-E keeps almost dying, we all know they wouldn't have the heart to kill him off - but otherwise it is an excellent recovery and a delight to watch. But who do we have to thank for it? Obviously the director Andrew Stanton, the story creator Pete Doctor and the screenplay writer Jim Reardon for coming up with the general imaginative concept of man's dominance leading to such a disaster  but who else? We do have Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight providing the occasional 'Wall-E!' and 'Eve!' from the two main characters, Jeff Garlin as the voice of the Captain and the celebrity voices Kathy Najimy, Sigourney Weaver, John Ratzenberger, Fred Willard and Macln Talk in brief cameos. But the real power behind the mesmerising characters  who are the main life source of this film  is definitely the animators, who usually don't get nearly as much credit as they deserve.",7,0,3,1 March 2009
Mary and Max," An astonishing work of art
","Just as it seemed that with the fall (or at least the decline) of the two most distinguished entertainment industries in the history of animated films – The Walt Disney Company and DreamWorks Animation – The Tale of Despereaux would have to last us for generations, here emerged a most remarkable offering of quality and taste that wipes out the memory of the mouse's tale and smashes Bolt to smithereens. Oscar-winning stop-clay animation magician Adam Elliot has dived deep into his collection of childhood memories and plucked out the pieces of a most fascinating story. It is these mementos and recollections that form the basis of his script. It is a story of many things, one being the extraordinary friendship between the two pen pals of the film's title that arises purely by coincidence.Sweet little eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced splendidly by the carefully chosen Bethany Whitmore) lives in suburban Melbourne in the seventies with her inattentive and greatly flawed parents. Her mother (voiced superbly by Renée Geyer in one of the earlier scenes) is the most repulsive creature ever to walk the Earth. Apart from being a hideous old hag, a shifty shoplifter, a drunk, and a terrible smoke addict, she is a horrible mother who has hardly any love, care, or time for her daughter. Her father works at a teabag factory. For a hobby he stuffs dead animals he finds lying on the road, and when he is not working he sits in his shed with his revolting collection of preserved carcasses. He has even less time for Mary than her mother does, and the little screen time he is given is symbolic of his obscure involvement in Mary's upbringing. Poor Mary is also the subject of much torment at school due to the unsightly 'poo-coloured' birthmark on her forehead. Her self-made action figures are all the lonely girl has in this world. The pitiful Max (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is here absolutely outstanding) is in his early forties, and is equally as lonely as Mary. For a person with Asperger's Syndrome, New York is the worst place to live. As a result of his condition he is hypersensitive, clumsy, antisocial and absolutely bizarre to everyone else. Completely isolated socially from all humanity, he spends most of his time in his flat watching television and devouring one of his 'chocolate hotdogs' after another. The lengthy, detailed and unbelievably forthright letters that Mary receives from this genuinely good-hearted obese man are incredibly insightful and one of the finest aspects of the film. The touching tale is topped off with delightful narration by Barry Humphries and a fun sense of quirkiness as well as a dash of intelligent humour to avoid things from getting too depressing. The animation is unique and complementary to the story, with a purposeful lack of colour and lumpy appearance. Though the final scenes are a slight letdown in comparison to the charming first hour. The traumatic events that unfold after the final letter is sent to an elderly yet predominantly unchanged Max by a now successful, well-to-do and adult Mary (now voiced by Toni Collette) that apparently aggravates him, seem far too concocted to have been part of the true story upon which the film was based and vaguely even detract from the realism brought about by the earlier scenes. The many deaths however are for the most part believable and fittingly incorporated, but the inclusion of one or two of them seems questionable.",10,7,19,5 July 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Something for everyone
","One has to applaud the way the bold, ambitious Christopher Nolan so deftly answers the cries of both his discerning cinematically well- educated critics, who can praise his work as knowledgeable peers, and his eager layman audience that show him their innocent pleasures, and, more practically, provide him with funds. His films to date are surprisingly few, but undeniably memorable, and mostly large-scale, big- budget thrilling blockbusters boasting hefty themes and impressive star- studded line-ups, often including smooth screen favourite Michael Caine. All of them, from the frenetic Memento to the awe-inspiring Inception have been dramatically complex and thematically intriguing, whilst also containing enough thrills and excitement to hold the attention of masses of casual moviegoers and finance its grand production. He undoubtedly deserves to be one of the small handful of directors in the marquee.Batman has proved such perfect fit for him because he is also incredibly versatile. With the playfully eerie interpretation from Tim Burton in the 80s, and now Nolan's impressively believable and powerfully gritty take on the famous character, both drawing on the dark complexity of the mysterious caped crusader, this DC Comics character has proved to be the superhero for people who don't normally like superheroes.Batman Begins (2005) was emotionally arresting in its depiction of Bruce Wayne's slow transformation into the dark vigilante after his parents were destroyed in a struggle against Gotham's filthily corrupt engine of organised crime, and the even uglier League of Shadows built him up into a formidable fighter before he learned its true nature and turned against it. Bruce's malformed but solid grief-stricken heroic spirit, carried off so believably by Christian Bale, and the supernatural wonderment of Batman's powers were among the film's greatest strengths.However, in its sequel, The Dark Knight (2008), Batman's mystique had faded miserably, and Bale wandered dispassionately between playing a self-righteous entrepreneur and an expressionless, hoarse robotic boxer. That film was unquestionably dominated by Heath Ledger's entertainingly creepy and philosophically fascinating Joker, a characterisation that was so far ahead of the rest of the film that everything was thrown out of kilter.None of the characters in The Dark Knight Rises are on par with the Joker, but they're all splendid nonetheless, and the trilogy's closer is certainly more even-handed than its muddled middle instalment. It is a carefully constructed film that largely centres on despair and desperation, with Batman's self-imposed exile resulting in Bruce's as well, as we see just how reliant he is on his alter ego to give him purpose. His body, mind, social life and business have all become decrepit after eight years of neglect.This is, until a feisty, cunning jewel thief, the here unstated but unmistakable Catwoman (a surprisingly fierce Anne Hathaway) spurs him back into action once he discovers that she is stealing from him. The latest of her never-ending, socially irredeemable crimes are noticeably linked to that of the formidable Bane (an unrecognisable Tom Hardy) the brutal, muscle-bound terrorist we meet in the prologue in a similar fashion to our introduction to the Joker, although he is much less subtle and unpredictable. Somehow linked to the League of Shadows, Bane is not an independent anarchist, but a self-righteous dictator who believes the only way to be rid of corruption is to be rid of everything else in existence. He is a solid, intimidating tyrant who's razor-ship observations are articulated in and unnervingly evil voice distorted electronically to sound as otherworldly as the psychedelic tones of the Scarecrow (with whom Cillian Murphy makes another memorable appearance) and thankfully not too comically deep-sounding. He is convincingly indomitable, even if he is still scientifically as destructible as his foes, so much so that our beloved bat and cat are frequently made to seem powerless and insignificant, and their mortifying naivety is revealed.After the still tormented Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) is put out of action after a frightening encounter with him and his cronies in the sewer tunnels that no other policeman will be convinced of, plucky new Officer Blake (the charming Joseph Gordon-Levitt) appeals to Bruce to re-emerge and save the city, speaking to him as a fellow orphan. His loyal butler Alfred (Caine) fears that Bruce might morbidly relish the crisis as an opportunity to plunge himself into a danger that, on this occasion, seems greater than ever before, and it seems as though he might soon lose even his valued companionship.Amidst this richly textured realism, however, there are still the playful elements of its comic book origins. However long the complications might be shrouded in hopelessness, there are still ways for our heroes to prevail in the end. As seriously as we might take Bane, despite his cartoonish mask, he still gets to say 'impossible!' like so many villains before him when the good guys make a miraculous comeback. There's still a bomb that must be disarmed with barely a few seconds to go, and orphans, albeit less gratuitous ones, to save if this fails. At an extreme low point in the film, an unwelcome sudden divergence is made in the motives of an enigmatic, but ultimately uninteresting spare femme fatale with whom fine French actress Marion Cotillard tries to imbue the same eerie mystique possessed by her character in Inception (2010) but is constantly let down by the Nolan brothers' otherwise astutely written screenplay.Thank goodness that the rest of this 164-minute escapist masterpiece is so entrancing, and also buoyed by the exhilarating scoring from the great Hans Zimmer.",9,6,13,5 August 2012
Iron Man," Just like the others, so why even bother?
","Unlike that of a riveting masterpiece such as Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean, the title of this bland sci-fi action flick says it all. Indeed Iron Man is an offspring of SuperMAN, BatMAN Begins, SpiderMAN, CatwoMAN and various other members of the 'Man' family.But however run of the mill a film might be there will always be theatres that choose to show it. Though in this case it wasn't selected only because of the spiced up posters but because of its small but nevertheless existent DNA that slightly separates it from its relatives: the secret identity of the armour-clad flying and shooting rescuer (Robert Downey Jr.) is in no way heroic like all the other superheroes, but more an immature inventor largely annoyed at the publicity coming from his success who is nothing without the suit. But luckily for him his rivals that include foreign terrorists and his own sneaky bodyguard (Jeff Bridges) are equally as ordinary and - from an audience's perspective - are nothing to fear.But aside from those few aspects it consists of nothing but the usual cinematic performances, satirical humour and a dull story of spies, fiery deaths and high-tech gadgets that mindlessly dances around in a pathetic struggle to fill in time until the curtain falls. But I suppose without near failures like these we would not be able to fully appreciate breathtaking rebels like The Incredibles.",3,2,7,1 March 2009
Monsters University," Enjoyable enough prequel thats' not ruined by it's clichés
","Pixar's track record of sequels is undeniably superior to that of DreamWorks, Fox or any of its other competitors. Granted, this may be because Pixar hasn't made nearly as many sequels as other studios have, but that is arguably to its credit. Both of the Toy Story (1999 and 2010) sequels were more popular than their predecessors because they successfully drove the story forward with new characters, new ideas and new settings to justify its continuation. Cars 2 (2011) also presented something new with a big switch of protagonist and genre. However much this might have alienated fans of the original, at least it wasn't a re-hash, and some who were not fans of the first movie (like myself) relished the change. However, the emotional depth, conceptual maturity and memorable characters were undeniably absent.To some extent, these are present in Monsters University, an expansion of the beloved Monstropolis universe that is very wisely a prequel, showing how some of the key characters in Monsters, Inc. (2001) got to where they were at the beginning of the original, rather than a pointless, contrived continuation of a story that was very conclusively and gratifyingly resolved in the original film (which is the type of sequel that Finding Dory seems destined to be). The only downside to this decision is that it forces the writers to exclude the adorable Boo from the picture, but you can't have everything.As everyone knows, University shows how Mike and Sulley (who are of course voiced again by Billy Crystal and John Goodman) met at college, where Sulley was a big, confident top-dog and Mike was a small, shy, unpopular punching bag, and how they eventually became friends. However, the setup is not actually as simplistic as it might sound. Sulley is not a jock – there are indeed cookie-cutter, muscle-bound blockheads in this movie but Sulley is not one of them – he is a naturally terrifying scare student who plans to cruise through the course on instinctive ability and the reputation of his father, who we learn was also a top scarer. Mike is picked on and neglected for his size. He is a little kid with big dreams, but he is not just a male, monster version of Madeline. He is an intelligent, diligent, hard-working student who studies tirelessly and knows all the theory behind scaring, but, as he is told by his head professor, the supposedly terrifying Dean Hardscrabble (voiced with variable believability by Helen Mirren), 'what you lack simply cannot be taught. You're just not scary.' As a senior high school student, hopefully soon to be a university student, I can certainly relate to Mike's frustrations about Sulley's cavalier attitude and with his own unfair physical limitations. This character conflict is as meaningful and memorably mature as the environmental theme in the original movie.That said, this prequel has no shame in using hackneyed plot points and stereotypes. When both of our main characters are in danger of being cut from the scaring program, Mike for his lack of natural ability and Sulley for his lack of effort, the film devolves into a painfully familiar underdog story in which the two must rally together a team of nerdy, hardly scary social outcasts to somehow win the annual Scare Games and prove to the Dean that they belong in the program. These supporting characters do give us some good laughs, mostly through the loveably stereotypical mother of the youngest nerd, and sometimes even by subverting a few clichés, but even though they are at least more interesting than the jocks, we've come to expect better from a company that is always praised for its ingenious creativity and originality. Fortunately, some of the in-between teams are more inventive, namely a group of light-voiced cheerleaders that can pull out red-hot, sinister, serpentine stares on cue. There are a couple of good challenges, even though they are infused with the well-meaning but ultimately cloying moral messages of individuality and teamwork saving the day. The highlight is probably a game of capture the flag in the library with a truly terrifying and well-designed monstrous, slug-like librarian. Being a mostly physical character who is used sparingly, and voiced without the rather condescending regal refinement that Mirren's voice work brings, and which ultimately makes the character, who is fairly well-written as a discerning figure of authority, much less scary than the dramatic dialogue, camera angles and soundtrack insist that she is. The librarian scene, and the engaging earlier classroom scenes, are second only to a genuinely thrilling climax, one that actually manages to be the highpoint of the movie, that again sees Mike and Sulley trapped on the other side of a door to the deadly and dangerous human world. The movie's academic theme might not be relatable to the younger audience, but they will certainly enjoy these thrilling action sequences as much as the adults, and, if they've done the right thing and seen the first movie before going into this one, they will appreciate the generous serves of sly references to the original film. There are many of these in the end credits montage and surrounding the returning character of Randall (again voiced by Steve Buscemi, though not quite as enthusiastically as the first time round) the innocent freshman who we see slowly being developed into a vengeful villain.It goes without saying that the animation is top-notch – Pixar films have received all manner of theme-, character- and narrative-related criticisms, but never visual ones – and there is a low-key chase scene elongated purely for the purpose of showing off the animators' technical and creative skill, but while the rest of the film's strengths are enough to make it reasonably memorable as a prequel, they hardly warrant repeat viewings, and sometimes the references and reused musical themes from the original encourage a comparison to an engrossing animated masterwork that this affable nostalgic trip just can't withstand. Still, I'd recommend it.",6,1,8,11 July 2013
Toy Story 3," It warmed the cockles of my heart.
","In yet another triumph, Pixar has skillfully managed to break the curse of the second animated sequel, a pratfall that both DreamWorks and Twentieth Century Fox have succumbed to with 'Shrek the Third' (2007) and 'Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' (2009) respectively.A large part of this film's success of is fuelled by the timeless quality of the two earlier Toy Story films, an asset that is unfailingly retained in the third, as well as our joy in seeing the now very accomplished animation giant return to its humble roots. However, this doesn't seem to be enough, as a bountiful array of new themes, characters and plot devices have clearly been introduced in order to sustain the third installment: Andy (voiced by John Morris) is becoming distanced from his old plastic companions as he is reaching adulthood; the old toy gang has been heavily depleted over the time change, leaving only the principles remaining in Andy's room; the villains are more numerous, and all of them are toys that have been corrupted or mutated; Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen) has since the beginning become a hackneyed sentimentalist, and so is transformed into a childish gag for most of the film by having him malfunction – it's all still more than sufficient, but as with 'Wall-E' (2008) the feat is pulled off not quite as effortlessly as usual.While it has been a staggering ten years since 'Toy Story 2' (1999) the previous entry in the series, we realize that the fabulous star-studded voice cast, which also includes Tom Hanks and Joan Cusack, must have been quite a challenge to reassemble, and animation is indeed a very slow and painstaking process. Directed by Lee Unkrich and co-starring the voices of Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jodi Benson, Blake Clark, Estelle Harris and Ned Beatty, Toy Story 3 is definitely not a cheap re-hash of the others, but a serious contender for this year's Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film, an award that would sit well alongside those for Wall-E and last year's Up.",8,1,2,2 July 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Typical of an irrrelevant sequel...
","The concept of a 'trilogy' is usually best suited only to the genres of action, fantasy and sci-fi. Though in the last few years it has been tried with animated films, once with 'Shrek' (2001-2007) and now with Ice Age, and both of them have followed a remarkably similar path. In both cases: the filmmakers' entire heart, soul and creativity were poured into the first film, which was wonderfully fun, with a very meaningful centre; the second film was also quite enjoyable and exciting, with a script that showed an admirable yet failed attempt to again attain some depth; and the third has been utterly disgraceful and unbearably shallow with a slapdash script full of countless desperate attempts at witty humour that are mostly in vain, with only very few being successful.Amidst all the nigh intolerable madness, there is something of a plot, into which the writers have inelegantly implanted the theme of parenthood. Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) becomes anxious after hearing that his wife Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah) is about to give birth, and starts to hurriedly prepare himself for being a father. Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) has stumbled upon a clutch of unguarded and seemingly abandoned eggs and decides to take them into his care. When they hatch, he proceeds to raise the hatchlings as if they were his own despite having no idea what species they are.It is perfectly clear to the audience, however, that they are Tyrannosaurus Rex chicks, and after the angry mother takes both her chicks and Sid to her nest, the Manny, Ellie, and the others go after him into a very different world beneath the ice. They are lead by the new character, Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg).It is rather refreshing and exciting to have a change in setting from cold and wintry to warm, colourful and tropical. Though as it is so obviously 'inspired' by Journey to the Centre of the Earth we cannot give this film's creators any credit for that.Though the invention of our tough, fearless and delightful guide is, however, noteworthy. At least one fresh face was clearly needed here as the old characters have lost much of their charm. The annoying, bumbling daggy sloth is no longer amusing. The rickety relationship we saw between the two mammoths in the previous installment was much more interesting and believable than the sappy romance we see here. The possum brothers Crash (voiced by Sean William Scott) and Eddie (voiced by Josh Peck) are no longer mischievous and delightful, they are instead tiresomely idiotic. The character of Diego (voiced by Denis Leary) is at its least dynamic and he has very little to do in this film. Even Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge) the always reliable comic relief has every one of his scenes ruined by the presence of the less welcome newcomer Scratte (voiced by Karen Disher), though these writers are not the first to mistakenly try to assign a girlfriend to as many of the characters as possible.Despite the fact that a handful of the new characters (the chicks, their mother, and Buck's rival Rudy included) do not talk, they still manage to let be a letdown. The Tyrannosaurus family may be entertaining, but Rudy was one we, for most of the film, only heard the deafening roar of, heard stories about and saw the shadow of. This built up incredible suspense, as well as our expectations for a truly terrifying and nigh invincible monster. Though in the end, the beast was disappointingly easily beaten in an extremely short 'climax'.What had worked initially has obviously been forgone or overused now. If this is the last entry of the series and this is truly a sad end for Ice Age. Though better tragedy than bankruptcy, which is most likely what a fourth film would result in. Shrek Goes Fourth is now in the works, and this cannot end well for DreamWorks.",1,6,15,24 September 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," To be avoided at ALL costs
","Appalling ego-induced carelessness from director Wes Anderson, betrayal of the great Roald Dahl, and just sheer stupidity are present in the worst adaptation of Dahl's work since the abominable 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (1971).Those sensational chapters from the delightful children's story are simply glossed over quickly and emotionlessly.Instead, the enthusiasm has gone towards the pathetic and most unnecessary additions. It has also idiotically been filled with adult American sit-com-style humour – one can hardly think of anything more inappropriate for a Roald Dahl children's story. Such a sickening amount of time is wasted as numerous failed attempts are made to be sharp, witty and funny.The results are very lifeless and cynical and share 9's problems with narrative and audience.Yet despite all this it is somewhat enjoyable, and one cannot hate it entirely.This is most likely owing to the honest, home-style animation, which is by no means perfect as the work characters' facial expressions are downright awful, but it is definitely the best thing on offer here.Or perhaps it is the novelty of having a voice cast of well-known and well-loved actors – George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon... – but sadly most of them are underused, miscast, or just simply don't deliver.Bottom line: avoid this at all costs.",1,35,88,8 January 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," I can't believe this is the last Harry Potter review I'll ever get to write!
","Fifteen years of tireless, incredible hard work from some of the best of Britain's storytelling talent, supported by an equally faithful and eagerly devoted fan base, now culminates in the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Ever since the frothily juvenile but still undeniably good quality Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first hit cinema screens in 2001, the Harry Potter saga has experienced countless crucial plot developments, more and more introductions of new characters and actors, several new directors and frequent changes of tone, all to give an astounding and vastly rewarding end result. As a stand-alone film, this largely action heavy film would most likely be dismissed as merely glitzy uninspired bore, but our familiarity and previously established emotional connection with these characters and their stories means that we are holding our breath during every dangerous moment instead sitting back indifferently and indulging in ego- boosting cynicism. Today's moviegoers will not just simply throw away their sympathy and compassion at any tortured, miserable face a director puts on the screen, unless the film in question is a serious depiction of a real-life tragedy. However, when it comes to the Harry Potter characters, there is a remarkable type of long-term relationship that has been built over our long period of acquaintanceship with them, transcending the usual barriers that are placed in front of fictional characters and ultimately making this an impossibly lovable and endlessly enthralling movie.Part 2 of the final chapter initially continues in the vein of its taut yet gloomy predecessor, showing our three effortlessly likable main heroes on their believably difficult quest to locate and destroy Lord Voldemort's horcruxes. Whilst searching, they must constantly be on the lookout for any of the dark lord's ever more numerous agents who are trying furiously to hunt them down. In addition to the vicious death eaters, many other wizard folk who were formerly opposing him have now begun to join his side of the battle out of a deep-seated fear. Others have simply found it easier and simpler to continue drifting along living sheltered lives and being, for the moment, cocooned from the horrors taking place outside. After the comically inept Ministry of Magic was swiftly overthrown, most of its employees have been compliantly carrying on with their everyday work, even though they know what they are contributing to. The same applies to the sedentary yet sinister Gringotts goblins, as we see when the trio makes a clumsy infiltration of the almost impenetrable wizard bank in order to find the next horcrux in a frivolously entertaining early action sequence that, like the opening sequences of the similarly paced Indiana Jones series, is a wonderful appetiser.However, nostalgically like the first six Potter installments, the bulk of this film takes place at the historic Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, placing the search for the remaining horcruxes in a profoundly different environment and atmosphere. Instead of feeling alone and helpless surrounded by nonchalant and corrupt citizens, they are amongst the most loyal and supportive friends anyone could wish for. The infallible trust and beautiful hope we see in their eyes as they see that Harry has arrived to rally them all into finally facing off the forces of evil that are oppressing them is astonishingly touching.However, this is all sadly a double-edged sword, with terrible consequences being presented as well as good points. Voldemort predicted that Harry would return to Hogwarts at some point to seek the aid of his old allies and is ready for him when he arrives. When he makes a full-scale siege on the castle in order to extract Harry, the hundreds of teachers and older students as well as the surviving members of the Order put up a fiercely brave struggle against a colossal dark army of snatchers, giants and death eaters. With the ongoing fatalities and mortal injuries, Harry's conscious is pricked by the thought that he is letting them down as 'the Chosen One' by not being able to defend them. Our empathy is certainly with Harry as the guilt and the doubts overwhelm him, but it is clear that his friends would much rather die in this horrific battle then join Voldemort and gutlessly scavenge an undeserved existence. They stare in the face of terrible danger and somehow know that this can be overcome in the end.This rebellious spirit is supported Voldemort's visible deterioration. He cares only about avoiding death at any cost, and so he has in fact resorted to scavenging that miserable existence, with horrifying results. As the horcruxes are disappearing, he is experiencing a gradual destruction of the soul that is far worse than death. His final demise is far from sudden: the direction from David Yates drops small hints and artistic allusions that show the formerly great and powerful figure slowly being reduced to nothing. That this has all been depicted so effectively is largely attributed to the masterful acting from Ralph Feinnes, who has managed brilliantly to create a very fascinating character. It is often mentioned that the cast is filled with an abundance of accomplished British actors that help significantly to lift the status of the films. While there are countless acting veterans listed in the credits, apart from Feinnes, it is really only Rickman, Gambon, Maggie Smith and Helena Bonham Carter that are given a decent amount to flourish with. Matthew Lewis is another standout, giving a terrific performance incredibly noble, righteous and heroic Neville Longbottom.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a film undoubtedly about loyalty, and both its characters and its fans are in the end rewarded by it. For that, and all of the other reasons, I look forward to seeing this gem soar up the top 250 as far as it can possibly go, and I hope it really pushes the buttons of the arrogant anti-Potter cynics when it land near the top.",10,9,12,24 July 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Plays more to the emotions than to the mind, but what it does, it does well
","Suzanne Collins' novel The Hunger Games was both a thrilling and moving survival story and, more importantly, a profound and deeply disturbing comment on the pervasive nature of political corruption and tyranny and the tragic futility of overzealous public revolution. The point of the both the novel and Gary Ross' impressive film adaptation was that mass uprisings achieve very little, but small, subtle, individual pieces of defiance can achieve a great deal. The political explorations were neatly contained within a depiction of the 74th Hunger Games of the film's title, and the open-ended conclusion was pleasingly thought provoking and self-sufficient.By extending the story into a series of novels, the other two of which I had no desire to read, Collins allowed the astute observations of the first instalment to be overtaken by a radical, impassioned, crowd- pleasing thrust into sudden revolutionary fervour. This is all very rousing and genuinely involving in Francis Lawrence's film adaptation of the sequel Catching Fire, and, from what I hear, the novel successfully taps into the same rebellious zeal, but passively participating in a war between demonic bureaucrats and spunky, underdog insurgents from the lower classes is much less sophisticated and distinctive entertainment than watching a young victim of a dystopian regime balance prudent obedience and caution with stealthy personal defiance. Still, the merciless despotism of the Capitol and the opposing bravery of the insurgents are very convincingly portrayed. Watching this familiar story play out, we fully believe that no one is safe from being beaten, tortured or killed by the oppressive government, with the exception of Katniss, who is the obligatory 'chosen one' in this particular tale of good versus evil. As in the first film, the dangers inside the Hunger Games arena, which here include monstrous, carnivorous monkeys and a terrifying poisonous fog, are palpably menacing. The stakes are convincingly high and the violence of this film is much less sanitised than most Hollywood blockbusters.Also, despite the radicalised political agenda, the story thankfully retains its focus on fully-fledged individual characters, rather than restricting the characters to a narrative toolbox of simplistic archetypes. Peeta, the sweet, selfless gentle giant, is as endearingly heroic and his portrayal by Josh Hutcherson as poignant as in the first film. Jennifer Lawrence also continues doing what she does best, and what won her an Oscar lost year: exuding engagingly vulnerable angst and cynicism as a calloused victim of circumstance who plays hard to get with the audience's sympathy. Her new struggles as a simple archer, big sister, surrogate mother and small-time rebel who has come to be seen as the figurehead and leader of a revolution are indeed very compelling. I certainly found myself sharing her every thought and feeling in her every scene, which is exactly what you want in a protagonist. Liam Hemsworth is once again effortlessly charming as Gale, who, on the other hand, hankers to be at the forefront of the imminent rebellion. The larger and much more active role that Gale is now starting to play gives us the chance to see a little more than mere charisma from Hemsworth as an actor. We also see much more of the coolly despicable and alarmingly observant President Snow as he begins to step out of the bureaucratic shadows and confront Katniss, and the political threat she poses, more openly and mercilessly and we get to see more of 78-year-old Donald Sutherland's effortlessly evil characterisation. It is also very satisfying to see that Effie Trinket, the aristocratic caricature that actor Elizabeth Banks and costume designer Judianna Makovsky entertainingly overplayed and overdressed in the first film, is given quite a few well-handled serious emotional moments this time around, and that Primrose (fine young actress Willow Shield) is showing signs of inheriting her sister's backbone and stealth.This multitude of individual characters and interwoven subplots has now became the greatest asset and primary way of distinguishing between other epic tales of good and evil that ultimately converge at the same narrative and thematic point. When the destination is a given from the moment we have our sneering, sly old villain – Snow – and our feisty young chosen one – although Katniss is at least more interesting than an everywoman – the route taken to that irresistible beacon and the detours along the way is what sets these stories apart from one another and what gives us a reason to travel to the same place so many times. The visual execution of this familiar story is also very commendable and entertaining. Once again, the flamboyant, loud colours and shapes with which the centre of the Capitol is painted brilliantly convey the suffocatingly immense wealth and power of our villains and streets and inhabitants of the impoverished District 12 appear convincingly grim and grisly, but not to the point where our heroes are no longer photogenic. The action scenes inside the arena are very well executed, being very impressively staged, designed and shot this time with omniscient clarity rather than in the chaotic, subjective style of the first film. However, from a narrative point of view, Catching Fire is far more subjective than its predecessor was. We are no longer invited to step back and holistically examine our own society and its history through objective futuristic allegory, but instead we are pulled in intimately close to these particular personal and political conflicts at a level of proximity that snuffs out objectivity as it preys on our emotional impulsivity. Collins and Lawrence certainly succeed in making us emotionally invested and closely involved in the story, quickly and easily getting us to cheer and feel deeply for our heroes and to fear and despise the totalitarian antagonists. This kind of engagement with an audience might not be nearly as intellectual as the devices used earlier in the series, but the emotional subjectivity that has now taken over the series is undeniably just as entertaining and valid in its own way.",8,2,17,11 December 2013
The Social Network," Love the enigmatic disjointed time sequence format by the way
","The advertising of David Fincher's latest film misleadingly introduces a nagging expository sermon on the interlinking worlds of business and cyberspace; however, the film itself heartily agrees with the audience that the aforementioned notions have been tiresomely overdone and instead leads gives them a rousing good time venturing into the thrillingly vibrant lives of several colourful characters. It satisfyingly turns down the obvious option of trying to be deeply moving and meaningful – a hapless endeavour that would inevitably produce another unbearable saccharine bore – in favour of using the opportunity to let us relish the scandalous immorality behind Facebook's creation while it remains safely on the other side of the screen.Computer enthusiast Mark Zuckerberg (brilliantly portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg) is the clever audacious youth miles ahead of the rest who coolly weaves a hazardous tangled web of crafty manipulative feats throughout the film. With a razor-sharp tongue and an unwavering confidence that some may find overbearing, although others may think it justified given his intellectual superiority, he casually and entertainingly parades about the world wielding his remarkable capabilities in a very Holmes-like fashion.Along the way, Mark has a brush with a pair of brawny hot-tempered male twins (both played by Armie Hammer) who at least provided the inspiration for creating the internet giant, and end up suing him for what they belief was the theft of their intellectual property. He also makes ill-fated dealings with fellow networking entrepreneur Sean Parker, (a surprisingly well-cast Justin Timberlake) who effortlessly influences Mark and the audience with his rebellious charm and exciting ideas to secure a share of the company. Sean too carries a sense of fun and upbeat charisma as a movie character harmless in our world of reality.Superbly written by Aaron Sorkin, to whom we have a great many pricelessly witty dialogue pieces to thank for, The Social Network is mostly a slick, stylish, glamorous and highly entertaining medley of ambitious backstabbing teenagers who are also understandably human, but the incorporation of their emotions is kept to a very sensible minimum. The more depressing scenes towards the end and the characters of Mark's loyal friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), gentle ex-girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) and kindly lawyer Marilyn Delpy (Rashida Jones) manage to provide all of the sentimentality that is needed or wanted here.",8,1,2,31 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," Not as good as we'd hoped, but not as bad as we thought
","Everyone acquainted with great, classic American literature knows that F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is an artfully subtle, quietly philosophical character-driven piece that charms readers mostly with its elegance and with its air of mystery and tragedy. Everyone acquainted with popular Australian cinema knows that Baz Lhurmann's films entertain mostly with their novel excesses and their frenetic alternations between comedy and tragedy. However, the results of Lhurmann setting out to adapt this treasured novel along with co- screenwriter Craig Pearce, who penned each film of the Red Curtain trilogy, are surprisingly more successful than one might expect.On several points, the director's showmanship actually seems very appropriate, mostly as he depicts the colourful, decadent, indulgent world of the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby (played very sensitively by Leonardo DiCaprio) whose penchant for the extravagant is as great as Lhurmann's. The scenes inside his colossal, noisy, lavishly decorated mansion bursting with uninvited partygoers from all walks of life give Lhurmann a plausible excuse to use his characteristic frenetic editing, dress hundreds of extras in bright, sparkly costumes, blast out techno- beat dance music and bedazzle us with explosions of loud colours. In its way, these scenes are equally if not more effective at pulling us into the outrageously vibrant world of the excited, optimistic, childlike title character when compared with the original novel. The anachronistic music might be jarring, but I doubt that a party scene using vintage 1920s jazz certainly would have made me feel as wild and electric and as though I were a part of the late night celebrations myself.The soundtrack works even better in the first scene of drunken indulgence, where we see Gatsby's normally well-behaved next-door neighbour Nick Carroway (Tobey Maguire) being literally dragged into a smaller-scale but still riotous celebration by his brutish acquaintance Tom Buchanan (a strikingly conceited Joel Edgerton). A very psychedelic shot of Nick, our narrator and technically our protagonist, observing his own ridiculous behaviour high up in an apartment building from the street below is a rare moment where Lhurmann's stylised visuals manage to communicate some of the complexities of Fitzgerald's celebrated prose. When they're not clearly satirising modern society, they might be adding to key narrative points melodrama that is either engaging or sickeningly alienating, or the camera-work might just be taking us on a bit of a roller-coaster. I did get a little tired of the camera's hyperactivity after a while, but fortunately the cinematographic sugar high is done with after half an hour.The melodrama that comes through afterwards mostly works because the story is, at least on some level, about extremes. If Gatsby and Tom's sweet mistress, Myrtle Wilson (a surprisingly good Isla Fisher) are the lovable fools with an absurd amount of faith in their far-fetched plans – Myrtle desperately hopes that she will be whisked away from her dim, primitive husband (a very poignant Jason Clarke) by a richer dim, primitive husband, Tom –then most of the other characters are either shallow fools or shallow villains. There is no question that the beefy, cocky, controlling, white supremacist Tom is our villain, who in the end becomes truly diabolical. Elizabeth Debicki exudes confident stealth and superficiality as Jordan Baker, seemingly the most streetwise female character but who is ultimately as much of a blunderer as the two hapless romantics, Myrtle and Gatsby. Curiously, though as the beautiful but shallow damsel Daisy Buchanan, the plot-driving object of desire, Lhurmann has cast the captivating Carey Mulligan, who of course endows Daisy with the remarkable emotional depth that she does so well. This fooled me into thinking that Daisy was actually a person of substance, despite her actions, or lack thereof.The character of Nick Carroway is equally thin. In the novel, he is the everyman who, with the exception of the poignant ending in which he becomes an active presence, only exists to witness or catch wind of all the exciting events and give us a cohesive story, In translating Nick to the medium of film, Pearce and Lhurmann add very little, if any, depth of character to him. Lhurmann's direction to Maguire seems to have been little more than to act like a wide-eyed grinning puppy dog cheerily excited by all the serious emotional conflicts around him. At this, Maguire does excel, but if they also wanted him to be an engaging narrator, they should have hired someone with a bit more of a range. The film relies heavily on a voice-over from a weary, crazed Nick who recounts the story in flashback, sitting at his typewriter in the office of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, our little link is not lovable enough to enliven one of the most overused of all cinematic storytelling methods. His deadpan voice-over sucks the life out of Fitzgerald's beautiful prose.Fortunately, though, the butchered narration is occasionally improved with the very striking visual motif of displaying wispy clumps of ashes that shape the words that Maguire is sleepily reciting. Another of the many visual treats is the design of the dismal coal district which is directly in front of the glitzy, colourful wealthy district that is sustained by the hard, manual labour of the lowlier urban dwellers. A large optometrist's billboard containing a giant eye is situated right in the centre of this district, and is frequently cut to as a symbol of the sense of truth and morality that the largely immoral characters turn to at their convenience.The 1974 Gatsby film adaptation is widely considered to be a very accurate, but ultimately soulless cinematic retelling of what is superficially a very dull story, so I suppose that going spectacularly against the tone of the novel was a more likely way to get to its heart. I'm not quite sure that all of the experimental theatrics really give us a new appreciation of the original work, but they are certainly offset by the many solid performances from the key players.",7,0,2,11 July 2013
The Simpsons Movie," A sheer joy, series essence is perfectly captured.
","After twenty years awaiting its arrival 'The Simpsons Movie' is finally here! It is one of the few cartoon movies made nowadays since computer animation came in. A very entertaining feature length adventure that while Homer, Bart, Lisa Maggie and Marge are seen as the central characters every single Simpsons character there is makes an appearance. We also see Colin,  Lisa's Irish boyfriend who shares her desire to stop pollution  the persistent head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Tom Hanks. Staying true to the ridicule of the television series it explores more emotional and serious issues. Such as Springfield being cut off from the rest of the world and Mr. and Mrs. Simpsons' marriage ending, both because of Homer. We also find a close father-son relationship between Ned Flanders and Bart. Stay for the whole of the credits because the entertainment doesn't stop there.",7,1,1,15 March 2009
