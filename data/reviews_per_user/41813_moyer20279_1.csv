Come and See," not impressed
","I watched this thinking it would be a great depiction of the eastern front. By the end I was taking it for what it was; the Russian film interpretation of the eastern front. Don't take this film for truth. Read the book 'Ordinary Men' or something along those lines and get an accurate look at the horrors of the east.I found the Russian view of the Nazis very amusing. They were shown as pirates or even characters from mad max or the smokers from water world.At the end I also found it hard to believe that a small Russian partisan group was able to defeat a regular infantry unit in open combat. Possible, but unlikely.The Kids facial expression is the movie. There are some good scenes, but the whole movie could be edited to 1/2 its length.",Null,1,9,25 August 2011
