The King's Speech," Thank God for Lionel Logue
","The 'Kings Speech' is, as its numerous awards suggest, a magnificent film. I somehow doubt that any actor other than Colin Firth could have portrayed King George VI with such emphatic character empathy. At times you could see the inner agony of the King-in-waiting etched into the facial contortions of this fine, yet somewhat understated, actor. The outbursts of anger and frustration were perfectly timed and added to one's sense of the man as an island, tortured by long-standing self-doubt – and the conviction that greatness was not his destiny.Geoffrey Rush, as always, was powerful as speech therapist Lionel Logue - counsellor, confidante and friend - supporting the second son of King George V as he journeyed along the road to the throne. Always there for the soon-to-be-King's big moments, and always knowing what to say or do, even though, as we discovered when the bonds of friendship had already grown too strong, he had not one formal qualification to his name. The look on the Archbishop of Canterbury's face, when told that this common antipodean charlatan would be seated with the King's family was an absolute classic.Helena Bonham-Carter deserves a mention too, as the long-suffering wife, beautifully played but always as a support role - Helena almost visibly suppressing her undoubted abilities as one of the finest female actresses of our time. She thus ensured that the limelight was never stolen away from the towering performances of Firth and Rush.The 'King's Speech' is a film that teaches us much about people and families. That it was the younger son, the one all but given up by his father as a hopeless case, who was the natural leader, loyal to the ideals of the royal family and understanding the heavy responsibilities that came with it. Contrast this with the immaturity and irresponsibility of his elder brother, someone who is not yet ready to enter manhood, let alone become the King of England. As his dalliances became more serious, and questions began to be asked about the security of the nation under his wayward rule – and all this before he had even celebrated his first anniversary of being crowned - abdication was the only practical solution for the unreliable King Edward VIII.As for the succession of his younger brother, King George VI, to the throne, there is a wonderful moment in the film, just prior to the radio broadcast that gave the film its title, where Churchill confides in the King that he too once had a speech impediment, and implies that he overcame it by utilising the intonations and verboseness that became his hallmark.It was in that moment that one saw the two great men who led Great Britain into WWII and, thankfully, led it out the other end victorious. One does ponder momentarily over the fate that might have befallen Great Britain and Europe had Edward VII remained King, and Chamberlain PM.And it is that thought which leads one to conclude 'thank God for King George VI and Churchill, and thank God for Lionel Logue.'",8,1,1,2 July 2011
The Hunger Games," Good but not Great
","Like 'The Truman Show' 'The Hunger Games' depicts a world in which real people are plunged into an enormous TV set that replicates specific environments, and then filmed 24/7 with numerous hidden cameras.However, the similarity ends there as this movie is not about a relatively benign show with an unassuming and oblivious star. The 'stars' of this show (the 'Tributes') know all about these terrifying 'games', and their likely fate.The 'set' of 'The Hunger Games' is a far more dangerous environment, where violence and death at the hands of the other 'Tributes', or 'natural causes' (i.e. hazards introduced by the shows' producers), is never far away.In this respect 'The Hunger Games' is more akin to a futuristic 'Gladiator' - a blood-thirsty spectator game where the Christians (or in this case the 'Tributes') are cast to the lions, all in the name of entertainment for the masses.Unfortunately 'The Hunger Games' possesses neither the intrigue, subtle hints and slow revelations of 'The Truman Show', nor the double crossing characters, grandiose battles and epic storyline of 'Gladiator'.For me it is a better than average sci-fi movie that could have delivered much more than it did - I wanted it to be great but the formulaic and predictable ending belied the intensity of some the earlier moments, whether that be the central character, Katniss, rushing forward to volunteer for the games in place of her sister, being hunted down by an alliance of other Tributes, or comforting the sweet young dying Tribute who befriended her.As this is the first in a sequel of films it may well be that as the overall plot unfolds this proves to be a more worthy film as the first in the series, rather than a stand-alone movie.Taken as a stand-alone it introduces us to a compelling and chilling idea that gives us a good story line, some well executed scenes and a few memorable characters, which, for me, just scrapes it into the 7/10 league.",7,1,4,26 August 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," How to fail spectacularly even when you're Jerry Bruckheimer
","So what makes this movie such a failure? WellFirstly there's the plot which is actually quite plausible (for a Persian fantasy flick) and could have resulted in a sort of Matrix meets Ali Baba meets Inception type of movie. Instead it just fumbles along from scene to scene, with little smooth interconnection, and a villain in the camp telegraphed so early in the movie you're left screaming 'IT'S HIM' at the screen well before the supposedly wise ruling 'brothers' figure it all out. Secondly there's the casting. Now Jake Gylenhall is one my all time fave actors. He is fantastic at playing ordinary people, usually underplaying by accentuating their flaws. A doleful look here, a wistful smile there and he's nailed it. Fantastic in Brothers, Jarhead etc. etc. But a Persian Prince? A flamboyant saviour of the human race? A kind of super hero? No way. It just doesn't work, it ain't Jake. Even looking at the promo pics he just doesn't look comfortable.And then there is Gemma Arterton (who? I hear you say). Never heard of her before either , won't worry too much if I never hear of her again. Solid wood. No expression, no empathy, nothing. A mysterious queenly temptress? You're 'aving a laugh gov. There was absolutely no chemistry between Jake and Gemma – nothing, zero, zilch.Even that great veteran of character acting, Ben Kingsley, struggled to salvage the plot and script though he was, in my view, by far and away the best thing about it.So we have massive conquering armies sweeping across swirling sand deserts , a usurped and seemingly bitter queen, and the boy who was once the apple of his (adopted) father's eye becoming an outcast as he is accused of his murder. The journey that these two (Jake and Gemma) embark on to seek justice could have been the highlight of the movie, but it is just awkward, almost embarrassing to see them spar and dump, reunite and spar, etc. etc. Yawn. Possibly the best action scene in the movie (and no doubt the ride we'll see soon at Disneyland) is Jake jumping off a high rock with two crossed swords on his backpack, looking for all the world like a male Lara Croft. It is almost as if the rest of the movie is simply in-fill to this climactic scene.So many reasons why this movie doesn't cut it, yet the sequel is already in production.Ah well WTFDIK.",1,30,65,30 October 2010
The Irishman," Making House Painting Interesting
","The Irishman is much, much more than a 'mafia movie'. It is a lens into the US culture in the second half of the twentieth century and, probably, one of the most definitive lenses.Reuniting De Niro, Pacino and Pesci was certainly an amazing feat but if you're expecting another Godfather or Goodfellas, forget it. This movie is not an insight into the mafia and its various manifestations but juxtaposes three different elements, each of which in its own right could easily justify (and in some cases has) a one or two part series.Scorsese and his team very effectively intertwine the mafia, the Teamsters and the Kennedy clan into a bubbling cauldron that spits out some interesting overspill, such as the line 'if they can do that to Kennedy, then.......'.At 3.5 hours long you might think this is a long movie but it really does not feel like that, it is so well made. Granted some of the earlier scenes can get a little confusing as we move from very old Frank, to old (middle-aged?) Frank to 'young' Frank (still old De Niro) but get that past that and you have a fascinating movie that steers you towards answers to some of the fascinating mysteries that define the Kennedy/Nixon era.",8,2,2,18 April 2020
Django Unchained," Pure Escapism
","Like most of Quentin Tarantino's work 'Django Unchained' will defy the efforts of those who seek to categorise movies into neat genres. The best way to describe it is 'Sergio Leone meets Quentin Tarantino meets 50 cents', though the spaghetti comes with a liberal spattering of red sauce, the western is served with a heavy dose of southern bigotry, and hey – why not throw in a little bit of rapping??!.This is a story of love, slavery and bounty hunters in the wild west - interrupted only by a 'Blazing Saddles' type skit which nails the vacuous and ridiculous Ku Klux Klan to their own burning cross in hilarious fashion.For all their immense acting talents Leonardi DeCaprio (Calvin Candie, an egocentric and opportunistic cotton plantation owner) and Samuel L Johnson (the obsequious servant Stephen) are reduced to mere bit players as first Christopher Waltz (bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz) and then Jamie Foxx (main character Django) hold centre stage with their single minded pursuit of their goals.There are some unique and memorable moments in 'Django Unchained', much to take in as your senses are assaulted by gun-slinging slave traders and their complicit 'aristocratic' buyers, the plight of the unfortunate slaves themselves, and the twists and turns that befall our bounty hunter, and his self-proclaimed (albeit oxymoronic) 'free slave'.I loved this film as a form of escapism, and I'm not sure there is a better way to enjoy Tarantino's unique and formidable talents.",7,0,2,5 May 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," They can never take your Freedom!
","The 'Adjustment Bureau' is an abstract movie. In the same way that an abstract painting leaves the viewer to ponder its meaning, so too must the viewer conclude what this movie is really all about. To some it will be a modern love story, to others a fable on the frailty of human nature, and the terrible costs some sections of society, and some might say our planet itself, have had to pay due to the idiosyncrasies and whims of those in positions of power. Others still might relate it to their religion, with the 'Chairman' perhaps being their God, and there are many, many other interpretations too numerous, and unknown, to mention.To me it is a clever and intelligent fantasy sci-fi movie carrying a very uplifting message. I tend to look to the main character of the movie, David Norris (the ubiquitous Matt Damon) as inspiration for my interpretation, as it is basically his tenacity and stubbornness that win the day (and the girl). Emily Blunt is, as always, enchanting as the understated and slightly quirky English dancer, Elise Sellas and it is David's obsession with Elise that drives the movie's plot.Anthony Mackie plays Harry Mitchell, an unlikely Cupid whom ultimately strings David's bow with the desperately needed arrows. And it is really Harry Mitchell's retort towards the end of the movie that resonated with me, and provided the final piece of the jigsaw. He says something akin to 'we wouldn't need to plan for you at all if you could plan things properly yourself'.And therein lies my take-away from this wonderfully enigmatic movie. If you think about it, each and every one of us probably features in the plans of others, whether they be individuals, groups or organisations and whether we know them and their plans or not.This movie tells us that when someone has a plan for us, we don't necessarily have to go along with it, even when it appears to be the mother of all planners - the unseen 'Chairman' – in whose plans we feature. We all have choices and it is David Norris' final choice, to turn the door knob anti-clockwise - which he'd been warned not to - that finally sees the 'Chairman' allowing a replan that has David and Elise together. So if we all want a happy ending we should ditch the plans of others, and make our own choices in life. We should plan our own lives and refuse to become victims of 'higher' plans that others may have us.Don't let the unseen 'Chairman' of the world dictate to you – they can never take your freedom!",Null,0,1,31 July 2011
War Machine," War Truth
","War Machine is amongst that special breed of movies that defy categorisation. At times laugh out loud funny - at others devastatingly, gut-wrenchingly tense and moving. This film takes us on an interesting journey through the mind of a 21st century US General. Maybe he genuinely believes in the hopelessly futile mission he's inherited ('winning the hearts and mind of the people'). Certainly he's portrayed as a man nearing the end of a distinguished career, ever more desperate for that decisive battle that would guarantee his name passing into US military folk-lore alongside the likes of Lee and MacArthur.He appears to be a humanitarian, seeking to minimise civilian casualties, but this could be purely because this is one of the key planks of his driving strategy – counter insurgency. Brilliantly played by Brad Pitt, and ably supported by a motley crew of assorted military aides, the General appears to display more disdain for politicians and his US 'allies' than he does for the 'enemy'. The only reason he appears to be so supportive of the Afghan president, another amusing portrayal by the great Ben Kingsley, is that he is a key ally in the General's counterinsurgency strategy.Yet the General's blinkered, one-track strategy, which only the most loyal of his followers appear to support, is not the most fascinating aspect of this movie. The most incredible thing about this must-watch, ramshackle romp through the General's tenure as the top military man in Afghanistan, is that it is based on true events.",10,7,15,27 May 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," Momentous
","It is inevitable with movies such as 'Zero Dark Thirty' to wonder how accurate the portrayal of historical (albeit recent) events can be. Most of us who lived through those times will be in no doubt that Osama Bin Laden was clearly labelled 'US Public Enemy No. 1'Yet this movie revolves around one woman's determination ('Maya' played by Jessica Chastain) to find this vindictive and reclusive figure-head, often forced to clash with her bosses to get her own way, as she closes in on her target.Whether or not the portrayal is accurate it is clear that a lot of hard graft, and determined (if somewhat questionable) interrogations- plus one vital piece of previously overlooked intelligence – went in to locating the Al Qaeda No.1.And whilst it has to be said that the CIA operatives who died at a supposed meeting with an informant were naïve in the extreme, their deaths in action can be considered no less a sacrifice than all those innocent souls whose lives have been truncated by these dangerous zealots without any real cause.The ambivalent security situation in Pakistan is evident as three terrorists armed with sub-machine guns rake Maya's car (which luckily for her is modified with bullet-proof features) with bullets in broad daylight.The eventual raid on the Bin Laden household is clinical and bloody – with enough intelligence captured that the CIA must still be poring over it even now.This movie captures the powder keg that is Pakistan, the painstaking work that went into locating Bin Laden, the crucial debates in the President's office on percentages of probability that it was Bin Laden's residence (Maya was always 100% convinced), and the professionalism and discipline of the military as they planned and carried out what was, and remains, a daring military raid on foreign soil.It does it though without fanfare or embellishment. It depicts the events but does not seek to influence, and that is what makes this a truly great movie – it is made by those who understand that it depicts one of the most momentous events of the 21st century, an event that exorcised the demons of an entire generation.No further dramatization is required.",9,5,10,16 May 2013
Looper," Looping the Loop
","Think too hard and too long about 'Looper' and your head is likely to explode, either now, in the future, or sometime in the past.It is that kind of movie, a complex web of time shifts which can easily meld in to one and leave you wondering where exactly you are in the time/space continuum, a little like 'Inception'.As long as you are not a total sceptic when it comes to time travel, and can put aside some of the more obvious questions (like how a pin-point accurate time travel system appears to require no more than a ground sheet and four bricks as a receiving station), this a great movie. 'Looper' has a hidden depth that reveals itself as we go, though never slow on action and subtle hints as to what is to come - some of which I'm convinced will take a second viewing to properly hit home. At some point in the movie it dawns on you why even the title of the movie has a deeper significance than being simply the name appropriated by the mob's high-rolling hit-men.For me the revelation came at a point that I was totally drawn in to the film, and emotionally invested in both the moment and the characters.It was one of those stomach-churning moments that turns a good movie great.",8,0,3,1 February 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," A Missed Opportunity
","This is one of those movies that starts so well and promises so much, but ultimately disappoints.It is relatively well made and has an intelligent message but it just stretches believability that little bit too far, before descending into a telescoped and plain wrong ending that just doesn't fit with the dualling pair who have had you vacillating between hatred and sympathy as they reveal their backgrounds and personalities.What a shame such a serious message about the US justice system descends into a simple, moralistic good guy/bad guy farce (and may well, depending on your opinion, choose the wrong 'good guy').Enjoy it for the hokum it is - despair that all involved missed a golden opportunity to make a movie that could have swept the board at the Oscars.",3,1,2,16 August 2010
