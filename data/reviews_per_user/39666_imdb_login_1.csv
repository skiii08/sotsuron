The Ring," Scariest by far
","This is my new all-time-favorite scary movie.  I saw the preview last night and had some pretty cool nightmares afterwards.The visuals were very cool but not over-done.  The plot is terrific and just when you think you understand it all, it all flips around.
The 7 day clock helps the overall suspense.  The story unfolds with perfect balance between giving you enough and yet not enough.  I mean you are on the edge the whole time!This is a MUST SEE.",10,0,0,15 October 2002
