Scarface," I believe this is one of the all time greatest movies of all time. Toney is excellent at changing the game.
","The great film is the remake of the contemporary film with the same name. This movie is about a Cuban refugee that drifts to Miami with the Mariel Boatlift in 1980. The main character is Toney Montana played by Al Pacino, whose plan is take over the drug scene and becomes a drug lord. Along his side is his partner Manny Ribera played by Steven Bauer, who is the only person Toney trust. Once Toney establishes himself at the top of the drug game he steals his love from a fellow dealer, named Elvira Hancock played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Toney gains the power he wants when he joins forces with Alejandro Sosa, who is one of the worlds notorious drug kingpins, played by Paul Shenar. When Fidel Castro opens the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, he sends 125,000 Cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the United States. Among all the refugees, there is one who wants it all, his name is Tony Montana. Tony and his friend Manny arrive in the United States and start in small time jobs. Soon, they are hired by Omar Suarez to pay money to a group of Colombians. When the deal goes wrong, Tony and Manny leave with the money and succeed in their job. Soon Tony meets with drug kingpin Frank Lopez and falls for his boss's girl, Elvira Hancock. Pretty soon Tony will know that those who want it all, do not last forever; that is the price of power. The world will know Montana by one name. In my opinion this is one of the greatest movies of all time. As a gangster film it rates at top of the chart.",Null,0,2,22 September 2013
