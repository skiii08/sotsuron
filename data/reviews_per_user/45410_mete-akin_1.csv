Catch Me If You Can," The most magnificent movie on based true story I've ever been impressed
","First Frank William Abagnale Jr. has a great intelligent. He succeed big thing despite young age I thing F.W.A. Jr. the best impostor in the world . Movie is a fluent,I didn't understand the time passed. Tom Hanks and Leo Dicaprio are fantastic actors no doubt . They admired with acting. In my opinion you must watch the movie. You will regret for you have not watch, and I bet you will say ' I wish I have watched before'.",10,0,1,5 June 2018
