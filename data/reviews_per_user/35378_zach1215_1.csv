Casablanca," It's really not that good
","Why is this movie given such a high rating. Its just not that good of a movie. The acting is mostly poor, and the scripting is repetitive. Some try to argue that Casablanca is a good movie for its time, so it is a classic. But I really can't imagine that people were that stupid back then. Casablanca is really not much better that Gladiator (which was pretty bad).
I wish people would stop believing that old movies are good. It's just something producers do to get you to buy movies. Not that all old movies are bad. On the Waterfront is a really good movie, but Casablanca is just another mediocre Curtz film. So stop pushing it at me.",6,5,15,16 July 2003
