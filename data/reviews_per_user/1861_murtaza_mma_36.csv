Scarface," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Pacino gives a heart-wrenching performance as the modern-day Macbeth
","Brian De Palma's Scarface depicts cinema at its most macabre, and not for a second does Stone's cut-throat screenplay go awry in its unforgiving attempt to limn the naked reality associated with drug mafia and the kingpins who govern it. Brian De Palma's unquenchable thirst to mimic the gore reality on the celluloid didn't go well with the MPAA, which rated even the highly censored third cut of the movie as 'X'. Brian De Palma and the producer Martin Bergman arranged a hearing with the MPAA and roped in a panel of experts including some narcotics officers, who testified the movie's verisimilitude to the conditions prevalent in the drug underworld. Their testimonies greatly convinced the members of the rating board, who eventually condescended to give an 'R' rating to the aforesaid third cut of the movie. Brian De Palma used the pervasive kerfuffle as a subterfuge to release the unedited original version of the movie instead of the curtailed one and kept this fact surreptitious for months until the movie was released on videocassettes. A remake of a 1932 classic of the same name, Scarface portrays the life of a young, tempestuous Cuban émigré named Tony Montana, highlighting his sanguinary journey from being a thug to becoming a kingpin of drug mafia. Montana's story is one of rise and fall, trust and deceit, love and hatred, greed and lust, but most importantly: life and death. He is a hapless victim of the vicissitudes of his time; a product of his tainted conscience and naked ambition. As the modern-day Macbeth, Montana is the quintessential anti-hero of American cinema: he adores his friends and folks, and is unforgiving to his foes. Brian De Palma took yet another calculated risk by choosing Al Pacino, who was then going through a lean patch in his career, to play Montana's part. Pacino took few months off to prepare himself for the role and to perfect his Cuban accent. Chagrin driven, Pacino uses all his talent and guile to give Montana an ineffable charm and an element of frenzy, which not only brings Montana to life, but also makes the portrayal, singularly remarkable. Pacino's breathtaking performance, which is arguably his best, manages to hold the viewer in a transfixion right from the inception to the finale. In fact, it's clear from the very first scene itself (the first scene in which Pacino is interrogated by the police for being a Cuban emigrant) that Pacino is on an inexorable mission to outperform not only his contemporaries, but also himself. He punctiliously takes care of the nuances and the subtleties in mannerisms needed for an exorbitant portrayal such as Montana's. As Tony Montana, Pacino not only substantiates his acting prowess and answers his critics once and for all, but also establishes Montana as a cult figure in American cinema. The entire cast has given a thorough performance with a special mention of Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer. Pfeiffer is absolutely ravishing in her intense portrayal of the quintessential, uber-sexy mobster's moll. The chemistry between Pfeiffer and Pacino is scintillating and at times, awe-inspiring.The movie is a highlight reel of some of the most graphic and grotesque sequences ever caricatured in cinema. The scene in which Tony Montana asseverates his innocence and loyalty to the drug kingpin Frank Lopez elevates cinema to a new zenith, while the Macbeth like climax gives the movie an operatic feel that is seldom associated with cinema.Scarface marked the upsurge of a new force in cinema: the triumvirate of De Palma, Stone and Pacino. Almost three decades have passed since Scarface, but Al Pacino, Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone still enjoy a global iconic status as they continue to enthrall the audiences worldwide with their idiosyncratic cinematic styles.PS. Scarface has become a prototype in modern cinema and is one heck of a cinematic experience, but is not meant for the faint-hearted, or the sycophantic adherents of conservative cinema. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,33,46,6 February 2011
Citizen Kane," Citizen Welles
","Citizen Kane is probably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, nigh perfect from the start till the end. Often competing with The Godfather, to be numero uno, Citizen Kane is in a league of its own and nonpareil on countless number of fronts. The creative innovation and the technical advancements implemented, can be least regarded as incredible and astonishing, for a 1941 movie. The movie pioneered the phenomena of time switching and special effects in the world of cinema.Citizen Kane has stood the test of time for well over six decades, serving as a benchmark and source of inspiration to the film-makers of different era. Citizen Kane is an obituary about a fictitious Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate and a newspaper tycoon. Through this movie, Orson Welles, not only immortalized Charles Foster Kane but also proved his mettle, as a writer, director, actor and most importantly as an auteur. The scenes presented as flashbacks, not only display his versatility as an actor (taking care of the nuances and the subtleties needed to portray the different stages and aspects of Kane's life), but also his story-telling brilliance. Kane's murmuring of the word 'rosebud' at the time of his death and him publicly annihilating his election opponent, Jim Getys, represent the two extremes of human life, the very low and the very high, respectively.The scenes between Welles and Joseph Cotton are an absolute treat to watch, the latter being at his sarcastic best, depicting contrasting emotions of sympathy and disgust towards his childhood friend, owing to the dichotomy that he suffered, simultaneously taking care of his duties as a journalist, and his friendship with Kane. The movie is studded with numerous mesmerizing and unforgettable scenes and moments, which immensely contribute to the apotheosis that it so deservedly enjoys. A true cinematic magnum opus, without an iota of a doubt and a must for every cinema lover.",10,48,73,24 April 2009
Midnight in Paris," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Woody Allen's ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past
","Midnight in Paris is a subtle romantic drama with a comical touch that has a little bit of almost everything: be it magic-realism, romance, phantasm, voyeur, surrealism or even noir. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to proclaim that everything that Woody Allen learned and gained during his long stint in cinema culminated in form of Midnight in Paris – An ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past. Driven by the very impetus that gives cinema its resonant charm, Woody Allen the auteur has seen his art go from strength to strength, taking new shapes and forms, being completely oblivious of the existence of his larger than life alter ego, Woody Allen the showman, whose stimulating works have been a treat for us all for last so many decades, and who himself has been a force to reckon with, right throughout his long and illustrious career that still seems to be in its prime.I have grown up watching works of legendary Dev Anand, whose iconic movie career spanned well over six decades. Being an Indian, I guess it comes naturally to one! The first that I heard of Woody Allen was when someone eloquently referred to Dev Sahab as the Indian Woody Allen. It indeed seemed revolting! A showman, whom not only you but also your grandparents have grown up watching being compared to some run-of-the- mill movie maker form the Occident. But, it did succeed in getting me hooked. Today, I find the comparison to be much more apt. Dev Sahab was oblivious to the changing trends in the India Cinema, and remained royal to his idiosyncratic style. The same can be said about Mr. Allen, who became the champion of a resurgent parallel stream in American Cinema— inspired by the avant garde works of European auteurs like Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman—while others kept busy figuring out their new roles in rapidly changing American movie circles. Marion Cotillard and Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris Vintage Woody Allen, watching Midnight in Paris is like savoring the great city of Paris from the eyes of Mr. Allen himself. Midnight in Paris made an emphatic debut at the 2011 Cannes Festival, and succeeded in leaving a lasting impact on most of those present at the screening. During a press conference at Cannes, Woody Allen had said that he wanted to show the city of Paris emotionally, and wanted it to be the way he himself sees it, and he indeed succeeds in fulfilling his dream by bringing the city to life, thanks to his perspicacious eye.Midnight in Paris presents a chapter in the life of a successful but disillusioned Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), who yearns to break the shackles of monotony by writing a fiction novel, but is perplexed by his slender prospects as a writer beyond the glamour and razzmatazz of the sequestered world of Hollywood, while he is out on a vacation to the breeding ground of creativity and talent, Paris, and accompanying him are his ravishing fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), and his affluent future in-laws. The perfunctory relationship that Gil shares with his fiancée seems to be a result of Inez' perpetually disinterested outlook towards Gil's ambition of graduating into a full- fledged writer by making a foray into fiction writing. The beauty of Midnight in Paris is that it poses several questions, and while many of them may be answered in the due course of the movie, the true onus truly lies with the viewer to fathom the reality based on his own understanding. One major question that would continuously perplex the viewer is whether it is the yearning for creativity or the want for true love or the search for something even more profound that's haunting Gil? Midnight in Paris has loads to offer even to the average viewer, especially to ones who are willing to delve deep into realm of the unknown to savor the real delight that awaits them. The dreamlike sequences that depict Gil interacting with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and Pablo Picasso are an absolute treat to watch. While I greatly admire Hemingway and Fitzgerald for their indelible contribution to English Literature, I just absolutely idolize Luis Bunuel not only as a Surrealist, but also as a movie maker par excellence. Who can dare to overlook Bunuel's decorated oeuvre right from his maiden venture, An Andalusian Dog (1929), which he collaborated with another pioneer Surrealist, Salvador Dali to his surrealistic magnum opuses, The Exterminating Angel (1962), to which Mr. Allen pays a tribute in the movie, and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), which won the Best Foreign Picture Oscar for the year?Woody Allen's inspired direction and inciteful screenplay are well complemented by a very fine ensemble of support cast that includes the likes of Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody. The music and cinematography are awe-inspiring to say the least. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams perfectly fit in their respective caricatures, and the charming presence of Marion Cotillard adds a whole new spark to the movie. Midnight in Paris has already managed to bag a handful of accolades, and the Oscar nomination is indeed an icing on the cake. Midnight in Paris crosses genres, and presents cinema at its most colorful, while also serving to be a delightful cinematic experience that has something for almost everyone. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,21,28,17 February 2013
Youth," One of the best films of the year
","There is a sense of nostalgia in the films of Paolo Sorrentino. The nostalgia often comes across as a sense of regret for the loss of innocent love experienced by the central characters during their youth. Such a regret can easily fills one's heart with melancholy but Sorrentino seems to have mastered the art of mixing gravity with levity. His films can be both serious and farcical at the same time and that's why they are more complex than what they prima facie appear. Youth‬ is no different.Here is a film about larger-than-life oldies pining for their long past golden years of youth. We have a retired conductor (Michael Caine), a self-indulgent filmmaker well past his prime (Harvey Keitel), an insecure actor (Paul Dano), a mountaineer, a Miss Universe with brains, and an overweight footballer (most probably based on Maradona). There is a lively cameo from Jane Fonda who plays a legendary actress from Hollywood and then there is Rachel Weisz who plays the conductor's daughter.Among other things (which certainly include Sorrentino's brilliant direction), it is the performances of Caine and Keitel that makes it a treat to watch. While Keitel steals every scene that he is a part of, Caine delivers a deeply nuanced performance around which the entire movie revolves. Youth is nowhere near being Sorrentino's best but it is certainly one of the best films of the year.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog 'A Potpourri of Vestiges'.",8,37,56,15 November 2015
The Prestige," Are you watching closely?
","The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet 'The Great Danton' with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name 'The Professor' with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of 'The Transported Man' and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of 'The Transported Man', which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: 'Are you watching closely?' A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10",10,185,214,7 September 2009
Pacific Rim," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi extravaganza
","A futuristic film set in the 2020s, Pacific Rim presents the final chapter in the devastating war between humankind and an alien race of monstrous sea creatures called 'Kaiju' which emerged from deep beneath the Pacific Ocean through a fissure between two tectonic plates, an inter-dimensional portal termed as 'The Breach'. The human race, in a bid to fight these monsters, is forced to create monsters of its own known as 'Jaegers'—gigantic humanoid robots controlled by two human pilots, whose minds are connected by a neural bridge capable of establishing a psychic intimacy through a phenomenon called 'The Drift'.Doesn't the story sound familiar? Well, you bet! Apparently, the plots of almost all modern sci-fi films, especially those spawned by Hollywood, seem to revolve around the very same context. The aliens are on the charge and the bravest amongst our race must rise to the occasion and put their lives on the line in order to save the world from an impending apocalypse. And, invariably, the only aspect that differentiates it from the other films of its kind is its visual appeal. How grand is the use of CGI and VFX is all that matters. For, these films are all style with very little substance. On the face of it, Pacific Rim appears to be no different. In fact, with regards to its visual makeup, Pacific Rim comes across as another perfect summer blockbuster made in the vein of Transformers or Iron Man films. Honestly speaking, after seeing the movie's rushes, I was more or less convinced that Pacific Rim was just another ostentatious, run-of-the-mill Hollywood product in the making.But, Guillermo del Toro never ceases to amaze with his genius! Pacific Rim is not merely a visual spectacle but it's also a film that can be deemed a consummate cinematic product: a great deal of attention is given to character development, the narrative works well on the emotional level, and occasional bursts of humour ensure that the tension gets punctuated every now and then. Pacific Rim reminds me of another very well made sci-fi film that seemed to perfectly blend flamboyance with substance: Neill Blomkamp's brilliant District 9 (2009). But, make no mistake! The content of Pacific Rim is far from being original. In fact, the film seems to borrow a lot from classic sci-fi films. Thus, it wouldn't be wrong to look upon Pacific Rim as del Toro's homage to classic films like Star Wars, Independence Day, Godzilla, Avatar, and Transformers.Overall, Pacific Rim comes across as an extremely well made sci-fi, action-adventure extravaganza. Its breathtaking, sumptuous visual graphics clubbed with a strong emotional quotient make it one of a kind. No one but Guillermo del Toro could have handled a seemingly commonplace plot with such delicacy, ingeniously transforming it into an end product that's not only richer but also smarter than the rest. While the acting is solid all around, the cinematography, editing and music are all, without a shadow of a doubt, topnotch. It's quite shocking that del Toro's film went completely unnoticed at all the major award functions, barring a single BAFTA nomination for Best Special Visual Effects. Pacific Rim offers truckloads of entertainment and keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat, throughout its runtime. It's a heady cocktail of style and substance that packs a powerful punch. 8/10A more in-depth review can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",8,1,3,20 April 2014
The Lost City of Z," Percy Fawcett comes across as a thinking man's Indiana Jones
","It's really heartening to see Hollywood still making such movies... it's heartbreaking to see American audiences snubbing it even as they continue to embrace the dumb superhero films. Had David Lean made Embrace of the Serpent then perhaps it would have looked like The Lost City of Z. Here is a film that reminded me of so many great movies. A discernible viewer would find shades of Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, The New World, The Wages of Fear, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Charlie Hunnam plays an English explorer Percy Fawcett who comes across as a thinking man's Indiana Jones. The movie also features deeply nuanced performances from one of my modern favorites, Robert Pattinson, and the intelligently beautiful Sienna Miller.Kudos to director James Gray for his vision and courage to realize a film like The Lost City of Z. If you love the kind of films that I have talked about in the review then certainly you cannot afford to give this film a miss.For more on world cinema please visit my film site 'A Potpourri of Vestiges'.",8,1,2,30 July 2017
The Godfather: Part II," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Godfather of all sequels
","The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vito's death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando's portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota's poignant score and Gordon Willis' vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10,21,30,17 May 2009
Burn After Reading," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The great espionage parody
","Coen Brothers' Burn After Reading (2008) is a roller coaster of a ride. Even with its bizarre story, hyper-real characters, incongruous setting the movie incredibly manages to keep one engaged from starting to finish. Burn After Reading serves to be a great parody on the espionage films of the bygone era. The seemingly strange casting of Malkovich, Clooney, McDormand, Swinton and Pitt turns out to be the movie's greatest asset: it's their impeccably flawed performances that gives the movie its real impetus. Burn After Reading serves to be a quintessential Coen Brothers film with its subtle, immaculate use of Dark Humor. The movie's strange outlook may make it appear like an exercise in style to those not accustomed to such unconventional style of filmmaking. But the receptive audience is expected to appreciate it more. So, if you are bored by the monotony of life or the mundaneness of cinema and want to try out something new then Burn After Reading is exactly what you are looking for!!!http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,4,6,18 January 2013
Man of Steel," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Zack Snyder's Sci-Fi spectacle with a weak intellectual appeal
","Man of Steel is the first installment in the much-anticipated 'Superman' reboot helmed by American filmmaker Zack Snyder. The movie marks the return of the DC Comics iconic superhero to the celluloid after a seven- year-long hiatus following the abysmal show of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006).Co-written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill in the role of the eponymous superhero—a part that was immortalized by the late Christopher Reeve. The movie's stellar ensemble cast includes the likes of Amy Adams (as Lois Lane), Russell Crowe (as Jor-El), Kevin Costner (as Jonathan Kent), Laurence Fishburne (as Perry White), Diane Lane (as Martha Kent), and Michael Shannon (as General Zod).Man of Steel takes a departure from the trademark style of the 'Superman' films starring Christopher Reeve. Make no mistake! Man of Steel's striking contrast to its predecessors is not merely because of its technical supremacy (3D, Special Effects, etc). Even the makers choose to make a statement by opting for a title that doesn't have the word 'Superman' attached to it (not to mention about Superman's new costume). In fact, it would be safe to look upon this rather drastic transformation as a paradigm shift. Man of Steel serves to be a decent summer flick with truckloads of entertainment value for the casual viewers. But, sadly, for the most part, it remains limited to entertainment. Snyder shows flashes of brilliance but fails to capitalize on those strong moments. Man of Steel offers a lot a promise but falls short of living up to it. At best, it serves to be a run-of-the mill sci-fi adventure that is all style but very little substance. Hopefully, Snyder and team will learn from their mistakes and make a strong comeback with the forthcoming installments. 6.5/10A more detailed review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",7,19,35,27 June 2013
The Revenant," A treatise on man's symbiotic relationship with mother nature
","After watching The Revenant one is bound to impressed by certain aspects of the movie. One, with Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. One just can't help but be in awe of his art. Second, with the acting performances of ‪Leonardo DiCaprio‬ and Tom Hardy and in that order. DiCaprio's Oscar is thoroughly deserved. No argument(s) can justify otherwise, especially in comparison to the competition on offer. Given he gets to speak very little English, the part can qualify as non-English which puts DiCaprio in a very special league of Oscar winners. His performance reminds one of Tom Hank's gruelling portrayal in Cast Away. As for Hardy, he is undoubtedly robbed off an Oscar. It's his portrayal of a mangy mongrel that makes the movie deviously entertaining. Third, of course by Inarritu's cinematic vision. The Revenant may far from being a great film (actually, that's for the time to decide) but it is nothing short of a bold statement which will inspire other leading filmmakers to push their boundaries. The film is more about survival than it's about revenge and that's where most people have got it wrong. Laymen may call it man versus wild but those with keener observation will perceive it as a treatise on man's symbiotic relationship with mother nature. The only way to watch it is on the big screen else you would be doing a great injustice to yourself.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog 'A Potpourri of Vestiges'.",9,0,4,29 February 2016
Hugo," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: American filmmaker Martin Scorsese's tribute to the unsung heroes of cinema.
","Hugo is an Oscar-winning motion picture directed by veteran American auteur, Martin Scorsese. With Hugo, Scorsese adds a whole new dimension to his oeuvre. Hugo takes a paradigm shift from Scorsese's style of movie-making - usually driven by gore, gangsters and grotesquery - that has been his trademark for over four decades. While the violence and crime has made for subtlety and humor, Scorsese still manages to conjure up an aura of enchanting brilliance in Hugo. Like most of Scorsese's works, Hugo is masterfully crafted, both on technical as well as emotional fronts. In other words, Scorsese once again succeeds in putting a soul into the movie by painting the canvas with colors of his vivid imagination. All this enriches Hugo with an aesthetic feel that greatly enhances its beauty.In Hugo, Scorsese presents a tale of an orphan boy, Hugo Cabret, who is provided shelter by his drunkard uncle after the accidental death of his father (Jude Law). Hugo assists his uncle in keeping the clocks at the railway station running. Son of a clockmaker, Hugo is adept at fixing clockworks, and his predilection for pilfering mechanical parts in order to mend an automaton - that Hugo's father was trying to repair before his untimely death - brings him face to face with a ruthless proprietor, Monsieur George (Ben Kingsley), who owns a toy store at the station. Monsieur George catches Hugo while the latter was trying to steal a toy from the former's shop, and confiscates his belongings including a notebook - left by Hugo's father - that seems to contain drawings of some mechanical prototypes. On observing the notebook, Monsieur George grows suspicious of Hugo, and inquires him about its source of origin. When Hugo refuses to oblige, Monsieur George threatens to hand him over to the Station Patrol. Hugo pleads to Monsieur George to return his notebook, but the latter threatens to burn it to ashes. Seeing his efforts go in vain, Hugo follows Monsieur George all the way to the latter's home where he gets acquainted with Monsieur George's amiable goddaughter, Isabelle. What ensues is an adventurous journey, which would help unravel the mysteries associated with Monsieur George's obscure, albeit decorated past, and its connection to Hugo's.Like Woody Allen in Midnight in Paris, Scorsese too chooses the inter-war Paris as the movie's backdrop, but unlike Allen, Scorsese's love for Paris seems rather unbiased, as he chooses to represent the city of love in the microcosm of an ever bustling railway station, occasionally punctuated by quick bursts of joy and sadness. Scorsese uses the movie as a medium to pay tribute to the unsung heroes, the likes of Lumiere Brothers, Georges Melies and numerous other pioneers, who crafted the beautiful world of cinema through their vision, tenacity and hard work. Hugo succeeds in capturing the true beauty and wonder of cinema, as a vicarious medium, which has the power to catapult the viewer into the realm of the unimaginable and the inexpressible. Hugo is a testament to Martin Scorsese's adaptability and versatility as a movie maker, who doesn't leave a single stone unturned in order to conquer the last front: making a foray into a genre that's exactly opposite to his forte. Vintage Scorsese, Hugo simultaneously serves to be an emotional drama as well a visual spectacle.Almost everyone in the cast gives a memorable performance with special mention of Asa Butterfield who is a treat to watch as Hugo Cabret, and Ben Kingsley who uses his thespian experience to emote with remarkable levels of maturity and panache that's seldom demonstrated by contemporary actors. The movie's background score, cinematography, and editing are all top-notch, and brilliantly complement Scorsese's inspired and imaginative direction. Hugo presents movie making at its absolute best, and is a must watch for everyone across all age groups.(This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)",9,0,1,30 May 2015
Duck You Sucker," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Sergio Leone's thought-provoking masterpiece featuring an unforgettable Rod Steiger performance
","Duck, You Sucker (1971) aka A Fistful of Dynamite is an underrated gem that undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone. Anyone who has seen the 'Dollars Trilogy' can easily mistake Leone for a mere showman, but those who have had the privilege of watching his more personal works like Once Upon a Time in America would know better. Leone was indeed a master showman but he knew well how to blend style with substance.In the 'Dollars Trilogy' style clearly is the real driver but deep down there is strong sense of realism that a keen eyed viewer wouldn't find hard to discern. The conspicuous levity only serves the purpose of a translucent film used to hide the naked reality so as to protect an average viewer from getting jumpy at its very sight. In Duck, You Sucker this translucent film only happens to be a fraction more transparent than usual. In other words, Leone chooses to be a bit more direct in his presentation of realism: most evident in the firing squad sequences. Duck, You Sucker thus serves to be a perfect amalgamation of style and substance.In many ways, Duck, You Sucker happens to be Leone's darkest work. And how could it not have been? For the movie revolves around a highly unlikely union of a Mexican bandit and an Irish dynamite expert caught in the turmoil of the Mexican revolution. The only thing that unites these two completely different personalities is the fact that one is called Juan and the other, John. Juan sees this coincidence as a divine signal. That their union is meant to serve a much greater purpose: to rob the great bank of Mesa Verde. The loquacious Juan desperately tries to convince the taciturn John, but the later remains uninterested. Thus ensues a tantalizing game of cat and mouse between Juan and John as the two try their best to outwit each other only to be united by an eternal bond of friendship.There are scenes in Duck, You Sucker that will stay with the viewer for ever. There are dialogues/monologues (spoken as well as unspoken) that will leave a lasting impact on the viewer. Juan's commentary on his own understanding of the word 'revolution' is one. There's is another when a caged bird defecates on Juan's head and the bandit looks up and says: 'For the rich, you sing!' Ennio Morricone's mystical music will continue to haunt the viewer much beyond the length of the movie. The movie's use of non-verbal language is probably as strong as the use of verbal one: best explained by Rod Steiger's expressions of elation, shock, disgust and self-pity. Duck, You Sucker is Sergio Leone's second best work (after Once Upon a Time in America) and features an unforgettable performance from the great Rod Steiger who is well complemented by James Coburn--in arguably his best role ever. Duck, You Sucker will serve as an elixir for any intelligent viewer and offers enough food for thought to keep him occupied until long after the film the over.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10,10,13,2 February 2013
Quantum of Solace," A Potpourri of Vestiges: The Quantum that lacked Solace
","Quantum of Solace or Quantum so less, as some of its critics may call it, definitely lacks certain aspects of a traditional Bond movie. It may be eccentric in the sense that it may not be able to titillate the esoteric Bond fans as it may lack their eclectic style and taste but it definitely succeeds in projecting a new Bond for the contemporary world who may not be a coeval of a superhero, who despite being vulnerable has got the killer instinct in him, which is the very defining characteristic of Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. This Bond goes about his business in a fashion which is far more realistic compared to the Bond of the bygone era with an incredible passion and utmost devotion which is nothing but inexorable. Though Casino Royale was the pioneer of this graduation but its Quantum of Solace that consummates it and gives Fleming's agent a mystique which has always eluded him hitherto, an aura which gives him an opportunity to be mortal and hence a chance to qualify to be called a human.Quantum of Solace is loaded with mind blowing action sequences which makes it a high octane extravaganza. The pace of the movie is such that you hardly get time to breathe freely. The plot though comparatively weaker than its precursor, is still good enough to keep one guessing thereby keeping one at the edge of the seat, all the way through. The only aspect of the movie which should be under the scanner is its editing which is far from just and at times needless and severely annoying. A bit constraint editing under some meticulous vigilance could have done wonders and would have probably helped it, in its quest to be the best Bond movie of all time. All being said and given what we have, the movie fails to disappoint the audience and will surely redefine the very prerequisites of an action movie and will definitely serve as a benchmark for the movies in the years to come.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",7,32,41,8 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema
","Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, 'You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,' also happens to be one of all time favorite. The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10,84,105,8 July 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The swashbuckling first installment in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy—the much awaited prequel series to the ubiquitously acclaimed The Lord of the Rings Trilogy—based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, or There and Back Again. The trilogy's second and the third installments viz. 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' and 'The Hobbit: There and Back Again' are scheduled to release in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey presents the first part of the quest undertaken by an artless hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and a band of vagrant dwarfs to help the latter reclaim their lost kingdom from the clutches of a fiendish dragon named Smaug. During the course of the journey Bilbo and company must always remain wary of the dangers lurking in the shadowy avenues of the Middle-earth. And the sooner they learn to trust each other's instincts the better would be the odds of their survival.In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson once again shows why he is hailed in the film circles as an auteur par excellence. When it comes to the fantasy genre Jackson truly has no equal. An Unexpected Journey serves to be a visual spectacle of a very unique kind, one that appeals both to the soul and the intellect. While one is dazzled by the movie's visual sumptuousness, it's quite difficult to overlook the emotional subtext—most evident in Bilbo's homesickness and the plight of the dwarfs who have been driven out of their rightful dwellings by a ferocious usurper. It's indeed awe-inspiring to see the way Jackson manages to strike the right kind of balance between style and substance.Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an exhilarating cinematic experience for viewers of all ages and groups. Vintage Jackson, the movie serves to be a fine specimen of masterful storytelling. Unlike most modern-day movies of its kind, An Unexpected Journey never lets story take the backseat and while technology plays a pivotal part the real emphasis is always on the movie's plot. Most of the sequences in the movie are beautifully crafted. The one in which Bilbo encounters the ever so spiteful Gollum remains my absolute favorite. While the movie's use of CGI and VFX is quite exemplary in itself the 3D and HFR effects serve to be a real icing on the cake that makes the movie quite unique even in comparison to its predecessors. Jackson manages to elicit worthy performances from his entire cast of actors. An Unexpected Journey has set the ball rolling for the final two installments of the trilogy, but what still remains to be seen is whether it would be possible for Jackson and team to match the success of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, both from the financial as well as critical point of view?A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,4,6,20 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Action flick of the year, should you choose to watch it!
","The long wait is finally over as Tom Cruise finally returns to the celluloid to reprise his epic role of the enigmatic IMF agent Ethan Hunt. The brilliance of Mission: Impossible III was marred by the infamous sacking of Tom Cruise by Paramount's owner and movie mogul Sumner Redstone, who blamed Cruise's bizarre sofa-hopping TV antics, and intransigent support of Scientology for movie's relatively poor show at the box office that resulted in losses of up to £75million in revenue. The sordid incident ensured that the wait for the next installment of the franchise had to be a long one. The half a decade lull that ensued saw Cruise's career sunk to a new nadir with movies like Lions for Lambs (2007), Valkyrie (2008), and Knight and Day (2010) failing to impress at the box office, while his contemporaries and coevals continued to tumble records at the box office, attaining new heights of fame and stardom. It is indeed ironic that Cruise's most impressive show in this interim has been his well-disguised cameo in Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder (2008) in which he plays a the foul-mouthed, hot-headed, half-bald studio executive. But, every coin has the other part that completes the picture. While the things have been going a bit rough on the professional front, Cruise's personal life has finally been witnessing a much needed sense of calmness and stability. Such stability on the personal front can often lift a person's morale providing him with a sense of rejuvenation that can help him fare well in all the facets of life. Tom Cruise's rejuvenated self is pretty much apparent in the latest installment of the MI franchise, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.Ghost Protocol takes the viewer on a roller coaster of a ride from Moscow to Dubai, all the way to Mumbai, never allowing a breathing space, keeping him on the edge of the seat throughout. MI – GP is indeed the quintessential action extravaganza that the ardent lovers of the genre perpetually anticipate to devour upon in order to satiate their ever growing hunger for unremitting action and adventure. Ethan Hunt is back in all his glory with some newly added dimensions to his old daredevilry that had established him as the greatest contemporary to Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. As seen with Bond in Casino Royale, the key men behind the MI franchise have made conscious efforts to make the caricature of Hunt more vulnerable to danger and crises, and hence more human. MI – GP delivers everything that an action-movie lover craves for: suspense, intrigue, passion, daredevilry, razzmatazz, and much more. The adrenaline filled action is well complemented by the dazzle of the geeky gadgets on display and it is this synergy that makes MI – GP an incredibly sublime experience. The tremendous reputation that the high octane franchise carries meant the newly appointed director Brad Bird—mostly renowned for his animation flicks The Incredibles and Ratatouille—had his work cut out for him. Brad Bird has indeed been up to the task and has lived well to the expectations of Cruise and the entire production team led by J.J. Adams, who directed the third movie of the series back in 2006. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is packed with a plethora of action sequences that includes a shootout in Budapest, an escape sequence from a Moscow Jail, a sandstorm chase in Dubai, and a classic brawl in an automated parking garage in Mumbai. However, the sequence that stands out is the one in which Tom Cruise climbs the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa by clinging to it from the outside using suction gloves, giving the Spiderman a run for his money. After the splendidly executed siege of the Vatican in the third installment, Ethan and his IMF team are on the lookout for some classified information pertaining to a Russian extremist Kurt Hendricks, which takes their quest to Kremlin. The covert mission goes awry as their plan is sabotaged by the personal intervention of Hendricks, which turns the tables on Cruise and his team rendering them sequestered and helpless. The questionable events that unfold at Kremlin, forces the US President to invoke the Ghost Protocol leading to the disavowal of IMF. Ethan and his team, which includes the computer geek Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), despite their severe handicap are the only hope left at preventing the diabolical duo of Hendricks and his stalwart Wistrom from fulfilling their demonic mission of global destruction through a nuclear war. Simon Pegg as Benji is spot on with his persiflage, and his nonchalance adds a much needed levity to the otherwise tense plot. Paula Patton as Jane Carter is a treat to the sore eyes: her imperial gait, upright posture, predatory agility, dusky complexion, steamy mystique, athletic built, curvaceous figure, and apparent haughtiness make her an object of envy for males and females alike. Her ethereal presence undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. The introduction of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt adds another layer of intrigue to the plot of MI – GP. Brandt's enigmatic part allows Renner to depict a wide array of emotions that his previous roles couldn't offer. The over-hyped inclusion of veteran Indian actor Anil Kapoor in the MI – GP cast is undoubtedly movie's greatest disappointment, especially from the perspective of Indian cineastes, as the actor fails to make an impression during his ephemeral performance.Overall, MI – GP has managed to raise the bar for the Action genre. Indian movie-makers, who have recently started to delve into the genre, can look to take a note or two out of MI – GP in order to iron out the usual glitches. Despite the occasional lack of coherence in the plot, MI – GP works quite well at almost all the levels and promises to be a great entertainment. 8/10www.apotpourriofvestiges.com",8,179,271,16 December 2011
Django Unchained," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's scurrilous lampoon on human trafficking
","Django Unchained presents the larger-than-life tale of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who collaborates with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz)—a German dentist-turn-bounty hunter—in order to rescue his wife from the servitude of a ruthless Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The story begins in the US state of Texas in the year 1858—two years prior to the start of the American Civil War. The tone of the movie is set by Luis Enriquez Bacalov's original 'Django Theme Song' sung by Rocky Roberts—taken as it is from Sergio Cobucci's Django (1966)—which plays with the opening credits. Django Unchained is Tarantino's tribute to the visionaries of Western filmmaking—those who conceptualized the decorated genre and more so those who prevented it from dying by reinventing it. The Western genre has always fascinated Tarantino. Right from the beginning of his career it has been his dream to make a Western of his own. Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci are the two filmmakers who seem to have inspired him the most. With Django Unchained, Tarantino finally seems to be living his lifelong dream of emulating his childhood idol. And what makes Django Unchained even more special is the fact that it comes at a time when the Western genre once again finds itself on the brink of obsolescence.While the classic works of John Ford and Howard Hawkes epitomize the golden age of Western filmmaking, the grotesque, tongue-in-cheeky works of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci—often referred to as Italo-Western or more prominently as Spaghetti Western—clearly represent its new age. At a time when Western genre was looked upon by most filmmakers as dead and buried, Leone and Corbucci not only rejuvenated it but also changed its very face for the better. The Old West which was once governed by the tenets of pride, honor, chivalry, machismo and idealism got metamorphosed into a brutal realm inhabited by realistic, grey-shaded characters that despite their endless flaws couldn't be deemed completely devoid of human virtues. While Leone is often regarded as the master creator of Spaghetti Western cinema, people often overlook the indelible contribution made by Corbucci. With movies like Django (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), Corbucci succeeded in adding a whole new dimension to the Spaghetti Western canvas by painting a nightmarish world haunted by fascist ideologies. In fact, Corbucci's depiction of the Old West was so lurid, stark, brutal and vicious that it made Leone's portrayal appear remarkably dull and placid in comparison.There's absolutely no doubt whatsoever that with Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino consummates his trademark style—built around the uncanny combination of gore, glamour, grotesquerie, and dark humor—which is often described using the adjective 'Tarantinoesque'. The movie's filming style also bears a striking similarity to Sergio Corbucci's sanguinary, majestic Spaghetti Western masterpiece: The Great Silence (1968). In Django Unchained, Tarantino fiddles with history (but falls short of rewriting it unlike his previous film Inglourious Basterds) to present his own perspective on several delicate issues mainly concerning slavery. Tarantino's naked display of uncorroborated brutalities associated with the inhumane practice of slavery, especially Mandingo as its extension has given rise to discontent among certain sections of the white community. Likewise, the movie has received condemnation from the likes of Spike Lee and Tavis Smiley for glorifying the n-word in the tradition of blaxploitation films. Django Unchained features special appearances from Jonah Hill, Don Johnson, Quentin Tarantino and Franco Nero who had played the titular role in the 1966 Spaghetti Western classic Django. Tarantino's imaginative direction is well backed up by some commendable acting performances from movie's lead as well as supporting cast. Jamie Foxx delivers his best performance in years, one that is perhaps bettered only by his Oscar-winning portrayal in Ray (2004). Despite bearing several similarities to his multi-lingual part in Inglorious Basterds, Christoph Waltz portrayal easily forms the backbone of the movie. Tarantino once again takes full advantage of Waltz's polyglot abilities and uses it to great effect at different points in the film. Waltz's Schultz is basically a representation of all those white men who raised their voice against slavery and contributed to its abolition. Behind his facade of a cold-blooded bounty hunter we discover a righteous human being whose superior intellect is well matched by his great sense of compassion. He inexorable resolve to rescue Broomhilda and his sacrifice in the end inexplicably brings to mind of the great sacrifice made by Abraham Lincoln. Schultz is a symbol of white men's conscience, courage and virtue in the same way as Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen is a symbol of Black men's pusillanimity, servility and hypocrisy. Thus, Stephen in many ways is Waltz's antithesis and the movie's true antagonist. And to Jackson's credit, he plays the part with great subtlety, guile and conviction. According to this critic, it's his best performance since Pulp Fiction (1994). Leonardo DiCaprio, in a rare negative portrayal, delivers a thumping performance as the sadistic Calvin Candie. A megalomaniac who dresses with the perfection of a fop, Candie is quite easily one of the most menacing Western villains of all time. Kerry Washington plays the part of the slave-girl Broomhilda—the only major female part in the movie—with exquisite charm.Overall, Django Unchained has its flaws and suffers from anachronisms and incongruities, some deliberate and some not so. But, Tarantino still manages to pack a strong punch. From the cinematic point of view, Django Unchained is undoubtedly a lesser work in comparison to Inglourious Basterds (2009). But the audacious yet effective manner in which Django Unchained retraces the history, fiddles with it, and presents its dark side makes it an important work of cinema. Django Unchained is unusually high on style, but luckily there's enough substance to keep an intelligent viewer interested. Highly recommended!A more detailed review of the movie can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,41,85,18 January 2013
Jurassic World," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An adventurous journey to the Spielbergian world of chaos and carnage
","Jurassic World is a 2015 American sci-fi adventure film directed by Colin Trevorrow. The movie's screenplay is co-written by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Connolly, and Trevorrow himself. Jurassic World stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Irrfan Khan, Vincent D'Onofrio, B. D. Wong, Ty Simpkins, and Nick Robinson in major roles. The fourth installment in the Jurassic Park film series, Jurassic World is a direct sequel to the Steven Spielberg directed Hollywood blockbuster Jurassic Park(1993). The film is set twenty-two years after the disturbing turn of events at Isla Nublar--an island off the coast of Costa Rica--which had forced John Hammond (played by the great English thespian and filmmaker Richard Attenborough), the founder and CEO of bioengineering company InGen, to abandon the theme park he had so painstakingly populated with ingeniously cloned dinosaurs. It's been ten years since Hammond's vision of a dinosaur theme park finally became a reality. The new park is named as Jurassic World and is owned by the Indian business magnate and dinosaur enthusiast Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) who has not only nurtured Hammond's dream but has also taken it to a whole new level.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing Masrani's team of bioengineers, led by none other than the genius scientist Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong reprises his role), have made tremendous progress in their research and are now able to genetically splice the dinosaur DNA at will with that of various other species, giving rise to a hybrid breed of dinosaurs. Masrani sees it as good business as these new varieties of dinosaurs tremendously add to the attraction of the park and keep the visitor rates from declining. So far, so good, but, for how long can one continue to bend the rules of nature? Sooner or later, we must all pay the price for our greed! It's an eventuality that Masrani and men must be well prepared for. For, according to Murphy's law, 'anything that can go wrong, will go wrong'. Things finally go out of control when Dr. Wu and team come up with a T. Rex hybrid in a bid to fulfill a corporate mandate. Voila! We are transported back to the Spielbergian world of chaos and carnage as the theme park slowly takes the form of a ticking time bomb, ready to go kablooey at any given moment. In a race against time, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a Velociraptor expert and trainer, and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the operations manager of Jurassic World must set aside their past differences and join hands to stop the impending doom that awaits them all.Indian actor Irrfan Khan as Jurassic World owner Simon Masrani Jurassic World is everything it is supposed to be and more. Needless to say, there is action, adventure, fun and frolic, and loads of creepy dinosaur mayhem. As one would expect, Jurassic World employs cutting edge CGI and VFX and the excellent 3D effects make it an experience of a kind. There's no denying that these technical factors make it quite unique in comparison to its predecessors. While the movie fails to match the cinematic brilliance of Spielberg's epic dinosaur extravaganza, Jurassic World nonetheless manages to fulfill its promise of being a perfect Hollywood summer blockbuster. Late American film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Jurassic Park: 'The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. But consider what could have been. There is a scene very early in the film where Neill and Dern, who have studied dinosaurs all of their lives, see living ones for the first time. The creatures they see are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. And that is the sense lacking in the rest of the film, which quickly turns into a standard monster movie, with screaming victims fleeing from roaring dinosaurs.' Ebert was perhaps more interested in the possibility of a constructive interaction between the humans and the dinosaurs. It's good to see Jurassic World finally take a few steps in that directionâ'as evident from the scenes wherein Chris Pratt's character tries to train the Velociraptors.Owen Grady trains the Raptors in Jurassic World Overall, Jurassic World can best be described as a visual feast for action-adventure enthusiasts. But, the movie does offer some nice and punchy one- liners. Perhaps, the best ones get delivered by Simon Masrani, the most impactful being: 'The key to a happy life is to accept that one is never in control.' Then there is one delivered by Dr. Henry Wu: 'Monster is a relative word; to a canary, a cat is a monster... so far we humans were used to being cats.' Jurassic World in addition to being a high octane summer extravaganza also serves to be a relevant critique on growing consumerism and corporate excess and mocks the human desire for profit. While the theme part is a manifestation of the human desire, the T. Rex hybrid certainly represents its worst side. The acting performances in the movie range from average to good. While Irrfan Khan makes his presence felt in the limited screen time he gets, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard add a spark to the movie with their solid performances. The rest of the cast does a decent job of supporting them. Jurassic World is a highly entertaining piece of cinema that takes us on an adventurous journey to the long forgotten Spielbergian avenues of madness and confusion, thereby allowing us to relive our childhood memories. Highly recommended! (This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)",8,8,19,12 June 2015
Once Upon a Time in America," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Leone's magnum opus and a testament to the free spirit of Art
","In order to cater to their everlasting lust for making money, the movie production studios have always endorsed the motto of quid pro quo – 'A favor in return of another'. Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur—by the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty—has had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality. At the beginning of his career, Leone got widely proclaimed as a master of technique and style as he added new dimensions to cinematography and screenplay. Leone's directorial debut was 'A Fistful of dollars'. Movie's success was marred when Akira Kurosawa sued the production house for plagiarizing Yojimbo. Leone bounced back with 'For a Few More Dollars'. He single-handedly reinvented the Western genre by providing a completely different perspective to the Old West, which was hitherto portrayed as the battle ground for the epic battle of virtue versus vice in the backdrop of chivalry and machismo. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', Leone perpetuated what would become his trademark: Spaghetti Western. Leone's distinctive style included juxtapositions, super close- ups, long continuous shots, and the rotating camera shots. Leone's collaboration with master-composer Ennio Morricone gave cinema some of its most mellifluous compositions. Once Upon a Time in the West elevated Leone from the position of a showman to a serious movie-maker—an auteur capable of much profound works. Leone refused a multitude of projects, including the opportunity to direct 'The Godfather', in a bid to realize his dream project.OUTA is an epic crime saga based on the lives of Jewish gangsters from their humble childhood in the ghettos of New York to their rise in world of organized crime. 'Noodles', 'Patsy', 'Cockeye', and little Dominic struggle as street kids in the East Side of Manhattan in the early 1920s. They work for 'Bugsy', a local gangster, until they meet 'Max' and decide to start an independent operation, triggering a series of incidents which changes their lives for ever. Robert De Niro as 'Noodles' gives one of the most subtle performances of his career. James Woods is chillingly menacing as 'Max'. Young 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly as 'Deborah' serves as a pulchritudinous delight for the sour eyes, and I say this as a testament to her ethereal, nymphean charm that was evident even at such a tender age. The rest of the cast gives a great support to the actors in lead with special mention of Elizabeth McGovern, James Hayden and Joe Pesci. The music is composed by Leone's long-time collaborator Ennio Morricone, who once again works his magic by creating music that is so plaintively divine that even Mozart would be proud of it. The film poignantly explores the themes of love, lust, friendship, greed, betrayal and loss of innocence in the backdrop of the 20th century America. For the European release, Leone cut down his original version to 229 minutes to appease the distributors. However, for the US release, OUTA was ignominiously edited down to 139 minutes by the muddle-headed studio personnel against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative was omitted as the scenes were put back in the chronological order. Many of the movie's most beautiful shots are not present in the shorter version, including the nigh magical sequence in which time-switching is indicated by the conjuration of a Frisbee. Movie's abysmal show in the US is attributed to this sabotage. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film again.The dreamlike screenplay of OUTA gives it a lyrical, almost hypnotic feel. OUTA is a tapestry of highly complex mesh work: the story depicts the lives of same individuals across three different timelines. The time-switching techniques used in the movie are so effective that the switching seems absolutely seem-less. The mystical ringing tone that the viewer gets to hear in the beginning of the movie provides a great subterfuge in unison with the dream-like finale, and adds surrealistic elements to the movie by raising doubts that the events depicted in the movie could well have been a part of a drug-induced dream that Noodles would have been experiencing under the hypnotic effect of opium. The movie has a multitude of unforgettable moments, which can be cherished again and again with the same levels of indulgence. The sequence in which little Dominic—caught between the want to satiate his newly attained puberty and the fundamental urges—buys a pastry to charm a neighborhood girl, but succumbs to the universal temptation and ends up eating it himself is pure gold. The scene which depicts Robert De Niro molesting his childhood love represents cinema at its most macabre. The make-up, set designing and costume designing are all top- notch. The make-up artists have gone about their business with such meticulousness that the actors seem to genuinely represent their character's age in each era. Overall, OUTA is a testament to Sergio Leone's dedication to the free spirit of Art. It succeeds at multiple levels and makes the viewer go through an entire gamut of emotions, keeping him engaged throughout. It is sanguinary and is surfeited with blood-cuddling violence that makes it unsuitable for the weak-hearted. OUTA, however, is as a must for the enthusiasts of the genre and the cineastes worldwide. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10,33,73,23 October 2011
The Last Samurai," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Pride and Honour
","The Last Samurai is a brilliantly crafted aesthetic pleasure, studded with supernal performances from Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise. In fact, Tom Cruise unarguably gives his best ever performance, surpassing his portrayal of Jerry Maguire in the eponymous flick. His plaintive portrayal of Nathan Algren, not only evokes pathos but also seeks sympathy of the contemporary viewer, who can vicariously relate to Algren's disconcertion, owing to his inner conflicts of patriotism vis-à-vis humanity.However, it is Ken Watanabe, who steals the show with his mesmerizing and poignant portrayal of Katsumoto, the leader of the last clan of Samurai. His screen presence and delivery is truly amazing and even outshines that of Tom Cruise, which is a compliment in itself. The scenes between Watanabe and Cruise are pure gold, depicting fluctuating feelings of hostility, compassion and camaraderie. Watanabe's intense and powerful performance in which he displays a wide range of emotions, is definitely worthy of the coveted statuette, but the academy never fails to disappoint. Watanabe's brilliant portrayal, not only mesmerizes the viewers, but also convinces the critics of his acting abilities. The tacit adoration between Algren and Taka (subtly played by Koyuki), enormously adds to the beauty of the movie. All this coupled with some brilliant cinematography and a mesmerizing score, makes it a treat to watch and a truly surreal experience.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,128,232,17 May 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Kubrick's swan song, and arguably his greatest
","Stanley Kubrick is unarguably Anglo-American cinema's most potent reply to the 'Fellinis', the 'Bunuels', the 'Bergmans', the 'Kurosawas', the 'Rays', and the 'Tarkovskys' of the world. Ubiquitously known for his inexorable yearning for perfection and uncanny innovation, Kubrick had managed to hold millions of viewers worldwide in a transfixion through his brilliant works for well over four decades. Regarded by Kubrick as his very best, Eyes Wide Shut is incredibly brilliant and sui generis. It's an elixir for the sore eyes; a panacea for the perturbed souls; a surreally psychedelic pleasure. Like most of his avant-garde works, Eyes Wide Shut is open to speculation and can be interpreted in a number of ways. Despite being rife with nudity, Eyes Wide Shut cannot be stigmatized or snubbed on the account of eroticism. On the contrary, it is aesthetic as well as thought-provoking. The movie incredibly manages to have a tremendous impact on the intellect as well as the viscera, asking incessant questions of the viewer while simultaneously haunting his thoughts and refining his imagination. The story revolves around a New York based doctor whose wife's confession of ephemeral infidelity perplexes him. Consequently, his chagrin and dudgeon drives him into a night of debauchery where he gets a lesson on sexual and moral enlightenment, which inexplicably saves him from an incipient turmoil. The cinematography is awe-inspiring to say the least and is well complemented by the plaintively haunting background score. The orgy scene, which is treated with contempt by many, is undoubtedly one of the most vivid scenes ever visualized or choreographed in the history of cinema. In fact, it is Kubrick's brilliant showmanship that makes it so very special. Tom Cruise is absolutely brilliant and convincing in the challenging portrayal of Dr. Harford and succeeds in having an enormous impact on the viewers and also manages to evoke their empathy. The nocturnal odyssey being rife with debauchery and decadence, ironically serves as a lesson of moral reformation. Nicole Kidman is ravishingly scintillating in her portrayal. The couple has incredibly managed to mirror their real life chemistry and tension on screen. The movie is a quintessence of cinematic excellence and can only be relished by discarding bigotry, conservatism and prejudice. The movie is a delectable feast and a must watch for patient viewers and lovers of avant-garde cinema. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10,81,129,8 December 2009
12 Years a Slave," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Steve McQueen's harrowing film about racism and slavery
","12 Years a Slave, a 2013 British-American historical drama film, directed by British filmmaker Steve McQueen, won the Oscar for the Best Picture at the 86th Academy Awards. Written by John Ridley, the Oscar- winning screenplay of 12 Years a Slave is based on an 1853 autobiography of the same name by Solomon Northup. 12 Years a Slave can best be described as a propaganda film censuring stigmas of racism and slavery in the antebellum United States. Made in the vein of the Blaxploitation films of the '70s, 12 Years a Slave is a powerful social commentary that poignantly depicts the heinous, racial exploitation of the Black people at the hands of their White masters who atrociously abuse them in more ways than any sane human being can possibly imagine.McQueen is known to infuse his films with a singular sense of realism that inevitably elevates the subject matter, pushing it to grapple with far more complex motifs than what it seems set to achieve initially. While his first two films - Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011) - were more personal and less commercial, his third film, 12 Years a Slave, even though it has many of McQueen's central elements of despair, solitude, lust, sadomasochism, etc., is his most accessible film. It's a pity that McQueen eventually lost the Best Director Oscar to Alfonso Cuarón.12 Years a Slave presents the heart-wrenching tale a free black man from Saratoga Springs, New York who is deceived, abducted and sold into slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the part with great conviction; the Oscar nomination was well deserved. Ejiofor is greatly supported by an all-star ensemble cast that includes the likes of Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Fassbender, Paul Dano, and Paul Giamatti.And while Giamatti, Dano and others are quite impressive in their respective cameos, it is Fassbender who steals the show, and if there ever were any performance that merited an Oscar statuette, it's Fassbender's mesmerizing portrayal of Edwin Epps - a sadistic cotton planter who prides himself in being a 'nigger breaker'. Alas, the Academy never fails to disappoint! Fassbender plays the challenging part with great aplomb, goes through a gamut of emotions, matching every ounce of unrestrained brutality with equal degrees of feebleness and abject vulnerability. Fassbender is easily one of the most talented among the current crop of international actors. Speaking of performances, Lupita Nyong'o deserve a special mention for her Oscar- winning portrayal of Patsey - a young female slave who is repeatedly raped and abused by Epps while working on his plantation.12 Years a Slave is not an easy film to watch, especially for those who are repulsed by brutality and torture. The graphic content of the movie can easily unsettle an uninitiated moviegoer. The gory and ostentatious manner in which the movie depicts the brutal slavery practices like flagellation and whipping places it in a very unique category of exploitation-cum-propaganda films.That being said, 12 Years a Slave is lifted by McQueen's able direction, powerful performances delivered by the movie's ensemble cast, a very different kind of a musical arrangement from Hans Zimmer bolstered by the use of western classical and American folk music, and Sean Bobbitt's sumptuous cinematography. Slavery may be a matter of past but human oppression, especially of the weak, in its various forms continues to plague our world which makes 12 Years a Slave quite relevant even in today's modern age. Serious viewers just cannot afford to miss it! 9/10A more in-depth review can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,3,5,20 April 2014
There Will Be Blood," There Will be Praise
","The world of cinema has seen and marveled a plethora of phenomenal performers, who over the years have entranced billions of viewers globally with their guile, grandeur, subtlety, eloquence and idiosyncrasy, but I dare say that none of their performances can match Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, for sheer ruthlessness, panache, eloquence and cheek. Being the chameleon that he truly is, Daniel Day-Lewis incredibly musters up all his prodigious talent as an actor to conjure up his misanthropic alter ego, Daniel Plainview, whose perpetually smirked face bolstered by his malice filled eyes makes him one of the strongest and the most fascinating characters ever caricatured on the silver screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game and virtually unstoppable as Daniel Plainview, a portrayal that not only resuscitated him as an actor, but also established him as someone who wouldn't leave a single stone unturned to bring his character to life and perhaps it is this very attribute that has helped him in his endeavor to be the absolute best at what he does. Paul Dano is absolutely brilliant as Eli Sunday and has complimented Daniel Day-Lewis in every sense of the word in spite of the fact that he barely had a week to prepare contrary to Daniel Day-Lewis, who had a whole year to prepare. Eli Sunday is ambitious, enigmatic, placid, pesky and pusillanimous and despite being highly contrasting to Daniel Plainview, ironically has many similarities to him, especially the uncanny demeanor that helped them both to inveigle others. It is the chemistry and the ever growing tension between them that makes the movie haunting and spectacular. There Will Be Blood is a morbid tale of greed, betrayal and obsession adorned by some great performances, visually stunning cinematography and masterful direction. Plainview owns a mine with potential silver deposits and his assiduity finally pays off when he discovers a silver ore. He sells it to acquire a crew to help him with the subsequent diggings in the mine. After the mine runs out of silver, oil is discovered in it and hence begins Plainview's journey of insatiable greed and morbid obsession. In order to acquire more oilfields and to strike out further deals easily, he adopts a young boy and names him as H.W. to help build a facade of a benevolent family man for himself. It almost takes him a decade to establish himself as a minor oilman, but this moderate success further intensifies his avarice. Subsequently, a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) visits Plainview's camp and offers to sell information about his family's ranch, which he claims to have an ocean of oil underneath it. Plainview and H.W. travel to the Sunday Ranch pretending to be on quail hunting while hiding their ulterior motive of verifying Paul's claim. Being as perspicacious as he was, it didn't take him long to find the vestiges of oil in the cracks formed due to the recent earthquake. He tries to inveigle the Sunday patriarch (who almost cried with rapture on hearing the offer) to sell him the land at a moderate price (which he calls quail price and not oil price), but is stymied by owner's ambitious son, Eli Sunday (also played by Paul Dano), who asks him to pay an additional ten thousand dollars towards the building of the Church of Third Revelation. Plainview reluctantly pays him five thousand dollars as advance and promises to pay the remaining amount once the drilling starts. Plainview assembles his crew at the Sunday Ranch and builds the first derrick. He also buys almost all of the land surrounding the Sunday Ranch so he will have not only those drilling rights but also the right to build a pipeline to the ocean to circumvent the railroads and their shipping costs. Eli wants to bless the derrick before drilling begins but Plainview rebuffs him. Using the money given by Plainview, Eli builds his church projecting himself as a preacher, faith healer and prophet. Soon the church has many followers, most of whom are Plainview's workers. Eli's increasing influence on the people and his display of false divinity starts pestering Plainview, who is further flummoxed by congregation's frequent gatherings (the daily prayers prevented the workers from taking desired rest, thereby decreasing their efficiency). Plainview beseeches Eli to make them less frequent, but Eli dismisses him with disdain. Plainview's ruthless ego is badly jolted by Eli's stubbornness and he brutally assaults him and even threatens to kill him when Eli asks him for the remaining money. Eli returns home all covered with mud after Plainview's assault and takes out his frustration on his myopic father, blaming him for acquiescing to Plainview's naked ambition. H.W. is deafened during an oil rig incident and starts behaving as a brat. Disconcerted by the change in the mannerisms of his son, he sends him away. Eli soon gets his revenge when a fellow named Bandy forces Plainview to get baptized at the Church of the Third Revelation (as a penance for a murder that Plainview committed and of which only Bandy knew). While baptizing him, Eli humiliates him by repeatedly slapping him and calling him a sinner for abandoning his hapless child. This incident further intensifies the hatred in Plainview and sets the tone for a deeply haunting finale when they meet many years later. P.T Anderson once again proves his mettle as a director and manages to pack a punch with this poignant and a deeply disturbing masterpiece. The movie incredibly succeeds on every level and entertains immensely, while still delivering a strong message. It was undoubtedly the best picture of 2007 and one of the best of the decade. In fact, it was very remiss of the academy to keep up with its long earned notoriety and prefer a relatively mediocre 'No Country for Old Man' over this truly haunting masterpiece.

Inception," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date
","Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,148,249,26 July 2010
Arrival," Boring and inconsequential film that tries to look down on its viewers
","I wish Arrival was half as good as critics around the world are projecting it to be. Hailing a movie as a masterpiece just because it is different is pretty much the worst thing that art connoisseurs can do.Apparently, the critics are raving about the Sci-Fi film because it takes a departure from Hollywood style of filmmaking. But departure alone is not enough. A movie should first and foremost succeed in elucidating the subject at hand for the audiences to the last detail. Arrival, for example, talks about certain symbols that the aliens seem to use and the protagonist who is a language expert slowly learns them but the viewers are never afforded that luxury. Right from the onset film assumes that the viewers are incapable of understanding such intellectual stuff. I mean our two protagonists are supposed to be two of the most intelligent professionals on the planet earth. One is a world renowned language expert and the other is a theoretical physicist. What is the probability in the world that an average viewer would be able to match that intellect? Well, for your kind information, that same average viewer has paid for the ticket. Some of the most intellectual characters ever created, including Sherlock Holmes, never let things unexplained for the lesser mortals.I don't claim to be as intelligent as Robert Langdon or Hannibal Lector, but I like to see myself as an intelligent film viewer and so I would like a filmmaker who tries to indulge me and not a filmmaker who doesn't think me capable enough to understand at least as much as his superintelligent characters. If Tarkovsky or Kubrick never thought lowly of their audiences, what makes Denis Villeneuve to look down upon the viewers? Besides, the film doesn't really offer anything that hasn't been done before in cinema.To make matters worse, it is boring and inconsequential. The strongest aspect of Arrival is Amy Adams. But she has delivered much stronger and dynamic performances over the years. Hollywood loves to make movies about female characters who look nervous and fidgety to begin with but end up showing remarkable courage in the face of adversities. Can there be an easier way of wooing half the human race? Well, to tell the truth, the female audiences are not gullible and filmmakers cannot fool them. He had attempted something similar in Sicario and he has done it again in Arrival. Hope Denis Villeneuve would be more careful with the Blade Runner sequel.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog 'A Potpourri of Vestiges'.",4,5,10,28 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Expected Virtue of Unrestrained Brilliance
","Alejandro González Iñárritu's Oscar nominated film Birdman, aka The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is a departure from the contemporary style of filmmaking. Iñárritu uses a technique that gives an illusion as if the entire film were shot in a single extended take. Birdman's strong albeit bizarre dialogue and impeccable slapstick timing on one hand hark back to the works of the American screenwriter and playwright David Mamet, particularly Glengarry Glen Ross, while on the other, it strongly reminds of the films like Barton Fink and The Player in that it deglamorizes Hollywood while exposing its hypocrisies.The movie tells the story of a washed up Hollywood actor—once famous for playing an iconic superhero called 'Birdman'—as he battles both his inner demons and outer enemies in a desperate attempt to reinvent himself as a Broadway director by staging a new adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story called 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'.Birdman offers a nice blend of realism, surrealism and magic realism. Vintage Iñárritu, Birdman doesn't feed any definitive answers but rather allows the viewers to engage at their own intellectual planes. While the entire cast puts up a brilliant show, Michael Keaton and Edward Norton deserve special mention for their sublime performances. For Norton, Birdman marks a return to form. As to Keaton, he delivers a performance so emphatic and complete that it can be easily described as the performance of the decade. One wonders what kept him from unleashing himself on the celluloid all these years.

The Silence of the Lambs," A Potpourr of Vestiges Review: Hannibal - The Cannibal
","Silence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study and a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and his improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter), almost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating himself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In fact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity while describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open glacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously equanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type sound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is chilling and Lecter's infamous 'Good evening, Clarice', is as enthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the shortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading category. Hopkins as Lecter, is incontrovertibly and incredibly at the top of his game and it is his brilliance that gets the best out of the other actors, especially Jodie Foster. In fact, it won't be a hyperbole, that Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs and more so in its sequel, Hannibal (which is my favorite of the series, as the story completely revolves around Lecter, giving him more exposure), is one of the best, the world of cinema has ever seen or offered. In spite of having some of the most gruesomely disturbing and viciously graphic sequences, Silence of the Lambs, is one of the most decorated and enthralling movies of all time. A must watch for avid fans and eclectic viewers.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9,25,53,24 April 2009
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The high-octane second installment in the Hunger Games film quadrilogy
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the much-awaited sequel to the 2012 blockbuster, The Hunger Games, which was based on the second novel in Collins' acclaimed The Hunger Games trilogy—a young adult science fiction series set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic districts of Panem under the ruthless control of a totalitarian state called the Capitol. With several actors reprising their roles from the previous film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has an ensemble star cast that includes the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Woody Harrelson.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is set on a much grander scale in comparison to its prequel. The plot picks up from where it was left in the first movie with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes chosen from District 12, being declared as the joint winners of the 74th Hunger Games under dramatic circumstances. The shocking turn of events which saw the emergence of not one but two winners for the first time in the games' history seems to have infuriated President Coriolanus Snow who is adamant on teaching Katniss and her kin a painful lesson. What ensues is a whirlwind adventure of epic proportions that will shake the very foundations of the residents of Panem and the dictatorial regime that governs it.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire gives great attention to the technical detail. But, what makes it stand out is the meticulous manner in which it seems to tackle the emotional aspects which often seems to be lacking in such films. The credit for this must go to the director for eliciting worthy performances from almost all his actors and the screenwriters for adding a great level of maturity to the plot by the virtue of a multilayered narrative while keeping intact the thriller and mystery elements of the novel.Speaking of movie's technical elements, it's imperative to talk about Alan Edward Bell's taut editing and Jo Willems' breathtaking cinematography. While Sutherland, Tucci, Hoffman, Harrelson and Wright are brilliant in their respective roles, it is Jennifer Lawrence who is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. It's an absolute delight to see her go from strength to strength, completely unfazed by her recently acquired super-stardom, continuing to deliver one strong performance after another with such aplomb that one usually associates with great thespians.Overall, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire offers entertainment galore. It may not be great cinema but it's definitely much superior to the run-of- the-mill Hollywood productions that are all style and no substance. Catching Fire is a high octane extravaganza that also offers some food for thought for those who are willing to look beyond the obvious. Catching Fire serves as a powerful social commentary in that it highlights how the strong tend to oppress the weak when in absolute control of things. We have a real entertainment feast at our disposal and it's only prudent to savor it to the fullest. 8/10",8,6,24,20 April 2014
Ran," Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic
","Ran is probably cinema's greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic, ironically coming from an oriental film-maker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. The story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son's audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son's impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn't feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa's brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. A must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended: 10/10.",10,56,70,3 July 2009
Jackie Brown," Quentin Tarantino's most mature film till date
","While not necessarily his best, Jackie Brown is easily the most mature, most complete, film Quentin Tarantino has made till date. No other Tarantino film can match Jackie Brown's storytelling, character development and realism. The movie accentuates Tarantino's love not only for cult/obscure films and pulp fiction novels but also for the forgotten movie stars.By handpicking two washed out actors like Pam Grier and Robert Forster to play the major parts in Jackie Brown, Tarantino, a self- confessed admirer of both of theirs work, took a huge big but his faith in them didn't go unrewarded as both deliver superb performances with Forster even getting his first Academy Award nomination. The memorable performances of Grier and Forster are well backed up by the rest of the cast: Samuel L. Jackson once again plays an N- word loving hit-man to a tee, only this time it is more repugnant than Pulp Fiction. Michael Keaton plays an ATF agent with his usual frenzy. Robert De Niro effortlessly essays the part of a sociopathic ex-convict. And Bridget Fonda skillfully plays a drugged-addict moll. Rarely does anyone miss a keynote. Tarantino's brilliant choice of stock music further adds to the movie's experience. The direction and editing is absolutely top notch. Tarantino doesn't spoon-feed the audience and delivers an ending that certainly keeps the avenues open for some of the major characters.

Spectre," An attempted homage to the Bond films of yore
","Spectre, the 24th film in the celebrated espionage franchise based on British author Ian Fleming's larger-than-life superspy, marks Daniel Craig's fourth outing as James Bond. Directed by British filmmaker Sam Mendes who previously directed Skyfall, Spectre reintroduces the supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld—the criminal mastermind heading the terrorist organization SPECTRE (now referred to as Spectre) and the archenemy of James Bond—after an absence of four decades, owing to a legal dispute, since the character's last credited appearance in Diamonds Are Forever (1971). In Spectre, Blofeld (with background and character significantly altered) is played by the two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz. While Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, and Naomie Harris reprise their roles from Skyfall—that of M, Q, and Moneypenny, respectively—Spectre also stars Italian actress Monica Bellucci (who makes a brief appearance), French actress Léa Seydoux, and former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista. Spectre weaves the story lines of the previous three Bond films— Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall—together with an overarching story arc that reveals Blofeld as the grand architect of all the evil that has pervaded Bond's life including the deaths of Vesper Lynd (Bond's love interest played by Eva Green in Casino Royale) and Olivia Mansfield aka M (the head of MI6 and Bond's superior, a recurring character, played by Judi Dench). After completing an unsanctioned mission in Mexico City ordered by the previous M through a posthumous message, Bond learns about a secret terrorist organization named Spectre. Bond is hell-bent on exposing the evil genius behind the organization but he is grounded by the current M who is furious with him for disobeying his orders.M already has his hands full as he is facing opposition from Max Denbigh (played by Irish actor Andrew Scott) aka C—the Director- General of the Joint Security Service, a merged organization of MI5 and MI6—who wants to close down the '00' section. Bond once again defies M's orders and travels to Rome, with some assistance from Q, where he gatecrashes a Spectre meeting and identifies the leader of the organization as a ghost from his past. Bond barely escapes the clutches of a dangerous Specre assassin named Mr. Hinx (played Dave Batista) and finally meets his old foe Mr. White (a former member of Quantum, a subsidiary of Spectre, played by Jesper Christensen in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace) on his deathbed. White tells Bond that he has grown disillusioned with Quantum and asks Bond to protect his daughter, Dr. Madeline Swann (played by Léa Seydoux), who can lead him to Spectre. Bond gives him his word just as a dilapidated White blows his brains out. Bond must now protect Swann and convince her to help him reach Spectre and the criminal mastermind behind it. Spectre does have its moments but it is one of the weakest of the four films starring Craig as 007. The culprit is its weak storyline and a runtime that's the longest ever for a Bond film. Pierce Brosnan sums it up perfectly: 'I thought it was too long. The story was kind of weak — it could have been condensed. It kind of went on too long. It really did (Spectre) is neither fish nor fowl. It's neither Bond nor Bourne.' While there is no dearth of thrill and adventure in here, the suspense quotient is surprisingly low especially despite being projected as the final missing piece in the puzzle that would unlock the mystery that binds the four films together. A grimmer ending on the lines of On Her Majesty's Secret Service could have worked better. However, the action is topnotch and the fight sequences featuring Daniel Craig and Dave Batista are the movie's real highlight.Overall, Spectre proves to be a worthy addition to the James Bond film franchise but unlike Casino Royale and Skyfall it fails to leave a lasting impact. Spectre is an attempt on the part of the makers to pay homage to the classic 007 movies but the execution only reflects their confused state of mind. Ever since Daniel Craig stepped into the shoes of Bond there have been deliberate efforts to project not only a different kind of a Bond but also a different brand of 007 films. Skyfall gave us hints that the makers are finally trying to revive the old 007 motifs. With Spectre this shift looks rather forced and without proper planning. Out of a sudden the new generation of Bond lovers has been forced to content with a tacky potpourri of the old and the new. While Skyfall was a pleasant surprise, Spectre comes across as an anomaly of sorts. The creative think-tank must quickly decide if it wants to return to the classic 007 elements or build upon the new ones that Casino Royale brought in. One of the strongest points of Spectre is Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography and the movie's opening sequence is pure brilliance: while it gives the impression of an uncut tracking shot, it is actually was accomplished with the fusion of several meticulously crafted long takes with a little bit of CGI. While Daniel Craig is solid as ever, Christoph Waltz fails to be at his menacing best. The real culprit of course is weak writing and not Waltz. In fact, both Craig and Waltz deserve better from their writers. Léa Seydoux's Dr. Swann certainly has the looks to kill; it is the more ravishing that the French beauty has ever looked on the silver screen. Despite its aforementioned shortcomings, Spectre serves as a pleasant viewing experience and is a must watch for the Bond movie enthusiasts.(This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)",Null,16,32,22 November 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A formidable anti-war film elevated by a sublime performance from Andrew Garfield
","Hacksaw Ridge is a formidable anti-war film that's closer to popular war films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon than anti-war masterpieces like Full Metal Jacket and Paths of Glory. The film is elevated by sublime performances from Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, and the lovely Teresa Palmer. Mel Gibson is certainly back with a bang and seems to be following the footsteps of Clint Eastwood. All we need from Gibson now is a Revisionist Western. Speaking of Gibson, his choice of including the archive footage of Private Doss and other survivors from the Battle of Okinawa helps add a lot of weight to the film. With as many as 6 Oscar nominations to its credit, Hacksaw Ridge is certainly one of the biggest films of the year. Apart from the brilliant screenplay and direction, it is Garfield's performance that makes Hacksaw Ridge what it is. 2016 proved to be an incredible year for Garfield who delivered not one but two great performances-- the other being his turn of a stoic Jesuit Priest in Martin Scorsese's Silence. It's an interesting coincidence that in both these films, Garfield played a Christian pacifist. A real pity is that Garfield didn't get a second nomination for his sublime performance in Silence which is even better than his brilliant turn in Hacksaw Ridge.Hacksaw Ridge looks set to win the Best Editing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. A win in any other category would be a real bonus.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog 'A Potpourri of Vestiges'.",Null,1,5,19 February 2017
The Great Gatsby," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Baz Luhrmann's monumental adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus
","The Great Gatsby is a 2013 drama film directed by Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann, based on a 1925 novel of the same name by the great American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's novel is best remembered for its hallucinatory portrayal of the Jazz Age through the microcosmic world of glittery opulence kaleidoscopically enveloping the extravagant but hollow way of living that underlines the ethos of the American Dream. Fitzgerald's scurrilous satire on the zeitgeist of the tumultous 1920s, The Great Gatsby explores several conflicting motifs like love, materialism, sacrifice, self-indulgence, extravagance, idealism, stagnation, upheaval, ostentation, modesty, etc. And Luhrmann's movie, to its credit, succeeds in capturing the novel's motifs in essence, if not in totality. The Great Gatsby presents the tale of a young, enigmatic, seemingly profligate millionaire named Jay Gatsby whose ideals of love come across to be so virtuous and pristine that they seem to be modeled upon none other than Don Quixote himself.The Great Gatsby despite its flaws proves to be an unforgettable cinematic experience for an intelligent viewer. The Great Gatsby, being the quintessential Luhrmann extravaganza, is quite high on style but fortunately there's enough substance to keep a keen-eyed viewer interested throughout. Fitzgerald's masterful storytelling seems to gel quite well with Luhrmann's showmanship. The manner in which the movie blends elements of drama, suspense, romance and tragedy is indeed exemplary. Simon Duggan's breathtaking cinematography brings the movie to life. Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Carey Mulligan are brilliant in their respective roles and in that order.The Great Gatsby is neither a typical Hollywood product nor an art house movie. It is for this reason it is difficult to categorize as a film. And perhaps that's why it opened to mixed reviews in Cannes early this year. If anything it's a movie that requires patience and would most definitely satisfy the cravings of the patient lot.For more, please visit my film blogsite:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",8,0,3,10 September 2013
Furious 7," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Every bit as fast and furious as some of the franchise's previous installments, if not more
","Fast & Furious 7 (aka Furious 7) is every bit as fast and furious as some of the franchise's previous installments, if not more. Fast & Furious 7 showcases adrenaline pumping action from start to finish with Vin Diesel once again leading the juggernaut as the macho anti-hero Dominic Toretto. From LA to Tokyo to Azerbaijan to Abu Dhabi, the movie is high octane and absolute carnage and it features some of the coolest heart-stopping fight as well as chase sequences seen in recent times.If you are excited by fast cars, hot chicks, badass dudes, and exotic locations then Fast & Furious 7 would certainly impress you. Like with most action movies, the plot is secondary and what happens is of little consequence vis-a-vis how it happens. While the heroes are larger than life and the villains don't get any meaner than this. Jason Statham is a great addition to the franchise and his presence as the story's antagonist immensely adds to the thrill and excitement.In Fast & Furious 7, Paul Walker is quite impressive in sadly what is his last screen appearance. He will certainly be missed. Michelle Rodriguez is kickass as ever as Toretto's love interest Letty; the chemistry between Rodriguez and Diesel is electrifying. In one of the movie's most scintillating fighting sequences, Rodriguez battles the American mixed martial artist and judoka Ronda Rousey. The raw intensity of the entire scene (given that Rodriguez herself is a trained boxer) makes it absolutely breathtaking to behold.Although, he gets less screen time than usual, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes his presence felt in Fast & Furious 7 (all thanks to his hulky physique and great comic timing). Another actor who deserves a special mention is Kurt Russell who is easily the movie's biggest surprise package and an absolute treat to watch. It's a role that can be seen as a tribute to some of Russell's memorable performances in the Action flicks of the '80s, particularly the movies directed by John Carpenter. The supporting cast is solid as ever.While the action can be nonsensical at times, it is great fun to see men fight like machines, and at the end of the day we can't really complain. Can we? Well, who can nitpick at the sight of a sports car jumping from one skyscraper to another? Who can be bored by the sight of a half-a-dozen cars getting jettisoned from an airplane? Who can be turned off by the sight of two alpha males beating the hell out of each other in a street fight of sorts? The bottom line is that Fast & Furious 7 is supposed to be an Action feast and action is what it exactly delivers. It is a very strong contender to be adjudicated as the best film of the franchise, thus far. Fortunately, the action never gets to the point of being obnoxious like so often the case with the films from the Transformer series. Fast & Furious 7 is the perfect Summer Blockbuster from Hollywood; the movie has set the benchmark for the upcoming Action films this summer. The movie's greatest USP is that it is exactly what it is supposed to be, no less or no more.(This review was first published in my film blog A Potpourri of Vestiges)",7,5,23,2 April 2015
The Godfather," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus
","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10,78,152,29 September 2008
