Angels & Demons," An Exciting, More Fascinating Sequel to 'The Da Vinci Code.'
","While I enjoyed 'The Da Vinci Code,' it was a bit slow-going for the most part, though the actors did a good job of keeping the film interesting for the most part. But for the sequel, 'Angels & Demons,' the filmmakers have created an exciting sequel with a story that is more fascinating than the one of its predecessor, in my opinion. Tom Hanks is once again in top form as Robert Langdon, and the supporting cast, including Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Armin Mueller-Stahl, is excellent. The storyline may seem a bit convoluted at times, but the fast pace, fine storytelling and terrific performances make up for a lot. Overall, this is a superior sequel to 'The Da Vinci Code' that fans of the novel, and regular movie-goers, will surely enjoy! Grade: A-",9,0,0,7 June 2010
United 93," A Powerful Motion Picture
","After seeing the exceptional TV Movie 'Flight 93,' I didn't think that any film, even a theatrical feature, could match the power and emotion of that film. But Paul Greengrass has proved me wrong with his powerful new film, 'United 93,' the first theatrical film to be made about the events of September 11, 2001. The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing this heroic true story to life. The use of hand-held 'shake' cameras give it a very documentary-like feel to it. There is also no dramatic embellishment as well; all we see is the passengers and crew as they attempt to re-take their flight from the hijackers who are hell-bent on killing hundreds. We are also there as air traffic controllers and military personnel attempt to find out what is going on, and to get a hold on the situation. Greengrass has crafted a masterpiece that not only serves as a great companion piece with the TV movie 'Flight 93,' but also serves as a reminder of the heroism that saved our nation's capitol.

Cloverfield," Definitely Lives Up to the Hype.
","After months of media hype, the J.J. Abrams-produced 'Cloverfield' finally hit theaters, and the movie definitely delivers. 'Cloverfield' is, without a doubt, the best monster flick yet made! I won't go into details about the plot, but it is very intense, exciting, and quite scary at times, with good performances from a terrific cast. The use of a P.O.V. style of film-making makes this film all the more believable. I won't go into detail about the main monster, except to say that it is fantastic! The only spoiler I have is this: along with the main monster, there are also hundreds of little creatures, and they are terrifying to behold as well! This film definitely puts 'Godzilla' to shame. This is a terrific film that fans of sci-fi, horror, and monster films will want to see! One of the best ever made! Grade: A+",10,2,6,18 January 2008
