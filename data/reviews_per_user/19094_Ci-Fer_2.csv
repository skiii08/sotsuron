The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash!
","Finally the Hulk movie we were all waiting for. Apparently. Don't get me wrong as a huge fan of the Hulk (comics, TV-series) i've been waiting a long time for this. The pace of the movie is spot on for an action movie - seldom a moment when something 'Incredible' isn't happening.However I think this may be the biggest problem with this film - Letterier seems to have been so determined to deviate from the 2003 Hulk that where Ang's version was so over the top character development with bits of great action thrown in - this new version is completely the opposite.Every fan of the Hulk should definitely see movie - the acting, locations and script (most of the time) are great - both Norton and Roth are a delight to watch. I rank this in the top 5 comic book movies I have seen. I just wish there was a little bit more to this movie.Then again there's always the inevitable sequel.",7,2,6,14 June 2008

","Firstly I'm going to say it...yes this is the best Bond film I have seen to date. In regards to all the reviews which seemingly label this as an awful movie I wonder whether we have we seen the same movie??There are so many elements in this movie that come together and feel just right from the beautiful set locations to the outstanding performances including the movie's main antagonist Silva, who in my opinion delivered a genuinely sinister yet engaging performance (not unlike TDK's Joker).That's not to say this is the best action movie to date as it does suffer from a very few fundamental flaws (pacing issues, plot holes) however as Bond films go this is certainly worthy of the name",8,2,11,26 November 2012
