The Avengers," Time To Jump On The Band Wagon
","Yeah, much like everyone else, I friggin' LOVED this movie. This is the purest comic book movie I have ever seen, and for that reason alone it works. Everything, from the writing to the action to the humour to the chemistry between characters to even the pacing feels like it was pulled straight from the pages of the lavishly ludicrous, and having one of the gods of cult sci-fi/fantasy, not to mention a comic book writer, at the helm of this movie was probably the only way this movie could have possibly met with everyone's expectations.4-5 years of build-up to this movie, and it more than just pays off; it wins the jackpot. I am yet to find a person who didn't like this movie, and I can fully understand why. I honestly TRIED to find something about it to even nitpick at, and found nothing. This is the ultimate comic book movie; I highly recommend this to any lover of action, superhero or sci-fi movies, as well as to any avid comic book readers. For all those who don't fit into these categories, this movie may just convert you.",10,29,55,12 May 2012
Hugo," Dear Cinema.... Love, Scorsese
","This is quite possibly the most beautifully made films of the last 10 years. Admittedly, I had reservations about Scorsese being able to do a family film; A well-known and respected director of organized crime films deciding to do a family-friendly film? Sounds a bit too close to Francis Ford Coppola's Jack. I have, subsequently, begged forgiveness for thinking such nonsense.Every aspect of this movie, from the camera angles to the editing to the acting to the writing, is just another word in Scorsese's 2 hour long love letter to the art of filmmaking, and the entire production sparkles with it. It is heart-warming, it is funny, it is touching, it is intelligent on various levels; in short, it is everything a family film is meant to be, done not only right but brilliantly right at that.For all those cinephiles out there, both old and new school, I highly recommend you check this movie out.",9,2,5,12 May 2012
Drag Me to Hell," Don't believe the hype
","I don't understand it. Why is the movie liked so much? Sure, it's okay, but this is just ridiculous. The special effects are tacky, the female lead Christine looks like she's in the middle of high school, the 'hallucination' scenes were bizarre and the overall plot was just average.I stack this movie next to Stephen King's Thinner in terms of plot development: Cross a gypsy, and expect to die. Of course, in 'DMTH', the reasoning is just stupid. She's being evicted from her house because she's behind on her payments, and the lead won't extend her mortgage. Okay, Christine mentions that the gypsy has a grand-daughter she can stay with, it's not the end of the world. So she curses Christine, who just doing her job, to hell for all eternity. Overreacting, much! Okay, to be fair, she dies soon afterwards, but that's more likely to be caused by plot convenience than not having a home.One of the aforementioned 'hallucination' scenes involves her getting a nosebleed... of tidal wave proportions. Okay, first off, no-one is concerned about her and more worried about the boss who gets sprayed on. Yeah, because that makes all sorts of sense (!) Secondly, she loses a LOT of blood in this scene, and she just runs out in embarrassment. I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure she would have passed out, if not died, from that. And before anyone cries 'It's a camp horror/comedy like in Evil Dead', this is not camp! It may be a comedy, but it isn't intentional.That being said, the movie isn't horrible. It's mediocre, but it isn't horrible. The story's pretty solid, even if the reasoning behind it isn't, the acting is good, and I have to admit, I did get a few jumps from time to time. Although, given one of those jumps involved a friggin' handkerchief, some of them were pretty weak. Overall, the movie is given way too much credit. See it if you want, but don't go out of your way to do it.",3,1,3,7 October 2010
Dark Shadows," Welcome Back, Burton
","I really liked this movie, and I am seriously confused about why everyone else seems to hate it. Yeah, okay, it's nowhere near perfect: Having the daughter be a werewolf? Pointless. Having Bonham Carter give Depp a blowjob? Stupid. Having Elfman on music once again, and yet using mostly 70's music for the soundtrack anyway? Confusing. The sequel baiting at the end with Bonham Carter being alive? Annoying.BUT, with that said, the acting is really good, the story, while definitely leaning on clich√©'s wall, didn't take EVERYTHING it could of and actually came through in some areas, the effects were quite impressive, and the humour, while probably not to everyone's tastes, got a few chuckles out of me. While the music isn't all Elfman's, it's still a good soundtrack that works with the movie, and Elfman's own still has the punch it always does. And hey, Alice friggin' Cooper, how could you go wrong?Given how far Burton could sink in terms of remakes (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, Planet Of The Apes, Alice In Wonderland), I saw this as being at least able to stand on its own. No, I haven't seen the original show or movies.Burton is one of my favourite directors, and after having been less than impressed with his last few movies, this is seems like a return to form, however gradual. I recommend any fan of his check this movie out, and to everyone else... Just let us have our fun.",7,5,12,12 May 2012
