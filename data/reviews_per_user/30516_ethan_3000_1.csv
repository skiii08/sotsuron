Skyfall," Stunning!
","I went to see this film on the premier opening night at the Xtreme Screen At Vue. Full capacity, sold out and excellent atmosphere. The whole film is just a wow factor throughout. Daniel Craig's grittiness matches the dark essence of the film. The acting was spot on throughout and the effects could not be flawed and were some of the very best I have ever seen. It feeds into previous bond films showing respect to the 50 year anniversary of the biggest franchise in the world.Light humour every known and again gives the audience a sense that the film is not taking itself to seriously. Overall this film is simply a must see movie, and arguably the best bond film of all time, except for gold finger.",10,6,22,26 October 2012
