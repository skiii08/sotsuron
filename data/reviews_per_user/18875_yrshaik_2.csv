Blade Runner 2049," Bland, boring and oh so disappointing.
","Being a fan of science fiction movies and an even bigger fan of the original Blade Runner, I had been eagerly awaiting this installment only to be severely disappointed. This installment was boring, way too long and lacked any of the appeal of the original. The appearance of Harrison Ford towards the latter part of the movie did little to redeem this pointless rehash of a classic.",3,2,4,7 January 2018
Split," Neither horror nor thriller
","To call Split a horror would be an insult to horror movies. In fact, this movie is not even worth the title of thriller. It's boring, it drags on and on to its conclusion which is a real anticlimax. I'm a fan of horror. I love my slasher movies full of blood and gore. I love my supernatural movies creepy and scary and I would expect a thriller to keep me at the edge of my seat. This movie fails to fulfill any of these expectations. Watching paint dry would probably be more exiting!",1,60,147,1 May 2017
