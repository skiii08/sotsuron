The Devil's Advocate," WOW! Very Excellent
","Some people say this movie is not of the horror genre, but it is. It might not be a slasher movie but it definetly brings on some intense scares. The cinemetography is beautiful in this film and the digital effects are stellar.Everyone played their parts well, but of course Al Pacino was the best. I can't think of anyone else to play the devil in this part.
So it kinda resembles Rosemary's Baby, but not quite. If not for that part of the story, the plot would fall apart. This movie is not for everyone. I warn you in advance. Younger children should not view this movie. Probably high schoolers and above, it is ok for. There is a lot of nudity and some scenes of sexuality and a little language here or there making this movie an R rating. I have read other reviews of this movie and they say Keanu can't do a southern accent. Well, I come from Florida and I think everyone pretty much did a good job with the speaking. Florida's southern accent is different than somewhere like Georgia or Alabama.--SPOILER AHEAD. DISCONTINUE READING OR SKIP TO THE END--Some people say the ending was a bit weak, maybe it was, but it would be really hard to end with a big 'boom.' The director led up to the the ending with such intensity and then kinda ended weakly. But I think the ending was extremely good. You couldn't end it any other way. It was a real blow to the head.--END END END--Overall i think this movie deserves an 8. It was very entertaining and dramatic. The acting was superb. Definetly worth watching.",Null,0,0,14 October 2000
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Excellent...Party On
","hey, it's a classic. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves play their parts perfectly as 2 air-head teenagers in highschool. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is indeed very Excellent. Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu) must pass their history project or they will fail. Ted will be sent off to military school. This could possibly be the end for Bill & Ted's band, Wydle Stallions. Definitely worth seeing. After you have watched this, make sure to see Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.'Party On, Dude!'",Null,0,0,30 August 2000
The Replacements," Pretty Cool
","Some people aren't giving this movie enough credit. Yes it is another football movie. But with style. The jokes are funny and not repeated, a little bit of action and of course Keanu Reeves. I really don't enjoy the game of football that much. But this movie was quite a nice change of pass.A loose take off on the 1987 football strike. when football players decided that they don't play unless they get paid, replacement players are brought in. Yes the movie is predictable and can't be compared to other movies, but it's light hearted and doesn't take much to think about. Definitely worth see.'I will survive'",9,1,2,30 August 2000
