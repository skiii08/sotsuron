The New World," Different and breathtaking.
","It was a so exciting film for me. First of all, it was so different from the other films which were in the cinema at the same time. It was based on images and sounds, not words. However it could tell me what it wants to tell. I felt it under my skin through my veins. The story was familiar but i have never felt it like this before. In addition, it was not only a girl's story, but it was also a nation's, a 'new world''s story. The people who came to see a war or some action were bored and most of audiences left the cinema before ending because film was quite slow and long. Acting was interesting, you will see that many people you do not expect very much will surprise you. To sum up, it was an extraordinary film and if you want to see something meaningful, I recommended it.",10,1,4,3 April 2006
Inside Man," Superb!
","If you like 'Ocean's Eleven' or 'Italian Job', that can be your new favorite film. I like it because I like smart robbery films. Clive Owen was shining despite the mask that he was wearing during the film. In addition, film includes lots of political message but it doesn't disturb you. The story is very well and the musics are unbelievable! The music which plays at the beginning of the film shows you what kind of a film you will watch. There is not very much action so do not expect to see super visual effects etc. There are many other action movies if you are a fan of action films. This movie will take his place in my DVD archive, I am sure I will be never bored while I will be watching this film.",7,3,4,6 May 2006
