Hereditary," Slow. Extremely anti climatic. Waste of time.
","I am left wondering if the glowing 10/10 reviews are fake or people are growing increasingly used to terrible movies and the bar is set extremely low. The good:Acting is believeable 
It looks great
The music is creepy The bad: If you enjoy actual horror, then this movie will leave you bored and even laughing at times. Fyi The humour is not intentional.Long drawn out moments with the music blaring. They needed to cut at least 30-45 min.Long stretches of nothing actually happening.Plot is a hard meh. Nothing new. 
Conclusion I think it would have been passible with some scenes either shortened or cut. It would have made the movie roll along and kept the 'creepyness' theme going. Unfortunately they decided to go with drawn out scenes with creepy music and less substance.",3,2,6,14 August 2018
