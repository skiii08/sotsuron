The Expendables 2," 'Track 'em, find 'em, kill 'em'
","A film so poor that reviewing it seems almost redundant. This was the first movie I've ever walked out on. The corny references to Terminator, Die Hard and Rambo were too much to stomach. Half of the dialogue seemed to be dedicated to setting up 'jokes' (for lack of a better word), and Chuck Norris' cameo seemed almost satirical. Unless you enjoy a film with incomprehensible, gap-filled plots and actors well past their expiry date, then Expendables 2 is not recommended. I can only assume that when Stallone's character says 'Track 'em, find 'em, kill 'em', he's referring to the person who wrote this movie's script.",1,17,33,30 August 2012
