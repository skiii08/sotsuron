The Avengers," Pure piece of entertainment
","Couldn't stop laughing for its witty humor. The whole Cineplex was just quivering with the clapping sound in each flash of action :p Though the starting with introduction part was a bit shaky; quick entrance of superhero conflict action just swabbed that flaw :p Initially Iron Man dominated over the screen; but HULK utterly stole the show after his unleash :p He's always angry and that's the little secret of him :p His wrathful countenance, furious attitude, broad grin, turbulent smash and punch, the way he thrashed Loki repeatedly-----AHAAAAAAA ♥ Beside the appearance of Hulk and Iron Man, other heroes of Avengers seemed as only some effective sidekicks. Loki was well enough to trouble all with his villainy. Special-effects and action sequence demand applause. Desiring keenly for its sequel :)))",8,3,8,3 August 2012
Conquest 1453," epic creation, but flawed
","The storyline depicts the conquest of Constantinople in the hand of Muslim Sultan Mehmed the second. The thousand year defense of Christian empire just collapsed within 54 days of war. This is the most expensive production in Turkish film history, incorporating a huge cast of extras. However, this great Turkish effort can not surpass the flawed script, history contamination, poor acting, toy special-effects, unnecessary love scenes. Sultan Mehmed should be more engaging in the script in his way to conquer Constantinople. But still somehow I enjoyed the film conveying no boredom and rather thanks for this epic creation :)))",7,2,6,4 November 2012
Skyfall," The most grand part of the film was Javier Bardem's stunning performance
","After getting the blueray, again watched the film. Adele's profound vocal in starting credits also sank me into the deep ocean of amazement :p Undoubtedly Skyfall will grab an Oscar for this original song. Sam Mendes did a distinguished direction to sustain the Bond character alluring before us. Some twists and wits were really great. Daniel Craig again succeeded in his role with his perfect Bond attitude___The most grand part of the film was Javier Bardem's stunning performance which made him one of the best Bond antagonists. The new Q was not enough engaging. If you are willing to seek the sensuous Bond girl, it would be vain :p Here old Judi Dench as M seemed the Bond lady with her glowing acting and I was fully cherished with her recitation from my fav 'Ulysses'---'We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'",8,6,14,1 February 2013
42," illuminates humanism against racism____
","The storyline follows an American true legend in the major league of baseball history. It depicts Jackie Robinson's historic entrance as the first black player in US baseball league in 1947 with the enlightenment of anti-racism. The movie is too much intriguing; teemed with inspirations. It should be noted in the bunch of all greatest sports movies.Harrison Ford, as Branch Rickey who took such brave step to sign a negro, was outstanding in his performance throughout the film. Ford must get an Oscar nomination for this powerful supporting presence. He remains amazing in his role to plant belief and inner peace in the core of Jackie. What an elegant show from the oldgun!!!!Chadwick Boseman comes well to portray his tolerance against the intolerable racist assaults upon him from his fellow teammates, players of other teams and spectators. Nicole Beharie, as his wife, firmly supports Jackie to tackle all odds with perseverance. Even the whole cast appears flawless in their acting. However, commending musical score lifts the emotional and inspirational level higher while watching the film. Baseball scenes are also shot realistically. To sum up, this fine piece of essence thoroughly illuminates humanism against racism____",8,1,1,3 July 2013
Argo," it, seemingly, came quite unfair as Ben did not get Oscar nomination for his distinguished direction
","During American hostage crisis in Iran in 1979, a 'B' grade sham sci-fi film named 'Argo' was planned to rescue six US embassy employees who took refuge in the Canadian ambassador's residence. Ben Affleck, as a director, represented the political history ravishingly with his well-detailed approach. He dealt with the conflict keeping a balance as he opened his narratives remarking American's evil portion to make Iranians do this revolution. As the protagonist, Ben also seemed engaging with his life- risking efforts to exfil them in the disguise of film crews. Arkin and Goodman dazzled in their comical yet patriotic roles in support. Rest of the cast also furnished the movie with their realistic acting to enhance its credibility. Suspense aroused intensely in the script and sound-sync was subtle. However, it, seemingly, came quite unfair as Ben did not get Oscar nomination for his distinguished direction.",8,0,1,17 January 2013
Ted," some top-notched entertainment for me and made me wish for a Ted also in my life :p
","The story is about a talking teddy bear who has remained the best buddy of a 35 year old man from his childhood. Ted, with the voice of Seth MacFarlane, acts just like a funkiest person who always frenzies to make raw humor, bake pots, bang trollop, crack out at party :p It made me burst into laughs at its dialogues :p In some scenes, I really had to roll over my bed; especially the best scene was that Mila Kunis grabbing hooker's stinky feces from the floor. Mark Wahlberg is grand at his comical functions; while Mila Kunis does not appear as just smoke alarm as in previous movies. Ted, being a very own closer being, also draws some emotional setting in the script; though that appropriate emotion is vividly missed at the end. Notwithstanding this blemish, it was some top-notched entertainment for me and made me wish for a thunder-buddy Ted also in my life :p____",8,0,4,8 November 2012
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," not as good as Rang de Basanti___
","Obviously this movie is a milestone against the cheesy course of Bollywood. Farhan Akhtar once again proves him a hard-working actor as he inherits the character, Milkha Singh. He is the core of this long 3 hours. Songs get A-. However, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's direction is a big okaay; but not as good as Rang de Basanti. It still fails to ignore the typical Indian approach; flawed by overdrama at several places, hilarious howdy romance!!!! Sonam Kapoor can not cope with her role.Overall, an admirable attempt to portray such inspirational character like Milkha Singh.",7,1,4,22 July 2013
Man of Steel," it is a bit messy too; however my expectation might be higher a lot!!!!
","Yaap, it is the best of all Super Man films with blistering action and impactful score. But it is a bit messy too; however my expectation might be higher a lot!!!! Zack Snyder seemed floppy in his path of direction which might get his less concentration than casting dark action effects. Screenplay could not satisfy me also despite a fantastic modern reboot story. I am admittingly disappointed for such loops!!! Coherence and 3D output had also aches___Henry Cavill passed darn well as a macho Man of Steel and made good countenance in some places. His struggle against his insurmountable alienation in the society gripped realistic approach to portray. Amy Adams was not given much slots to act!!! She should be used profoundly in the film. Russell Crowe gave extreme charm as Jor-El in the beginning to heave the hype to top. Planet Krypton's framework was so angelic in view!!! It was visually blissful and whimsical. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, as Kent couple, rendered emotional touch in the character development of young Kent. Michael Shannon as General Zod was superb in his clash with Superman. But his villainy was perfectly justified for his desperation and cruelty to save his own race, Kryptonians. This part of the script enthralled me :)) Zod's sidekick Faora-Ul also showed amusing aggression towards Superman :p___The action sequences absorbed tantalizing pace to stun my eyes. Supersonic battle of mights between Superman and Cryptonians was as ferocious as spectacular. For sci-fi action flick lovers, it is an obvious recommendation. Moreover, Hans Zimmer did not frustrate as usual. His musical score enhanced steering the thrill :)))___",8,1,3,1 July 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," wellzzz, it was not such extra-ordinary movie to create the hype of getting the massive eight Oscar nominations!!!
","Pat and Tiffany, two emotionally broken and mentally slight disturbed persons came across and knitted their romantic silver linings to the way of their sound life's playbook. Terrific performance from Bradley Cooper as he was the heart-content of the film :p De Niro was also there to draw another 'Limitless' appearance with Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence took just another firm step in her promising career. Anupam Kher was pretty good also in a major role!!! David O. Russell, in his vibrant direction, brilliantly deals with the mentally special ability issues. Yeahhhh, Surely Cooper played one of the best leading roles in 2012. But wellzzz, it was not such extra-ordinary movie to create the hype of getting the massive eight Oscar nominations!!!",7,1,3,13 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Marc Webb looked to be more concerned with representing Spider Man's earthly features rather than the script
","If I count the 3D effects of this film, it can achieve a big Okay. But as a movie compared to previous Spider Man films, I have to assert it as the worst of this Marvel's spider version. Marc Webb looked to be more concerned with representing Spider Man's earthly features rather than the script. Though he pulled some major changes in the story of earlier productions such as casting Stacy instead of Mary Jane, bringing the Lizard in antagonist role; still Webb, seemingly, paid his most concentration to make Spider Man more humanistic following Nolan's philanthropy in Batman series. I couldn't be satisfied with the maladroit over-acting of Andrew Garfield as before. Irfan Khan's short appearance and departure came as vague. But Emma Stone's acting was emancipated from these glitches despite having just a commercial heroine role. The way Parker turned him with the suit was quick and quirky. Overall, this so-so super hero movie could not reach my high expectancy____7/10",7,1,3,5 November 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," An amazing Disney production that seems to have slightly smart touch of Pixar :p
","'I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be....Than me'______'I don't need a Medal to tell me that I'm good, coz if a little kid can like me, how bad can I be?' :D____Ralph, a video game antagonist, who was upset with the treatment of his negativity, set an adventure to prove himself a hero towards his fellow game characters. An amazing Disney production that seems to have slightly smart touch of Pixar :p Characters' development was well-crafted and the relation between Ralph and adorable Vanellope was quite cute and stirring. Both John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman made a worthwhile voice cast :p Despite unnecessary romantic elements, a full pack of fun and emotions___",8,2,2,16 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An excellent prelude of another amazing trilogy :p
","The mysteries of middle earth are being murmured :p Precious Gollum is back on the screen :p Peter Jackson did not frustrate me at all. His fantastic direction again made me plunge in the ravishing adventure at dark ages. His significance in detailed characterization is what I liked most. In each section of cinematography, music, visual effects, makeup and setting, Hobbit made home-runs. Martin Freeman was terrific as young Bilbo while the Thorin Richard earned top-notched performance. Though some questioned about the length of the movie with the relevance of story, I could not lose my gaze for a single moment and had to utter after finishing the film, if it were a bit longer :p An excellent prelude of another amazing trilogy :p___",8,3,7,1 March 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A mesmerizing visual journey along with Wes Anderson's palatial intellect
","That's why cinema is still regarded as art. A mesmerizing visual journey along with Wes Anderson's palatial intellect. Wes is blossoming his artistic mastermind day by day and TGBH, with no regard, is his best creation. Colorful and spellbound setting throughout the film again provides his eloquent vision. Unique representation with uncanny humor remains his style as always. Ralph Fiennes, as M. Gustave, appears completely in an unmatched role and deserves an Oscar nomination. Johnny Depp was first thought to be in the character and in his absence, Fiennes has just nailed it. All other star actors, along with Gustav's sidekick Zero, also flawlessly feature in the feast of whimsical Wes.",8,1,3,5 June 2014
Behind The Candelabra," Both of them amazingly remain so energetic and comfortable in love making scenes to discomfort me at success :p
","This biographical movie portrays the private life of prominent piano- player Liberace, who was greatly renowned for his exotic dressed stage- performance but miserably died of AIDS, and his intimate relationship with his gay-mate, Scott. Michael Douglas delivers an Oscar-nomination worthy appearance to sail Liberace's showmanship and spectacular life in style with more of a way of perfection. Matt Damon, as usual, claims his highly potential acting aptitude in all gay-mantic and conflicting moments with Liberace. Both of them amazingly remain so energetic and comfortable in love making scenes to discomfort me at success :p I have to admire Soderbergh's clean, plain direction and of course, all efforts for extravagant makeup, set designs and costumes. This film has already bagged 3 Emmys and will definitely impact on Oscar juryboard.",7,0,0,26 September 2013
Django Unchained," Vintage violence and graphic gunfight belong to the unique style of his flick as usual :p
","A witty bounty hunter unchains a slave, Django (D is silent :p) to help him in his hunt and eventually makes him his bosom bounty partner. After a lucrative bounty business throughout the winter, they come to meet a ruthless plantation owner to free Django's wife from his slavery. The blood-shedding classic western style is back with the hand of Tarantino :p Vintage violence and graphic gunfight belong to the unique style of his flick as usual :p The entire cast carries out top-notched acting whereas Christoph Waltz becomes the best of all :p His powerful performance with jovial nous is definitely worth an Oscar nomination in supporting role once again :p DiCaprio also glitters in his negative feature as a greedy, brutal landlord. Strikingly Samuel L. Jackson appears villainous with his sly and dreadful countenance. And the protagonist, Django Foxx vibrantly adapts himself with the Quentin culture. Tarantino tremendously pulls and mocks the American society's dark and cruel attitude towards slaves. His script is both intense and insane with brilliant repartee; while OSTz are even ace to suit with the sadistic sequences to amuse us. The remarkable use of flowers in murder- scenes adds more blaze to beauty :p To sum up, Tarantino undoubtedly unfolds an immense power pack of epic entertainment through Django :p___",9,0,3,8 January 2013
Lincoln," Though its not Spielberg's best piece......
","The plot focuses on Abraham Lincoln's toiling efforts during long blood- costing civil war to pass the 13th amendment to eliminate slavery. Daniel Day-Lewis renders an Oscar-worthy acting appearance as Lincoln with his flawless gesture and voice. He is pitch-perfect to portray Lincoln's witty, firm and earthly characteristics. Besides, Tommy Lee Jones, Strathairn, Sally Field and actually the entire elite cast demand a huge round of loud laud for their ravishing performances. The voting session-- Yay--Nay seems too engaging with overwhelmed incitement. In addition, the scene where Tommy hands gift to his wife moves me most with deep emotions and pleasure. Though its not Spielberg's best piece, he elegantly succeeds to place his another supreme historical creation before us with well- detailed direction.",8,1,2,29 December 2012
Hotel Transylvania," visualization, graphics become my eye-soother
","Count Dracula runs Hotel Transylvania in a dark, ghastly forest far away from the human world to protect his sole daughter from humans. The hotel is also treated as a merry zone for other monsters as they, along with their family, come every year to celebrate the daughter's birthday. The Dexter's Lab-creator, Taratakovsky keeps his splendid direction immune to make my time blithe :p The visualization, graphics become my eye-soother. Voice-sync, pop ostz, other classic horror characters like Frankenstein, Invisible Man, Wayne---all can not stalemate my mirth for a single moment :p The story also fantasizes me with immense fun and slight emotional turn :p Nevertheless, my joy-scale could contrast to other ratings; it still earns from me 9/10___:)))",8,0,1,12 January 2013
Les Misérables," Les Miserables would score Oscar as the ace-flick :p
","After finishing for the second time, my feeling is like being marooned in the nineteenth century-France by the elegance of Les Miserables. English Literature student, Tom Hooper made an accomplishing task to choose and direct the eminent novel Les Miserables. He perfectly transformed the story into the musical narratives with bravery. Two Aussies, Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe were as always splendid in their roles---protagonist Jean Valjean and antagonist Javert. Especially as Hugh's magnitude of acting was too grand; it must be the 2nd mightiest leading characters in 2012 after Daniel Day Lewis. Anna Hathaway, in her little but the most catchy-tragic appearance, won all hearts and emotions and would win surely the Oscar in best supporting female role too :p Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also glowed to render comical relief brilliantly :p Amanda Seyfried and Eddie were just pitch- okay with their performances. The cinematography, OSTz, costumes, society of that period, French Revolution setting----all came as well- crafted. In my notion, if Oscar were not biased with the American sentiments around 'Lincoln', Les Miserables would score Oscar as the ace-flick :p",9,3,5,14 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Another big blow from the dynamic duo
","The story spans from the tragic 911 incident to the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. Jessica Chastain, stiffly, plays the protagonist's role as a young CIA Agent Maya whose deep determination and an eight-year endless efforts lead her to the trace of bin Laden for hunt. Through slow detailed process, the plot grows to its peak gradually and engulfs enough tension during the Operation Neptune Spear to spear bin Laden. The dynamic duo--Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal--once again deal with a powerful, complicated plot to generate an extra-ordinary creation. An impressive blend of Bigelow's well-detailed direction and Mark's intelligent script___",8,7,23,8 January 2013
The Conjuring," Indeed a rare gem in the horror-genre
","Renowned paranormal investigator-couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, just before probing their famous 'Amityville Horror' case, visit a countryside home, teemed with demonic ferocity, and risk their life to salvage the whole family from evil clutches. Despite the slow-burning beginning, soon the film turns well-paced with its fearsome features. The movie setting perfectly pays panegyric to the 70s' horror movies. Sound effects and cinematography produce spine-chilling impacts. James Wan's direction is so intense and intriguing that it makes me sweat even in AC and causes stomach ache!! Wan vividly establishes him as the pathfinder of modern horrors. He knows meticulously how to frighten viewers with his treatment of satanic approaches and how to play with their fearful instincts. Wan sharply blends the same-old clichés of a haunted house and devilish possession that do not earn disfavor from me. I have to be impressed at how he tracks the paranormal movements and claims the terrifying outputs. Actors make their task well; especially Lili Taylor, Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga capture the major show. The movie brings diabolical fever upon me literally. Indeed a rare gem in the horror-genre and would be treated as an ever-green classic as we reckon 'The Exorcist' still.",8,2,6,8 October 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Another beatific triumph of Christopher Nolan
","Another beatific triumph of Christopher Nolan. Another grand creation that proved this great director's supreme grandeur in this age of Cinemas. The script, as usual, was top-notched with rounds of Nolanish twists. Heart-knocking back-score made me conceive its grave thrill. Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Kaine, Morgan Freeman needed no new mention as they remained firm and intense with their characters. Anne Hathaway, Levitt, Marion also allured the screen in the new additions. Tom Hardy, as Bane, cast a winsome spell for playing his 'necessary evil' role to prepare Gotham for ashes. It had to be mesmerized with his husky-marvy articulation, ironical dialogues and eye-sighted acting. But I reckoned him after Joker and Ra's Al Ghul; since seemingly Bane could not surpass Joker's epic masterful insanity and Ghul's visionary appearance. Fight scenes, in addition, were poorly staged. If I ranked the trilogy, the arrow would be like---->The Dark Knight--->Batman Begins--->The Dark Knight Rises. Though little frustration grabbed me for some while after finishing the film owing to pinnacle of enormous expectation; this was undeniably an unforgettable cinematic experience :))) And again thanks to Nolan vai for such masterpiece :p",9,2,11,18 November 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Unique and applauding direction
","A whimsical elopement of two young lovers :p I got submerged into their splendid adventure throughout the movie :)) Cheerful supporting roles, played by all mighty actors :))) Passionate background score with superb narrative technique. Unique and applauding direction, drawn by Mr. Fantastic Anderson. Mesmerizing with a cute-charming love tale, he cleverly depicts dismantled family-bond, misfit teenage, orphanage reality, adult seclusion--such pragmatic issues. Fearing no doubt, that magical kingdom should be treated as one of this year's best films :-B___NB: its a must-watch for all who were scouts in school :p",8,0,3,5 November 2012
Flight," a super-notched performance to play a perfect tipsy role and solely carries the plot with elegance
","An excessive alcoholic pilot makes a successful plane crash and heroically saved almost all people on board. But later during investigation of that flight, he starts to fight against his dark drunken nature to disprove his intoxication as the cause of crash. Zemeckis is superbly back to the real mainstream world after a long era :p The storyline is excellent and bears a deeper message about the prohibition of alcohol and drugs!!!! The flight-crash scene takes too much engrossment to make thrilled :p Denzel Washington appears again at his best. He provides a super-notched performance to play a perfect tipsy role and solely carries the plot with elegance :D",8,0,0,29 December 2012
Looper," An ace sci-fi flick based on the theory of time travel and telekinesis
","In the futuristic world of 2074, a mafia boss, known as Rainmaker, sends his hitlisted people 30 years back through time machine and there some hit men, termed as Looper, are fixed to execute them. An ace sci-fi flick based on the theory of time travel and telekinesis :))) Rian Johnson earned a huge high-five for his detailed direction and splendid script though it seemed to be slightly inspired by Terminator and Blade Runner. The entire cast's acting was great; especially the little kid, Cid just stunned me with his paramount performance!!! Indeed this year's 2nd best sci-fi after Avengers :p And a must-watch for all sci-fi lovers :)))",8,0,3,4 November 2012
Cloud Atlas," epic makeups and costumes will undoubtedly claim accomplishment in Oscar
","Six different timeline stories bridging from nineteenth century to faraway post-apocalyptic future. Parallel portray of all stories prolongs carrying concept of afterlife and human journey to eternity for justifying the vision--'Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others.' Wachowski Broz, along with Tom Tykwer, cast an stunning direction by using the outstanding novel to set a visionary and philosophical plot. Each dialogue made me ponder its depth, its connotation. Complex and mind-groping script plays with thoughts regarding basic human instincts---love, greed, treason, fear, bravery, salvation. Marvelous cinematography with whimsical score surpasses all dark complexions and complexities. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant and so forth--exquisitely adapt multiple (positive/negative) roles in various timescales in variant genders. Their epic makeups and costumes will undoubtedly claim accomplishment in Oscar. I've already watched 3 times at a stretch and each time my wonder becomes an abyss more and more ;))) Surely this year's best essence to me :DD___",9,3,6,31 December 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Surprisingly awesome :p
","Surprisingly awesome :p At length after so many years I found a thrilling horror flick with such firm story.Another stupendous script from Jose Wheddon. In the beginning, it seemed just like a typical zombie film. Later, I was shattered with those unpredictable twists and freaking climax turn :p Intense direction from Goddard and pretty good token of acting also. Relished the trump entrance of my favorite Sigourney Weaver :pDespite lacking enough scary stuffs, it was a hellish show with unique tale to become a MUST WATCH for all horror-lovers :)))) Eagerly waiting for its sequel___8/10___",8,0,1,5 November 2012
