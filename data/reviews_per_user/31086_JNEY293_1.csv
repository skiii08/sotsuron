The Benchwarmers," Great Movie
","This was a great funny movie, one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time. I actually laughed out loud several times! All of the cast was hysterical! Great movie for all ages! This movie had the most one liners and many memorable scenes I've ever seen in one movie! Although the movie could've been longer it still was the funniest and definitely a movie I'm gonna be seeing a lot more times! Jon Heder, played a paper boy, who was really funny. Now I'm just wasting space cuz i don't wanna spoil anything. If u liked Napoleon Dynamite, Anchorman, or any movie that made u laugh, u'll definitely love this movie! Whoever voted anything under 8 is a loser and doesn't know funny stuff!",10,0,4,9 April 2006
