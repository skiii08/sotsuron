Moneyball," OK movie.. but in my opinion overrated
","I am a huge baseball fan, and I realize that baseball movies are rarely so subtle as Moneyball. In most baseball movies, the team is in a slump and everybody is striking out, or dropping easy fly balls. The team is winning, and everyone is hitting home runs. At JUST the right time at the end, unusual players step up, the hero comes through and the team wins the big game. Kudos to Moneyball for breaking that mold and daring to be different and real. Moneyball is more intelligent than most baseball movies, and Pitt handles his role well as the uncompromising GM. The likable Jonah Hill again plays... the likable Jonah Hill. Which is OK. Everyone did OK, and the movie is watchable. The problem I have with Moneyball is that it's not all that interesting or memorable. The moral of the story is, I guess, that statistics are important in baseball. Um, ... OK. There is no huge conflict that is resolved here, there is no danger, no love interest, no... etc. To me, this is not the 'wow' movie some people make it out to be. It is merely .. OK. An hour after watching the movie, I wasn't really left with any memories or impressions, good or bad.",6,0,0,26 February 2012
The Hangover," Best Comedy since Animal House
","I almost gave this movie a 10. But comedies are hard to do, and there are some slight imperfections. The characters were not really well defined before the fun starts. It might have been a little more interesting if we'd known more about the groom and the best man, who I guess was a bad teacher who doesn't like kids? Not sure. Anyway... that's not what this movie is about. In short, I loved this movie. My wife and I laughed our heads off. It has a great ear for the way people talk, and the one-liners fit well into the story and connect with the personalities of the characters. I love the way it starts the morning AFTER (hence the title) and the characters have to piece back together what happened. I guarantee this- you have never before been so compelled to stay seated for the closing credits as you will be for this movie- I wont say why. I laughed HARD from start to finish, and VERY strongly recommend this comedy to anybody who has just once understood what it was like to party JUST a little bit too hard....",9,1,2,1 August 2009
Unbreakable," M. Night Believes his Press
","I loved the Sixth Sense. I had heard this movie had gotten mixed reviews and that some people loved it. Strong premise certainly- a man finds himself indestructible, and there's another man who is at the other extreme, and whose bones break constantly. A man looking for a hero- the reverse of himself. OK. We watched it with an open mind, expecting a decent movie. I have to say, this is the slowest, dullest movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it dull, but it off the scale in terms of pretentiousness and self-importance. It's one of those movies where, if you think it's dull, then you're just not intelligent or you just 'dont get it.' The actors all seem to sleep through their roles here, like they're waiting for the ending to come, just like we were. Too many artists (in all media) with breakout successes follow it up with a second effort that is overblown and misses the point of what made them successful. Unbreakable is a perfect example. What a pointless mess, with the big M.Night twilight-zone 'TWIST' at the end... hit me like, OK, yeah, I get it. Nothing NEAR the impact of the twist, and the conclusion, of the Sixth Sense. His next effort, Signs, is an underrated movie that gets better when you see it a second, third time. After that... M. Night's career just spiraled out of control. Most of them are formulaic and borderline-unwatchable. It's as if he is desperate to re-create the magic of his first movie, but clueless how to go about it. If he gets another chance- and anyone with the vision to create an amazing movie like The Sixth Sense should have as many chances as they'll give him- I hope he goes back to what made that movie great. Snappy pacing, great acting, intricate plot that rewards the audience consistently, ending that ties everything together and satisfies while shocking at the same time.",4,0,1,27 March 2010
Yes Man," Ex- Jim Carrey fan
","This was not only one of the worst Jim Carrey movies I've seen- and I've seen them all... it is one of the worst FILMS I have seen in the last few years.Some reviews I read here are quick to forgive how 'formulaic' this movie is... and I am a sucker for a good formula. I enjoy a good romantic comedy too. However, a rom-com should be EITHER romantic or funny, hopefully both. This was neither.The romance was completely unbelievable, no chemistry whatsoever. Carrey acts disconnected, and while he is not over the top, the comedy seems desperate... not insane- funny like he used to be, I mean his Dumb and Dumber character was even endearing, and I loved that movie. Here, he is just... dull. Then he transforms and he is... still dull. The primary thing about this movie here is, I don't believe it. I am a pro at suspending disbelief to enjoy a movie... but here, I didn't believe one phony minute of the entire movie. For example, in one scene, he is following the girl of his dreams, and she says 'stop, get away from me. Farther!' and he literally runs, brushing his friend aside, sprinting away in the middle of a busy airport. Because, you see, she asked him to go away, and he must obey. OK. There was some nervous laughter in the theatre as if people felt some obligation. Another time he gets in a fight in an alley and ... nothing either funny or dramatic happens. Actually that pretty much explains the whole movie. I'm not saying that you really need anything special to happen... I mean I like guys just sitting there talking sometimes, if the dialog is witty and the characters are likable and believable (e.g. 40 year old virgin, knocked up, Seinfeld the classic TV example, etc).NO spoiler here but I felt the ending was a final, fitting, nose-thumbing to the audience from the imagination-less buffoons that obviously think that just trotting poor Carrey out there doing the same old thing would be good enough for us. What they forgot however, is you need a plot, decent writing, a believable situation, dramatic tension, jokes or at least some form of humor, and chemistry between the actors. I felt sorry for Carrey in this movie. Nothing wrong with him... he did his best but there was nothing here to work with.That's 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back- even worse, it felt like twice that.",3,12,23,26 December 2008
Bird Box," Watchable but stupid
","The movie was watchable only because the story was so simple, and you had to see where it went.
Sandra Bullock was OK, she does make average movies a little better, but I really hope she slows down on the plastic surgery. Her face is now an almost expressionless mask. Watching a 54 year old pregnant woman is a little silly, even when in most scenes and the right lighting she can pull off 42. Time to play your age.
The movie is a ripoff of 'a quiet place' only this time you can't open your eyes. I guess the next one you will need to plug your nose to avoid smelling the aliens. Or maybe use unscented deodorant so they can't smell you. Or WHATEVER.
The gimmick is laughable, all the way to the stupid twilight zone cosmic twist ending. Give me a damn break.
Also, what was the purpose of having them carry the stupid birds around in a box when they didn't even warn them ONCE about the creatures being near?
Just a ridiculous, stupid, half-hearted waste of time, utterly devoid of imagination or creativity.",5,3,6,8 January 2019
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble with the Movie
","First, let it be known, I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan. From his Westerns including the amazing 'Unforgiven' to his startling and touching directorial triumphs including Mystic River, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of our Fathers, etc etc. Given his well-earned iconic status, I find it sad that he chooses the brain-dead 'Trouble with the Curve' as one of his later appearances. The dialog I would put on a par with 'Expendables 2' which is to say horrendous. Poor Eastwood, Adams, Timberlake, Goodman, and other fine actors are forced to spout ridiculous dialog that seems to have been written by a 10 year old. Watching the film, we found ourselves laughing at the dialog in in appropriate places, paying attention to how poorly made the film was, rather than even following the story. The story seemed to meander around, first being about Eastwood needing some player to start hitting to keep his job... but then they just drop that plot to make it be about something different... then at the end, they bring everything back together again, tying it into a ribbon without any further explanation or emotional investment earned. The baseball is terrible also. The home run hitter guy is obviously not an athlete, much less a 'five tool' superstar. Other players, who are supposedly at the triple-A level, especially the narrow shouldered, bespectacled player who precedes the slugger in the batting order, are characters more out of 'Bad News Bears' than a real baseball movie. The peanut vendor turned star situation is too ridiculous to even comment further on. The ending, as contrived as it is, provides a small amount of satisfaction, but even that is spoiled by Lillard's ridiculous overplaying of the villain, and more even more inane and pointless dialog. I hope very much that we see Eastwood in movies more deserving of the status he has earned. 'Trouble with the Curve' hits a single simply through its stellar cast, but is thrown out trying to stretch it into a double, aiming for far more than the skill of the writers, editors and producer are able to deliver.Everyone involved in this hollow and artificial shell of a movie should be more than a little bit embarrassed.",4,16,25,26 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Eh... Pretty good.
","I thought The Hobbit was... pretty good. It was a nice visit back to Middle Earth. A little drawn out (three movies... really?) but at the same time, the characters besides Bilbo and Gandalf remain very thinly drawn. A week after seeing the movie, I am not really left with much to remember about them. One was very fat. Great special effects, of course, and Gollum was amazing. The scene between Bilbo and Gollum is by itself almost worth the price of admission. I will see the other two movies, but I'm not NEARLY as excited about it as I was with the original trilogy movies. Judging by the first film, this is but a shadow of those films- not just in terms of scope (since The Hobbit was a quieter book to be sure), but also in terms of heart. With all that film time, the spell that has been woven to date is not very compelling. Been there, and doing it again, half-heartedly.",6,3,10,26 December 2012
The Hangover Part II," One of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen
","My feelings about this movie might have been because of how much I loved the Hangover. But... I would rather actually BE hung over than be subjected again to the Hangover II. I consider this not only one of the most disappointing sequels ever made, but I consider it to be on a par with Ishtar as one of the worst A-list MOVIES ever made. The Hangover II was a flat-out disaster, a mere shadow of the first movie. It had no inspiration, no comedic writing, no subtlety. The plot was artificially contrived to get the people - ALL the people back together again for a cash-out. The only laughs are from grossness and shocks; some of the humor is just sick. It's not believable, and just plain not funny. There was not a second of this movie that didn't have SELLOUT written all over it. If I had seen it in the theater, I might have actually walked out. I actually feel a little bit less respect for each of the otherwise excellent actors in this movie, and I wonder if it hasn't actually hurt the career of Zach Galfinaikis.",2,2,5,27 February 2012
The Artist," The Artist - A difficult movie to review!
","I thought The Artist was: brave, real, unique, daring. This movie is very simple on the surface, but makes many powerful statements in its simplicity. I believe it will stay with me, fresh in my mind, whereas many other movies I've seen recently will fade quickly away. The only somewhat negative is that it was a tiny bit predictable- I wish the plot would have been a bit more complex and surprising. And this is what brings me to the paradox of reviewing this movie. The simplicity is really part of the point of the movie- and in some ways I was happy for the broad emotions and the few straightforward intertwining arcs of the plot. It takes you back to experiencing what it must have been like when movies were new, and it makes you realize both 1) how far we have come, and 2) what we have sadly lost in the evolution of the art. So many movies babble on, little jokes, pointless dialog about things that matter to pointless characters. This movie had very few words in it, if any... but told a story as timeliness and universal as any movie ever made. While it was a silent- style, black and white movie, it felt fresher and more lively than many other color films with millions of dollars spent on visual and sound effects. And the lead actors, such charisma! Such talent! Like the stars of old Hollywood. One more thing; you just gotta love the little dog.",8,1,4,4 March 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Like Bad Popcorn
","Like bad popcorn with too much 'golden liquid' added... this movie is fun for awhile, but ultimately leaves you with a sick, bloated feeling. And, bloated this movie is. Smaug dies early on in the movie, and the whole movie is basically one prolonged battle scene. While the battle starts out well, with lots of promising buildup, it rapidly descends into unbelievable nonsensical coincidental freakish stunts, each meant to outdo the previous ones. It's like the battle for Middle Earth from LOTR3 on steroids, stretched out for an extra hour and drained of any real dialog, emotion, or character depth. One example: gigantic earth-eating worms are introduced before the big battle. I guess the orcs are happy about that, because maybe these worms like the orcs better than the men/dwarf/elf team? I'm not sure how or why, since they don't seem to have eyes. Anyway, the worms show up and dig up some dirt and the men/dwarf/elves are like OH NO! WORMS! and then... nothing. They don't appear again, and they serve no purpose. Did they create holes for the orcs to travel secretly? Did they kill anyone? It's never made clear. It's as if Peter Jackson expects us to just marvel at the sight, and be satisfied, as if we don't deserve logic or motivation. We walked out of the movie discussing how ridiculous it was that the whole third movie seemed to have very little with the book, and what a rip-off it was to stretch THE HOBBIT into so many hours of unnecessary, brainless and completely unbelievable fight scenes. In my opinion, this movie is good looking, and partially watchable, but then descends into an embarrassing, smelly, gigantic pile of troll droppings.",4,2,6,29 December 2014
