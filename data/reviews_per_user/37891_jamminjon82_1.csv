The Ring," Wow
","It's been years since I've seen a flick as scary as The Ring.  I was definitely intrigued by the whole movie.  The scene of the girl in the closet with her face warped was burned into my mind for the entire movie and definitely disturbed me.  The tape itself had me wondering the entire time what it was all about and I absolutely loved the way everything fell into place.  Alot of movies leave me wondering well what about that or this, not this one.  The ring thoroughly explained every question that I had or would have had.  Overall it was a great movie with great visual and audio effects on getting blood pressure up.  The storyline was killer and I felt tired after this movie from sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time I was in the theater. 8stars out of 10",Null,1,1,5 March 2003
