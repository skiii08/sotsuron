Creed," Drag and too dramatic
","I am a big fan of Rocky series.. like wise all action movies. This movie was a big drag, and was trying to pull Rocky out nothing. I have seen much better movies which keep you on your toes, Michael B. Jordan is OK, most of them praised for his skills and i would say he did his best. Ryan Coogler could do much better job on story and direction. Sound track helps movies like this if it had a effective sound and great timing. Look at actually Rocky, one of most important factor was its sound track which gave goose bumps.Well to my own conclusion.. its waste of time.",4,1,1,3 March 2017
Aquaman," One more Super Hero/King
",Time pass movie.. worth watching once.. Don't go with high expectations. Just confused with what happens when Aquaman poops in that sea or Ocean.. Just asking.. Nicole kidman last scene catching up with Temuera Derek Morrison was bit over rated.. The way she runs in to his arms was bit gayish.. Why kill the buzz..,6,0,0,29 January 2019

Godzilla," When Godzilla Poops
","The story is.. Godzilla gave a blow job to director, asking for casting in movie.Director was so satisfied that he actually end up making movie on it. Why is it ? that every other movie i watch.. world ends up in crisis and US turns out the be heroes and save the world.. while.. rest of the world is praying watching News.. i would suggest... just skip to end and watch last 15 mins.. u will be more than happy.. Cheerios..",2,1,2,28 September 2018
