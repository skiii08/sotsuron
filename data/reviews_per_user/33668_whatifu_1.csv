Sucker Punch," (Insert Catchy Title about getting Sucker Punched)
","SPOILER ALERT!!In all honesty, this movie was one out of a dozen with decent CG. Now that's out the way, sitting throughout this movie was a big waste of my time and I hope you won't take the same route I did.First - The plot of the movie didn't have one damn thing to do with the medieval, martial arts and Nazi styled war fighting scenes. If you asked me, they were pretty unnecessary in every way possible. I mean the medieval scene was basically 'Lord of the Ring' in 5 minutes. The manager or 'Boss' of the mental home in my opinion tried too hard to seem like a bad guy. He didn't have the looks for one, his acting was horrifying and I wasn't moved by him at all.LET ME GET TO THE OVERLY USED SLOW MOTION OF THE FILM, I swear at least 32 times, something was used in slow motion matrix. I felt like I was watching a snail kick ass. From the sweater button early in the movie to the bullets flying around the train, I was going to sucker punch someone in the face.On to the actresses. If I had a nickle for every time there was a close up shot of boobs jiggling, ass in fish nets, and high heels in this movie, I would be semi rich. The director, or producer obviously wanted extremely hot girls with a little bit of fighting style ( Mind you, those fighting skills came from NOWHERE) to attract horny men or occasionally women.Watching this, I thought to myself about how many horny teenagers, boys and girls enjoyed the skimpy dresses female actresses. I mean movies nowadays has the following, sex craved teens, 3d, sex, hot slow females, slow jocks, super heroes or just plain awful remakes.I said all I needed to say about this so called movie.",Null,0,3,3 September 2011
