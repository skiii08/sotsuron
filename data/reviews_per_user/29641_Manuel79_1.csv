Vertigo," A Masterpiece from a Mastermind.
","Every time I think in Vertigo (I watched it eight times) I think also in Psycho, both masterpieces from Alfred Hitchcock. And, as Psycho is an excellent movie (as 'The Shining' from Kubrick), Vertigo is unique, is more personal and almost unforgettable: has no comparison in Movies' world. It is more than a psychological thriller, a drama or a 'colorful film noir'. Superb dialogues, a beautiful shot of San Francisco, which seems to be intentionally strange -and not the well-known american city- and, of course, Vertigo give us the best James Stewart and Kim Novak performances. There is no much to say about the score: the opening credits are not as easy to listen as 'Psycho' or 'North by Northwest', and the fascinating 'scene d'Amore' (where Stewart finally changes Novak into another Novak) is just a variation of 'Tristan und Isolde' prelude (R. Wagner). 10/10.",10,8,11,21 April 2003
