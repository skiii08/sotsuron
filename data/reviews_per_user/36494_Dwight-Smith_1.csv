Alien 3," Great!The appropriate climax of this unbeatable Saga!!!
","I was shocked, when I saw the valuation of AlienÂ³ by the imdb-visitors. I cannot believe that this great movie was getting a lower quotation than Alien-Resurrection. I think the Saga found an excellent ending in this movie. The characters (especially the one of Ripley!)are getting even more dimensions, so it became the overwhelming climax, when Ripley ...,you'll see by yourself. Fincher also does a good filming job: The camera is dramatic, the tension is always on an high level an the atmosphere is unequalled! If you think, the Alien-Trilogy is just an exciting Sci-Fi-Horror and you are not interested in the backgrounds and details of the story, you MAYBE disappointed, but even this seems impossible to me, because of the story, atmosphere and actors. In my opinion this is the real end of Alien.Such a ridiculous Sequel like Alien-Resurrection can not succeed the first three movies (I cannot find the right words to explain it in english, but 'abgedrehte Scheisse' (this is german for ...well.. 'not too good') hits the point). I'm sorry for my bad english- I am working on it, but this movie is a great climax for the Alien-trilogy.",10,2,6,27 January 2001
