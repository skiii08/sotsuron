Casablanca," Best film of all time
","Most will admit that Casablanca is a great film, but many may find fault here or there in it.  But taken together as a whole, this is the best. The characters are great, even after many viewings, the acting is perfect, and barely a scene goes by without a classic line or moment.  If that isn't enough, just think about what it must have been like in 1942 watching this movie, before anyone knew how the war would really turn out.",10,1,2,16 May 2003
Chinatown," Quintessential Jack Nicholson
","This is Nicholson's best. You really feel that you are in the period and place. The mystery is top-notch, but nothing is left unexplained at the end. 'Do you know what we do with nosy people'--a classic. The others give great performance too-Huston and Dunaway.  Every time I see it, I find more that I like for it. 'bad for the glass'.",10,1,3,16 May 2003
21," Following the story in the book would have been better.
","OK, first what I liked about it. I like just about any movie about Vegas--and this one did a good job of bringing the flash to you--especially that first plane ride in at night--kind of makes you tingle. I liked must of the 'true' parts of the story--i.e., the true anecdotes lifted from the book, like the test at the local illegal blackjack room. The best friends (total fiction) were cute and made for some comic relief.This COULD have been a really good movie if it followed the true story closer though, rather than having the ridiculous premises that it did. Their was plenty of conflict for the protagonists in the book. Example: having the coed girlfriend at MIT at the same time he was dating an NBA cheerleader! (that was good stuff!) Plenty of contrast in the book too between MIT and Vegas.Oh well--not the worst movie, not a bad date movie, and some good scenes.",5,33,62,6 April 2008
Rear Window," One of the greatest films from the greatest director
",I was fortunate enough to see this in the theater when it was first re-released after the long hiatus in the early '80s.  The movie experience just doesn't get better than that. Hitchcock exploits the voyeur in all of us with this movie. We are with Jimmy Stewart all the way. And this has got to be Grace Kelly's best.,10,0,2,16 May 2003
