Skyfall," Bond is back ?
","I am big fan of 007 - Bond movies.My fav is Casino royal,when I heard the Quantum of solace is coming out I thought it must be good,but it turned out it was really bad ,so I had a lot of expectations about this one.Story is good,actors are good,but action ,well not so much.Everyone is expecting a lot of action in this one ,but I think this movie in compare to the others doesn't have any action.Main thing in it is the story about Bond,M and her son,action is in second plan.That doesn't have to be bad thing ,but in that case they should make story more interesting.At he end ,or about last 20 min are the highlight of the movie,till then you have feeling like you were watching something else,it just doesn't feel like you were watching a Bond movie.Well,for me this movie is disappointing,after waiting for it so long they could do so much more,with the story and the whole movie.",5,2,9,18 November 2012
Deadpool 2," Is this a joke , if it is then its a bad one.
","I am a bug fan of marvel comics and movies. When the first movie came out I could believe how good it was so good that I watched it 2 times in cinema and then bought blu Ray and watched it a couple of times since then, it always makes me laugh so hard.
I had some expectations for this one but didn't expect much since I didnt want to be disappointed but I could never imagine it being so bad.Story has improved since first movie but everything else went wrong. There is quite a few new characters but they all are just there without any characteristics they are just there On the other side everything is focused on deadpool even cable isn't developed as he should be. Jokes are flat, no one was laughing maybe just one or twice for a short period but thats it everything is forced. Cgi omg. ..There better and more realistic animations on ps3 games and even ps2 at some points. .",3,44,107,22 May 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Epic end
","When I first heard about twilight I thought it was nothing special and pretty much that it was bad.When I saw breaking dawn part 1 ,I was so stunned by it that next day I watched all other parts an bought books.Yeah I became another fan.After waiting ,the day has come,today I watched part 2 in cinema.It was everything I expected and even more.Story was great ,and from the beginning till end it was getting better and better.I am glad that in this part we learn a bit more about vampire family and their connections.But what everyone was waiting was the final battle.Of course it was epic ,but no one could imagine ,how it would end .It was probably one of the best ends in movies I have ever seen.Everyone should see this movie ,thrust me,it is really good.I have only one bad thing to say about it, it ended too soon, I would love to see story keep going.",Null,5,15,17 November 2012
