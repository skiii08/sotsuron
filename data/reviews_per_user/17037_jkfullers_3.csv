Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," My second favorite
","No devils, ghosts, or Davy Jones locker stuff to cheapen it. There are mermaids (which are awesome) and a better portion of the movie is somewhat realistic compared to the others. Sparrow isn't as funny... still is, but just not as. But that's okay because at least he's not drunk or completely useless like in one of the other movies. He has a role in the movie that MATTERS, and isn't just a stage prop. The story actually revolves around him (finally). Some may think it's a bad idea to make him star... but I think it's pretty fair. After all, for who else do we watch Pirates of the Caribbean?",7,2,2,11 September 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," It wasn't the worst
","Sure it was bad... Surprisingly still made me chuckle a few times at least. I could watch the whole thing through, unlike World's End which I basically skipped 80% of. But it was just super lame. Jack Sparrow was a complete dope, and the whole movie went by with hardly anything happening. On the cover Sparrow is holding a sword, but in the movie I don't recall him using it. I don't know... it just seemed like 2 hours of nothingness.",2,1,2,11 September 2018
Ice Age: Continental Drift," It RUINED our family movie night!
","So we made popcorn, huddled together cozily on the couch, and made the awful mistake of popping in this video! We only watched about 5 to 10 minutes of it before giving up and turning it off. Me and a few of my siblings went back to finish it another day, but were still disgusted.Right off the bat there's a bunch of pointless and insulting teenage drama, and insults to parents. Why did Manny and Ellie have to raise a brat? These are ANIMALS! They seem to act more like HUMANS in every film.In the first Ice Age the characters migrated, hunted, and you know, did animal things! Now in this movie you see pirates, ships, and mammoths flipping in the air like acrobats! It's very unbelievable.Scratt forming the continents of the world is VERY CHEAP! Scratt sinking underwater and turning into stringy monster is VERY CHEAP! Things like this aren't funny. This movie is fake compared to the original. It doesn't seem like the same world.I know character development is necessary for a good movie, but that doesn't mean changing their entire personalities! You can hardly recognize them. Where's the lovable Sid? Slink Diego? They no longer exist! Manny even lost his funny mammoth shuffle. Now he gallops around like a horse! Please don't waste your time like I did. It only takes one word to describe this movie 'dumb'.",2,1,2,16 August 2017
