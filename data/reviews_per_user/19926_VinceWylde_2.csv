The Legend of Bagger Vance," Another Unsung Classic
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is one of those films that didn't win much box office attention but definitely deserved more than it received. The film is brilliantly acted, and scored. The visual is brilliantly shot. Will Smith and Matt Damon have great on-screen chemistry. Every element a film needs to be a winner is here.The story takes place during the depression and paints the picture of once great golfer, Rannulph Junuh, who goes off to war and when he returns, loses his swing, and along with it, himself. Bagger Vance is the mysterious man who shows up as a kind of life guide. To say much more could spoil the plot.As a fan of America's Golden Era, I really enjoyed the movies underlying theme and nostalgic feel. Not only is it a well crafted story, but it's drafted on a canvas of magnificent sets with colorful people.Anyone that enjoys a good story will enjoy this film.",7,0,1,10 May 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," 'Potter' Movies Only Get Better
","Previous reviews of this film were heavy on criticism of certain themes being removed from the film. It is important to note that J.K. Rowling has a heavy say in what is put into the movie and what is removed. That being said, one can safely remove all disappointment as it was not a Hollywood decision.Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint all turn out incredible performances and show enormous growth in their acting skills. The special effects dance across the screen, and colors dazzle you.The relationships development in this film are one of the greatest attributes. Characters are clearly drawing lines in the sand and choosing sides as should be expected from implications in the previous movie. The overall plot really begins to heat up here and folks will not be disappointed.Of the 5 films, I mark this one as my favorite. The action heats up and the plot thickens. A great film.",8,0,0,18 August 2007
