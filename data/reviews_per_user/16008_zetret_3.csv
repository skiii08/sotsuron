"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A good symbolism runs throughout the movie.
",A good symbolism runs throughout the movie. Marathon metaphorically represents 'the run of your life'. WE can see a lot of David Schwimmer's acting and mannerism in Simon Pegg esp. in the initial scenes. It's pretty much the story of a man who runs.. away from everything in life A must watch if you are a David or Simon fan. David Schwimmer could have played the role of Simon's friend. This is a 'feel good' movie. We are expecting a lot more from David Schwimmer in the future. The feel good factor is present in friends too and the sequence of Simon running away from his pregnant 'about to be' wife is enjoyable. The movie isn't all about 'logic' and stuff. It is illogical but still who cares?,10,0,2,20 February 2009
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris - brilliance in movie making
","Well, Woody Allen finally found a Bogart in him . :) It's been a while since I posted something for having not found a worthy work of art and also because of my belief that worthiness is subjective and immeasurable. Midnight is Paris is not just a movie, it is a dream. As a movie, it exceeds expectations and as a dream, it (contrastingly) looks real. In 1979, Woody Allen wrote 'The Kugelmass episodes' in the New Yorker, wherein the protagonist escapes into the past, whilst striving to attain sanity in the present. Although similar in thought, Midnight in Paris is much more than just a fantasy. It is brilliance in movie making. At this point in time, one can most assuredly say that Woody Allen has matched the likes of Fellini and shifted the epicenter of perfectionism towards the West. I shall not attempt to tell the story, but articulate myself on the subject given the fact that no one is ever going to read this.The movie is about the protagonist's journey into his fantasy, thus paving the way for realizing a sane, fulfilling life in his present.Owen Wilson is a complete surprise. One can see a young, vibrant Woody Allen in him. Even his style of delivery has been matched to that of Allen. The character is absolutely fantastic. Having to express notions like cognitive dissonance, disbelief, paranoia and a need to escape the realms of the present, Owen Wilson delivers. He is believable and aptly cast. Marion Cotillard, as always, is perfect as Adriana, Picasso's lover, who has married the likes of Braque and Modigliani, and may (or may not) fall in love with Owen Wilson's character, Gil.As his character grows and escapes into the delusions of fantasy, suspension of disbelief kicks in. This is probably one of the greatest examples of how 'suspension of disbelief' can effectively be used to convey ideas that are simple (contrast to complex notions like Science fiction), in scenarios that are amusing and far-fletched. The only concern about the movie is Kathy Bates playing the role of Gertrude Stein. That, to me was the moment I suspended believing in disbelief. Probably because of her huge body of work, but it is arguable that she was miscast.If you aren't aware of the Fitzgeralds, Alice B. Toklas, Ernest Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, Dali, Cole Porter, the movie is still amusing and inspiring in a way. Some of the dialogues are absolutely brilliant. It is irresistible to quote some lines from the movie.Ernest Hemingway: All men fear death. It's a natural fear that consumes us all. We fear death because we feel that we haven't loved well enough or loved at all, which ultimately are one and the same. However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears. Because when you are sharing your body and heart with a great woman the world fades away. You two are the only ones in the entire universe. You conquer what most lesser men have never conquered before, you have conquered a great woman's heart, the most vulnerable thing she can offer to another. Death no longer lingers in the mind. Fear no longer clouds your heart. Only passion for living, and for loving, become your sole reality. This is no easy task for it takes insurmountable courage. But remember this, for that moment when you are making love with a woman of true greatness you will feel immortal. (Courtesy of IMDb) Ernest Hemingway: No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.(Courtesy of IMDb) And the most brilliant of them all, reserved for Gertrude Stein from Allen, We all fear death and question our place in the Universe. The artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to provide an antidote for the emptiness of existence. (I typed it) Woody Allen is probably the best American writer in the past decade. He has elevated, once again, the benchmark of perfection. The writing is simple, unlike his other works which makes it more compelling to watch. The subtle humor that comes along with every single character, the typical Allen mannerisms and above it all, Paris, makes it a movie-goer's dream- a great one at that.Rating : 9.5 on 10 .This review has not been corrected for grammatical errors or popular opinion.Visit http://upenreviews.blogspot.com/2011/08/midnight-in-paris-review.html for more.",10,2,6,7 August 2011
Up in the Air," jason reitman=awesome
","UP IN THE AIR Jason Reitman , the director of Juno and Thank You for Smoking is back, with a bang. Up in the Air is definitely one of the best movies of the year. In a line, the movie talks about the protagonists' emotional transformation in our 'disconnected' society.George Clooney, in one word is spectacular. He plays the role of Ryan Bingham, who fires people for a living. He is also a motivational speaker, who talks people out of relationships, who doesn't buy the whole idea of relationships and marriages. He travels 322 days a year and his life is basically, 'Up in the air'. Vera Flaminga is his soul-mate , who happens to meet him , given the two being frequent flyers. She does a brilliant job. The movie is about, what happens to their lives. Might sound simple, but trust me, it is so unpredictable. After he meets his soul-mate he wonders if it's time to give up what he believes. Right when everything is perfect and he is ready to make the connection, he discovers that it is not to be. In the end, he is overcome with disappointment, which leaves the viewer startled.Also noteworthy is Anna Kendrick's role as Natalie Keener.The screenplay is so brilliant, it just takes your breath away. Importantly, it is funny and takes an ambiguous view of Ryan Bingham's feelings and emotions. I was told the movie is based on a novel by Walter Kirn. The movie scores in all the departments. With flawless screenplay, acting, direction, cinematography, the movie is definitely up and running for the Oscars. One of George Clooney's and Jason Reitman's finest.My Rating:4.5 on 5 . A definite watch.",9,0,2,5 March 2010
