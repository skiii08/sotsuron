The Avengers," So Much COULD Have Gone Wrong, but Thankfully, it Didn't
","As the title to this review says, 'So Much COULD Have Gone Wrong' however, nothing did, in fact, it was the best movie of 2012 (until the Dark Knight Rises came out, but that's a whole 'nother story). Although the plot was a downfall, the action and the perfect screen-time for each of the heroes redeemed it. Also, the camera angles are so unique that you just have to appreciate the movie more. If you liked Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, or The Incredible Hulk, you will LOVE this movie. Also, they change Hulk for the better, so now he becomes the Hulk when he gets mad (not when his heart rate goes up) and he was more there for comedy. However, the climax and the way they solved the problem was bad, just having Iron Man fly up into the oblivion of space. Well, actually, that part was okay, but when he came back down to Earth he was unconscious, so Hulk stomped and roared to wake him up. Although it was funny, not exactly the way I would like Iron Man to be revived.This brings me to another point, this movie was very funny. I'm not saying that it was funny for children, no, it was funny for all ages, with Hulk's anger getting in the way with some people (i.e., Thor) and just some jokes that were sprinkled into the conversations throughout the movie.Overall, this movie is great. It is action-packed, fun for kids (and pretty much any other family member), and it is (for a change) funny! Although the plot and the climax is a potential downfall, that should not stop you from seeing this movie.",8,1,4,10 May 2013
The Dark Knight," Who would've thought a Batman movie could be so...Perfect?
","The Dark Knight is a revelation in film making-both comic book and regular. Usually I give comic book movies slack, since the actors aren't meant to be brilliant, he plot is not meant to be mind-bending and meaningful, and the theme is supposed to be something along the lines of, 'Heroes will always be there to save the day!'. However, if I give Christopher Nolan's masterpiece 'The Dark Knight' slack, I would be driving myself insane to put an infinity out of ten for the rating. The Dark Knight needs no slack put on it, it is a GREAT film. Starting off with the acting (I'll end with The Joker), Alfred (Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) pull off the (second) best part of the film, the acting is...Beautiful. Yes, these actors are beyond good, however, the 'main attraction' is Heath Ledger's version of The Joker. You feel as if Ledger is actually as insane as The Joker and his acting is beyond brilliant and beautiful to the thousandth power (RIP).However, that is only the acting, the plot is GREAT and the theme is something we should all remember. I won't spoil anything, though, you deserve to watch this movie for yourself.Or, better yet, IT deserves for you to watch it.OVERALL: The Dark Knight is quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen, the acting, plot, theme, directing-I could go on-is just magnificent. If you haven't seen it simply because it's a 'Batman movie' you are truly missing out. Nolan's work of art is so brilliant and good that The Dark Knight isn't even a Batman movie anymore. If you haven't seen it, you are truly missing out on something extraordinary.",10,0,1,30 June 2013
