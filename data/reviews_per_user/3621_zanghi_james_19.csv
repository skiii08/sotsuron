Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's taken about nineteen years, but I really enjoy this film now
","I'd say this film was one of my least favorite sci-fi films when I watched it originally on VHS (Yes, I'm that old to know what the heck a VHS is without watching Stranger Things). However, after watching Episodes II and III as well as most of the first season of The Clone Wars and reading some of the Expanded Universe books, it grew on me. I just recently watched it as of writing this review, and I found it surprisingly enjoyable, much more so than the rather poor and un-rewatchable productions of recent years produced by Disney and Lucasfilm.Now, this film is not perfect, and not just because of the character of Jar-Jar Binks. Jake Lloyd's Anakin was a bit wooden as was Ewan as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Natalie Portman could have thrown a bit more emotion in certain scenes of playing Padme. The better performances go to Liam Neeson and, of course, Ian McDiarmid. John Williams' score is really memorable, especially with the iconic piece 'Duel of the Fates', which is practically the theme song of the Prequel Trilogy. There's some great fight scenes and the climatic battle sequence is well-edited and shot.The expanded universe novelization by Terry Brooks also helps flesh out this story. I recommend reading it before watching this film, as it lends depth to a lot of scenes.",9,1,3,12 July 2019
The Death of Stalin," Dark Gallows Humor Film with Great acting performances
","I don't know much about Russia's history, especially in regards to the rise of Communism. And like many people, I was skeptical about the idea of making a comedy set during Stalin's regime. Even with a cool all-star cast of great actors including Monty Python's Michael Palin, I was skeptical.Well, I love it when I'm wrong!This is a really hilarious film, if you like extremely dark comedy that is quite morbid. I also thought the idea of all the actors not using Russian accents or speaking Russian is interesting. I highly enjoyed this film and Jason Isaacs is priceless as a strange general.",9,0,0,26 January 2020
X-Men," One of the most important Modern Superhero movies out there, but has sadly not held up well in a few aspects
","I loved the X-Men franchise films, even with its super-screwed-up timelines. It's almost 2020, now, and I'd say that it's still a good series, but recently I re-watched the original X-Men by Bryan Singer, and I can see some impressive flaws in it.First off, the action for the movie is incredibly slow in comparison to standard MCU/DCEU-fare. The fight scenes are forgettable and poorly choreographed, even worse than the Lau fight scene of The Dark Knight. There's no real build-up or intensity. Plus, all Cyclops does in this story is press a button. He doesn't throw a punch.Second, the acting. While there is no doubt that the casting of most of the actors is great (Namely Ian McKellen as Magneto, Bruce Davidson as Robert Kelly, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Ray Park as Toad, and Patrick Stewart as Xavier) some of the other actors give poor performances that don't live up to their comic-book counterparts. James Marsden is instantly forgettable as Scott Summers, Famke Jammsen is rather weak as Jean, and Halle Berry is incredibly one-dimensional as Storm.Despite the flaws, this film is notable since it is pretty much one of the first Modern Superhero movies that focused primarily on dramatic storytelling and gritty action. There are some well-done scenes that make up for the poor script and bad fights, most notably the iconic performance of Hugh Jackman on the train with Anna Paquin as Rogue. That scene gets me every time in a good way. Also, the ending scene is perfection with Charles and Erik playing chess and discussing the fate of the Academy if the Mutant Registration law is ever passed.I like also how this movie compares the Mutant Community of Marvel Comics in a parallel to what is going on with the LBGTQ community these days. I think it's a good parallel.May the Force be with you!",7,0,1,21 October 2019
Suicide Squad," 2016 was not the best year for DC in Theaters
","Everyone thought 2016 was going to be a good year for DC with two big-budget action films going into theaters that would include so many characters fans had been wanting to see either finally on the silver screen or in more better forms. Instead, both films were incredibly divisive and needed extended cuts to help make them a little better.Suicide Squad (2016) is set after Dawn of Justice, and it assumes you know what happened in that movie. If not, it reminds you with one of the opening sequences. Apparently, after what happened in Dawn of Justice, other superbeings have begun to appear...and quickly get arrested by Amanda Waller, who is intent on using them like slave soldiers for protecting America. But like all the best laid plans, Amanda Waller's attempt to control beings beyond her control backfires, and her team is forced to clean up her mess before the Apocalypse is started.Let's talk about the good stuff in this film.Acting first. Viola Davis embodies Waller quite well as a total sociopath. I haven't seen how her character is like in the Arrowverse yet, but I'm getting there, BTW. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Harley Quinn, while Jared Leto was a great casting choice as the Joker. Will Smith's performance evokes memories of his early action films, mainly Bad Boys and Independence Day. I also liked the actors who played Katana, Killer Croc, and Captain Boomerang.The soundtrack is great, too. I am totally clueless about Rap/Hip-Hop, but there's some a lot of good pieces used in the film. Plus, using Rick James' 'Super Freak' was a great choice for Harley Quinn's introduction song.The Action Scenes are great, as well. I think it's they were very fluid and were enjoyable, but not incredibly memorable. In comparison to the fight and action scenes of the Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen, and the first two official DC Extended Universe films, there's nothing really impressive, especially in comparison to the final fight between Superman and Zod.Also, I liked how they brought some backstory and motivation to the main villain (Enchantress). Nothing fancy, but it felt like more than what Marvel would normally do for their villains in Phase One and Two of their cinematic universe.Visually, the looks of the characters is cool. It's more realistic than the designs of the previous DC heroes, and evokes images of the Dark Knight trilogy and the first two Arrow seasons. There's no supersuits and incredibly elaborate costumes, which is appropriate, since the characters are definitely not superheroes. The only design I didn't like was the look of Enchantress, which is supposed to be like a parallel to Galadriel's dark form from Peter Jackson's movies about Middle-Earth, as she looks very different in the comics I have read about her.Now what I didn't like about the film.I didn't like that, for most of the first two acts of the movie, the characters were so detestable. It definitely rubs in your face that the characters are bad guys and they have some pretty bad traits. Then, at the third act, they unite and fight the Enchantress and the Incubus. I'm all for suspending belief, but even I was having trouble with why these guys would want to save the world.Also, I would have loved a lot more of Jared Leto's footage as the Joker. He seems like he is the best choice for the role and he really enjoys playing him. I sincerely hope he makes a cameo or something even bigger in the upcoming Birds of Prey movie in 2020 as well as The Suicide Squad in 2021. I'd say he's better than Nicholson's Joker and way more enjoyable than Ledger's Joker (Haven't seen Joaquin Phoenix's film yet, but that's not even in the official cinematic universe, so not a lot of motivation there. Besides, reportedly he's not even the real Joker in that one, anyway, so why bother?).My final opinion is that this is an okay film. If you feel like watching it, go for the Extended Cut. It's not the best DC Film, but it's not the worst. Besides, DC made up for it with Wonder Woman in 2017 and Aquaman in 2018 (No, I haven't seen Shazam, yet, but I really want to). I think David Ayer was not the best choice for directing this film, but I think James Gunn's upcoming Suicide Squad film will be much better, even if it is supposed to be a reboot and a remake at the same time yet still move the story forward...whatever that means. Hey, it's better than the theatrical cut of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, anyway.",7,0,1,7 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," *Sigh* Well, I'm done watching Star Wars. Seriously.
","Much like The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, this film would have worked more as a speculative fiction or if it just wasn't a Star Wars film. They would have been great science-fiction/fantasy films if it wasn't for the fact that they are officially part of the Star Wars universe. However, The Sequel Trilogy is Star Wars and it is terrible.Much like Timothy Zahn said when he wrote the Thrawn Trilogy (a great book trilogy that sadly is now confined to the Legends universe), bringing Palpatine makes everything that everyone fought for in the Clone Wars and the Rebellion pointless. Plus, with no inclusion of Baby Yoda, Ahsoka Tano, Darth Maul, Ezra Bridger, or other related characters, it's safe to assume that the First Order killed them. It really wrecks the rest of the early Star Wars productions since you realize it is all in vain and pointless.Much of the plot makes little to no sense, especially the twists. It really feels like that they were writing this script while filming at the same time because they throw in characters and twists for no apparent reason. Characters like Zorii Bliss and Jannah have little to no purpose to the plot, while the big twist that Hux (of all people) is a spy for the Resistance is just a cheap plot device that serves no purpose, really. Also, the new Force Powers make little no sense, mainly the strange ability that Rey and Ren have to use their Force Connection from The Last Jedi to exchange physical items over great distances. That makes for a great magic trick and a convenient plot device, but it's a little too reminiscent of a Marvel film.And speaking of Marvel, that really is the big problem of this entire redoing of Star Wars: That they are trying to imitate Marvel's immense success. Instead of using established original canon stories or even just George Lucas' original storyline, they brought in a different director for each film and have him do whatever he wants and then have the next director build off of what they did. It works for Marvel's Cinematic Universe, but it really doesn't for the Star Wars saga.This film has a couple of good points. The action scenes are nicely choreographed, the main characters are a little more interesting, and the camerawork in combination with the special effects is on the same level as films by more competent directors like Zack Snyder and Peter Jackson.As I said before with The Last Jedi, John Williams' score is literally cookie-cutter and nothing memorable aside from reusing a couple of pieces from the Original Trilogy. There is no use of 'Battle of the Heroes', 'Across the Stars', or 'Duel of the Fates' from the Prequels at all, which is truly sad since I think those are some of John Williams' best pieces for Star Wars along with a few others. But seriously, they could have at least brought in Kevin Kiner from the Animated shows.The final battle is okay, but how Palpatine finally dies is very anti-climatic. Not to mention it's basically a rip-off of Avengers: Endgame's climatic fight, most notably with the dialogue. Seriously, when Rey blasted Palpatine while saying her quote, I briefly thought she would say 'And I am...Iron Man!' instead of 'I am all the Jedi.'I wasn't too surprised that Kylo Ren/Ben Solo redeemed himself also, though he certainly didn't deserve it after everything his character did. He really is a poor overly-emotional imitation of Anakin.So, in short, Episode IX is pretty bad if you grew up a diehard Star Wars fan like me. It's worse, for me, since I really now have no motivation to work on a Star Wars Legends screenplay project of my own or really to keep watching this franchise. I might still read the Legends Books and Graphic Novels, but I have really not interested in The Clone Wars or Rebels anymore (which is sad, because I heard both of them had great finales in comparison of this finale). I really hope that the rumors that the franchise is taking a break for restructuring itself after this debacle are true, but I doubt it since they are still pushing more pointless spin-off shows for Disney Plus about Cassian Andor before Rogue One or Obi-Wan in his exile (yeah, that sounds truly exciting! Not!). I'm far more interested in the upcoming Dune film by Denis Villeneuve than anything new from LucasFilm LTD. I think I really am tired of Star Wars and I just don't want anything to do with them until they get their act together.Now, I know normally I say 'May the Force be with You' for an ending comment, but I guess that's done now so instead I say this: Farewell.",1,8,11,19 May 2020
Man of Steel," While it lacks the fun and magic of Christopher Reeve's Superman, Man of Steel is an excellent Superhero Film
","Man of Steel is an interesting and refreshing take on the Superman mythos, and appropriately, it is the first film of the DC Extended Cinematic Universe. It might not be as fun as Christopher Reeve or George Reeves' takes on Superman, and it certainly is one of the darker Superhero films, but there are a lot of great scenes and iconic shots, which is sort of a trademark for Zack Snyder with his superhero films.Also, I love Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL's score. It would be hard to imagine the light and heroic feel of the John Williams' 'Superman' Theme from Christopher Reeve's films playing in a lot of scenes like the Smallville Skirmish or the Battle of Metropolis, and especially Zod and Superman's violent fight at the end.The movie does have a slow start, even with the opening sequence on Krypton and the Oil Rig sequence, but once the action truly starts, it doesn't let up at all. I had the good fortune to see this in the theaters with my dad, and the Theater's surround sound certainly helped the soundtrack and the sound effects of the explosions.There are some points I wasn't impressed with. Mainly, there was the similarity in style to Christopher Nolan's style of filming and editing, but also I found the cinematography effects a little weird. There was a bit of lens flare which made me think I was watching a J.J. Abrams Star Trek film occasionally, and also at some points in the action scenes, the camera zooms in to certain points of action with extreme abruptness. Also, portraying Superman more darker and broody like Batman was in the Dark Knight Trilogy is borderline sacrilege.Despite these minor and major problems with the story and cinematography and editing, I really enjoyed this film. I hope Henry Cavill reprises his performance as Superman in another film, preferably as a more nicer Superman, because he is almost as good as Christopher Reeve.",8,2,2,9 January 2020
The Shining," Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is aptly named, because this is more Kubrick's style than King's
","Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is often considered to be one of the greatest horror movies in the history of cinema, perhaps even THE greatest. As a considerable fan of Stephen King since my teenaged years, I wanted to get a copy of this film to watch, but I wanted to read the book first, much like I did with another of his horror books: IT. Sadly, I've yet to finish reading Stephen King's The Shining, but I have read perhaps enough to know it is superior to Kubrick's cinematic interpretation.Now, I have seen two other films by Kubrick, which are appropriately some of his most critically acclaimed and well-known: 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. Both of which were well-filmed and ground-breaking at the time, much like the Shining was at the time. I liked them both, though I found Clockwork Orange much easier to enjoy and understand than 2001, for some odd reason.The Shining adaptation by Kubrick, though, is a lot like, well, a badly-done piece of toast that has been burnt too much. I like it when a director deviates from the original text here and there, but I would prefer from them to keep the original story alive. Kubrick keeps the bare-bones of the story alive, but rewrites most of the story for apparently no reason. Since Kubrick is dead and has not left any information or interviews about why he changed key parts of the story, I will just have to make my peace with not knowing, but it slightly changes my opinion of the great Stanley Kubrick.That isn't to say this isn't a well-done film. The camerawork is top-knotch and the strange music-score is a perfect addition. There are some really freaky scenes when the horror starts up, most enhanced well by Jack Nicholson's terrifying performance. Most notable scenes that surprised me were the infamous Room 237 scene with the Bathtub Lady; the scene where Wendy finds out that 'All work and no play makes Jack a Dull boy'; and the death of Dick Halloran at the hands of Jack Torrance. Shelly Duvall has a couple of good scenes, but I would say that she is probably the most useless character in the movie. However, I really thought her scenes of terror in the Hotel were well-shot and spooky, especially with the weird chanting. Danny Lloyd, though, is iconic as Danny Torrance, playing a typical Stephen King kid with a lot of excellent performances...and quite frankly, some bravery in a few scenes. Scatman Crothers is a cool paternal figure, as well.I can see where a lot of horror films, particularly recent masterpieces by Robert Eggers and Ari Aster have received influence from this film, at least in terms of atmosphere and music and terror. The climax of the film is well-done and spooky as hell, but it's considerably different than the book. All the problems of the Shining forced Mike Flanagan, who had taken on the monumental task of directing the sequel book, Doctor Sleep, to adapt the novel differently and make it more of a reconciliation, reportedly, to Kubrick's film.One of the biggest peeves of mine about this film, too, is that ending sequence. I don't understand it, and like I said, since Kubrick is dead and has offered no explanation, we'll probably never understand it. Nevertheless, it's a good staple of horror, if you don't mind it being so different than the book.May the Force be with You!",8,1,1,29 March 2020
Alien vs. Predator," Decent Creature Feature involving the Two most beloved monsters from Space
","I'm a bit of an Alien fan. I really enjoyed Ridley Scott's original film and his two official prequels (Prometheus and Covenant). While I haven't had a chance to watch or finish watching the other Alien films or Predator films, I think they are good films to watch if you enjoy really good horror and action.I also figured, at the time, that an Alien vs. Predator movie wouldn't have done well. Also, factor in the fact that these films are no longer considered canon and I wasn't too interested in watching it.Nevertheless, I decided to watch it anyway and I enjoyed it. It's nowhere near as iconic as Ridley Scott's original nightmare in space, and fans of Prometheus will notice a lot of similarities. I thought it wasn't a half bad film. It was mostly a rehash of Resident Evil (which was ironically appropriate, since both AVP and the original Resident Evil are directed by Paul W.S. Anderson) with the Pyramid being similar to the Hive installation from Resident Evil.Also, I recommend you watch the Unrated version, as it is a little more complete than the theatrical cut. Plus, more gore since it isn't PG-13.",7,2,2,20 February 2020
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Definitely one of the best prequels ever made as well as a cinematic adaptation of a novel
","(This is a review of the Extended Edition of the movie)I grew up as a kid reading J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit, watching the animated films on Videotape, and going to the theaters to watch the Peter Jackson live-action trilogy. Naturally, Peter Jackson's trilogy adaptation of Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite film series to watch and I had no doubt he would do an adaptation of The Hobbit sooner or later. There was a bit of a wait for The Hobbit Trilogy, but it was worth it. I saw all three in theaters and loved them, and much like Lord of the Rings, I made sure to get the Extended Edition of each film.This film is a worthy prequel to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Since it had the same director, writers and all the other crew members, I was pretty sure it would do well. Plus, one of my favorite fantasy directors helped write the script: Guillermo del Toro. How cool was that?For those who have not read the original books by Tolkein or haven't seen any of the previous films (animated or live-action), the narrative is pretty easy to follow and doesn't rely on The Lord of the Rings trilogy too much. There are references to the Lord of the Rings, though, abounding in this film alone. If you have watched the Hobbit trilogy first before watching LOTR, you may have to go back and re-watch the Hobbit again, as there are plenty of great references and Easter Eggs to find.The acting and casting, as usual, is brilliant. Martin Freeman is perfectly cast as a young Bilbo Baggins. I had only seen him, I believe, in Hitchhiker's Guide (another great adaptation of a great novel) and maybe one season of Sherlock before watching him nail it as Bilbo. Bilbo's story-arc in this movie is an excellent example of a reluctant hero going from a regular average person to a brave and courageous individual.The returning characters from the LOTR trilogy are numerous. The best is, of course, Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey Wizard. Despite his famous claim in Fellowship as being 'barely involved in the business with the Dragon', Gandalf is much more of a center-stage character in this story. Christopher Lee brings his usual gravitas and darkness to Saruman the White, while Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving reprise their iconic roles of Galadriel and Elrond with a few surprises to their characters' (especially Galadriel!) story-arcs that help flesh them out. Also, Elijah Wood makes a nice cameo at the beginning, returning as Frodo (I had been wondering what he had been up to after LOTR and Sin City).For new characters, this film is amazing. A big surprise to me (and most Tolkein fans, I have noticed) is the inclusion of Radagast the Brown Wizard. He is played superbly, lovably, and hilariously by Sylvester McCoy. His character is both a wacky crazy man and at times has a few great serious scenes, especially with his Rhosgobel Rabbits outrunning a bunch of Gundabad Wargs!But the truly best new characters are the Company of Thorin a.k.a. the Dwarves. I love how diverse they are in comparison to the Dwarves from the Animated Movie.Richard Armitage does a wonderful job as Thorin Oakenshield, playing him as a tough-as-nails warrior but who is also compassionate and loyal to his people. Ian Stott is my personal favorite as Balin, with Graham McTavish coming in second as his bada$$ older brother Dwalin (who looks like a character who could tear Khal Drogo and the Night King apart with his bare hands...okay, maybe at least Khal Drogo and Euron Greyjoy.). Bofur is my third favorite, followed by Kili, Bombur, and Oin.The villains are awesome, also. I love the new look of the Orcs, especially Azog (played by Manu Bennett, aka Slade from Arrow!). I also think the subtle reveals of Smaug and 'the Necromancer' in the film are nice touches.Howard Shore's score is, as usual, perfection. I love his use of choruses and also using songs from the book. If you get the Extended Edition, you'll more than likely love the 'Goblin-Town' song.All-in-all, it's a great film",9,0,1,4 September 2019
1941," It's not a great WWII film, but it's a pretty good comedy!
","Just had the pleasure of watching this film with my dad, who said he hadn't watched this film in well over twenty years, and we both highly enjoyed it! If I had not researched it beforehand and I didn't know who the director was, you would be very hard-pressed to convince me this wasn't a film by John Landis instead by Steven Spielberg.There's some great humor in this film that doesn't pull any punches. It felt like I was watching a WWII film meets The Blues Brothers, Animal House, and It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The acting is surprisingly good, though John Belushi and Dan Akroyd are slightly underused. The young love story is a little over-the-top, but it just adds to 1941's looney-tune comedic value.However, I did find some of the racial comments a tad bit insensitive, and not just towards the Japanese and German people. If you can handle the frequent negative racial commentary, though, this film is quite good. I recommend it.",8,0,3,26 October 2019
Patton," Okay War Movie with the Wrong Message
",This movie glorifies war. But it also sends the wrong message about General Patton. He was reportedly an notorious anti-Semite and opposed fighting Nazi Germany in favor of wiping out Soviet Russia and Imperial Japan. I hope to never watch this film again.,2,0,1,26 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," If it wasn't a Star Wars film, this could have been a great Sci-Fi Film
","Everything that the critics, fan and alike, have said about this film is absolutely true. There's some great iconic shots, but the film is all style, no substance.Much like The Force Awakens, the heroes of the story are broken into shards and the pieces are impossible to pick up. Kylo and Snoke are just poor impostors of Vader and Palpatine. But the cruelest cut is Luke Skywalker. Even with the scene at the end, one of my childhood heroes has become nothing but a coward. Carrie Fisher is okay as Leia, though.The new good-guy characters are okay. Rey has a good story-arc, and I like the whole Finn and Rose story, while Poe is an interesting character. It doesn't make up for Luke's character in the story, though.John Williams' score is nothing spectacular. Mostly just cookie-cutter stuff from the other Star Wars films and typical stuff from average superhero films. For a film with such a big budget, this film could have splurged for a Zimmer protégé, at least.If it wasn't a Star Wars film, it could have been a great film, but it is a Star Wars film...and it is not a great film. Rian Johnson said this film honors the original trilogy by subverting it....which makes no sense. It actually is the opposite. He dishonors every single thing Star Wars stands for with this film.Even with the upcoming Episode IX this year looking alright, this film is not the greatest Star Wars film ever. I'm glad that Disney is considering taking a break from making Star Wars films, because they have screwed it all up by discarding established Expanded Universe canon like the Thrawn Trilogy, Young Jedi Knights, The New Jedi Order, Legacy of the Force, and Fate of the Jedi. There's no point in watching The Mandalorian, since it's just a tie-in to the Sequel Trilogy, really, or the supposed Obi-Wan show. I'd rather Disney finish this Sequel trilogy then start adapting the Expanded Universe books as movies next. If they adapted the Thrawn Trilogy alone as a separate universe series, it'd be a lot better than this kind of film.May the Force be with You.",1,5,8,27 October 2019
Midsommar," This is one of the better horror films I have ever seen.
","A lot of horror movies try to freak you out. A lot of horror movies try to disturb you. But not many horror movies try to blow your mind and are so beautiful. Midsommar by Ari Aster is definitely the mind-blowing and beautiful category, which is incredibly rare.Midsommar is arthouse horror. Much like Eli Roth's Hostel duology, it's has some heavy stuff about culture clash. However, it is much less gross and sadistic.The soundtrack is ethereal, especially when they arrive in the commune.The characters are a bit interesting. Florence Pugh should get an award for her performance and the European cast are all great. Will Poulter's character I just was repulsed by as he was so disrespectful towards another culture and society. The other two guys are okay (Jack Reynor and William Jackson Harper) and I wish there was more development between the two of them.The cinematography is great, almost Kubrickian in appearance. I really thought it was impressive that the film is shot like it's almost taking place over the course of one day and you never see the sun. It adds to the feel of disorientation and underlying darkness of the film.Now, the pacing for the film is quite slow and the horrors are subtle. The climax is disturbing and chilling and worth the wait. However, the wait is not for everyone, as there are some really slow scenes. Also, if you got the Director's cut on iTunes, be prepared for more longer and slower scenes.Pros:
<ul><li>Gorgeous camera work and set design</li><li>Great acting</li><li>Ethereal Music</li><li>Good disturbing scenes of horror</li></ul>Cons:
<ul><li>Incredibly slow pace</li><li>Will Poulter's character is a butthead</li><li>Director's Cut has no subtitles and the dialogue is a little hard to follow without them</li></ul>Also, fans of Robin Hardy's legendary film about sacrifice and cults 'The Wicker Man' will probably complain about this film being an arthouse copy of it.",9,7,15,16 January 2020
Reservoir Dogs," The First Film
","Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite guilty pleasure directors. I'm not a huge fan of ultra-violent films with blood, guts, and torture, but it's just the way that Tarantino does it in his movies makes it enjoyable.I love how the film starts, too. A bunch of tough guys sitting around a breakfast table enjoying diner food, shooting the breeze about various stuff while smoking some cigarettes and getting almost philosophical about Madonna and whether or not tipping is a smart thing to do. Plus, there's the cool title sequence set to a band that I had never heard before playing a song that just fits the scene.Reservoir Dogs is shot very well and still holds up nicely on a good HD screen. The camera work is clever, and usually quite steady. There are some really iconic shots all over the place, especially given the fact that the majority of the film takes place in essentially a warehouse, an office, and a bathroom. I also notice that the film has a good soundtrack, like pretty much any of Tarantino's films. Tarantino's use of music like 'Stuck in the Middle with you' and 'Little Green Bag' in the scenes they are featured in is wonderful and, well, iconic. I can't think of 'Stuck in the Middle with You' without thinking of Michael Madsen dancing around with a straight razor and looking smooth and crazy.The violence in this film is a major driving point also. The primary event of violence the film focuses on is obviously the botched diamond robbery. What's genius about it is that Tarantino doesn't ever show the robbery at all. All you know is that Mister Blonde went nuts and shot a lot of people. With just a few choice sentences, though, and a little overactive imagination, you can imagine a whole bloodbath. Much of the raw violence of the film takes place, if I am correct, in the last half-hour with the flashbacks involving how Mister Orange gets shot and, of course, the Mexican standoff between three of the characters at the end that looks right out of Sergio Leone's films. It's sort of like Jordan Peele's 'Get Out', a slow build-up to a violent climax. However, there is one scene that still is hard to watch in terms of violence and that is the scene with Michael Madsen torturing the uniformed cop. It's harder to watch for me, since I respect the cops a lot.Acting-wise, this film is pretty cool. Of course, you can see the usual Tarantino regulars like Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth (and personally, I wouldn't have been surprised if the role of the black cop would have gone to Samuel L. Jackson if this film had been made today), but also a few actors I had never seen in a Tarantino film. Steve Buscemi is okay, but doesn't do too much in the film. Keitel and Roth have great camaraderie as a sort of master-apprentice style relationship and personally, I would have loved to learn more about Keitel's character than just that one flashback, since he seems like a just interesting character. Tim Roth, who I know of from watching Pulp Fiction and Marvel's The Incredible Hulk, is pretty young and slick. I should probably look into a few more of his films, since I find his performance in Reservoir Dogs not too shabby. Chris Penn plays a good gangster who kind of reminds me of a smarter Santino Corleone with a much cooler temper, too. Same with Laurence Tierney. On the other hand, Michael Madsen, whoa. This guy plays a real nasty psychopath and does it with gusto. If they had actually filmed the Robbery sequence, I think he would give me nightmares with his thirst for blood. The torture sequence he partakes in is, as previously mentioned, really simplistic yet at the same time, messed up. Eddie Bunker and the man himself, Quentin Tarantino, are, like Buscemi, woefully underused also as they play a couple of interesting characters who, like Keitel's Mister White, are characters I want to learn more about.Like I said, this film is a good film. I don't know if it is Tarantino's best, since I've still got a few of his to watch and since each film builds off each other, it's hard to label it. Nevertheless, a good film to watch if you got some free time and want to start watching Tarantino's style of cinema.",9,0,0,27 May 2019
Pulp Fiction," A Perfect follow-up to Reservoir Dogs!
","Quentin Tarantino made a nice splash with his cinematic debut of directing Reservoir Dogs. And less than five years later, he followed up with another wonderful non-linear masterpiece that not only lived up to the previous films performance, but outshined it as well, appropriately called Pulp Fiction.Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction is not for everyone. There is an incredible amount of cussing and swearing as well as violence and disturbing imagery. There are some callbacks to the style of Reservoir Dogs as well with the violence, like not showing the violent boxing match that is the main point of Bruce Willis' character's story in the film is definitely a callback to Tarantino not showing the botched diamond robbery in Reservoir Dogs. Some of the scenes of violence are so out there, though, that they are almost like R-Rated scenes from a Three Stooges short, most notably the scene where Uma Thurman needs to be revived from overdosing on Heroin. However, don't expect such comedical style all the time, since there is that one scene with Bruce and Ving that is like Deliverance was directed by Eli Roth.As usual, the casting choices of the film are spot-on. Ving Rhames, who I really only have seen else in the Mission Impossible films, plays a great, tough, and much more likable gangster than Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs. John Travolta's character, despite doing a great dance scene, plays a pretty despicable bonehead who gets his comeuppance in a nice satisfying way of gallows humor. The true star is Samuel L. Jackson, playing a good-natured and loyal gangster who, following a slightly botched job, gets a better view of his violent life and decides to get his act together. The cameos are, as usual, really cool, also. Bruce Willis plays an okay tough guy in this one also, though his tantrum when he loses his watch is a little out of control. I mean, I agree that the watch is critically important to his character, but he didn't have to blow up at his girlfriend like that...And of course, the soundtrack rocks.",10,3,6,28 May 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Great and Satisfying Conclusion to a well-done Fantasy Trilogy!
","(This is a review for the Extended Cut)I don't know why some people don't like this film. Saw it in theaters, and I loved it. Watched the extended cut, loved it even more. I do have to mention that I think that the studio taking the film away from Peter Jackson and 'beefed it up' was unfair, especially since he is such a great director. However, I actually enjoyed the Kili-Tauriel romance and I think it works for the story.Having read the book (The Hobbit) several times before watching this film (and seeing the animated film several times as well), I knew what would happen at the end in regards to certain characters, especially Thorin. Yet the way the film was shot and scripted, it gave me the (albeit brief) idea that Thorin and his nephews would survive, adding extra emotion to the film for me. I thought that Smaug was also killed off too soon, especially after his spectacular iconic performance in the previous film. But his performance is still pretty brilliant.While Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are great, as usual, in their swan songs as Bilbo and Gandalf, Richard Armitage is fantastic as the tormented and troubled Thorin Oakenshield. I felt bad for Balin, though, since if you have read the books or seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you know what his fate is. But he kind of wraps his role up with a blaze of glory in the Extended Cut. Orlando Bloom gives his character of Legolas much needed depth in this film with his performance as well, while Lee Pace is thoroughly detestable as the arrogant Thranduil. Evangeline Lily is great and kicks butt as Tauriel, and the story-arc with her and Kili is a nicely-done tragic love story. Luke Evans is enjoyable as Bard the Bowman, who gets a few great action scenes. Billy Connolly is, like Smaug, woefully underused in his performance...especially since he looks so freaking awesome as Dain Ironfoot.The titular battle of the film is incredible. As other reviewers mention, it is a little similar to the Battle of the Pelannor Fields/Siege of Minas Tirith sequences in Return of the King, but it fortunately is able to stand on its own as well. After a couple of times watching, I think the Extended Cut's R-Rating is justified with the iconic battle. There is a lot of gruesome blood splatters and arterial sprays. Especially when those goat chariots come out.Besides the battle itself, the other action scenes are breathtaking, most prominently the Rescue Mission to save Gandalf at Dol Goldur. The Nazgul are quite terrifying and demonic in appearance with their awesome-looking armor and it is a great choreographed battle. I enjoyed the climatic clash between Azog and Thorin, as well, despite knowing how it would end. I kind of wished Bilbo would have had more action scenes in the film, though...At any rate, this film is a great conclusion to the Hobbit Trilogy. I hope that the upcoming Amazon Middle-Earth series will live up to what Peter Jackson has accomplished, also, since there are so many other stories in the History of Middle-Earth to be told either in a streaming format or a cinematic format.",9,1,4,28 September 2019
Prometheus," 2094 AD: The Dark Odyssey
","Ridley Scott's a great director. I grew acquainted with his filmography after Gladiator, and he is a great film-maker. I enjoyed his films like Gladiator, The Martian, American Gangster, and Kingdom of Heaven, even his Hannibal Lecter sequel and his fantasy film, Legend. Only recently, maybe in the last few years, have I discovered that he created Alien and Blade Runner. And as the last few years have proven, he has made them even better.I enjoyed Prometheus. It's a good film, and yes it has some flaws here and there. There's some great scenes and the plot is impressive. The only scene I can't stand is the infamous C-Section scene, which freaks me the heck out. Also, Much like Batman v Superman, Prometheus raises more questions than answers. I still enjoyed it very much.",8,3,4,6 December 2019
1408," Nice Contemporary Adaptation of a Stephen King Short Story
","I love reading Stephen King novels. And with the recent resurgence of his books being adapted into well-done movies (IT, Pet Sematary, Gerald's Game, Doctor Sleep), I thought I might check out some of the other recent movies made about his works. I have heard good things about 1408 by Mikael Hafstrom so I decided to check it out. I thought it was quite good.The movie revolves around the character of Michael Enslin, a formerly exceptional fiction writer who now spends his time writing cheap paperbacks on the debunking of the paranormal while traveling around looking at supposedly haunted hotels. One day, he receives a mysterious postcard from the Dolphin Hotel that tells to not check in, especially room 1408. Determined to finish his book on Haunted Hotels, Enslin manages to be able to stay at room 1408, despite the extreme warnings of Manager Gerald Olin, and soon learns he won't be getting out in his current state.John Cusack gives a great performance as Enslin, portraying him as a grieving man who is having severe trouble coping with a terrible loss. The majority of the movie revolves around him and the nightmarish ordeal in the Room. The performances of Samuel L. Jackson, Mary McCormack, and Tony Shalhoub are great also but are woefully underused.The scares in the film are done very well with a rather slow build-up. There are some parts where you think, also, that there is going to be something terrible about to happen then it doesn't, throwing you completely off-balance and when the actual scares start happening, they hit harder than you think they will.Finally, I watched the alternate ending cut, which is pretty good. I haven't seen the other cut, but I thought the ending was well-shot.",8,1,2,14 June 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," One of the most divisive superhero films ever made
","Oh, man. Where does one begin with BvS? I believe at the beginning.When I first saw Man of Steel in theaters, I loved it. I felt it was a good starting film for the DC cinematic universe like Iron Man was for Marvel. I was excited for future DC projects...right up until I read that the sequel would essentially be a major adaptation of my least favorite Batman story: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller, an (in)famous graphic novel which ended with Batman beating the living daylights out of Superman. I watched several of the trailers that came out subsequently and felt my displeasure at the film rising, especially with the 'Do You Bleed? You Will' comment at the end of the first trailer. I heard about some of the casting choices and I was not too impressed at who Snyder had chosen to play Diana and Lex Luthor, but vowed to keep an open mind. Finally, I saw the trailer where they showed Doomsday, and I knew how it was going to end since I had read a certain other comic that they were using for inspiration: The Death of Superman.Despite all my misgivings, I decided to go see the movie, since I really couldn't give a proper review of the film unless watching it. I managed to sit through most of the film, but after about two hours, I stormed out in seething anger. For several years, I openly despised and derided this film in both the Theatrical and Ultimate cuts. After watching and heavily enjoying some of the more impressive DCEU films like Wonder Woman and Aquaman, and yes, Justice League, I found that BvS was starting to grow on me in a way and I have learned to tolerate it.The film still has its poor points. Most prominent is making Batman essentially everything he wasn't in Christopher Nolan's excellent Dark Knight Trilogy. I thought the idea that Ben Affleck playing Batman and Bruce was actually good casting, by the way. However, Ben didn't portray Batman as a noble knight, but as a down-and-dirty brute. Batman openly kills several people in the film directly, but also acts as a judge, jury, and executioner towards other characters.Also, the comparisons to Superman to the Christian God got a little over-the-top, which is also something that drives me nuts about recent DC comics comparing the heroes to Gods, despite them acting incredibly flawed.Of the Trinity of DC heroes portrayed in this film, Gal Gadot is the best as Diana Prince. Well, at least around the Doomsday battle when she is kicking some major-league butt. But I thought she was way cooler in her solo movie and Justice League.Jesse Eisenberg is ridiculously stupid as Lex Luthor and thoroughly more ridiculously unbelievable than Hackman or Spacey. I know everyone compares him to Mark Zuckerberg, ironically, but this is not how I see Lex Luthor. I think Luthor should be a shrewd businessman who is like the Jared Harris portrayal of James Moriarty, not the Andrew Scott version of Moriarty who is a bratty little boy who doesn't want to share his toys with anyone.Visually, this movie is peppered with iconic shots, which is something Zack Snyder excels at. The score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL aka Tom Holkenberg is okay and slightly cool, but it just seems weird that Zimmer was brought in since he did the score to The Dark Knight trilogy films. Wonder Woman's theme is great, really, and Lex's score was the only thing I enjoyed about him, but everything else was odd with all the ominous choirs of angelic voices.Also, I think some of the characters' potentials are wasted in this film. Wallace Keefe should have become Metallo instead of bringing Doomsday in. Also, Mercy Graves was woefully underused as well as Jimmy Olsen and Perry White. Plus, the Ultimate Cut's character played by Jena Malone was a true disappointment. I would have preferred to see in the final fight with Doomsday that Aquaman and Flash would show up, as well, essentially uniting the majority of the League. Finally, I think they should have tied in the Arrowverse shows and characters. A lot of wasted potential there.That's the big problem with DC. Despite it having all its properties under one roof in comparison to Marvel back then (before the Disney-Fox Merger), DC doesn't tie its universes together for no real reason. And now with this recent news about DC splitting up its established Universe into two and not focusing on any more team-up movies, it's really annoying.Ultimately, DC has been falling apart since the immense divisiveness of Dawn of Justice in regards to its Cinematic Universe. It's had a few solid hits, and now that Marvel is done with the Phase Three films, DC has time to flourish a unified cinematic and television universe. Instead, it's just constantly restructuring itself to the point of giving up on a successful Cinematic Universe. So, in short, perhaps Dawn of Justice shouldn't have been made like the final product it was.",8,1,3,6 June 2019
