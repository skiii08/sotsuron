The Avengers," Out of your seat heart-pounding action. But one little problem.
","The Avengers starts with a bang, as the god Loki emerges through a gate in space into a remote research facility. He converts a few people to work with him, including Agent Barton, a.k.a Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). His plan is, of course, to take over the world and enslave all the humans, or as he puts it, 'free them from freedom'. S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Samuel. L. Jackson) assembles a group of superheroes including the vain Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Asgardian Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the warrior Captain America (Chris Evans), and my personal favorite, the powerful, awesome, and spectacular Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The purpose of these heroes is to combat the threat Loki. This movie was great from start to finish. Sure the director went a little overboard with the special effects, and the flying aircraft carrier was a little much. But otherwise, it was fun, clever, and exciting. Joss Whedon did a great job of mashing all these heroes, who each had their unique personalities into one film, which acknowledged each and every one of them. the humour was smart, well placed, and perfect.One thing though, is that the 3D was awful. It made the screen dark, and it made people sitting off-centre nauseous. So if you are going to see this movie, I suggest seeing it in 2D. I also suggest sitting near the wall, because during the intense action scenes, the walls vibrate and it gives you a feeling of actually being in the movie. This movie probably would only appeal to the young people, as young people love the sensation and the insanity shown in these films.",9,5,11,27 May 2012
