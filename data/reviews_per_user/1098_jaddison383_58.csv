Walk the Line," One of the Year's Best
","I have always said that it is much easier to enjoy a movie if you think it will be bad, because the good moments will jump out at you. With Walk the Line, though, I had been looking forward to it all year and was worried that I wouldn't like it as much. But was I wrong!This movie is amazing! Every single bit of praise it has received is well deserved. Jaquin Pheonix does an excellent job at portraying Cash, and it really feels as if you're looking at the real thing. The show was truly stolen by Reese Witherspoon, though. From the first moment she ran on screen, you fell instantly in love with her. When her voice soared it was incredible. She truly deserved her Oscar and has definitely proved herself a truly wonderful actress. In my opinion, she has given one of the greatest performances of all time.All in all, Walk the Line was by far one of the greatest films of the year. The music is excellent, the performances great. It rocks!",8,1,2,24 March 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Exactly What it Claims to Be
","This film is exactly what it claimed to be: An Action Movie. That is all. Nothing more and nothing less. Except for a few tries at romanticism, this film is pretty much non-stop action. And it would probably consider that a great compliment, so, in that sense, it did it's job. As my friend put it, I thought quite well, 'It was like BOOM BANG BOOM BOOM CRASH!!!!!'This is a film that, if in the mood, could be very enjoyable. And, truthfully, it does have some very intense moments that anyone will get drawn into. Cruise, if you are able to put aside all the stupid crap he's pulled outside of films in the last year, fits into his role fine, though he does border on being obnoxious, especially when he's trying to be romantic. Phillip Seymour Hoff man does well and is satisfyingly creepy. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ving Rhames, turning in fine work as always.All in all, Mission Impossible 3 is not a failure (as the box office clearly shows), but just not the best. It's not a bad movie, it just lacks any kind of depth- but what more can you expect from a THIRD Mission Impossible movie? Jay Addison",5,0,1,23 December 2006
3:10 to Yuma," A Thriller of a Western
","In a genre that has long been dormant comes this film: a passionate, fast-paced, and thrilling adventure. 3:10 to Yuma is a Western with all the classic moments you hope for, and yet enough twists and intelligence to be original.Dan Evans is a rancher at the end of his rope and in need of cash to pay off debts. By chance, he agrees to escort a captured outlaw, Ben Wade, to the 3:10 to Yuma; the train that will take him to court and hanging. Wade's gang is close behind and being led by a murderous sidekick. And there's more to both men than what meets the eye...The character of Ben Wade is played brilliantly by Russell Crowe. Wade seems like a true gentlemen when you talk to him- but then without warning, his violent and deadly outlaw self can come out. And when it does, he becomes truly a thing of terror. Though not quite as terrifying as his sidekick, Charlie Prince, played eerily by Ben Foster in one of the best performances of the year. Christian Bale plays Dan, a rancher who is desperately seeking something to save both himself and his family.With a pulsing bass-driven score and action sequences you won't soon forget, 3:10 to Yuma is well-worth a watch. While staying true to the beloved Western genre it also brought new energy and life into it, creating a film that is not only exciting, but also thought-provoking. That is a great achievement. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,3,7,17 January 2008
The Sound of Music," A Masterpiece....
","This film has always been and will always be considered a triumph of cinema. And it should be.This was the first movie I ever truly loved as a child. It was my favorite for many childhood years, and even now in my late teens I still consider it in my top ten films of all time. And I'm positive it will never be removed from that list, for many reasons.First and foremost: Julie Andrews. She gives a masterful performance as Maria. This film literally made the world fall in love with her. I know I fall in love with her every time I see it. She's the kind of person you just want to hug. I hope to have the privilege of meeting her one day.Besides just that, the rest of the film seems quite perfectly cast as well. Christopher Plummer turns in a spellbinding performance as the Captain VonTrapp, and all of the children are adorable. Eleanor Parker is also of particular note for creating a character who you so want to hate, and yet still feel the pain of. Richard Haydn turns in nice work as well as all of the actresses who play the nuns.And then there's the songs. Songs that I've grown up with and set my life to. Songs that have touched not just my heart, but an entire globe in a very special way. The songs are simple, yet reach deep within us all. Not to mention they're impossible to stop humming and singing in your head.A masterpiece this film has been called, and a masterpiece it is indeed. It is a film that will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life. It will always hold a special place in my heart- it will always be one of my favorite things.Jay Addison",10,4,12,28 December 2006
Ghost," Movie Entertainment at it's Finest
","I went into Ghost a little apprehensive. I had heard so much about it, and it was supposedly the crowning moment of one of my favorite actresses: Whoopi Goldberg. However, my apprehensions were instantly wiped away. This movie lived up to all of it's praise! It's the story of two young lovers Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore). They have just moved in together. After a night out on the town, Sam is brutally killed by a seemingly random mugger and Molly holds Sam's bloody corpse in her arms- all while Sam's spirit watches. He has been left to wander Earth and desperately try to protect Molly. He gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) a psychic fraud who has more power than she realized. Together, Sam and Oda Mae begin to piece together the puzzle of Sam's death, and uncover something much more sinister than they ever imagined.The whole cast does an excellent job here. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play the roles of grieving lovers perfectly. Ms. Moore is especially affecting. But it's Whoopi Golberg's fantastic performance as Oda Mae Brown that truly steals the show. Her performance is hilarious and endearing throughout, and she takes the film to an entirely new level. She's really is half of what makes it so good.This, in my opinion, is a great film. It entertains, it thrills you, and it even moves you. The writing is also excellent. The only place the film suffers is the special effects. Even they are fine- accept for the demons. The demons of the film are laughable. That is one major downfall. However, it's not bad enough to ruin a film that is one to be treasured. Good fun all around! 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,6,8,19 June 2007
Star Trek," Beyond the Final Frontier
","It's not clear from the opening moments of J.J. Abrams' Star Trek what we're in for. A dramatic, action-filled opening greets us on a huge scale of special effects, makeup design, elaborate sets, and emoting. From there the film zooms along, introducing us to the characters, jetting off on a thrilling plot, racing us through action, humor, and character in an incredible display of movie magic until we reach the finale and simple ending. Yet somewhere along the way something has changed. Somewhere along the way we've been completely taken in, and Star Trek has emerged as something of a masterpiece.To give away any of the plot would be to take away from what is truly a fantastic experience. I am in no way someone familiar with the original series, and guess what: This movie still blew me away. The feeling of elation filling me as I left the movie theater is a feeling the likes of which has not been produced by a summer action movie in a long time. Director Abrams has taken one of the most popular series of all time and created something current and completely enjoyable for all audiences. What's incredible is that he was able to take a material so beloved and turn it into something far beyond anything you'd ever expect from a Star Trek movie. It truly goes beyond the 'final frontier', and into great movie territory.The cast all fit the movie perfectly, providing humorous characters with just the right amount of humanity to make them completely relatable. The film takes us on a journey that is so out-of-this-earth (excuse the pun), we can't help but drink it up. The movie is paced at a great speed to keep us utterly enthralled and still allow for the appropriate amount of depth. But most importantly of all, the film reminds us what true, wonderful movie-making is all about in the first place: Entertainment. 8.5/10 stars!!!Jay Addison",9,3,9,11 May 2009
As Good as It Gets," What if this is as good as it gets?
","'What if this is as good as it gets?' So asks Melvin Udall, a selfish, rude, and very OCD romance novel author. He spends his day doing exactly as he pleases, not caring in the least about others feelings or opinions. Except for maybe Carol Connelly, the waitress at the diner he attends every morning.Wonderfully realized and perfectly acted characters are the basis of 'As Good as it Gets', a brilliant and heartwarming comedy. Jack Nicholson captures the character of Melvin both hilariously and heartbreakingly, often at the same time. Helen Hunt masterfully relates the many different layers of Carol, giving one of the most realistic performances I think I've ever seen on screen. And then there's Greg Kinnear, in one of his best roles, as Melvin's gay neighbor who becomes his friend. The only person I didn't care for was Cuba Gooding Jr. His overacting felt out of place and annoying amongst these other masters at work.'As Good as it Gets' is all too often pushed aside as just a silly romantic comedy, but it's so much more. Melvin and Carol relate to each other in a moving and amazing way. He is selfish and rude, so much that she can scarcely stand to be around him for an entire evening. Yet in the same moments they are clearly soul mates intended only for one another. She is the only one who can put up with him, and he sees in her a beauty that words can't really describe. There are moments when you'll love Melvin and see the wonderful human being inside-yet seconds later he'll destroy that feeling by his stinging words. Yet Carol can put up with him. Carol can forgive him. Carol can love him.Much like their relationship the movie is hard to describe in words. See the movie. You'll understand a little better then. All I can say is that if this IS as good as it gets, then I'm happy. An hilarious and heartwarming film. 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",9,1,2,12 May 2008
The Notebook," Give yourself in to the emotion and you'll do just fine...
","Regarded by many as one of the greatest chick flicks ever made (many would say the best love story), 'The Notebook' has become very widely-viewed and popular. It has many flaws. The acting of the younger lovers is not too great, and the sappiness can be exhausting at times. On top of all that, the film goes on far too long.BUT... If you can allow yourself to look past all of that, what you will find is a genuinely touching love story. Indeed, you probably have a heart of stone if some scenes don't honestly move you. Trust me, I'm not one for dumb cheesy Hollywood romances, but the older pair of this film is lovely. Gena Rowlands deserved a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her smaller role.The best way to watch 'The Notebook' is by forgetting inhibitions and letting yourself become absorbed in the emotion of the story. Give in to the sappiness and 'The Notebook' works just fine. 6/10 stars! Jay Addison",6,1,2,19 March 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The loss of humanity...
","When the X-Men series first premiered it was at the dawn of the new age of superheroes, and it was something of a revelation. For the first time, we were presented with mutants, heroes that were completely relatable. Instead of watching a campy B Movie, we were transported into an impossible world that seemed entirely plausible. While holding on to a great spirit of fun, the X-Men examined themes deeper than superhero movies; acceptance, identity, compassion, and forgiveness.It's clear from the very beginning that X-Men Origins: Wolverine contains none of that. From the early-America set opening to the special effects overload finale, we are treated to nothing more than skin-deep cheesy pop. Even the cast list confirms the film's empty notions.Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber lead the cast as mutant brothers without a place in the world. As the film rushes forward with little to no room for thought, they are approached by Col. William Stryker to join a top secret team of mutants going around the world on unclear missions. However, it's not long before the massive amount of killing being done becomes too much for our hero and he leaves the team to try and live life as a common man away from it all, which is, of course, impossible. You know where it goes from there.Unfortunately even the ample charms of Mr. Jackman can't save this unadmirable dud. Despite having the makings of a decent plot on their hands, the film dissolves into nothing more than actiony silliness. That would still be somewhat acceptable, if it weren't for the tint it leaves on the source material. Instead of finding ourselves transported back into the thought-provoking wonder world we came to expect from this series, this thoughtless money-maker feels nothing but shallow. And with the recent advances made by films like The Dark knight and Iron Man to turn the superhero genre into a form truly respectable, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a dark spot in the repertoire. Do yourself a favor: skip this one and stick to the great original series. 3/10 stars, and that's a compliment.Jay Addison",3,11,24,10 May 2009
Juno," Better than Little Miss Sunshine...
","Juno is the story of a free-spirited teenage girl who gets knocked up by her best friend on their first try at sex (it was her idea!). With the help of her best friend and supportive parents, she finds a 'desperately seeking spawn' couple in the penny-saver ads and agrees to the adoption. But Juno's pregnancy is going to have an affect on everyone in ways she never thought of...This film is much better than the film it most reminds me of: last year's Little Miss Sunshine. Much like that film, this one is a major Oscar contender for Best Picture, but even more so for it's star, Ellen Page.And she is wonderful in the lead role of Juno. Miss Page plays Juno to perfection, creating a wise-cracking, sarcastic, and independent young woman and does an amazing job of never making her seem like a caricature. Her Best Actress nomination would be well-earned. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but Jennifer Garner especially sticks out in the role of Vanessa, a woman who wants to be a mother more than anything. I'm hoping Ms. Garner gets a Best Supportin actress nod as well.The witty and original script by Diablo Cody sizzles. She is also guaranteed a Best Original Screenplay nod- she has the most buzz of anyone and is as much star of the film as Miss Page. Jason Reitman directs in a quick and lovely way, a good match in director for this film. It is a rather crude movie, especially at the beginning, but that is to be expected just from the premise.Give Juno a look at your local cinema. The only caution I would give would be to not bring younger children to it. For more mature viewers, it will be well worth your money; a smart, well-acted, and very funny film. 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",8,3,13,14 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirate movies are hard to hate...
","In the third and final chapter of what is quite possibly the most popular movie series of all time, we find Will and Elizabeth Turner on a voyage to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker. Once that is over, the entire movie is taken over by a theme never as strong in the series as now- Every man for himself. Every main character in this film has his/her own agenda and will stop at nothing to reach their goal. By the climactic scene, you don't know what the heck's going on. One of the funniest scenes is right after they rescue Jack: Will, Elizabeth, Barbosa, and Jack all instantly point their guns at each other. After a moment, they laugh and let them down- then they all aim at each other suspiciously once more. In this simple scene, we find the heart of the movie.Everyone is back for this final installment. Orlando Bloom plays a rather selfish Will Turner. Kiera Knightly plays a much more stand out of an Elizabeth. Then of course, there's the infallible Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa, and the now-legendary performance of Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy, Naomie Harris, and Kevin McNally all contribute nicely as well. Truly, the cast is never a problem at all. This films main problem is that it is so damn confusing! Throughout, there are about twelve hundred different stories involved, and by the end we just have to assume that it is all resolved. We can't really tell what exactly happened.But....The movie does not fail for this. It's hard to dislike the movie, for the same reason (in my opinion) that the series has been saved all along: It's a pirates movie with probably the best actor's who could possibly bring it to screen. What more do you want? It's the kind of fun film-making that in this day and age has mostly disappeared from the theaters. So, despite plot holes galore, hard to follow story lines, and more, we still like this movie. And we'll still continue to like it. There's probably not too much they could have done to make people dislike this movie. Honestly, I enjoy loving it for no real reason. They're just fun to watch! So, the Pirates of the Caribbean comes to an end with a final film that stays true what has been the creedo of the films all along: We're here to have fun. That's why we love these movies. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",6,1,3,27 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A wonderfully thrilling fantasy!!!
","Hellboy II thrives in all areas; the performances are top-notch, the script is sharp, and the production and make-up design is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Director Guillermo del Toro has followed up 2006's masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth with one of the best movies of the summer.When the Heir to the Throne of an ancient civilization of elves plots to awaken the deadly and indestructible Golden Army, it is up to the societal outcasts at the Federal Bureau for Paranormal Research to save the day, once again led by their witty, charismatic, and endearing leader Hellboy.As far as fantasy films go, this one might go down in my book as one of the best. The monsters are something amazing to behold, creations to stick with you long after you leave the theater. The action sequences are well-shot and quick. The special effects deliver perfectly. Most amazing of all though, is the real character and endearing story injected into all of it. It's easy to fall in love with these freaks, especially played to such perfection by Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, and Doug Jones.I suppose I can see how Hellboy would not delight everyone. It is a fantastical story, not based at all in reality and it is a film that delights in making it's audience chuckle. For me that ability to laugh makes it all the more endearing. Easily one of my favorite films of the summer! 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",8,3,7,13 July 2008
Cloverfield," An Intense Experience...
","Cloverfield is probably one of the greatest examples of a concept movie ever made. And by that I mean it is a great concept movie as well. It's the story of a giant monster attacking New York City seen through a hand-held camera. We follow a small group of 20-somethings as they try to escape from the horror that is unfolding around them, and we get pretty close to experiencing it with them.Frenetic, intense scenes is the name of the game here. The hand-held camera is a clever twist that makes this visually exhausting film unique. Even at it's very short length, the film almost runs too long- you feel very tired by the time the credits roll.JJ Abrams was clever in his use of little to unknown actors, and they all do a good job making it seem pretty natural. The best of these is Lizzy Caplan in a nice supporting turn. The special effects are all fantastic and extremely believable and SCARY, another plus to this film. Most of the plot works well, though a romantic side-plot for the lead character feels forced at times. If you want an intense viewing experience (and have a strong stomach), Cloverfield is definitely for you. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,1,5,20 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," A Fairy Tale of a Different Kind...
","Fairy tales can come in many diverse forms. We have what Disney has given us, the old stories themselves, Shakespearean plays are even largely inspired by fairy tales. This film, however, is a fairy tale entirely of it's own kind.In the last stretch of the Spanish civil war, there are some last remaining insurgents fighting the new regime, and to destroy these groups there have been military posts set up in the countryside. It is into this world that young Ofelia is forced into when her mother marries the Captain of one such post- She is carrying his child. But in this dark and dreary place, something sinister is brewing. With war raging around her and her mother's health declining, Ofelia must escape the world around her... and recede into a world of her own.The film is astounding; It is unlike anything I've ever seen. The only thing it could have done any better would have been a bit more character development, but that is overshadowed by the overall effect of this stunning story. The performances are all wonderful, with Ivana Baquero playing Ofelia perfectly. Sergi Lopez does a fantastic job as the Captain as well, slowly developing his character into someone you truly loathe. The film was really stolen, though, by Maribel Verdu as Ofelia's friend Mercedes. Ms. Verdu was robbed of a Best Supporting Actress nomination.The real star of the show is what's on the screen: Director Guillermo Del Torro has created a fantasy land that is a feast for our eyes. The set design here is incredible- If there is an Oscar for that, this film should have won it. The set design is only complimented by the beautiful cinematography, which both never distracts from the plot and is also one of the best parts of the film, all at the same time. And it is all helped by some of the best music written for film in a long time by Javier Narrate. The soundtrack is gorgeous!It is true Pan's Labyrinth is unlike any fairy tale you've ever heard of; it is most definitely not for children. However, it is a tale that you'll never forget. Sit down and revel in a fairy tale of a different kind... 9/10 stars!!! Jay Addison",10,1,6,7 August 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Nothing Short of a Masterpiece
","As a director, Tim Burton has made a collection of eccentric and altogether different films that have been greeted with mostly positive praise. He has legions of devoted fans that think him the most brilliant man in the world. His skills have always been considered something special, and altogether different.Sweeney Todd is the crowning achievement of his career. If this film does not sweep the Academy Awards, they are some seriously bad judges.Everything here is done to perfection, creating a world unlike anything you've ever seen. Visually, the film is stunning. Everything from set design to costumes and make-up is done wonderfully. Then there's Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in two of their best roles, giving Oscar-worthy performances. They are also surrounded by a very talented supporting cast. All film-making aspects are put together perfectly.But in the end, it's the amazing story that makes it something truly incredible. As someone who has never seen the stage show, Sweeney Todd literally took the wind out of me by the end; this tale of the evil of humans and the blinding power of revenge and greed is something you'll never forget. Apart from the leads of Sweeney (Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Carter), there are two smaller characters who work their way in as contrasts to the anti-heroes. They show the desperate hope that people hang onto amidst the evil of men, a hope that can scarcely survive. This is a story of a man blinded by rage and driven to madness. It is at the same time both terrifying, disgusting, and heartbreaking. Not to mention darkly funny.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is probably one of the finest creations ever put on film. The only thing that could hold it back from Oscars is that it is based on previously written material. If it were an original motion picture, there would be no competition. Do yourself a favor and see this masterpiece on the big screen, but don't take the kids: It is, at heart, a horror film. 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",10,3,7,23 December 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Just the same as the others...
","Ocean's 13 is the ending of one of the most successful series in recent years, and it finishes it off much the same as the rest of the films: fun, tricky, and completely free of deeper meaning or value.I am a fan of both of the previous Ocean's films. I seem to be just about the only person who really enjoyed Ocean's 12, but I thought it was probably the funniest of the three. Ocean's 11 definitely remains the best of the group, as well it should, and 13 is probably my least favorite. But that doesn't mean it wasn't any good. It was fun and funny throughout.The story is simple- at least for an Ocean's movie. One of the gang, Reuben falls deathly ill after being screwed over by Vegas tycoon Willy Banks (Al Pacino). Therefore the crew set out to destroy Willy by making his newest and grandest casino (the one he was supposed to share with Reuben) a flop. And they pull out all the tricks, some ingenious and some just absurd.The film was fine, and that was all. I didn't leave it raving or excited, but I also certainly didn't leave it disappointed. Except for one thing: Neither Julia Roberts nor Catherina Zeta-Jones was present for this film, and that was disappointing as they were my favorite parts of the other two film. Without them, the guys are just okay entertainers in my opinion. I will say, though, that Ellen Barkin did a wonderful job in her (unfortunately) small part. Of the guys, Matt Damon was probably my favorite.So, the Ocean's films end with satisfaction and humor along for the ride. I don't really understand the raving that this one was so much better than the others, because, in my opinion, they're all on the same level. I'm very glad this series was made, but I'm also glad it's ending. Three films is enough. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,0,1,29 June 2007
We Are Marshall," Go Matthew, Go Matthew, Go!!!
","This is an excellent example of a movie that the greatest thing about it is it's lead performance. Yes, I'm talking about Matthew McConaughy. An actor who I never in a million years thought I would find myself praising, he truly shined in this film.This is the true story of the town of Huntington, West Virginia. As the Marshall University football team and several prominent town-members were flying home from an away game, the plane crashed, taking the lives of everyone on board. Leaving the town and the college devastated and many families ripped in two, it seemed all hope was lost. The four remaining varsity members, however, were not going to give up. They fight to keep the program alive, and eventually get approval from the board. All that is needed now is a new head coach. Enter Jack Lengyel, otherwise known as McConaughy himself.Unfortunately, this film is not the best. It's not terrible, but it is also most definitely not great. The story is sad, but then it never reaches triumphant status. There's simply much better sports movies, especially better football movies(Remember the Titans, anyone?).It is worth it, though, simply for Matthew McConaughy's inspired performance. He plays the head coach Jack Lengyel with ease and endearing. He is the perfect combination of country and intelligence. What makes his performance even greater is the humor he adds to a movie that desperately needed it. You cannot help but get caught up in his enthusiasm. He creates a character that everyone would want to get to know. The rest of the cast is fine, but can't seem to outshine the man himself.In summation, it's definitely not the best movie of the year, and it's nowhere near the best sports movies list. However, it's lead performance makes it most definitely worth a watch. 5/10 stars.Jay Addison",5,2,6,18 March 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Quite possibly the cutest movie ever made...
","This is one of them- one of the films that is essential from now on to our culture as what film-making should be. While delivering an hilarious script, the superb cast also teaches the audience some very important lessons about what each of our lives can become if we spend our days trying to be better than everyone else. That competition can get so fierce that we end up destroying ourselves in the process.But now I'm preaching...This film is brilliant: Hilariously funny, touching, smart, and it contains some of the best performances of the year. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are both great and hilarious. Better even then that: They give real depth to their characters that could have been so clichéd and stereotypical. But it's Meryl Streep that truly steals the show. This film ahs made me a die-hard fan of hers forever. She will blow you away, more than ever before. Months later, and I'm still quoting her. Really, it's just a really fun and enjoyable film for anyone and everyone- don't miss it! One of the best of the year 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",8,1,2,23 December 2006
Forrest Gump," Thoughtful, Funny, and Simple- More Than Meets the Eye...
","Forrest Gump is a film that has a lot to live up to. Many people consider this one of their favorite films. Plenty of critics put it down as one the better films ever made. As someone picking it up for the first time over ten years after it was made, I was apprehensive of what to expect.Yet, just like the character, the film Forrest Gump is never pretentious even from the very first minute. We meet Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for a bus to come. Someone sits down next to him, and Forrest begins to tell his life story. Simple, poignant, and ridiculously funny is this tale of a man who accidentally finds his way into every major event of his generation. Forrest changes the world in unimaginable ways, but all he really wants is Jenny, his childhood friend and the girl he's loved his entire life.Yet this simplicity is where the movie's strength comes in. Everything is really very simple for a man whose IQ is no greater than 75. This simplicity deceives us into taking a whimsical tale for granted, and then surprises us with its incredibly moving final scenes. We don't quite realize how wrapped up in Forrest's world we are until we find ourselves in tears by the end. And when we leave Forrest's world, we miss him very much. We miss his easiness and simple way of living. 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,1,3,15 September 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine's Heart of Gold
","This movie was always advertised and talked about as a laugh out loud comedy- and it was. But more than all of that, it was a touching and heart-warming story about a completely and totally dysfunctional family... a family that truly loves each other.Olive wants nothing more than to be in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Redondo, California. She's the young daughter of a family that includes a failed motivational speaker father, a brother who's taken a vow of silence, a grandfather who's addicted to heroine, and a mother who just loves them all. On the day that her mother's depressed and suicidal brother joins the family, Olive finds out that she gets that chance she's dreamed of. And now it's up to her family to get her there in their old VW van that barely works. However, the trip is only half the fun- once they arrive, the result is hilarious... and downright moving.The whole cast is pretty fantastic. Abigail Breslin is plays quite possibly the most adorable little girl ever, and her performance is wonderful. Toni Collette is also brilliant as the mother of this motley crew, and Steve Carrell is also perfect. Their performances are easily the most underrated part of this film. At the same time, Alan Arkin's rather simple performance is the most overrated.In the end, it's a story about love; love of the oddities and quirks of this family that both constantly threatens to tear them apart and also makes them love each other most. It takes this little girl to help them see that. A wonderfully funny and deliciously sweet film that will last for a long time. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",8,0,2,22 July 2007
Disturbia," Not exactly disturbing....
","DJ Caruso's Disturbia is a rip-off at heart. It never plays that way, though, which is one of it's saving qualities. However, Hitchcock's Rear Window is definitely the inspiration here. It's a great idea. Unfortunately, this version couldn't quite seem to decide what genre it was.Shia Lebouf plays the lead guy, Kale. He witnesses his father's death in a car accident, and becomes withdrawn and sullen as a result. This attitude leads him to punch one of his teacher's in the face, which lands him under house arrest. He can only go 100 hundred feet from his house, or the police will be there in seconds. Soon, he finds himself becoming a peeping tom on all his neighbors, including new neighborhood hottie Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and possibly homicidal neighbor Mr. Turner. This is where the movie gets a little confused. For about the first hour and a half, it can't seem to figure out whether it's a horror, comedy, or even possibly a romance. Some of the drama that occurs between Kale and his new girlfriend Ashley is downright stupid. On the other hand, though, when it gets to the horror parts, it does it superbly. The comedy pretty much stays intermixed throughout, which is odd. That's kind of how I would describe the entire movie.Shia Lebouf does do a fine job of acting. He proves himself better with every movie he's in. Sarah Roemer also actually does an excellent job with her easily over-played part. The always dependable David Morse also is sufficiently terrifying as the killer next door neighbor.So really, Disturbia is not awful. Most of it's elements are very well played out. There's just a bit too many elements in the mix with this one. The script could use some work. 6/10 stars.Jay Addison",6,6,13,21 April 2007
Dreamgirls," Well Done- Yes, Well Done!
","A great time at the movies- one of the best times I've had all year. And not only that, this is also just a great movie. Something about it brings you in right from the start and never lets you go. You don't want to be let go. In fact, you're sad when it's over.This is the story of three girls who join together to form a singing trio. They are hired backstage at a talent contest when the legendary singer James 'Thunder' Early's back-up singers run out on him. From there, their street-smart and tricking manager moves them further and further up the ladder of success- unfortunately, there's pain and heartbreak along the way. Their manager will stop at nothing to bring them and himself glory, and the consequences are somewhat less than a dream. This amazing story spawned what is truly the best picture of the year.The music is one of the main reasons. There's something about sitting down in a theater and watching a great musical that still takes your breath away. And this is definitely a good musical. The only thing that could have been better as far as the music goes, is they could have put more of the characters singing to one another from the beginning. The first time it happens, it seems kind of unnatural. But from then on you embrace it lovingly. Great songs handled excellently by the performers.And the performances, the performances!!! Beautiful work by pretty much the whole cast. Beyonce gives the best performance of her career as the girl who ends up singing lead for the trio. However, the stand-out performers easily are Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy portrays the aging singer Early who ends up giving up a lot of what he believes in for success. He struggles with doing what his soul tells him to do, and what his manager says. His final scene got the whole audience cheering and applauding in my theater. And Jennifer Hudson- well let's just say she deserves every single bit of praise she's gotten. She'll blow you away.As the movie ended, after a moment of awkward silence, I began to clap- and then the entire theater gladly joined in. It went on for some time. Everyone was cheering. The movie is that good. Go see it!!! It is as good as it gets. Truly, a dream come true! 9/10 stars, and it deserves every one!Jay Addison",8,2,4,21 January 2007
She's the Man," Another Success
","I have to admit, when my friends first asked me to go see this movie i was a little apprehensive. Amanda Bynes is so gorgeous as a girl the thought of her as a boy was revolting. But then the lights dimmed and the movie began. And I have to say I was impressed! Once again, the girls that brought you the teen hit '10 Things I Hate About You' have pulled of another one! The story was catchy, the laughs were real, and the performances were surprisingly good considering that it's a bunch of teens. The whole audience would roar with laughter over and over again, just proving to me as '10' did that Shakespeare knew his stuff.The success of this show is due largely in part to the excellence of Amanda Bynes. Besides having excellent comedic timing, she also proves herself to have an amazing talent for physical comedy, particularly in a certain girls bathroom fight scene.And who can resist that smile? So, I have to say congrats to those girls again. They have scored another teen hit with this movie and turned a classic play into a totally hip modern movie. One has to think that if Shakespeare saw these films about his plays, he would be proud.",6,1,3,31 March 2006
Enchanted," A New Kind of Fairytale...
","With Enchanted, Disney returns to really good family film-making. More recently, the studio has been releasing dumb very immature 'comedies' such as The Game Plan. Enchanted does what some were beginning to think Disney could no longer do: appeal to the adult audience coming with the kids. Giselle is an animated princess-to-be on her way to her wedding to Prince Edward when his Stepmother Queen pushes her into a black pit in a desperate attempt to hold on to the crown. Giselle is sent into the most terrifying world of all: Ours. She is rescued by Robert, an engaged father who doesn't believe in love- but Giselle must of course fix that. Problem: our Princess is soon followed by her lover Prince, his servant, and eventually the Queen herself... and New York will never be the same.Amy Adams stars as Giselle in this fairy tale with a twist, and star is indeed what she does. Her energy flows from the screen in an irresistible and delightful way. There is talk of an Oscar nomination for Ms. Adams, and I must say I would agree with it. She pokes fun at the classic Disney princesses at the same time as respecting them and becoming an icon herself. The rest of the cast all supports nicely, James Marsden sticking out particularly as Prince Edward. Mr. Marsden is one of my favorite comedic actors, and he's at his best here.And of course it's a story about love, promoting happily ever after blatantly. What makes Enchanted special, though, is that the characters debate the reality and even need for happily ever after in today's world. Giselle is thrust into a modern day that doesn't instantly accept true love as natural or even possible and she can't understand this. Where she comes from, chance romance equals true love. 'Let's be married tomorrow!' cries her Prince two minutes after she meets him. In this new world, though, people aren't so easy to believe. Giselle is desperate to convince everyone around her that love is forever, though they're very reluctant to accept it- and that's what makes it brilliant. For the first time, Disney isn't all instantly happy endings and true love with a prince. For the first time the Princess begins to realize that love is flawed and imperfect; but that doesn't make it any less of love. At heart, Enchanted is a light-hearted comedy/musical that fits nicely into Disney's other such films. It's filled with good morals, good-hearted characters, and good clean humor. But it also discusses what real love is all about, a subject Disney has been a bit overly optimistic about in the past. That's a lot to pack into a little kid flick. 7/10 stars!

Gone with the Wind," A Classic for a Reason
","I saw a show about the writing of this film before I ever even saw it. Besides that, I naturally has heard of it, about it, and praise for it millions of times. It is considered a classic by all. The seeing of the show about the writing made my 'need-to-see' at highest.I was not disappointed. This film is beautiful. Not only is it amazing in it's beauty, but it's amazing in the fact that it really is a pointless film altogether- Yet it is definitely an undisputed classic in my mind forever now. I will probably buy the DVD.It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled, selfish, and stuck-up girl in the South who finds herself caught in the middle of the Civil War. She spends her life yearning and doing whatever she has to in order to get whatever she wants. She lies, slaps, and acts like a promiscuous girl throughout- yet she never gives up. The one thing that may save her is Rhett Butler, a bad soul himself who loves her- and may be the best man for her.Vivien Leigh gives one of history's greatest performance as Scarlett. She captures the character completely and does something even more impressive: She makes us feel for her. Then there's the incredible Clark Gable as Rhett, the secretly tormented man. He's brilliant, as usual. Of other particular notice is Olivia de Havilland as Scarlett's one true friend, Melanie. She is easily the most lovable character in the film. Just beautiful, providing an exact image of everything Scarlett could be.Yes, it's amazing that this film is as well-liked as it is. Perhaps, though, it's not so surprising after all. It's a beautiful story about two people who are absolutely horrible, and yet will steal your heart every time. The story goes on for almost four hours, and it seems hopeless at times for Scarlett. Yet she keeps moving on. She never gives up. That's really what the movie is about. To quote: 'Tomorrow is another day!' A classic, indeed! 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",9,2,3,26 April 2007
No Country for Old Men," A Raw Western Masterpiece...
","In a world that becomes increasingly violent and harder to understand, people often get to a point of quitting. At times, the world can seem like a thankless and mindless place; often that is true. No Country for Old Men channels this current feeling.A simple man comes across a case full of money from a drug deal gone bad and decides to take it. He is pursued not only by his hometown sheriff and a bounty hunter, but also by a serial-killing mad man. The game of cat-and-mouse that follows is one you won't soon forget.Superbly acted, memorably written, and thrillingly directed, this is one of the best films made in a long time. This is the first movie by the Coen Brothers that I have watched- I'll have to see their other work now. Everything here is done with skill and purpose. The result is a Western thriller that wonders if maybe there is no hope for better times.I have to talk about the acting again because it is astonishing. Josh Brolin gives a subtle and surprisingly tender performance, and Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful in his perfectly calculated role as a world-weary sheriff. But it is Javier Bardem who steals the show with his terrifying portrayal of pure evil in the form of a cold-blooded killer. This is an actor I just might be frightened to encounter on the street. Mr. Bardem will win the Oscar and deserve it.In a year of few fantastic films, this one stands out. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen while you still can; it's well-worth the ticket price. 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",10,1,4,4 February 2008
Mamma Mia!," A Wonderfully Entertaining and Uplifting Musical
","Mamma Mia! What more needs to be said? In the latest Broadway-to-film adaptation to hit theaters, Meryl Streep stars as Donna, whose daughter, Sophie, has discovered all three of her possible fathers by reading her mother's diary and has now invited all three to her Greek Island Wedding. From the first moment 'Mamma Mia!' starts you know you're in for a unique and uplifting experience, and the film does not disappoint that expectation. Full of catchy pop songs and fun choreography, this is one musical that embraces its flamboyance for all it's worth- and comes out the better for it.The cast is all having a great time and it shows. Meryl Streep turns in yet another wonderfully entertaining performance and creates a character unlike anything we've ever seen from her before. Her Donna is a heroine for middle-aged women everywhere, a funny, saucy, and utterly lovable mom. Then there's Donna's two best friends played to comedic brilliance by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Any moment those two appear on screen you know is gonna be great. Amanda Seyfried also turns in a fine performance in her first semi-leading role as Sophie, and her 'fathers' (Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Stellan Skarsgard) all deserve praise for committing to such a different project for all of them.I'm sure that there will be many people who will refuse to enjoy 'Mamma Mia!' and find it over-the-top, silly, and utterly cheerful. But if you open your mind and let yourself give in to the infectious happiness radiating from the screen you're in for a wonderful ride. It is over-the-top, silly, and utterly cheerful; it's also utterly entertaining and enjoyable. Mamma Mia indeed! How can I resist ya??? 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,2,4,18 July 2008
Twilight," A Harlequin Romance for Teens?
","There was little doubt that Twilight was going to make millions at the box office. The books literally have become a phenomenon, with girls of all ages (and even some boys) delighting in their passionate, twisted love story. The inclusion of a vampire as the male lead was simply the extra dose of daydream fantasy that set the story on fire.You probably know the plot. A young independent girl moves to a new town, meets and falls 'irrevocably' in love with a vampire, a member of a clan of strictly animal eaters. The fact that her blood is the most attractive blood said vampire has ever smelled (What a coincidence!) only heightens the passion.Yet despite the steamy, sappy premise, the film somehow manages to make the relationship between the two leads truly captivating, much to the credit of the talented actors, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. The chemistry is positively electrifying between the two, and it's hard not to get excited about this complicated love affair. Despite more that their fair share of terrible lines ('You're like my own personal brand of heroin'), these two pull the whole thing off remarkably well.The film certainly has its moments of pure silliness, and when the bad vampires come on screen (as they must) it really gets a little dumb. Despite the admittedly interesting inclusion of vampires, the movie has little gritty feel to it, which is unfortunate. Of course, it never has much hopes of moving beyond its harlequin premises, a fact reinforced by the inclusion of indie rock songs and the final scene being set at the high school prom. Ick. The movie never has aspirations beyond its pop culture material. However, the high school love affair themes are what made teenage girls lap it up.Don't dismiss it immediately, though; Twilight isn't terrible. It has its high moments (and its lows), and the overall effect is satisfying. The emotion of the characters doesn't seem forced, and the human side of the story plays itself out pretty well. It never really seems like a real movie, but rather a somewhat cheaply-made book adaptation; which I guess is what it actually is. Honestly, though, the two leads truly recommend themselves, creating an utterly watchable romance. Their newly-discovered superstar status feels somehow deserved after this admirable effort. 5/10 stars...Jay Addison",5,0,2,18 May 2009
Seabiscuit," Very Exciting and Moving Even!!!
","When Seabiscuit was first released to theaters, I had absolutely no desire to see it whatsoever. The three girls in my family who had read the book were adamantly for seeing it and insisted we all go. I walked into the theater expecting to be bored for two hours.But I was sure wrong!!! This movie is the perfect example of a film that has taken an overall boring subject and made it into something extraordinary. Each cast member performs splendidly, and you really feel for each and every one of them. Tobey Maguire's lead performance is nothing short of amazing, especially the bond he creates with the horse. Jeff Brodges and Chris Cooper also turn in excellent work as his owner and trainer, respectively. Also a splendid(and Academy Award-nominated) performance by William H. Macy as the radio DJ Tick Tock McGlaughlin. I truly believe all these performers made4 this movie the best it could have possibly been.Because Seabiscuit isn't really a racing movie, or a sports movie- it's a beautiful and touching look at how the relationship between this horse and this man could change so many lives, and, ultimately, change America. The last scene still gets tears from me every time.So, sit back, relax, and keep some tissues ready. This movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, laughing out loud, and even tearing up. Truly a very good film.Jay Addison",8,6,8,20 December 2006
Cars," Pleasantly Surprised!
","When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked uninteresting and unfunny. My family dragged me to see it last weekend, though. I was amazed! This movie rocked! True, it was very different from the other Pixar movies. I kept thinking that this one had so much more of a story and so much more real drama, instead of just trying to make people laugh (which it did). They were literally trying to tell a real, genuine story with CARS as the characters.The scary part? It worked! The plot was excellent, the story was touching (my sister actually almost cried), and the characters were adorable. It was super cool!Oh, did I mention it was hilarious? Watch for a particular 'Tractor Tipping' scene! No way you can't laugh!!! 7/10 stars!!!Jay Addison",7,0,0,21 June 2006
Schindler's List," An Unforgettable Experience...
","This is a film that will be remembered forever. There's not many films that can boast that, but this film definitely can. It is truly one of the greatest films ever made.Oskar Schindler started off the same as most of the men of his Nazi party: He loved women, good wine, and making money. He started a factory in the middle of the war and made money using Jewish slaves as workers. He sold parts to Nazi armies, eventually becoming one of the nation's wealthiest men. As he began to be invited into the inner circle of the Nazi's, though, he began to see the horrors of what was really going on; He began to see the horror of himself. And he began to try to save the Jews.Shot in stark black and white with rare glimpses of color, Schindler's List is a true masterpiece. Steven Spielberg completely recreates what is one of the darkest times in human history with startling reality and shows a new generation exactly how terrible it was. At the same time an uplifting story, a horror film, and a dramatic saga, Schindler's List will forever change you. It is a not a lighthearted film to be enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon- it may disturb you. But it is a must-see for everyone so that we can better understand what really happened in that terrible war. Superb film-making is all around in this film. A must see! 10/10 stars! Jay Addison",10,9,13,12 December 2007
I Am Legend," Interesting social commentary...
","Will Smith gives a killer of a performance in I Am Legend; the man definitely has acting chops. You have to give credit to a man who can keep a one-man show interesting. In fact, he almost had me in tears at one point.I Am Legend is a film to be savored for it's more thoughtful moments. It's set in a New York City that has been wiped out by a deadly virus. If the virus doesn't kill you, you turn into a monster/zombie/vampire that can only exist in the dark. Dr. Robert Neville (Smith) is the lone survivor, a famous scientist who is still desperately trying to save mankind.Despite breathtaking shots of deserted and overgrown New York, the effects are rather lacking here. The monsters are one of the main disappointments of the film. Without giving anything away, I will say that several of their behaviors in the film seem, as strange as it sounds, ridiculous and over-the-top. What is good, though, is really pretty good: The film's message of fate and purpose go over well and are indeed rather hope-inducing. The film also makes a clear point of how mankind will eventually destroy itself. It's no random thing that a cure for cancer is what causes the outbreak. Humans are never satisfied to stop pushing things further, trying harder and harder to rule every aspect of our lives. When we try to play God, there will be consequences.I Am Legend is a fine film- it just didn't achieve greatness. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",6,0,2,1 January 2008
School of Rock," The Creation of Musical Fusion...
","Every now and then a mainstream entertaining film comes along that breaks the boundaries of what we expect and turns itself in as a truly great film. School of Rock is one of those movies. Sharp direction from Richard Linklater, a talented cast, and a fabulous script from Mike White meld together to create a heartfelt, gut-bustingly hilarious tribute to rock 'n roll that will make a believer out of anyone.Not enough praise can be given to Jack Black in what is truly the greatest performance of his career. As Dewey Finn, a down-on-his-luck guitar player/singer who pretends to be a substitute teacher in place of his friend and forms a band out of his class of ten-year-olds, Black creates a laugh-out-loud hilarious hero for the ages. Never on screen have I witnessed a more passionate, genuine performance, and the film is truly what it is because of him. He speaks about rock 'n roll as something 'pure' and 'awesome', and every word is filled with love and admiration. Extolling the virtues of rock 'n roll to his classroom, he talks about 'creating musical fusion' and how 'one great rock show can change the world.' What makes the whole thing work is that Black truly believes every word he's saying. And so do the kids.The movie never stops being funny and yet still manages to maturely show the deeper changes Black affects in the students lives, from helping an unpopular boy gain confidence to encouraging an overweight girl with her self-consciousness issues. And it's not just about the kids either; it's a personal journey of self-discovery for the main character as well. In the same way the the kids help him to find meaning in himself, he helps them come alive from their drab and plain school days. The film even goes so far as to subtly suggest the flaws of the educational system and the lack of values put into special talents.But without ever delving that deep, School of Rock is still a masterpiece of comedy that is impossible not to enjoy. And when that final rock show scene is reached, it's one of the most emotional, rocking moments in history. It IS musical fusion. It IS something pure, and cool, and awesome. And it is a genuine, verifiable triumph that you get the feeling might just change the world. 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",9,1,1,2 June 2009
Moulin Rouge!," The Witnessing of Masterpiece...
","Moulin Rouge! never concerns itself with reality, possibility, or the common things of life. No, this is a film that shatters all preconceived notions of what a movie looks like and embraces the bizarre and the beautiful with arms wide open. Director Baz Luhrmann has created something utterly unique, a movie the likes of which I doubt I will ever see again.The Moulin Rouge! is a risqué cabaret in the Underworld of Paris in the early twentieth century. When a young and naive poet comes to the show in hopes of writing it's very first real production, he falls in love with the cabaret's star, Satine. On the very same night, a rich duke who is considering financing the club to turn into a respectable theater is basing his decision on the charms and devotion of Satine. All is played out to dramatic and exuberant musical numbers.Luhrmann directs his cast to perfection, with Nicole Kidman delivering one of her best (and Oscar-nominated) performances. Ewan McGregor, Richard Roxburgh, John Leguizamo, and particularly Jim Broadbent all deliver wonderfully charismatic performances as well. And the music!!! Using groundbreaking compilations of modern pop songs reworked as musical numbers, the soundtrack is simply enthralling from the very first moment. In the areas of costumes, makeup, and art direction, the film is monumental.There is a strange feeling of both energy and exhaustion that overtakes you as Moulin Rouge! comes to a close. It's a feeling that is rare not only with films, but with life in general. It is the feeling you get when you realize you have seen a masterpiece, and it is the feeling you will no doubt have when you witness Moulin Rouge! 9/10 stars!!! Jay Addison",8,1,3,9 October 2008
World Trade Center," It Has It's Moments...
","Well....not what I expected, to say the least. I expected action, I expected drama, I expected to cry and be moved. I expected to see a film that would touch me, move me, and make me proud to be an American.This film did none of those things.It has potential, no doubt about it. In fact, if a great 9/11 movie is ever made, it could easily be one of the best ever made. This film is definitely not a great film. It focused the entire time on two men trapped under the rubble, trying not to 'go to sleep' and thereby die. The only other stories it worked on were the reactions of their wives, who seemed quite alright about the whole ordeal. No, the wives performances was not very satisfying at all. Maggie Gyllenhaal touched on what could have been a great performance several times, but it seemed obvious the director didn't like that direction. Never did one of them even break down. They almost got there more than once, but never quite reached it.That's basically the whole film: It touched on greatness, occasionally delivering a good scene. Yet it never seemed to take that angle of mourning and sadness that was obviously needed. And in the end, the whole film ends up being a lot like the wive's performances- just not very satisfying. Pity.... 5/10 stars is it.Jay Addison",5,0,3,21 February 2007
The Dark Knight," A Truly Amazing Achievement
","In this new age of superhero movies' box office domination, we've been treated to the good, the bad, and the ugly, the cool, the silly, and the utterly enjoyable- then along came the new Batman series. Batman Begins redefined the limits of what we thought superhero movies could achieve. With The Dark Knight, director Christopher Nolan has done something even more incredible: He's created an instant classic. Huge in scope, fully realized in story, and amazing in entertainment value, The Dark Knight is an honestly fantastic film. From the very first action sequence we can tell that we are leaps and bounds ahead of the predecessor. The Dark Knight deals with things so realistic, so intense that I would be quick to say that it's not even a kids movie. It becomes so much more than a superhero movie, digging so much deeper into the human mind, and emerges as a thought-provoking, incredible masterpiece. Yet it still retains that superhero charm.The film-making is all extraordinary. Nolan shows himself to be a master of suspense and storytelling. The screenplay is so smart and so quick that you might not catch everything even after several viewings, but it all still somehow works together perfectly. And the cast is perfect, particularly the incredible Heath Ledger. It would be a lie to say this film could have been what it is without him. His performance as the maniacal, anarchic Joker is the stuff of legend; it will haunt you long after the credits roll.The Dark Knight is the movie of the year. It is a masterpiece, and a blockbuster that mesmerized people like no film has in a long time. It deserves to be remembered forever. 9/10 stars!Jay Addison",9,3,8,7 March 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Best Potter Movie Yet!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had a difficult job from the beginning; Harry is an emotional and unhappy boy throughout. He is now 15 years old and the hormones are kicking in. Oh, and it doesn't help that Lord Voldemort has returned and is trying to control his mind, all while a teacher from Hell has taken over Defense Against the Dark Arts... along with a few other things. By the end of this year, Harry and his friends have to take matters into their own hands. Fortunately, the Order of the Phoenix, a society bent on destroying Voldemort, is right behind them.Director David Yates does a wonderful job with what was probably the most complex book. His vision is very obviously different from the previous three directors, but it just might be the best. As a die-hard fan of the books, I expect a lot out of the movies- Luckily they just keep getting better. This one is the best so far.One has to give some credit for that to Imelda Staunton playing that teacher from Hell I spoke of: Professor Umbridge. She is absolutely perfect, and her performance is Oscar-worthy. Doubtful she'll have a chance, but I'm definitely rooting for Best Supporting Actress. Her interpretation of this character is so spot on, so evil through fake niceness, she inspires fantastic performances from the returning actors around her. They are all back at the top of their game with this one, in particular Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman as Professors McGonagall and Snape, respectively. The scene between Professor McGonagall and Professor Umbridge is one of the most intense in the movie. The other cast member who shines the brightest is Gary Oldman as Harry's godfather, Sirius Black. He just might have you in tears by the end.And there are some pretty intense scenes here. The last 30 minutes of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It's fantastic film-making. The action sequences are done wonderfully, and the dramatic scenes are wonderful, too. The only downfall is that the film starts out pretty slow and can seem long at times. All in all, though, Mr. Yates has done a fine job with the story, and I hope he's back for the next round. I know I'll be there Opening Night. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7,0,0,20 July 2007
Annie Hall," Funny and Charming? Definitely. Classic? Maybe...
","Of the Woody Allen films I have seen, this one is the best. As usual, Woody is concerned with a love story. Alvy Singer is a neurotic and hyper comedian who meets and falls very quickly in love with the flamboyant and ditsy Annie Hall. We follow their love story as it's told to us through short sequences that are not necessarily in chronological order.Diane Keaton is superb as the titular character of Annie Hall. Her Best Actress Oscar was well-deserved. Woody Allen, essentially playing the same character he always does, seems to be at his best here too. It feels almost as though this story had special significance to him.A lesson in ironic comedy, Mr. Allen uses unique storytelling and humor to engage his audience and surprise them. The characters say whatever comes to mind, speak to the camera, and talk to random strangers on the street- yet somehow this only makes them seem more real. And yes, it makes them very funny, too.If you're a die-hard fan of Woody Allen, you just might think it's the best movie ever made. For the rest of us, it's mostly a light-hearted and endearing romp. No matter where you fall in those categories, it's definitely worth a watch. Jay Addison",8,3,5,8 April 2008
Avatar," James Cameron's political action extravaganza...
","Avatar is not the best movie of all time. Let's get that out of the way right now. It might be one of the biggest, just like director James Cameron's last film, Titanic, was. And since comparisons to that other Cameron classic is inevitable, let's talk about it right now: Avatar is not as good. Titanic was a huge epic event movie and yet managed to deliver a story that was undeniably personal and human; Avatar doesn't quite do that, and therein lies its greatest weakness.But let me back up a few steps: Avatar is a very entertaining and thrilling ride, and most definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Filled with breathtaking imagery, dazzling effects, and grand storytelling with big emotions, it's exactly what a crowd-pleaser is made of. Unfortunately, grand storytelling has a way of becoming lost within itself. Cameron's script is strongly lacking in the dialogue department. The words coming out of the character's mouths often feel dry and fake, though the cast does its best with the material. Of particular note is the wonderful Zoe Saldana, taking the difficult role of the Na'vi princess and filling it with genuine humanity and emotion. Yet perhaps her very personal performance stands out like it does because the rest of the movie is so broad. This is evidenced even by the running time, a whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes, a length that is felt on more than one occasion.Still, Avatar shouldn't be dismissed, and it won't be. As ticket sales already show, this movie is going to be around for a long time, and love for it will flow profusely. Yet there's also something more to Avatar; it is an inherently political movie. The story of the indigenous people being pushed out of their home and impressed upon by the invading humans does not allow for a non-political movie. What's amazing about Avatar is the innocent way in which it brings about its message and the subtlety with which it convinces you of its truth. Cameron uses his tale and its great big emotions to present us with stark images of military extremity and (let's face it) American consumer selfishness. It's quite notable that a movie can get us to root against the evil humans and have the main character refer to them as the 'aliens' by the end. Even the most lightweight film viewer will find it almost impossible not to notice the strong messages, and one must give Cameron props for the way he makes a movie set on an alien planet hit America right at home. The way the themes are naturally embedded in the story allows for easy relatability, and makes it easier for us to consider that some of our methods need to be reexamined.Avatar is a two-sided film. On a purely entertainment-focused level, it is nothing more than a thoroughly enjoyable, great big action extravaganza, but it has major flaws. However, you have to admire a mainstream film that can examine such relevant issues in thoughtful, honest ways, and promote the most simple message of all: Peace. Jay Addison",7,0,3,2 January 2010
Titanic," An Epic Love Story LIke No Other
","Titanic is probably the most unlikely successful films of all time. It really was no kind of provocative theme at center. It was quite simply an epic, and an epic LOVE STORY at that. Yet, this film went on to be the most successful movie of all time, both in the box office and the awards seasons.The movie does what many people thought would be absolutely impossible- It takes you back to the Titanic and truly captures exactly what it must have felt like when the 'unsinkable' ship went down. Through a love story that moves everyone who sees it, characters that are diverse and fascinating, and probably the best cinematography ever put on screen, it makes you feel about this story in a way you've never felt before. And that's what makes it so amazing. It changed the way people looked at this story forever. It made them truly understand the tragedy of what happened that night.The acting is fantastic. Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job and was very under-appreciated for this performance. However, the reason for that is because no one could take their eyes off of Kate Winslet. This movie made her what she is today. Her performance is still fantastic as you watch it even now. The movie was hers from the moment she came on screen.It's true that it is, at heart, a love story, but it's not only about the two central characters of Jack and Rose. To me, the real love story is about the Titanic itself. Before I saw this movie, it was an interesting story and that was all. Because of this movie, and the vividness it portrayed, it is a story I'll never forget. It's become a story that will never die in the hearts of people, and the movie is what truly did that. It changed the way that people thought of Titanic forever.I think Bill Paxton's character said it best right at the end: 'All my life I've thought of nothing but Titanic, but I never really got it until now.' I understand Mr. Paxton- I feel the same way. An absolutely fantastic film, and probably one of the best ever made. 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",9,2,4,25 June 2007
Psycho," Thank You, Alfred Hitchcock!
","Alfred Hitchcock is clearly one of the greatest directors the world has ever seen. He proved this to me with Psycho, a film that has transcended time and technology to remain a masterpiece. It is ahead of its time in all its aspects: Cinematography, music, even the fantastic performances from the incredible cast. And it is all put together by a master: Mr. Alfred Hitchcock.Most people by now know the classic story: A young woman stuck in a road-blocked love affair steals $40,000 in a desperate last attempt to make a life with her boyfriend. She stays the night at a deserted and somewhat decrepit old motel, where she meets a young man who may not be quite what he seems. I won't say more. I was lucky enough to know nothing about the story when I watched it, and it only made my experience all the more thrilling.I must give credit to the absolutely perfect performances from each and every cast member. Both of the leading ladies are excellent. Janet Leigh plays the woman who stole the money, Marion Crane, while Vera Miles plays her sister. But of course the show completely and totally belongs to Anthony Perkins in what is probably one of the greatest performances ever given. He plays the young man who runs the old motel, and is our titular character. What Mr. Perkins did with this character is brilliant: He's a seemingly kind and attractive man. It's pure brilliance.Yes, Mr. Hitchcock gave us a true masterpiece with Psycho. It remains still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I had trouble getting to sleep two nights afterwards! The film is shocking as well as groundbreaking. Thank you, Alfred Hitchcock! 10/10 stars! Jay Addison",10,0,0,13 August 2007
War of the Worlds," A 'Fun with Friends' Film
","This is not the best movie in the world. In fact, this is not even Oscar material at all. However, it's a fun ride the whole way through. It's also a great movie for watching while you're hanging with your friends.War of the Worlds starts with a divorced man (Tom Cruise) getting his kids for the weekend from his ex-wife. He has a son (Justin Chatwin) and a daughter (Dakota Fanning), who, unfortunately, love to make him feel like crap. Then, the aliens come out of the ground after a major lightning storm, and suddenly this dysfunctional family is stuck together as they race for their lives.The problem with this movie is that it never achieves what it sets out to do. It certainly seems like Spielberg is trying very hard to make a real family sub-plot with this, but I just couldn't understand why the kids hated their father so much. To me they just came off as spoiled brats. Well played spoiled brats, but brats none-the-less.Dakota Fanning truly does shine. She is definitely one of the most promising young actresses out there. Though her character is not the most likable, she acts the character out with style. Justin Chatwin also does a fine job as the son. And though I hate to admit it, Tom Cruise does a very nice job with this film. He handles the lead role very well, and you really do feel for him. Now, if only he would get over Scientology....War of the Worlds is a fine example of a summer box office hit. In that element, it did exactly what it was supposed to. No, it's not an amazing film, not a ground-breaking film; but it's fun to watch. That's why I call it a 'Fun with Friends' film. Next time you and your friends are getting together for a night together, pop this one into the DVD player. It will be perfect for the night. 6/10 stars! Jay Addison",6,0,2,21 March 2007
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," An Unlikely Film of Soul...
","In this age of super-broad comedies and sexed-up teen films, there comes Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. It's all-too-easy to groan at the thought of sitting down to a high school film these days, yet 'Nick & Norah' attempts to make you rethink that. It tries to achieve that so rare of an achievement; it tries to make a genuine and honest teen comedy.It succeeds.Michael Cera, that king of adorable dorkiness, stars as Nick, the sole straight member of a queer-rock band. Kat Dennings plays Norah, a rocking rich chick who is just as unattracted to teenage pettiness as the rest of us are. These two meet through a random encounter and together set out to try and find the secret show of the aptly titled rock band Where's Fluffy? They cruise the town like grown adults, yet underneath both are incredibly naive. They argue, fight, flirt, and, yes, fall in love; what makes the film great is how mature and honest a relationship they create. We know from the beginning that it is the destiny of Nick and Norah to get together, yet when they do it is nothing short of soulful. With a wonderfully witty script along for the ride, it's apparent that this is much more than your average teenage comedy. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,81,95,27 October 2008
There Will Be Blood," A Very Well-Made Film, but No Best Picture
","I don't quite understand why There Will be Blood is being given praise such as 'the greatest film ever' and 'best picture of the year'. This is certainly not the film I saw.Paul Thomas Anderson's epic tale of greed, pride, and selfishness is indeed a masterpiece in terms of technical achievement. While giving respect to classic film-making, Anderson's film feels very new. Large credit for this has to go to the groundbreaking original score by Johnny Greenwood of Radiohead. His score is unlike any orchestral composition you've ever heard, very eerie and almost tense. I know that one of the people I saw it with said they hated the score. I thought it served its purpose quite well. Besides that, the directing really is very well-done with eye-catching cinematography, great costumes, and good writing.But let's get down to the real thing: Daniel Day-Lewis. There is no denying that his performance as oilman Daniel Plainview in this film is truly the best of the year, really of many years. He creates a character that is truly heartbreaking and disgusting in his utter disregard for anything but his own success. Even when he can feel the disappointment in himself, he can't bring himself to change his ways. He still serves only himself and can't stand to see anyone else succeed. Paul Dano also serves up a brave and somewhat disturbing performance of his own as the hellfire preacher who opposes Daniel.The film however is far from perfect. Several subplots are hard to follow and one in particular is very confusing. I still can't quite make sense of it. Obviously some kind of symbolism was meant, but it didn't come through. And the film is very long, too long in fact. The first fifteen minutes are pure silence, a unique beginning that got old fast. While the story of Daniel is truly heartbreaking and intriguing to watch, many of the story lines are drawn out far too long. Some have called this 'character development'- I call it slow moving. It's high-time for the end when it gets there.At heart, There Will be Blood is a character sketch of a really despicable man. The story is certainly worth watching, however unfortunately drawn out. Don't go in expecting a light and stimulating time at the movies- you won't get it. This film's a real downer, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But perhaps with this film you're just down too long. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,3,7,6 February 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Enchanting, Sweet, and Too Funny!!!
","This is a story about a man named Harold Crick, and his wristwatch. Those are the first line you hear Emma Thompson say over the action. The wristwatch actually plays quite a large role in this film- it really determines the ending. And though your first thought might be that this would be a ridiculous film, think again. This film is excellent.It's a story about a man, Harold(Will Ferell, in one of his best roles), who has lived his entire life in the most ordered and planned way possible- he does the exact same thing everyday. I mean, the man counts his brush strokes every morning while brushing his teeth! Then one day, he begins to hear a voice that is quite hilariously narrating his life. Then, the voice says he will die. Harold freaks, and sets off to try and discover what he can do about this very serious problem, and by doing so he starts a brand new life that will make him do things he never dared to do before. And yes, he stops counting his brush strokes.Smartly, the film never comes off as heavy-handed or overly-dramatic. It keeps a light and very humorous tone throughout the whole film while still delivering a great story. Will Ferell gives a very sweet performance as Harold, and you can really connect with him as he changes. Dustin Hoffman is also good as the literary expert who Harold seeks out to help him discover who the voice narrating in his head. Queen Latifah does fine in her rather small part, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is enchanting and sweet as the woman Harold falls in love with. The best part of the film, though, is Emma Thompson's captivating performance as the author who is narrating in Harold's head and so desperately trying to kill him off in her latest book. She gives on of the best performances of the year and makes herself the stand-out of the film by far. But, we've come to expect such great performances of Ms. Thompson. She gives one of her best in this film.This is an over-all fun, original, funny, and very sweet film. I've seen it twice in theaters, and plan to buy it on DVD. The underlying message about living your life for the best it can be, and the overlying sweetness and light-heartedness of the film work together perfectly to create one of the best films of the year. 9/10 stars!

The Terminal," What Are You Waiting For?
","Viktor Navorski is on his way into New York City when he is told that his country has been annexed from the inside- It no longer technically exists. It seems that this has placed him in a 'crack' in the system- There is nothing that Head of Airport Security Frank Dixon can do but let him live in the airport terminal- So that is what Viktor Navorski does: He lives.The story here is truly the star of the show. Through his foreign eyes Viktor allows us to see the irony of our rushed and ridiculous American lives. He also changes the lives of just about everyone he meets. As Viktor himself discovers, everyone is waiting for something; everyone has something they're yearning for in their life. Yet it is those of us who stop waiting and just soar who truly are happy.And much thanks for that has to be given to the amazingly talented cast. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Viktor; You know it's a great performance when you completely forget about the actor and just see the character. Catherine Zeta-Jones is spot-on as a truly selfish and love-desperate woman who has realized what love really is for the first time. Stanley Tucci is excellent once again. However, it is Kumar Pallana as the janitor who reluctantly befriends Viktor who stole the show for me. Really, there's not a bad performance in the film.Steven Spielberg's legendary directing is superb, and we feel like we truly know the character's and have lived this amazing story right alongside them. The cinematography is lovely and cleverly sets up the humor of the scenes.The Terminal is definitely one of the best movie's of it's year. The humor is fun throughout, the performances are all wonderful, and the story and message are unforgettable. So, what are you waiting for? Stop waiting and soar. Truly a wonderful film! 7/10 stars!

Music and Lyrics," It's Cute...
","Really, it is a cute movie. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore work well together. Both of them give fine performances. The real stand-out, of course, is Kristen Johnston best known from Third Rock From the Sun. She was quite funny! The main downfall of the movie for me was the Cora Corman character. It was obvious that the director told her to act so stiff and non-responsive, but it was a bad decision. I think the character could have worked better if she had just played it as a whining pop star, so that was a disappointment. The final song, however, ended up being really beautiful. A great song, coming from a movie that really did all I wanted it to do- It made me laugh, kept me entertained, and provided an easy night out. 6/10 stars! Jay Addison",6,2,4,2 March 2007
The Queen," Quite good, indeed...
","Yes, I must say that this film does deserve all of it's nominations from the Academy. It was, indeed, a very good film. Besides just having a wonderful leading lady, a fine director, and a well-written script, it had more to it's name- It's just a very beautiful story.The Queen of England is faced with a situation of what to do when Princess Diana is killed. She is demanded by the people to become a 'public mourner' and change the way she's lived her entire life, all for a woman who chose against her family and stood for everything the Queen didn't.Helen Mirren gives a fine performance in the lead role. She transforms herself completely into the character, and is instantly believable. You cannot help but understand what she's going through. She deserves her Best Actress nomination. Other than that, the supporting cast is generally average. Michael Sheen does turn in nice work as Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister who very much stands for change.Ultiamtely, it's just a very good look at a very good woman. An excellent script from a very good story, and a wonderful leading performance. Don't be surprised if you are near tears more than once. There is one especially lovely scene near the end with a little girl holding flowers for a very special person. That scene is just one of many excellent throughout the film. A good movie, indeed. 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",9,0,0,25 January 2007
Step Up," Exciting, Charming, and Insightful
","Perhaps all that can be said against Anne Flecther's Step Up, is that it left you wishing you could watch it more- and as we all know, that is what a movie sets out to do. From it's exciting beginning to it's edge-of-your-seat anxious ending, this movie ruled. It provided a deeper sort of story than Hollywood generally is brave enough to do, yet still made it easy for teens to watch and enjoy. The dancing was beautiful and exciting, the drama felt real, and the side stories were insightful and charming. I adored all of the side stories. The little tales of the main girls best friends getting together, to the Principal and Tyler's fight to accept one another, to the tragic story of his young friend's tragedy- all these things only made the movie better and more interesting. The only thing that really could have been done better were those side stories- they could have gone into a bit more detail. That would have made all the difference. They chose to stick more to the main story, though, and the movie was still entertaining and certainly enjoyable. See it. It's a lot of fun! 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7,0,2,4 September 2006
Iron Man," Great Acting and Sharp Directing make this a Must-See...
","All to often, superheros turn into geeky, rather dull characters when they get out from behind their various costumes. 'Iron Man', on the other hand, in a stroke of brilliance, makes it possible to love the man behind the metal mask even more than the hero itself. For the first time, we're not dealing with a dual personality here- Iron Man and Tony Stark (his true identity) are one fully realized character.Mr. Stark is the rich young owner of a huge weapons dealing company. While displaying his newest creation for the army, he is captured by terrorists who order him to build them a bomb of their own. It is in this place that he has a revelation and escapes with one purpose in mind: He must retrieve the weapons that he himself distributed.Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on perfect in the lead role. He somehow blends sarcasm and real caring into nearly every line. The result is someone we can laugh with, yet also genuinely care for. As Pepper Potts, Tony's longtime secretary/caretaker/love interest, Gwyneth Paltrow delivers the goods once again, playing both hard-to-get intelligent and still very girly. The relationship between the two leads plays wonderfully, never going into schmaltz or typical lovey-dovey-ness. Instead, their interest in each other is not hardly addressed up front, yet through great performances is made clear. Jeff Bridges adds his own flavor as Tony's business partner.Director Jon Favreau keeps the pace quick and the editing sharp, bringing the excitement to near boiling point at times. Yet he also shows an intelligent and graceful hand with the more plot-centered scenes, in particular the ones between Tony and Pepper. All in all, a fun and exciting way to start off the summer. Check this one out on the big screen while you can! Jay Addison",8,3,6,9 May 2008
Casino Royale," A Riveting Adventure From Start to Finish
","I have never seen a James Bond film before. I am by no means a fan, simply because I've never had the intense desire to. When this film was released, it got stellar reviews from all of my friends. I decided it was time to take a look at the series.This movie was great.This is the story of Special Agent James Bond on his first mission in his newly appointed '00' status. He is sent by M to capture La Chiffre, an illegal arms money dealer. Bond has no idea what he is in for. He faces every kind of problem imaginable, falls in love, and almost loses his life three times. Despite that, this movie was convincing and exciting the entire time.Daniel Craig plays an excellent Bond. He puts together the perfect mixture of charm, wit, charisma, and cockiness which eventually almost destroys him. The other cast member who did a superb job was the immensely talented Judi Dench as the head of The Agency, M. She manages to keep it believable and never overplays a role that easily could have been. Instead she uses both tough and caring together to give a very nice performance.Truly, it's most definitely a great movie, and probably one of the best of it's year. I only found one plothole, but in a movie of this kind that's to be expected. Only one plothole is actually impressive. This is a fun, riveting, and exciting adventure the whole way through. It's made a fan out of me. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",8,1,3,12 April 2007
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," An Epic Fairy Tale...
","Sometimes Oscar season can get way too caught up in itself. Too many times you'll head to the cinema only to find that there is nothing but heavy-handed, deep-meaning dramas. Elizabeth: The Golden Age breaks from that with gusto.It is the story of Elizabeth I as she must fight for her throne as the Spanish try to steal it away from her at all costs. At the same time, Sir Walter Raleigh, a somewhat noble pirate, enters Elizabeth's life and draws her attention away from national affairs... and onto him. An epic story of love and war follows in one of the best movies I've seen this year.Cate Blanchett is breathtaking in her portrayal of the Virgin Queen. Every scene, every line, every feeling is done to perfection by this phenomenal actress. She plays Elizabeth with pride, strength... and fear. I'm definitely seeing a Best Actress nomination for this one and probably a win. The other standout is Samantha Morton as Mary Queen of Scots. There is certainly some Oscar potential for her as well. The film looks amazing on screen as well, with gorgeous cinematography and wonderful costumes, all complemented by a grand swelling score.Some people have said that the plot had not much story to it, but I didn't really see that at all. I was entertained the whole time and there was definitely a plot twist I did not see coming. Granted, some of this I'm sure came from the passion Ms. Blanchett poured into each scene. The pain she's going through inside is completely heartbreaking. The film is at the core a fairy tale on a grand scale, but what a wonderful thing to watch.Yes, in a time of year when epic tales are not so common to be seen, The Golden Age is a gem. Go and see it on the big screen while you can. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",7,2,6,17 October 2007
Shall We Dance," A sensible and timeless story of the heart.
","Every year, there are dozens of films made that try so hard to reach a little deeper, to hold on a little tighter, and to leave us breathless. Every year there's either one good one or (most often) none at all. This film was the exception. From the opening moment of getting to know this main character, we get the instant feel that is portrayed throughout the entire film- a feeling of real life. This movie is brilliant simply because it is so believable, and so filled with love. It grabs you from start to finish and never lets you go. It is a story about real life, and the beauty that it holds. It is a sensible and decent story that provides a look into what our lives could and should really become. This is the story of a man searching for a meaning throughout the film, only to realize that his meaning has been right in front of his eyes the whole time. An ensemble film at heart, this is one of the greatest casts I've seen in years. Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, and Jennifer Lopez all turn in fantastic lead performances, and share the screen well together. It's the supporting cast that really makes the movie, thoug, Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter stick out in particular as two dancers made for each other. Both actors are quickly making their way to my favorites list. The entire cast puts in superb work.Yes, it's a story about life as we all can live it. As Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez dance in the dark studio alone at night, you worry, for a split second, that the film will slip into the old and used form of movies- but it stays better. Because life is not a fairy tale and it's not a passionate romance- but if we learn to appreciate what we already have around us, we can, in essence, find the fairy tale in our own lives. And that's what makes this movie so great. It teaches us to appreciate and love the beauty of our own lives, and it's a lesson we can all learn. 9/10 stars!!!",7,0,0,19 February 2006
Coach Carter," A GREAT Sports Movie
","There's no denying that in today's day and age the sports movie genre has become tired and clichéd. Every year we see more attempts by Hollywood to cash in on the same 'inspiring' story, again and again. But from this defunct genre comes Coach Carter, a wonderful little film and probably one of my favorite sports movies.Samuel L. Jackson superbly plays Coach ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach who locks his players out of the gym when they don't uphold contracts concerning their academics. Jackson is a revelation here, playing a really good guy and turning in one of the best performances of his career. Met with opposition even from the staff, he fights for the idea of a student-athlete for the first time. Calm, cool, and dominating the screen, the film is worth seeing for Jackson's performance alone.Yet Coach Carter is something more. It's one of those rare sports movies that really hits home, avoiding most of the clichés that have messed up the genre. It's true, there's still the troubled athletes, the obligatory girlfriend-of-the-star; somehow Coach Carter isn't weighed down by it. In fact, quite the opposite, it's a movie that truly soars. 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",8,0,0,11 March 2007
Contact," Fascinating and True....
","This movie still interests me every time I watch it. No, it is most certainly not a great or perfect film, and definitely not the best of the decade, as some have claimed. It is, however, a fascinating show of what would happen on Earth if Alien Contact were ever achieved. Everyone would freak.This is the story of a young scientist named Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) who has lived her entire life believing that there must be something else out there sharing the universe with us. Otherwise, it seems like an awful waste of space. After fighting a losing battle for years to keep her program alive, she finally discovers an alien message by complete chance. After further study, they then discover that it is the blue-prints for a machine to be used to send someone to (presumably) meet them. With that news spread to the world, so begins the chaos of human reaction as the world must decide how to act on this data.The story is brilliant, one of the best things about the movie. We have all wondered at one time or another in our lives if there were other beings trying to contact us from outer space. Could there be intelligent life-forms out there? If so, what do they want- are they hostile or benign? This is the question that is posed for America in this film, and the country reacts exactly as I imagine it would in real life: Skepticism, over-reaction, and fanaticism all inter-mingling with each other. The portrayal of how the human race reacts is so true, that it feels frighteningly real.The cast works very well at their individual roles. Jodie Foster shows her real acting chops once again as the dreamer-of-a-scientist who really is searching for just one thing: Meaning in her life. The supporting cast does just what they're supposed to: support. Matthew McConaughy plays the role of the man who is stuck between two worlds just fine, and James Woods, Tom Skerritt, David Morse, and Angela Bassett all turn in nice work. The real stand-out of the supporters is William Fichtner as Ellie's blind mentor. He does very well.It's a fine movie, one of the better science-fiction dramas for sure. However, it's not amazing, nor is it ground-breaking. It's just fun and interesting to watch every time. After all, that is what movies are supposed to be. 7/10 stars!

The Pursuit of Happyness," It's a film you really want to like...
","Expect to cry when you see this film for the first time. Some of the scenes are very emotional, and very sad as well. And yet this isn't a movie you leave feeling terrible- it's a movie of hope. It's a movie you really want to love.Will Smith gives a stunning performance as Chris Gardner, a man living on the streets with his son as he tries to get hired as a stockbroker. Smith's performance is beautiful and he truly gives the performance of a lifetime. His pain looks and feels completely real. He deserves the Best Actor Oscar. He's that good.His performance is only made twenty times better by the touching and truly amazing story. For a long time, it seems that nothing can go right for this man. It seems that the world is really against him. He loses everything- yet he still has hope. He holds on to that distant hope that drives and connects with us all. That distant hope that he feels translates to the audience in a way that we can hardly understand. We only know it's a feeling that we don't want to ever lose. We all can feel lost and out of luck at times, but this inspiring film tells us we have to keep moving and keep trying. There is hope in the distance, and though the struggle may be fierce, when we reach that hope it's worth it all.So, yes, this is a movie you really want to like, and it is very easy to do so. It offers hope to a sometimes hopeless world. And, in the end, it is impossible not to love it. 7/10 stars and it deserves every one! Jay Addison",7,1,1,14 January 2007
Cinderella Man," SLOWLY, but surely!!!
","This was not a bad movie. It was not a great movie either. It;s an excellent story and a great performance by Paul Giamatti. It's main problem is it's slow!!! It speeds up as it moves along, but it's especially slow in the beginning. I also didn't think Russell Crowe OR Renee Zellwegger were at the top of their game. However, as previously stated, Paul Giamatti does give an outstanding supporting performance. He makes the movie worth seeing. It was never not worth seeing in the first place! There are simply better inspirational stories, though, and even better boxing movies (Million Dollar Baby for example). However, it's still definitely worth watching at least once. It is a very nice story. 6/10 stars for me, and no more.Jay Addison",6,1,3,21 January 2007
Atonement," A Beautiful Film
","'Atonement' is a true Oscar film. It received seven nominations- and it deserved every one. It's the story of Briony Tallis, a young writer who sees something she thinks she understands, but really doesn't. When she accuses her sister's lover of a heinous crime, it changes the course of three people's lives forever.The cast is wonderful here, with Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy giving perfect performances in the roles of the two young lovers. Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garei, and Vanessa Redgrave all play Briony at different points in her life. Ms. Redgrave is especially affecting in easily the smallest part.All production values are done perfectly, with great direction from Joe Wright. Cinematography, art direction, costumes- all very well-done. And that music!!! What a fantastic score, intriguingly mixing sound effects and music together. It's a shoe-in for Best Original Score.In the end, though, it's the heart-wrenching story that makes the film a masterpiece. As much mystery as it is romance 'Atonement' is never boring, but always changing and moving. And as far as endings go- this one is perfect, unlike anything I've ever seen. Whatever you do, don't spoil it for yourself! If 'No Country for Old Men' doesn't sweep the Oscars, it will probably be because 'Atonement' was right at its heels. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen while you still can! 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",8,3,4,24 February 2008
