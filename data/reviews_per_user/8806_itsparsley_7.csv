The Rock," Michael Bays best film to date
","The Rock is one of the best action films of the 90's. A great cast, excellent concept, and slick polished look put this movie at the top of its league. This is Michael Bays best film to date (as of now Transformers 2 has not come out, so we'll see if that changes). The cool thing about The Rock is that it manages to win over many who don't care for action movies. It spends plenty of time developing its characters and doesn't rush into things too quickly. The payoff is more than anyone could ask for and there is a decent amount of comedy that doesn't get in the way of the intensity. The Rock is not meant only for the action fan bases but for anyone interested in a quality adrenaline rush.",7,2,2,21 February 2009
Deja Vu," Tony Scott has mastered his craft.
","Tony Scott has become a fantastic director during his run in Hollywood doing bigger budget films and cheap shorts. Man On Fire takes a step into an experimental direction that went even further on his next movie, Domino. After Domino Tony could really do anything and have it come out visually stunning. In Deja Vu he takes on the idea of heightened reality with giving a grittier feel to the image and going hand held with plenty of zooms in all the right places. You lose the idea that you're watching a PG-13 film because of this and you get the feeling you're viewing an R rated picture. Like Man On Fire, Deja Vu starts off in one direction and moves quickly into another. It's only every once in awhile that action movies bother to stand out and be different from the heard. Deja Vu dares to do this and succeeds magnificently.",7,1,2,11 May 2007
Hot Fuzz," I enjoyed this just as much as I enjoyed Shaun Of The Dead.
",The boys are back with a new comedy that this time spoofs the action genre. So what are we given? Pretty much the same amount of laughs that Shaun Of The Dead gave us along with some pretty nifty action and gore scenes in the mix. Although I felt that maybe 10-15 minutes could have been shaved off there wasn't too much to complain about. The style felt like it was mocking the modern day Tony Scott. The references to other action movies were hilarious. If you look away from what this movie is trying to do than you might get a little off track. You'll pretty much enjoy this movie it's really just a matter of how much you'll enjoy it. All in all Hot Fuzz brings good laughs.,7,1,2,9 July 2007
BASEketball," Surprisingly hilarious!!
","I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit. Don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come. Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.",7,0,2,5 February 2007
Grindhouse," Planet Terror - 7 Death Proof - 8 Fake Trailers - 8
","So far Grindhouse has been one of the best films of the year. If you're a huge Rodriguez/Tarantino fan like myself than this is the ultimate experience. The fake trailers were down right hilarious and to be honest I could have watched plenty more. Starting off with the Machete trailer was a smart move. What wasn't a smart move however, was starting the double feature off with Planet Terror. I'm not saying it's a bad movie but it's a 90 minute, guns firing, non stop action, over the top violence, balls to the wall zombie film. What you've done is worked the audience up to be on this drug-like high where they want more fast, funny, adrenaline. Death Proof may be the exact opposite of this. The audience realizes that they have just sat through an hour and a half and that they now have to sit through another hour and a half AGAIN. It's time to get them in gear and make that 3 hour running time feel like 30 minutes. It's a shame too, as I felt that Death Proof was the better of the two. Many others however felt like it had 'too much dialog' (it's Tarantino, what do you honestly expect?) and not enough Kurt Russel. Look, in order for us to LOVE Kurt Russel we must be teased by him. Give us a little Kurt here, a little Kurt there, and we'll be dying for more. But who am I to argue that as I would have loved more of his character!? Decide for yourself but this is without a doubt one of the more unique, explosive, and hilarious times you'll have at the movies.",8,0,0,9 July 2007
Con Air," Fun 90's action film
","One thing the Hollywood pulled off in the 90's were solid, successful, action films. With an all star cast, fun characters, great comedic relief, a very polished look, and classic action sequences; Con Air is sure to be one ride you won't forget. The only scenes that feel a little too over the top were the door flying right past John Cusack and certain aspects about the ending. When it comes to action movies we are supposed to cut a little slack, so if you do that with Con Air you will come out ready to go back for another viewing. Like I've said before, action movies these days are sloppy and reckless. Con Air soars above today's action films.",7,1,1,7 February 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Best action film of the summer! Die Hard packs a punch and leaves your adrenaline flowing.
","While many were skeptical about the 4th installment of the Die Hard series I had a feeling that Bruce Willis wouldn't return and tell us it was as good as the first unless he really stumbled upon something special. Before attending the jammed pack midnight showing I read some early reviews that were all looking positive, I had a really good feeling about this movie. As an action fan I have grown to be more and more disappointed with the quality of this genre, so I could only pray Live Free Or Die Hard wouldn't put it to shame. Fast forward. The moment the final credits come up my entire theater gives the film a standing ovation with plenty of cheering. I was so incredibly satisfied with my experience that my only complaint was I couldn't immediately go back for a second viewing. You really have to give action flicks a lot of rope, if you do that with Die Hard 4 it'll blow right past your expectations. What a relief! I had read about the possibility of another Die Hard about 10 years ago, this was well worth the wait! It's also great to see a big scale film that didn't heavily depend on cgi. If you enjoy action movies than this is a MUST see.",8,2,5,9 July 2007
