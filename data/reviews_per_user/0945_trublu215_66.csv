The Finest Hours," While it has its heart in the right place, The Finest Hours can't seem to rise above its sappy melodramatic storyline.
","The Finest Hours tells the harrowing and courageous true story of the most daring rescue mission that the U.S. Coast Guard has, to this day, ever had to accomplish. Starring Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster and Josh Stewart, the film's cast is stacked to the brim with talent but the director, Craig Guillesspe takes away from their efforts by telling the story in the sappiest of ways. The film starts with Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) on a blind date with his friend as he looks forward to meeting Miriam (Holliday Grainger), the woman he has been talking on the phone with for months on end. It is a sappy way to start the film but that sappiness is soon discarded as soon as we are introduced to the USS Pendelton and its crew. The crew, headed by Casey Affleck's brilliant and film carrying performance as Ray Sybert, is in the midst of a terrible winter storm and they struggle to maintain control of the ship. After being battered by the brutal waves off of Nantucket, the ship is split in two and must stay afloat until help arrives. The film takes its shape during the scenes with the Pendleton and it's crew. Casey Affleck gives a good performance that remains as one of the most interesting of the film coupled with some truly gasp-worthy scenes of suspense and action. This is one thing the film has going for it, it has some truly breath taking action sequences that will leave you clawing at your arm rest and holding your breath. While an abundance of CGI is used, it still feels the way its supposed to. Cold and brutal. While the film is no match for the conditions shown in The Revenant, it still will make you shiver once or twice just looking at the weather these brave souls have to go up against. While these sequences and qualities make The Finest Hours a thoroughly watchable and enjoyable film, unfortunately the film compromises, what could be, white knuckle action and substitute it with a half-assed love story between Bernie and Miriam that borders on annoying after the first hour and equally annoying and poorly done Boston accents. The accents show Pine and Grainger as the biggest culprits. Grainger's performance as Miriam is annoying and wildly unrealistic and Pine is spineless in his rendition of, what many consider, one of the bravest men that ever served in the Coast Guard. Grainger's Miriam serves as more of a nuisance than a help to the film, which is rather disappointing because the role screams for a more able actress to take on the role and another screenwriter to make her character more than just a poorly written female character. It really throws the film for a loop, making it as lopsided as you can get. Despite this, the film moves through its main storyline with tenacity that is hard to match. One sequence in particular features the rescue crew trying to pass over the Nantucket ocean bar, a point in the ocean that features out going and incoming waves crashing against one another. The sequence is harrowing, the pacing of it is brilliant and the sheer intensity is one that the film can't seem to match for the remainder of the film. The film, while it does get your heart pounding, lacks character drama and depth. While we care about the characters, we only care about the actors playing them. If lesser known actors were in these roles, it would be clearer that the film could have used another rewrite and a stronger female character. Overall, The Finest Hours is a decent rescue film that serves its purpose of entertaining you but it does little else in the way of separating it from every other film of its type.",5,57,94,7 February 2016
The Equalizer," Washington is great even if the film itself sometimes falters
","The Equalizer teams Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington again for the first time since Training Day. While this outing is far less memorable than their first, both rise to the occasion to deliver an enjoyable action film. While the film translates the television source material with brutal and violent force, it does spend a lot of time developing Washington's Robert McCall to be a meticulous and ruthless killer with a heart and a high standard of morals. This could have been great but for the first forty minutes of the film, we're seeing a routine and as routines go, it is simple to conclude that it gets boring after the first 15 minutes. McCall meets a young prostitute named Alina, played by Chloe Grace Moretz and discovers she is beaten to a pulp and then decides to kill her employers setting off a wicked chain of gangland violence, all falling on McCall to 'equalize' the situation. As McCall is tracked by a Russian mob boss, you begin to start feeling the story drag out. This is the point where the film should really take off but it actually slows down. It tries to be suspenseful but it actually creates for a pacing mess. It jumps from following McCall to following a city of crooked cops and brutal gangsters. This would have made for an interesting dynamic for the film but the villains are so wooden and clich√® that you can't really sink into the scenes as easily as you could if Washington was on the screen. Despite this, the scenes of action really make up for the pacing problems. The action scenes are quick, brutal and never glorifies the violence. It shows it as a reality and as Fuqua's previous works show, he has a clear understanding of violence and he makes sure he shows it as a frightening event. My only problem with these scenes are not the scenes themselves, its everything leading up to it. The scenes of McCall 'analyzing' the situation he's in are cheesy and done in slow motion, it just took me right out of it. Overall, The Equalizer is a decent film that has its issues but it remains enjoyable due to Fuqua's competent direction and Washington's performance.",6,2,3,20 December 2014
Iron Man 3," Horrendous writing and storytelling bog down an otherwise satisfying action film.
","While watching this film, you will most likely get a headache at one point. This is a loud and brawny piece of cinema. Multiple shootouts, explosions and death defying Iron Man stunts make up for a lack of storytelling in an overall weak film. While the cast does the best to salvage what is left of the franchise, you can't help but wonder whether or not Shane Black took this too serious or not serious enough. Either way, it doesn't turn out a masterpiece entry in the Marvel franchise.Iron Man 3 proves to be a high octane action thriller in it's first and third act, however the second act is so muddled it is impossible to ignore. The film is what you would expect out of a summer blockbuster in the action category but fails to deliver on any story structure. Shane Black's direction gets some things right, an impeccable set of performances namely from Ben Kingsley and Robert Downey Jr keep the film from being a total washout but once the credits roll, you're left with an empty feeling in your stomach and failed expectations. While this entry is light years ahead of the second installment, it still lacks the energy of the first one. This should be expected out of a trilogy, which is why my rating isn't completely honest. By any regards, this is not a great film. The dialog is horrendous, the story structure is finicky and it is more brawn than brains. However, considering it is the last installment in the franchise, it does gain some recognition on effort. Overall, if you're expecting a summer blockbuster then look no further. Iron Man 3 is mindless, over charged and high octane. However, if you're looking for anything over and above that then skip it.",4,3,6,18 May 2013
Detroit," A Taut Yet Overlong Drama
","Detroit is the latest addition to Kathryn Bigelow's lengthy filmography and it is the most Bigelow-esque film you'd come to expect from her. The film displays raw realism with the actors looking very real and naked from their famous personas. The story is jam packed and while I think this source material would have made a much better miniseries, Bigelow makes the story work with sacrificing some facts for the sake of cinema. The big question is: is it as good as the critics say it is? The answer: No. Not Close. But with that being said, it is a damn good movie that is definitely worth seeing.Telling the story of three murdered African American men in a motel in Detroit during the city's infamous riots and civil rights movement, Detroit stars an all star cast that is certainly better on paper than they are in this film. John Boyega, Will Poulter, Jason Mitchell, Anthony Mackie, John Krasinski, and on and on-but none of them are really served as a main character. Bigelow is so determined on telling the facts of the case that she sacrifices good performances in order to give us a slice of reality. The film plays out like the most expensive reenactment of a tragedy on Investigation Discovery and, when looking at the facts of the case, this is the best compliment I can give the film. It sounds back handed but it is extremely informative even if it is picking a side in all of it. The one thing Bigelow does best is showing a true story like it is unfolding in front of you. She does it brilliantly in The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, but Detroit is where it is to a fault. With a 140-plus minute running time and a gaggle of characters to keep track of, the story is just too big for a feature film and requires patience. Despite this, Kathryn Bigelow does her best to tame Mark Boal's bloated script to a digestible film and the results are mostly good. The performances from the actors are real, raw and authentic in every aspect but never enough to burst off the screen. Bigelow lets the events unfold and do that for them. Overall, Detroit is certainly a good film in need of an audience just a very patient one.",7,69,126,31 July 2017
John Wick," The coolest action film you'll see all year
","At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.",9,629,1063,20 October 2014
Gravity," Not Since Alien has a film in space been this heart pounding
","Gravity is a heart pumping, claustrophobic scif-fi thriller from maverick director Alfonso Curan. The film's leads, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock give Oscar worthy performance as astronauts on a routine mission that quickly goes haywire. The film is enchanting in its visual effects, giving the audience a first hand view of what space is really like. The sounds are soft and drowned in space, the land vast and open, it is a truly terrifying film, as it uses extremely long takes and masterful camera work to give the audience the most realistic space experience in 3D. The scenes usually are focused on Sandra Bullock's character, Ryan Stone, giving the audience a first hand experience of what it would really be like if someone was lost in space. Bullock's performance is nuanced as she demonstrates fear and panic in the most realistic light, everything from her heavy breathing to her moments of complete hopelessness is portrayed in the most expert of ways. It is truly a fantastic performance.There are many words that can articulate the experience of Gravity, but in all actuality, it will not do this film experience justice. It is truly a fantastic film with layered characters and the best 3D work audiences have ever seen. Once it starts, you are hooked from minute one. Do yourselves a favor and pay the admission price because it is more than worth it.",9,3,5,14 October 2013
Lone Survivor," An emotional powerhouse film
","Lone Survivor depicts the failed Operation Red Wings mission in 2005 in which 18 members of the US Armed Forces were killed in action. The film delivers a heavy handed patriotic look inside what happened during those fateful hours. Right off the bat, the film starts with honoring the men and women who serve the United States in the military via a very powerful, if not, melodramatic montage. We then are introduced to Navy SEALs, Marcus, Mike, Axe, and Danny, all played brilliantly by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster. The actors in this film exude the necessary chemistry for the audience to really feel these characters as not just characters in the film, but in real life as well. From Wahlberg to Foster, all four leads play their roles very carefully and it pays off especially when we see each of them in peril. With such a connection made in the first slow building hour, we are then dropped into a forty five minute, pulse pounding shootout between a huge Taliban force and four trained Navy SEALs. As the title suggest, the shootout does not end pretty and never even comes close to sugar coating the brutal nature of war. The entire shootout sequence is filled with hard edged moments of brutality, gore and truly gut wrenching scenes. It is by far one of the most heart racing moments in recent cinema and considering the end results, it is very heart wrenching that by the end of it, you feel as if the wind has been knocked out of you. By the end of the film, Lone Survivor makes you really appreciate the freedom you have, a feat that has not yet been achieved in film up until now. This film is as good as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, it is absolutely worth seeing on the big screen and I highly recommend it.",10,127,234,9 January 2014
Fury," Fury captures the horrors of war perfectly
","Fury pits a tank filled with five American soldiers at the tail end of World War II as they struggle to fight off a small army of Nazi soldiers that are closing in on them. David Ayer directs this brutal and grim war film with no romance to it. Ayer's film is grim, bloody and unrelenting and fully captures the absolutely horrific nature of war. Brad Pitt's Wardaddy is far from Lt. Aldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds, he is a man who is truly run ragged by this war. So much so that it is all the character knows. Followed by his brigade of miserable men played by the likes of Michael Pe√±a, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal, Fury depicts not only the atrocities of war but the ideology of brotherhood with this film. Each of these actors, especially LaBeouf, give their all in roles that are merely supporting on paper. Ayer has an extremely keen eye for chemistry on screen and he directs each of these actors to deliver performances that are well beyond anything that could be scripted. These men truly feel as if they are brothers in arms and you buy into every second of it. The film on a technical level is terrific. Ayer ditches his hand held method for still shots and dolly rigs and it pays off ten fold. The film is visually stunning, a pure grit to the desaturated frame is present from start to finish. As I touched on before, Fury is a violent war film much so in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Lone Survivor. You are subjected to every bullet wound, every explosion of sharp shrapnel, every wound with the utmost visceral imagery. It is disturbing yet necessary for a film like this. Deapite these dark tones and brutality, Fury does feature lighter moments especially with Logan Lerman who gives a seemingly bare-bones performance as Norman Ellison that is subtle but extremely effective as he slowly becomes desensitized to all the violence around him. His performance is constantly evolving along with his character, letting us see layer after layer until he comes full circle in a bloody final act. The best way to describe Fury is by comparing it to Wolfgang Peterson's Das Boot just with a tank instead of a submarine. Its claustrophobic, up close and personal, making the scenes of harrowing violence even more effective. Overall, Fury is a brutal war film that shows war exactly how it should be shown. Its disturbing, its violent, its scary. Fury really hits a home run between the sweeping cinematography, the phenomenal performances and the near perfect direction, it is one hell of a film that shouldn't be missed.",9,281,548,15 October 2014
World War Z," A typical summer blockbuster, all visuals, no characters...which isn't a bad thing
","World War Z is an apocalyptic drama that lacks the same bite as The Walking Dead but packs enough of a punch to satisfy summer audiences. With it's melodramatic dialog, intense action sequences and Brad Pitt, it elevates a rather tiresome genre to new heights. While the film is absolutely stunning as an action thriller, it lacks in one of the most important elements of an apocalyptic drama...characters that the audience can relate to and sympathize with. Running at a little over an hour and half, World War Z could have easily been a three hour epic that included great characters along with its great action. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any memorable moments throughout the film. Overall, World War Z features a good performance from Brad Pitt, great action sequences, and a story in the vein of Contagion. It is highly entertaining and is definitely a recommended watch but I fear it would fail to impress with repeat viewings.",7,0,8,23 June 2013
Concussion," With a better screenplay, this really could have been something.
","Concussion tells the story of Dr. Ben Omalu and his struggle to bring to light the dangers of head trauma within the NFL. As his studies intensify, so do the attempts to silence and discredit him and those around him. The film starts with former Pittsburgh Steelers player, Mike Webster (David Morse) and his psychotic behavior that eventually leads to his untimely death at 50. When his autopsy is completed by Dr. Omalu (Will Smith), it is discovered that his days playing for the NFL may be directly responsible for his behavior. This is about as far as Concussion goes in regards to that storyline, the rest of the film goes downhill from here. The start of the film is promising, featuring David Morse as Mike Webster and giving an awesome performance under heavy prosthetics that, despite how obvious it is, gets the job done. Will Smith is a real stand out here as he should be. His performance as Ben Omalu is great and refreshing to see that Smith still has these types of performances left in him. If anything, Smith is getting better the older he gets. Alec Baldwin is another stand out here and correctly compliments Will Smith's thunderous performance. One of the disappointments of the film is Luke Wilson, not because his performance is bad or he is miscast, he's barely in it. It would have been nice to see more scenes with him. Now, the film itself is nowhere near the caliber of it's cast. Writer/Director Peter Landesman has a grasp of his actors but fails to elevate the source material above anything more than an average medical drama. The one thing that is almost overbearing is the music and the placement of the music. The score is ridiculously dramatic and epic sounding, so much so that you would think it is from a Ridley Scott action film. It just simply over the top. The pacing of the film is also a very hard thing to get passed, the beginning fires like a bullet and then the film slumps for the next hour and a half. It makes for a very lop sided, borderline boring film. Overall, Concussion demonstrates Will Smith in top form as is the rest of the cast but the film is too lop sided for it's own good.",6,8,16,22 December 2015
Don Jon," A solid comedy with a surprising amount of heart
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has knocked it out of the park with this directorial debut. Don Jon is funny, touching, raunchy and is definitely worth the price of admission. The film explores the relationship between a porn addicted ladies man and a woman that thinks he can change him for the better. Don Jon's strengths are not only in it's unique story, but in the performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an award worthy performance as the titular character, playing him not just as a Jersey Shore wannabe with shallow interests, but someone that is more than what they seem. He brings heart and charm to a character who is, in any traditional sort of sense, unlikable. Scarlett Johanssen is truly remarkable as Barbara, a beautiful and mouthy woman who looks to change Don Jon for the better in hopes that she will ride off in the sunset with him. The supporting cast, which includes the likes of Tony Danza and Julianne Moore, keep the film interesting even when the Jon and Barbara story line begins to wear a bit thin towards the third act.The biggest surprise of this film, is the cynical take on Hollywood romantic comedies. Don Jon is a film that does not follow the Hollywood archetypal romantic comedy formula, instead, it relishes in making the genre a joke, including a mock film starring Channing Tatum. Gordon- Levitt establishes his cynical nature in the trailer of the film but that is nothing compared to the fun this film has with the genre clich√©s.This is a film that will catch a lot of people by surprise, it is funny, heartfelt and very intriguing. The best way to describe this film is a funny and more audience friendly version of the brilliant 2011 Steve McQueen film, Shame. It will make you laugh, it will make you cringe but most of all, it won't make you feel that bad about spending the twelve dollar ticket.",8,16,27,26 September 2013
The Hateful Eight," The most disappointing film of 2015...
","The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's latest odyssey into his depraved and (somehow) brilliant mind. Unfortunately, those looking for a repeat performance from Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds will walk away very disappointed. The Hateful Eight is merely a three hour epic dedicated to showing just how great Robert Richardson is as a cinematographer and how full of himself Tarantino can be. It features some of the weakest Tarantino we've seen since Jackie Brown. The film starts by introducing us (slowly) to each of the titular eight, played by Kurt Russel, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins (who steals the show) and Demian Bichir. Among the eight, we're peppered with new faces to Tarantino's world along with some very familiar ones. Along with the familiar faces, we're given a familiar story, one that is closer to Reservoir Dogs with a mix of And Then There Were None... To be completely honest here, The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's worst effort as a writer and a director but it is his best film visually. The film is more of a showcase for Robert Richardson's impeccable cinematography rather than a typical showcase of Tarantino's talents. While there are some truly brilliant (yet bloated) dialog pieces, especially one from Samuel L. Jackson that is AMAZING, the film is so lopsided and uneven that it makes it hard for the audience to fully enjoy what's there to be enjoyed. For the first two hours or so, we are subjected to one bloated monologue after another then for the last hour we're subjected to a blood and bullets fest that is awesome to see but comes too late in the film to care about. The run time is where Tarantino is the most self indulging. Most of these scenes could have easily been cut down to gain a better sense of pace, but Tarantino is so confident that his material is brilliant that he just let's us bask in it. While these performances are perfection, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is absolutely brilliant in this role and deserves any award that they throw her way, the film ultimately suffers from it's best attribute...Quentin Tarantino, himself. The problem here is that this film is nowhere near interesting enough to sustain a three hour run time. The scenes of banter between the nasty eight are scenes that could have used a serious editing session. At best, the film stands as an ode to classical cinema and it succeeds in doing that. Outside of that, The Hateful Eight is a painfully slow film that could have benefited from about 30 minutes of cuts and a director that isn't so self indulging in the way he makes a film. However, at the end of the day, we're left with what we are left with. The Hateful Eight is not only the most disappointing film of 2015, it is also the most bloated. As a Tarantino fan, I was disappointed but I will say this: The Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's worst films...but even his worst film would be any other director's masterpiece so keep that in mind.",7,114,245,21 December 2015
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The Best Spider-Man Film in Quite Some Time (Maybe Even Ever)
","Spider-Man: Homecoming pits Peter Parker against The Vulture in Marvel's latest adaptation of its oldest and most recognizable hero. Directed by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey, Jr and Zendaya, the film relies on both CGI and heartfelt performances to make it work and it most certainly works way more than it doesn't. Despite some irritating comedy and an odd performance from Zendaya, Spider- Man: Homecoming is one of the better MCU films that will surely enjoy some love from fan's and audiences alike.First off, the film is a very easy and definitely the most accessible Spider-Man film. There really isn't anything new to see here regarding story. Like DC's Batman, Spider-Man's backstory is common knowledge at this point and the film doesn't waste too much time on telling it. I'm shocked that a third rendition of Spider-Man was able to be thrilling again let alone interesting. So much so that the fact that it managed to hold my attention even through the same story is a helluva feat that Watts captured beautifully. While I really liked the way this film told it's story, I wasn't so much a fan of the humor of the film.The humor used began as light but was then relied on a little too much. While we all have grown accustomed to Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark and his incredibly snarky wit, the humor was less welcomed with the supporting cast especially with Zendaya as Michelle. Michelle is a really awkward character that could have benefited from either better dialog or a better actress to land those comedic moments better. Either way, the character and performance didn't bode well with me but the audience seemed to enjoy her quite a bit. Personally, as far as humor was concerned, Jon Favreau as Happy was the source of my entertainment as he is in it a surprising amount of time and doesn't disappoint. As for the rest of the cast, all were pretty standard for a comic book film outside of Tom Holland.Tom Holland is superb as Peter Parker. He brings a light to the character that has been missing from all the previous cinematic renditions. It's pretty simple...Holland plays Parker as he is written: a teenage kid. He really does embody what it means to be Peter Parker and relishes in the performance. It's not over the top, it's played just right. And with a great hero, there's a great villain. Michael Keaton is tremendously menacing as Adrian Toomes aka Vulture. He really lays on the sinister nature of the character and the scenes that he shares with Holland are very good.Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming is probably the best rendition of the titular character that audiences have seen. Tom Holland and Michael Keaton are tremendous in the film along with much of the supporting cast. Jon Watts delivers to audiences what any up and coming director could ever hope for: a really enthralling and invigorating summer blockbuster. Homecoming is bound to go down as one of the finer installments of the MCU and one of the best blockbusters of 2017.",8,10,41,30 June 2017
Begin Again," A great soundtrack and good performances make up for the story's flaws
","Begin Again tells the story of a hapless music producer at the end of his rope and his discovery of a broken hearted indie musician who has raw talent and a bit of a mouth on her. Starring Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, Begin Again has no shortage of talent both on and off screen but the film's story is a jumbled and incoherent mess told in very jolting ways that almost seem as if they were meant to confuse the audience. Written and Directed by Once's John Carney, the film suffers from narrative flaws much like his previous film but has enough charisma to carry us through to the finish line. Begin Again has the look and feel of indie just with a big budget cast and Adam Levine doing the soundtrack. It is really well done in regards to the look and feel of the film but it has a hard time telling its story and becomes muddled in its third and final act which almost crumbles the film if it wasn't for Ruffalo and Knightley. Like I said, the performances in this film are actually really good considering it is packed full of pop stars. Levine does a fine job playing himself in this film, a pretentious musician with a voice unlike any other. Cee Lo Green makes an appearance but ultimately feels more like a plot device than an actual real character in the film. Mark Ruffalo as Dan is a blast to watch, he is a complete jerk but in a way that you can't help but love him. His fast paced way of telling it how it is between clove cigarettes and sips of a flask is nothing short of enjoyable. Carney's screenplay is an absolute jumbled mess and if it wasn't for the excellent soundtrack and montages that accompany the music, I'd probably give it a lower rating. The characters are well written, the dialog was outstanding but the overall structure of the story is poorly done. Carney has a hard time with transitions here, and his editing choices are questionable to say the least. Hard cuts in the middle of scenes, and sudden jumps in time make for a very jumbled experience that could have been saves if it was just edited with a bit more finesse. Despite this, it is still a fresh take on the musical genre and does resemble Carney's previous film Once but this film has a bit more of a lighter feel to it than that. Overall, Begin Again is a jumbled mess saved by two great performances from Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly along with an awesome soundtrack.",7,1,2,13 February 2015
Black Mass," A hot blooded gangster film about a cold blooded bastard.
","Black Mass tells the story of the infamous alliance between the Boston FBI and the city's bastard son, James 'Whitey' Bulger. In telling a story that has stained Boston and the FBI for all of eternity and telling with precision, guts and, most of all, honesty, it solidifies Black Mass as one of the best films of the year thus far. Starring an unrecognizable Johnny Depp and a scene stealing Joel Edgerton, the film blasts off on screen, making you want more and more as it play out. Just like in typical gangster fashion, there are long speeches, there is brutal violence and there is not one moment where it ever lets up. While the film itself doesn't break any new ground regarding gangster films, it is still a more than welcomed addition to the lot of them and may even become iconic but it is a bit too early to tell. Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic as Bulger. Depp brings a level of performance to the table that we haven't seen in years. He can be charming, cunning, ruthless and, at times, so cold blooded you question if this man has any humanity. For an actor to be able to pull off this kind of role, it takes a specific mind set and Johnny Depp nails it. Between scenes of him murdering anyone who threatens his empire, we see Bulger, the family man. The man that would kill for nothing being brought to his knees as he is told his son has died. There is humanity in Depp's performance as Bulger, there's just so many layers to peel back in order to get to it. I can't rave about Depp enough. The man is mind blowingly fantastic in this film and no words I can put down can justify the level of perfection he brings to this film. Joel Edgerton plays John Connolly, who ends up stealing the show in many scenes. Edgerton has become a force to be reckoned with and a pool of untapped talent that has finally been able to roar to the surface with August's The Gift (for which he wrote, directed and starred) and now with Black Mass. I sense an Oscar nomination for his work in Black Mass. He is THAT good. To be able to act opposite of Depp's career best performance and hold your own, that is saying something in and of itself. Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Julianne Nicholson, Rory Cochrane and everyone else in this cast is pitch perfect. Even Dakota Johnson is good but then again, my expectations for her was that it was going to be hard to take her seriously but she ended up delivering a fantastic performance as Lyndsay Cyr. Scott Cooper has directed some pretty fantastic films, Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace. But Black Mass is his masterpiece thus far. Cooper created a film drenched in the styles of the 70s cinema. It acts a love letter to films like The Godfather, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Mean Streets and even Serpico. Cooper's direction skyrockets what could have easily been a bomb into something very organic and very special. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic in this film, covering Boston never like a character but as a playground for Whitey. It is engrossing and engaging throughout and never overwhelming like Cooper's Out of the Furnace cinematography was. Every component to this film screams for perfection and with a director like Scott Cooper and a cast headed by an Oscar worthy Johnny Depp, the film gets just that...perfection.",6,39,79,10 September 2015
Interstellar," A visually epic film
","Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.",6,31,94,3 November 2014
American Sniper," Brutal and Powerful; American Sniper ranks among the best of the year
","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's harrowing take on Chris Kyle's life and his service in the Navy as a SEAL sniper who killed nearly 200 enemy soldiers. The film is relentlessly violent and disturbing but honors the life of the late Chris Kyle in a very admirable way. It doesn't show this man as an invincible legend, it shows him as a mere man with a heart and soul that are clearly broken due to his sacrifice for his country. Bradley Cooper delivers the best performance of his career as Chris Kyle. Cooper didn't merely bulk up for the role, he became this man without any hesitation and doesn't hit a false note. Clint Eastwood proves that he can still deliver a phenomenal film even in his mid-eighties. It isn't only impressive for his age, but American Sniper is an impressive film in general. It doesn't wallow in classic war film clich√®s, it tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the book and while some creative liberties were taken in telling the story regarding pacing, it is an excellent film. It isn't an all out war film like The Hurt Locker, it is a heavy drama with plenty of gut wrenching scenes both on and off the battle field. The most interesting part of this film is the parallels between Kyle's life as a sniper and Kyle's deteriorating life state side. It is an interesting dynamic to add to a film like this and echoes past films from the 70s such as Coming Home and The Deer Hunter. On a technical level, American Sniper sores with great cinematography that is a bit more colorful when compared to Eastwood's past films and excellent sound design. You see every wound and hear every gunshot with realistic velocity. It is a truly great cinematic experience. Overall, American Sniper is a great film that will tug at your heart strings much like last year's Lone Survivor and even goes one step beyond that film and gives us grade A entertainment with grade A acting. It stands as one of the best films of the year.",9,571,1095,19 December 2014
Southpaw," Despite a familiar plot and character, Southpaw delivers the goods by way of Jake Gyllenhaal's ferocious performance.
","Southpaw marks Antoine Fuqua's take on the boxing film genre and it is a gritty, realistic take but the grittiness and realistic approach to this kind of film has been seen countless times. Despite this fact, Fuqua manages to deliver a film that hits all the right (if not familiar) beats all while giving Jake Gyllenhaal a chance to truly act his ass off. Billy Hope is a character that throws you right back to De Niro in Raging Bull and Stallone in Rocky. The performance is just as astonishing as his physical transformation into role. He takes Hope and makes this beast of a fighter human and makes the audience feel for him with every blow he takes, both in the ring and out of it. Rachel McAdams plays Maureen Hope, who unfortunately dies by way of accidental gunfire during an out of the ring confrontation between Billy and his rival. McAdams, while he part is small, it is so crucial. Despite her screen time being limited, McAdams' presence lingers throughout the entire film, making it impossible not to root for Billy even when he delves into street violence and drug abuse. A real stand out performance outside of Gyllenhaal is Oona Laurence who plays Leila Hope, Billy's young daughter. Laurence stands toe to toe with Gyllenhaal and delivers some of the best scenes in the film with her on-screen dad. She makes you cry, she makes you laugh, it is a great performance from a young actress and solidifies herself as a heavy hitter. While the performances in this film do push it pass the clich√® scenes, there are still some underlying problems with Southpaw. The biggest is one that it can't shake and that is the plot itself. We've seen this story done many, MANY times before. Whether it is boxing or MMA, this is the same story as Rocky, Raging Bull, Warrior. A fighter fights for his family and pride. Kurt Sutter is a great writer and is grounded in reality but this is just too familiar of a plot to push this towards greatness. Fuqua, a former boxer, does a great job making this film feel like a documentary especially during the fights. They're not up close and personal like Raging Bull, they are shown like we're watching a HBO special on Ward and Gatti. It is delivered in real time but when blood is spilled and the wounds are heavy, Fuqua doesn't shy away and it makes for some truly grisly imagery. Overall, Southpaw is a powerful film thanks to its performances. However, if you're looking for a film that is a breath of fresh air, this is definitely not it.",8,5,11,15 July 2015
American Hustle," A good not great film
","With all the hype surrounding American Hustle, people are going into it expecting the next Citizen Kane and trust me, it is far from perfect. The plot is ridiculously hard to follow, but the acting is what is this film's saving grace. Forget a plot, it doesn't exist with this film. There is no clear cut storyline and anything that matriculates to something remotely close to a plot is left hanging high and dry. However, this is not a bad thing. To its credit, Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper are impeccably cast and Amy Adams shines in a career high point role. Jennifer Lawrence is wildly entertaining in this film despite being miscast in a role that was clearly geared towards a much older actress. The real star throughout this film is Jeremy Renner. His performance is being criminally underrated by critics and audiences alike, in my opinion and deserves some sort of recognition especially with a heart breaking scene between him and Bale at the end of the film.Overall, this is an entertaining and brilliantly directed film that seems to have thrown out its script in the middle of production. Either way, American Hustle is entertainingly flawed despite the ridiculous hype behind it. David O. Russell directs the hell out of every scene and chews through each frame with electrifying camera-work and brilliant acting which keeps this film from being a total wash. This is a great film but has garnered some pretty ridiculous raves from critics of all sorts where The Wolf of Wall Street (which is a better film in my opinion) has not. But, for what it's worth, check this film out, you won't be disappointed.",8,0,2,1 February 2014
Rush," A memorable cinematic experience
","Rush is one of the best films of 2013, hands down. With phenomenal storytelling, prefect direction and near flawless acting, it submerses the audience into a the F-1 Racing world circa 1976. The film showcases the bitter rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, the most memorable of the sport. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br√ºhl were near perfect in this film, due to the fact that the audience is meant to view these people as both protagonists. It delves into the morality of both characters, not showing one or the other as a villain or a hero, just regular and ordinary. With the help of Ron Howard's direction, this film elevates the intensity of this rivalry with getting riveting performances from the entire cast all around the board. However, the real shining star of this film is Daniel Br√ºhl. Br√ºhl gives the performance of his career in this film. And I fully expect an Oscar nomination for him this year.Despite being about racing, Rush's best scenes are rich in texture and performances, rather than visual effects. By far the best parts of the film were through the characters and that is what Howard intended. While the racing sequences are high octane scenes, the smaller parts are what really shine throughout the film, even if it ever gets to feel too long. Its interesting as hell and a very entertaining watch. Rush is one of the best films of 2013, delivering Oscar caliber performances along with impeccable writing and direction, it stands as a heavy handed Oscar contender.",9,4,6,28 September 2013
Nightcrawler," A razor sharp satire with Gyllenhaal in top form
","If you take the slick look of Drive and the satirical wit of Network, you get Nightcrawler. This film is a genius first film for director Dan Gilroy, it is darkly comedic, surprisingly disturbing and is brilliantly acted. The film tells the story of Lou Bloom, a freelance videographer who covers the crime world in LA for a local news station and ruthless editor played by Rene Russo. It isn't before long until Bloom's demented job overtakes his life, making him colder and colder the deeper he goes. The film plays like a twisted bloody version of Network and has the satirical wit to back it up. Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly fantastic in this film. Lou Bloom is a role that he is completely submerged in and it oozes through every frame as our dislike for Bloom intensifies throughout the film. But what this film does best is not make us particularly like Bloom but it makes us wonder what he is willing to do next. And trust me, his actions get as sick and as shocking as they come. Bloom is a depraved individual and Jake Gyllenhaal deserves a hell of a lot acknowledgment for this role because he pulls off the tricky task of making the audience care about a character that is truly unlikeable and does so with not one false note. It is truly mesmerizing to see. The supporting cast including Rene Russo and Bill Paxton are absolutely great in this film and deliver career bests here. The cinematography also is top notch here, blending the awesome pallets of Drive with a bitter cold makes for an engaging view and makes it hard for you to peel your eyes from the screen. Writer/Director Dan Gilroy is someone to watch, especially coming out of the gates with a film filled with sheer and raw velocity like this one. It is not only an impressive first film but a brilliant film all around. I highly recommend it.",10,391,471,24 October 2014
Baby Driver," The Most Surprising Film of SXSW 2017.
","Edgar Wright is known to deliver, if nothing at all, very entertaining films. Baby Driver is no exception. With an all star cast including Ansol Elgort, Jamie Foxx, Lilly James, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey, Baby Driver not only is an extremely well cast and choreographed film, it just might be the best film of Edgar Wright's career. Telling the story of a young man named Baby, who is a professional getaway driver who needs music in order to complete his jobs, as he navigates through the criminal underworld. When he takes a risky job for a mysterious gangster (played by Kevin Spacey), he finds himself on the run after things go horribly wrong. With his girl by his side and his music in his hands, Baby must use his specific skillset to get out of the underworld.Before anyone says it, yes, this film plays like a less serious Drive. The storyline is not what is supposed to stand out here, the incredible direction under Edgar Wright and the great central performance from Ansol Elgort are definitely the stand outs here. Granted, I doubt that Elgort would have been able to deliver such a great performance without the amazing supporting cast that Wright wrangles up, but he ends up giving a great performance here as Baby. The rest of the cast is more or less there for name recognition only as none of them go above and beyond in their performance. Despite this, the cast are mere pawns in Edgar Wright's brilliant film. The real stars of Baby Driver are the stunt teams. These car chases are finally something new. With the incredible automobile warfare that the Fast and Furious franchise has given us for decades, it was nice to see a film embrace a smaller scale of car chase. It is real, exhilarating and downright perfect for this film. Truthfully, the car chase sequences here are some of the best that I've seen since Refn's Drive but that's just me. Speaking of Drive, how could I forget Wright's amazing choice of soundtrack. The soundtrack is about just as great as the stunt team's work on this film. This is very much in the vein of Scott Pilgrim as far as soundtrack is concerned and is bound to be a hit come time for the film to premiere in its wide release.Overall, Edgar Wright delivers an action movie with a flawed perfection to it. The story is paper thin, the acting is passable (except for Ansol Elgort, who is terrific), but the action sequences and soundtrack are amazing. These two components are more than enough reasons to go see this film.",5,94,182,19 March 2017
Man of Steel," While it doesn't quite dazzle like Nolan's Batman trilogy, it does pack enough of a punch to satisfy
","Now, before I go off on this, I must say that I am the furthest thing from a Superman fan. Quite the contrary, I never really saw what the hype was about. However, after seeing Zack Snyder's rendition of the titular character, it definitely changed my perspective a bit. The film is a visual stunner, with action sequences that are breath taking and absolutely ingeniously shot and constructed. However, the film's true heart exists in humanizing a man that is not human at all, giving him moral dilemmas that challenge his every move. It is a tough feat to do for a seemingly invincible character but Snyder manages to pull it off quite well. Without any spoilers, there are a few touching scenes with Kevin Costner that reminds us of how great he truly he is as an actor. Henry Cavill, while he is better than the atrocious Routh, he never quite soars to the level of Christopher Reeves. Cavill's performance is good for what it is but it leaves you wondering whether or not he is just right or overacting. Now...for the best part of this film...MICHAEL SHANNON. Shannon's performance as Zod is pitch perfect. He's a villain you love to hate and he commands the screen with a villainous beat that is hard to mimic. He is the scene stealer in this film, even more so over Kevin Costner, in my opinion. Amy Adams gives a grim performance as Louis Lane and she is one of the dim parts of the film. Now, being a huge fan of Adams, I can't genuinely say that I hated her performance in this film but I can say that she has done better work and could have done way better than just playing the typical damsel in distress routine despite the character calling for just that. It just seemed that there could have been more to her performance than what was shown.Now, the story is rather easy to understand, the set up is grand and the execution is pitch perfect but the film fails to dazzle like Nolan's Batman trilogy which serves as a huge influence on this film. The dark tone is misused in this film because the source material doesn't call for it to be as dark as Snyder wanted it which creates a sense of muddled scenes. There can be comic banter but the banter that was placed throughout the film felt as though it was confused on whether or not to take itself too seriously or too light. Either way, the tonal shifts from scene to scene periodically seemed a bit jarring for me. However, Snyder does allow for much darkness to spectacle itself around for much of the final action packed half hour or so which sends the viewer off on a good note.Overall, I felt this film is the best Superman film since Donner's Superman II. It is loud, seldom dumb, action packed and, for the most part, competently made. Now, as for summer blockbusters go, this is definitely the definitive summer film of 2013 thus far so if you want a good CGI spectacle then this is the film for you. If you're expecting the next Batman Begins, try again. Overall, it is enjoyable, at times mindless and most of all, entertaining.",4,12,32,12 June 2013
The Revenant," A brutal, harrowing, and visually stunning adventure film unlike anything that's been seen before
","The Revenant is Alejandro I√±√†rritu's majestic revenge story set in the early 1800s that follows the larger than life true story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he travels across old America in hopes of exacting revenge against the men that left him gravely wounded and his son dead. The revenge story line is the oldest in the book and, no matter how overplayed, evokes the most emotion especially when the players are right. DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter make for some pretty excellent players in I√±√†rritu's more visual film and this allows audience members to connect with the film on a more accessible level rather than the cinephiles that this film was made for. Emanuel Lebezki has, yet again, outdone himself. The beauty in each frame is undeniable. The landscapes, the snow, the blood, the violence. No matter how harrowing a situation is, the film is still one of the most beautiful ever made and this is a testament to Lebezki and I√±√†rritu. The patience they endured on set speaks volumes to the film that they made. The Revenant isn't fast paced, it isn't action packed, it is a story told through the eyes of a visionary and that may off put some people who are looking for a film like The Hunted or The Grey or any other man against wilderness film. The film is slow and takes it's time in giving the audience something they can sink their teeth into. Instead, they allow the audience to be submersed in this cold and desolate landscape, all while capturing the beauty of the American landscape. The battle scenes are epic. Mostly done through extended long takes, the film is a cinephile's dream. The camera movements, the tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both physically and creatively. But as much as the filmmakers pushed themselves, so did the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance as Hugh Glass. In films before, we've seen DiCaprio fake pain. In this film, you actually feel his pain. With every bite from a bear, every broken bone being reset, every wound being crudely stitched, his performance reeks of perfection and that is exactly what we get from him here. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald is a typical bad guy here, nothing more nothing less. He's good, he's not on the level of DiCaprio here though. The rest of the cast is amazing, as always with any I√±√†rritu film. Overall, The Revenant is a brilliant film that isn't quite a masterpiece but has enough technical achievements within it to set it apart from any other film this year. I definitely recommend it.",9,15,32,21 December 2015
Split," Had the potential to be a great film but it all crashes down on a borderline idiotic twist.
","M. Night Shyamalan's Split pits a ground of teenage girls against their captor (James McAvoy) and his plethora of multiple personalities with each personality ranging from harmless to deadly. First off, I want to say, I did enjoy the first hour or so of this film. It was creepy, tense, tasteless but fun. Then the final hour comes steam rolling everything in its wake including all the thought and caring that we've grown to have over the course of the previous hour. It is not one thing or another, it's a willingness to halt the film's growth as it's own and by the final minute of the film, everyone will know what I am talking about. As for spoilers, I'm not going to spoiling anything which makes my thoughts that much harder to gather. While I'm not a complete film snob, I do expect certain things going into an M. Night Shyamalan film. If you were talking to me before The Village, I'd say that I would expect a creepy atmospheric film. If you're asking me post-Village, I'd simply say 'Dear God, I hope it's good.' The Visit was somewhat back on track for him so I was excited to see this but instead I'm leaving this film actually giving up hope. The twist is so lazy and so out-of-left- field that it diminishes any sort of weight. It is merely a gimmick rather than a clever little twist, especially for a Shyamalan film. Honestly, it single handily ruined the film for me. It is a singular moment that completely drains Split of any real merit as a standalone film.Like I said, James McAvoy gives a chilling performance that sometimes goes over-the-top but still maintains a level of creepiness without it ever being overbearing. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a very good performance as well as Casey, who gives a better performance here than in last year's terrifying yet overrated The Witch. The rest of the cast plays out the typical female horror characters to a fault and actually fails to breathe new life in a very tiring role.Overall, Split is a film that could have cut out it's so-called 'twist' and been a fun midnight movie, a solid 7/10. But instead M. Night Shyamalan delivers his laziest twist to date in hopes of continuing the trend that is a M. Night Shyamalan film. A term that used to mean something, now is played out to a gimmicky effect and we all know Shyamalan is so much better than that. And while I'm sure the 'twist' will wet some hardcore fans' appetite, it made the film that much more trivialized.",6,64,144,12 January 2017
The Shining," Ranks among the best horror films ever made
","The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's epic attempt at surreal horror and his achievement stands as not only a magnificent film but as one of the best films ever made. Starring Jack Nicholson, in what seems to be his most notable role, and Shelley DuVall, this film is the definition of creepy. The use of the tracking shots, the use of Kubrick's trademarks, everything about this film is damn near perfect. Telling the tale of Jack Torrence, an angst ridden author in need of some serious down time takes a job watching over a Colorado hotel for its off season. As the season progresses, Jack's cabin fever becomes the center point of his descent into madness. The reason this film is as scary as it is, is Kubrick's style. Without it, this would be your average run-of-the- mill haunted house story. Kubrick's intense dedication to his process along with the caliber of acting that he managed to bring to the screen time and time again, it makes for a truly unnerving and deeply disturbing look at what the fall of man looks like, mentally and physically. To read a review or anything else on this film isn't doing it justice. Like most of Kubrick's films, The Shining is a film one must experience for themselves. It is THAT good.",10,1,3,9 December 2014
Dunkirk," A Tense Film That Is Hardly the Average Summer Blockbuster
","Dunkirk marks Christopher Nolan's return to cinema and it is as bombastic as one would hope. Featuring a fractured sense of story telling, a shockingly great performance from Harry Styles and some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever witnessed, Dunkirk is without a doubt one of the most solid summer blockbusters in recent memory. Despite all that is perfect with the film, it does suffer from some glaring storytelling issues that, while many may enjoy, I found to be unnecessarily tedious.While many of you will probably hate on me for saying this, I simply have to say it: Christopher Nolan is overrated. There is no other way about it. The man has given us classics but flawed classics, at best. However, Dunkirk is a perfect response to my feelings towards Nolan. The film is extremely fast paced which is something that plagued Nolan since Batman Begins. Here, he is restrained and it pays off quite beautifully especially when you factor in the brilliance that is Hoyte Van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography. The film is big and Hoytema's determination is shown through every frame. He is dedicated to capturing beauty and here is no different. Hoytema serves as a very suitable replacement for Wally Pfister.The film, while being 106 minutes long and probably Nolan's most accessible feature to date, also is very scarce when it comes to dialog and general character development. There are very few characters here that will have you standing and cheering for. I mean, you're going to cheer at moments in the film. It is geared to do just that. But it won't have you gravitating towards Styles, Rylance, Hardy or Murphy. Quite frankly, they all have (with the exception of Styles) minimal screen time. Those looking for a Tom Hardy war movie better think again. This isn't about one soldier, it is about all of the soldiers. No one is more important than the other. Overall, Dunkirk is an exceptional addition to Nolan's impressive filmography. Crafting a unique war film that doesn't rely on overtly patriotic moments to move it forward is hard yet Nolan makes it seem effortless. The film relies on the courage and sheer will power of the human soul and that is something only the rarest of war films can do. Despite some wonky story telling, Dunkirk is nonetheless exhilarating and should absolutely be seen on the big screen.",8,47,96,17 July 2017
Jackie," Natalie Portman is terrific as Jackie Kennedy even if the film never catches up to her genius.
","Jackie tells the story of former First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, as she struggles to cope with the assassination of her husband, John F. Kennedy. While many people are concerned with the magic bullet theory, Jackie is concerned with the life of the woman behind the 35th President of the United States after she endures having to watch her husband die in that now infamous car ride in Dallas. There is no room for macho-ism here. This film is a singular burst of estrogen on screen as we follow Portman's Jackie navigate through the days after her husband's death. This isn't a film in which a woman discovers herself through a man. This is a film about a strong woman put in a near impossible situation and how she coped with that impossible situation to become exactly what she was known to most of the world as: the strongest woman alive.First off, this film is a brilliant character study. Running at a brisk 96 minutes, the film is relentless in showing every facet of Jackie's life both before and after the assassination. Natalie Portman is astounding as the titular character. She plays Mrs. Kennedy with such honesty and tenacity that it is almost impossible to look away. This is a performance for the ages and definitely Portman's best performance since her Oscar winning performance in Black Swan. While the film features an amazing performance from Portman and the rest of the cast, including an impressive turn from Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy along with Billy Crudup and Greta Gerwig, it fails to captivate the audience past the phenomenal performances.The film, despite being a brisk 96 minutes, doesn't allow for anything other than the performances to speak. The cinematography, while very nice and well done, doesn't really work like it should. It never feels as grand or as sweeping as it should for such an amazing subject matter. It hits the familiar beats of a character study and walks to the tune of a standard biopic. But no matter how familiar this film ends up feeling, for every standard point to it, there's an extraordinary performance to off set it.Overall, Jackie is a film that was made for heavy hitting actors that can give breathtaking performances and our cast doesn't disappoint even if the film sometimes does. It hits every familiar beat that the biopic formula has created over the years. While this may sound like a negative, it does fit this film and does wonders for Natalie Portman's searing and commanding performance.",7,3,11,3 December 2016
Non-Stop," Turn your brain off and enjoy the ride
","Non-Stop pits Liam Neeson in yet another race against time, fight for your life drama and it pays off. This is just the type of film you'd expect to see in Feburary/March. It is fun, light and action packed. Liam Neeson plays a down on his luck ex-cop turned Air Marshall who is framed by terrorist and sets out to clear his name all while on a flight in mid-air, over the Atlantic Ocean. The film really does an excellent job of showing us just enough to raise suspicions for just about every character on the plane, including Neeson's character. This is a wild ride of a film and it comes as a real surprise considering this time of the year is dumping grounds for studios. Neeson, still bolstering off of the success of the Taken series and other films such as The Grey, really doesn't let his fan base down here. He plays a mean, surly, cigarette smoking badass and he does so with enough charisma that we don't really mind seeing him do the same thing over and over again. A nice addition to Neeson's performance is Julianne Moore. Moore isn't Oscar-caliber here (obviously) but she does just enough to keep the film going. The rest of the cast has typical action movie one liners that are corny and cheesy but for a film like this, it works beautifully. The story progresses as a Hitchcock film with a Luc Besson-esque twist, utilizing its one area setting to create some massive tension in every scene. Overall, this is a fun movie that you can watch and just enjoy thoroughly. Do yourself a favor and give this one a shot.",8,1,6,1 March 2014
Foxcatcher," A harrowing and disturbing character study with excellent performances
","Foxcatcher tells the fateful story of John Du Pont and the Olympic winning Schultz brothers. Directed by Bennett Miller, Foxcatcher taps into the psychology behind Du Pont, examining his psyche in the most disturbing of fashions. Steve Carrel delivers a performance that many will find hard to swallow. He is dry, he is awkward, and he is completely insane. To keep it simple, Steve Carrel is absolutely terrific and truly shows his range as an actor. It is an amazing performance that is bound for Oscar glory. The other half to Carrel's Du Pont is Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz. Tatum completely drowns into his character, leading him to turn in a vicious, unapologetic performance that is so perfectly executed that you will soon forget that this is Channing Tatum. When he is on screen, he is Mark Schultz. It is the best performance that Tatum has given in his career and stands to grab a possible Best Suppoting Actor nod at this year's Oscars. The voice of reason for both Mark and Du Pont lies in Dave Schultz, played brilliantly by Mark Ruffalo. Dave serves as this mediator in between Mark and Du Pont especially when their relationship starts becoming more and more intense and violent. The rest of the cast featuring Vannessa Redgrave and Anthony Michael Hall also turn in very sound and great performances as well. As far as acting is concerned, Foxcatcher is a hard film to beat. Every actor is on top of their game here and it really shows how good of a director Bennet Miller is. He takes a seemingly dry script and turns it into an emotional roller-coaster by way of his actors. One scene in particular haunted me involving a simple glare from Tatum's Mark Schultz as he peddles faster and harder upon seeing Du Pont. That scene on paper isn't that interesting but with Miller's uncanny ability to make even the simplest scenes intricate and layered, it works and remains one of the more memorable scenes from the film. The other highlight from this film has to be the cinematography. Everything is filmed with a slight tint of dread and gray, it creates the mood immediately and balances the story perfectly. Overall, Foxcatcher is a great character study featuring top notch performances that push this film into the top ten of the year easily.",10,84,145,4 November 2014
It Follows," A tense and unique horror film.
","It Follows tells the story of a a sexual encounter gone bad. While this whole premise feels familiar in one way or another, director David Robert Mitchell manages to inject enough originality and genuinely disturbing images into this scary and tense horror film that is bound for cult glory. The film follows (no pun intended) Jay, an all American girl from the Detroit suburbs who dreams of meeting 'the one' and having a summer love. As one would expect, it soon turns into a hellish nightmare that ends with a looming, potentially deadly force lurking behind every corner of her life. The film takes twists and turns throughout the way, but the best part about this film is the sense of dread in every scene. It weighs down as heavy as bricks until some truly disturbing visuals make this film go from dreadful and suspense filled to absolutely horrifying. The suspense builds and builds with this film and when it finally releases the tensions with a scare, it becomes almost unbearable to look at the screen without your hands in front of your face. The performances in this film, outside Maika Monroe, are pretty flat. This surprisingly doesn't really affect the film as bad as you would think. There's enough of a good performance coming from Monroe to carry this film to the finish line and then some. My only gripe with this film is that it is really ten minutes too long and feels as though it starts dragging in the second act. These scenes that slow it down are not necessarily bad or poorly done, it just feels as though Mitchell could have maybe left a bit more on the cutting room floor. In retrospect, this is a minimal problem. This is a horror film that is scary and truly unique. In an industry that produces crap films with cheap scares, it is very refreshing to see one that actually takes the genre seriously and delivers some serious scares. It is definitely worth watching and I highly recommend it.",4,114,227,11 March 2015
Gone Girl," If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.
","Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",10,429,772,1 October 2014
Get Out," While the film does boast some talent, the film itself wallows in self importance.
","Let me start off by saying this: Get Out is far from a bad film. It is genuinely frightening at times and, dare I say, even genius at some moments. But the film's biggest problem is that it knows it is a step above other horror films and it reeks of self importance. When you take into consideration the political climate in America, Get Out is a film that is hitting at a right time. It is tackling white liberal racism in the upper middle class and it does a very good job at making its point. However, as the film goes on and the scares become more frequent, the film starts feeling cheesy and overwritten even if the performances are truly stunning.Director Jordan Peele makes the most out of his cast. Daniel Kaluuya gives a truly magnificent performance as Chris while Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are utterly horrifying as the Armitages. However, Allison Williams is a weak link and is very dry in her delivery which makes her performance comes off as wooden. She is the weak link and it isn't hard to figure it out especially in her scenes with Kaluuya. The story progresses and Williams' performance is slowly twiddled down which then leaves the glaring issue of the script. While the characters in this film are really layered and relate-able, the story they are in is so overwritten and self indulgent that it is hard to consider this the horror gem many critics and audiences are calling it.The idea of a great horror film is to thrill and scare while making a social commentary. We look back on such films as Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Friday the 13th (maybe), Halloween...these films have weight to them and you don't know it until it's over. With Get Out, we know this is a film with political undertones, we know it wants us to think this is something more than a horror film. In some regards it is, but in most it is just a horror film that thinks it is more important than it actually is. This takes from what Peele is trying to achieve with directing a horror film. Everything comes off being very tongue-in- cheek instead of being straight horrifying and that is probably the most disappointing factor with Get Out. Instead of sinking these political undertones in the writing, Peele makes them abundantly clear and it ends up taking away from a film that is, otherwise, pretty good.Get Out is a step above your average horror film and features some pretty amazing performances. Despite this, the film suffers from a very weak script that will feel as if you're being hit over the head with political banter rather than having the sh*t scared out of you. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in Get Out but the film does feature some awesome performances and some genuine scares that will be enough to make you wish the film was better.",7,37,93,23 February 2017
Drive," One of the best films of the decade
","Nicolas Winding Refn's hyper stylized vision, Ryan Gosling's darkly timid hero, Newton Thomas Sigel's flawless cinematography, these are the key components to Drive that make it one of the best films of the decade. Drive tells the story of a mysterious and nameless hero who is embroiled with the underbelly of the LA mob all while falling in love with his neighbor. In a nut shell, this is two films in one. The first half of the film focuses on Driver's relationship with Irene (Carey Mulligan) while the second half is a livewire crime thriller that never lets up. The beauty about this is Refn strikes the perfect balance between telling the love story and telling the real story, this setting up motive after motive in a grand finale that is unforgettable. There isn't a 'strongest' player here, everyone involved, both the actors and the crew, are at the top of their game. Some of which have yet to achieve this level of greatness even four years later. Ryan Gosling delivers a performance likened to De Niro's Travis Bickle. He is quiet and timid but taking one look at him, you can tell that there is a rage building up in him. Gosling does an amazing job in this role and its hard to take your eyes off the screen with a performance like that. The supporting roles are equally colorful, Ron Perlman, Albert Brookes, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston and Oscar Issac are all magnificent here. An especially excellent turn by Albert Brookes makes him one of the most memorable villains in a crime film. Bernie Rose is evil, manipulative and psychotic but Brookes plays him with a certain sense of entitlement that makes it hard for you too look at him for too long because you're that afraid of what he might do next. Refn plays with silence much like Stanley Kubrick and some scenes even feature a Kubrick-ian feel to it all, it is engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable. Overall, Drive is a modern masterpiece that is beautifully shot, excellently acted and an all around amazing film.",10,1,2,13 February 2015
The Theory of Everything," Redmayne and Jones are excellent in this heartbreaking love story.
","The Theory of Everything tells the uphill struggle that world renowned genius Stephen Hawking went through when dealing with his, now, infamous disease and trying to maintain his relationship with his loving wife, Jane. The strengths of this film rely solely on Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. These two actors are absolutely, one hundred percent, PHENOMENAL in these two roles. Stephen Hawking is the role that Redmayne was born to play. Hawking is portrayed as a charming and intellectually superior individual that behaves just like any one else. After a bit, we start to wonder what was every so amazing about him...then the heartbreak starts. Jane Hawking is a sweet, loving and determined person that will go to the lengths of the universe to make sure her husband, Stephen can survive. I get chills just thinking about certain scenes, some of which will most definitely be requiring a large box of Kleenex. The truth is, anything that I say here about these performances, no matter what it is, is still criminally underselling the sheer brilliance of them. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are simply incredible and I'd be even willing to go to the extreme to say that both actors will not only be nominated, but I'd be surprised if they didn't win the Oscar gold. Now, with that being said, this film's structural issues are severely hampering this film's chances at being a classic. I wasn't completely sold on the structural integrity of the film. It showed enough of the relationship aspect behind Stephen and Jane but it very briefly touched base on Hawking's intellectual discoveries and I thought that if it was a bit more balanced in that respect, it would be a near perfect film. One plot point that I did find utterly enthralling is the idea that Hawking struggles throughout the film to do simple things. These scenes are, by far, the most heart wrenching scenes to watch. James Marsh directs his actors effortlessly and can evoke the type of emotional response out of his audience through them, but when left with telling a story, Marsh falters. Marsh, known for 2012 IRA drama, Shadow Dancer proves that he is an actor's director. He cares about human drama over anything in a tangible sense, which benefits this film greatly but also harms it in the way of progression. Despite these minor infractions, The Theory of Everything is a film that everyone can enjoy and turns into a real audience movie. It is a film that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next, no easy feat for any film, and this one does it effortlessly.",7,96,123,11 November 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Watch the 34 trailers they have out and you've seen it already.
","The Amazing Spider Man 2 is something that falls short of its predecessor, and hits every branch on the way down. The action is loud, the acting is obnoxious, and the overall story is so jumbled and fractured that it is hard to keep track of what is going on. Andrew Garfield delivers a solid performance as Peter Parker while Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx and even the great Paul Giamatti fall flat...right on their faces. Marc Webb confidently directs his action but leaves the actual story and character development for the sidelines. While it is far from the most important thing a Spider Man movie should have, it would have been nice to have a coherent storyline to adhere too. The technical aspects of the film are somewhat mediocre, the CGI effects often look cheesy (ie. Jamie Foxx as Electro), the editing is very choppy and jumbled. This makes for a frustrating watch to say the least. I would say the biggest problem I had with this film was Dane DeHaan. DeHaan is a gifted and talented individual...but this film makes him look like a soap actor. Marc Webb seemingly fails to direct him as Harry Osborne with any confidence or competence, either or, it remains as the most disappointing and frustrating aspects of this film. Overall, the kids are going to enjoy this one, which isn't saying too much. Between the dozens of trailers they released online, when you walk out of Amazing Spider Man 2, you'll see every beat coming from a mile away. If you have kids, they will love this film and be thoroughly entertained...if you have a brain, you might want to switch it off when watching this and try your hardest to enjoy it because I know I didn't.",5,8,17,2 May 2014
Hidden Figures," A film so concerned with being a political statement that it forgets to be a good film.
","Hidden Figures tells the story of three African American women in the late sixties as they become instrumental to NASA in putting John Glen on the moon. Directed by Theodore Melfi and stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner and Kirstin Dunst, Hidden Figures would be a good film had it not been so concerned with the idea of the empowerment of women that it forgot to be a good, engaging film. It has the proper ingredients to become a heavy hitter but trades it in using its excellent cast as more of a political statement than anything else.The film starts off by introducing us to Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson (Henson, Spencer and Janelle Mo√†ne) in almost the exact same ways. We see that Katherine is a number cruncher and a brilliant woman all around...then the exact same character traits are rehashed for Spencer and Mo√†ne's characters. There is nothing different between the women, there are 3 of the same character in one film. The only difference between the three is Taraji P. Henson's excellent performance that makes her thoroughly enjoyable throughout a film that would have been a direct-to-digital film otherwise. The film does very little to give any development to these women and keeps drowning us in the notion that 'this is girl power.' It became extremely redundant after awhile and left me waiting for the film to get serious but it never did. This is a film that is more about what the characters did rather than how and why they did it.Overall, Hidden Figures is a bland film with paper thin characters that tries to make more of a political statement rather than make a good film. This is a perfect example of political climate affecting creative endeavors. If there were anything I could say it is: if you're going to see the film, see it for no other reason than Taraji P. Henson's excellent performance. Taking her out of this film in any way, shape or form would have probably stopped this film in the development process but then again, maybe that is where this should have stayed.",2,262,533,29 December 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun, campy and wildly entertaining. One of the best Marvel films to date.
","Guardians of the Galaxy plays out like Star Wars on crack, its fast, ferocious and a badass entertaining thrill ride throughout. Following a rag tag group of intergalactic criminals, Guardians has the plot line of a Star Wars film, the characters of a Dirty Harry film and the action of every Marvel movie combined. What makes this film stand out from the rest of the Marvel films is that it engages you knowing that you have absolutely no idea who or what the hell this is. It does a great job filling you in with information from the comic and it makes for an enjoyable watch. Unlike the fans of the comic, I had no knowledge of Guardians of the Galaxy and walking out of it, it really educates you on anything you may have missed out on all while giving proper character growth and development without heavily relying on the comic books as 'common knowledge'. Chris Pratt is awesome in this film, he reminds me a lot of Indiana Jones in space. He's a wise cracking, ass kicking criminal that can beat with his words or his fists (more times than not, its his fists). Dave Batista, Zoe Saldana, Michael Rooker, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper along with Pratt gives Guardians of the Galaxy a better cast than Avengers. The film comes at you like a bullet train thats about to derail, you're always engaged with these characters despite most of them being an alien, a talking tree or a talking raccoon. The film is really amazing in that you look at these characters and the ridiculousness of the situation and still don't even question it. Now there are some plot holes that will more than likely be cleared up the Marvel way, meaning down the line something will happen to patch up a couple holes here and there. While that may prove to be lazy writing, I think Marvel films have now earned the right to do whatever the hell they want. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great comic book film and this is coming from someone who was so apprehensive about seeing this film that I almost didn't go. This is a surprising, entertaining, gut busting thrill ride that is impossible to disappoint especially to fans of the Marvel universe and franchises. But even if a superhero movie isn't your thing, I'm confident enough to say that you'll have a great time seeing this movie. It is that good.",9,6,16,30 July 2014
The Imitation Game," Cumberbatch is terrific but the film itself is a jumbled piece of storytelling
","Alan Turning, the man, the legend...he single handedly built the world's first computer and helped win WWII for the Allies due to his discoveries only to be sought out as a spy when in reality the only double life he was leading was that of a homosexual. The Imitation Game chronicles his discovery and his ultimate medical torture as British Parliament tries to 'rid him' of his homosexuality. This is a heart wrenching biopic that really is a mere showcase of how good Benedict Cumberbatch is as an actor. Despite this very talented showcase, The Imitation Game achieves very little during its two hour runtime other than letting us know, sometimes a bit too heavily, that Cumberbatch is an amazing actor. Working from Graham Moore's impeccable BlackList script, Morten Tyldum tries to make this film more of an espionage thriller but it couldn't be further from that. The Imitation Game is a character study and straight biopic that falls into the well treaded clich√©s that make up the genre. The story is slow moving, and extremely jumbled as it jumps from 1951 to 1939 a little too often, making it very hard to end up caring about each storyline in their own rights. While I commend Tyldum's work here with his actors, he misses the mark in telling this engaging story. Instead, he throws most of the load on Cumberbatch. Any other actor would have probably crumbled under such pressure but Cumberbatch rises to not only give the performance of his career but the performance of a decade. Cumberbatch as Turning isn't very likable, but he is articulate, shy and extremely intelligent and Cumberbatch uses that to his advantage. His performance as Turning is somber, articulate and intelligent, much like the man he is portraying. It is a marvelous performance that makes the film worth watching based solely on that. The supporting cast is decent here, Kiera Knightley is very good in this film as she plays Joan Clarke, a woman that tries desperately to get close to Turning throughout the course of the 1939 storyline. Other actors include Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong. Each of them are decent in their roles but pale in comparison to Cumberbatch. Overall, while The Imitation Game may have one of the best performances of the year in it, it doesn't make up for its jumbled narrative.",6,2,7,22 January 2015
Prisoners," Brilliant Performance on top of masterful film making, the best film of 2013 thus far
","At first glance, this film will strike many people as a typical Hollywood revenge film resembling the likes of Death Wish and Payback. However, that is furthest from the truth. Prisoners packs one hell of a punch, giving the audience not only something very entertaining, but also something very human in the process. The film plays out more like Seven, Zodiac and Mystic River, allowing the audience inside the mind of Keller Dover, a man searching for his daughter while teetering on the brink of insanity. The story kicks off when the Dover and Birch families are celebrating Thanksgiving. What seems like a normative celebration quickly descends into a frantic search for two young girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal)arrives at the Dover house after the abduction and soon finds a suspect in Paul Dano's character. But as time passes without finding the girls, Dano is finally let go. Much to his dismay, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the suspect, subjecting him to brutal torturous methods as he searches for the truth in finding his daughter. What makes Prisoners so well crafted is the performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, both of whom are at the top of their game in this film. The chemistry between these two actors is impeccable, bringing a natural presence to the screen. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Melissa Leo, is superb. Viola David, Maria Bello and Paul Dano also give caliber performances, and keep the film entertaining just on their performances alone.The story keeps moving and moving and never slows up despite a two and a half hour running time. While that seems like a deterrent nowadays for most audiences, this film is good enough for anyone to sit through happily and be able to walk out of the theater satisfied with the final product. This is a heavy hitting movie that Hollywood very seldom makes. It is rooted in classic revenge films from the golden age of Hollywood while introducing new style and substance, making for a truly intriguing watch.If there's any film that you should see right now, trust me, it is most definitely Prisoners.",10,7,15,20 September 2013
Logan," If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.
","The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.",10,426,733,23 February 2017
Selma," A good MLK biopic that could have been great.
","Selma tells the story of Martin Luther King as he organizes the infamous marches during the height of the civil rights movement. To be fair, Selma is a good film. It isn't a great film, but it is good. David Oyelowo gives a great performance as MLK despite feeling like a bit of a miscast but it isn't enough to sustain interest in his character, which is shameful considering the great and brilliant man that he is portraying. All in all, Oyelowo doesn't pack the punch that we all want to see out of a MLK based film. At 122 minutes, this film wallows in cheap drama surrounded by some serious heavyweight performances, it creates an uneven balance between what is great and what is mediocre. Actor Tim Roth does great work here in portraying the ruthless and racist George Wallace. Roth delivers an evil performance that will turn your stomach with every syllable that spews out of his mouth. Roth does a great, outstanding job in making you hate him and I definitely give him high praise in this film. Another stand out performance is Carmen Ejogo, who portrays Coretta Scott King with such honesty and velocity that she's hard to ignore. Ejogo's performance is one that I continuously am thinking about even as I'm writing this. The supporting cast is huge in this film, featuring Tom Wilkinson, Cuba Gooding Jr, Giovanni Ribisi, Common and Oprah Winfrey. But just because the star power is here, doesn't mean they're all good. Honestly, the supporting cast outside of Tim Roth and Common are mediocre at best. Oprah Winfrey delivers a performance that we've seen multiple times over the course of her acting career. It is nothing new, especially because it feels she is just rehashing the same performance from last year's The Butler or from the much superior The Color Purple. Winfrey serves as more of a distraction than anything else. Common is awesome in this film in a small but crucial role to what Oyelowo's King wants to achieve. Common proved before that he can act, but here, he proves that he isn't just another rapper turned actor, he really delivers force to this film with blunt and swift justice. The screenplay here is Selma's downfall. Written by first time screenwriter, Paul Webb, it really feels like Webb's first rodeo, making classic first time mistakes between cheesy dialog and long drawn out scenes that, in retrospect, serve little purpose to the film as a whole. Despite these issues with the screenplay, it was in the most capable hands possible for this film...Ava DuVernay. While there are major pacing issues with the film, DuVernay directs this with a determined efficiency that oozes out of every second of the film. While this can't save Selma from falling casualty to a lot of clich√© scenes and cheesy dialog, she does make up for all of what's wrong with the film with a handful of great performances and awesome cinematography. Overall, Selma is nowhere near the Oscar contender that I wanted it to be nor is it the biopic that a man as great as Martin Luther King, Jr deserves but Selma is a decent film that reminds me more of Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X' or Lee Daniels' 'The Butler' rather than last year's instant classic '12 Years a Slave'. It's a good movie, nothing more, nothing less.",4,149,241,9 December 2014
La La Land," An Exercise in Classical Hollywood Filmmaking
","La La Land, the wildly beloved Oscar frontrunner, is just as mystifying as critics and audiences said it was. The sweeping cinematography, the perfect, strategically placed lighting, the performances, the dance numbers...it all makes La La Land exactly what people were NOT expecting out of 21st century musical. This is a mystifying burst of classical Hollywood filmmaking. To that effect, there is nothing new rather just a new voice to an old dialog. Directed by Damien Chazzelle, La La Land is an analytical odyssey of the price of fame as told through the eyes of two big dreamers, an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) and a struggling Jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) as they coast through life in Los Angeles. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are fantastic in this film. Emma Stone gives a career best performance and seems to be riding the same prestigious wave she caught with 2014's Birdman. Gosling is equally great but we've come to expect this type of performance from him. The charismatic dreamer with a golden tongue fits Gosling a little too well at this point even if he does it better than any other working actor in Hollywood. While the film is well acted and the choreography in the dance numbers are mesmerizing, La La Land is still a hard film to recommend to anyone not already gung ho for musicalsDespite being toted as the best film of the year, La La Land is exceptionally underwritten. Trading great storytelling for grand musical numbers that are expertly planned and executed, Damien Chazzelle knows the film's strengths and weaknesses. While he plays off of the film's strengths in an expert fashion, he does very little to cover up the film's number one weakness: its script. However, despite this being a weakness, Chazzelle does a wonderful job at making us forget the problems and sinks us into enjoying the film for what its worth.Overall, La La Land is most certainly an ambitious yet flawed musical from Damien Chazzelle which proves that Whiplash was far from a fluke. Featuring a career best performance from Emma Stone and brilliant camera work along with excellent choreography in its musical numbers, La La Land is a film that will most certainly leave you feeling satisfied even if it doesn't hold the lasting power of Whiplash.",2,1,6,3 December 2016
Snowden," A cold and rather banal addition to Oliver Stone's filmography.
","Snowden tells the story we already know so much about and yet, the film treats it as if we know nothing. Oliver Stone's latest political protest of a film results in a ridiculously boring and rather banal addition to his once colorful but now lackluster filmography. The film starts by introducing exactly who Edward Snowden really is. He is a solider, a genius, and someone who, very much so, cares about his country. He is eventually hired by the NSA and the rest is history. First off, the film does nothing for Snowden other than paint him as more a patriot than anything. All personal opinions of the man aside, I'm strictly judging the character in the film. Even then, this film paints him as more a patriot than Clint Eastwood did for Chris Kyle. It becomes ham-fisted in its delivery and ends up really making for a cold film especially after what happens to him. Rather than going into what makes this film the way it is, I'll put it very simply: the film is not very good. The film is not good as a biopic and it is even worse as a political thriller. What starts off as possibly giving us, at the very least, an entertaining neo-political thriller it quickly turns into an assault on the US government. Again, I'm far from willing to interject a personal opinion in this but my opinion on the film is that it feels as though Oliver Stone wanted to make an anti-political propaganda film that is dressed up like a thriller. That is exactly what you will get when seeing this film. It does nothing in the way of expanding dramatically on the far superior CitizenFour and it does nothing to keep you engaged as the runtime slowly ticks by, giving nothing to the audience in the way of the audacious film that we deserve on such a hot button subject matter such as Edward Snowden. Now, with that being said, there is some good in the film. The performances here I found to be quite solid. Shailene Woodley gives a very good performance as Lindsay Mills, Edward Snowden's curious and worrisome girlfriend. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a fine performance as Snowden but more so nails down his voice rather than his look and mannerisms, both of which came off as parody- esque to me. The supporting cast is filled to the brim here, starring Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Rhys Ifans and Nicholas Cage to name a few. Each of the supporting cast members give their best with what they're dealt with. Cage is also a very good (and very brief) side actor that almost steals the film, not because he is particularly ground breaking in the film but because it is Nicholas Cage. If anything, it felt distracting but I didn't mind with all things considering. By the time the film ended, it left me with nothing more than the feeling of being watched. It won't let you feel the drama or the weight of it all, it will leave you beaten down in the worst way because it feels like the equivalent of two people having a heated political debate in ear shot of you and all you want to do is tell them to 'shut the f- up'. Overall, Snowden is a lop-sided political thriller wearing its agenda on its sleeve, reeking of the very idea that Oliver Stone never had the best interests of the film at heart. If you are a hardcore fan of Oliver Stone or if you have never seen Citizenfour then Snowden might be a safe bet for you, otherwise, this is merely a rental at best.",4,29,77,14 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," When All is Said and Done, Everyone Deserves a Better Film Than This.
","The highly anticipated release of the live action remake of Beauty and the Beast had all the ingredients of a future classic. With the animated film approaching it's 25th anniversary, the hunger for something like this is unfathomable. Yet, when the lights go on and the credits roll, I was left feeling like I was swindled. The Bill Condon film looks and sounds beautiful but the film is very thin in live action form. Emma Watson is woefully underselling as Belle and Dan Stevens does the best he can under the CGI-laden Beast. There are many issues with the film at the heart of it but one thing sticks out like a sore thumb: the complete and utter lack of originality.The film does nothing in the way of introducing anything new to the age old story. The film is literally almost a shot for shot remake of the animated film. While die hard Beauty and the Beast fans along with their kids will probably enjoy the film, those looking for an extra layer will leave sorely disappointed. Despite this, the film does offer some explosive moments of action that are extremely well choreographed along with Josh Gad's wonderful performance as the comic relief that, despite his performance being marred with controversy, ends up being one of the stand-outs of the group. Then there are the musical numbers and these renditions are just as magical as it was in the 1992 animated film. They're infectious little numbers that are bound to be hummed for days after seeing the film. Despite these very positive attributes, the film just misses the mark and never rises to be more than just another remake.Overall, I was very disappointed by Beauty and The Beast. I thought Bill Condon's best work is left to be desired, the two leads are very much so miscast, and the film offers nothing new in the way of a remake. However, if these things don't bother you, it is still a good family movie that can entertain for a solid 2 hours but will do very little outside of that. Is it worth going to see in the theater? No but if you have kids, chances are you're going to be dragged to it anyway so just try and enjoy it for what it's worth.",5,98,199,16 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," It doesn't deliver like it should but that doesn't mean you won't have fun.
","Guardians of the Galaxy was a surprise hit in 2014. No one expected the film to do the business it did, especially me. However, the film delivered on every single thing you would want out of a summer blockbuster. It had heart, action, comedy, thrills and the right slice of drama to make it a little better than your average summer film. Now, fast forward 3 years and we've got its much anticipated sequel. Many fans will absolutely love this film and rightfully so. James Gunn has done a great job with these two films and it will definitely be enjoyed even if it is half the measure of the first film.First off, the movie is good. It is light, funny and definitely digestible. There is not one moment where you find yourself lost or wondering what is going on. That is a definite plus for a sequel. Sure, having a handle on the source material or, at least the first film, will help but it isn't really needed. Considering there has been a plethora of Marvel Universe films since Guardians of the Galaxy, not needing to brush up on some plot points is a good thing. While I could easily go into a 10 page essay on this film and its quirks and why it works, I am giving a short, sweet spoiler free review here. So, in short, the film itself is a decent sequel to a great movie.The cast returns and delivers even more banter and jeering at each other than the first film which adds to the characters. Chris Pratt and the voice work of Bradley Cooper really tie this film's characters together. Supporting cast members such as newbie to the series, Kurt Russell or seasoned alumni Michael Rooker, all deliver with Rooker giving a career best performance here. The man is so good in this film, you forget which side he's on. It's not that you love to hate him. It's that you can't wait to see what he does next. The film's strong point is its cast and James Gunn knows it. He uses it to his complete advantage. We care about these characters, no matter how other worldly they end up being. That is a true testament to James Gunn as a director. He really does an amazing job both as a filmmaker and screenwriter. But, no matter how good of a job he does, the film is a bit of a mess at times.Now for the problems it has...there are quite a few. The biggest issue facing this film is that it is too similar to the first. There isn't enough to distinguish it from the original and that is a bad thing at times. It doesn't allow for the freshness and inventiveness that the first one had and that was where a lot of its magic happened. Truthfully, the only way to distinguish both films apart are the soundtracks. While both soundtracks are awesome, they're both different in a lot of ways. From Blue Suede to Fleetwood Mac, that's the big difference musically...but visually, it's more of the same. That's probably the biggest and only complaint that I have with this film. As much as I like seeing these guys and gals kick some otherworldly ass, I still wish there was just a little bit more to it than what we got.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a complete rehashing of the first film with a new character here and there and a revamped soundtrack. While many will be happy with the end product, those of you who are wanting something fresh and new will have to holster those expectations. The film is definitely a crowd pleaser and will go over quite well with audiences and fans. At the end of the day, I think that is all James Gunn and Co could dream of getting.",7,0,4,4 May 2017
American Made," American Made is conventional Hollywood biopic filmmaking
","American Made tells the story of Barry Seal, the pilot who transported drugs for Pablo Escobar from Columbia to the States. Seal was a crafty, good looking guy with a golden tongue that allowed him to operate as freely as he did. But just as crafty as Seal was, he was a daredevil. While Seal's life story is surely interesting enough to sustain a film, American Made is merely tipping the hat at conventional filmmaking and never really tries to do anything different to distinguish it from other crime films. And being directed by Doug Liman makes it feel like that much more of a missed opportunity.American Made, while being conventional, is also very watchable. Tom Cruise brings everything Tom Cruise to the role where it is hard to distinguish whether Barry Seal was actually like this or if Tom Cruise thinks he is still playing Ethan Hunt. For me, I didn't see anything distinguishable from Cruise other than a half baked accent. This is especially frustrating because Tom Cruise can act and he can act better than most working actors. The problem is, his film choices have limited him to one liners and bombastic stunts. Not that I don't appreciate his work, I simply don't appreciate it in this film because it feels like Cruise is just getting by. I think he was an absolute miscast. The rest of the cast does well but we barely see them enough to make an opinion of them as we are with Seal for the majority of the movie which becomes exhausting.Overall, American Made is a very conventional crime drama that makes sense for Hollywood to make. Unfortunately, those looking for a dark and gritty telling of Seal's life will be sorely disappointed as the film is the definition of conventional and plays rather light despite its dark ending. Tom Cruise makes the best out of his role and makes sure that he has more fun than anyone else...including its audience. American Made is a taxing film that relies on the star power of Tom Cruise rather than relying on the heft of its true story to carry it.",4,10,27,11 September 2017
Jersey Boys," Melodramatic, gloomy and moody, Jersey Boys disappoints
","Jersey Boys tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons as they shot from neighborhood kids to super stars with perfect voices. This a been there, done that affair that rarely catches your attention. Outside some very well acted scenes with Christopher Walken and classic Eastwood framing, Jersey Boys is nothing more than a failed musical adaptation for the big screen. To start, the actors all come from the stage and carry that style of acting to the big screen. Everything is bright and bold in their performances, and the film's cinematography paints a rather dull and dreary sense of reality. The cinematography, while fitting for a thriller of some sorts, its wildly out of place here. That heavy white lighting, foggy filters, that dreadful sensibility we saw in Hereafter and J. Edgar are all carried over into Jersey Boys? It doesn't fit, not in the very least. As far as this being a Clint Eastwood directed picture, it is surprising considering this is just plain and simple, not a good film. Eastwood can definitely direct, we've seen proof of this as he has delivered some instant classics our way...however, Jersey Boys is one of his lesser films. Quite frankly, if this is one of his lesser films, that's okay because this film is far from a train wreck. There are things to like here, some humor sprinkled about and some decent drama keep this from being a total wash up but overall, is this the film everyone wanted it to be? Not by a long shot. The film feels long and under cooked and never really goes to where Dreamgirls or Rent took us. Jersey Boys is not a great film, it is barely even decent but if you are a fan of the Broadway musical, you may let it slide.",5,6,27,23 June 2014
Whiplash," JK Simmons is the ONLY reason to see this
","Whiplash chronicles a jazz drummer's tumultuous relationship with a volatile instructor. While this is well acted and shot beautifully, Whiplash fails to catapult itself to greatness with bogging down its story with rather wooden supporting characters and a slow as molasses storyline. Whiplash tells the story of Andrew, a jazz drummer coming into a cutthroat art school and his instructor, Terrence Fletcher, an off the wall and emotionally abusive instructor. The strengths of Whiplash lie solely in the hands of J.K. Simmons. Simmons delivers a tour de force performance, turning a fiery rage into something inspiring for our lead, Miles Teller. Simmons has some truly great scenes, spouting off profanity laced rants when trying to bring out the best in Andrew. The scenes with Simmons send the film into overdrive, making you want to know what happens next. However, this feeling of excellence on screen quickly turns into boredom as we see Miles Teller try to captivate us the same way his co-star did and falters. At the end of it all, this comes down to talent. J.K. Simmons sets a high bar for his co-stars, and this actually ends up hurting the film because of his performance. Miles Teller seems as if he can't keep up in scenes with Simmons and rather than captivating us with his relentless drumming until his blood hits the sweat filled drum kit, it actually ends up feeling as if he is trying too hard to top his co-star in regards to intensity. This creates for an uneven film, one that never truly becomes the masterpiece it wants to be. Despite these lesser qualities, Whiplash does feature some truly great scenes of Simmons berating his students with some of the best delivered insults this side of Full Metal Jacket. Damien Chazelle does showcase his talents, lingering on the physical and emotional tolls that the environment takes on Andrew and other students. Despite this quality, Chazelle fails to connect his characters to his audience. But one thing that won't be lost in translation is where these characters are and how competitive it is. Quite honestly, I feel this worked better as a short film. There is simply not enough for audiences to latch on to or enough for them to care about. But one thing is for sure, J.K. Simmons is ON FIRE in this film and delivers one of the best performances of his career.",8,9,24,5 October 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Goodfellas meets Wall Street, its one helluva ride.
","To say The Wolf of Wall Street isn't the best Scorsese film would be accurate, it doesn't even crack the man's top five films. But, with that being said, Scorsese is THAT good that saying this isn't his best film just means it is the best of the year and not of the decade. This film is insightful, poignant, and downright hysterical from start to finish. It leans more towards Scorsese's comedy genre, much in the vein of After Hours with a little smidgen of Goodfellas and Casino added to intensify the film high you get when you watch this. The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring film with energy to spare and performance to marvel at. Martin Scorsese directs yet another unforgettable performance from DiCaprio and gives Jonah Hill a high point in his career. Between all the Quaalude, cocaine, and hookers, there is a Greek tragedy playing out before our eyes. Belfort goes from being the top broker/criminal at his firm to being a drug fueled, yuppie with high minded ambitions that always seem to have a funny and hysterical way of falling through. The film is a chronicle of his rise and fall and clocking in at 3 hours, you barely feel it. The film is so energetic in telling this story that it is hard to look the other way even when we are exposed to characters smoking crack, popping Quaalude like Skittles and snorting more cocaine than Tony Montana along with banging every hooker north of Manhattan. This film is pure entertainment and worth seeing in the theater. Go and see this film, you won't be disappointed.",7,5,14,30 December 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Sweeping cinematography mixed with brilliant performances makes Birdman one of the very best of the year.
","Birdman is a brilliant, mind blowing experience that is filled with grand performances, Hitchcock-esque camera movements and a brilliant way of storytelling. Above all, Birdman's all star cast featuring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zach Galifinakis propel this film to greatness, telling the story of a has been actor, Riggan, who was once known for a comic book franchise from yesteryear as he struggles to regain the stardom he once had through an off Broadway play. This proves to be harder and harder for Riggan as he deals with the disappointments of his own life while dealing with the difficulties of making this play his ticket back to stardom. This film serves as a somewhat personal film to Michael Keaton, giving the mere fact that he was known for playing Batman, a comic book hero eerily similar to Birdman. Keaton is an actor that proved time and time again that he can play virtually anything from heavy and hard hitting dramatic roles to silly and funny comedic roles as well. In Birdman, he strikes a perfect balance between the two and turns in the best performance of his entire career. He is firing on all cylinders and truly rises to perfection especially in scenes with an equally great Edward Norton. Another highlight of Birdman is the cinematography. First off, WOW. This film has some of the best cinematography I have seen in quite some time. Focusing on extremely long and spiraling takes, it submerses you in the scene, giving you the type of voyeuristic experience that Birdman calls for. We very much follow these actors as if we're watching a documentary on LSD. The camera movements are slow and bouncy, the tracking shots are nothing short of amazing and it gives an overall, dream like experience when watching this film, something that really benefits the film towards the latter half of it. I fully expect the film's Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki to score a Best Cinematography nomination come Oscar time. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given us some new age classic films such as Babel, Biutiful, and 21 Grams. Birdman is no exception and, to be honest, this very well may be his masterpiece. He directs his actors with grace and never lets them miss a beat and with some extreme long takes throughout the film, it shows just how good of a director he is and just how good his actors can be, especially Michael Keaton. Overall, I could go on and on about this film and just how great it is but nothing of what I say here can really do Birdman justice. It is a film that you need to experience for yourself. With that being said, Birdman features amazing performances including a jaw dropping turn from Michael Keaton, along with some of the best cinematography I've seen in years. If there is one film to see during the Awards season, it is Birdman.",10,125,249,16 October 2014
The Big Short," The acting is brilliant, the dialog is snappy, and the characters are rich but the story is far too intricate for a film.
","The Big Short is comedic director's Adam McKay's attempt at drama and it is somewhat bittersweet to see. On one hand, the performances that McKay is able to obtain from his actors is that of an optimum level however, despite the performances and how excellent they all are, the story is far too involved and convoluted to fit a feature length narrative. This would have been a much better television mini-series, and may benefit from a less surreal approach to the source material. The film starts by showing us Ryan Gosling donning an expensive black suit along with equally black hair and dark brown eyes, a strikingly different look than the blue eyed heartthrob we're all used to seeing. He introduces himself as Jared Vennett, an eccentric businessman that discovers from a long line of real estate geniuses and brokers (Steve Carrell, Brad Pitt and Christian Bale, among others) that the infrastructure of the entire US economy is bound to collapse. And unfortunately, any American knows what came after that. A total economic disaster of epic proportions that crippled a nation and forced mortgage foreclosure signs on the front lawns of millions of homes and countless ruined lives. The film handles this subject matter quite gracefully but moves way too briskly through the material for anyone to get an understanding of how it all works but, then again, there are college courses on this exact type of economy and there are many that still don't have an understanding of it all and they work in the field. The issues that The Big Short suffer from is a less interesting script that sacrifices what could be some really riveting documentary work for some mock-Wolf of Wall Street moments and Gosling waiting for his Jordan Belfort or Gordon Gekko moment, one that never comes close to even arising. Steve Carrell and Christian Bale give exceptionally strong performances in the film. Carrell plays a broker who struggles with the loss of someone close to him while discovering the financial fallout of America while Bale plays Micharl Burry, the man who discovered the fatal flaw in America's system. Overall, Thr Big Short tries to pack in too much information into a feature film narrative and is weighed down by some truly slow moving and confusing back and forths that essentially amount to the characters playfully hurling insults at one another. While these scenes are well acted and very engrossing, it leaves much to be wanted. The actors are excellent and Adam McKay has done a wonderful job at directing them to some career best performances. McKay's mistake lies in a jammed pack script that is in dire need of some breathing room.",7,2,6,4 January 2016
Wonder Woman," This is One Surprisingly Good Movie
","Wonder Woman is the latest film in the (up until now) failed DCEU and it seriously kicks some ass. With the 2016 arrivals of Batman V Superman and the atrocious Suicide Squad, expectations were tempered with this film and rightfully so. Batman V Superman may have redeemed itself with a self-indulgent but much needed director's cut and Suicide Squad...well, yeah-that just was terrible so any pessimistic antics regarding this film are sort of justified given the track record thus far. Well, I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is one seriously cool film. Directed by Patty Jenkins and also stars Chris Pine, Danny Huston and Robin Wright, Wonder Woman is the DCEU's Marvel equivalent to Thor and it is just as good, if not, better. First off, the film is very informative even to a layman. It doesn't treat things as common knowledge but it doesn't hold your hand either. This is a smart movie when it comes down to it because it doesn't rush anything. Everything in the film flows naturally, it doesn't feel like these characters are boring or that the story is not engaging. The pacing is very well set and for a film that is pushing 150 minutes, that's impressive. The acting is also surprisingly great. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman is probably the most perfect casting in cinema history. Gadot is fierce, brave and absolutely stunning in her portrayal. It reminded me a lot of Christopher Reeve when he was Superman. The supporting cast lead by Chris Pine is also great. Pine is proving himself to be one great actor. With last year's Hell or High Water and now this, Pine is slowly proving what it means to be a movie star. Another stand out in the film is Danny Huston who seems to relish in villainous roles. Huston is really great here and I'm hoping he gets the credit he deserves. While there is much to praise with this film, there is also so issues I had with it as well. Many people were actually comparing this film to The Dark Knight at my screening. As much as I did like this film, I am also here to say: No. Not even close.The issues I had with the film were more so directed in the way of the script. While I thought the pacing was great in the film, I thought some of the dialog was horrendous and cheesy. The film does escape and shed some of the very things that landed DC in hot water but it also can't seem to escape one very damaging part of DC: bad dialog. While I am sure that many people are not going to care about a misplaced line or two in between Wonder Woman kicking butt and taking names during trench warfare, it does become a bit of distraction during the less exciting moments. The moments between Pine and Gadot are very melodramatic and feel more like a soap opera at times. Many people will like it, I personally thought the cheeky stuff was more so thrown into the film rather than feeling natural.Overall, Wonder Woman is a great addition to the superhero genre. It has heart, it is lighter than other DC films but also has the edge it needed to be a cut above the rest. Fans of Wonder Woman comics should be pleased and tickled pink by this lovely film adaptation and those of you who were skeptical can breathe a sigh if relief because this movie is definitely worth the price of admission.",7,11,33,30 May 2017
Straight Outta Compton," If nothing else, Straight Outta Compton is entertaining to say the least.
","Straight Outta Compton tells the the story of the most influential group in hip-hop and rap, that group being N.W.A or as Eazy-E so gracefully puts it N****s With Attitudes. Directed by F. Gary Gray, Straight Outta Compton is, without a doubt, his best work behind the camera. However, by traditional standards, that isn't saying much. Gray is no stranger to N.W.A, Ice Cube or Dr. Dre having directed numerous music videos featuring their music. While the film is a very nice 'fairy tale' telling of a story filled with tension, violence and rage, it lacks the balls to tell the actual story. Instead, the film picks and chooses what to tell and what to leave out, very strategically as well considering the film is two and a half hours plus. Starting with the streets of Compton, we are introduced to each character with a bang. Each of them getting their own introduction as if they were folk heroes or something, whether it is petty crime or writing rap lyrics, the film shows these characters with a sense of heroism to them no matter what they're doing. The best performance out of the group would have to be Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre. Hawkins delivers in every scene he's in, making it a true standout performance among actors that sometimes feel like they're in over their heads, more specifically Jason Mitchell, who plays Eazy-E. Mitchell feels more like a caricature of the late rapper rather than an actual actor portraying a real life counterpart. The film moves quickly enough and focuses long and hard on all of the partying, the women, the guns and the drugs, so much so that you start to wonder whether the film is a N.W.A music video tribute. Despite the falsehoods, the glorification and the shaky performances, Straight Outta Compton works well as an entertaining film. The only downside of this film is its haphazard statement on Police Brutality. While that is as prevalent as a topic can get for a film from 2015 about N.W.A, that was not the highlight of the group. The highlight of the group was the fight against the censors. A fight that they won, obviously. Despite that truth, the film wallows in trying to be a message about police brutality rather than a film about these men, their flaws and their triumphs, their ups and their downs. Unfortunately, it leaves us knowing nothing new about these people and at two and a half hours, we should leave this film knowing every little detail about them. Instead, we're left wanting more out of them. Overall, Straight Outta Compton ends up being an entertaining film about some of America's favorite rap artists instead of an important one.",8,32,81,13 August 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," While Johnson and Dorman light up the screen, but the film falters behind the scenes.
","50 Shades of Grey has now reached classic status among women who marvel over this book and while I don't quite get why, I respect the hell out of EL James and applaud her for her ability to make something so daring and racy. However, now that it has now jumped from the page to the screen it has something to it that keeps you watching but ultimately leaves you befuddled about what it is truly about. Objectification, vanity, feminism, masochistic sexual urges, these are all themes this film plays with but just can't seem to pinpoint an exact one it wants to stick with. The screenplay for this is a muddled piece of writing that lazily skates through its near two hour runtime with looks from Grey to Ana and no real dialog that is clever or even remotely interesting. The performances in this film are what keeps you watching. Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson are electrifying as Christian Grey and Ana, the two of them definitely took their jobs seriously here both physically and mentally and it absolutely pays off as much as it can considering the script they were working with. There's not a false note with their portrayals here but it does seem hard to judge when so much of the film relies on glares and one word answers. While Kelly Marcel tries to make the fans happy, it ends up hurting the film's chances of actually being good because there's just so much to say here regarding the characters and she ends up not saying anything, leaving us craving more of a connection with the characters that just simply wasn't done very well. One thing that is focused on more so than anything else are the sex scenes. They're intense, realistic and very personal and they remain the highlight of the film considering we learn the most about the characters when they're having an orgasm. There's only so much you can put into a movie especially if the source material is as sordid as this but Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't disappoint when showing you the savage sexual nature of the infamous Christian Grey. These sex scenes push the boundaries of its R rating and fans of the book should be happy to hear that they can finally visualize some of the titillating details James seems to love to describe in her book. Despite the sex scenes being very well done and carefully filmed, the rest of the scenes feel lacking. Dorman and Johnson are screaming for a better script, its a real shame that Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel are seemingly asleep behind the wheel. Overall, 50 Shades of Grey is very well done in its look and feel but beneath the surface of it all, there isn't much going on outside its sex scenes.",4,102,201,10 February 2015
The Wolverine," The Wolverine adaptation that fans deserve
","The Wolverine gives us more reason to take X-Men films more seriously. First Class restored our faith while this one solidifies it as a serious force of filmmaking brilliance. Under the direction of James Mangold, this marks the best X-Men film since X2 and vastly superior to the terrible X-Men Origins. The Wolverine pits our anti-hero against 21st century samurai in Japan while discovering the limitations of his mutant curse. This film is an absolute blast from start to finish. Mangold takes what Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn laid out and turns it into his own, thus creating a whole other level to be reached for the next X-Men film. The film is paced awesomely and the story is very engaging, something that has somewhat plagued X-Men films from X2 on. This film fixes the wrongs and despite some plot holes here and there, this film is wildly entertaining. The action sequences are brutal, how Wolverine was meant to be seen. One thing Mangold does here is push the envelope. For a PG-13 film, this as close to an R rating as you can get. Wolverine was always meant to be seen as a savage character and as far as an on screen savage is concerned, this film does it right and isn't afraid to shy away from a bit of blood. The tone here is a lot darker than the originals, it is not meant to glorify anything here. We view Wolverine's world as he does, bleak, cold and brutal. Overall, The Wolverine is a fun, smart, action packed thriller that doesn't let up until the end credits roll. If you liked the other X-Men films, you'll absolutely LOVE this film.",9,7,14,21 June 2014
Mother!," An Extreme Dose of Lynch and Kubrick come with Aronofsky's Very Pretentious Mother!
","Mother! tells the story of a young woman and her older husband as they move into their dream home in the countryside. One night, an older couple shows up at their door and all hell breaks loose from there on out. Now, Darren Aronofsky has been a personal favorite since Requiem for a Dream. His sense of style and perfection to his craft always resonated in his films. The hiccup of Noah was understandable but this film is a film that just should have been better. While I did love a lot about this film, there was almost an equal amount that I didn't. First off, I loved the sense of dread the film gives off. It is less interested in giving the audience jump scares rather than making the story and images linger in your mind like a bad dream. I loved Aronofsky's visual style here especially in his set design. The house is a character in and of itself (not to sound totally redundant). I also loved the cinematography. Much like Black Swan, this is a very sweeping spectacle of camera work that is intoxicating. As intoxicating as the technical aspects of the film are, the actual story, script, acting and overall pacing leave much to be desired.Mother! is most certainly a film that plays with your mind but I wouldn't necessarily call this a psychological thriller. This film is a horror film that the minds of Kubrick and Lynch would bring you, not Aronofsky. The script is bare minimum, the story is paper thin and the acting is wooden and overall plain. There are no stand out performances like there was in Black Swan, The Wrestler and even Noah. It falls flat and that really takes you out of the film. Javier Bardem is another very strange casting choice. You'd think he would knock this performance out of the park but it really was quite opposite here. Truthfully, the actors don't seem like they're interested in the work until the final 15 minutes of the film and by that time, I had about given up.Overall, Mother! is a very strange film that Aronofsky had seemed to not put that much thought into. While I do plan on watching it a second time to get the full effect of it because the last 20 minutes or so is a real mindf*** that is bound to throw everyone for a loop and/or anger a lot of people. Either way, this one is bound to be a divisive one among cinema lovers and Aronofsky fans as I doubt many average movie goers will take to this.",6,38,84,10 September 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Pure entertainment, but lacks any emotional punch
","When the original Thor was released back in 2010, it had everything, gutsy action sequences, humor, heart, you name it, it had it. Thor was a thoroughly enjoyable comic book adaptation. Now, Thor: The Dark World has just been released and while it maintains some awesome action sequences and some humor to keep it going, it does lack some of the emotion that made its predecessor so good. Not by any means is Thor: The Dark World a bad film, quite the contrary, it is a very well made film and features some of the coolest action sequences we've seen in 2013. However, this sequel seems to dwell on the coattails of the original and never seems to fully stand on its own two legs. Featuring one awesome performance from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the rest of actors seem to fall beneath him and end up being lackluster compared to him. Chris Hemsworth does what he can with the role but there isn't too much more that he could do with the character of Thor that he didn't do in the original, so therefore, I can't fully put him at fault. The rest of the cast ends up being an afterthought when the end credits roll. The biggest failure of Thor: The Dark World is that it tries to best the original by adding more action and less story (something that sequels are infamous for). Now, while the action sequences are undeniably cool and entertaining, there isn't much more to it. The threat doesn't feel real in this outing and that brings the film down from where it could have been. With that being said, the bright side is that the action sequences are so well done and Hiddleston is outstanding as Loki, I can't fully disregard this film. As for the holiday season coming along, Thor: The Dark World is an awesome outing to take the family to. Other than that, it is pure eye candy and there isn't anything wrong with that.",4,0,3,18 November 2013
Lucy," What starts off with promise quickly descends into a generic action film.
","Luc Besson has been a filmmaker that has consistently delivered some of the best action films of all time. From Leon to The Fifth Element, Besson has solidified himself as an action auteur. However, Lucy stands as a perfect example of seeing a legend overshadowed by a long and lengthy career. Lucy stars Scarelett Johansson as the titular character, a normal woman who is injected with a super drug. Before the film really gets going, we don't spend enough time with Lucy as what she would normally be. Before we know it, Lucy is soon injected with a mysterious serum that is some sort of super drug that is simply a more amped up version of the Limitless pill and then we slowly stop caring about her character because she is everything short of invincible at this point. Lucy's premise offers a lot of promise but its execution is something completely different. The action sequences are bland, played out and down right ridiculous. Usually that's a good thing for a film of this type, but what makes Lucy the exception is the terrible editing and poorly written plot. For the first 40 minutes of the film, you're engaged in the film. The story takes off immediately, starting with a voice-over from Johansson that proves to be pointless and useless by the end of its brisk 90 minute runtime. This is half a good film, half a really incoherent mess of a film. Johansson's attempt at being a brutal bad-ass collapses right around the time Lucy starts to access more than 50% of her brain. While her performance is commendable and she gets an A for effort, I simply don't buy it. Morgan Freeman plays virtually the same character here as he did in Transcendence and, much like that film, it gets tiresome after seeing it a couple times. The film descends into one pointless twist after another until you finally are asking yourself 'what the hell is going on?' There are some great scenes of action that seem very carefully choreographed in the beginning along with a car chase sequence that was pretty awesome as well. Despite these two good qualities, it isn't anywhere near enough to save Lucy from poorly written dialog, terrible plot twists and an overall lack of coherence.",4,10,27,25 July 2014
Unbroken," A slight disappointment
","Unbroken tells the life story of Louis Zamperini, former Olympian turned World War II POW and does so with some grace but ultimately falls victim to its own hype. Angelina Jolie directs this brutal and inspirational story of Zamperini and his struggle to survive in a Japanese POW camp after he is shot down over the Pacific and presumed dead. This story is so inspirational, it will bring tears to your eyes especially with the charisma and precision that Jack O'Connell brings to the role. The issue here is the screenplay. The film focuses so much on the brutality that Zamperini faced that it is hard to remember any other scenes outside of the torture that this man endured. Zamperini is portrayed as a determined, defiant force, challenging his captors at any chance he can. It is mesmerizing to think that this man overcame so many odds and survived so much and we had to wait this long for a film about his life. It is a truly amazing story that deserved a better screenplay that doesn't wallow in strictly the brutality that this man faced. Jolie proves that she can direct her actors and she does this brilliantly. O'Connell is a star in the making, starring in this year's prison drama Starred Up and now with Unbroken, he is an actor with a rage inside of him and he is destined for greatness especially after seeing this film. His performance ranks among the best of the year. The supporting cast includes Garrett Hedlund, Domhnail Gleeson, Jai Courtney and the magnificent Miyavi, each of them deliver fantastic performances. Garrett Hedlund as John Fitzgerald is a huge leap for the supporting actor and proves that he can rise to the occasion to shine. The screenplay written by the brilliant Coen Brothers is a surprising misfire as I said before. It stays on the brutality of the POW camp and struggles to move around POW movie clich√®s and it doesn't always work especially throughout its two hour plus running time. By the end of the second act, Unbroken loses its steam and becomes somewhat of a talk fest that doesn't mount up to anything remotely thought provoking. Roger Deakins, a frequent Coen brothers collaborator also turns in some lackluster cinematography that, in comparison to his other work, is bottom of the barrel and by the book. It looks more like a Clint Eastwood film with its monochrome look and doesn't do the film justice. Jolie does her best with a script that could have easily had more of a punch but she makes it work and turns in a decent film filled with great performances. Overall, it is a bit disappointing due to the hype that was behind it but, above all else, Jack O'Connell's performance is the perfect way to honor this brave, tough and brilliant man known as Louis Zamperini.",6,17,37,2 December 2014
The Purge," Exactly what it was marketed as
","From the start, The Purge grabs your attention with a complete rundown of what the future of America is like. Crime is down, the economy is great aka the complete opposite of Anerica today. Then the film introduces The Stantin family, a picture perfect wealthy family preparing for the annual Purge. The film goes into high gear after the youngest Stantin child let's in a man trying to escape the violence outside which ultimately brings the violence inside once his killers start looking for him. The film goes into high gear from here on out. Overall, the film is acted just as it should be, nothing special but nothing horrible. The scenes of chaotic mayhem are down very well with the violence quick and brutal. However, the film starts to lag at the end finishing with an ending that leaves more questions than answers. This is a clear cut example of an awesome idea that could have been an excellent movie sold out by the standard Hollywood clich√©s beset upon every film nowadays which makes it just barely memorable. It won't win any awards but it will win your attention for the full 85 minute runtime leaving really nothing to talk about after except for a dumb ending to an otherwise disciplined action thriller. Overall, I recommend this film just as it is, pure escapist entertainment.",6,0,0,10 June 2013
Life," Brutally Brilliant
","Life tells the story of a crew of astronauts as they discover a new life form on Mars. As the crew begins to examine the new life form, it begins to take each crew member out, one by one. As the life form makes its way through the group, the space team begins to turn on themselves in hopes of survival. The film, directed by Daniel Espinosa, is a heart pounding sci-fi film much in the vein of Ridley Scott's Alien. While many sci-fi films since Alien have been rightly compared to it, Life is a sci-fi film that knows its inspirations and directly alters the perception of its viewers. When you think the film will take a right, it takes a hard, very surprising and very swift left. This keeps you on your toes and never lets you relax at all which is the best compliment I could give this film. Starring an all star cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, and Rebecca Ferguson, the film's cast adds to the surprising nature of the story. The moments that end up being the biggest in the film come from the surprising lengths these characters will go in order to survive. This makes for a very layered and very interesting take on something that could have easily been a CGI spectacle with no heart and very little brain. The decisions that these characters make are real decisions. The weight of someone's choice echoes and reverberates throughout the entire film. Espinosa has done a very good job at keeping his characters grounded in reality, much like the film. While this may turn some viewers off, especially those who are expecting something like Gravity or Interstellar, it really made the film something else for me. It was a sci-fi film that was completely unafraid of being real and ho-hum at times.Overall, Life is an excellent example of going against the typical sci-fi genre tropes and features some truly brilliant performances from the main cast. While many may be expecting something like the sci-fi films that Hollywood has been churning out over the past couple years, this film is far from the normative sci-fi film. This film feels more in line with films like Ridley Scott's Alien and Tarkovsky's Solaris which makes this rise above the rest of the films it will be compared to. Along with being Espinosa's best work, it also features a very human performance from Ryan Reynolds that was just as surprising as the film itself.",8,158,303,19 March 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Kick-ass, entertaining and relentless throughout. This is what every sequel should aspire to be.
","John Wick Chapter 2 pits Keanu Reeves' titular character against the mean and nefarious of the criminal underworld. Once again, Reeves proves that he is a force to be reckoned with in this ridiculous, over-the-top sequel that is every bit as fun as the original. These types of films are rarely known for their artistic value but John Wick: Chapter 2 sets the bar pretty high, not only in its action, but in it's set design and camera work. This is pure escapist entertainment and couldn't have come at a better time. Those wanting to take a break from watching the Oscar nominees, this film is exactly what you're looking for.The look and feel of the film is very much in line with the first. It is nice, vibrant colors that compliment the violence and chaos. The sound is absolutely amazing with each gun sounding the way they should instead of using the stock machine gun or pistol sound which is something the original was guilty of at times. The performances are awesome, even if Common is rehashing his Run All Night character even down to his wardrobe. And the direction of the action sequences is beyond impressive. This is a bigger John Wick and one that does a nice job at expanding on this guy's world. It really becomes a pulpy and interesting world that I'm sure we'll all enjoy a third time around. The only issue that the film may have depends on your taste in action films. This is considerably longer than the original (almost by 20 minutes) but it moves so fluidly and so frenetic that it barely feels like it. Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is one hell of a sequel. It has everything a sequel should have and definitely doesn't disappoint. If you loved the first one then you're probably going to love this one. It is a straight up, balls to the wall thrill ride that is more than worth the price of admission.",5,219,417,9 February 2017
Joy," Joy proves that both Jennifer Lawrence and David O. Russell have lost their touch.
","Joy tells the story of a strong willed woman or, as our narrator concludes, the film is about all strong women everywhere. We are introduced to Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) as she plays outside her father Rudy's (Robert De Niro) auto shop store. We get glimpses of dysfunction within her family and then it spits us out somewhere between one surrealist scene in which Joy dreams about soap opera stars and her family harassing her and then it goes into her family life and why she is in the situation she's in. This patterns continues throughout the whole film, allowing us to never feel an ounce of concern over Joy and her miraculous mop. Why care about someone who can literally figure a way out of every unsavory situation she is in and into every beneficial situation she's in. There's no suspense, no wonder, no enchantment. This film feels like a biopic but ends up coming across as a half assed attempt at one as it blends the corniness of soap operas into the seriousness of David O. Russell as a filmmaker. In the end, it never works. Not even once as a film. Instead, the film subjects us to situations that Joy is in that we care nothing about. Whether it is mending things with her mother and father or fending off those looking for a free ride, you know before it even starts that Joy is going to get out of it. This makes for a painfully boring film. The performances are good here, as with any David O. Russell film (except this year's Accidental Love). Jennifer Lawrence is being Jennifer Lawrence. There's no acting required here for her. She can sleep walk through a strong willed woman role and she does so here. Despite being the lead role, Lawrence is the weakest link here. She was the weakest part of American Hustle and she is the weakest part here and it is a testament to Russell continuously casting her in roles that should be played by actresses ten years her senior. American Hustle it was pretty clear she was out of her element, there's no difference with Joy. She wallows in a mature aurora to her but it never really rings true no matter how hard Lawrence tries (and trust me, she does give her all here). It ends up being a good performance in a woefully miscast film. The supporting actors are plentiful, some even stealing whole scenes. One highlight here is Robert De Niro. Russell has proved he can get the absolute best out of De Niro. This is refreshing to see especially because we all thought he gave up with some of his recent film choices but De Niro can surprise us with touching performances in between playing cookie cutter gangsters and cops. Bradley Cooper is good here and will make you want more out of him but this is a showcase for Jennifer Lawrence so let your hopes down easy. Overall, Joy demonstrates that David O. Russell has a confident handle on his performers but it also proves that he is merely a carbon copy of Martin Scorsese (or at least he is trying to be). It is an uneven film that is inspired by Goodfellas in the way Joy's story is told and unfortunately for this film, gangsters are much more interesting than housewives making a fancy mop...no matter how kick ass that mop may be in real life, the film feels like a rip off in more ways than one.",4,43,94,27 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A film that is as courageous as its subject and as violent as the war it portrays.
","Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield's Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she'll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone's parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson's excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does.",9,233,370,13 September 2016
13 Hours," A hard, rough-around-the-edges war film that is straight forward and to the point.
","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi stands as Michael Bay's best film since The Rock and proves that Bay, despite lately delving into this, is maturing as a filmmaker. Many people are torn on the Transformers franchise. If you ask a 12 year old boy, Transformers is the best series ever but if you ask someone over the age of 18, they would probably rather see something a little more indulgent. 13 Hours is for the adult moviegoer. It is violent, rough, bloody and very adult in its approach to a still restless political situation even three years later. Bay has no interest in going out of his way to tarnish anyone's reputation here...the events speak for themselves. The story follows a group of contracted government employees who engaged in a firefight between Libyan militia for 13 hours trying to defend a secret US station in Benghazi. We are all well aware of Hilary Clinton and her hand in this situation, Bay knows that so he doesn't even waste actor's breaths on the situation. He decides to let the action speak for itself, literally and figuratively. The film is beautifully captured, it features signature Michael Bay shots, music video esque color grading, which do become repetitive after awhile, but are done in a tasteful manner. Coming from a script penned by Chuck Hogan (The Town; Argo), it is so drenched with the American hoorah type of soldier characters that those Bay-esque angles compliment the film and the telling of it quite well. These were men that didn't really get enough credit for their heroics so anything Bay can do to immortalize them, he is hell bent on doing. The acting is that of your average Michael Bay film, screaming, gunfire, big buff guys working out, it is all the same without the objectifying of women. This film Bay trades his objective vision of women to men, which is a bit comforting to know that he isn't all that sexist after all. Starring John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, and Toby Stephens, the cast does its best between gunfights to establish some character development that doesn't go much further than establishing these men as family men and as soldiers. There's barely character development to grasp here thanks to an ill advised first act that tries to give the audience background on what led to the attack on the embassy in Libya. However, despite the tension filled yet useless first act, the second and third act are blistering with brutal and bloody shootouts, excellent camera work and explosions that put you in the middle of the action. This is a different Michael Bay shoot 'em up, this is one that makes you feel inside the action rather than a spectator of it. Overall, if you can put politics aside, I recommend this film. Yes, this is catering more towards the right than the left but that doesn't make it any less of a good film. 13 Hours stands as Michael Bays finest work in a very VERY long time. Hopefully he can continue this trend of smaller more adult films.",8,3,13,18 January 2016
