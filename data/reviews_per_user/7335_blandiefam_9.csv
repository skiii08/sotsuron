Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Better Than the Trailers
",I must say that this movie was not what I expected. It delivered more than what anyone in the theater thought it would. I was surprised that some folks walked out in the middle of it. This drama with vampires was interestingly contrived between truth and fiction. The story of the vamps was creatively interwoven with the events of Lincoln's brief life. I loved the way the story stressed other important parts of his tenure as our 16th president and the inclusion of real named figures and fictitious ones made you feel as if the vampires were an unwritten part of our country's unique history. The actor playing Lincoln even resembled him and Liam Neeson. The acting was great and the story telling pulled you into a place where you felt as if his life could really have been this spectacular. The special effects were up there with other bigger advertised movies and the fight scenes reminded me of Sin City and Sherlock Holmes. I think this movie is worth watching only if you don't expect a teenager vampire romantic Gothic romp. I am guessing the ones who left expected more sex and something more in the line of recent romanticized vamp movies.,8,5,10,26 June 2012
The Expendables," Good Movie If It's Your Style; Botox Commercial
","I liked the movie for what I should like this kind of movie. Guns, explosions, fights, one liners, and old heroes. It was a shame to see all of the Botox used on many of the actors trying to regain their youth. I met Stallone about 15 years ago and I know he always wanted to make an impact in Hollywood by being a triple threat. I am sure he knows he has more than done this. It seems, though, that he is trying to go out with a bang by doing stuff like this looking like this. Still, the movie was fun to watch and I took it for what it was. I also like the fact that the old men acted like old men. The young men did what the old men could have done about 15 years ago. The girl wasn't a bad actress either. I would tell anyone renting this to remember that Stallone is just an action hero and take him as such.",6,1,6,29 November 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spiderman Sputtered, Man!
","I paid good money to see this and I was truly disappointed. The acting was superb and the cinematography was better than the Raimi version, but the buck stops there! Sam was a better story teller and you felt you didn't need to know much about the character before watching the movie. This new version lacks the plausibility of the whole story. It seems the director, Webb, wanted to make the unreal more realistic and bring him into our world not realizing that movie goers want to be transported into the world of the fantasy and get a break from ours. Garfield played a brooding web-slinger who was more concerned about finding himself than the killer of his Uncle. I know this movie stayed true to many parts of the comic book, but the character development was lacking and was only compensated by the brilliant actors playing the key roles. Spidey Sense was nowhere in this, his ability to heal quickly, and his reporter angles were also omitted. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that all of New York knew he was Spiderman. All except for Aunt May. I must say that no matter how old Sally Field gets she is still too sexy to play Aunt May. The wrestling angle and the slaying of Uncle Ben were too rushed in my opinion. Lizard seemed too powerful to be foiled by the weaker watered down version of Spiderman. Maybe Mr. Webb believed he was more qualified than anyone else because of his name. Even the explanation of how he got bitten was never properly explored. Garfield has a James Dean like quality in his acting and you felt as if you were more comfortable watching PP outside of the costume because Spiderman's identity was never truly developed. I would recommend watching the first two Raimi Spiderman movies than this watered down hapless version. The ending left you dissatisfied as if you were given a Whopper without any meat.",4,17,35,5 July 2012
Gone Girl," Three out of four ain't bad
",I loved the first three quarters of this movie but I think the ending was ridiculous and almost funny. The acting was great but the premise became ridiculous. All clues point to the aloof husband as a missing wife cast is investigated. The whole town helps to figure out the whereabouts of Kate. I was hoping for more aha moments but it became so far fetched it disappointed me. I must give it credit for being an extraordinary tale and it had me guessing all throughout. Ben Afleck did a superb job in a part that seemed made for him and Ms. Rosemund Pike did a great USA accent. Three out of the four stages of this movie is great.,6,2,6,10 February 2015
Avatar," Great Message, Simple Familiar Story
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Still, there were some part you wondered why he put them in. The basketball scene and stuff like that. The story seemed familiar but the method is all Cameron's. I know there were many plot mistakes and technical blunders but only he real trained eye could catch them. Instead you excuse them and take part in the journey. I would watch it again. I love the ore angle and the fuel possibilities. The only thing I always have a problem with Cameron is the way her shapes his characters to be all good or all bad. Still, this is a great cinematic treat I haven't had in a long time. The CGI was astounding and I love the fact that he made the world CGI so the characters could seamlessly interact. My brother thought the lead was really crippled until I explained to him how it was done. Cameron knows something many to her movie makers need to learn. We want to escape for a minute and not think about reality. Yet he injects modern day problems into this and it works.",8,2,4,13 January 2010
The Green Mile," The Formula that works
",The movie was good. I enjoyed it on one level and was slightly disappointed in the turns it took. It touched themes of racism and even played upon our own feelings about color and mental illness. The movie tried it's best to walk the green mile of movie telling by making the characters either fully terrible or fully good. My only problem with this movie is the fact that a mentally challenged man of color could be allowed to be wrongly electrocuted for a crime against little white girls. All they had to do was let the warden and anyone else (even the parents) touch John and see the crime as well. To allow an innocent man to die and call it a tear jerker is beyond me. The scene where John walks in to the warden's wife's room was totally innuendo with overtones which were unnecessary. The editor pulled down her dressed after the shock factor. Why couldn't the big healer get exonerated and a twist be put on the old formula where John studies Holistic medicine and become 'Somebody'? I wonder when we will transcend the usual stereotypes and not let the societal monster live. King seems to paint his characters with wide brushes but the sacrificing of the same types of people become formulaic. Obviously in the thirties this was most likely impossible in Louisiana but it was also impossible to put a black prisoner with whites. I guess we believe what we are allowed to believe.,6,1,3,7 January 2011
Prometheus," Too much hype, not enough delivery
",I would at first like to say that the movie was lit very well and the scale graphics were worth the 40 dollars I spent taking my sons to see it in 3D. The only problem was the movie itself. It was much to do about nothing. There were no surprises nor were there any true moments of wonder for me. When Scott did Gladiators I was intrigued by the way the story was told and I cannot say the same thing with Prometheus. The villains weren't clearly defined and none of the characters were developed enough for us to care whether they lived or died. It seems as if Mr. Scott had set out to do a really great job and the studio stepped in and told him to make it a bit of nonsense with action. Nothing was left for the viewer to resolve or figure out. When it ended i felt as if I was served a one course meal with no real taste. The actors all did their jobs and Fassbender stole the picture. For the rest of the 2 hours I just wanted it to be over. No new revelation peppered my brain and I was hoping something fresh and unique would wow me. Idris Elba did his best to be believable but he was no Yappeth Koto. The other 'Red Shirts' were a non issue where you cared not if they lived or died. The scientists seemed like confused neophytes and I still don't know who was in charge of this mission. I wished they had more screenings before the release. I am guessing a real great movie is lying on the cutting room floor waiting to be released on DVD.,6,1,3,11 June 2012
Taken 2," Miss-Taken
","This movie is built upon so many hateful stereo types of middle Eastern people, it even insults non Islamic people. The plot for the next taking of the main characters is so idiotic, it makes me want to barf! The main idea of him working in a foreign land where the writer makes as inept as possible would have any close friend suggest they vacation in the US and Canada for a while (LOL). The daughter learns very fast to drive a stick shift during a time of crisis when she doesn't even have a US license. Liam seems to be the only action hero left and at 60+, he still does it well. I just wish this formula would go back to the 80's and 90's. Taken 2 was just a chance to cash in on the fears of others. Turkey is not a black veiled woman country and the police would have intervened after the first grenade went off.",3,1,2,29 November 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Great Movie with Great Actors
",I think this movie is a refreshing change of pace for all directors to learn from. The careful quirky (Little Rascals/Peanuts) style allows a near fifty year old memories of being in love with a strange girl which made me feel free. The journey taken by the main young characters allows the others to grow into feeling colorful beings who were once bland and colorless. I would watch Wes Anderson movies along with the Cohen Brothers stuff any day. The point of view throughout the entire movie allows us to become young again. Bill Murray makes me laugh in anything he does. His shoe throwing scene was hilarious. It seems that the major actors playing minor parts allows us to become fascinated in the way the minor parts have major implications as the movies paces along. Not too crazy about the young love scenes but I remember being a young lad trying to figure out just what real love was about. The ending credits were a treat to a musician who loves school orchestras. I also loved the way the children signing made me feel as if I was a friend of Charlie Brown.,10,2,5,29 November 2013
