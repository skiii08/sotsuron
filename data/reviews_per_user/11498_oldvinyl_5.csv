Deepwater Horizon," Might make you shout out loud
","This film pleasantly surprised me by giving more entertainment value than expected, considering it's a true story, we all followed the news at the time and we know what happened. In trying to decide why it was such good entertainment, I think it's 70% due to the sheer realism of the scenes, and 30% due to the acting. I don't mean to imply the quality of the acting was only 30%, no; it was pretty good in my opinion. The quality of life and routine on the rig was covered very well, we should remember that even the helicopter trips there and back are a risk in their own right. In the post-accident scenes there's a tremendous sense of the sheer violence of the environment, more resembling a war zone during a bombardment than a workplace. The downside, though, at least for me, was that all this confusion led to a sense of my not knowing anything, really, about what was going on. Rather than a linear story line moving along a sequence of locations, we're in multiple locations with multiple story lines which blur into one another; with this technique the director does transmit the terrifying sense of 'OMG what do we do now' that those on the rig must have suffered. Definitely worth watching.",7,0,0,8 October 2016
Rocketman," You will cry.
","Film of the week. No, month. No - film of the YEAR!
It is indeed a musical. And normally I am not a fan of musicals, because, you know, The Sound Of Music and all that tat. But this one ... the songs are first, Elton John, and secondly, all the performers can sing really damn well. The production values are superb.
It will almost certainly make you cry. And laugh.
I cannot recommend this too highly. 10 out of 10.",10,0,3,7 July 2019
Train to Busan," Scream, shout, and jump about.
","I had to watch this movie in two parts because after seeing half of it, I was all screamed out. I'm not a great fan of zombie movies, I don't watch Walking Dead, but this film impressed me enormously because the zombies are, first, only incidental to the plot; and secondly, they have allowed the director to incorporate some truly wonderful and bizarre concepts. The film starts in a subtle sort of way. Watch carefully or you'll miss things. It's nice to see how the director uses these half- glimpsed horrors to show the dawning comprehension of the passengers on the train, that something seems to be going wrong with the world. The director Sang-ho Yeon, who also wrote the screenplay, is adept at stretching out the agony to improbable levels as time after time the zombies almost get to chow down on the passengers. But as I said earlier, this is a long film, and there's only a certain amount of time before chowing down does indeed occur, and a whole lot more, besides. The high point of the film, for me, comes when the train nearly crashes headlong into a disaster scene at an intermediate station. Somehow the passengers and driver must find another train to continue their journey to Busan, and - they hope - safety. And now begin screaming again. I'm giving this film 10 points because of so many things, but mainly the sheer inventiveness of Sang-ho Yeon.",10,2,6,24 October 2016
Bird Box," Absolute bilge.
","It would be hard to spoil the plot of this movie because it doesn't have one. I found it exceptionally annoying due to one thing: we never see, nor is it explained, in any shape or form, what the 'monsters' are. And, frankly, I found the concept of the monsters being able to instantly make people commit suicide, plainly ridiculous. It's just Sandra Bullock and two children (who might as well be stuffed dolls for all the input they create) wandering around with blindfolds on.
This film could and should have been so much better. Perhaps the budget was so tiny - maybe ten dollars or so - that the producer found it impossible to create a coherent and convincing storyline.
What a waste of time. Even the ending was garbage. No plot. Little emotional content. 99% filler.",1,6,9,4 January 2019
Macbeth," What were they thinking?
","I managed to struggle through about half of this. Probably it would have been wonderful if I happened to speak Shakespearean English. Unfortunately, like everyone else on the planet except a few English professors, I don't. I cannot imagine American viewers taking to this film. Not only is the English regional, but it is written in the original dialogue, which makes it pretty much impossible to understand what's going on. The cinematography is superb, the actors look stunningly authentic, the acting appears to be faultless - but even if it had subtitles (it doesn't) it would be incomprehensible. Why, oh why, did the producers not render it in a more modern form of English? They must be mad.",5,6,11,24 January 2016
