The Hangover," The Hangover:. A Redaction of The Loft
","'The Hangover,' 2009. Directed by Todd Phillips. Starring Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, and Ed Helms. This movie is a hilarious buddy/road trip picture about a Batchelor Party gone wrong. The setting is 'Loss' Vegas where what goes on in Vegas stays in Vegas. Unfortunately, one of the party members makes sure that everyone's memory stays as well. And the reconstruction of the events of the previous night's events makes for almost slapstick hilarity. But, for me, the part of the movie featuring Mike Tyson was the funniest. If you have seen 'The Loft,' you will recognize that the film is a redaction of 'The Hangover.' Both films are good, with 'The Loft' being the best of the two.
TH is on Netflix. I give it 4 of 5 stars. Enjoy!",9,0,2,4 February 2020
Knives Out," Knives Out
","'Knives Out,' (2019). Directed and written by Rian Johnson. Starring, Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Don Johnson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is a movie worth watching several times! In fact, it reminded me of sitting in front of our brand new 1952 Philco black and white snowy, stripey first tv, watching a 40s 'The Butler Did It' film. Complete with a New Orleans creepy mansion and a cast of devious and deceitful characters. And a convoluted, intricate plot. It had more twists and turns than a dog's hind leg. But for me, my favorite character was Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig. Who would have thought that he could nail a Southern accent? I am thinking that the setting was supposed to be New Orleans, complete with architecture and props. However, Daniel's accent was not quite a Nawlins accent. But close enough! I loved this film. I give it 5 of 5 stars.",10,0,1,1 July 2020
A Bridge Too Far," ABTF: Attenborough's Feeble Shot
","I have just seen 'A Bridge Too Far, (1977). It was directed by Richard Attenborough. It has so many big, well-known stars that you might think that it was hoped that because of them, the film couldn't possibly fail. I'm thinking that they left Elvis out merely out of a semblance of modesty. However, having modern-day movie heroes as main characters did not actually translate to the vast scope of the heroic effort of the mission. The chief officer of the operation tried to liken, for our edification, the situation as the Germans are the bad guys; the paratroopers as the homesteaders; and the Thirty Corps as the cavalry. Such was the mentality of the screenwriter.
In the AHC episode of 'Those Damned Engineers,' the arc of their story had elements of danger, the unknown, surprise, moment-to-moment taut chess-like precision moves which evinced the superior caliber of U.S. forces. ABTF is stilted and wooden. The contrast is so evident. This story should be retold in the way AHC-TDE keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats and leaves them awestruck. And so grateful for Divine intervention.
After writing this, I went to IMDB and looked up Roger Ebert's review of this film, and we were in total agreement. Check out his review. This story deserves to be told for obvious reasons. I know who should star in it. And a few directors who could do it justice. So, I'm waiting....",10,0,0,4 February 2020
The Water Diviner," TWD: A Mock Redaction of Legends of the Fall
","'The Water Diviner,' (2014). Directed by Russell Crowe. Starring Russell Crowe, Olga Kurylenko, and Yilmaz Edogan. This is a wonderful movie. It is, in fact, a redaction of the mock epic,'Legends of the Fall,' (LOTF). The writers, Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios, must have analyzed the plot points and determined that some of them needed to be corrected because their impetus was based on faulty humanistic ideals. For instance, in LOTF, the three Ludlow boys go off to join WWI because they feel a patriotism to Germany and their cousins in the war. But in TWD, to Connor, the guiding principle for going to war is to make a statement of principle rather than land acquisition. There are many such dichotomies. Included in the dichotomies is the point of view of the Turks, the invaded country, by a ranking colonel of the enemy forces, played by Yilmaz Erdogan. This film reflects a humanistic, enlightened world view. And it shows us the transformation of the power of familial love. This is a point-of-view movie that will lift the spirit. In the beginning of the movie, we see how geographical empath Connor uses his gift to find water. But as the story progresses, we see Connor develop his spiritual powers to be of service to people who need him. It's a wonderfully uplifting film and touches that which is human in us.
This movie is on Netflix. 5 of 5 stars. Enjoy!",10,0,1,4 February 2020
