The Lobster," Totally pointless
","This movie is supposedly dystopian, but even dystopian movies depict future societies whose leaders have a vision or an objective that, while unappealing, can be understood. Unfortunately for the viewer, the rules of this dystopian society have no discernible objective. Without including spoilers, I'll simply say that the viewer will be unable to discern whether the new society wishes to limit population, eradicate love, or simply ensure the pairing of like personalities. To add to the confusion, the insurgents opposing this dystopia have rules that - while different - are no less inexplicable and seemingly pointless. One of the advantages of streaming is the ability to advance through the tedium. Anyone who sat in a theater to view this pointless movie and made it to the closing credits either has no life or merely wanted to get their money's worth. To Netflix subscribers I can say only this. Don't expect to be entertained, shocked, surprised, or enlightened.",1,2,4,19 December 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," The Christ Redemption story
","The final installment of the Matrix series mimics the sacrifice of Jesus. Neil must die in order to free humanity from the Matrix and allow it to enter the paradise of a restored and beautiful earth. Whether the Wachowskis, born into a Polish Catholic family, believe the Christ Redemption story or simply used it as a plot device, I do not know. The dramatic resolution is somewhat unsatisifying in that it is not clear whether the earth has been restored and humanity freed. The film possesses the same enticing green tint of the two previous installments and the the film's special effects, like the first two, are both imaginative and exceedingly well done. Viewing this installment without having seen the first two may cause the viewer to judge this final chapter as unsatisfying and possibly pointless.",7,2,3,9 May 2019
Donnie Darko," The hallucinations during the last moments of Donnie's life
","This conjecture is not a spoiler. After seeing the movie, I concluded, almost instantly, that the events depicted in the film are nothing more than the hallucinations (or dream) of Donnie Darko just before he dies. I realize there seems to an insufficient amount of time between impact and the ultimate death of Donnie for such a long hallucination to run, but nevertheless this is my belief. I admit, however, that I'm not aware that the screen writer or director every stated or even intimated that such is the gist of the film.",Null,0,0,27 December 2019
