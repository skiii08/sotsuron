The Legend of Bagger Vance," Beautiful
","This movie is beautiful in every way, and beautiful is not a word I use a lot.  The cinematography is masterful, of course, but there is more to the core of this movie then I think some critics are giving it credit for. 'It is a game that cannot be won, only played.' What a great way to approach life.  To say this movie is like a supermodel, pretty but empty, is to completely miss the point of the movie.  The beauty is its heart and its message.  It is touching in a completely understated way, just like life.",10,0,1,5 November 2000
