Ford v Ferrari," An Epic Fast Paced Film
","My family are big motor sport fans so I had to see Le Mans 66 or as it is mainly known Ford V Ferrari and this film was an experience and one of my favourite films of recent memory. The premise of the film sees two ambitous drivers try to create a Ford to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hour Le Mans race. Christian Bale plays the lead in the film and he is fantastic in this film, he is so charismatic and charming and you truly care about his character in the film. An Oscar Nomination is waiting for him for sure, his chemistry with Matt Damon is brilliant and one of the best duos in recent memory. As said Matt Damon is great in the film too, he compliments Bale so well and his loud personality really works for this film and there is most definitley an Oscar nomination ready for him. Jon Bernthal is in this film and also does a great job, he is pretty likeable in the film and I felt like he was a character we were meant to like and sympathise with. The rest of the cast also do a great job, they all fit there roles brilliantly and feel like they fit into the movie flawlessly. The story is fascinating, seeing these two companies go to war over building a car is great, and seeing the different personalities clashing, it feels real and like these people are working on something that really matters. The script is great, a true mix of humour and drama, it makes everybody in the film feel very realy and interesting. The style of the film is breathtaking, the race scenes keep you on the edge of your seat and build the tension superbly, the film never really slows down and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Overall this is a pretty amazing film that needs to be seen by all film fans and will be remembered as a classic.",10,1,4,29 November 2019
The King's Speech," A phenomenal heartwarming film
",I have heard allot of great this about this movie and now I have seen it I can say that the kings speech is an excellent movie. The premise of this film is in the early 1900s the duke of york is in line for the throne of England and has to deliver a speech to rally the nation. Unfortunately he has a huge stutter so he gets a coach to aid him in his quest to deliver this speech. Now I just saw the railway man and kingsman the secret service with great performances by Colin firth but wow he is incredible in this film. He actually had me believing that he had a stutter and it really brings out the emotion in you seeing this man truly afraid of talking. His performance was sublime and he totally owned this movie and deserved his Oscar win. Geoffrey rush is his speech therapist and he is also fantastic in this movie. His relationship with firth is what carries the movie and you feel the confidence in this commoner with the king. Helena Bonham carter and guy Pearce were also really good in there smaller roles and really added allot to this movie. The premise of this story sounds boring but trust me it really isn't. The journey if these two individuals is amazing and you see the pain and emotion that goes into this friendship and you buy every minute of it. Also it shows the true pressure on the monarch and how some normal people thrust into the situation would act. The script is fantastic with some of the best dialogue of recent memory with a tremendous blend of humour and drama. The style of this film is beautiful it looks great and the editing of the film is truly phenomenal. The scenes with firth and rush are shot so well that you see them as equals and it is a huge positive in this film. Overall this is one of the best films of recent times and is an absolute must see.,10,2,3,20 September 2015
The Avengers," a fabulous film that proved the dominant superhero films
","After all the films leading to this one we were promised the Avengers on screen and this film gave us that big time. This film sees a group of big personalities having to come together and defeat a mad man and his army from enslaving humanity. One of the most important parts of the build up to this film was Robert Downey jnr's performance as Tony stark/iron man, and he is just as awesome in this film. His character grows in all these films but he is still the narcissist that we love. Also Chris Evans as captain America was really important as he is the leader and comes across as the moral compass of the whole film but he isn't boring which is great for the character. The rest of the performances are great as well, first of all is the recasting of Mark ruffalo as Bruce banner/hulk and he was the biggest surprise in this film. He was great in both roles and the hulk has absolutely never been better then this film. Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor and this guy is absolutely seriously movie star and makes this character a great character full of personality. Scarlett Johansson returns as black widow and she is sexy and tough while also proving that she is also the best female in these superhero films around. Samuel L Jackson is back as Nick fury and he is great as the character and squeezes the most he can out of this great character. The one member of the team that isn't really developed is Hawkeye, he isn't really himself for the most of the movie but even then the last battle he becomes great. What is important in a film like this is having a great villain and Tom hiddlestone as Loki definitely succeeds at that. He is just so fun to watch and you buy that he could pull off all this destruction. Sometimes simplicity is best for a story and this is one of those times, it has happened before that a group of combustible elements have to team up but this film gets the most out of it and adds real drama to the film. The script is the best part of the film and the dialogue between the characters is what makes this film so enjoyable to watch because it makes all the characters feel unique and there own personalities. The style of this film is great, the action is all enjoyable and the film looks great but I have to mention the show stealer that is the incredible hulk. This is the best interpretation of the hulk and he looks better then ever and he is possibly the best character in the film. Overall this is one of my favourite films ever and this is a comic book fans dream.",10,38,55,21 October 2014
Blade Runner 2049," A great sequel that is jaw dropping
","This film has been gaining a lot of hype with some people saying it is the best film of the year, I have now seen blade runner 2049 and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film is set 30 years after the original seeing a new blade runner attempt to work out a mystery that could rock society. Ryan gosling plays agent k the main blade runner in this film and he does a great job carrying this film on his shoulders as the lead. He adds depth to his role as he goes through a real journey of discovery throughout the film which builds a lot of layers to the role. Harrison Ford reprises his role of deckard and he is really great in the film. He isn't in the film that much but when he is he owns every scene that he is in. Jared leto and Robin wright are in smaller roles in the film and they both do very solid jobs with what they are given to work with, which isn't that much. I really liked the character of goslings AI romantic interest and I was fully invested in them and there struggles in the film. The story similar to the first film has a lot of philosophical question's raised and they are interesting enough, I enjoyed watching the investigation that gosling had to go through in the film and as mentioned before the romance was a real strong point. But similar to the first film I feel like this film attempts too many sub plots that I really didn't care about that just caused the film to have a much longer run time then was necessary, which I will go into later. The script is very good, with a lot of well written dialogue that helps make these characters interesting to watch, mixed in with a little bit of fun humour too. The style of the film has jaw dropping amazing visual effects that really need to be seen to be believed, with some decent action scenes as well. However, now to the pacing of the film, this film is nearly 3 hours long and it really shouldn't have been. The film takes its time but to a ridiculous degree at times that will have you would dieting if you are enjoying the film, but I managed to pull through. Overall I actually prefer this film to the original blade runner and think it should definitely be seen especially if you are a fan of the original.",8,8,17,8 October 2017
Angels & Demons," An average sequel that doesn't improve enough on the original
","Having just seen the da vinci code and in preparation for inferno I have watched angels and demons today and I feel like this film is similar to the original and doesn't improve. The premise of the film sees professor robert langdon brought in to investigate a murder linked to the Vatican. Tom hanks is back as langdon and is probably the best part of this film. He gives a strong performance and his character fits hanks really well so you get behind him. Ewan McGregor is in this film and he also does a great job with a layered performance that makes you appreciate how good an actor he is. Stellan skarsgard plays the police captain, he does a decent job in this film even.though his character isn't given much development at all. The only performance I didn't like at all was ayelet zurer who just comes across as the obligatory female character that doesn't have any character or development at all. The plot is just like the previous film that it is basically a treasure hunt that gets a bit too complex and bloated for its own good. It does have some interesting moments and I like McGregor's side plot but there are scenes that are unnecessary and a twist that is too predictable. The script also sees no improvement, the dramatic dialogue just doesn't hit and it doesn't get you emotionally invested like it should. Also there is literally like no humour that really hurts the film. The style of this film is allot darker then the da vinci code and that is a good decision for the film. But this film is very slow and sloppily paced that it feels longer then it actually is. Overall this is an average film that isn't as good as It could have been.",5,0,0,19 October 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," a fantastic second half that improves on the first
","I really did like kill bill vol 1, however, I did think it lacked something possibly due to the fact it is a film that mainly sets up the sequel. This film once again sees the bride return of the bride on her killing spree to get to her final showdown with her old master bill. I think the first kill bill was a return to form for uma Thurman and it continued with this film with the character of the bride being expanded on and her performance being more well rounded. The supporting cast is also really good with David carrehane being fantastic as bill and his performance was necessarily great because it made the revenge hunt more interesting. The other characters are great with budd and the one eyed assassin being great characters and adding overall to the plot. As I said in my faster movie review I really like revenge stories and this one was almost flawless with the emphasis on the revenge theme really working but I do think some of the flash backs were too long and also the ending is really anticlimactic. The script is Tarantino genius and it really helps this film's story be driven along nicely. The style is also not as over the top as the first film and all the action is great with the fight scenes being very crisp. I advise you watch the two kill bill films back to back it will make the experience a lot better for this fantastic film.",9,1,2,26 November 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A film that reminds us the pirates films are not all great
","The return of Captain Jack for a few years and is it terrible no but is it great no, it fits somewhere in the middle ground of just good. This film shows Jack Sparrow, his old love Angelica, her Father the notorious Blackbeard, the British led by former pirate Captain Barbossa and the Spanish Armada all searching for the fountain of youth for their own reasons. Now even though in my opinion the character of Jack Sparrow has ruined Johnny Depp's acting career but he is great at it and you can tell how much fun he has being Jack Sparrow and his performance in this film is great. Now even though some didn't like Keira Knightley in the other films I believe that she is so much better then Penelope Cruz in this film and I believe her performance to be one of the big negatives in this film. However, Ian Mcshane as Blackbeard was an inspired choice and he is truly evil and menacing in this film continuing the tradition of great pirate villains. The return of Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is fantastic and just like Depp you can tell how much fun he has in this role and his chemistry with Depp continues their tradition of being fantastic. The secondary character of the missionary and the story of him and the mermaid was terrible in this film and was just such a huge distraction that I hated. For the story, it is not good at all, it is in fact all over the place. There is just too many people going after the fountain and some are not even in depth also as I mentioned before the secondary story of the missionary and Mermaid is terrible. The script is pretty decent with Sparrow, Blackbeard and Barbossa all have great lines but there is some weak dialogue especially by Cruz. Just like the rest of the pirates films the style is fantastic, the cinematography is great and the soundtrack is awesome. This film is a mixed bag and I hope the next one is better.",6,0,0,7 July 2014
Alien 3," A truly awful sequel that tries to ruin the previous films in the franchise
","And now we get to the highly controversial alien 3 on the list of alien films to watch before alien covenant and boy this one is truly horrible. The premise of the film sees Ripley crash land on a planet where she has to survive a group of criminals and an alien that is stowed away on her ship. Sigourney weaver !Ade a lot of demands to return for this film and she does her best but comes across as pretty bland. She is just pretty bland an dull in this film but there was some scenes where I thought she did an okay job but she was just given nothing to work with. Charles dance from game of thrones is in this film and he does a good job in this film but he really isn't used enough to care. Everybody in this film is really useless and I really don't care about any of the supporting characters, especially the prisoners. The story is more similar to alien then aliens, and I felt this film had nothing interesting in it and all the twists and turns just really doesn't work and really hurts this film. There is a big twist at the beginning of the film and it really hurts this film and well basically the whole franchise. The script has some truly awful dialogue in it, the lines are laughable and it really hurts when you are trying to take this film seriously because you truly can't. The style of the film tried to use CGI for its alien and it Looks a absolutely terrible, it is amazing that this film came out after terminator 2. The action scenes are terrible and even the suspense scenes re terrible as well. Overall this is a truly awful film that really is hard to watch and hurts the alien franchise for sure.",2,3,7,6 May 2017
The Incredible Hulk," the forgotten marvel film is still fantastic
","When people talk about the marvel cinematic universe they usually forget about this film and I must admit I was one of those. But now I have seen this film I will admit I think it is fantastic. The film starts with Bruce banner in Brazil attempting to find a cure to his hulk problem. When the American forces led by general Ross and emile blomsky arrive attempting to capture hulk it forces him back to the US to conquer a deadly foe. Now even though he is no longer Bruce banner I thought Edward Norton did a great job on this film and really encapsulated what Bruce banner should be compared to the hulk. You really feel for him throughout his journey and your hoping he wins at the end. Also the supporting cast does a great job I thought liv Tyler as betty Ross was a great choice and she does a great job in her role and the chemistry between her and Norton is also good. Tim Roth also does a fine job as blomsky and the abomination, which must have been hard because he had to be seen as a legitimate threat to the hulk which isn't easy. William hurt as the general was another great casting decision and one that I hope may be revisited one day as he is a good character as well. The story is alright, I like the beginning and I thought banners story was really interesting but the ending bugs me a little bit even though after seeing the avengers I understand why it was done. The script is very good with a serious tone but also a lot of good witty dialogue that helps humanize this story and character. The style is also really cool with both the hulk and the abomination looking great and the style of the film is a big positive. This film is hardly mentioned which is a shame because it is actually fantastic.",9,1,1,9 September 2014
The Monuments Men," a really poor boring film
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film and that makes it even worse with this film being really bad. This film is based on true events documenting a group of collectors looking to recover paintings stolen by the Nazis. This film has a pretty legit cast with actors such as George Clooney (also the director), matt damon, Cate blanchett, bill Murray and John Goodman. However, nobody in this film delivers memorable performances and you know nothing about there characters and I even believe some of them could have been completely written out of the film. The story had the potential to be exciting but the story is a complete snooze fest and hard to watch. A big problem is that this was billed as a team film but you barely see the team altogether, also matt Damon isn't even in the team for the majority of the film. The script is alright with some of the dialogue being funny but also some of it really not hitting. The style is typical ww2 and it doesn't do anything to make itself feel fresh and feels tested by now. Overall this film is a complete poor film and you shouldn't see it.",3,0,1,3 December 2014
Mission: Impossible III," A great return to form for this franchise
","Now I have not seen Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol so I have to say that this is the best Mission Impossible film there has been and a bit of a make up for the bad film that was MI 2. This film sees Ethan Hunt now retired looking to settle down with his girlfriend until one of his students is kidnapped, returning to the field he attempts to save her and stop an evil mastermind from releasing a weapon on the world. Now I gave Tom Cruise some criticism for his performance in the previous film but he is back in form in this film and delivers a great performance that is easily his best in this franchise. The supporting cast all do a really good job, with the late Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the villain and was great in the villainous role that he seemed to thrive in. Ving Rhames returned as Luther in the film and he once again does a great job with his chemistry with Cruise being great. The guy who plays Hunt's IMF ally does a good job even though his relationship with Hunt isn't really explained or looked at that much. Michelle Monaghan plays his girlfriend and she is really good for when she is in it however, her role isn't as big as you would have expected but she still does a good job. The story is okay with the romance and team unity being extended in this film and it is the best so far, however, their is a mcguffin in the film and the overall idea of the villain is not too strong. The script is alright with Rhames and Cruise having good dialogue but the rest is alright and it doesn't really add anything to the film. The style is really cool with the diverse locations adding to the film and making it feel like a worldwide situation. Overall this is a huge improvement and a film definitely worth watching.",8,1,1,5 November 2014
Captain Phillips," A fantastic film that further emphasises Tom Hanks as one of the greatest of all time
",The fact that this film is based on true events that occurred not too long ago just adds to the fantastic achievement that has been accomplished with this film. This film documents the day Captain Phillips had his cargo ship boarded by four somalian pirates and how his situation turned into a hostage situation. Now I cannot believe for one moment that Tom Hanks didn't get nominated for an Oscar for his performance as this is the Tom Hanks show and he carries this film on his back and his phenomenal performance is the best thing about this movie. The Somalian pirates are the only real supporting characters that we are given and they are pretty good especially being new to the acting scene I was impressed. The story is another great positive as it feels so realistic and real even though the story could have felt boring and dull it really doesn't and you put yourself with Captain Phillips and you really feel for his situation. The script is also great and the way the pirates and Hanks deliver their lines adds to this whole experience of entrapment that this character is going through. The style of the film is similar to the story as it is really realistic and gritty and with the use of sound and performance it really truly builds the tension and sets the suspense up for this thriller of a film. This film is fantastic and has hardly any flaws with only a few more detailed supporting characters possibly helping it but overall this is a fantastic realistic film.,9,3,6,4 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The beginning of the end of the Star Wars title
","What Happened George Lucas, What Happened? How could you screw up possibly the most anticipated film of all time to the levels of this film The Phantom Menace. Now as a massive fan of the original Star Wars films I even struggle to watch this film because of how bad it is and what it represents in the ideology of Lucas for Star Wars films. We had our warning with the Ewoks in Return of The Jedi that we should have realised that Star Wars was being turned into a kids film and not a very good one at that. This film is set about 30 years before the original Star Wars and sees two Jedi Qui-Gon-Jin and Obi-Wan-Kenobi attempting to save the planet of Naboo from a hostile takeover from the Sith while also running into a boy who could possibly bring balance to the force. The main negative of this film is the script and just how wooden some of the dialogue is between characters that just shouldn't be, also the main reason I Love Star Wars is because of the characters and how we are meant to identify with them and care about them, in this film you will not really care about anybody even when you are truly meant to. But the straw that breaks the camels back is Jar Jar Binks oh my god this my be the most childish and annoying character ever put on the screen and if people hated The Ewoks then they haven't seen anything close to Jar Jar Binks. There are some positives though like I believe Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor put in good performances as our two Jedi's but that wasn't enough. The main positives for me is The Pod race which I find incredibly cool and exciting and also the final encounter between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. This is one of the best lightsaber fights in Star Wars and it is great because of all three participants. A huge positive as well is that this is Star Wars and the music is always great and this is no different even in this bad film. I am glad we have future Star Wars films and now that Lucas isn't directing I am optimistic that these new films will return Star Wars to its glory days.",3,1,4,18 April 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," A great unique suspense film
","After seeing the trailer for this film I was very interested and I will say that I think this is a great suspenseful film. The premise sees a man rescue a woman after an accident, he takes her to his shelter where he promises to keep her alive. Mary elizabeth winstead plays michelle and she is brilliant in this film. Her character is really easy to root for and your rooting for her throughout the film. John goodman plays howard and he is breathtaking in this film, he is such a complex character and you don't know whether to sympathize with him or be fearful of him. His physical size also really added to his character and his high status. The third character of emmett is a bit less important but he is a nice addition to this bizarre family. The story is good because it truly is plausible that this could happen. You see these three people develop relationships together in a close environment and it really is a tense situation. However, the biggest negative for this film is its ending, no spoilers but it just feels like a different tone and a different film completely in a bad way. The script is great with the drama being drawn out in the best way possible and the humour being a little well placed. The style is good with the intensity being up for most of the film but sometimes the pacing lacks a little bit and there is a little bit of a tone issue. Overall this is a great suspense film that should be seen.",8,1,4,19 March 2016
The Equalizer," A great action film that shows Denzel Washington can still be a huge action star
","With Denzel Washington getting older it could be argued that this would have been a problem for his action career but I must say he is in great condition and I want to see more films with Denzel in roles like this. This film sees Robert McCall a man who gave up a life of action to be a normal human being thrust into action when he feels he must help a young girl from Russian mobsters. Now this is a fantastic performance by Denzel as he totally owns this character, he is the nicest person in the world but he is great when having to turn it completely to that dark side of his character. This film is his and he owns it with his common man action star persona really working for this film. I do believe that the supporting cast is a bit light on detailed characters, this is evident by Chloe grace moretz performance. I think this is completely different to everything she has done and she does it really well, however, she isn't in the film a lot and I do believe that she was underutilised. One thing I did like in this film is that they had a clear villain who they put against McCall and the guy they got to play Teddy did a good job in the role. However, like a lot of action films these days it does lack some other detailed supporting characters which is a bit of a disappointment for this film as I believe it had the potential to have more in depth side characters. The story is a mixed bag, I like the character of McCall and his reasoning for doing certain things and the reasoning behind things seems realistic. But the slower scenes do drag a little bit and towards the end of the film you do wonder why he is still doing what he is doing. The script is great McCall is exactly as I would have wanted him to be and that is what really is the driving force for this film. The style of this film is also really cool there are some people who say it is to artistic but I don't buy that at all. The director Antoine Fuqua really did a good job of coming up with creative kills as well which is great for the audience. This film is going to get some comparisons to Taken, but I think this is a bit of a slower film and more of a realistic thriller and I do like both but I think comparing this film to Taken is a bit harsh. Overall this is a great film and one that if your a fan of thriller action films you should definitely see.",8,3,10,1 October 2014
The Expendables 2," a huge step up and everything i dreamed of in action films
","This film is exactly what the action genre needed with this film overall being lots better then the original expendables. We have the same crew of expendables doing there thing with a few extra awesome helping hands like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, liam hemsworth and chuck Norris. After a death in the group the team is out for revenge against a dangerous leader played by jean Claude vanne damme. This film takes care of what the original messed up as the lulls in the original is gone and replaced with more action and more of the team working together which I wanted in the original. This film starts off with an action scene that trumps anything in the previous film and really set up this awesome action extravaganza. There are some more emotional moments and comedic moments with the epic one liners by especially Schwarzenegger and Willis. Also jean Claude vanne damme owns his role as the villain and he is clearly having fun with his role, but the most awesome part of this film is when Schwarzenegger, Willis, Stallone and a bit of chuck Norris team up and it is every action fans dream and it lives up to it immensely. The only real negatives was the story was a bit weak but it's still a must see if your an action fan.",9,0,0,21 May 2014
War Dogs," A great interesting take on an interesting subject
","This was a film I unfortunately missed last year even though I really wanted to watch it and now I have and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of this film sees two 22 year old men get into the world of arms dealing and slowly get over there heads. Miles teller plays the lead in this film and he does a great job in the film, he is easily the most likable character in this film but he also has the best development of anybody in this film to make you care about his predicament. Jonah hill plays his loudmouth best friend and he fit the role pretty perfectly. He was entertaining to watch and there chemistry is really good but when he needs to be unlikeable he does a really good job of selling that. Bradley cooper is in this film in a smaller role as an arms dealer and he was typically really good in his role, even though it isn't a huge role. I also really liked the performance of Teller's characters girlfriend who gave a strong performance to sell there relationship. The story of the film is pretty fascinating as you go on the journey with these guys and learn the arms dealer industry with teller which helps with connecting with the character. All the twists and turns feel appropriate for the situations that these characters are put in due to there profession. The script has some pretty great humour in it, hill and teller have great chemistry when it comes to there humorous dialogue. However, especially towards the third act I feel like the drama could have been more heated and it doesn't really hit the emotion that you need it to. The style of the film shows this industry as a cool lavish lifestyle and it makes you understand why these characters would find this lifestyle such an appeal. However, this film gets a little ridiculous towards the end and it just isn't as interesting as I found the first hour of the film to be. Overall this is a great fun film that should be seen because of just how cool it is.",8,0,0,10 July 2017
Skyfall," Great continuation of best modern day action films
","It is true I have never been a huge fan of James Bond but I really enjoyed Casino Royale and believe Quantum of Solace wasn't as bad as many critics believed. So now, I have finally seen Skyfall I have to admit I enjoyed this Bond film but not as much as I did Casino Royale, this Bond film really stays to its true roots but this one has more narrative to it and a much larger role to Judi Dench's character of 'M' and slightly less of Daniel Craig. This was a nice change for me because my main turn-off from the previous Bond's is the lack of narrative and most of them being the same but the new Daniel Craig Bonds has changed my opinion on future Bonds. However, that strength could also be seen as a big weakness as there are points in this film where it seems boring for a Bond film with too much of the film without Bond involved. Also, the film in my opinion is too long for a bond film. However, the positives out way the negatives with such things as the locations which are fantastically shown off, the style of these new bonds is alive with references to the past bonds in there which appeases the older generation and Javier Bardem playing the villain which was a highlight to add to the story. Overall a solid addition to the Bond franchise.",8,2,7,16 January 2014
The Hangover," A fantastic film which is utterly hilarious
","With this franchise being a trilogy it has been a mixed bag, however, I am seeing it for the first time and it is a fantastic start. This film sees 3 friends throwing their friend a bachelor party in Las Vegas until they lose him the next day and have to find him to get him back to his wedding in time. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are all fantastic in the film and their chemistry together is insane and really carries this film into the legendary status it has become. The rest of the cast does a really good job as well with the meetings with these characters being really enjoyable and helping fuel the adventure. The story is good for the idea and the concept of The Hangover but it does have the problem that a lot of the scenes are just random and don't affect the story and this is really the only negative of the film. The script is fantastic with the dialogue between the characters being great and helping the films overall quality. I love the idea of the style of Las Vegas and this film encapsulates it well also this film knew exactly what it is and didn't try to go too far. Overall this film is fantastic and really is one of the best comedies has to offer.",9,1,2,19 November 2014
Iron Man 3," A good film but could have been better
","This film has a lot of controversy surrounding it but I will say straight away that I do like iron man 3. The premise of this film sees Tony Starks life turned upside down when he encounters the mysterious mandarin. Meanwhile, an organisation use a drug to try and take down the president of the United states. Now one thing nobody can deny is that Robert Downey jnr's performance is great as Tony stark. Even though he is now an avenger he hasn't changed, he is just as narcissistic and arrogant as he always has been and it is why we love Tony stark. The supporting cast is also great, Gwyneth paltrow returns as pepper Potts and she is given more to do in this film as she is great in these films. Her chemistry with Downey is fantastic and is one of the best romance stories in comic book film history. Don Cheadle returns as Rhodey and he is great in the role and once again his chemistry with Downey is a great part of the film. Guy Pearce is really good in this film as Aldrich killian and even though his character is a bit cliché he manages to make it work. Ben kingsley plays the mandarin and he is really good in the film with his menacing demeanour really makes his character menacing. Now some of the twists of the story do work in action film turns and they are good ideas but the story does fall a bit flat, this is because there is one twist in the film that people will either like or hate. I am one of those people who hate this twist and I think it does drop the quality of this film. The script did a good job of getting a lot of humour in the film, however, the mix of drama and humour didn't really work in the film and it felt a little out of place. The action scene all look great and this is the best that iron man has ever looked. But the problem is that this film is a complete Tony stark film but iron man is barely in the film and it takes away from the whole thing. Overall I do like this film but I really do believe that it could have been better.",7,1,2,16 January 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," easily one of my favourite films of all time
","In my opinion this film was revolutionary and changed the landscape for action films and forced directors to up their game with new franchises. This film sees adventurer Indiana Jones hired by the us government to find the ark of the covenant with help from his ex love Marion and his Egyptian ally salah before the Nazis led by Renee belloq an opposing archaeologist. Now Harrison ford as Indiana Jones is one of the most iconic roles ever and I love him in this role because of his charisma but also roughness that allow him to feel relatable to the audience. Also the supporting cast was really good as well with Karen Allen shining as Marion and her chemistry with Jones is superb and really helps the film feel natural. John Rhys Davies is also great as salah and he brings a sense of every day man and also a good comedic character that brings a lot of heart to the film. Another performance like that is the character of Marcus Brody Indies uni ally as he provides good comedic timing and a good chemistry with Jones and I'm glad he gets more to do in future films. Belloq was also a really good villain and was a good mirror for Jones in this already fantastic film. The story is great as well with the different strands of storytelling from the religious links to the ark, the relationship between Marion and Jones and also the Nazis vs Jones for the first time. It just works in ever way and this story gives me two of my favourite film moments ever with the rolling ball scene and also the black vailed ninja scene. The script is great with everybody having great dialogue and really making out a sense of realism within this sort of unrealistic story. Now the style of Indiana Jones is always positive with that awesomely iconic theme song to the iconic hat and whip, plus the unique opponent of the Nazis I think it really works. This is an epic film that really changed cinema and helped the industry",10,3,6,18 September 2014
Deepwater Horizon," A fantastic dramatic film that pulls on the heartstrings.
","This film has been gaining allot of buzz since it came out and I have now seen deepwater horizon and this is a very interesting fantastic film. The premise of the film sees based on true events a group of technicians who are caught on a malfunctioning oil rig. Mark wahlberg plays mike our main protagonist and he gives one of his best performances in this film, he plays our blue collar hero and you are behind him the entire film. He also gives allot of passion to the role and respect for the real life person. Kurt russell plays the head of deepwater horizon and he does a very good job in the role. John malkovich plays the bp representative and he is truly evil in this film but delivers a charismatic performance that you want to listen to. Kate hudson plays wahlberg's wife at home and she does a good job in this film and her chemistry with wahlberg is really good. The story of the film is obviously based off of a true story and when the action starts on the rig you are invested in the situation. Also this film has allot of important subject matter that should be seen. Also there is some nice character interactions in the first act of the film. The script has allot of great dramatic dialogue that does make you care about the people that are involved in the situation. Also when the film tries humour it works for the most part. The style of the film has great action scenes and truly scary visual scenes when this event happens. However, I do feel like the parts before the incident felt quite drawn out and long which did hurt my anticipation in this film. Overall I really enjoyed this film and feel it is an important film for people to see.",9,1,3,4 October 2016
Detroit," A great gripping film
","After seeing the trailer and hearing about the premise for this film I knew I had to see detroit and I have and it is a really good film. The premise of the film is set in the detroit riots and sees a white policeman using questionable methods to try and find a sniper. John boyega plays a security guard involved with the incident and he is really good in the film. You see how he is just an average guy who doesn't really take a side in the conflict but tries to do the right thing. You care about him and want to see him sort this situation out. But the best performance in this film has to go to will poulter who plays the white police officer in charge of the investigation. He sells the brutality of the situation expertly well and he owns every scene that he is in. Anthony mackie is in this film in a smaller role and he does a really good job in the role adding to the believability of the situation his character is put in. Everybody did a great job in this film from the victims to the police officers all give great convincing performances. The story in the film is very simple but effective, seeing this mystery going on is interesting and obviously the racial tension brings conflict. But I also feel especially for the first act of the film it tries to set up a lot that didn't make me care more about the characters at all. Also I think the films ending is a little too long and drags on. The script has some really good dialogue in it mainly of the dramatic persuasion which helps add to the tension that that is built in the film. The style of the film is really gripping, the brutality of some of the actions is horrifying to watch at times but it is effective. However, sometimes the saying less is more is effective too and I feel like at a point in the film that it was getting a bit repetitive that you just instinctively lose interest the more you see it which was a problem for me with this film. Overall detroit is an important film and if you can handle it, this is a must watch.",8,2,9,6 September 2017
John Wick," An epic action film that may go down as one of the best ever
","With it finally getting a UK release I finally got a chance to see the much hyped John wick and my goodness did this film deliver. The premise of this film sees an ex hit man who has lost everything going after the men who took it all away from him. Now I have never been a huge keannu Reeves fan but I gotta say he fits this role perfectly. He was a badass who dished out allot of headshots on villains but also you connected with his character because you believed in what he was doing and in his motivations. The villain is the bad guy from mission impossible ghost protocol and he wasn't really that memorable in that film. But he is fantastic in this film he is a multi layered villain that provides a good adversary for John wick and you buy that he could do some of the terrible things that he does in the film. Willem Dafoe is in the film and even though his role isn't that large he is great in it and makes you care about his character as well as John wick. Adrianne pallicki is one of my favourite actresses to watch at the moment and she was great in this film. She was deadly, sexy and evil which made her an awesome character in this film. The only negative was the bad guys son was really annoying and yes I get that because he is meant to be but it felt over the top. If you had described the story to somebody before seeing this film they would tell you that it couldn't work. But it just does in this film the premise is so simple that it works and you really want John wick to succeed in his mission. The script is surprisingly really good and it actually had more humour then I expected which is surprising because the trailer made it seem like complete darkness. The style of this film is phenomenal, I have never seen a person hit more headshots in a film then John wick and the action scenes are great and a reminder of what good action films can be. Also what is great is the world building in this film with unique ideas given to this film that I think they can really build on in future films which I hope there is. Overall John wick is fantastic and is one of the best action films I have ever seen.",10,5,11,12 April 2015
Kung Fu Panda," An epic underrated animation
","When people talk about the truly great animations I feel like there is one that isn't mentioned enough and that is kung fu panda. The premise of this film sees the fat panda po chosen as the dragon warrior who has to learn kung fu and defeat an all powerful enemy. Now I love the character po because he is somebody we the audience can relate too and connect with. He is also excellently voiced by jack black who manages to bring this panda on the level of characters like buzz lightyear and woody of likability. The rest of the cast are great too, Dustin Hoffman is great as his master and you see their relationship develop as the film progresses. The warriors the furious five were great voiced by greats like Angelina jolie and Jackie chan. There characters grew throughout the film and became likable by the end. Ian mcshane plays the villain tai lung and he was perfect for the role. His character is actually really interesting and mcshane did a really good job. The story is pretty basic but I thought it was done fantastically well. Nearly every character develops in the film and you care about them by the end which really isn't easy in an animation. The script was fantastic, people love the humour in this film and it is all hilarious but there is also some really good heartfelt dramatic scenes that worked really well. The style was great, all the animation looks fantastic and the action scenes really help sell the big stakes in this film. Overall this is one of my favourite animations and it should definitely be seen.",10,0,0,22 August 2015
Gravity," An utterly epic adventure
","I have heard a lot of buzz about this film with its massive success and I must say this film is absolutely superb. This film documents a medical scientist and a retiring astronaut attempting to survive a disaster in space that can bring out new leases on life for at least one of them. Now there are really only two performances in this film from A-listers Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and they both deliver great performances. Bullock really carries the film and she delivers a great performance by making the audience buy into her character and really believe in her situation as she panics like you do. Clooney has a slightly smaller role but is still great with his calm and cool character and it seems Clooney may be hitting his stride again. The story at first could have seemed a bit generic but it really hits home just how severe this situation has become and how it affects Sandra Bullocks characters life. The script was one thing that could have hurt the movie because the dialogue between Bullock and Clooney had to be good because they are the only people in it, and I must say I thought for the fact that it was only them two I thought they did a very good job with the script. But the best part of Gravity and the thing looked at the most is the style of the film, the cinematography of space is fantastic and everything shown including the destruction involved in space just everything about it is fantastic. This film blew me away and coming in at an hour and a half is the right length and is the superb demonstration of space films.",10,3,5,2 September 2014
Wind River," A fantastic slow burn thriller
","I had heard a lot of stellar reviews for this film so I decided to go and see it and I found this film pretty enthralling to watch. The premise sees a hunter and a rookie police officer try to work out how a girl died. Jeremy renner plays the lead in this film and it is probably the best I have ever seen him. He totally owns the role and gives a very subtle but powerful dramatic performance that really has you caring and rooting for his character through the whole film. Elizabeth olsen plays the rookie cop in this film and she was great too, she bought a lot of strength to the role that makes her stand out on her own and not be a damsel in distress. Everybody in this film does an excellent job in there roles that are all very believable and very real. The story is pretty simple but I really liked the way the investigation was presented and especially the links to renners character that made it an emotional journey. However, my only negative for this film is in its conclusion and the big reveal which I felt was pretty weak but it doesn't hurt the movie that much. The script is great with all the dramatic beats hitting and making you truly care about the situation. But also a few little bits of humour worked in this film as well. The style of the film is a slow pace but I was invested throughout the entire film and it always kept me engaged. Plus the icy setting really helps build the tension at times. Overall I feel wind river is one of the best thrillers in recent times and if you like films like this then it is a must see film.",9,6,11,5 October 2017
Unbreakable," A Great film that was ahead of its time
","With Glass coming out tomorrow I have gone back and watched the film that started this universe Unbreakable. This film is incredibly unique as it focuses on comic books before the genre of comic book films was a big deal. The premise of the film sees a man survive a train crash unscathed, which peaks the interest of an excentric art dealer. Bruce Willis is the lead in this film and he does a really good job, he is very sombre and down in the dumps in this film but he sells his character very well. You are rooting for him in this film and it is really interesting seeing his character developing and going on a great journey. Samuel L Jackson plays his partner in this film and does such a great job, he isn't as over the top as he has been in other films but he is excentric enough to sell his character as a unique character and you are supporting his role aswell. I also thought the roles of Willis's family were portrayed very well to add to the drama in the film. The story in the film is fantastic seeing this origin story of this normal man realising that maybe he could be a superhero. It is portrayed well enough to make it seem pretty realistic and feasable even though it has supernatural elements. However, i felt like this film ends abruptly, there is a great twist, but it just ends afterwards and I was disappointed by that. The script is great with great dramatic dialogue and well placed humour that helps build up this universe. The style of the film has a great tone to it, the dark mood and incredible score really takes you to this universe. Though i cannot deny that this film has a really slow pacing about it which does hurt its overall quality in my opinion. Overall this is a great film that was quite revolutionary when it came back and should be seen especially given the state of comic book films in this day and age.",8,0,0,17 January 2019
Star Trek," A Fantastic sci-fi that really surpassed my expectations
","To begin with I am not a Star Trek fan, I have never seen a full episode of the show or any of the films until this one. I must say I am incredibly impressed with this film and I am looking forward to all things Star Trek in the future, it just makes me wish the Star Wars prequels could have been anything like this film. This film documents James T Kirk's rise to the captain of the Enterprise and his relationship with half Vulcan Half Human Spock as they attempt to take on a force from the future. Now this film mainly features Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock and both of them are marvelous in their roles and the best part of this film is their relationship and the contrast of their ideals and character. Also the chemistry of the two is something that can be capitalized on and used for this franchise to grow. Now the supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag for me with Karl Urban and Zoe Saldana thriving in their roles as Dr McCoy and Uhura but there was also some negatives for me among the group with the Russian character and Simon Pegg's character scotty are both comic relief and I just wish their was only one comic relief character but it is a bit of a shame that their is two. Another negative character is that of the Villain Nero and while his reasoning behind his actions was good his character was weak and not worthy of being the villain in this film. The story is another great positive as I mentioned the relationship between Spock and Kirk was fantastic and also the use of time travel was a smart move for the story and also to keep fans of the originals happy. The script was really good and all the characters have great lines and the delivery of the lines is also top quality. Now with this film there is a certain controversy on the lens flair style but I love the style of this film as everything looks incredibly cool and it totally fits with this reboot. I absolutely love this film and I am now really looking forward to seeing the second film and more Star Trek films.",9,0,0,4 September 2014
Fury," A great war film that attempts to encapsulate the horrors of War
","After seeing the trailer for this film it seemed like this film could be the modern day Saving Private Ryan and it is very good, however, it doesn't reach that fantastic level. This film sees a group of five soldiers in a tank in WW2 as they attempt to survive a suicide mission. Now Brad Pitt leads this film and he does really well in his role as the commander of the tank, combining the real brutal war aspect and the caring commander and he was great in this role. The supporting cast also did a really good job in their roles, I do like a comeback and Shia Labeouf is great in this film with his character having good layers to him and I hope he gets more work as he is a good actor. Logan Lerman is the character that we are meant to connect too as he has no experience in war like us and we really feel sorry for him in this situation. Michael Pena also does a good job in this role and he combines the seriousness and comedy very well and probably the best out of all the crew. The one downside the last character is an absolute douche bag, with him being unbearable at times treating Lerman's character as a piece of dirt and at times he just went too far. The story is bad with their being really no story and the acting and fact that it is in WW2 is all that they thought was necessary without giving us an interesting story. The script is really good with the war buddies dialogue feeling right for the film and feeling natural to the actors. The style of this film is awesome with the tank scenes being awesome and exciting and being the best part of the film by far. This is a great film that is definitely worth seeing.",8,3,8,30 October 2014
Fight Club," A fantastic film that is more then just fighting
","This film is considered a cult classic and it is clearly with great reason as this film looks at real life issues and it executes it fantastically. This film sees Edward Norton's character who is just an average person who meets Tyler Durden who is a completely crazy person and they start Fight Club which turns about to be much more. Edward Norton is great in the role as he truly conveys the idea that he is like us and a situation like his could end up to anybody like him and it helps make the character relatable. Then there is Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden which is awesome as he is what every person wishes they were carefree and awesome, this is probably Pitt's wackiest performance and he is fantastic. Helena Bonham Carter plays the love interest and she does a really good job and her chemistry with Norton was really good also the guy who plays Norton's boss does a good job as he is the guy we are meant to dislike as he is the one who is holding back Norton's life. But I wish some other characters were more fleshed out and had provided more which is really the only reason it doesn't get a 10. The story is quite controversial but I love it because it focuses on social themes and situations that most directors wouldn't even bother looking at, also there is a twist in the film and it is a great twist that totally changes the film. The script is great with the dialogue between Pitt and Norton being great and some very memorable dialogue that is great. The style is quite violent but it is supposed to be as the story has fighting in it and it is also great because of the social implications. Overall it is a superb film that is fantastic and definitely worth a watch.",9,0,1,11 November 2014
Darkest Hour," A great film led by a powerful performance
","This film has been heralded recently with a really strong lead performance and I have now seen darkest hour and I really enjoyed this film with a really strong lead performance. The premise of the film is set at the beginning of world War 2 and sees new prime minister Winston Churchill dealing with the grips of war. Gary Oldman plays Churchill in this film and he owns the screen throughout the entire film, he physically transformed for the role and it does give him a great presence on screen. He just delivers a truly passionate performance that provides some great moments in the film. Lily James plays his personal typist in the film and she does a good job giving some good emotion to the role and I felt her and oldmans chemistry worked very well. Ben mendehlson plays the King of England in the film and he does a good job with some of his scenes with Oldman being the most invigorating of the film. There are some good performances from the other politicians in the film and shows an interesting side that I wasn't aware of. The story as mentioned before has some interesting elements to it especially as it sees different conflicting ideas that make you see both sides of the argument. However, this film for me shares alot in similarities with last years 'Churchill' film that it was hard sometimes to get emotionally invested. The script is really good, it provides some great dramatic scenes that really build up the suspense well, also this film provides some good humour that makes these characters especially Churchill seem more human. The style of the film makes it seem very old school and with a look of the times it was set which is done well. Though, this film at times comes across as Oscar bait and over the top when it isn't necessary. Overall though this is a really enjoyable film that might give Oldman a chance at his first Oscar.",8,2,6,17 January 2018
The Maze Runner," An above average young adult film
","We have another film based on a book in the maze runner and this film is alright, even though there are problems. The premise of the film sees a young man transported to a forest with a group of other young men. As he regains his memory he wants to convince the others that they can escape. Now Dylan o brien isn't a big name actor but he does a really good job in this film. At first I wasn't sure about his character, but he really grew on me as the film progressed and was a really good dramatic character. Will poulter plays a more hostile character in the film which was completely different to other things he has done in a good way. However, the rest of the characters are paper thin and you end up not caring about him. I liked the story of the boys being stranded in this community and the conflict really worked for me. However, this is one of the weakest endings in recent memory that does nothing but attempt to set up the sequel. The script has some good powerful dramatic dialogue and scenes. But it truly lacks any humour to it which makes the characters harder to like. The style of the film looks great with some decent action scenes. However, the CGI of the creatures didn't really work for me and the lack of light made it hard to see allot of the action. Overall this is an above average film but I hope the sequel is better.",6,0,0,11 September 2015
Inglourious Basterds," another fantastic Tarantino film
","I don't think there is much of an argument that Tarantino is one of the greatest and this film is another film on a list of utterly fantastic films. This film is set in world war 2 and sees a Nazi killing American group attempt to destroy the top Nazis. While also a vengeful cinema owner looking for revenge against Nazi colonel Hans lander. Brad Pitt is the leader of the group of inglourious basterds and this is one of his best roles he combines the toughness and comedic values to create a very good lead. The rest of the cast is great as well with christophe waltz as Hans lander aka the Jew hunter was just as good as Pitt. His mix of cunning and viciousness created a top quality villain. Everybody else also does a great job the woman who plays the cinema owner does a good job, also even though brief Michael fassbender is really good in his role. The rest of the basterds do a good job as well even though their roles aren't massive. The weakest point of the film is its story while by the end of the film it is okay and the dual stories have a good climax, but the journey is not really that good and their is just a few parts to each story that are a bit pointless. Just like the majority of Tarantino films the script is superb with all dialogue hitting its que and really being the best part if the film. The style of Tarantino films is also well documented and this is no different with the style of this film being fantastic with the world war 2 setting helping. Overall this is a fantastic film that should come as no surprise thanks to the director.",9,1,2,25 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A fantastic star wars film that brings the war
","I have been the biggest fan of Star wars all my life and I was obviously incredibly excited for rogue one a star wars story and I believe this film definitely delivered. The premise of the film is set between the events of revenge of the sith and a new hope and sees a group of rebels on a mission to steal the death star plans. Felicity Jones plays jyn erso in this film as she is really good in this film. Her character is given the most depth out of anybody and you really get behind her performance and you really want her to succeed. She was a great female protagonist and I feel like she will be a great inspiration for females and a great addition to the star wars universe. Diego Luna is good in this film as the rebel officer in charge of Jones and he is good in this film. His character has a moral ambiguity to him that makes the rebel alliance way more interesting and his character way more interesting in this film. I feel like him and Jones chemistry is good together and you buy their development. Alan tudyk plays k2so the droid in this film and he steals the show in this film with a really humorous display that really works and adds allot of depth to the film. Donnie yen plays a character very heavily linked to the force and he is great in the action scenes and a very fascinating character with his friendship with wen Jiang's character working for the film. Also even though I don't usually like him I thought riz Ahmed was pretty good in this film and added allot to his character. Ben Mendelsohn plays director krennic in this film and he is a bit over the top but fully commits in this film and seems like he is happy to be in a star wars film and is a highly motivated villain. And yes Darth Vader is in this film for about 4 minutes and it is possibly the best 4 minutes in the film but just don't go in thinking he is in the film that much. The story has a real emotional feel to it an you feel the drama of trying to get these plans. The third act of the movie is amazing filled with so many emotional moments and great character depth. However, my main negative for this film is the first 30 minutes, it is very clunky and feels like just fill time to introduce these new characters and takes it time to get going and I just didn't get in to the film that quickly. The script is fantastic with really smart dialogue that mixes humour and drama incredibly well and makes you care about the situation and the characters. The style of this film is brilliant, the scale of the death star and the walkers really comes across in this film more than ever before and this is the best space battles ever put on screen. The ground battles are also incredibly raw and visceral and feels like a war zone more than any other star wars film. Overall this is a fantastic addition to the star wars franchise and definitely worth a watch especially if you are a fan it is a must see.",9,1,9,16 December 2016
Captain Marvel," A Great Fun Adventure
","This film has so much buzz about it right now and I have seen Captain Marvel and I feel like this film won't be remembered as one of the better MCU films but is still a very fun film with some really positive moments. The premise of the film sees in the 90's an alien warrior arrives on Earth and hunts down an alien threat to the planet. Brie Larson plays Captain Marvel and she does a great job in this film, the trailers make out that she is a stoic character but she really isn't, she is likeable and actually quite funny. When she does have to provide emotion she does a great job and you actually feel sorry and really root for her. The supporting cast is great to watch, Samuel L Jackson repries his role as Nick Fury, but a younger version and he is so entertaining to watch. Its nice to see this more entertaining and likeable character here when you know what he will become. Also his and Larson's chemistry is very good in this film and really carries this film. Ben Mendholson plays Talos the leader of the skrulls and this is definitley one of the better villains in the MCU. He has depth to him and even a bit of humour to him that makes him interesting and different from the traditional antagonists in this universe. Jude Law plays her Kree commander and he does a very good job in this film, his performance rises above the writing for the character which is quite basic but he does a good job. Lashana Lynch plays her friend in this film and she does a great job, she provides some real humanity to this film and a nice difference to everybody else in the film. The Story of the film is interesting as you see her trying to piece her past together and wondering where exactly it leads. Also there is a big twist in this film and it made this film way more interesting for me. But apart rom that twist this film is very predictable, and this film manages to ruin a moment the majority of fans have been waiting for years to see. The script is very good, making you care when they really want you too, also suprisingly this film is much funnier then i expected and had a little bit of a Guardians of the Galaxy feel to it which did work. The style of the film sees some good design choices for the characters and locations which were interesting. But the action scenes aren't that memorable, especially the close quarters action which I thought were poorly filmed. Overall this is a very fun film that if you are a fan of comic book movies is definitley worth a watch.",8,15,32,11 March 2019
This Is the End," Great comedy with a bunch of hilarious actors
","This film is a fun time with great comedic qualities. This story stars Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson attempting to survive the apocalypse. My favourite part of this film is that all these actors play themselves in this film and it provides hilarious moments talking about these actors lives that wouldn't be possible if these were just characters thus adding to the film. These actors realising they have made bad films just provides a great premise for this film and just makes this a laugh out loud film. However, this film has a few plot holes but this is a Seth Rogen comedy and this narrative wasn't bad for a comedy that I was expecting with many themes looked at. Go see this film if you can accept stylised violence and film references used throughout this hilarious 2 hours.",8,0,4,18 March 2014
Iron Man 2," an okay film that is nowhere near the level of the original
","When talking about the marvel cinematic universe it is seen in a highly positive light because of the high standard. But this film is really not one of the best and in fact gets a lot of criticism. This story sees tony stark against the government to keep his iron man suits while also encountering an old enemy that has the power to destroy iron man. Now Robert Downey jnr is great as tony stark and this film is no different, I do believe this is the weakest of his performances as the character but he is still great and provides everything that the character should be. The supporting cast is also top notch and they do a really good job in this film, Gwyneth paltrow stars as pepper Potts and she does a great job. Her chemistry with stark is excellent and is easily the best relationship in super hero films. There was a lot of controversy about don Cheadle being James Rhodes but he also did a superb job and his chemistry with Downey is a key part if the film and played up well. Now I think Scarlett Johansson did a good job in her role and her character provides a lot of mystery and intrigue that helped her character. A fantastic performance was definitely delivered by Sam Rockwell as Starks adversary Justin hammer. He was funny and entertaining while being a menace and did a really great job and shows just how good an actor he is. The story is where this film falls apart though, this film has like 5 major stories and it is just too much in too little time and it just makes this film bloated and cluttered. The script was okay with the actors doing a good job with the dialogue, however, there was just a ridiculous amount of comedy when it wasn't needed and the drama was also lost. This hurts the style of the film with the mix of comedy and style not working. But this is an iron man film and the action is awesome and the style of iron man is really cool. This film isn't that strong but it has some positives about it and is not a bad film.",6,1,3,15 October 2014
Alien: Resurrection," A truly terrible film that in my opinion killed the franchise
","My goodness I thought alien 3 was bad but boy alien resurrection is one of the worst films I have ever seen and it is ironic that a film called Resurrection truly killed this franchise for a while. The premise of the film sees 200 years after alien 3 Ripley is found and cloned including the alien inside of her. Her and a team of mercenaries attempt to escape a facility fro! These cloned xenomorphes. Sigourney weaver legitimately only returned as Ripley for this film because she was offered a ridiculous amount of money. It clearly shows, as she gives a pretty bad performance in this film and I hated the fact that they decided to use her character in this film after the events of the previous film. The supporting cast at least has some recognisable faces in it, Winona Ryder plays call and she is just ridiculously bland in this movie. She adds very little to her character and you really won't care about her or anybody else in this movie. Ron perlman is in this film and he does add a little bit of charisma and entertainment but even he is a joke in this film and just spouts stupid one liners. The rest of the cast are just cliché and dull which will make you check out. The story in this film has absolutely nothing to it, it feels like a really bad pale imitation of alien mixed with a bit of alien 3 and there is nothing unique here which makes you think why was this film even made. The script has nothing really special to it and absolutely nothing memorable to it whatsoever which is poor when you consider the great alien films. The style of the film is pretty awful, the action scenes are really poorly filmed and even though it is better then alien 3 I really didn't like the design of the aliens in this film especially towards the end of the film. Overall this film is a total travesty and shouldn't exist, try to avoid this film at all cost and look forward to alien covenant.",1,1,3,7 May 2017
World War Z," Great Zombie apocalypse film
",This film is billed as a zombie apocalypse film and it succeeds in being exactly that which is the reason I like it so much. Brad Pitt is hit with this Zombie Apocalypse that has taken over the whole world and he has to attempt to find a vaccine to stop this apocalypse. His performance is great and he is the main guy that you have to care about because the film doesn't really focus on anybody else. His family and partners in the film are okay but you don't really care what happens to them throughout the film. The best part of this film is of course the zombies these flesh eating creatures move faster then traditional zombies. Some of the crazy shots with the zombies are breath-taking and the film never really gets better after these encounters. This film's climax is tense without really any violence and that is the key for this film and is so tense to watch. This isn't going to win any Oscars but it is a fun zombie film that I enjoyed a lot.,8,1,2,20 March 2014
Passengers," An average space survival film
","I like both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence so I had some excitement for this film but it ended up being a huge disappointment. The premise of the film sees a group of people on a ship to a new planet when one of the passengers wakes up and things start to go wrong. Chris Pratt is the main character in this film, no matter what the trailers say and he is brilliant in this film. He is easily the best part of this film and gives his usual humorous performance but adds a large amount of dramatic depth to his character that really worked for the film. Jennifer Lawrence plays aurora in this film and she does a good job in the film, I thought her and Pratt had good chemistry in the film and her character does get more interesting as the film progresses. I did find her character a little annoying at first but she grew on me as the film progressed. Michael sheen plays Arthur the android bartender and he is really good in this film providing allot of fun moments and good banter with the other two characters. But then there are some wasted characters such as Laurence fishburne and Andy Garcia who really add absolutely nothing To this film. The story both first half of the film sees Pratt's character Jim surviving on the ship by himself and I really liked seeing him survive and go through the cool parts of he ship. However, once Jennifer Lawrence character came into the film it slowed down allot and you feel like the film is really dragging with nothing that interesting. The script is incredibly bland though, there is just not enough uniqueness to it or enough for you to care about it. The style of the film has good special effects and a good thriller style towards the end of the film. But it feels like a very long film that just doesn't have enough substance in it. Overall this is an average film that doesn't have much uniqueness to it and it isn't worth a watch.",5,15,46,21 December 2016
Zootopia," Another fantastic addition to the Disney empire
","I have heard allot of good things about this film so before the end of 2016 i decided i had to watch Zootropolis and i really enjoyed this film. the premise of this film sees a rookie bunny detective team up with a sly fox con artist to uncover a conspiracy. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Judy Hopps in this film and she is great, she is such a hopeful character but flawed which makes her a character that i rooted for and believed in throughout the film. Her character develops really well in this film and you see her progression. Jason Bateman plays Nick Wilde in this film and he is easily the coolest fox in film history and one of the best characters of 2016. He has so much charisma in this film and you see this slik fox's character develop and as you learn more about his character you end up caring about him so much and their chemistry together really carries this film. Idris Elba plays juddy's police captain and he brings allot of laughs to this film and also brings some great dramatic scenes in the film. Jk simmons plays the mayor and even though his role isn't huge he revels in the character and he gives a fun performance. The story has allot of comparisons to real life social implications, it is great to see these real life issues being brought up in a family film such as this. The film also has a great message that is heavily emphasized in the film. However, I did find the third act of the story to be allot less interesting and i just didn't get into the last 30 mins as much mainly because of the obvious and weak villain reveal. The script has great funny dialogue in it that will have you laughing but also some great drama being used in the film. Its a very heartfelt script with allot of great moments and dialogue. The style of the film is fantastic with great creature design and you see these animals act like humans but also keep their characteristics and it worked so well. Overall this is one of the best animated films i have seen in the last few years and i believe this is a must watch for the whole family.",9,5,9,28 December 2016
42," A great biography that documents this historic life well
","I do enjoy biopic films and this film is all about Jackie Robinson who is the first black baseball player and how he struggled to succeed in this. To my delight this was a great movie that's hope becomes available to own in the UK. The premise sees a baseball manager want to win the world series so he wants to get the first black baseball player and the film documents the struggles that Jackie Robinson grows through to become a baseball player. Now Chadwick boseman plays Jackie Robinson and he does a great job in bringing this legend to life. He wasn't just a push over and you really felt sorry for him as he was put in these hard to watch scenarios. You really care about Jackie Robinson and you really want to cheer for him to succeed. But probably the best performance in this film is Harrison Ford as his manager and I think there should have been the conversation about whether he deserved an Oscar nomination. He was great and you really felt like he cared about this character and that he really cared about Jackie Robinson becoming a success and it really adds something to the film. Jackie Robinson's wife does a great job as well as all the players and coaches in the film as you truly feel the way Robinson does in all these interactions. The story is really good, it focuses on the most important part of Robinson's life and you truly feel like the baseball field is where he can thrive. There is allot of tension in this film obviously due to the time period and it really works and make you truly root for Jackie Robinson. The script is okay with some well done dramatic dialogue, however, when some of the scenes get heated I think more realistic dialogue and occasional swearing could have made the scene more volatile. The style is alright with the baseball scenes being really interesting and cool but I do think the film could have done with more baseball scenes and really emphasised that the baseball field is where Jackie Robinson thrives. If you are interested in this film at all then you should see it and I hope it comes to the UK so I can get it on blu Ray.",8,0,0,30 July 2015
Shaun of the Dead," a fantastic zombie film that is now a cult hit
","At least here in Britain this film is seen as a coming of age film, meaning if you haven't seen this film you can't really comment on zombie films. This film sees Shaun a guy contempt with his boring average life going to the pub with his beat friend ed. However, when a zombie apocalypse hits town Shaun, ed and a few others must attempt to survive in their favourite pub the Winchester. Now I believe Simon pegg is a great comedic actor and in this film he truly proves it, he is the perfect person to play Shaun. He is funny, he is relatable and sometimes heroic and exactly what a film like this truly needs. Nick frost is hear as usual as his best friend ed and he also does a really good job, obviously the chemistry between pegg and frost is insane and it truly carries the film. I thought the actress who played Shaun's girlfriend did a good job as well with some really good dialogue, but the rest of the characters were pretty paper thin and not interesting at all. Now this is your typical zombie apocalypse, but, it does have a good story of a character who is down and average rise up and become a hero and I liked it a lot. Also I liked the way that the story made out that the zombies represent every day life and that was a good stylistic option. There is some plot points just shoehorned into the film but I forgave this because of the overall story with Shaun. The script is just excellent with the dialogue being really quick and snappy and also the jokes didn't feel forced and they flowed incredibly well into the narrative where there was a few heartfelt moments. Obviously to me the style is really cool as the film is completely British and I liked the setting and also the way the zombies acted was cool. Overall I think Shaun of the dead is fantastic and it should be seen by all.",9,0,2,15 October 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A solid film but disappointing after the original pirates
","The first pirates film is just so good that it was always going to be a worry if this film could live up to the original and unfortunately it doesn't, but it is still a fun film to watch. This film starts with Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner facing death for their association with Jack Sparrow in the first film. The only way to save them is for will and Elizabeth to reunite with Sparrow to find the dead mans chest. Now in the lead Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is fantastic like he is in the majority of this franchise and he continues this in this film. I also thought even not as good as Barbosa, Davey Jones was a pretty good villain and looked the way I would imagine Davey Jones to look and act. But for other supporting characters like Elizabeth, Will and Bootstrap Bill I thought they were just annoying and winey in this film compared to the good overall performances in the first film. The story is also mixed bag similar to the original as for the opening exchanges it seems to be really jarring and all over the place especially with the scenes with the pelogostos. But as the story progresses it gets more interesting as I did like the different people and their different reasons for wanting the chest. The script just like the characters is good when it comes to Jack Sparrow but everybody else seems a bit wooden with their delivery and lack of emotion a lot of the time. Obviously with the crew of The Flying Dutchman and The Kraken the visuals are phenomenal in this film and is a great feature in all the pirates films. Now even though it wasn't as good as I wanted it was still okay and there will be more hopefully better pirates films.",6,0,1,2 July 2014
Rocky V," A poor rocky film that shouldn't have happened
","And I have finally seen rocky 5 and I gotta say this is easily the worst rocky movie. The premise of this film sees rocky forced to retire so he ends up training a protégé so he can have a new lease on life. Meanwhile, his son struggles in school. Now Sylvester Stallone is great in this film and easilly the best part of this film. I actually believed that he wanted to get back in the ring and I saw the pain in his character. However, I didn't like anybody else in this film, whether it was returning characters such as Adrian because they didn't add anything to the film. Also I thought his son was annoying throughout the film. I also didn't feel like Tommy gunn was a particular strong character. The story was just all over the place. Whether it was the Stallone and gunn relationship which had a really forced conclusion that I didn't like. Also I hated the sins story arc and felt it was a stupid part of the film. The script had some decent dramatic dialogue but the humour just want there like it had been in previous films. The style wasn't good in this film there is actually no real boxing in a rocky film and no rocky training montage. Overall this is a poor entry to rocky that you don't need to see.",3,1,2,16 October 2015
Argo," Fantastic real life story
","Going into this film I wasn't truly sure what I expected. This film though was a pleasant surprise instead of being the traditional CIA agent beating up terrorists action film this is a film based on its realism and deeply emotional narrative. Ben Affleck is absolutely superb as both the protagonist and the director of this film and everything Affleck seems to touch at the moment turns to gold. This film got huge plaudits from the critics and this film has just a bit of everything in it to create a real emotional attachment to these characters in this situation and create the huge tension towards the end of the film. The fact that this was based on a true story helps the narrative really hit hard on the terrible acts occurring in the film, there is also some cool references to other sci-fi films which are enjoyable. Overall, this film only has a few slow scenes also with the fact in my opinion Affleck's character's relationship with his family isn't explored enough to really care about it. But this film is fantastic and it is a must see in my opinion for anybody.",9,0,2,17 February 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The best pirate film of all time
","This film is one of those that changed the landscape for film and because of its success the pirate genre is nothing but The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The story sees the undead crew of the Black pearl attempt to lift their curse by kidnapping the governors daughter Elizabeth Swann and her possessions. So old friend Will Turner and the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow attempt to rescue her for their own needs. For starters Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow has become a legendary partnership and the performance is phenomenal and unfortunately for Depp it is so good and legendary it has consumed his acting career, but in this film he is amazing. The supporting class is great as well Keira Knightly as Elizabeth was a good choice as she is passive because of her status and also heroic and aggressive when she needs to be, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner was another great choice as he is a great foil for Sparrow and is possibly the character to connect with most. Whereas Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa is a fantastic Villain and is truly evil and a great fit and foil for Sparrow. Now the one weakness possibly in this film is that the story is quite basic and predictable as it goes but this isn't a huge detriment to the film but stops it from being a 10. The script is phenomenal especially with Jack sparrow but everybody truly gets a moment to shine. The style is also really good with the epic pirates theme song, the stylised awesome fights and the undead visuals. However, the style of some of the comedy is off a little bit but not enough to take down the overall quality of the film as this is a truly fantastic film that will be tough to better for pirate films.",9,0,1,30 June 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," How to do a sequel right and an absolutely fantastic film
","I think the first JJ Abrams is one of the biggest surprises I have seen in a while for how good it is and this film is just as good as that film. Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew attempt to capture an ancient warrior threatening them called Khan. Just like the first film this film is co-led by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto and they both do superb jobs with Kirk being a captain who is relatable and charismatic to lead the crew. Spock is not relatable but a cool character who parallels Kirk really well which creates a good dynamic between the two. The side characters are all great too and this film is stolen by one man and one man only Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. He is absolutely superb from his look to his voice and dialogue to his action scenes making him the coolest character in Star Trek and I really hope we see him again in the future. Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban and Simon Pegg are also great in their roles returning from the first film as good as then. The story is okay but it can be a bit confusing but there is also some great instances of story telling as well. The script and dialogue between everyone is great with Cumberbatch nailing all of his lines but also everybody else having great lines. Before seeing the film you would know that the style of the film would be great and it is as expected. This is a fantastic film and with Abrams moving to Star Wars it excites me that and also with these two fantastic films I am looking forward to Star Trek 3.",9,2,4,12 September 2014
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," A Good Silly Film
","This film hit Netflix on Friday and being British I know what The Eurovision Song Contest is so I decided to watch this film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two Icelandic Musicians given the opportunity to represent their country in The Eurovision Song Contest and attempt to achieve their dreams.
Main Character
Rachel McAdams plays one of the main characters here and I thought she was really good here. She is the character that I cared about the most here and her journey is the most interesting part of the film. She is a great actress and even though this film doesn't take itself too seriously she tries too at times. Will Ferrell plays her partner and I thought he was fine here, this is nowhere near his strongest performance but he does have some funny moments and even though his story arc is cliche it does work for the film.The two's chemistry is good and they bounce off of each other well, which is good as it is the part of the film that you have to be invested in.
Supporting Characters
Dan Stevens is one of the best actors going around today and for me he was the standout for this film. He is uber charismatic and really balances on the borderline of being super cool or super annoying but he nails it and oozes style in every scene he is in. Pierce Brosnan plays Ferrel's dad and he is good here, again he isn't the most interesting part of the film but for the role he has to do he does it effectivley. Everybody else also does good jobs and it is nice to see Graham Norton have his real life role here.
Story
The story here is pretty basic, but the chemistry between the two leads is really good plus it is great seeing the song contest being played out in all of it's glory. But there is this side arc involving the Icelandic government that had potential but it feels really out of place. Plus as I have mentioned there are parts of the film that are very generic leading to it being a predictable film.
Script
The script has some funny moments in it and some nice drama to it. But there just aren't enough of those funny moments, I am pretty sure this film is trying to be a comedy but it isn't funny enough to be a great comedy unfortunately.
Style
The style of this film is absurd, you see just how crazy Eurovision is, and what is funny is that this film doesn't even make it much crazier then it is in real life. The song sequences are fantastic, they feel grand on scale and feel epic in nature. But the issue is that you can tell that every actor is lipsyncing and it does take you out of what is happening. Also I felt like the last act is rushed a little bit and it leads to a pretty abrupt ending.
Overall
Overall, I feel like this is a very entertaining film, I think if you know little about Eurovision this might not be a film for you. But if you know about the show then this is a fun if not flawed experience that could be worth a watch.",7,7,12,29 June 2020
Balls of Fury," About what you would expect for this film
","Now I do enjoy this film to a certain extent but due to a lot of things it is just distinctly average and really fails to push through to the levels of other comedies like Anchorman or Dodgeball. Now the guy that they got to play Randy Daytona in this film I have not heard of now or ever but he is functional in this film and has some good funny moments but it does leave you with the wish that somebody of Jack Black or Will Ferrell's calibre had been chosen to play the role. The side characters are really good with Christopher Walken totally stealing his scenes and having the best and most outrageous lines in the film, also his wardrobe is awesome in this film. George Lopez is a good addition with some good lines even though his character is a bit simple. The trainer and love interest are good as well even though you don't buy the romance at all she still is cool and the trainer has some funny lines. The story is just lazy it is so basic it is unreal and it doesn't have any real interesting dynamics and it is definitely not one of the positives of the film which can take away from the film. The script is like what you would expect solid though some of the lines aren't really that good and it doesn't hit like it should. The style is a mixed bag as the costumes for some of the characters are pretty cool but it is so stereotypical and a bit insulting with its interpretation that doesn't really add to the film. Overall Balls of Fury is an average film that will give a couple of laughs.",5,0,0,12 August 2014
Ted," A great comedy that will be remembered
",Now I love Family Guy and I think Seth MacFarlane is a creative genius so when this film was announced and that he was voicing Ted I knew that this film was going to be a hit and boy was I right. This premise sees an 8 year old boy wish his teddy was alive and it obviously does. Now at 35 years old he is still with Ted and starts to realise that Ted may be holding him back. Now the character of Ted is just awesome and McFarlane's voice was perfect to truly encapsulate this raunchy teddy bear that has some of the best one liners ever. The supporting cast was really good too with Mark Walhberg delivering a really funny performance with his chemistry with the teddy bear and helping really add to the film. Mila Kunis was also good in the film with her dialogue being funny and her chemistry with Walhberg being good too. Giovanni Ribisi also had a good performance as the bad guy and added a lot to the film. The one I didn't really like was Kunis boss who I thought didn't have to be in the film at all. The story is okay with the premise being crazy but I think some of the dramatic moments did work and added to the film but a lot of the film is just random scenes and doesn't add anything to the film. The script is fantastic with all dialogue working and all the lines especially from Ted being hilarious. The style is okay with some of the crazy aspects working but also some of it also seeming just too ridiculous to take seriously. Overall this is a hilarious film that if you are not offended easily is definitely worth a watch.,8,0,1,18 December 2014
Knives Out," A Fantastic Mystery Film
","This film has an absolutley fantastic cast in it so I needed to see this film, snd this film was an old fashioned fantastic mystery film. The premise of the film sees an old matriach commit suicide and every member of the family is a suspect from a world famous detective who is on the hunt. Ana De Armas plays the lead in this film and she did a really good job in this film, she is really likeable and you truly care about her character. She is our view into this crazy situation and she is easily the relatable character of the film. Daniel Craig plays the main detective in the film and he does a great job, he plays the detective very well and he is a very interesting character in this film. Jaime Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon & Chris Evans play members of the family and they all do great jobs in the film, they all play there characters very well and they are full of intrigue and mystery. The story has tonnes of twists and turns which really works for the is film, it does keep you thinking, however, I do believe that the reveal is a bit easy to predict which I did but that is literally the only negative I can find with this film. The script is great, a truly fantastic mix of humour and drama, I was laughing when I was meant too and I was feeling the emotion when required. The style of the film moves very quickly and you have to pay attention all the way through to maximise your enjoyment of the film. Overall this is a fantastic film and one that will keep you invested throughout.",9,2,6,10 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," A Fantastic film that rivals the best comic book films
","This was the second Spider Man film and after the original's huge success this film had to deliver and I believe it really did. This film starts off with Peter Parker enjoying his life as Spider Man but because of problems from the past movies and a new super villain created it tests him to his limits. Now I believe Tobey Maguire is a great Peter Parker/Spider Man and this is the film where he truly gives his best performance as the character as you truly feel sorry for his character at points and also that he is up for the responsibility. In all three films I do not like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane she just seems annoying and selfish and in real life I would never be interested in her and she just seems like an annoyance to Peter. I do like James Franco as Harry Osborne in this film as his character goes through a lot and changes throughout but the best performances are by Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson. I do not see Jk as anything other then this role because he is an absolute show stealer in every film in the trilogy. Whereas, Doc Ock is my favourite villain out of the films because Molina truly shows this twisted character that isn't truly evil but still a threat. The Story makes logical sense from the past film and even though this film has a few story arcs they all are good and well executed. The script is good overall but is quite cheesy throughout and the cheesiness of this film and the slow pace is what stops it from being an epic film. The style is fantastic and it looks marvellous as it truly should which adds to the overall quality. Overall this is the best Spider Man film ever and will take some beating.",9,4,6,18 June 2014
The Irishman," A Great Ganster Classic
","So it is a bit late, but you know the saying better late then never, so this is my review for easilly Netfilx's biggest project to date The Irishman. The premise of the film documents the life of a gangster as he tells the audience his life story of how he grew in the criminal Underworld.
Main Character
Robert De Niro plays the lead character in this film and he does a really good job in the film, you can tell he really cared about this role and it felt like a role that fit him very well. After this performance and his performance in Joker I think it is fair to say that De Niro is back on form and taking roles he actually cares about. At first the de ageing CGI distracted me but you get used to it as the film progresses and it fits De Niro as lets face it he has always looked the same pretty much.
Supporting Characters
Al Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa in this film and he does a really good job, he is very charismatic and charming in his role, his and De Niro have really good chemistry together and you care about their relationship in the film and he is probably the most interesting character in the film. Joe Pesci plays the Mob Boss in this film and he is also great in this film, again he and De Niro have great chemistry in the film and you do care about their relationship and seeing these three gentleman give great performances is a very welcome sign indeed. There is also some other smaller but great roles such as Ray Romano, Stephen Graham and Bobby Cannavalle who aren't huge parts of the film but they add a bit of class and top quality performances in these roles.
Story
The story is interesting as it documents this gang culture and the different inner workings of what is going on in higher society in this time period. If I am honest this films story is further enhanced by the performers then the actual plot. This film's plot jumps over multiple time periods and it can become a bit convoluted and you are introduced to lots of characters, some who just aren't given enough backstory for you to care about them. Plus this film has easily 30 minutes on there that just isn't necessary and it makes this film feel more indulgent then it could have been.
Script
The dialogue in most Martin Scorsese films is excellent filled with smart and witty dialogue to make you feel like these are real people even though they are in ridiculous scenarios. The drama especially between the main three characters feels very real, like they are real friends and their relationships do feel very real. The dry humour also works and again makes this film feel quite a bit funnier then it had any right to be.
Style
The style in this film has a really cool gangster feel to it that fits the performers and the director incredibly well and you can tell they are very passionate about how this movie should be made. Also as mentioned before there is de-ageing CGI in this movie and for me it was used well and wasn't distracting to me at all. However, to the big thing about this film is that it is 3 Hours and 30 Minutes long which is absurd for any movie even if the quality of the movie is high. This film definitley drags along and you kind of just wait for the ending to come.
Overall
This film is another great addition to the gangster genre and if you want to watch a superbly acted but long film then this is a film for you, but just remember that you cannot watch this casually and must fully invest in it.",8,1,2,8 January 2020
Point Break," A really bad reboot that is a shadow of its former friend
","I am a huge fan of the original point break made in 1991 and now I have seen the 2016 reboot and boy this is one of the worst films of the year and one of the worst reboots ever. The premise of the film sees a young up and coming FBI agent looking to infiltrate a gang of extreme athletes who may also be criminals. Luke bracey plays johnny Utah in this film and this is potentially one of the most stoic characters of the year and you will not care about him at all. His character is just so uninteresting that it really kills every scene that he is involved in. Edgar Ramirez plays bowdie in this film and just like bracey he is very stoic and isn't an interesting character like his previous incarnation. He is just your generic bad guy that Doesn't have any of the depth to him that you want him too. Also their chemistry Together just doesn't work and you just really do not buy it at all. The rest of bowdies crew were just as boring as he was and you won't care about there relationships with Utah as the film develops. The only performances I liked were ray winstone and Utah's police captain who I thought were both decent additions but they aren't given enough to do in this film for you to really care. The story is completely non existent, it is less compelling because the characters and their relationships are so dull and unbelievable that you will not care about anybody or anything in the film. The script has absolutely no depth to it and none of the dialogue was gripping in anyway. The style had some really cool extreme sports that are really well filmed but I don't need to watch this film to watch to watch good extreme sports so it needs to do more an the film just doesn't do anything more. Overall this film is definitely not worth a watch and go and watch the original point break because it is so good.",2,11,13,10 December 2016
127 Hours," A great dramatic true tale
","I have heard so much about this film and its story and now I have finally seen it and I thought it was great. The premise sees a thrillseeker trapped in a canyon with a boulder trapping his arm as he tries to survive and possibly escape. James franco plays aron the guy who is trapped and my goodness is he brilliant in this film. Giving the best performance of his career he truly encapsulates the pain that this man goes through both physically and mentally as he is trapped in this situation. But his character just feels so real when he uses his humour to deflect the problem, it just makes him very relatable as a person. Kate mara also does a decent job in her small role but this is definitely Franco's film. The story is really intense and as the story progresses you see this man becoming more and more helpless to his situation and its enthralling. The script has some good dramatic moments and dialogue its just some of the situations aren't that interesting to me and left me a bit bored. The style is really powerful and intense with you feeling like you are with franco throughout the film which really works. However, there were a few stylistic decisions taken by danny boyle that I wasn't a huge fan of because it takes you out of the intense situation. Overall this is a great film that is worth at least one viewing.",8,0,1,7 May 2016
Batman Returns," A Solid sequel that has Tim Burton's fingerprints all over it
",After the success of the original Batman it was clear that the studio decided to give Tim Burton much more creative control and thus why we get this film. This film sees Batman attempting to stop businessman Max Shreck's attempts to make The Penguin the Mayor of Gotham also while interacting with another new Villain Catwoman. Now Michael Keaton reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and once again he puts in a wonderful performance. Michelle Pfeifer is also fantastic as Catwoman she is a good mix of sexy and dangerous and really adds to the film. Now Danny DeVito was perfect for this Penguin and he is totally gross throughout the character really is disgusting which is what it was meant to be. Christopher Walken as Max Shreck was a great performance as the lesser villain in this film and he is truly the worse human possible. Now one negative like both the Burton's and Schumacher Batman films is the role of Commissioner Gordon his character is just a waste of space and not needed throughout any of these films and this upsets me after seeing what Christopher Nolan has done with the character. The story is nothing special either the motivations of both The Penguin and Catwoman aren't revealed till the very end and this really shows that the story wasn't a true priority apart from Shreck's story. The script was decent but nothing special and it doesn't really seem that it was a problem. The style of the film was truly a mixed bag though the style of the main characters and this Christmassy Gotham which is cool. But the Burton costumes created are rubbish and they really make it feel like a cartoon at times. The soundtrack is great and helps add the tension. This film is decent but with more mistakes then the first Batman.,7,3,8,10 July 2014
Blade," A Great dark comic book film
","Blade is really a different comic book film to every other comic book film there has been and that I believe is why Blade is such a good film. The film stars Blade a half Human Half Vampire as he tries to control his thirst for blood and also attempts to stop the end of the world. Wesley Snipes is Blade and was the perfect person to play Blade and will always be Blade. Add to that good side characters and a good villain which does help make this film seem more then just an average film. There is a lot of stylised violence in this film some good and some bad for this film but another big positive is the action, this action is some of the best filmed action out there and it truly sells just how cool a character Blade really is. A few slow parts aside this film is fun, sometimes cheesy and action heavy which I thoroughly enjoyed.",8,1,2,29 April 2014
Creed," A fantastic film that knows its legacy
","I am a big fan of the rocky films and now I have finally had the chance to see creed and I loved it. The premise of the film sees adonis johnson the illegitimate son of apollo creed try to get rocky balboa to try and train him to be a fighter like his father. Michael b jordan plays adonis and he does an excellent job in this film. He sold the physicality of the role but also made donnie a really likable character that you wanted to root for. But the biggest surprise in this film has to be the amazing return by Sylvester stallone as rocky balboa. He is awesome in this film and his chemistry with jordan is off the charts good. Vanessa thompson was really good as donnies love interest Bianca because she had some character to her and they both worked together well. Even tony bellew the boxer as the opponent was pretty good and had a pretty decent background about him. The story is really powerful as you see adonis and rocky try to overcome their struggles together and its emotional. By the end of the film you are really rooting for them. Unfortunately there is a story arc in the middle of the film that I felt was a little unnecessary and weighed the film down. The script is really good using allot of powerful drama but also subtle comedy that worked for the film. The style was brilliant, you truly feel like your in Philadelphia with rocky and adonis. The boxing scenes are the best ever put on the big screen, the cinematography for the fights is amazing. The sound of the hits really works as well plus the score is brilliant. Overall this is a fantastic movie that should be seen if you appreciate good films.",9,0,2,29 January 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," An average film that is hugely disappointing
",With all three x men films it was clear that Wolverine was the main character and that with this Fox thought it was a good idea to do a prequel for their loved character and even though I don't believe this film is as bad as some suggest it is not as good as other x men films by far. This film looks to Logan's past and history with William Stryker and Sabertooth. Now this film has some good parts with the extreme action between Wolverine and Sabertooth and the performances of Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber. There are also the introduction of great X-men characters such as Gambit and a horrific version of Deadpool. The main negatives is just the dialogue and the film just feels choppy and sloppy throughout plus it like most of the x-men films is inconsistent with the other X men films which just feels lazy. The action is good Wolverine fun but that is about the only positive in this dull action film.,5,2,3,15 April 2014
Hot Fuzz," A truly epic buddy cop film
","Before going to see Edgar wrights new film baby driver I had to rewatch probably my favourite film of his witch is hot fuzz. The premise of the film sees an exceptional police officer transferred from London to a little village where he attempts to work out why the crime rate is so low. Simon pegg plays the lead in this film and he is excellent in this film, he was the perfect person to play this by the numbers police officer and it is truly great to see his character develop with the film and watch him just have so much fun in the role. Nic frost is also in this film playing his partner and he owns his role as well, there chemistry is absolutely brilliant and is really the driving force in this film. Seeing there friendship grow is great and shows just how good both of these performers are especially together. Timothy Dalton is in this film as a supermarket owner and you can tell he is having so much fun in the role, he plays up his sleezy persona and he seems to be having a blast in this film. Jim broadbent plays the police inspector in this film an he is great, he also plays up his role well and I found him one of the more interesting characters in this film. Also credit has to go to the whole police force who were all really funny in this film and bounced off each other very well. The story has just a really fun feel about it as you see pegg try and work out what this village is all about. As the film progresses there are more twists and turns that work and do come as a surprise which leads to a very memorable third act. The script has so many great lines, the humour is so crisp and hilarious that it makes all these characters fun to watch. But also the drama when used is really good as well. The style of the film plays up all the action clichés but it works to add to the humour in this film. The action scenes are really fun to watch and with the style used makes it a truly memorable style. Overall this is a truly epic film that needs to be seen especially if you love Shaun of the dead and the worlds end like I do.",10,1,1,3 July 2017
Just Go with It," A below average Comedy that is pretty bland
","I like a good comedy and there is a few big stars in this film so I decided to watch just go with it and this film didn't do much to entertain but it isn't one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. In this film a man lies to his girlfriend that he is a divorced family man so he recruits his assistant and her kids to pose as his family. Adam Sandler has been around for years now and I think he is a talented actor and he actually does provide a bit of depth to his character in this film. You buy the chemistry between him and Jennifer aniston and you do slightly care about it and see his character develop throughout the film. But at times he becomes the Sandler from grown ups with just over the top moments and humour that just doesn't land. Jennifer aniston plays his fake wife and he does a decent job in this film and as mentioned before she works really well with Sandler. Her character was pretty likable even if she was a little cliché. Everybody else in this film is completely worthless and totally unfunny, whether it is Sandler's girlfriend or anistons kids or Nicole Kidman's character who were all incredibly annoying and not worth caring about. This film's story is totally cliché, from the synopsis you can guess the entire plot with no twists at all. But this film has got quite a bit of heart to it and I liked the overall message of this film. The script has some decent drama and humour that will make you chuckle, but there is allot of more cringeworthy dialogue that makes you question if the guys who wrote this film cared at all. The style of the film has been done plenty of times and the humour just doesn't always work and the style of this film feels really cheap and not in the good way. Overall this film is very forgetful and definitely not worth a watch.",4,1,1,5 December 2016
Spotlight," An Epic really powerful film
","This film won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2016 and I have been told to watch Spotlight ever since and I have now had the chance to do this and this is truly one of the best and one of the most important films I have ever seen. The premise of this film sees a group of Boston reporters looking into possible misdoings from priests at the Catholic Church. The main star in this film is that of Mark Ruffalo and this is probably the best I have ever seen him, he sinks his teeth into this role and you can really believe that he is a journalist. It's also fascinating seeing his characters journey throughout the film and you just want to root for him all the way through. The rest of the cast is amazing too, Michael Keaton plays the head of the team and he continues his career renaissance by delivering a great performance full of depth and intrigue. Rachel McAdams is a great actress and she totally nails it in this film, her character has a good story in the film and it's great to see her given as important a role in this film as the male reporters in the story. Liev Schreiber is known for playing very powerful physical performances but he plays the new head of the globe and he gave a truly unique great performance that I wasn't sure that he was capable of. Other great performances come from Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, John Slattery and Jamey Sheridan who add so much to their smaller roles and really gave this film an overall sense of realism. The story of this film is so interesting with this group of journalists going on a hunt for this story. It deals with a ton of sensitive and important moments but it kept me interested and intrigued throughout. The script deals with its dramatic dialogue very respectfully and appropriately which makes it comes across as quite naturally. Also the little bits of humour made these characters feel like real people and not just characters that are in a movie. The style of the film is so tense and on edge that you don't know what the next twist is going to be and it always keeps you on your toes. Overall this is truly a special film that I feel should be seen by everybody to truly appreciate what films are about.",10,1,1,13 August 2018
Terminator Salvation," A poor cash grab
","I am getting the chance to see terminator genysis tonight so I finally have to review the most recent terminator film and that is terminator salvation. Set in the year 2018 after judgement day, John Connor and the resistance attempt to find a way to stop skynet in the war. While a mysterious criminal called Marcus Wright meets Kyle Reese and they have their own reason to track down Connor. Christian bale was cast as John Connor and this was a complete mixed bag. This performance was pretty close to when he played Batman in the dark knight and sometimes it seems he is just growling and shouting for no reason in this film in his very noticeable batman voice. This does kind of work though for the character of John Connor and there are times when his character is expanded and looked at that works for the film. Now I have never been a fan of Sam Worthington and his character in this film is not a likable guy and he never grew on me once throughout the film and took away from the film. The girl that meets Marcus Wright is a terrible actress and she could and should have been written out of the film because you don't care about their romance and it such an insignificant part of the film. Helena Bonham Carter is in the film and even though she is a key part of the film she is barely in the film and she never got a chance to develop like she should have done. The one pretty good performance in this film is Anton yelchin as Kyle reese, I thought he nailed the damage of the character and the layers that the character should have. The story is just complete garbage and it actually goes quite a way to take away from the other films. The character development just isn't there, there are two stories where they could have easily made it one and a romance that you really just won't care about. The script is utterly terrible also the dialogue is just so dull and ridiculous that really doesn't help these characters. And no the odd reference to the other films does not make good dialogue. There are some fun action scenes that are directed well and look good, but then there are some awful over cgi based action scenes that really hurt the movie. Overall this is another really poor terminator film and I'm really hoping this franchise gets the film it deserves in genesyis.",3,3,8,3 July 2015
Aquaman," A Great Unique comic book film
","I have been anticipating this film for a long time and now Aquaman has come and I thought this was a great film that hopefully gets the DC Universe back on its feet. The premise of the film sees Arthur Curry having to travel to Atlantis to stop his half brother from waging a war on the surface world. Jason Mamoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman and I think he is really great in this film, he is very charismatic in this film and has a real presence about him. His character has alot of development and depth added to him in this film that improve from his previous appearance in Justice League. The supporting cast all do a great job aswell, Amber Heard plays Mera and she is a much betetr character here then she was in her scene in Justice League. She was more bright and interesting in this film with a unique personality that really worked with her and Mamoa's chemistry that was great to watch on screen. Patrick Wilson plays Orm/ Ocean Master and he was a great villain for this film, he has got similarities to Loki and Killmonger but I thought he did a good job in this film to give the audience a possibly layered villain that makes there confrontation more intersting. I also thought, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren & Willem Dafoe did a really good job with their roles as the more experienced actors on show. Another shoutout is the character of Black Manta who looks amazing on screen and was an interesting character, however, he wasn't in the film enough to leave me fully satisfied by his character. The story is interesting seeing this guy having to step up for a society he isn't really accepted in, plus I do find a sibling rivalry to be very interesting. But this films plot is very bloated, they try to fit so much story into this film that certain elements such as Black Manta get lost in the shuffle and end up not getting the attention that they needed. The script is great, the drama is well done and provides some pretty emotional moments, also the humour in the film came across well and felt pretty natural to me. The style of the film is a huge talking point in this film and i must say that mostly it looks amazing. Seeing these beautiful underwater fight scenes and cities is great and it felt like were beingintroduced to a new community. Though especially at the beginning of the film the CGI isn't completely up to par and takes you out of the film but it improves as the film progresses. Overall Aquaman is another hit for DC after Wonder Woman and is definitley worth a watch maybe even in 3D.",8,5,11,19 December 2018
Concussion," A great emotional true story
","I am a big sports fan so I was interested on seeing the other side of the story with concussion and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees a pathologist find out the damage that concussion in American football really can cause. Will smith plays Dr Bennett omalu in this film and this is possibly his best ever performance, he totally washed away the will Smith I usually see and bought into this character that is so interesting and likable. He nailed the accent and I feel like he gave everything in the dramatic scenes hoping for that Oscar. Albert brooks plays his boss and I thought he was pretty awesome in this film, his chemistry with smith is really good and he definitely provides a lot of comic relief which does really work. Alec Baldwin plays a doctor more in line with the football side and he is also great in this film, he has great scenes with smith that can be really emotional. Gugu mbatha raw plays a girl who ends up having to live with omalu and she does a good job as they start to build a friendship based on there differences and I liked it. The story of the film is really interesting as you see omalu going through the investigation into the concussion law and a conflict he does have with the NFL. However the first bit of the film just isn't that interesting as you see all these things that don't involve concussion and I was waiting for this film to get going. The script has some great dramatic dialogue especially by smith who nails it in the role, also surprisingly when needed it has some really good humour in it as well. The style of the film has some really intense scenes in it that makes you care about the situation. But I feel like it would been better if the subject matter was more balanced instead of being totally against the NFL which this film does. Overall I really enjoyed watching the film and found it interesting to watch.",8,2,4,27 March 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A return to form for the pirates franchise
","After the second film being a slight flop there was a lot of pressure on this film to succeed and I believe that for the majority it did. This film picks up where the last one leaves off with Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa and the rest of the crew going to Davey Jones Locker to save Jack Sparrow and unite all pirates against Cutler Beckett and Davey Jones oppression. Just like every Pirates film it is the Johnny Depp show as Jack Sparrow and he is great as always and his performance as Sparrow still hasn't got old yet for me and I always see these films expecting him to be great. The supporting crew is also great Elizabeth, Will, Cutler Beckett, Davey Jones and the supporting are all solid and good but my favourite has to be Barbossa he is just one of my favourite characters there is in films and his chemistry with Sparrow is excellent and he is a key part of this film. The story is good, however, there is some confusing unnecessary plot points which do take me out of it and I wish they had kept it a bit simpler. The script is also decent but not as good as the first pirates film as some of the dialogue is hard to understand and wooden. The style though is taken to the next level and especially towards the final battle especially the CGI is amazing and breath-taking which adds to the epicness of the film. This third film does a lot right and returns to the better days of pirates of the Caribbean.",8,0,1,3 July 2014
Deadpool 2," A good fun entertaining sequel
","The success of the first Deadpool film was a great thing for R-rated comic book films and now we have the sequel Deadpool 2 which is enjoyable even though it is not up to the levels of the first film in my opinion. The premise of the film sees Deadpool attempt to save a kid from a time travelling mutant who intends to save the future. Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as Wade Wilson/Deadpool, and he was born to play this role. He has incredible whit in this film and is an incredibly funny and charming hero for the audience to root for in this film, he also stretches to some very well done dramatic scenes in this film that was not present in the first film. Now the year of 2018 will be remembered as the year of Josh Brolin as he is crushing it at the moment, in this film he plays Cable and he was the perfect choice for the role. His gruff, tough attitude was perfect to work opposite Reynolds and he does a great job of adding depth and humanity to the character to make you root for his mission to a certain extent. I also really enjoyed watching Domino, she is a character who works with Deadpool and I really enjoyed seeing her powers in action, her personality also added a lot to this film and she was a shining light in this film. The returning characters are really good also even though some people may be disappointed as they're screen time is cut down to make way for some of the new players. The story surprisingly has a lot of depth to it, and sees Deadpool go on a pretty well done emotional journey throughout the film that I was surprised worked so well. However, the studio obviously increased the budget for this film as they try to cram so much into this film that didn't need to be there and it made this film feel more bloated then it needed to be. The script has obviously some really funny quips and references that had me laughing, also as mentioned some of the drama was handled pretty well. Though in this film, I felt that the contrast between the two wasn't handled as well as the first film and took me out of some of the most important moments in the film. The style of the film has some decent action scenes in it that took advantage of the things that they can do over other franchises. However, the final battle feels less then the previous film and overall it just feels like there is less action scenes in this film too. This led to a few pacing issues in this film and the film drags a little bit longer then it really needs to. Overall this is a fun comic book film but this won't be remembered as a truly revolutionary film like the first one will be, though fans of the first film should definitely watch this film.",7,1,4,17 May 2018
X-Men," The true saviour for comic book films that is great
","Before this film the realm of comic book films had been looked at but mostly laughed at, but that all changed with X-Men in 2000 that can be truly heralded as the saviour of comic book films. This film sees two outcast mutants - humans with special powers who are recruited to a school for their kind while a group of enemy mutants are attempting to start the war between Mutants and humanity. Now when we think of the character Wolverine we automatically think of Hugh Jackman and this all started with this film. He portrayed the character of Logan so well with the mixture of tough guy attitude, heart felt moments and quick witted humour providing a great lead for this first film and the many that would follow. The supporting cast do a good job as well with Patrick Stewart doing a phenomenal job as Professor Xavier by really coming across strongly as a good father figure but also powerful, likewise Ian Mckellen as Magneto was great and the delivery of his lines was so perfect that I couldn't imagine anybody else delivering them. Famike Janssen was also really good as Jean Grey, especially with the fact that I find her character quite boring in the comics so that is impressive. The one I am not a huge fan of though is that of James Marsden as Cyclops because they make him really boring and like a boyscout which is totally against his character in the comics. The story was good with Magneto's plot and some of the twists being well thought out, but I feel it would have been better if they had left a certain story arc out of the film that I hate. The script was okay with some of the dialogue being fun and witty or well delivered, but then their are other lines that are just bad and have no place in this film. The style of the film is great with the powers and action scenes really working and providing a solid platform for them to improve which they did. Overall this film is definitely worth a watch especially if you are an X-men fan like I am.",8,0,1,26 March 2014
Spider-Man 3," The death of the original Spider Man films
","I love the original Spider Man and Spider Man 2 but this film is possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The film starts with Peter Parker balancing his life as Peter and Spider Man relatively well until he comes under the attack by his old friend Harry Osborne as the New Goblin, a new villain called The Sandman and an Alien Symbiote which eventually creates the villain Venom. Tobey Maguire as the lead is a mixed bag for me he is a good spider man and peter parker in all three of the films however, I believe he is a negative in this film with his performance turning to be gut-wrenching and hard to watch because of how bad it is. Kirsten Dunst is once again total rubbish as Mary Jane which is expected in my opinion. James Franco is pretty good as Harry and is more relatable then Peter even though his climax is fairly predictable. JK Simmons is great as J Jonah Jameson but it is a small role so not really a big enough positive. Sandman and Venom are both mixed bags as I think Sandman is a decent character in this film but he is hurt by the overall film. Topher Grace is pretty good as Eddie Brock but as Venom not truly as he is not Venom enough to give the character justice. Now the story is horrific, the film is all over the place with too many story's such as Peter and MJ's relationship, the love triangle between Harry, Peter and MJ and the Ben Parker death story and this is without the villains getting enough screen time. The script is pretty shocking throughout and is a pretty big negative. The main positive is the style as everything looks cool and every character has there visually cool moment. However, I believe it is substance over style and this film fails magnificently at nearly everything.",2,0,1,26 June 2014
Thor: Ragnarok," A great fun third film
","After seeing the trailers for this film I was so hyped that this film may have been my most anticipated film of the year, and yes it falls short of those expectations but it is still a great fun marvel film. The film sees the goddess of death hela released on Asgard leaving Thor stranded and having to get a team together to stop her. Chris Hemsworth has always been great as Thor, but this is easily his best performance in the role. The film totally encapsulates his humour and charisma in a massive way that it makes him very likable and easy to root for. Tom hiddleston is back as Loki and he is great too, there chemistry is very good here and I've always liked how there brotherly relationship has developed. Mark ruffalo plays the hulk/banner in this film and this is easily the best hulk we have ever seen. Adding humanity to the hulk makes him easily the best part of this film, mixed with amazing effects that make him look incredible. Also banner is still as fun as he had always been, even though he plays second fiddle to the hulk in this film. Tessa Thompson plays Valkyrie and she was so much fun to watch, she is a rebellious drunk who is full of charisma and likability. Cate blanchett plays hela in the film and even though she is clearly having fun with the role and is pretty menacing, she didn't really stand out that much to me. Special mentions for Jeff goldblum as the grandmaster and taika waititi as korg who were absolutely hysterical and had me laughing throughout the film. The story is definitely a mixed bag in this one, I really enjoyed how the story develops in sakaar the gladiator pit as it shows Thor in a different light and he recruits his team. But the overall plot is pretty weak, which isn't helped by its focus on fun action and forgetting about a serious plot really. Which gets me to the script, this is possibly marvels funniest movie as it had me laughing pretty much the whole way through. But, this definitely comes at the cost of any real drama that those other films had, there wasn't that moment that made me emotionally care about the situation. The style of the film is a big plus, the more vibrant colours and massive scale actions scenes work for the most part and it really embraces its more sci-fi roots. Overall I had a lot of fun with Thor Ragnarok, and I do believe it is the best Thor film which is definitely worth a watch.",8,67,123,25 October 2017
The Terminator," A fantastic action film that was ahead of its time
","When talking about the great sci fi action films the terminator is always near the top for me and was massively ahead of its time. The story sees that in the future the machines have taken over until they are defeated by a leader called John Connor. In a last ditch attempt they send a terminator back to the 1980s to kill his mother Sarah. In response Connor sends one of his best soldiers back to protect his mother. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger has become famous for his portrayal as the terminator and this is one of the best villain roles ever. He totally encapsulated what this cyborg needed to be and it is one of the best ever villain performances. Linda Hamilton is best known for her portrayal as Sarah Connor and she is really good in her role and because of her averagness you really care about her character and hope nothing bad happens to her. Lt traxler was a pretty good character too even though he isn't in the film that much. Maybe the only negative I have about this film is the character of Kyle Reese, i'm not sure if it's the performance or if he is really just good for exposition. The character was important and I just wasn't a big fan of the character. The story is simple but effective and it just works. Also James Cameron created a sci fi universe in this film and it is one that fits the dystopian idea perfectly. The script is great with the dialogue between the characters feeling natural and made the characters, also this film has some of the most iconic lines in film history in it. The style is fantastic with all the action scenes being exciting and high octane, also the design of the terminator was way ahead of its time and it was great in this film. Also the future scenes were great in the way they should be. Overall this is a fantastic film that you should definitely see.",9,4,5,12 March 2014
Ready Player One," A great film filled with pop culture references
","This film has been on the top of my list to see and I have now had the chance to see Ready Player One and I think this is a great film with a lot of fun laced into it. The premise of the film sees a dystopia future where most people spend their time in a virtual world called the Oasis. It's up to a group of people to find an Easter egg and save this world from total destruction. Tye Sheridan is am up and coming actor gaining larger roles and he does a really good job in this film, whether it be his character in the real world or in the oasis. He displayed great innocence and it allowed the audience to connect with his character as he truly embraced who he is in this world like people do every day playing video games. All the other characters in the oasis are really fun characters and I really liked their interactions and they came across as a likeable team. Ben mehndolson plays the villain in this film and even though his character isn't that unique he delivers a fun great villainous performance. He is just so natural as a villain and you can tell he is having fun in his role in this film. Mark rylance and Simon pegg have smaller roles in this film but they do good jobs with what their characters are given. The story when it comes to the Oasis is really interesting, seeing these different worlds and universes in a virtual reality works really well mixed with the unique visuals. However, I feel like the story in the real world wasn't particularly strong, it was just very bland and by the numbers. It affects this film as especially in the third act it focuses too much on this aspect of the story. The script has some surprisingly good humour in it that allows the characters to feel more real and easily connectable. The drama has decent moments in it, though I do really feel that it can get pretty preachy, especially as the film reaches its climax which affected the fun aspects of the film. The style is absolutely brilliant, the CGI is all really good and feels appropriate for this world. The pop culture references are fantastic and really bought a smile to my face mixed with some pretty decent action scenes. Overall this is a really fun fun to watch with the extra bit of quality added by Steven Spielberg to make it a great film.",8,0,1,3 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," A fantastic addition to tarantinos collection
","So this is the first film I have seen released in 2016 and we are off to a fantastic start. The premise of this film sees a bounty hunter and his captive arrive at a lodge in a blizzard, surrounded by nefarious characters it becomes a mystery to find out a deadly secret. Samuel l jackson Is amazing in this film, he even channels his performance from pulp fiction at times. He is the funniest character in this film and the coolest character in this film. Kurt Russell is also really good in this film, he has good chemistry with jackson and was a great character. Jennifer jason leigh also does a surprisingly good job considering her character doesn't give her that much to work with. Walton goggins is awesome in this film and probably my joint favourite character with jackson. Tim roth and channing tatum ate also great in their roles. The story has a mystery detective feel about it and I enjoyed it because it left you on the edge of your seat as you learned things with the characters and it managed to sustain it to me. The script is obviously fantastic with the brilliant dialogue flowing and making even the most mundane scenes seem interesting. The style was good with the western setting working for the film and the soundtrack being absolutely amazing. However, we then cone down to the one Achilles heel for this film and that is it's pacing. I do not believe this film needed to be 3 hours long and I feel like some situations were drawn out too long. Overall though this is a fantastic film and if your a fan of Tarantino is a must see.",9,5,14,8 January 2016
Ocean's Twelve," A big comedown from Oceans 11
","Now Oceans 11 was a huge surprise to me and I absolutely love it meaning I was so looking forward to this but I was so disappointed with the sequel. This film is three years after the original with Tony Benedict being angry about his financial loss forcing Danny and his gang to perform another heist to get his money back. With the rest of the crew they plan a way to outsmart a shadowy thief in a battle of wits. Now this has an even larger cast with the majority being good with Don Cheadle, Brad Pitt and Vincent Cassel shining but with a few disappointments from the original cast. To be honest the story of Oceans 11 wasn't superb but this story sucks, it has no substance and has plot points that ruin the film for me and make me not really interested in the third one. The script is alright but once again it is nowhere near the level of the first and even though there is some funny dialogue I was slightly disappointed. Also being away from Vegas wasn't as good as this film and took some of the style away from the film, but the style is still pretty good cause of the lavish locations. This film is a lot weaker then the first film and is plainly average in every way.",5,0,1,29 August 2014
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A fantastic more comic accurate spider man film
","With spider-man finally back in the marvel cinematic universe this film was one i was hugely anticipating and I believe that this film completely delivered for a more comic accurate spider-man that we have been missing. The premise of this film is set a few months after captain America civil war peter Parker has gone back to being his neighbourhood spider man. Feeling underutilized and trying to deal with school problems he tries to take down a powerful foe. After his brief but memorable performance in civil war, tom Holland is back as peter Parker and I think he is pretty perfect in this role. He is the young man with a lot of energy trying to find his way in life and it totally fits the role especially when his peter Parker. When he is spider man he nails the humour and likability that is required for the role, he was so much fun to watch on the screen in a role that is perfect for him. The supporting cast is full of heavy hitters Michal Keaton plays Adrian toomes/the vulture in this film and I think he was great in this role. He had a lot of intensity for the role bit also adds a lot of humanity and emotion to his character that makes him kind of understandable and easily one of the better marvel villains. I like many people were worried about Robert Downey jnr's presence in this film as tony stark but he was used brilliantly in this film. He isn't in many scenes but when he is he adds a lot of depth to his growing mentorship and friendship with peter without taking anything away from spider man. Jon favreau reprises his role of happy hogan and he is really funny in this film, but he also has a fun relationship with Peter as he tries to look after him. Marissa tomei plays a younger aunt may and I really enjoyed watching her and Peter's relationship throughout this film, they worked really well together and this is my favourite iteration of this duo. The story of this film is good, I really enjoyed watching peter deal with school as we really haven't seen it in as large a way as it does in this film. It also felt right for peter to feel underutilized as spider man and I really felt for him as a character. However, I do think this film maybe tries to try and cram a bit too much into this film. There is so much going on that such things as the romance and the decathlon he has to partake in falls flat and came across as things I didn't really need in this film. The script for this film is really good, the humour pretty much works across the board with multiple characters having really funny dialogue. The drama in the film also is really good especially towards the end of the film where is is ramped up for a great finale. The style of the film has great fun action scenes in it with some being really unique for this film compared to other spider man films. The film has a pretty lighthearted tone to it but it has action that is pretty visceral towards the end of the film and it was great to watch. Overall this is a spider man film for a new generation and I did love this film which needs to be watch especially if you are a spider man fan.",9,39,73,7 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The ending to my favourite set of films ever
","Just like the previous two Star Wars films The Return of the Jedi is one of the greatest film of all time, however, this is the weakest of the original star wars film in my opinion. This film starts just after The Empire Strikes Back with Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2D2 and Lando on Tattoine attempting to save Han Solo from Jabba The Hutt. This film has the fantastic performances from everybody from the previous films and looks at all the awesome themes that the previous films did as well. Now as I said before this film had a few problems well one problem in my opinion THE EWOKS, these cuddly bears were the first shot in the start of the stupefying that would follow in the prequels and it is just unbelievable that these little bears would ever be able to fight the storm troopers. But this film is awesome because of the performances and also out of the six films I believe that the encounter between Luke, Vader and The Emperor is the greatest lightsaber duel out of everything because of the themes, the conflict the simple good vs. evil it all represents and this scene alone truly makes this film awesome and belong with the rest of the original Star Wars films.",10,0,2,16 April 2014
Fast & Furious 6," A good crazy action film
","Following watching Fast 5, I have now just seen Fast 6 and I enjoyed this one about the same amount as Fast 5 & Fast 7 meaning these are a solid set of films. The premise of the film sees agent Hobbs recruit Dominic Torretto and his crew in order to take down a rival gang, who has a former family member amongst there ranks. Vin Diesel is back as Torretto and he does a better job in this film, his character has a more emotional stake in the story this time and even though he isn't the best actor I thought he did a good job with the material given. Dwayne Johnson really does add something to these films, I liked his chemistry with the crew and thought pretty much everybody bounced off of each other well. Luke Evans plays the villain in this film and I thought he did a good job, it was nice to see a villain that squared up to the heroes and provided a challenge both physically and mentally. However, I feel like in these films that Paul Walker is just really bland and really doesn't add to much to the film, I know the tragic circumstances around his life but that doesn't change my opinion that he is a pretty boring character in this film. The story in the film has a more dramatic feel to it the the last film, it feels like there are personal stakes in this film and that makes it more interesting. However, the film never does a particularly good job to get across the villains motivations, it just feels like we gotta stop him because he is the bad guy in the film but there isn't a particularly interesting reason for these two crews to be feuding. The script is fun with a well balanced use of humour and drama which helped improve this film. The style is as ludicrous as you would expect, there are some entertaining and high octane action scenes that are fun to watch. Though I felt the setting for the climax of the film was really dark and it was quite hard to see exactly what was really going on, what you can see is entertaining but you can't see enough. Overall this is an enjoyable film that is another fun addittion to this franchise.",7,1,1,4 August 2019
The Expendables," a fun action packed film with some of the most iconic faces in film
","Going into watching this film you just simply must know what you were getting into an action film with one liners. This film has almost everybody in it but the main two are director Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham as the main members of the all star group The expendables who set out to take out a dictator and liberate a nation. The performances are what you would expect and great for this film every single one of them, also some awesome cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who I hope to see both in the sequel more. The action is fantastic throughout but the last action scene oh my goodness is some of the best action there is ever and is clearly the best part of the film as expected. Dolph ludgren as the crazed ex member of the team was a cool dynamic also stone cold Steve Austin is great in action and Eric Roberts is an awesome villain like he always is. However, for a mindless action film there is some slow parts which I could have done without. Also I would have liked the characters of jet li, randy cetoure and terry crews to be expanded more instead. But this is an awesome film filled with everything you would expect.",7,0,0,20 May 2014
Blade II," Its okay but not as good as the original Blade
",I believe the original Blade is a highly underrated comic book film that is great but this film is okay and fails to live up to the level of the original. This film sees Blade ally with a group of Vampires to go against a new vampire hunting race that could affect vampires and humans alike. Wesley Snipes is fantastic as Blade and I really believe that he was the perfect casting for the mix of charisma and sturdiness for the character. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag I don't understand why Whistler was in this film but I thought he was good in the film. I thought the person who was looking like he was having the most fun was Ron Perlman who was great in his villainous role with his chemistry with Blade being really good. Blade's love interest is poor and a waste of time for the story and the main villain is not memorable at all. The story is poor compared to the first one with the romance being lazy and most of the team are not developed at all and the unnecessary bringing back of Whistler. The script is okay with Snipes and Perlman having the best lines and delivering well but nobody else had any decent lines at all. The style was great with the Gothic take of vampire lifestyle mixing with real life that makes this character so unique. Blade 2 is okay but it isn't as good as the original and I won't be rushing to see it again.,6,8,15,11 September 2014
Alien," A great old school sci fi horror
","In preparation for alien covenant later this month I am aiming to watch the alien films and review them, starting with alien which is a great horror film. The premise of the film sees a group of human travellers come across an alien planet and an alien life that threatens there very existence. Sigourney weaver plays Ripley in this film and she does a great job, her character goes through a great amount of progression throughout and you really care about her character due to her strong performance. Ian Holm is really young in this film and really good in the film, his performance is really interesting to watch especially as you see the direction his character takes. The rest of the crew are really good too including john hurt, this is a horror film where you don't want to see the team die which helps the strength of the film. The alien itself is the perfect villain for this film, it stalks the crew in interesting ways and you are interested in seeing it hunt this crew down. The story is incredibly simple but it really works for this film, seeing the crew trying to survive this alien can be enthralling at times. Also some of the twists make this a more compelling film and helps make this a more unique watch. The script has some slightly interesting dialogue especially some good banter between the team towards the beginning off the film. But there isn't really anything special about the script or iconic lines like aliens has. The style of the film has some great tension building in it as you are in terror watching it. However, the pacing in this film is a bit poor, the first act is a bit of a drag and moves really slowly and I feel it does really take a while to get going. Overall this is a great film and if you are a fan of survival horror films then this is a must see, I am not but I still really enjoy this film so give it a chance.",8,1,2,1 May 2017
The Polar Express," an average Christmas film that falls a little flat
","It seems in my house every year at Christmas we watch the polar express and I don't really know why as it is a completely average film that has never done allot for me being honest. This film sees a a non believing boy get on a magic train to go to the north pole and meet Santa Claus. Now a big problem for this film is the lead 'hero boy', the character is just not very interesting at all and you really will not care about him as he screws up throughout the film. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, Tom hanks voices the train conductor and does an awesome job in this role and you feel like he is easily the coolest character in the film. Also the other boy billy's journey is really interesting and you see the character grow over the film and in the end he becomes the character you are rooting for. The girl is a pretty bland character herself and the annoying kid is just way over the top and has absolutely no redeemable qualities to him at all. Overall the story is okay with Billy journey being interesting and the discussion about belief or non belief being solid. But when the audience doesn't care about the main characters story then the story definitely misfired. The script is okay mainly because of the train conductors dialogue but everyone else's kind of falls flat. The style of the film though is fantastic the cgi really works to give this film a darker tone and it is sometimes breath taking seeing the beautiful visuals that this film has. Overall though this is just an average film that you can definitely skip on.",5,3,7,27 December 2014
The Town," another fantastic ben affleck directed film.
","Before he started directing Ben Affleck was seen as a bit of a joke, but no longer as he is now a great actor and a fantastic director. The town is just another example of his fantastic vision for directing. This story sees Affleck and his crew rob a bank but with a witness so Affleck has to make sure she doesn't snitch on the crew. After a lot of meetings the crew have to do one last job that will define Affleck's future. First in the leading role I thought Affleck was great and his performance was a real step up from his acting before his film. The supporting cast is also really good with Jeremy Renner as the crazy member of the gang and he worked well with Affleck. Rebecca hall was really good as Affleck's love interest and she does a very good job in what could have been a throwaway role. Jon Hamm is the policeman going after the crew and he does a convincing job in his role against the crew. Also Blake lively does a good job in her smaller role and was good for what she needed to be. The story is okay as it focuses on afflecks life with lesser stories involved that are good. However, I found that the reasons for the robberies not being compelling and took a bit away from the film. The script is excellent with the dynamics and dialogue between all the characters is top class and among the best. Affleck has a unique style and I believe it really worked for this film. This is a fantastic film and just proves how much of a talent Affleck is.",9,0,0,17 September 2014
Suicide Squad," A great fun comic book film
","This film has been getting mixed reviews to say the least and I have now seen suicide squad and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees a group of super villains assembled by the U.S. government to take down a supernatural entity. When will smith was cast as deadshot not everybody was happy but I can tell you that he is fantastic in this film. He managed to bring the extra layer of complexity needed for the character but also the charisma and humour that you would expect from will smith. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was born to play the role, she fits it so well. She is clearly crazy but also so charming and charismatic that you want to see more of her. She is beautiful and funny and alongside deadshot is probably the best thing in this film. Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller in this film and she is great, she truly nails the harshness of the character and how morally grey she is. Joel kinnamin plays rick flagg and I actually thought he did a good job with his character definitely developing throughout the film. The real surprises of the film were the characters of el diablo and captain boomerang played by jai Courtney. First of all el diablo is one of the most interesting characters in the film and I liked his powers. I am not a huge fan of Courtney as an actor but I thought he was the perfect choice for boomerang in this film, he brought the snarky fun that his kind of ridiculous character merits and I thought he was great. And finally to Jared leto as the joker, I thought he was great in the film and delivered a different but fun performance. Its just he wasn't in the film anywhere near enough and he felt incredibly underutilised. The story has some decent character depth involved as these villains try to atone for some of their sins. However, the plot is just paper thin and incredibly bland with there not being much uniqueness to the storytelling here. The script has some really great humour easily the best of the dc extended universe films. But it also knows how to use dramatic moments to make you care about the majority of the characters. The style of the film has some good action scenes especially with the unique weapons used by the squad. However, the film has clear paving issues by finding it hard to introduce everybody and keep the film cool. The awful cgi really cheapons the villain plot as well. Overall I really enjoyed suicide squad and it is definitely worth a watch.",6,9,14,6 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," An epic action film
","With age of ultron coming up I have rewatched captain America the winter soldier and I enjoyed it more the second time and realised just how epic this film truly is. The premise of this film sees captain America team up with black widow, Nick fury and the falcon to take down the mysterious winter soldier while trying to take down a conspiracy. Chris Evans was a bit of a controversial choice as captain America because of his connections with the fantastic 4 franchise but he was the perfect choice for captain America. He totally encapsulates what Steve Rodgers is all about and the moral character but action packed hero that he is in the comics. The supporting cast is also top notch in this film with Scarlett Johansson returning as black widow and her character is given much more relevance and back story so we care about her character, it also helps that her chemistry with Evans is fantastic. Samuel l Jackson is back as Nick fury and this is his best role yet, his character is given allot of depth in this film and it makes fury a really interesting character. Anthony Mackie plays Sam Wilson the falcon and he is a really cool character in the film and you feel his connection with captain America as they have gone through a similar past that makes you care about his character and their friendship. Robert Redford plays a high ranking shield officer in the film and he is great in his performance and really brings a real star power to the film whenever he is on screen. The character of the winter soldier was a great action star in this film, however, he isn't in the film that much and you want to know more about him that you won't get the chance too. The story could have been simple but it wasn't it had real moral conflicts and emotional moments that really made the story a highlight of the film. The script was fantastic with allot of great humour and some drama that really made these characters interesting and relatable. The style was superb, this is one of the best spy/action films ever with the action scene being perfect and the action being completely appropriate. Overall this is a truly epic film and one that you should definitely see.",10,2,4,8 April 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," a forgetful film that proves there is nothing like the original
","Boy did they milk the oceans franchise. After a fantastic first film and a average second film it was up for debate what this film would be like and it is just simply forgetful. This sees Danny, rusty and they crew going on a revenge heist against Willy bank after Reuben is betrayed by bank. Now I think George Clooney and brad Pitt did a great job in both of the other films but in this one it feels like they're being lazy and phoning it in which is hugely disappointing considering how good they have been. A weakness of this film is also just how large the cast is and how it focuses on nobody like the past two films did. I also feel it really missed a main female character as the previous ones did a good job and really helped the film. I did like matt Damon in this film and I also did like Andy Garcia returning and al pacino as the new villain was fun. The story was awful as half the time I had no idea what was going on and once again with it focusing on everyone it focused on nobody which was a big reason for a disappointing story. The script was alright and there was some funny dialogue but not enough to help the film enough. I think returning to Vegas was another great idea and the style of this film is great it is a shame the substance is not so good. This should be the end for this franchise for a while and let's just remember just how good oceans 11 was.",4,0,0,12 September 2014
Doctor Strange," Another fantastic marvel film that is truly unique
","I am a huge fan of the marvel cinematic universe and I think it is just getting better and better and this trend continues with doctor strange. The premise of the film sees a rich surgeon suffer horrific injuries, on his route for help he encounters a group that can help him and give him the opportunity to become doctor strange. Benedict cumberbatch plays Stephen strange and he is truly excellent in the role. He was funny when he needed to be but also had allot of depth to his character. You see true progression in his mentality and it makes him such a fun interesting character. Chiwetel ejiofor plays mordo in this film and he is probably the most interesting character in this film, his relationship with strange is fascinating to watch as you see both of their point of views with the situation. Tilda swintons casting as the ancient one received allot of criticism but she was great in this as a teacher for strange that had many layers to her character that made her a very interesting character. Rachel McAdams an Benedict wong at both great in this film for their roles but I do slightly wish they were in the film a little more. Madds mikkelson is a great actor and he does the best he can as the villain in this film with a few memorable moments he just doesn't have much to him at all which does hurt some of the conflict in the film. The story is a real good origin story for strange that seems him develop as a character really well, it also does a really good job for the majority of the supporting characters as well. However, I wasn't a huge fan with the last act of the film because I feel like it wraps up a bit too easy. The script has some really good humour in it but also mixes good drama that makes you really care about the characters. The style is so unique it is unreal, there are parts of the film that are completely trippy but they give this film such a unique feel. Also the magic battles were really cool and different in this film. Overall this is one of the better marvel origin films and is definitely worth a watch.",9,2,5,28 October 2016
Interstellar," A great sci fi epic
","In preparation for seeing the Martian this week I thought I would watch interstellar and I thought it was a great movie. The premise of the movie sees earth dying, so a team of astronaughts go to a solar system to look for a new planet for mankind. Matthew mcconaughey has had a career resurgence recently and he is great in this film. You really feel for his character and sympathise for him as he is separated from his daughter. You root for him throughout the film. The kid actress who plays young Murphy was really good and you felt for her character and her relationship with mcconaughey really carried the film. Anne Hathaway was really good in this film and she brings great emotion to her character and is a great addition. Michael Caine is good, Jessica chastain is good and matt Damon is great as well. The story of coop and murrs relationship is easily the best part of this film and it brings allot of good emotion. However, there isn't too much to the weight to the overall space exploration story. Also towards the end it becomes pretty convoluted and confusing. The script is really good with great drama and a surprisingly good amount of humour in this film. The style of the cinematography is phenomenal as you truly feel like your in space with the crew and it does a brilliant job. However, there is a real pacing issue with this film which in the end makes it a little boring at times. This is a great space adventure that you should see.",8,0,2,30 September 2015
Full Metal Jacket," a great war film that encapsulates the time period
","I am a big fan of a clockwork Orange so I was looking forward to this film and I must say it is great. This film sees a soldier becoming dehumanized by war and sees others in the same situation. Now Mathew modine plays the soldier joker and he is the one who we are meant to root for. Now he does a good job as the soldier that everybody else is but he doesn't do anything to make him really stand out. There is one scene towards the end of the film that helps but it isn't really enough to make his character that interesting. The supporting cast also does a good job as soldiers in the Vietnam war and Adam Baldwin is good in the role as the crazy soldier. But there was a fantastic performance in the role and that is the drill sergeant, this guy was super scary and intimidating and everything he says is gold and he is the best performance in the role. The story is a mixed bag as it is kind of split into half, I loved the first half in the army training camp and I kind of wish the whole film could have been in the boot camp. The Vietnam part of the film had enjoyable action but really lacked something and had allot of downtime. Also the end was a bit disappointing that could have been improved. The script is great in the film with all the army dialogue working and feeling natural for the film. Also even though most of the drill sergeants dialogue is not scripted it is great and deserves credit. The style was great and Kubricks cinematography made this film feel like a great war epic and makes you feel like you are in with the marines on their mission. Overall this film is great and I definitely think you should see it.",8,0,1,17 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A fantastic final chapter to this new trilogy
","I have seen online this film has been gaining mixed reviews across the board by fans and critics alike but I have seen this film twice now and I have to admit as a huge star wars can this was a fantastic experience to watch in the cinema and a worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise. The premise of the film sees Rey, Finn & Poe on the hunt to track down an ancient evil to save the galaxy while kylo ren does his best to find them and achieve his grand plan. Daisy Ridley was really made by the force awakens and her character of Rey has really evolved from that time, she has a really interesting story here which is continued from the previous two films and Ridley does an excellent job in making you care about her character and the situation she is in. John boyega as Finn and Oscar Isaac as Poe are given more to do in this film then they did in the Last Jedi and they do really good jobs in this film, their chemistry together is fantastic and you really are both of them step up into big roles in the film and it really works. Adam driver has been fantastic as kylo ren in these films and he possibly has the best story in this film, there are huge layers to his performamce and his dynamic with Rey is really interesting in the film and really drives it. Also a special shoutout due to the circumstances they do a really good job with the late Carrie Fishers role as Leia as she plays a really important role in this film. The story of the film is very fast moving and exciting, they answer the majority of questions that needed to be answered in a fulfilling way. However, my biggest criticism of this movie is that it does play it a bit safe with is story telling and sometimes the stakes don't feel as large as they should do for a final film in a trilogy. The script is great, there is an appropriate use of humour and some really good drama that makes the characters feel more interesting and human. The style of the film is enthralling, the combat is exciting and the action scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat and as mentioned before the pacing is fast and will keep you engaged. Overall this is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars legacy and an experience you need to have on the big screen.",9,8,21,21 December 2019
Pacific Rim," the best monster/mech mash up there is
","Now this film will not be for everybody those who are looking for an Oscar film don't bother but those who are looking for an exciting action packed deep film watch pacific rim. The film starts with earth being destroyed by monsters from a rift in the ocean so to combat the earth created mechs to stand up. The acting is solid throughout with the pairing in the Jaeger (mech) both delivering good performances but in acting idriss Elba once again stole the show, there is a speech he delivers in this film and oh my goodness it felt like I would happily fight for him. This is emphatic with the point that this is different to a film like transformers where the human parts of the film are boring whereas in pacific rim the human parts are fantastic. But pacific rim's biggest strength by far is the action between monster and mech this may be the greatest action on a large scale ever with all the action feeling heavy and realistic for what a situation would really be like. There's a couple of scientist characters that I didn't really like in this film and also you could argue they could have split the action and talking up a little more but these are my only minor gripes as I absolutely love this film and it is now the standard bearer for these types of films.",9,1,2,12 May 2014
American Sniper," a great film that highlights an incredible life
","I have seen many different perspectives on this film but for me I think it is great and I think that people should see it. This film documents the life of Chris Kyle who is the deadliest sniper in the US military of all time racking up a body count of almost 200 kills. Now Bradley Cooper is fantastic in this film and has really brought Chris Kyle to life and make the character a person we can believe in. He deserves his Oscar nomination and I think he does a great job in the tough guy role. Siena Miller plays his wife and she also does a great job really being the emotional centre of the film and making you really care about her families situation. They introduce a rival sniper and give him a little backstory and his character is cool even though he isn't that important. I do wish that more of the side characters had done more and made me care about them more. The story of his life is incredible and you see him on his tours and you really see the emotional pain that war has given to this man that is a true casualty of war in his mind. However, I do think this film Treats Kyle as a white knight and a war hero even though what he did becomes a bit more grey and you could argue he did some bad things, I just wish we had seen more of the complexity. The script is great and Clint Eastwood did a great job mixing the drama really well with the occasional humour to make these characters feel human and relatable. The style is beautiful and I love how it made war look dark and gritty instead of making it look lovely and over dramatized. Overall this is a great film that should be seen.",8,13,26,28 January 2015
Rocky II," A fantastic sequel that is underrated
","In my continuation of watching the rocky movies comes the highly underrated rocky 2. The premise of this film sees rocky retire after the events of the first movie. He gets married to Adrian and has to deal with normal life until creed offers him the rematch of a lifetime. Now Stallone not only starred in this film but wrote and directed it. He is fantastic in this film, he is just such a likable character that you want to do well. Rocky is funny but also in pain in this movie and you see the anguish in his character at not being able to help. Everyone returns for the sequel and the standout was Carl weathers as Apollo creed. In the first film he didn't really have a character but in this film its personal for him as you see him embark on a mission of revenge. Adrian's character was further enhanced in this film and I love their relationship. Rocky's coach was again great in this film and really adds allot. The story is great in this film you see how rocky has to deal with real life situations. Then obviously all the boxing stuff felt more personal in this film and it really works. The script is okay with some decent humour I just sometimes feel like the clash of humour and drama didn't always work. The style is great with the grim reality of Rocky's world contrasting with the real world he wants in boxing. The training montage is great and the last boxing match really works. Overall this is a fantastic sequel that really worked for me.",9,0,1,24 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A slight improvement but another poor film
","Now after The Phantom Menace I did not have too much hope for this film but I must admit that this film is still bad but it is slightly better then the Phantom Menace. This film is ten years after the original prequel with Obi Wan being Anakin Skywalker's master, they are sent in to protect Padme Amidala from an assassin while trying to uncover a sinister plot. Now the positives first (the small amount) my favourite character in the prequels is Jango Fett and he is a great character and his fight on Kamino with Obi-Wan is very different for a Star Wars film and is a great action sequence. The battle of Geonosis is the first time a bunch of Jedi are fighting which is exhilarating but the main positive in this film and the best part of all the prequels is the first time we see Yoda fight, this is an awesome Star Wars moment. Now the negatives everything else but the main one is the relationship between Anakin and Padme this has some of the worst dialogue ever created and the most boring scenes in film. Some of the CGI of the film is poor and doesn't hold up to the Phantom Menace even. Also even though it is cool to see Christopher Lee in Star Wars he is barely in the film which could be seen as a mistake. Another big mistake is Anakin's character I understand he is meant to be different because of his turning to Vader but he just isn't relatable and is whiny. Now neither this film or the Phantom Menace are worth being near the licence of Star Wars and I hope future films are not like this film.",4,0,4,6 May 2014
Lion," A good emotional true life story
","This film has been nominated for best picture at the 2017 Oscars so I thought I would give it a watch and I did enjoy this film. The premise of this film sees a young boy's journey after he goes missing in India and ends up in Australia 25 years later. Dev Patel plays the older version of the kid in this film and he is really good in this film, he gives a very emotional performance that makes you really buy his characters situation and makes you care about it. Nicole Kidman and David Wenham play his adopted Australian parents in this film and they both give good performances. Kidman especially gives a strong performance and her chemistry with Patel is really good and you buy her characters development throughout the film. Rooney Mara plays his love interest in the film and i thought she did a good job in the film adding a bit of life to patel's life and i thought at first their relationship worked. Also the kid actors did a pretty decent job in the film for what they are needed to do. The story of this film has some great emotional tones to it as you see this person's story as he tries to be accepted with his life despite his past. However, I did find the first 40 minutes focusing on his childhood to be pretty boring and slow paced and I feel like they could have been used more effectively as flashbacks for Patel's character as the film progresses. The script also has some really good dramatic dialogue that helps make some of the situations more intense and heartfelt then they would have been. However, the film tries to use comedy at some points, especially at the start of Mara and patel's romance and it didn't work at all and hurt the film a little bit. The style of the film has some excellent emotion and if you don't get close to tears at a point in this film I do question your emotions. But as mentioned before I feel like the first half of the film was poorly paced and could have been done better in my opinion. Overall this is a good film with allot of emotion involved in it that may be worth a watch if you like true stories with emotion in it.",7,1,1,7 February 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Affleck hits 3 for 3 as this is a fantastic film
","During his acting career Ben Affleck has received allot of criticism but I don't care what anybody says when it comes to the films he has directed he has knocked every single one of them out of the park. This film sees a 4 year old girl abducted, so her aunt gets 2 private investigators to find her. Now Casey Affleck is great in this role, he really gives the drama across incredibly well and even gets you to question the events of the film. The supporting cast is also really good in this film. Michelle Monaghan does a great job as Affleck's partner and their chemistry is really good in this film providing the backbone of the films strengths. Morgan Freeman does a superb job in this film and really provides a character in shades of grey and performs it perfectly. Ed Harris is really good in this film and just like freeman plays up the shades of grey in this film very well, and everybody else in this film does a good job. The story is fantastic in this film as you feel how heavy this situation hits the people involved and as plot twists go all of them really work. The ending is also a great look at social commentary on what is right and wrong. The script is also top notch with the dialogue between everybody really good and convincing in this realistic film. The style is alright but it does feel like a lot of these films have very similar styles to them and this film is similar but the formula does work. This is a fantastic film that is a heavy watch but definitely worth seeing.",9,2,5,21 October 2014
The Lost City of Z," An above average true story
","After being made to watch the trailer for this film a few times before other films I actually had some interest in the lost city of z and this film is alright but I don't really care if I ever watch it again. The premise of the film sees an explorer go on an adventure to find a lost city in the amazon. Charlie Hunnam plays the explorer in this film and he does a great job in this film, at first I thought he was a little stoic but he really grows as the film progresses. He brings a lot of passion an humanity to his character and you do care about him and his family situation. Robert pattinson from the twilight franchise is in this film and he was really good as well, I really liked the friendship that builds between him and hunnam and bought it. Sienna miller plays hunnam's wife in this film and I thought she was a strong character and her chemistry with hunnam was really good. Tom Holland who is the new spider man is in this film and he does a really good job especially when you consider that he is still a young man. Also it is great to see ian McDiarmid who Is the emperor in the star wars franchise in a film again. The story is easily the weakest part of this film, it follows this guy and really his obsession with finding this city without really good motivation. You never fully care about him finding the city and this film goes through a lot of side plots that just aren't focused or interesting enough for you to care. The script of the film has some great dramatic monologues and dialogue that does help make you care about the performance's. However, this film is a complete humourless affair and it does hurt the film as there isn't really a moment to relax. The style of the film has some decent action scenes in it and some great cinematography. But it has severe pacing issues, as mentioned before the film attempts to much and it makes this film a rather boring affair. Overall this is an okay film but probably isn't worth watching if you are not interested in the subject matter.",6,28,57,29 March 2017
Southpaw," A good dramatic boxing film
","I do enjoy a good sport film, especially a boxing film so I was excited to see this film. The premise of the film sees a top boxer's life get turned upside down as he attempts to get his life and career back on track. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the best actors going today and he continues that in this film with a great performance. You truly care about his character and the situation he has been put in, he also has transformed himself physically which adds to his character. Rachel mcadams plays his wife in the film and she does a good job adding humanity to his character unfortunately she just isn't in the film that much. Forest Whittaker plays his coach and he is great in this film adding a personal friendship into Gyllenhaals life. 50 cent is the boxing promoter in this film and he does a good job in the role. The girl who plays Gyllenhaals daughter in the film does a really good job being a believable kid actress that delivers a powerful emotional performance. The story has some really good dramatic qualities and a great ending. But at times it does feel like this film tries to beat you over the head with the drama which could have been done with being shortened a little bit. The script has some great dramatic dialogue that really made the drama hit home. However, for a sports film there is absolutely no humour in it which I understand because of the dark tone but I do feel like it could have done with a bit of humour. The style of the film is a mixed bag, all the boxing scenes are awesome with the hits feeling hard and heavy. However, the overall tone of the film is incredibly dark and it is a bit of a hard watch. Overall this is a good film but it isn't as good as creed or rocky but it is a decent film.",7,0,0,10 May 2016
Ant-Man," A great addition to the marvel universe
","I have finally seen ant man and I can confirm that this film succeeds in its execution and ant man is a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe. The film Sees burglar Scott Lang forced to help his mentor hank Pym and become the ant man to do a heist to save the world. Now Paul Rudd plays Scott and he does a great job in the role because he isn't really an actor you could imagine as a superhero and they play that up. He is funny and relatable to the audience in the role and I though he got all the dramatic scenes he needed to do right as well and is one of my favourite heroes in this universe. clearly the best actor in this film is Michael Douglas as hank Pym and he is fantastic in this movie he nailed this character. He was funny when he needed to be he was dramatic when he needed to be and his chemistry with the other main characters was great too. Evangeline Lilly is an actress who has got her career back on track and she was great as hope. She was tough, but fun and likable which made her a good character in this film. Michael Pena is really good in the film with his humour being a good addition to the film. Corey stoll did a decent job as the villain it's just that he wasn't given much to do in this film and his character wasn't given allot of depth at all. The idea of the heist was a good story of the redemption of Scott Lang and I really liked how this story was a more personal story with Scott. I also liked the back stories of hank Pym and hope. But I think that they didn't give enough depth to certain aspects of the film like the villain and Scotts relationship with his daughter and it didn't hit the emotional punch that it was meant to. The script was mixed with some good humour and drama but sometimes it felt like that it didn't hit sometimes and that was due to different elements but it is a weakness of the film. The style was fantastic, all the cgi was great and the shrinking scenes really delivered like I hoped they would. The action scenes were all great and it really helped make this film great. Overall this is a great film and a great addition to the marvel films.",8,2,12,3 August 2015
21 Jump Street," A fantastic comedy that is pretty unique
",Having already seen 22 jump Street and really enjoying it I have now seen 21 jump Street and I think it is even better. The premise of this film sees 2 underachieving cops and sent back to high school undercover to get rid of a deadly drug. Jonah hill is known as a comedic actor and he is great in this movie. His character is really different to most things he does and it ends up being really funny. But the real surprise in this film has to be Channing Tatum. Before these jump Street films I never knew how good or funny this guy was but he is fantastic in this movie and is also really funny. I liked the unique directions his character took and it helps that his chemistry with hill is amazing. Jonah hills love interest was good in the movie and was more then just a simple character and was actually believable in the film. Dave franco was also pretty good and had some funny moments too. Ice cube is the police captain and he was really funny in the film. I really enjoyed every scene he has in this film. Now the story of the them going back to high school was great and I liked how as time passes things change with stereotypes and they played on that in this movie. The only negative is that towards the end there is a villain reveal and it comes across as unnecessary and easy to predict but that is really my only negative with the film. The script is one of the best in recent memory. They totally make fun of themselves and say what the audiences think about reboots and the films premise. All the films jokes hit me and all the dramatic scenes really worked too. The style was great in this film. The action scenes were well done and also stayed in touch with the tone of the film which is important. Overall this is a fantastic comedy that everyone should see.,9,0,1,26 August 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," a great film that sometimes doesn't get the credit it deserves
","When talking about the first phase marvel films a lot of people see this film as the weakest I though am not one of these people because I think this film is great. This film is set in ww2 with Steve rogers wanting to fight for his country but being held back because of his size, until he is given the super soldier serum and given the chance to fight for his country. Now Chris Evans has history in comic book films as he was the human torch in the fantastic 4 films, now even though there aren't very good films I thought he did a really good job in them and boy he is even better here. The problem with captain America is that he is a boyscout a lot of the times in the comics and sometimes a joke, but in this film I thought Evans delivered the right amount of heart and action to the character to make even us who aren't American route for him. The supporting cast mostly did a great job too, Haley atwell plays agent Peggy carter and her chemistry with Evans is really good with it feeling so natural and realistic so she did a really good job. Also tommy lee Jones did a great job as the colonel with good comic relief that never went overboard because he kept it serious sometimes. Now I must say Hugo weaving was absolutely perfect as the red skull and he plays the character so well with him being truly evil and looking like he is having fun with the role. The one slight negative is Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes as I felt his character is underdeveloped so the audience don't really care about him. The story is alright with the way cap is treated being great and going different to what I expected. But the overall plot of the villain seemed weak and not enough to convince me That the story is great. The script is fantastic with the right amount of humour and drama to create a really organic feel to the film that should be applauded. The style us okay with captain America looking great and his costume is awesome, but the fact that there is laser beams and sci fi elements in this film really annoys me as it is so against what the film stands for and takes me out of it. Overall this is a great film that will entertain everybody.",8,2,3,19 October 2014
American Hustle," over-hyped but still solid
","I have heard a lot of good things about this film and I must say this film is over-hyped and overrated but that does not mean it is bad it is in fact pretty solid. This film documents a couple of con artists having to work with the FBI to con important members of the hierarchy of new jersey while dealing with their own problems. Now this film is really co led by Christian bales and Amy Adams and both do a really good job and prove that they still have great acting abilities. The supporting cast also does a really good job with what they are given. Bradley cooper is the FBI operative they work with and he has great chemistry with Adams and bale, who provides another look inside this group. Jeremy Renner is my favourite character in the film and his role in this film proves just how solid an actor he truly is. Jennifer Lawrence is also in this film and she is good even though I do believe her character should have had a lesser role. There was also some fun cameos like Louis ck who was a good comedic character in this film. However, for all the great acting in this film the story just annoys the he'll out of me. This film just concentrates on too many people and really lacks focus throughout which really hurts the films narrative. The script is also a bit of a mixed bag in my opinion because the dialogue between the characters is really good but it also suffers from trying to be a little bit too funny and not truthfully succeeding in this department. The style is also a bit of a mixed bag with it being lavish and bright which is cool it just is over the top for this story really. Overall this is a solid hustle film but it is not worthy of all the Oscar buzz it has.",7,0,2,19 September 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Fantastic finale to this terrific trilogy
","This was one of the best endings to a trilogy of films I have seen with all the three films standing up as great action films with a deep narrative. Matt Damon is once again Jason Bourne and he kills it in this role in all the films including this one, but as the sequel you will need to see the other films before this one. In this film Bourne is back and he is looking for the last of his memory back which leads him to encounter both the new main antagonist Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) and old ally/enemy Pam Landy (Joan Allen). Vosen is an extremely interesting character that owns the screen when he is on and he is the newest freshest face to take on Jason Bourne adding to the intrigue to this film. There are some problems with the shaky cam during fight sequences but that is really the only issue. This film does look at themes that weren't explored in either of the films before but they also leave out themes that were which were interesting but this film has enough to it for it to be awesome and worthy of all the praise that it is getting. The ending of this film is tense and provides the viewer the great ending this film deserves.",9,0,0,4 March 2014
Nightcrawler," a fantastic suspense thriller that has one of the best performances in recent memory
","I had heard allot of good things about this film and also Jake Gyllenhaals performance and I must say both of them are fantastic. The premise of the film sees an unemployed man decide to become a crime watch camera man for TV news and when he becomes really good at it he breaks the law to get the best possible shot. Now this is easily Jake Gyllenhaals best performance and this is possibly the most interesting character in film all of this year. His performance blurs the line between protagonist and antagonist as he really portrays both in this film. The supporting cast is good for the most part, renne Russo plays the TV executive he is working with and she does a great job with their chemistry being great. Bill Paxton is in the film in a smaller role but he does a great job in his villainous role. The only problem is the guy who is Gyllenhaals assistant I just don't like the actor and I didn't like him in this film either. The story is also great in the in the film with Gyllenhaals story being great and his character evolving as the film goes on. Also the film looks at the corruption of the news and what people are like involved in it. The script is fantastic and everything that Gyllenhaal says is great and the script makes his character as interesting as he is and the overall drama of the film. The style of the film is also great, the streets of California haven't looked better and it fully encapsulates the film. Overall this is a fantastic film that I would advise anybody to see.",9,1,2,14 January 2015
Oblivion," Good sci-fi Journey but with many problems
","Going into watching this film I was hoping for a good new sci-fi universe with a good story and characters. Well I got some of what I wanted and some that I didn't. The idea of this film is incredibly cool with the survivors against this mysterious alien species that destroyed the Earth. All the vehicles, machines and weapons design is intriguing and I would very much like to see these designs be continued. The majority of the narrative is solid, however this film never really hits the emotional response that it was going for and there are huge plot holes towards the end of the film which left me scratching my head. Also most of the performances in this film including Tom cruise are pretty average, but the best performance is definitely by Morgan Freeman and a big negative is that Freeman isn't in the film enough in my opinion. This film had some good action sequences but not really an interesting foe, it can also drag at places. However this film is above average because of its style, interesting universe and Morgan Freeman, I believe this film could have been improved by having him more in the film.",6,0,0,15 February 2014
The Bourne Identity," The real life version of James Bond
","This film is simply in my opinion fantastic. When I watch an action spy film I believe that apart from the Daniel Craig James Bond films there shouldn't be this idea of cool gadgets smart cars and endless women. This is the most appealing part of The Bourne identity for me, I enjoy action films a lot and with there being no gadgets, no real nice cars and only 1 female I got exactly what I wanted. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne a disgruntled man who has been shot twice and is rescued with no memory which leads to this story of finding himself. Damon is solid in this film he is tough when in fights with enemies but shows that he is a human being when treating others allied with him. You feel sorry for him in the situation he is in even though he is clearly a dangerous human being. He encounters Franka Potente who plays the character Maria who helps him and I believe in this crazy situation the chemistry between the two characters is good and believable with the distressing predicament with the government after them. Another positive is the fact that this film is mostly based in Paris which is nice cause it isn't London or the USA which is refreshing. This film is Awesome and if you like fighting spy films then this is a must watch film.",9,0,1,28 February 2014
Baby Driver," A fantastic unique film
","After seeing the trailers for this film and being a big fan of the director Edgar wright I was really excited to see baby driver and I will say that this film really delivered. The premise of the film sees a getaway driver who needs music to concentrate try and get even with his mob boss and move on with his life. Ansel elgort plays baby in this film and he really owns the role, his physical performance makes his character interesting to watch. He doesn't have lots of dialogue but what he has he really sells and I really cared about his character as he develops in this film. Lily James plays his love interest in this film and she was really good in this film. I really enjoyed watching there chemistry together and I found there relationship fun to watch in this film. Kevin spacey plays the mob boss in this film and surprise he is great in this film, he provides a lot of humour to the role but i liked his and baby's relationship in the film and how it developed quite dramatically. Jon hamm is in this film and he does a great job in this film as a more honourable criminal that fills his job well. Jamie foxx is in this film and he definitely provides the most fun crazy performance in this film that will make you laugh. He has the best lines and the best humour in this film and he sells the craziness of his character very well. The story has a decent love story in it that I actually wanted to see succeed, also for the first hour I was really into the criminal element to the film. However, I felt like the third act felt a little short on what I wanted to see, without spoilers I can only say I didn't see as much as I would have liked to. The script is written expertly with really sharp dialogue, the humour is quick witted and the drama does work when it is used. The style has a lot of great action scenes especially as you would expect with its driving scenes which are excellent. There is a great use of music in this film and it really adds to give this film a huge personality. Overall this is a fantastic fun unique film that I think has to be seen and appreciated especially in this busy summer.",9,15,28,3 July 2017
Justice League," A good film that brings dc's best heroes together
","So after man of steel everyone was ready for the eventuality that a justice league movie would happen and now it has, and it was fun if not flawed in its execution. The premise of the film sees Batman and wonder woman assembling a team to take on a threat stronger then any of them on there own. Ben affleck reprises his role as Bruce wayne/batman in this film and he was good. He didn't stand out as much as he did in batman vs superman but his character has developed since then and it is interesting seeing him trying to develop into this better person and it works well. Gal gadot is back as wonder woman and she is great in this role, she owns all the action scenes and she has a real presence about her on screen that helps her stand out. To the newcomers I am a big fan of the flash TV series so I was sceptical about having a new flash but I really liked ezra Miller as Barry Allen in this film. He might be too over the top in this film for some people but for me he really was the energy and fast paced character that the flash would be and I liked his fun performance. Ray Fisher plays cyborg and he was probably the most interesting character in the film as you see him attempt to get to grips with his pretty new situation and it was great to watch him try and adapt with everybody in the film. Jason mamoa is aquaman and I enjoyed his lovable rogue quality to the character, but I feel he is the most underused of the members of the league. The villain steppenwolf is functional but doesn't stand out as being a memorable villain at all. There are a few smaller roles that were well done too that I won't spoil if you don't know about them. The story in the film is okay, I really liked the dynamic of the league which was important as I found every member of the team to be fun and likable. However, the overall plot is incredibly formulaic and by the numbers in a bad way. There just isn't any twists or turns that I didn't expect and it bummed me out a bit. The script has a lighter tone to some of the other dc films with quite a few of the jokes landing. I didn't really feel like the drama delivered though, I never really felt like the world was truly in danger and I feel like the emphasis on humour too that away. The style of the film has pacing that moves quickly so you have to pay attention, I also liked a lot of the action scenes. This film does feel a bit choppy though, it feels like a few parts of the film are missing and some of the cgi looks unfinished and rushed out of the door, which I'm guessing can be blamed on the shift of directors in the late stages. Overall I enjoyed this film even though it isn't as good as maybe everyone wanted I feel like it is another solid film in the DC universe.",8,0,1,17 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Epic phenomenon on all levels of Middle Earth
","This film is easily one of my favourite of all time and it ranks up with the very best films ever made. The story sees the Dark Lord Sauron create an evil ring to control middle earth until he was destroyed, 3000 years later the ring has found it's way to Frodo Baggins who along with the fellowship are tasked with the mission of destroying the ring in the lands of Mordor. All the acting in this film is great with Elijah Wood starring as Frodo as he really made us feel connected with the character and make him feel a hero who needed support because he was the underdog. The rest of the group is also fantastic with Ian Mckellen as Gandalf The Grey and he is just so wise and great as the dominant Wizard who is also fun to be around. Viggo Mortensen is crucial with his great performance as Aragorn because his character is crucial to the story and is just like Frodo because we look through this character. Also Sean Bean does a great job as Boromir with him being the character that really struggles to grasp the addiction of the ring and really provide an interesting character. The story is great and I liked how a prologue was used to show the back story, also this film combines character moments, story, heartfelt moments and action incredibly well as this film never feels boring as it is always involved in one way or another. Also it has one of the most dramatic endings in film history that normally almost drives me to tears and also makes you want to just go and watch the second film. The script is also fantastic as it really has a good blend of epicness and humour that really balances it out well. The style is absolutely incredible and I have never seen a film look better then the Lord Of the rings films as it is absolutely breathtaking and helps with the epic tone. Also I think this is the most epic selection on soundtracks ever created and they all fit the films superbly. Overall this film is close to perfection and really builds up the anticipation for the rest of the trilogy.",10,0,0,4 March 2014
Man of Steel," The Best Superman film of all time and truly sets up DC to set up their cinematic universe
","I am a huge comic book fan of both DC and Marvel but I have never been a huge fan of Superman, I always believe that he has been treated above everybody else and seen as unbeatable and unrealistic. However, after this film I am now fully behind Superman and where they go in the future. This film starts off on krypton and it shows the devastation of the planet while Kal-El aka Superman is sent to Earth to set up a new future until an old enemy from the past returns to reclaim Krypton's future. Now first of all the performances are all superb Henry Cavill kills it as Superman and he is the perfect cast for this new realistic Superman for this film and future films. Amy Adams is strong and superb as Lois Lane and really stands up to the male characters in this film, and the villain General Zod is played magnificently he is evil and menacing but his best quality is the fact that he has a true reason to be evil to save his people. This makes him a relatable villain as he is just trying to do his best for his people and he truly believes what he is doing is right. Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Diane Lane as Martha Kent all excel in their role and truly show their loving nature for the son making them relatable to the audience. People complain this is just an action film but they are wrong as the flashbacks of Superman's origin as Clark Kent makes us feel sympathy for this God and show us just how much this character has had to go through. This story really emphasises Superman being an emphasis of hope against Zod's emphasis of control. As this film progresses there are more and more heroes Martha Kent becomes a hero, Perry White becomes a hero, the US Military become heroes and Lois Lane becomes a hero because of Superman's influence. The link to Hope is even more emphasised by Hans Zimmer's soundtrack which is fantastic and truly fits this new superman installing hope, also this is one of the best Sci-Fi films I have seen as a while and reminds me of such forms of media as Star Wars and Mass Effect which adds to the great style of this film. Now the action is awesome the opening on Krypton, the battle of Smallville and the final battle between Superman and Zod is the films best thing and also emphasises the realistic destruction of this film that would really happen if aliens did invade Earth. There is an action committed by Superman at the end of the movie that is controversial but I accept it as this is a different Superman to Christopher Reeves or the comics giving us a new fresh Superman. Now the main negative for me is the product placement, there is about 7 times where I saw it and it truly takes me out of the film and feels like a bit of a long advertisement there is also some shaky cam but it isn't as much as critics believe. The Dialogue is quite rigid at times which doesn't help the actors or actresses. This film is a phenomenal reintroduction to Superman and I am highly positive for the sequel and future films with this cast and a certain other hero.",9,8,13,6 June 2014
The Revenant," A great film about man vs nature.
","After being nominated for 12 Oscars I knew I had to watch the revenant and it is a great film. The premise sees a man seek revenge after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his men. Leonardo di caprio is one of the best actors around and he continues in this film, this is probably his most physical performance ever and I really did feel sorry for his character as he went through this emotional journey. Tom hardy plays the villain in this film and he is great in this film being a rugged bad guy who is truly menacing. Domnhall gleeson fresh off of his appearance in star wars the force awakens is really good in this film and delivered a good secondary character to root for. This is definitely will poulters best role ever and he was really good in this film. The story of the conflict between di caprio and hardy is really good and easily the most interesting part of the film. However, there is some bizarre secondary plot involving some aboriginal people that just really doesn't fit in the film. The script had some decent dramatic dialogue, but it does lack the depth of some other films that holds it back. The style of this film is incredible, the action scenes are crisp and smooth and the cinematography being beautiful. Also the score totally encapsulates this films tone. Overall this is a great film that deserves its plaudits.",8,6,11,15 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," A great historical biopic
","With the combination of steven Spielberg and tom hanks for this film I had high hopes and this film delivered. The premise of the film sees an insurance lawyer hired to defend a kgb spy and eventually lead an exchange for an American spy. Now tom hanks is one of the best actors to have ever lived and he continues that in this film. I believe that he will be nominated for an Oscar because of his truly heartwarming phenomenal performance. His character was so interesting, quick witted and deep that I was always rooting for him in this film to succeed. But equally as impressive was mark rylance as the Russian spy, this guy was fantastic in his role and his chemistry with hanks was fantastic. However, I felt like there were some missed opportunities like I didn't find hanks family interesting and I also felt like the American pilot didn't have enough about him that made me care. I loved the story of hanks and rylances relationship and how it builds throughout the movie. I also liked the fact that the film has allot of shades of grey which is refreshing in a film likes this. However, I wasn't a fan of the American pilots whole story which made me care less about the overall film. The script is great with the drama and humour being used very well to create or leviate tension. The style of the film was beautiful with some great visual effects and some great tension helped by the camera work and the score. Overall this is a great film that if you are interested in the subject matter you should see.",8,1,3,3 December 2015
Split," A great psychological thriller
","I have heard good buzz about this film and I wanted to see this film even though I am not a big fan of horror films. But I really enjoyed this film especially since it is actually a psychological thriller instead of a horror film. The premise of this film sees three young girls get kidnapped by a man who has 23 different personalities. James McAvoy plays the guy with the different personalities and he is absolutely amazing in this film, this is one of the most unique performances I have ever seen. He plays all these different personalities flawlessly, he has many different personalities he has to be and he gives different unique performances for each one and it proves he is one of the best actors around today. Anna Taylor joy plays the main girl in the film and she does a great job, you care about her situation and you want to see her survive the ordeal because she has a bit of edge to her and it makes her a pretty interesting character in this film. The other girls she is captured with are pretty good in the film too and I thought McAvoy's doctor was good in the film as well. The story has a great story seeing these girls especially the main one trying to survive this unique experience while trying to use some of McAvoy's nicer personalities against him. However, there are really pointless flashbacks used in this film about the main girl and they just don't do anything for the film and come across as pointless and just filler. Also I think too much time was spent with the doctor that could have meant more time with McAvoy and the girls which is more interesting. The script has great dialogue that especially McAvoy delivers superbly, there is allot of drama but subtle humour as well that does work. The style of the film is very slow paced but I thought it was interesting for the majority. Unfortunately there is just a few too many exposition scenes with the doctor that I didn't care for and the last 20 mins did feel more like a generic horror film that did upset me. Overall this film is a great watch if you like slower more intelligent thriller films then this is a must watch for you.",8,1,9,23 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," An above average but ultimately disappointing film
","I have almost finished my harry potter series an I have just watched the deathly hallows part one and ultimately like it's predecessor the half blood prince it is alright but I believe it is a bit disappointing. The premise of the film sees harry, Ron and Hermione going after the horcruxes that give voldermort his power. Daniel Radcliffe is known for his role in these films and he has really matured into a great character. Harry is much darker in this film because of the events of the previous film and Radcliffe does a really good job of making us buy the pressure that his character is under. Hermione and Ron are more pivotal in this film and they are great, you can tell they are growing closer together but they still argue like an old married couple. The three characters chemistry together and development is clearly the best part of this film. Unfortunately though the rest of the supporting characters aren't given any time to shine and come across as forced cameos for the most part. The story has some great character development between our heroes and you really want to see them succeed. However, it does come across as a basic treasure hunt an it just feels like setup for the next movie. The script is allot darker and has some great drama that you actually believe. But it does lack the humour that has made these characters more relatable. The style of this film is better then the previous, there are way more action scenes in this film with the darker tone working for the action scenes. But like the majority of these films it does drag a little bit and this film does slow down at a point quite allot. Overall I thought this was an alright film but it does feel like a setup for the next film which I hope is fantastic.",6,1,1,16 September 2016
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," a really poor sequel that shouldn't have been made
",after the phenomenal sequel judgement day it took twelve years for the third film in the franchise and I wish it never happened and they should have left it with just the first two films. The premise of this film sees a terminator sent back in time to protect John Connor and his future wife from being killed by a future terminator and also to try and prevent judgement day from truly happening. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the terminator and even though he does an alright job this is not the same performance as the terminator as before. He just seems like he is exhausted at times and can't be bothered and this was the first film where they really started to parody the terminator and make him a joke. They recast John Connor with actor Nick stahl and he just was not a good fit for the character. I understand where the character was he just didn't portray him very well and he didn't develop at all in the film and i never saw him getting closer to the leader of the resistance. Claire Danes is in the film and she is alright in the film and develops in the film with her performance being good. Also the villain the TX was a good villain and the character was perfect as the evil terminator of the film. The story didn't work either with it becoming way too convoluted and to a certain extent it takes away from the previous films. It has some decent ideas but really fails to deliver them and I feel like the characters didn't grow on me that much. The script is awful with the dialogue not hitting with any of the characters and they don't allow the characters to expand and become more interesting like previous films characters. There are some pretty cool action scenes like the truck scene and the church scene but then there are some over the top cgi scenes that just look really bad. Overall this is a poor film that you won't like unless you are a huge terminator fan and very forgiving.,3,1,6,1 July 2015
The Shining," An Epic Horror and Thriller that has lasted all these years
","When it comes to the most acclaimed Horror movies of all time one that is always mentioned is The Shining and with Doctor Sleep out today I thought now is the best time to review The Shining. The premise of the film sees a family live in a hotel, whihc causes the father to grow impatient and evenyually crazed and violent. Jack Nicholson plays the lead in this film and it is one of the best performances possibly ever, he is super charismatic and creepy in this film, it is a truly memorable performance and one that people still hail to this very day. Shelley Duvall plays his wife in this film and she does an excellent job in this film, they compliment each other very well and I thought she did a great job selling the teriffied nature that this film puts her character in. Everybody else did a great job in the film and provided some dcent work when the film wasn't focusing on the two main characters. The story is so open to interpretation, you see Nicholson's character go through so much in this film and the story doesn't give you clear answers and it is open to what each people really believe. The ending is fantastic and plays into the ambiguety of the film which fits the tone of the film. The script is great with some really unique and charismatic dialogue that adds drama but also some weird humour that makes Nicholson's character feel very deep. The style of the film keeps you guessing throughout and manages to keep the film feeling suspensful' and waiting for something to really go down. Overall this is an Epic Suspensful Horror Film that is one of the most iconic films of all time and if you love Horror you will love this film.",10,0,2,31 October 2019
Warrior," An epic film that is about more then fighting
","I have heard nothing but good things about warrior and now I have seen it and boy does it live up to the hype in my opinion. The premise of this film sees two brothers who are both down on their luck enter a ufc tournament which they both look to win. Now joal Edgerton has had an interesting career to say the least but he is fantastic in this film. He is the everyday hero that we root for because he is relatable and the one character that is a good person and that you really like in this film. Tom hardy is also phenomenal in this film, from the very first time you see him you can tell he is damaged and has allot of anger and he is so mysterious that it makes him a truly fascinating character. Nick nolte plays the father and he was also great in this film and you really felt the pain in his character and you feel for him at times even though you do realise he has his issues. Frank grillo is really good as edgertons trainer and the rest of the supporting cast were great too. The story is fantastic, this film is about a broken family and you believe everything and there are some moments where you want to cheer and where you want to cry and that is due to a great story. The script is great, the dialogue made all the characters interesting and the writing helped make it great to. The style if the ufc fights was fantastic with all the hits feeling real and impactful. Overall this is a truly fantastic film that should definitely be seen.",10,1,3,19 August 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," An epic sequel that improves in every way
","In preparation for terminator genysis I am rewatching the previous films in the franchise and I have now just watched again the best terminator film and one of my favourite films ever judgement day. The film is set 10 years after the first film and skynet send a terminator back to the 1990s to kill John Connor as a kid so Connor from the future reprogrammes a terminator to protect him as a kid. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the t-800 and instead of being a villain he is the hero and a protector of John Connor. And he was perfect for the role, he nailed the robot mentality but also invoked allot of humour and emotion out of the terminator that he really couldn't do in the first film. He is also awesome in the action scenes which was much better in this film. Now I have to admit the kid who plays John Connor is the only real disappointment for me, I mean he isn't terrible but he just doesn't really shine allot even though him and Schwarzenegger have good chemistry on screen. Linda Hamilton is back and boy is her character different in this film, Sarah Connor is now a militarized soldier who is one f the best action stars in recent memory. Her character has allot of layers to her and she really sells her characters troubling situation. They introduce the man that will eventually cause judgement day and he was an interesting character that added a different dynamic to the film. And of course the villain the t-1000 played by Robert Patrick. He goes down as one of the most intimidating villains in film history and his liquid metal effects are legendary in film. He was the perfect villain for this film and he will go down as one of the greatest villains ever. The story is simplistic and similar to the first film but it is just much more in every way. You see the character development of the terminator and Sarah Connor so much that they become some of the most interesting characters in action film history. The film has layers to it with all the story arcs being interesting and even when the t-1000 isn't on screen you are fully invested in what else is going on. The script is great with the mix of humour and drama really adding depth to the characters and making you care about the characters when the action goes down. The style in this film is completely breath taking, as the action is just continuous and makes this one of the best action packed films ever. Also the obvious t-1000 special effects make this film even more legendary and puts the style on the levels of greats like Jurassic park and star wars. Overall this is an excellent film which is a must see if you fancy yourself an action and sci-fi fan.",10,2,5,22 June 2015
We're the Millers," A pretty funny film
","This film has a really funny 1 hour film, however, there are some parts of this film where I believe that the creative run out of ideas for the other 30/40 minutes with filler stuff. The film documents an experienced drug dealer lose his stash and cash so his boss makes him travel to Mexico to get a stash for him, so to achieve this he sets up a fake family with a stripper, a runaway and a nerd to achieve this drug dealing mission. Now Jason Sudeikis is great as the lead and really carries this film with his great dialogue. The other members of the family are good and the chemistry between the four members of the family is really good and provides the core of this film. Now because it is a comedy some people believe that the story is not important but I disagree. This story is pretty cliché and outside of the great parts there is a few scenes in this film that are pretty useless and really are just there to pad out the films length. The script is obviously good even though I believe most of the dialogue is spontaneous so the script doesn't truly get too many positives. The style of the film is okay but quite cliché with the Mexican setting and just like the script doesn't really add to the film. Overall I enjoyed this film more then Tropic Thunder but not as much as This is the End and even though there are problems this is a funny film.",7,3,5,27 June 2014
Divergent," a good fantasy film that I enjoyed
",With the new film insurgent coming out I though it was about time to see the first film divergent and I was quite surprised as I actually enjoyed this film. This film is set in a dystopian future where the world is split into five different factions for different jobs. Tris is a girl who is what they call a divergent who don't belong to any faction and they are a menace to society so they must be eliminated. Now shailene Woodley plays tris and I haven't seen here in much before but she was really good in this film and I definitely want to see more of her. You feel sympathetic for her character and you believe in her transformation as a character. Theo James plays four her love interest and to be honest yes women will say he is handsome but I don't think he is a great actor and he probably would have been more suited in the twilight franchise. Kate Winslet is a big actress but she was completely underutilized in this film as her role was incredibly small and it doesn't allow you to have any connection with her character at all. It's funny that one guy I did like in this film is Jai Courtney because I have never been a big fan of this guy but this evil role was perfect for him and 8 think he did pull it off well. I like training in films and this film did it well with the transformation of tris being the best part of the film. But they really give you no backstory on the universe you are in and the overall plot isn't really talked about allot and it makes you wonder why we bothered. The script had some really good drama to it towards The end of it but sometimes it was cliché and didn't help the character building. The style of this film was great with the action scenes being shot fantastically and you can see everything that is going on. Overall I enjoyed this film and it definitely makes me want to see insurgent.,7,0,1,21 March 2015
Ender's Game," a great sci fi
","My favourite genre of film is that of sci fi and this is a very good sci fi that I advise everybody gives a shot. This story sees earth barely survive a war with aliens thanks to the heroics of one commander, now the military want a new inspirational commander and they believe young kid ender is the one to fulfill this goal. Now the kid they got to play ender does a fantastic job in the role as he manages to combine the smarts he has with a realistic personality to make us think he is a good leader and that we should be rooting for him all the way. The supporting cast is a mixed bag with Harrison ford doing an awesome job and proving he is a great actor, his chemistry with ender was really goof and their dialogue together felt really natural and flowed well. Another good performance is that of sir Ben kingsley even though he is not in the film that he much he does a good job with the screen time he gets and his chemistry with ender was pretty good too. Now there is a sort of love interest in the film but the actress they got to play the girl wasn't great and they never really committed to it showing that she was a bit of a throwaway character. Another character that annoyed me a bit is enders sister Valentine played by Abigail breslan, and even though she isn't in the film that much her whole point of being in the plot is pointless and I don't like the way her character affected the film. The story is okay I really liked the battle school scenes and I do wish there was more of it, also the Harrison ford relationship part of the plot was done well. But once again I didn't like the whole romance and sister part of the story and I also thought the ending was quite abrupt and not entirely fulfilling. The script is really good with great dialogue scenes with ender, ford and kingsley providing a great launching pad for this film. The style is also great with the tech looking cool and the whole idea of the school system being intriguing ans unique to this sci fi. Overall I really liked enders game and I think anybody who sees this film will feel this way too.",8,1,3,14 October 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A good idea but the execution is just below average
","Now I really do believe that this film's premise is a really good one and there are some positives but I think overall this is a failure of a project. This sees the fairy tale characters of Hansel and Gretel years after the story as witch hunting bounty hunters attempting to stop an evil plot by the witches. Now Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton play Hansel and Gretel and they both do an okay job, now I like both of them in the stuff they have been in but they are not helped in this film by the script. For all the action and fight scenes they were awesome and really did a good job of being bounty hunters, however, the actual acting is pretty poor but they try their best and it helps a little bit. Now Famke Janssen plays the villain witch and I think she did a good job in her role by being as evil as truly possible and looking like she was enjoying the role. But the rest of the supporting cast is poor and underdeveloped, whether it is Renner's love interest, or the troll who helps Arterton or their town associate they are all lacklustre and a big negative in the film. This is also associated with the story because there are a few story arcs but they give no effort into any of them which is annoying cause there was some potential in some of them. The script is also not impressive with the dialogue not being that creative at all and attempting to sabotage the film quite a bit. The style of the film is great with the surprising amount of violence being a good decision to separate this film from others like it. Overall this film is below average and I wish there was a bit more substance to it as the premise was really cool.",4,0,1,31 October 2014
Rocky IV," A great boxing movie
","Continuing my reviews for all the rocky films see me review rocky 4. The premise of the film is that after the death of a close friend he decides to go to Russia to challenge an almost invincible opponent. Sylvester Stallone is back as rocky and he does a good job in this film selling the personal anguish in his character and you understand why he needs this fight. Carl weathers is back as Apollo creed and even though not a huge role he does a good job in this film. This film was Dolph lundgrens break out role as Ivan drago and he was great as the robotic giant and it really worked. However, I thought that the return of Adrian and Paulie didn't come across that well in this film and could have been missing from this film completely. The overall story is pretty emotional and a great dramatic tale of redemption. However, especially towards the start it does feel rushed and a bit like a chunk of the film is missing. The script has some really good drama in it and allot of well placed humour involved. The style of the film is great, the boxing scenes are high impact and filmed brilliantly, same as the well placed training montage. Overall this is a great rocky movie that I would definitely advise seeing.",8,0,0,8 October 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," A fantastic film that keeps this franchise going strong
","After the great film that was mission impossible 3 and the fantastic film that ghost protocol was there was big pressure on the newest film rogue nation to deliver and boy did it possibly making this the most fun and best film in the franchise. This film sees Ethan hunt and his team on the hunt after an anti IMF called the syndicate while the CIA try to track them down. Now Tom cruise is a man who I have allot of respect for and he once again absolutely delivers in this film. Ethan hunt is a great character and you see him going slightly crazy in this film and it makes him an even more interesting character. And obviously for those that don't know he did all his own stunts in this film and he does a phenomenal job in all the action scenes and deserves credit for it. The rest of the cast also do a great job in this film, first of all there is Rebecca Ferguson who I think is a woman you will be seeing more of after this film. She was a multi layered character and had a really interesting dynamic to her and with the rest of the cast. She was also a great action star and only furiosa and black widow come close to her in 2015. Simon pegg is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood and this film truly shows this. He provides a comedic elect to the film without it going to far and is also a great dramatic actor and he is great as Benji in this film. Jeremy Renner and ving Rhames are back for this film and they are also both great in this film and really add a sense of teamwork but you also see that these people have there own philosophy and motivations. Also alec Baldwin and the villain were good in this film and added allot to this film. The story was okay, it starts off well enough and the team dynamic was really good in this film. The CIA part of the film was more interesting to me then the main plot involving the syndicate. I just wanted to know more about the syndicate and their motivations which would have allowed us to care more. Also I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the film. The script was fantastic with allot of greatly well placed humour and the drama all really worked as well and really helped this film flow really well. The style is what we all came to see and I must say the action scenes in the film are utterly fantastic. The plane scene in the trailer is just one of the many phenomenal action scenes in this film that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. Also what I liked is that this film adds allot of tension and action and the combination was executed magnificently. Overall this is a fantastic movie that is really worth seeing in the cinema for the whole experience.",9,2,6,1 August 2015
Spider-Man," The first epic Marvel Film
",This Film was the first real blockbuster of this new comic book generation and the first Comic book film I ever saw. I believe this film has a bit of everything for the comic book fans and just the casual fans to enjoy. This film was especially appealing for me once I heard The Green Goblin was going to be in the film since he is my favourite villain in comic book history and I believe The Goblin was the perfect villain for this film and just added to the overall quality of the film. This film has great action and a narrative that really does make the character of peter parker relatable to the audience and add to the emotional parts of the film which just like the majority of the film. The only small negatives are such things as some slow parts and awkward dialogue portions between Mary Jane and Peter. But there is just too many positives to miss out on this film apart from what I mentioned and the relationship between Harry and Norman Osborne was a great addition to the love story. Overall a fantastic comic book film with just about a bit of everything positive for it.,9,1,2,16 February 2014
Collateral," A fantastic thriller with a unique lead performance
","I have heard rave things about collateral and in preparation for the new mission impossible film I decided to watch it and I'm happy I did because this is a fantastic film. The premise of this film sees a contract killer get into a cab to fulfil a job and ends up in a confrontation of wills with the driver. Now usually in films Tom cruise plays the hero that everybody roots for but in this film he plays a conflicted dark psychopathic character that was just so interesting to watch. Yes he fits the action scenes but his character was really interesting and a deep character that is easily one of cruises best performances. Equally as impressive is Jamie Foxx as max the cab driver, you see this guy evolve as a character throughout the movie and even though he is also flawed he is the character that the audience are meant to relate to and he does a fantastic job at it. Mark ruffalo and jada pinkett Smith are good in this film it is just that you don't really know too much about them and there characters aren't that well fleshed out. The story is enthralling with two different types of thrillers in one film. You have the cab scenes with incredible character depth and dialogue between the two characters that really interests you. Then you also have the LA night time scenes that are also really cool and interesting and add a great backdrop for the movie. The script is fantastic, with all the dialogue being great and really helps make these characters incredibly interesting to watch. The style is great, with the awesome L.A. night scenes being a great backdrop for all the fantastic action scenes especially the one in the night club. Overall this is a fantastic film that is definitely worth a watch.",9,0,1,29 July 2015
Dunkirk," An above average suspenseful war film
","With any Christopher Nolan film I had huge anticipation for Dunkirk and I have now seen it and I thought it was alright but definitely a disappointment. The premise of the film sees 400,000 men stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk, they look for escape by land, air and sea. The lead performer in this film is a new actor called fionn Whitehead and I found his performance to be really bland. He is a character with very few lines and he just comes across as a very boring person with nothing special to make you care about him anymore then anybody else in this film. The supporting cast is full of great actors, mark rylance plays a civilian who has a boat to go rescue survivors and he gives the best performance in this film. His character has depth to him as he goes beyond what Is necessary to try and save people even though it isn't his job and he sells this role with a great performance. Cillian Murphy is really good in this film, his altercations with rylance is the best character development in the film. Tom hardy plays a pilot in this film and even though he is mostly just in the cockpit he gives an intense performance that is good for what is required. Kenneth branagh is in this film as a captain of the military and he gives a good emotional performance in the role. The story in the film is pretty simple and it does work well seeing these different people trying to survive this dangerous situation. However, this film lacks any real humanity to the majority of the characters, I don't remember anybody's name in this film or if there is anything unique to them that I should have care about. The script has very little amounts of dialogue in it but it has some pretty decent dramatic dialogue especially between rylance and Murphy. But there isn't really enough dialogue to give it more compliments and no humour at all which isn't big negative for this film but was noticeable. The style of the film is absolutely breathtaking, the visuals are incredible especially when it comes to the fighter pilots where the action is breathtaking and visually stunning. Overall there are certain aspects of this film that are really good but I don't think it really is a must see film.",6,4,9,24 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A good darker take on these films
","I have now seen the third film in the harry potter franchise the prisoner of Azkaban and this is another pretty good film. The premise sees harry back at Hogwarts when an old ally of he who should not be named escapes the prison of Azkaban looking for harry. Daniel Radcliffe seems to really mature into the role of harry potter in this film and I really thought he did a great job in this film. His character really develops allot in this film and you really grow to care about him in this series so far. Ron and Hermione aren't as important in this film in my opinion but they both are fun characters and the three wizards chemistry is great. Gary oldman plays Sirius black and he does a good job in this film I just wish his character had more time to be developed because he wasn't in the film that much. David thewlis plays the new professor of defence against the dark arts lupin and I really liked his relationship with harry throughout this film. Alan rickman has slightly more to do as snape and I like his interesting character and think he can do more in these films. Michael gambon is the new Dumbledore and I thought he did a really good job in the film. The story has harry looking into the darker parts of magic and I found his development as a character was great. However, I feel like this film takes too long to get to it's most interesting story. Also the film takes some cheap ways to solve some of its problems. The script has some good drama in it especially with Harry's situation. The humour is better in this film, however, the conflicting tone of the dialogue comes across as messy. The style has a much darker tone to it and I liked it quite allot especially the addition of the dementers. However, like the previous two films I just feel the pacing of the film is messy. These films seem to want to include everything from the books and it comes across as overly bloated. Overall I think this is a decent film and it is a worthy addition to the franchise.",7,0,2,31 July 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man," A new fresher tale on much loved comic book character
","I first watched this film on a plane to New York and I must say I wasn't that impressed. But I have now watched this film for the first time at home and I thought this film is great and a fresh take on Spider Man. This film is slightly familiar because most people know the character of Peter Parker as Spider Man but this film stays fresh with a new love interest, a new time period and a new villain. Now this film will be compared to the original spider man films and where I preferred the first two Sam Remy films over this one I still believe that this film does things better then those films and some things worse. My favourite part of the film is the chemistry and relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone having great chemistry. Also I felt the Lizard was a good villain for this opening film as it links to parts in peter's character that hadn't been explored in previous films. However, I still believe the Green Goblin and Doc Ock were better in the previous films. This film does a few things in it that just angered me and is the main reason this film does not have a higher rating from me. I must say though this film and all the marketing has got me so amped for the sequel and this Spider Man franchise could go on to rival that of X-Men and the Marvel cinematic Universe in the future.",8,2,4,16 April 2014
The Lego Movie," A Legendary bag of laughs
","I got to be honest when I heard that a Lego movie was coming out I had no interest in seeing it. To be honest I only went to go see it because of word of mouth form critics and people I knew and am I glad that I spent 2 hours of my life watching this film. This film is not just for young kids this film has so much humour in it that kids, teenagers and adults alike will love. The voice acting of Liam Neeson, Chris Pratt and Will Arnett in particular is my favourite with all the voice acting absolutely fantastic. With properties such as Batman, Superman and Star Wars this film is so much fun and is easily one of the best times I have had in a cinema in a while. It also has one of the most catchy theme songs ever which adds to the overall greatness of this film and makes it absolutely legendary. The narrative is fairly simple with the character of Emmet (Pratt) given the daunting task of being the chosen one with allies such as Batman (Arnett) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) to defeat the evil President business (Will Ferrell). This narrative also helps with some of the great jokes and overall fun of the film.",9,1,4,21 February 2014
Aliens," An epic sci fi action film
","I really enjoy alien as a film but I have to admit that I totally love aliens and believe it is a better movie and one of the best movies ever. The premise of the film sees Ripley get picked up years after alien, along with a group of marines she goes back to lv426 to investigate the new missing colony there. Sigourney weaver is back as Ellen Ripley and she is even better in this film then the first and she was even nominated for an Oscar for this role. She is one of the most action packed strong woman in a film ever and she delivers such a strong but lovable performance in this film that makes you truly care about her character. The rest of the cast is also absolutely awesome, the late great bill Paxton plays Hudson in this film and he is amazing in this film, he has the best lines in the film and I loved the humour that he brings to his role. Michael biehn from terminator plays corporal hicks and he is really good in this film , he has a rugged but charming characteristic to him and I liked his performance. The character of Vasquez is absolutely great she is the biggest badass in this film and I absolutely beloved her character. The character of newt is really important to the film and I absolutely love her relationship with Ripley an thought it really brought the emotion to this film. The story in this film is pretty simple like alien, but I give this film credit for doing something different then the first film. The chemistry between the team is great to watch and you truly care about the characters as they take on the xenomorphes. Similar to alien there are a few interesting twists in this story that help make it feel unique as well. The script has fantastic dialogue in it with humour that makes these characters really fun to watch and build the relationships between the squad. The drama towards the end of the film really works as well and helps build the emotion. The style of the film has some of the most awesome action scenes seen in recent memory that adds suspense and keeps the action up. Overall I love aliens and I think it is a must see especially if you appreciate action films.",10,5,7,3 May 2017
Now You See Me," A good magic heist film
","In preparation for seeing the sequel I have finally seen now you see me and I did enjoy this film. The premise of the film sees a group of four magicians rob banks while on show. A cop attempts to take them down even though he doesn't understand. Jesse eisenberg plays the head magician and this role really did fit him. He was eccentric but in the right way as you understand the complexity of a magicians mind. Woody harrelson is good in this film with a very charismatic performance but once again for this film his eccentricities work for the film. Ilsa fisher and Dave Franco are the other two four horseman and even though they have less to do they both do a good job as well in the roles and the whole group work well together. Mark ruffalo plays the cop going after the group and he does a good job in the film and it is interesting to see him try to tackle the group. Melanie Laurent plays ruffalo's partner in the film and she does a good job with her character having some good depth to her and a good chemistry with ruffalo. Michael caine and Morgan freeman are also in this film and they do good jobs in the roles that they have. The story has an interesting heist element to it and I liked watching the investigation into the group by ruffalo and Laurent. However, there are quite a few things that don't really make sense. Also there is a twist towards the end of the film that doesn't really add up when you think about it. The script has some interesting dialogue in it, its just nothing really stands out and adds character depth. The style has some good chase scenes and also the magic tricks are visually very impressive. However, most of it isn't very plausible and it does take a bit away from the magnificence of the tricks. Overall this is a good film that has some interesting things in it.",7,0,1,8 July 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The ultimate X-Men film that rivals being the greatest comic book film ever
","I am a huge X-Men fan but I can accept there have been some bad films in the franchise which is why this film was completely necessary and is easily the best X-Men film ever made and one of the greatest comic book films ever made. The story sees the X- Men fighting a war against the sentinels in the future so to stop the war from ever happening old magneto and professor Xavier send wolverine back to 1973 to meet their younger versions and convince them to help stop mystique from causing the war. Now some people were complaining about Hugh jackman leading this film but this is easily my favourite of his performances as wolverine and I want him to stay at it for many more years. The supporting cast is also excellent with Jennifer Lawrence stepping up and assuming the real role of mystique. She is the moral centre of the film as you can see she is properly conflicted and you understand why and feel sympathy for her character. James mcavoy and Michael fassbender return as the young Xavier and magneto and they kill it, they make the characters really interesting and dynamic with their chemistry totally owning this film. Patrick Stewart and Ian mckellen are back as the older versions of the characters and their relationship is slightly different in this film and their chemistry also is great. Peter dinklage is great as trask, Nicholas hoult is great as beast and Evan Peters is awesome as quicksilver which was a great surprise. Time travel stories can sometimes be convoluted and messy but with the return of Bryan singer I think this film did it perfectly. The transition of the future and past really works and makes you care about all the characters in both time periods. I also really liked everybody's individual journeys in this film and I think some of them aren't over and will continue in apocalypse. The script is great with the best mix of drama and comedy I have ever seen in a comic book film and that has to be truly commended. The style is great with the future scenes really working and the tone of it being perfect for the situation. Also the 1970s scenes style works too and makes you feel the period and also feel engrossed in the story. Overall this is the best X-Men film ever and one of the best films of 2014",10,2,3,29 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," An epic super hero clash
","This was easily my most anticipated film of 2016 and I am happy to report that this film truly delivers with epic proportions. The premise of the film sees after multiple catastrophes the avengers are told to they work for the governments of the world. Some super heroes led by iron man agree with this, whereas some of them led by captain America don't, This cause a massive rift in the avengers. Chris evans reprises his role as Steve rogers/captain America and he is fantastic in this film. He brings such depth to this character and you truly care about him and you are behind him as this film progresses. However, then there's Tony stark/iron man played by Robert Downey Jr who is so great because you are truly torn between who to root for because he is so likable and you understand both of their points of view. This film sees the introduction of black panther played by chadwick boseman who is phenomenal, you see his character develop so much throughout this film and you see just how much of an awesome interesting character he is. This film sees the return of Sebastian stan as the winter soldier and he is such a tragic character in this film, you sense the difficulties the character has been through and you want to help him like cap does. Everybody does a great job from falcon to scarlet witch to vision to black widow but I loved ant-man and spider mans roles in this film. Ant man added allot of really well placed humour to the film which was needed and this is probably the best on screen representation of spider man ever, enough said about that. The story involves allot of conflict and based on previous films you understand why the events are happening in this film. The conflict is handled very well and there is a villain who has a plan that I believed and understood. The script is great with a fantastic blend of humour and drama that other comic book films don't know how to do. The style has great action scenes that show off the powers of each character. There is one sequence that is the greatest superhero brawl ever put on screen. Also the film is long but I thought the pacing was great and the film flowed very well. Overall I loved captain America civil war and believe it will be hard to find a better film this year.",10,12,26,1 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A good fun wizarding film
","After watching all of the harry potter films in preparation I was excited for fantastic beasts and where to find them an I did enjoy this film quite a bit but it's probably not as good as fans want it to be. The premise of the film sees the adventures of wizard of newt Scamander 70 years before harry potter as he tries to recapture his beasts that are let loose in new York. Eddie redmayne plays newt and he does a very good job in the role. You believe him as this wizard as he bumbles his way through this film as a loving wizard that you can believe in and enjoy watching. Dan fogler plays the human with no magic an he is easily the funniest characters in this film and possibly the most interesting character in the film. He is the most relatable character in the film and I really enjoyed watching him. Colin Farrell plays the magic detective in this film and he is a pretty interesting character as he is on the hunt for Scamander and the beasts. I particular liked the scenes he had with Ezra millers character who was also good in this film as it was interesting to watch. Katherine waterson and Samantha Morton Play a couple of witches in this film and they were good but mostly used as love interests that didn't have loads to do in this film. The story has some interesting moments with the search for a dark magic that involves Farrell. But overall I felt like there was too much going on in this film and some of the story arcs felt unnecessary. The hunt for the beasts tries to connect to the dark magic but it feels like two separate stories that don't connect very well. The script has allot of humour in it and for the majority of it I found this film funny. Unfortunately, the drama jut doesn't hit and you don't really buy any of it. The style has some absolutely beautiful creature designs that were really interesting to see. Also the use of magic was great to see and very unique but familiar to the other films. But this film has a few pacing problems in it and the film lulls to attempt to set up sequels and nothing else really. Overall I enjoyed this film and if you are a fan of harry potter you have already seen this film and if you haven't it is worth a watch but don't set your expectations to high.",7,0,3,24 November 2016
Ocean's Eleven," A Fantastic heist film
","This film has a huge cast full of massive star power and it definitely shows with a fantastic film with a lot of great things going on in it. This film stars Danny Ocean assembling a group of ten other criminals to rob three casinos in Las Vegas for the first time in history. There are so many characters in this film and they are all fantastic from George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts all of them are great and the chemistry that all the characters have is one of the best parts of the film. The story is okay and is a slightly weak point as it is a bit slow in the beginning and it gets pretty convoluted towards the end which is fine for me but for some people it will be difficult to follow. There are some good storytelling aspects but it isn't near perfection. The script is excellent and the dialogue from each character is cool and witty which really enhances the film and carries the film. I really like the look of Las Vegas having been there myself and with this film showcasing Las Vegas the style of this film is another great thing. This film is unique and fantastic and I will always enjoy seeing it.",9,0,1,15 August 2014
Tropic Thunder," Overrated but crazy fun film
","This film has had huge acclaim for it's comedic value but I don't believe it deserves the huge praise it got because it just isn't that funny. This film stars good performances from Robert Downey Jnr, Jack Black and Ben Stiller which helped really carry the majority of this film through the boring parts. The premise of this film is a bunch of actors stuck in a real life warzone and there are some good dialogue exchanges which are funny and carry this film. However, there isn't any moments in this film where you really laugh and nothing happens occasionally where you want either the funny exchanges or the great action. But this film is truly improved by the appearance of Tom Cruise as the businessman in this film he absolutely kills it with his attitude to every situation plus his dance moves are great. With these actors providing really good performances with a good premise but not really as funny as I wanted it is a good film but nowhere near perfection.",6,0,1,18 March 2014
Inside Out," A epic animation that shows pixar still have it
","I have heard rave things about this film and I have finally seen it and wow its pretty brilliant. The premise if the film sees an 11 year old girl made to move to san Francisco. It focuses on the emotions inside her head as they try to keep her life in check. The main emotion is joy played by amy poehler and she is really good. The character is allot of fun and always full of energy, during the film her character really does develop into an interesting character. The rest of the emotions are great as well with sadness, disgust and fear being portrayed very well. But the stand out is definitely anger, he is just so funny and steals the show with how entertaining he is. The story is way deeper then you would expect with the film giving a deep message to children. It also has the fun adventure that children need. The script has allot of great humour that will leave you laughing. But it also has great drama that really makes it a fantastic film. The style is great, with the animation looking really good and allowing the personality of the film to shine. Overall this is a must see for kids and adults alike.",10,5,28,30 March 2016
Die Hard 2," An above average sequel
","After the first film being a huge success and a fantastic film there was allot of pressure on this film to be good and what I will say is that it is better then most modern day action movies even though it is a bit of a let down. Now the premise of the film sees John mclaine at an airport on Christmas eve that gets taken over by terrorists and he is the only one who can stop them. Bruce Willis performance as John mclaine is legendary and this continues in this film, he is really funny and a great action star. He is a deep complex character and he does the action,the humour and the drama really well in this film and he is easily the best part of the film. The villain is alright in this film but doesn't really stand out at all, but this film has every character you need for this film with the arrogant cop, the tech helper and the head of the military And it does a good job of selling you this film. The story is completely ridiculous it just tried to be too big for its own good and the motivations for the villains just are way too convoluted and the twist and turns just don't make any sense. The script is a mixed bag, most of mclaines dialogue was adlibbed but was still fantastic. It was just some of the scenarios were absurd and just took you out of the film. The style of the film was great all the action scenes were really well filmed and another reason this film is enjoyable. I also liked the mix of Christmas and die hard again and once again it works for this film. Overall this film is an alright sequel that if your an action fan you might enjoy.",6,0,1,3 August 2015
Avengers: Endgame," An Epic Cinema Experience
","Over the last few years I have seen quite a few films including all 21 Marvel Cinematic Universe Films so I was unbelieveably excited for Avengers: Endgame and I have to be honest this is my favourite cinema experience of all time. As a casual fan you can enjoy this film but as a person who has been such a huge fan of this universe since the first Iron Man this film is executed absolutley perfectly. This is also the hardest film to review ever as nobody should have this film spoiled for them and the trailers have been incredibly vague but I will give it a go. So the premise of the film is set after the events of Avengers Infinity War and sees the Avengers attempt to fix the destruction that Thanos caused in that film. Now the cast is absolutley huge but I am only going to talk about a few so this review isn't really long, for fans of Chris Evans as Captain America who were disappointed with his role in Infinity War, they will be pleased with his role in this film as he is excellent and at the forefront. Similar to this Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark is obviously fantastic and totally owns the role, Chris Hemsworth as Thor & Scarlet Johansson as Balck Widow are great in their huge roles. But i wanted to talk about some suprisingly great perfromances, this is easily the best Jeremy Renner performance as Hawkeye, he is a damaged character and has way more depth to his performance in this film. Paul Rudd as Ant-Man really works in this ensemble cast, his style of humour really fits well with the other Avengers and was a great balance to the others. Possibly the biggest suprise is Karen Gillan as Nebula who is really fleshed out in this film and I really enjoyed her character arc especially from the first Guardians film to now. For those people that love Josh Brolin as Thanos this film isn't really about him, Infinity War is his film but he is more of a supporting player in this story but he is still great. I can't talk much about the story but it has a perfect mix of drama and humour, also has a great blend of character moments and epic spectacle. That's all I am going to say about the story but it is truly epic. The script is great, with a really good blend with humour and drama you will be laughing one moment and possibly crying the next and that makes this film special. The style just aids in making this film feel truly epic, the action scenes are great and feels different to other Marvel films. Overall this film is going to be remembered as one of the greatest of all time, this expereience has hit me emotionally and I have seen this film twice already and I can see myself watching this film over and over to come for many of years to come.",10,123,232,28 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," a disappointment after casino royale
","This film is the second of Daniel Craig bond films and after how good the first one was my expectations were high for this film but it does disappoint, it isn't bad but it does disappoint for sure. The film sees bond recovering after the events of the last film while being forced to go after a land owner Dominic Greene to stop a plot to destroy a country. Now Daniel Craig is awesome as bond and once again he does a great job in the role combining the action and smoothness that is required for James bond. The bond girl in this film is not very interesting at all and she didn't really add to the film enough except for her looks. The villain Greene is also not menacing at all and he is actually one of the worst bond villains there has been in my opinion. Judi dench returns as m once again and she does a great job and her chemistry with Craig is really good and is one of the best things about the film. Also mathers returns in this film and even though he doesn't have a huge role in the film he does a good job with what he is given. The story is easily the worst part of the film with the stakes being so low and confusing making this a hard narrative to sit through. The script is okay with the exchanges between bond and m being the best but a lot of his phrases are missing and that is a bit disappointing. The style of the film is good, the action is all spot on and I think this darker tone was a good idea. This film though is a failure but it can be fun and it is better then other films like this.",6,0,3,10 October 2014
Independence Day," A great fun destructive film
","With the sequel resurgence coming out I thought I would watch the original independence day and this film is just allot of great fun. The premise of the film sees an alien invasion that forces the whole world to unite to stop them. Jeff goldblum is a brilliant actor and he is really good in this film. I found hid character pretty interesting and I found him really entertaining throughout the film. Will Smith was an unknown at this point but he just oozes charisma in this film. I also liked his character and how he and goldblum interacted. Bill Pullman plays the president of the United states and he is possibly the coolest president in film history. He has a pretty emotional journey throughout this film and I really cared about him. I thought the two love interests were good as well as they worked and I bought there romance with smith and goldblum. The story has some decent character moments and depth to its characters. Unfortunately, the film is a little simple and it comes across with a few plot holes and clichés that don't help the decent run time. The script has some decent drama and humour in it but it just has quite a bit of ridiculous cheese in it. The style is great especially considering that this film is 20 years old I thought all the action scenes and special effects were great. Overall I really enjoyed this film and I hope the sequel is just as good.",8,0,0,23 June 2016
District 9," a fantastic film that questions conventions
","Going into watching this film I had heard very little about it and I knew very little so it was to my delight that this film is utterly fantastic. The story sees aliens arrive to earth in the 1980s above Johannesburg in south Africa, these aliens called prawns are put into poverty and this particular place is called district 9. Now this film is about the prawns in a lot of ways but also there had to be a representation of humanity and our lead does a really good job in this. Played by debutant sharlto Copley our lead character really represents the upper class and he does a great job of turning his character in ways that aren't expected and making him feel relatable to the prawns and I thought he did a great job doing that. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag though with the two prawns he allies with being great and feeling almost human in the way they react in their own ways as their relationship with the human grows. But the problem with the other human characters is that nobody stands out with a great performance as they are just all completely average, but that is not a huge bad thing because of Copley's performance. The story is excellent with this first time director really putting a lot of social messages into this film with the representations of characters. I also like how these are not your typical aliens and they fit into this realistic story and world. The script is great with a lot of heartfelt moments in this film even from the prawns and when a film can make aliens relatable that is a job well done. The style is freaking awesome with the cockroach look of the prawns really looking great and modern, also the weaponry is insane with all the guns being massive. Another great thing is that this film takes place in south Africa and because of this less then typical setting it adds a lot to the film. Overall this is a film I recommend to anybody as it is a fantastic film and I hope this director does eventually get the chance to make the halo movie that was planned.",9,1,1,12 October 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," An improvement on the first film and a fantastic film in the LoTR franchise
","I know the first Hobbit film has its criticisms but I did really enjoy it and think it was great but this film improves on that film and is even better. This film picks up where the last one with Thoran, Bilbo and the rest of the dwarfs getting closer to Erebor and the dragon Smaug's lair while Gandalf has to go on his own quest to deal with a new threat involving the Necromancer. First of all the main characters, Martin Freeman as Bilbo is a superb choice and his performance in this one is better than the last as you can see how events in the last movie have affected him and changed the character for this film. The rest of the characters are great too Thoran Oakenshield feels much more driven in this film and more of an awesome leader then he was in the first film. Once again Ian Mckellen is superb as Gandalf the grey even though I have some problems with what they do with him but he was great. The additions of Evangeline Lilly's character and Legolas were great and the action they introduced was a great change to just the dwarfs and added a new dimension to the film. But the show stealer 100 percent is the dragon Smaug. The use of CGI and the look of him is superb and Benedict Cumberbatch's voice to it is eary, evil and superb. If you don't like anything in this film you will love Smaug. Now a problem I have with this film is it's story, for the majority of this film the story is mostly the same as the first film. Also there is the second plot with Gandalf that is pretty interesting but it gets less screen time then it deserves and we do not see Gandalf's journey enough to be interested. But the pay off to the journey is massive and throughout there is some decent storytelling. The script is really good with all the delivery of lines great and the way the interactions happen are very interesting. The style is obviously superb with the middle earth history being superb especially with the addition of Smaug. This is not as good as any of the original trilogy but It is fantastic and definitely worth seeing.",9,2,5,29 August 2014
Batman Begins," a fantastic film that saved batman
","After the messes that were batman forever and batman and robin this film has literally saved batman and finally giving us the film that this new era of batman fans deserve. Thus film sees Bruce Wayne attempting to get justice for the death of his parents by fighting criminals, under the guidance of his mentor ducard he returns to Gotham city and becomes the batman. Now I really do believe that Christian bale is the best batman we have ever had because he was great as the phoney carefree billionaire that Bruce Wayne is but was also great at being the intense batman that strikes fear into criminals. The supporting cast is also top quality, Michael caine was the perfect casting as Alfred as he brought a sense of loyalty and parenthood to the film but also provided well done comedy as well in this dark film. Liam neeson is one of my favourite actors and this film is no different as he is fantastic as ducard really providing great chemistry with bale. One of the worst things about the old batman films was the character of Jim Gordon but oh no not in this film, Gary oldman does a fantastic job in the role and proves he can do good guys. Katie Holmes as Rachael was good and I think she had good chemistry with bale in this film but she isn't as impressive as the rest of the cast. Now the story is great, I love seeing Bruce Wayne's training and the reasons given to him for becoming batman, also there is a big swerve taken in this film towards the end and it is truly fantastically done adding to the overall spectacle. The script was good but sometimes some of the dialogue didn't hit me like it was supposed too and I really think that is the only criticism I have for the whole film. The style is the best in batman history with all the cool gadgets and the more ninja based batman it provided better action and also the cinematography is off the scale for this film deserving its Oscar nomination. Overall this is an utterly fantastic film and I thank Christopher Nolan for saving batman.",9,1,2,17 October 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A great film worthy of the middle earth name.
","I rewatched this film last night and since I didn't really do a proper review for it before I thought I would now. The premise of this film sees hobbit Bilbo baggins thrust into an adventure on a question with a wizard and 12 dwarfs to reclaim there homeland from a dragon. Martin freeman as young Bilbo was a perfect choice, he totally encapsulated everything I imagined him to be. He was funny and likable and you really wanted to root for him on his adventure. Ian mckellen returns to his iconic role of gandalf the grey and well he is fantastic in this film. He is gandalf and always will be he totally encapsulates the wise older wizard who we all want to listen too. Richard arimtage plays thorin oakenshield who is the leader of the dwarfs and he was really good in this film. Yes he was a bit grumpy and stubborn sometimes but you see the pain in his character and you understand why he must complete this task. I also really like how his and Bilbo's relationship develops as the film goes on. However, one of my biggest negatives was the rest of the group of dwarfs. Even in a 2 and a half hour movie we don't really get any development for them and it actually makes me not really care about them too much. The story had a really good vibe about it, I love some of the character development and some great cameos that actually made sense. However, this film does have the problem that it really does lack in payoff. The ending was pretty lacklustre which is probably down to them having to make it three movies. The script was great with allot of well placed humour but some great drama that really stressed the situation. The style if this film is breathtaking with the look of the film being beautiful and all the action scenes really delivering. Overall this is a great movie that if your a middle earth fan you must see.",8,1,5,18 October 2015
Non-Stop," an average suspense film
","In anticipation for Liam neesons new action film run all night so I watched his action film from last year non-stop and I must say I am a bit disappointed because it is completely average. The premise of this film sees a US Marshall who is on a flight that is being hijacked and every 20 minutes someone will die unless the hijacker gets 150 million dollars. Now Liam neeson is always great in these roles and this one is no different as he completely commits to the role and makes this film somewhat enjoyable. There is allot of characters in this film and Julianne Moore is good in the film and she is the the most interesting character apart from neeson. Even though there are some other decent performances there characters are not expanded enough to make you care about them. When you look at the story you start to realise just how ridiculous it is, when the deaths happen they are ridiculously convoluted and crazy that you just can't buy it. Also when the reasoning behind the hijackers motivation is revealed it feels underwhelming and doesn't resonate with you. The script has some good dramatic and humorous dialogue but some of it feels cliché and doesn't help make these characters interesting. The style is alright with the film not being a complete action film but having allot of suspense to carry the film and that was interesting. But when the action scenes happened it was a little hard to see what was going on and what was happening. Overall this is not a bad film but it isn't memorable and is totally average.",5,0,0,19 March 2015
Saving Private Ryan," a disturbingly real film that can be hard to watch for some people
","This film is lauded as one of the greatest films of all time and I do believe this film is fantastic, but I believe that it is not a ten out of ten film for a few reasons that I will explain. This film is based in ww2 and the start of the film is the invasion of Normandy better known as d-day. After the battle a group of 8 soldiers are sent on an important mission to rescue a private who's other brothers have been killed recently. Now tom thanks is now established as one of the best actors ever and it is films like this that is why. His performance as the commander felt real it felt like he knew his duty but he was relatable to us because of the way he acted in certain situations. This man is a superstar and he truly encapsulates everything that this commander has to go through. The supporting cast all also do a really good job, this film is not a character study film but everything the characters go through make you feel for them and empathise with the characters. Now the story is where I actually think this film slightly misses, I do believe it plays up the war part of the story well and also the social issues that are explored should be applauded and are very good. However, towards the middle of this film it just felt like 30-40 mins could have been cut out because nothing relevant to the story happens and it could have been done in a better way. The script is really good with the dialogue feeling natural among war buddies and it also makes you feel like you are in battle with them. The style is great I applaud Spielberg for making this film more realistic with the brutality because that was how war really was. A lot of directors try to pc it but not a top director and it adds to the realistic gritty feeling that this film possesses. This is a heavy film and it can be hard to watch sometimes but it is a fantastic film that truly delivers on its message and does indeed deserve a lot of praise.",9,2,3,15 October 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," a fantastic film that did come as a surprise.
",I had heard great things about the grand Budapest hotel so I decided to watch it and I must say it is a fantastic surprise. The premise sees a hotel concierge being accused of murder and he goes on the run with his bell boy who he becomes good friends with. Now I can't believe more people aren't talking about Ralph Fiennes performance in this film as it is fantastic. He mixes the comedic moments and the drama well and his chemistry with zero really carries the film. The supporting cast is really good with the kid who plays zero really shining and I would expect to see more of him in the future. Jeff goblem is really good in the film and its always good to see him in a film. Edward Norton is great as the army commander and his dialogue is pretty funny.Willem Dafoe and Darien Brody are great as the villains and are funny in their roles. The story is okay and I really enjoyed Fiennes and zeros story but I felt the storytelling part of the film was quite unnecessary and I may have given this film a perfect score if it had just been a self contained story. The script is fantastic with the dialogue being fantastic and allowing really being memorable and making all the characters interesting. At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the style but it does look breathtaking and the hotel looks beautiful which is a big part of the film. Overall this is a fantastic film that will come as a big surprise i would expect.,9,1,3,5 January 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," a fantastic film that really did surprise me
","I really did like mi 3 and thought it was the best of the franchise, however, I was worried that any future films wouldn't be as good but boy was I surprised as this is even better and easily the best of the franchise. The film sees the IMF blamed for the bombing of the Kremlin which sees agent Ethan hunt and the rest of his team trying to stop a nuclear war. Now tom cruise is back as Ethan hunt and I think he does a fantastic job in the role with this performance being a bit more funny then the others but also keeping up with the action he is so good at. The rest of the team are also really good, jeremy Renner is in the film as an analyst and he us fantastic with some really good humour but also his character had more layers to him then what I expected. The female member of the team Jane was really good too and probably the best woman in the franchise. Simon pegg returns to his role and he is really good, his comedic timing is really good and helps give a slightly lighter tone, I really liked all these characters because they were all important unlike some previous team members. The only character that was a bit of a throwaway was that of the villain I mean he is okay but his performance is nowhere near as good as Philip Seymour Hoffman in the previous film. The story has never been the strongest point of these films and that theme continues here with the overall plot not being very strong at all. But as I said I really liked the story of the team and how each of them had a special plot piece. This is probably the best mi script with the dialogue being fresh and funny, also the chemistry between the characters is really good. The style is fantastic especially the Dubai tower as the effects wow and help sell the epicness of the film. Overall this is a fantastic action film that should be seen.",9,1,4,27 November 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," An Average Sequel that fails to capture the magic of the first film.
","After the amazing Jurassic Park a sequel was inevitable and in 1997 this film Jurassic Park: The Lost World was released and it is a pretty disappointing film to watch to be honest. The premise of the film sees a small team travel to a twin island of the island from the first film to see what dinosaurs are alive. Going from supporting character to the lead is Jeff Goldblum as Dr Ian Malcolm and of course he is great in this film. It helps that I love him as an actor but Malcolm is the only character actually talking sense in this film and that you end up caring about. The supporting cast is completely different in this film, I actually liked Vince Vaughan in his role in the film, he had that snarky demeanour about him that we have grown to know but he gave a bit of depth to the role as well. I also really liked Pete Postlethwaite in this film, he plays a ruthless hunter in the film and I totally bought him in this role and thought he did a really goof job. However, Julianne Moore plays Goldblum's girlfriend in this film and I found her really annoying. Her character comes across as being overly arrogant and I didn't buy her and Goldblum's chemistry at all. Also I didn't care about the whole daughter character and felt it was shoehorned in to try and add some heart to the film that just isn't there. The story for me was the weakest part of the film, I felt like the whole plot just feels like an excuse to get these characters back on an island without much real interesting motivations. Also the last act of the film feels like a different film and doesn't fit very well with the overall plot of the film. The script has some decent humour in it especially from Goldblum, even though I don't feel like it worked as much as the first film. The drama doesn't hit anywhere near as much as the previous film and I think that is why I didn't really care about this film. The style of the film still has some decent CGI Dinosaurs in it even though again it doesn't feel as marvellous as the first film. Also I feel like the pacing is a bit of an issue as this film feels about 20 minutes too long for sure. Overall this is a step down from the original film and its not that bad but is just a bit uninspiring and not memorable.",6,141,234,22 May 2018
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," An absolutely fantastic reboot/prequel
",I never thought I would see the day that a CGI ape could be argued to being one of the best performances in recent memory and it is truly justified. This film was marketed as James Franco in the lead with Caesar being a slightly lesser character but this is Caesar's film and Andy Serkis is absolutely fantastic in this role which is incredible. I felt for this ape more then most human characters in any film and it truly provided lots of emotion to this character. Franco's character is also really good and his chemistry is great with Caesar which truly builds the foundations of this film. Franco's father in the film is a good character as well as he bridged the gap between Franco and Caesar and the combination of the two roles. Franco's girlfriend and the villains weren't really expanded and aren't a real strength of the film which is the only reason it doesn't get a ten out of ten. The story is a great Caesar origin story and it provides a real twist in the film that makes you feel even more sympathetic for this character. The script is one of the best around and the lack of dialogue by Caesar is the key to why he is such a fascinating character and why he carries this film. The style is fantastic as well with the way the apes moved and the way they interacted all culminating in the great last half of the film. This film is fantastic and a great start to these new apes films.,9,1,4,21 July 2014
Legend," A fantastic film with an amazing performance
","The trailer for this film had me so excited for this film and I can report that this film does not disappoint because it is fantastic. The premise of this film sees two identical brothers who are the biggest gangsters in London and sees there rise to power. Now tom hardy plays Reggie and ron kray and my goodness this is the best acting I have seen because of how unique it is and how different the two characters are. First to the lead Reggie, he is the charming one of the two and you truly see that as the film grows and he is complex but flawed at the same time. He had allot of confidence and swagger but you see sometimes how low his confidence can get. Then you get to ron and he is one of the funniest characters of the year. You can tell there just isn't something right with him but he is lovable and you end up liking his character. Emily browning plays Reggie's wife and she does a great job in this film. She truly brings out the humanity in both of the krays and she was a great cog in this film. Taron Edgerton was good in this film even though he didn't have a huge role I'm looking forward to seeing him in more things in the future. The story is fantastic just seeing these two completely different brothers interact and rise in power is enthralling. Also the romance was great in the film really adding a great emotional level to the film. The script is utterly amazing, the humour is constant and it always works. The drama was all fantastic too and brings the best out of the story and characters. The style of the action scenes were fantastic and really were great when they happened. However, there is a bit of a pacing issue in the film and it does hurt the film overall. Overall this is a fantastic dramatic film with two performances worthy of an Oscar by tom hardy and is a must see.",9,5,18,9 September 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," An Epic Superhero film 10 Years in the making.
","Avengers Infinity war is finally here, this has been my most anticipated film for a long time now and even though it is hard to believe this film lives up to all the hype and delivers a truly amazing film. The premise of the film sees the Mad Titan Thanos on the hunt for the six Infinity stones, standing in his way are the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. This film has tons of characters but in my opinion the main and most important character in this film is Josh Brolin's Thanos. This character could have been a weakness to this film but it turns out he is the most interesting part of this film, his character is menacing and bought to life amazingly through great CGI. He also has so much depth to his character and a detailed motivation for his actions that made this overall story much more interesting. Robert Downey Jnr is back as Tony Stark/Iron Man and he is so natural in this role that he could probably play it in his sleep. He adds his usual fun to the film but also some really important character moments that helped this performance. Another important character in this film is Thor played by Chris Hemsworth, after the success of Thor Ragnarok, Hemsworth continues to excel in this role and I found his part in this film to be interesting and fun to watch. Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland recently had there solo movies as Dr Strange and Spider-man and they both did a great job in this film. They add depth to their roles in this film especially Cumberbatch that helps build interest in his character when interacting with Downey and Holland. The rest of the Avengers and Guardians cast all do great jobs in their roles even though due to the large amount of characters in this film certain individuals may not get the screen time that audience members would like. The story in this film was something I was worried about due to the huge cast, but this film delivered. All the different story arcs were worked really well and gave something different to the overall story, also as mentioned previously the villains story is treated really well and gives this villain more depth then expected. This film also promised to raise the stakes and they do this in an appropriate but natural way that will keep the audience interested. The script has the usual Marvel humour in it, but the most important part of the script was the added drama and depth added to the characters really raised the bar for this film that they delivered on. The style in this film is huge and epic, the balance of story arcs are treated well and allowed the majority of characters to feel relevant. The action scenes in this film felt huge in scale and unique depending on the characters involved with helped really make this film unique. Overall this is truly the epic Marvel blockbuster promised and needs to be seen at the cinema to be truly appreciated, just make sure you are caught up on these films and go see this film as soon as possible.",10,7,12,26 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Great Tribute To Old School Hollywood
","This is the long anticipated 9th film by the great Quentin Tarantino so this became a must watch to me and I really enjoyed this film even though I do think this is possibly the weakest Tarantino film that has been made. The premise of the film is set in the 1960's and sees an ageing actor and ageing stuntman go through the world of Hollywood and reignite their careers. Leonard Di Caprio hasn't been in a film for 4 years and he is back here and I tell you he has not missed a beat, he is absolutley amazing in this film. He is mesmarizing on screen and he is just a lot of fun to watch and shows new actors how to be a movie star. Brad Pitt plays his bestfriend and stuntman in the film and he is so cool in this film, their chemistry together is amazing to see especially when they are two of the best actors around and they truly show it on screen together. Their are a lot of fun cameos in the movie from actors who have been in previous Tarantino films which was unexpected and nice to see. Now I love Margot Robbie, she is a great actress but I thought her character was incredibly pointless and it felt like she was just shoehorned into this film so Tarantino could say that he had a female lead in this film. I would describe the story as an enjoyable mess, there are great moments and scenes but as a coherent story there isn't really much going on here, like 2 hours in I still wasn't sure what was the point in the film but the last 30 minutes are amazing and definitley saved the film for me. The script is great, the dialogue is typically Tarantino being quick and funny just like he is very good at and it takes this film and raises it another level. The style is a true homage to old Hollywood and it is interesting to see, however, this film really strides into gear when it goes full Tarantino and embraces theri directors vision. Overall I really enjoyed Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and if you are a fan of Tarantino you have to see this film.",8,14,31,29 August 2019
Beasts of No Nation," A great war film that hits its message
",This is Netflix first feature film and idris Elba is in it so I was interested and I really liked this film. This film focuses on a child who gets rescued by a military commandant who forces him to become a child soldier. Now the kid in this movie is really good and I wouldn't be surprised if we see him popping up in more things after this film. I bought him as this child soldier that was forced to do these horrible acts as his innocenece is becoming more and more lost. Obviously the biggest and best actor in this film is obviously idris Elba as the commandant and he is fantastic in this film. He was great as the commandant and even though he is an evil character you can see why these kids would believe in him because he is very charismatic. A problem with this film is that their are parts of the film where it trys to make you care about other characters and you really don't. The story is great as you see this boy and his life develop in the hands of this terrible situation. Also the end if this film really delivers in my opinion. The script has some pretty good dramatic dialogue but sometimes it was hard to understand some of the dialogue which was a negative. The style was pretty brutal and it was very good in my opinion with a great blend of story and action which really worked. Overall this film was a big surprise to me and I thought it was great.,8,2,4,21 October 2015
Gone Girl," A fantastic thriller that always interests you
","I have been really looking forward to seeing gone girl and I finally have and I must say that this is a fantastic film. The premise of this film sees a husband come home one day to find his wife missing and as the evidence piles up the question becomes did nick dunne kill his wife?. Ben affleck is one of the best directors in Hollywood today there is no doubt, but his acting sometimes gets overlooked because he was fantastic in this film. You see this damaged figure who is clearly upset about his situation but it makes you curious about him. He really is a complex character in this film and makes me even more excited to see him as batman. Now every performance in this film is great but this is truly the Rosamund pike show and is the best thing she has ever done. She was superb in this movie because you really got to see her character develop and learn stuff about her. She wasn't your simple damsel she has a real edge about her that I loved. Tyler Perry's plays afflecks lawyer and this is the best thing I've ever seen him in too. He was funny and likable but also a serious character that you liked. Neil Patrick Harris is good in this movie because he plays a really different role in this film then usual. He was nice when he needed to be and creepy when he needed to be. I also liked the character of afflecks sister who added allot to the film as well. I loved the mystery element to the story as you follow the investigation with the characters and the twists and turns that follow it. However, there is a twist about half way through the movie that took away allot of the tension for me and also I thought the ending was a little weak. The script was fantastic with the characters all having real serious moments blended with really good humour to make them feel like real people. The style of the film is great, it looks beautiful and the tone really works. I also loved the use of flashbacks to expand on the story in this film. Overall gone girl is a fantastic movie that if you like these types of films it is a must see.",9,3,5,8 September 2015
Django Unchained," Awesome Western adventure
","This western is another fantastic addition to the collection of Tarantino films that are just pure awesome. This film has just a bit of everything going for it, it has comedy, gore, action and just overall a great western experience. The performances of Jamie Foxx, Samuel L Jackson, Christoph Waltz and Leonardo Di Caprio really make this film the spectacle it is with each of them providing contrasts to the situation that each are put in and there is some horrific scenes in this film. This narrative really hits the viewer on each responses of emotional, intellectual and visceral with most of the dialogue totally shocking for this day and age that we watch the film. The interactions between the protagonists Foxx and Waltz is the most entertaining part of this film as they go on the journey looking for redemption, vengeance and revenge. This film hits the audience in all different ways and without a small part of lull in the middle this film is interesting throughout and has huge action and violence to keep you interested. So see this film no matter what it is just completely fantastic throughout.",9,0,3,26 February 2014
Get Out," A great film with a lot of important social commentary
","This has been the one film that has come out this year that I missed in the cinema but I have now see get out and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of the film sees a young black man go and meet his white girlfriend's family, he seems to notice that something weird might be going on. Daniel kaluuya is a new actor to me and he plays the lead in this film and he is fantastic in this film. You are rooting for his character so much throughout this film as you are really watching this film through his eyes. He is very likable in the film that makes him a great character. Allison Williams is his girlfriend in this film and she is good in this film, they have very good chemistry together and you are behind there relationship succeeding. Lilrel Howery plays his friend in this film and he is hilarious in this film, his dialogue is great throughout the whole film and is really funny in the film. The entire cast does a great job with the roles they are given and all the characters are interesting to watch. The story is pretty fascinating as you see this guy try and get used to his new surroundings while trying to work out was is actually wrong. However, even though entertaining I felt the end of this film to be a bit rushed and I could have done with an extra 15 or 20 minutes of details. The script is great, the blend of humour and drama is really well handled and makes this more unique then expected. The style of the film has so much great tension that truly sucks you in to follow and try and work out what is going on. But I wasn't a huge fan of some of the more trippy off the walls scenes that took me out of the serious nature of this film. Overall this is a great film with so much great social commentary and should definitely be seen.",8,10,19,28 July 2017
Aladdin," A good fun recreation of a classic
","Disney has started recently of remaking their animated classics into live action films and the newest one of these is Aladdin. The premise of the film sees a kind hearted street kid attempt to win the affections of a proncess with the help of a magical genie. Mena Massoud plays Aladdin in this film and honestly I have never seen him in anything before, he was okay in this film, he sold the nervy awkward guy well and fit the role well. owever, I just felt like he was a bit dull and bland which made it difficult for me to really care about his character. Lets just get to the biggest part in this film, Will Smith as the genie, he really is the life of the film. I know Robin Williams is iconic as the genie but Smith does a great job giving his own version of the character, he is so charismatic and charming really owning the screen. Kristen Scott plays Jasmine in the film and she does a good job in the role, she is a strong character and fits the chsaracter very well and gives young girls somebody to root for. Though we come to Marwan Kenzari's performance as Jafar which is just so generic. he is a boring villain and isn't menacing at all. He doesn't seem like an imposing threat and really weakened the film for me. Also none of the other characters are given enough to work with to make anybody care about their characters. The story is good, its a classic tale and honestly not much is changed from the classic animated film. Though this is an issue like all of these live action remakes is that they are very predictable and it does hurt the overall experience of the film. The script is great, the drama and humour is used very well especially for the family audience that this film is clearly geared for. The style is also fanatastic, all the colours used are so vibrant and really gives this film life. The CGI is top notch and makes this film feel like a large scale film. Overall this is a good film that plenty of kids will grow up watching and that is not a problem.",7,3,10,26 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," A great film that documents an incredible life
","I went to see the theory of everything not thinking it was going to my cup of tea but I actually ended up loving it. This is the life story of professor Stephen hawking and his relationship with his wife and his debilitating disease. Now one of the biggest compliments I believe you can give an actor in a film like this is when you forget who is acting and you see the person in front of you and Eddie Redmanyne did this superbly. His performance was fantastic as he not only had to play this iconic person but because of the disease his performance had to be adapted and change throughout and that was so enthralling to watch and he is definitely worth his Oscar win. Felicity Jones plays his wife Jane and she is also fantastic, their chemistry is really what carries the film and make it easy to watch and without that this film wouldn't be worth it at all. She deserves her Oscar nomination for her role that has launched her career. Credit to Charlie Cox as well who even though his role is small he does a great job with it. To be honest this is a simple love story but it mixes with hawkings disability to make it an emotional roller-coaster. However, I really wanted to know more about hawkings work and his relationship with his studies but you get hardly any of that in favour of the romance aspect. These script was a massive surprise because of just how much comedy and humour there was that really helped the film flow. The style of the film was a bit of a mixed bag as the film is shot beautifully but there was some stylistic choices that I thought were a little too much and took me out of the film. Overall I really enjoyed this film and I would advise you to see it.",8,1,1,26 February 2015
X-Men: The Last Stand," The worst of the original X Men trilogy by far
","Whoever thought it was a good idea to continue this film without Bryan Singer is a complete idiot as this film is a large step down from the others which is so disappointing. This film picks up just after X2 with the X-Men attempting to recover from the events of the previous better film, while Magneto is creating a huge army of mutants to destroy the humans. This film is just not very good, it isn't horrible but it just isn't good in my opinion for several reason. For one a problem with all the X-Men films but most of all this one is the continuity of these films unlike Disney's Marvel films plot points in this film contradicts the previous films but also future X-men films. Also even though this film is meant to be more epic then the previous films with higher stakes how come it is shorter then X2? it should have been at least 15-30 mins longer to possibly attempt to save this film. There is more as well as one thing that angered me was taking out two huge fan favourite characters in the first 20 mins in this film which was another thing that angered me. However, there is some positives with great performances once again from the usual group of Magneto, Professor X, Storm, Jean Grey and Storm but a few of the new characters introduced I really liked with Beast and Juggernaut being great in my opinion. Also there are some great effects in this film that are a great positive. But I am sorry this film is not good enough for all these reasons and I must emphasise how happy I am now Bryan Singer is back.",4,0,1,2 April 2014
Good Will Hunting," A fantastic dramatic film.
","After recently seeing one if matt damons best performances in the Martian it made me really want to see this film. The premise of this film sees this incredibly smart janitor at MIT who goes to therapist to try and fulfill his potential. This was one of matt Damon's first lead performances and he is brilliant in this film. He was a great character that you want to root for even though he clearly has his issues. He was an incredibly interesting character that is one of Damon's best. The best performance in this film is that of the late robin Williams. He was such a great character as you see him and Damon interact in these sessions and it is some of the best chemistry I have ever seen in a film with some very memorable lines. Ben affleck really works as Damon's best friend and I really liked their chemistry in this film. Winona Ryder is great as Damon's girlfriend and their relationship really worked in this film. Stellan skarssgard is the professor trying to get the best out of Damon and I thought he was a very interesting character in this film that provided an opposite to Williams. The story was really good especially with Damon and all the relationships he encounters in the film especially Williams. It is fascinating seeing the mentality of will as he goes through this journey in the film. The script is great with some truly funny dialogue and some great drama. The style of the dismal setting works for this film. However, the only problem with this film is that of the pacing of the film as it can drag a little bit. Overall though this is a fantastic film that deserves all its praise.",9,1,4,27 October 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A real average film that will disappoint many
","This film was one of the most anticipated films of 2013 but I never got around to seeing it, but now I have seen this film I am glad I didn't waste my money going to the cinema to see this film. This film sees an average guy Walter who is as average as you like, with his and a colleague's job on the line he must step out of his comfort zone to attempt to save his job. Now Ben Stiller is a mixed bag with me but mostly I do like him, and I do like him in this film. He is nothing special in this film but he does a decent job in the lead, he does prove that some actors just cannot direct films he is in. The supporting cast is okay as well with Kristen Wiig delivering a good performance, but I am not sure if her and Stiller's chemistry not always being there. Also I thought that Adam Scott did a good job with what he was given but I did find him funny when he was on screen. Some of the other supporting characters aren't really utilised such as his mother and sister who could have added a lot to the film but were misused. The story is not great especially with the romance that just seemed immature and ridiculous, also the first half of this film is just so dull and bad. The end of this film was really good though and the last 20 mins had the right amount of heart in it to work. The script is okay with some of the dialogue being great between some of the characters but not all of it hits the audience where it should. The style of the film is okay as well with it shot well and the foreign scenes being impressive, however, some of the artistic ideas were stupid and really failed throughout the film. Overall this is an average film that is a big disappointment.",5,1,1,30 October 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The second is just as good as the first
","The word epic doesn't really do justice to what the Lord Of The The Rings are but it is as close as you are going to get to perfection in film and The Two Towers are no different. The story sees The Fellowship broken and Frodo and Sam are still heading to Mordor this time with the help of the creature Gollum. While Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli searching for Merry and Pippin who are still in the possession of the Urk-Hai. The acting in the film once again is superb with Elijah Wood doing a great job as the ring becomes more of a burden to him as the film progresses and adds to the film. Viggo Mortensen really shines in this film as Aragorn as he becomes more of a leader and his character really truly shines. Ian Mckellen returns as Gandalf and for the scenes that he is in he shines as the mentor he is. Also the rest of the assembled cast were great with Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies chemistry really shining. But a huge mention has to go to Andy Serkis as Gollum who with his motion capture performance really changed the world of film as we know it and I think was robbed of a supporting actor Oscar nomination. There are 3 stories in the film and for the most part the Aragorn and Frodo stories are great with Merry and Pippins story dull but by the end it feels great also. So overall the stories in this film are top notch and really raise the level of stakes in the film. The script is great with a great variety or heart and comedy and the dialogue is fantastic between everybody and it looked like they were all having fun. The style of the film is breathtaking and just like the story raises the stakes especially with the Helms Deep battle that is utterly great. Overall this is one of the best sequels ever made and I absolutely love it.",10,2,3,9 March 2014
The Lion King," A Fantastic recreation of an amazing original film
","We are in the age of remakes of animated classics and it is the turn of The Lion King and I thought this was a fantastic representation of a classic film, it is not a replacement for the original film but a brilliant film to go alongside it. The premise of the film sees new heir to the throne of the Animal Kingdom Simba have to grow up and overcome the troubles of his nefarious uncle Scar. We see two versions of Simba and both are great, the child version of Simba really does a great job at being innocent and delivering a heartfelt performance. Donald Glover playing the adult version also really worked and he nailed the character and really provided a great voice acting performance. In my opinion a real highlight of this film is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, he has such a presence about the role in this film. Scar is a great character and Ejiofor really bought all the complexity of the character out and made him a very memorable villain. Another big highlight of the film is the fantastic chemistry between Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen as Timon & Pumbaa, they are so funny in the film and provide a great counter in this film from some of the draker moments in the film. Alfre Woodard, Beyonce, John Oliver & James Earl Jones all do great jobs and emphasise why this is one of the best casts assembled for any movie. The story is goof, delivering the mix of drama and humour that would be expected in this film, however, like the majority of these Disney rermakes the film is quite formulaic and it is noticeable in this film that it is very similar to the original film. The script is great, this film for me does a really good job, it does a great job of blending a fun film with great dramatic moments in it. The style is amazing in this film, visually it looks stunning with some of the best CGI that you are gonna see in any film around, plus the use of colour is really important in this film and the story of the film. All the songs are back from the original and they are sung excellently by the cast. Overall I am a fan of thise remakes from Disney and The Lion King is a fantastic family film that should be seen by all members of the family.",9,4,9,24 July 2019
Stardust," A fantastic fantasy film that is a real surprise
","This film is definitely one of the most underrated films of all time as this is a fantastic film and this is truly one of the greatest fantasy films I can think of. With the big name actors and actresses in this film it is a surprise to see Charlie Cox in the lead as Tristan and I must say he does a great job. He starts as an annoying brat but as you would expect he grows and his character becomes a heroic one who even becomes likable towards the end of the film as he makes the correct decision. The supporting characters are also fantastic throughout. Claire Danes as the star was a great choice and she is similar to Tristan as she starts off annoying but grows on you as the film progresses. The chemistry is good between the two and the relationship is good and believable. Mark Strong in Hollywood could be seen as one of the best bad guys around and he lives up to this as Prince Septimus. He is so evil and truly great in this villainous role, just like Michelle Pfeifer who thrives as the witch villain and she also thrives in this role and looks like she enjoys it. The biggest surprise was Robert De Niro's character as he really is different to what I expected but he is great and he is truly a class actor. The story from the outside could have been seen as over the top and cookie cutter but it does its job really well with the number of people on the chase for the star being right and the relationship/hero story is done very well. The script is decent with a good blend between drama and humour but sometimes some of the dialogue feels a little off on occasion. The style is so cool though with the mix of fantasy such as witches and pirates really creates a great blend and a new backdrop for a superb film.",9,5,6,12 August 2014
I Am Legend," a good survival film with an awesome lead performance
","I just got this film on blu Ray so I decided to watch it and I must say that this is a decent survivor film with some positive things about it. The premise of this film sees one survivor of a disease living in New York city trying to find a cure while trying to survive the zombies and the craziness of the situation. Now I am a pretty big fan of will Smith but I think this is one of the best performances I have ever seen from him and possibly Oscar worthy. Honestly what I liked was that for the majority of the film he didn't play the character that he is known for but he was clearly a damaged guy and you felt for him as his life has been taken away from him. He delivers a really powerful performance that really shows in a certain dramatic scene that really has you feeling sympathetic for him and sad yourself. Now this is a one man show but there are a couple of support in characters that turn up in the film but they really aren't important and you know nothing about them and won't care one bit. The story is good, I mean along with those heartwrenching scenes you really feel like this is a realistic take on how New York would look like if it had been deserted and you see him trying to live a life and it makes you feel empathetic for his character. However, the film takes a twist in its tone and it ends up feeling a bit like a simplistic horror movie that didn't have anything unique about it which is a shame. The script has some great moments, the drama is done superbly and it really is at its best when it sticks to the tone of loneliness and emptiness. But like the story when it tries to be a bit more funny and have a bit more cliché writing it takes away from the films overall grit. The style of the film is great, as I mentioned before I really liked the look of new York in a post apocalyptic environment. All the action scenes were done well down to good cinematography and the zombies looked really cool which is a positive. Overall this is a good film but it does have some flaws that need to be addressed.",7,1,2,18 July 2015
The Bourne Legacy," Not the Legacy Bourne deserved
","I have recently seen the Bourne trilogy and loved all three of them so my excitement for this 4th instalment was high going in to watch it. However, this wasn't the film I wanted or expected, I believe having the franchise name of Bourne attached to this film really hurt me even more when it was kind of a mess. This film is based at a similar time of The Bourne ultimatum with a new agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) in his own situation with the CIA. The main problem with this film is that for a Bourne film this is a surprisingly boring film for at least the first hour with little happening. This character of Aaron Cross is just not as likable or interesting as Matt Damon's iconic character Jason Bourne and this hurts the film as Jason Bourne is mentioned throughout. I must say that Jeremy Renner's performance is good but as I said before he just isn't Jason Bourne and one of my favourite parts of this film is seeing the characters from the previous films and how it links with this film. Also the end action sequence is the one part where this film feels like Bourne and is one of the times I thought it was awesome. This along with the tense fighting scenes are the strength of this film whereas the narrative isn't to the par of the other Bourne's or other films. I hope that there is a 5th Bourne film with the original Director and Matt Damon coming back as Jason Bourne, if this isn't going to happen then this should be the end of Bourne for now until it eventually gets fully rebooted.",5,2,4,6 March 2014
22 Jump Street," a really funny bromance comedy
","Now for starters I have not seen the 21 jump street with the same cast but that does not matter for this film to be funny. I went into this film with a fresh look and hoping for something funny which is what I got. This film sees Jonah hills character and channing Tatum's character reunited to go infiltrate college and take down a drug dealing cartel. Now before this film I was not impressed with Tatum in anything but he is fantastic in this film and I really believe comedy should be where he stays for now. Jonah hill is an established comedic actor and he is also fantastic and the chemistry between the two is just electric and one of the best combinations I have seen. Another great character is ice cube and he was hilarious throughout and actually my favourite scene in this film is one where he flips out. Jonah hills girlfriend, channing Tatums football buddy and the villain are all solid and funny at times as well. the story is alright I liked how it depicted American college and how the film has a lot of heart to it. However, it even points out that the plot is similar to the first and this does bring the story down a bit. The script is pretty good with the comedy and the heartfelt moments well balanced. Also this film knows what it is and references it but maybe a few too many times. Now the style of the film is quite cool but it also is a bit similar to other films in the genre which doesn't make it that unique. I had a really fun time watching 22 jump street and it makes me want to go back to watch the original.",8,4,11,15 July 2014
Kick-Ass," A fantastic unique film
","Kick Ass is a completely unique superhero film that we haven't seen before and it is completely awesome. This film sees average College student Dave decide he wants to try to be a superhero and protect people until he encounters real superheroes Big Daddy and Hit Girl who are attempting to take down mob boss Frank D'Amico. Now I am not a huge fan of Aaron Taylor Johnson but this is the one exception as I truly believe he is a great Kick Ass and provides a good realistic humour that makes his character really funny. The supporting cast also all do fantastic jobs with Nicholas Cage doing a brilliant job in particular, his character of Big Daddy is great and he is the coolest character in the film and really helps play alongside Kick Ass. His daughter Hit Girl is played by Chloe Grace Moretz and this was really her break out roll with her being an awesome character and her dialogue is awesome especially for the age of the character. When casting a great villain the best is probably Mark Strong and he proves it in this film with an awesome performance as a fantastic villain. His Son Chris D'Amico is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and he does a good job especially contrasting with Mark Strong. The story is the weak point of this film with it being pretty straight forward but it is executed decently I just think there could have been more done to make it more unique. The script is utterly superb with the dialogue and chemistry from each character being utterly hilarious and great. The style of the film is really unique and really provide a different fantastic look on superhero genre, yes it is stylised but it is still great. This is a fantastic film that really makes this film so rewatchable and one of my favourite superhero films.",9,2,4,5 October 2014
The Hurt Locker," an utterly epic story that truly encapsulates war
","I have heard a lot of hype about this film but I wasn't a true believer but now I must say this is one of the greatest war films of all time hands down. This film documents the lives of three men in bravo squad who's jobs it is to defuse bombs. Now in the lead is the always fantastic Jeremy Renner and this film is no different with him stealing the show. His character arc was really interesting and by the end of the film you feel really connected to his character. The supporting cast is also really good with Anthony Mackies performance also standing out and he also had a really interesting character arc. The other member of team was also good with his arc being interesting but a little bit of a step down from the others. There was also some nice cameos from guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes ans Evangeline Lilly even though none of them are in the film that much between them. The story was really interesting with all three of the main characters having interesting stories and interesting finishes helping carry the film throughout. Also the story was much more tense then action and that was a really good decision as it helps build the overall tension throughout the film. The script is really good with the war dialogue feeling real and natural and it helps humanize the characters especially Renner. The style of the film is also great once again emphasising the style over action that really pays off in the middle eastern environment. Overall this is an excellent film and one that everybody should see.",10,0,2,10 December 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A below average retread of previous pirates films
","After not really caring for the last pirates of the Caribbean film I didn't have high expectations for this movie but I went and saw it and I was right to have these low expectations. The premise of the film sees the return of captain jack sparrow as he leads an expedition for the Trident of Poseidon while on the run from an old enemy. Johnny depp has become known for the role of jack sparrow and I think when in that character he usually delivers his best, that was until this film. He has some of the charisma and jack nuances in his performances that makes him entertaining, but this character is a shell of his former self. This is the least funny he has ever been, the least charming he has been and I ended up feeling like he phoned in this performance quite a bit. The supporting cast is pretty large but I will go over the main ones, Salazar played by Javier bardem is the main villain in this film and I thought he was a pretty decent villain. He is a little hard to understand at times but, he is pretty menacing in this film and I liked his back story that makes him also a little sympathetic but then he is menacing and it adds to his performance. Geoffrey rush is back as hector barbosa in this film and like always he is great, I wasn't the biggest fan of some of the things done with his character but rush always gives a fun charismatic performance that does make me smile. However, we get to the new characters played by Brendon thwaites and kaya scodelario who are both completely wooden and lacking. I didn't buy there chemistry at all and I didn't like the involvement of lore to try to make Them interesting because they really weren't. The story is very jumbled and a bit all over the place, similar to stranger tides there is just too many people going after this artifact that you don't even remember them all. The Salazar plot and trident plot feels like two different movies and the meshing just really didn't work. The script has a couple of laughs in it I can't deny that I laughed enough for passable. However, there was a lot of misses in this script with this possibly being the least funny of the films and definitely the film with the least drama and heart in it. The style of this film has some of the pirates action scenes that are very enjoyable especially towards the beginning of the film. But as the film progresses the action felt a bit hollow as I didn't really care about any of the characters. Overall this is the weakest pirates film in my opinion and unless you are a big fan of this franchise like me it isn't really worth a watch.",4,156,241,31 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," A fantastic comic book film that defies the critics
","I had heard some mixed reviews for this film and I don't really see where the negative ones come from because this is a fantastic addition to the X- Men films. The premise sees the film set 10 years after days of future past and an ancient mutant has woken up to destroy the world. James macavoy is back as professor xavier and he feels closer to the character then ever before. He does a great job as a headstrong leader that has to show strong mentality to the characters around him. Michael fassbender reprises his role as magneto and he is easily the most interesting character in this film as he tries to recover his life but he has the pain in his life that makes him drawn to apocalypse. Jennifer lawrence is back as mystique and she is great in the role. She provides a complex performance as the character that makes you care about her character. Oscar isaac plays the villain apocalypse and even though he is underneath allot of make up he delivers a performance full of depth. He is a charismatic leader that allows you to understand why his allies would join him. All the other cast do a great job too, quicksilver has lots of stand out moments and depth to his character. Nightcrawler, jean grey and cyclops also deliver great performances and are good characters. The story of the film continues this series of films very well as a new group of mutants are developed and grow. Even though the villains plot is pretty simple it works because of his depth and delivery. The script has a good blend of drama and humour like all of the singer X-Men films and it helps develop some of the supporting characters such as quicksilver and Cyclops. The style has some great action scenes that come straight from the comics and makes the stakes of this film seem huge. However, the pacing of the film is a little all over the place especially for the first 30 minutes where it tries to set up a few different plot lines and it feels a bit disjointed. Overall this is a fantastic comic book film that is amongst the best in this franchise.",9,12,23,19 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," a fun action packed spidey film for everyone to enjoy
","This film has been receiving a lot of mixed reviews from average movie fans and also the critics and I must say I can see both points of view, however, I really liked this film. The film picks off where the last one ended peter and gwen are still in there awkward relationship and his best friend harry Osbourne has returned. Also in this by an accident the supervillain electro is created. With all this the film can feel a little bit overcrowded with all these tie ins but overall I thought it handed it okay. Once again a great point of this film is the chemistry between Emma stone and Andrew Garfield it's great and one of the best parts of the film to the point that there is one point in this film where it got quite emotional and really made this film a great film in my opinion. Whereas in my opinion villains in previous spider man villains have just been villains for no reason there is logical reasons why both characters would want revenge on spider man, Jamie Foxx is good in this film as electro but the scene stealer is Dane dehan as harry Osbourne he was my favourite character of the film. The biggest negative is that because of the insane levels of marketing for this film it just doesn't live up to the hype of it and important parts of the trailer aren't even in the movie! Also towards the end it does feel a little long and like they are just totally setting up for sinister 6 and s3 which I hope are good. In my opinion this film is worthy of being a spider man film and is great",8,1,6,9 May 2014
Ex Machina," A great refreshing sci fi
","I have heard allot of good things about this film and I have finally seen it and this is a great film. The premise of this film sees a coder get invited to his eccentric bosses island to conduct a week long test on the first ever artificial intelligence. Now newcomer Alicia vikander plays ava the artificial intelligence and she does a fantastic job in this film. You truly buy her as this AI who is learning as the film progresses and becomes more and more interesting. Domnhall gleeson plays caleb the coder and he also does a really good job in this film as he is the guy that we see everything through and he is the most relatable character in the film. Oscar issac plays the eccentric nathan and he is really good in this film, you can tell that there is something a bit shady about the guy but he seems pretty likable in the film. Lets just say I can't wait to see both of these guys in star wars the force awakens. The story of this film is pretty interesting as you see this artificial intelligence grow as these two guys develop and grow. However, it does end up being a bit of a simple plot looking at humanity. Also I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the film either. The script was really good with some funny witty dialogue that actually feels very natural and human like. The style of the film looks beautiful with all the cinematography coming across very well. However, there is a bit of a pacing issue in this film that slows the film down quite allot. Overall this is a great sci fi film that you should definitely see.",8,1,3,11 November 2015
Back to the Future Part III," A fantastic end to a brilliant trilogy
","I have finally finished rewatching the back to the future trilogy and this is a fantastic finish to the trilogy. After the events of the previous film the doc travels back in time to 1885. He leaves a letter for marty who decides to go back and save the doc. Michael j fox is back as marty mcfly and he is back with the same charm and charisma that he showed us in the previous films. He truly fits in the wild west and the character really goes out on a high. However, the most interesting character in this film is doc brown played by christopher lloyd. His character is really given depth in this film and he combines his romance with the quirky fun moments that have made him such a beloved character. Mary steenburgen is the new love interest for doc and they have great chemistry together. Thomas f Wilson is back but this time as the cowboy mad dog tannen and he is a fun villain for this film. The story has some good drama involved with the romance and the new setting really helps. However, my only complaint for this film is the lack of imagination in the story. Some of the characters feel forced in and the situations aren't as imaginative as the previous films. The script is great, it once again combines humour and drama really well to flesh out these characters. The style is great with allot of fun in the action scenes that makes this film flow really well. Overall this is a fantastic third instalment that should definitely be seen along with the other back to the future films.",9,4,4,29 March 2016
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A vast improvement on the original but still not to the level of other comic book films
","After watching the garbage that is the first Fantastic Four I have no idea why I watched this film but I must say I was a little bit pleasantly surprised as this film is much better and above average to watch it was decent. This film starts with Reed Richards and Sue Storm attempting to get married when a herald called the Silver Surfer comes to Earth to prepare its destruction. With the help of Victor Von Doom the Fantastic Four attempt to find a way to stop the Silver Surfer and his master the eater of worlds Galactus. Now one of my big gripes with the first film was the performances of Mr Fantastic and The Invisible Woman aka Reed and Sue but I must say they were improved a lot in this film. The guy who plays Reed who's name escapes me takes more charge in this film and starts to become more of a leader that he should be. Jessica Alba once again looks beautiful but her acting really does improve and she does a fine job getting across her feelings well in this film. Now just like the first film I thought Chris Evans did a good job as Johnny Storm and he had great lines with a funny attitude. The Thing was once again done well with some good comedic timing and some great chemistry with Johnny. They also made up for the terrible Dr Doom we got in the first film with a decent Doom in this film McMahon was evil, cunning and his ambitions were clear unlike the first film really. But the best character in my opinion is that of The Silver Surfer himself Laurence Fishburne does a superb job with the voice work as he sounds chilling and evil when he needs to be and sympathetic when he needs to be. The Surfer is one of the best things in this movie in every way I just wish we could have got a little more of him. The story like the first one isn't a strong one, it is so cliché with its narrative and doesn't really add anything to the plot that would be surprising to anybody. I must say the script was better then the first with some witty humour and heartfelt moments, plus the Surfers great lines. But some of it does fall flat and some of the dialogue we could have just done without. The style of the film was good The Surfer looked great, Doom looked great and the Fantastic Four looked great plus the locations were great. But I only give this a good mark not great because as a fan of the character of Galactus I was massively disappointed what they did with him and I am sure others are too. So overall this is an improvement but it isn't a film you need to rush out and see. It'll be decent but nothing like Iron Man or Thor levels of quality.",6,1,2,18 August 2014
Grudge Match," A good film that is not as bad as you have heard
","I originally really wanted to see Grudge Match but I just never got around to it and now I have heard that it was really bad, but it is in fact good. The film sees two ageing boxers who 30 years prior had a rivalry with score 1-1 and now they are looking to finish the rivalry. Now Stallone and De Niro were both good in the film with De Niro providing the comedy and Stallone the tough guy and the dynamic between the two worked well. The supporting cast is also really good with Kevin Hart being really good with him being hilarious throughout and adding allot of energy to the film. Alan Arkin also did a good job with his comedic timing adding a lot to the film. Jon Bernthal also did a good job with his chemistry with De Niro being good throughout the film and even though I think her character wasn't really necessary Kim Bassinger did a decent job. I do like sports and rivalries stories and when this film focuses on that the style is good, but there are too many unimportant side stories that should have been cut out of the film. The script is alright with some of the dialogue being great, however, there are some times where people talk over each other and also the end of the film is quite predictable. The style is good when once again it focuses on the rivalry but is quite generic otherwise. Overall this film is good and better then what you have heard.",7,1,1,10 November 2014
Transformers," CGI Marvel of fun
","This film is all about one thing for me watching big robots beating each other up and in this film that was a success. The autobots led by Optimus Prime are in a battle with their long enemies the Decepticons of this greater power called the All Spark. With many scenes and performances by the human actors we get to the final fight scene which is literally one of the craziest fighting scenes ever. The performance of Shia Labeouf, Megan Fox and the other soldiers are good but the whole point of this film really is around all these transformers fighting and when they do it is a marvel. Michael Bay is well known for big explosions and action but in this film it is perfect and he gets these encounters between these different transformers as good as it possibly gets. This film is fun, exciting and action packed leading to a great 2 1/2 hours that are fun and easy to watch.",8,4,5,12 March 2014
Hidden Figures," A good Biopic that has an interesting backstory
","This film has had allot of Oscar buzz since it came out so I thought I would give it a watch and I did enjoy Hidden Figures but I do think it is slightly overrated. The premise of this film sees three black women trying to overcome segregation to work in the space program and try and get a man into space for the US. Taraji P Henson plays the lead in this film and she does a fantastic job in this film, she is the woman who works out NASA'S numbers and trajectory and you see just how vital she is to the space race. Her performance is great as she combines a real likability mixed with the drama she feels with the situation she is involved in. I loved seeing her wok with the numbers and seeing just how good she is at it makes her great to watch. Octavia Spencer plays the head of the black women at NASA and she does a really good job in this film. You can see she is a very strong character and good at there job even though due to social problems she probably doesn't get the respect that she deserves. Janelle Monae plays the third friend and she wants to be the first black female engineer in NASA. She was fantastic in this film and I really bought her character arc and I really enjoyed seeing how she developed in this film. Kevin Costner plays the head of NASA and he does an excellent job in this film, he truly encapsulated what NASA were trying to achieve with hard work and dedication. He had great chemistry with Henson and Jim parsons and you see this good guy stressed by this time sensitive situation that he is put under. I am not usually a big Kirsten Dunst fan but she was pretty good in this film and I thought her and Spencer had good chemistry in their scenes in this film. The story of this film has allot going on in it, I really liked Henson and Monae's story arcs, I found them interesting and heartfelt as you see them try to succeed in this world. However, I didn't really care for Spencer's story arc and even though important it did feel tacked on and not as interesting as the other story arcs in the film. The script has some pretty decent dramatic dialogue as you see these characters have to deal with different situations that they shouldn't. The film has some attempts of humour and I just felt that it didn't really work and din't help the characters when these situations took place. The style of this film has some interesting subject matter and I did really enjoy the workings of NASA and how these different people contribute to the overall cause. But I felt like some of the more dramatic scenes didn't come across as well as they could have done which hurt the overall quality of this film. Overall I liked this film and think if you are interested in the subject matter it is definitely worth a watch.",7,0,4,20 February 2017
1917," A Fantastic Truly Beautiful Film
","This film recently got nominated for best picture at the Oscars, so I had to see what all the fuss was about and I have now seen 1917 and this is my review of the film.
Main Character
This film actually has two lead characters, relative unknowns George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman and after this film I am sure I will see more performances from them in the future. They are both fantastic in this film and have really good chemistry together, they give very physical performances and you really do care about them as they go on this daring mission. Mackay in particular stands out and gives a memorable performance that was highly impressive.
Supporting Characters
Now this is a hard category for this film as the film truly focuses on these two actors and nobody else, don't get me wrong seeing Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott in entertaining but small roles provides this film with legitimacy and star power. But as mentioned I have to be fair and say this film maybe doesn't do enough with it's supporting characters to make you care about them.
Story
The story is pretty engrossing, the journey that these two people go on is very tense and emotional, you support them all the way and you want to see them succeed. It isn't the most unique story but it makes up for it in how intense it is and how it make you feel a part of their journey and how you are the third man in the group supporting them all the way.Script
The script is very good, obviously the film is very serious and it nails its dramatic dialogue to encapsulate just how dark the situation they are in, though, when used the humour feels appropriate and well placed for a pair of friends travelling together.Style
Now we get onto the star of the film and that is cinematographer Roger Deakins, this is possibly the best looking movie I have ever seen. The film is shot in one continous shot and it feels perfect for this film and allows you to get immersed in this WW1 setting and you feel like you are with the characters. The musical score adds to the drama of the situation and I cannot stress how tense this film is and how it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Overall
This is a fantastic film experience, one of the best war based film in recent memory. Any big film fan needs to see this film mainly for its style and how beautiful it is to watch.",9,0,2,16 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A fantastic star wars film
","This has been my most anticipated film for about 2 years now and I am happy to report that star wars the last jedi is a fantastic complex film. The premise of the film is set just after the events of the force awakens and sees rey attempt to get Luke skywalker to train her, meanwhile, the resistance attempts to stay out of the clutches of the first order. Daisy ridley became a star after her performance in the force awakens and she is great here too, she is still that tough female protagonist from the previous film that's owns the film. Onto Mark Hamill as Luke skywalker, he is brilliant in this film. He gives a really good dramatic performance but also keeps the heart of the character alive in this brilliant performance. Also his chemistry with ridley really carries this film especially for the first half of the film. Adam driver reprises his role as Kylo ren and once again he provides a very complex and emotional performance. Just like the previous film, there is lots of conflict in his performance and it really makes him a fascinating character. Oscar isacc gets alot more to do as poe dameron in this film and he is great., his enthusiasm is infectious and it really allows a fun performance. John boyega is given a bit less to do as finn this time around but he gives a fun performance that you would expect. Unfortunately, this is Carrie fishers last film due to her sad passing but she gives a great final performance as leia really paying respect to her. The story has a few different story arcs in it and I really enjoyed the majority of them, as mentioned before the scenes on the island involving rey and Luke are fascinating and possibly my favourite part of the movie. This film takes a lot of bold directions in it that might upset some people but I thought they really worked. However, there is one story arc I found to be really lacking and that involved finn and a new character called rose and it just felt like filler and it didn't really engage me. The script has similar humour to the last film and I felt when used it worked for the majority of the the film. The drama really worked too adding depth to pretty much every character in this film. The style of the film is absolutely beautiful, the cinematography is a step up even on the last film, the space battles are great and rival even that of rogue one. Overall this is a fantastic star wars film that proves this series has plenty of life in it yet.",7,5,22,14 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A truly excellent film that proves just how good Marvel truly is
","When it was revealed that marvel were making guardians of the galaxy everyone around the world was surprised and that is probably why this is one of the biggest surprises in film history as this film is excellent. The premise of the film sees a group of criminals come together come together to take down a fanatical warrior who plans to destroy a planet. Chris Pratt was really a big of an unknown when he was cast in this role but he is fantastic he is really funny and charismatic which makes you really like his character in this film. Zoe saldana plays the assassin gamora in this film and her back story in this film is incredible and she was great in the action scenes that readymade her character cool. Dave bautista is one of the best wrestlers of recent memory but nobody could believe just how good an actor he truly is. He was so awesome as drax the destroyer because he managed to get across the dramatic part of his character and also had so much humour to him in this film. Vin diesel voices the big tree groot in this film and his character was just plain awesome in this film with the visuals being fantastic and the character being so lovable. We then get to the show stealer with Bradley Cooper as rocket raccoon and he is one of the best characters I have seen in recent memory. He is quick witted and hilarious but he also had some layers to him that made him an interesting character in this fun film. When I first watched this film I thought Ronan was a weak villain but now I get his motivations and his back story I think he is a decent enough villain for this first film because the film is all about the guardians. The story of this film is pretty simple but it works the director didn't try and overcomplicate things, he made it simple and relied on the characters to make this film cool. The script is fantastic with all the humour and drama in it making this film feel alive and unique in its script. The style of this film is awesome and it felt like the perfect mid of star wars and star trek which I am a a big fan of. Also the soundtrack isn't usually something I would mention but it is amazing in this film. Overall this film was an absolutely huge surprise because nobody expected the highest quality but this film delivered.",10,0,3,13 August 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A great addition to the Tarantino collection
","Quentin Tarantino is quite a controversial director but I really believe that he is one of the best ever and I love his style with Kill Bill vol 1 being another great film. The story sees a woman called the Bride waking up from a coma with revenge on her mind after she was shot in the head and her unborn child dead from the attack. Now Uma Thurman was attempting to recover from the horrible thing that was Batman and Robin and she was great in this film. She was one of the biggest bad asses ever and really used her acting ability to get across why she id looking for revenge without much info on why. Lucy Liu is the main adversary and she does a good job with the action scenes, and her and Thurman's chemistry was good. However, apart from her the rest of the side characters looked good for the small time they were in the film but they weren't given a lot of screen time probably setting up more screen time in the future. The story is quite basic with her looking for a quest of revenge that was cool but also quite basic, I did really like the twist also that happened at the end of the film. But as I said before there isn't a lot explained and also I hated the anime scenes as I thought they really took me out of the film. The script is just like all Tarantino films with it being fun and witty with the dialogue being great between everybody. The style is also something that is considered controversial but I love it because it is over the top but all the action and story are over the top so it fit perfectly. Overall I don't think this is one of Tarantino's best films but it still is a great film to his library.",8,1,5,5 November 2014
Here Comes the Boom," A great real feel good film
","I like a good sports film so I thought I would watch this film with low expectations and I ended up really enjoying this film. The premise of this film Sees a biology teacher attempt to train in MMA so he can save the music department and the teachers job. Kevin James is very hit and miss with mostly misses but this is the best I have ever seen him. He is really funny in his film and he adds lots of depth to his character that makes you root to him and care about him succeeding to help save this guy's job. You see him progress throughout the film and really get some pride out of possibly having a chance to win these fights. Henry Winkler plays the music teacher in the film and he is great, he is just such a likable guy and you end up liking him so much. You truly understand why James is going through these fights to save this guy's job. I loved Niko who is James trainer and he was hilarious in this film and was just a great character that has great chemistry with james. I also really liked how all the kids in his class become more interested in him and school as the film develops. Salma hayek plays his love interest in this film and she doesn't really add allot to the film but is competent in the role. The story is really uplifting as you see this guy doing everything he can to help somebody else an try and make his school a better place. It's a really motivating movie and you really do care about the journey the characters go through. But I will admit that this film is incredibly predictable and a bit cliché as you can probably guess the ending of this film. The script has some really good dialogue in this film both dramatic and humour that really helped build the characters and really make me laugh and care. The style of the UFC fights are really good an you totally buy James starting to get better at the fights as the film progresses. But there is some pointless things in the movie to pad it out and also some toilet humour that just doesn't work. Overall though I really enjoyed this film and I think it is definitely worth a watch.",8,0,1,19 December 2016
Jurassic World," a great addition to this beloved franchise
","In the summer of sequels and reboots after 14 years we have the next Jurassic park film : Jurassic world and I am happy to report that this is a great film. The premise of this movie is set 20 years after the original Jurassic park and the park is now open as a theme park. With attendances down corporate decide they need a new attraction and after creating a new type of dinosaur it escapes and chaos ensues. Now I loved Chris pratts performance in guardians of the galaxy and in this film he proves that it is absolutely no fluke as he is great. He was his charismatic self with allot of humour and depth to the character which made him a really cool lead for this film. Bryce Dallas Howard is the head of the park and at the beginning of the film I didn't really like her character but I like the arc her character goes through in the film and by the time we are meant to care about her character I did. Now their are some awful characters in this film and the two kids are a big part of it. It's not the actors thats the problem it's the amount of time the story focuses on them and just the fact that there characters aren't interesting at all. Fresh from playing Wilson fisk in daredevil Vincent donofrio is a military villain in this film and it's not that his performance is that bad it's just that his plan is crazy and that his character is writ to be really cliché and it makes you to not care about his character. the creation of the indominous rex was a great villain and she really was a great killing machine for this film. Now one thing I like is that they make out that corporate is the reason for the creation of the indominous rex is that corporate needed more attractions was interesting and made complete sense. I also liked the character arcs of Howard and Pratt with also the undertones of the franchise kept in play. However, there are allot of side stories that I really did not care about and I think it takes away from the whole experience of the film. The script is great with a great blend of humour and drama that do flesh out some of the characters and make the horror of the situation feel real. A great part of the film is that the style of this film completely catches the awe and and wonder that Jurassic park had and use cgi to enhance the dinosaurs and make them feel even more bigger. The fight scenes are great and make the dinosaurs feel like huge attractions and prove that they are really the stars of the film. Overall this is a great film and I can't wait to see the eventual sequels that will definitely come with this film.",7,9,29,20 June 2015
Mission: Impossible II," a really poor attempt at a spy thriller
",I must admit that I did like the first mission impossible film quite a bit but this film is just poor in anybody's book. This film sees the return of Ethan hunt as he looks to stop an old ally from releasing a deadly virus on the world. Now I really did like tom cruise's performance in the first film but something just seems a bit off with him in this film. I mean he still does a decent job but he just seemed lethargic and not really interested. The side characters are a mixed bag with both the villain and his main henchman being more like cartoons then realistic representations of what villains should be in a film like this. But I thought Ethan's New love interest nya did a good job and she has pretty good chemistry with cruise even tough the story does make it hard to believe. Also another thing I liked is that they gave ving rhames's character luthor a bigger role in this and I believe he does a really good job easily being my favourite character in the film. In the first film one thing I really liked was the story and the twists and turns they took but in this film there is no such luck. The story is unnecessarily complicated and none of the reasoning for actions are ever really explained at all. The script is okay with hunt and nya having some good dialogue between them but also none of the villains had any good lines and a lot of the dialogue did feel forced. But easily the biggest complaint I have with this film is its style of the film. There was so much slow motion it became insulting and it really took me out of the film. This film is a massive let down and makes me look less forward to the 3rd film.,3,0,1,13 October 2014
Black Hawk Down," Absoluetly epic moving emotional tale
","I have to admit going into this film I had high hopes because I do enjoy war films and this is the up there with the best war films and films period. This film is based on a true story that in the early ninety's a group of Un troops are sent to capture a couple of Somalian criminals that are part of a dictator's reign. There is a lot of characters in this film and they look similar so at the beginning it is hard to feel invested in these characters but once they get into the battlefield this is one of the most gut-wrenching emotional experiences I have seen in film. Ewan McGregor is my favourite character in this film as he is the one character that seems to have the same feelings as we the audience would do if we were thrust in this situation just like he is. Now a lot of people would argue that this is just a mindless action film but oh my goodness how wrong that is these people grow on you as they are put in this undesirable situation. Also deep themes are played out such as freedom, sacrifice and liberation and this adds to the total realism that the action shows. I just believe this film is an emotional roller-coaster and I advise anybody to watch it.",10,2,2,24 March 2014
Prisoners," A great emotional journey
","With the new blade runner film being directed by Dennis Villeneuve I decided to watch this film which is also directed by Dennis Villeneuve and this is a great emotional film. The premise of the film sees two six year old girls go missing, with the police and there families looking for them a detective and one of the father's try to come up with ways to find them. Hugh Jackman plays the dad in this film and he is truly amazing in this film, he brings out so much emotion in this film and you care about his character so much. You understand why he takes the actions he does because of his situation even though you may not agree with them. Jake gyllenhall plays the detective in this film and he is fantastic in this role, you understand the situation that he is put in and you understand the actions that he takes as well. It is great watching him and Jackman go at it to decide the best way about going about this situation. Viola Davis and Terence Howard play the other child's parents in this film and they both give great performances in this film, seeing them interacting with Jackman is great as you see both sides of view of how the parents are reacting which is pretty fascinating. Paul dano is also really good as one of the suspects and it is really interesting to watch how his character is treated. The story is so fascinating to watch as you see these people all try and use there own methods to tracking down these girls with some people possibly crossing some lines. I also liked the ending of this film which is pretty crucial for how much you will enjoy this film. The script has some truly brilliant dramatic dialogue that will make you feel a lot of empathy for these characters. The only problem is because of the subject matter being very serious there is no humour in this film at all which i do understand even though I think it hurts the rewatchable nature of this film. The style of the film is very engrossing and beautiful to look at, I felt myself locked in to what happens with these characters. However, this film is quite long and it does drag at times which makes this film sometimes feel even longer then it actually is. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and advise if you like really serious thrillers then this is a must watch.",8,1,2,19 July 2017
Silence," A great really interesting film
","Like most people I think Martin scorcese is a great director and I was interested in seeing his new film silence and I did really enjoy this film. The premise of this film sees two Catholics travel to Japan to find there teacher who has gone missing. Andrew garfield plays rodrigues The main priest In this film and I am sure there will be Oscar buzz around this performance. He is absolutely amazing in this film and truly commits to this role, he delivers a truly great performance with great depth as you see him go through this horrible journey and see him become more and more broken as the film progresses in a fantastic way. Adam driver plays the other priest in this film an he does a really good job with what he is given. He has less to do then Garfield but he still adds allot of depth to his character and you do care about his character. Liam neeeson plays the teacher and with his limited screen time does a great job of conveying why these men would go on this mission in the first place. The rest of the Japanese cast does a fantastic job too whether it's the inquisitor, the interpreter or the villagers they all deliver high quality performances that makes you truly care about where they go in this film. The story has really good depth in it as you see these two guys faith being questioned and you see them go through this really emotional journey through has you invested. However,it isn't the most fast paced film with its storytelling and the last third of the film drags quite allot and becomes predictable. The script is great with dramatic dialogue that you buy and makes you care about the characters in the film. A film like this has a lack of humour but it works for this film because of the subject matter. The style of this film is beautiful, if just based on cinematography alone this film would be a 10/10. But this films pacing is really sloppy, this is a very long film but it feels even longer and I just feel like there were parts of this film could have been cut out and it would have benefited the film. Overall this is a great interesting film that if your a fan of film is a must watch in my opinion.",8,4,13,2 January 2017
Logan," A fantastic dark real take on wolverine
","For years we have seen Hugh Jackman play the character of Wolverine, and I have now seen possibly his final performance as the character in Logan and I loved it. The premise sees an older more damaged Logan taking care of an ill Charles Xavier, when they encounter a new young mutant who they must protect from dark forces. Hugh Jackman reprises his iconic role as Logan and I think this may be his best ever, he is clearly a more aged, impatient version of the character and you totally buy his more pessimistic viewpoint on life at the beginning of the film. I love his character growth throughout the film and you buy the emotion he conveys from this truly emotional gut wrenching performance that is award worthy. Patrick Stewart plays Xavier again in this film and he is brilliant in this much different damaged performance. We are used to seeing Stewart as the confident wise teacher but in this film he is ill, damaged and broken and it is such an interesting take on the character that Stewart nails out of the park. Dafne keen plays Laura the young girl in this film and she is great in this film especially considering it is her first ever role. Her, Jackman and Stewarts chemistry is fantastic in this film and I really did buy their little dysfunctional family that slowly grows. Plus she is absolutely great in the action scenes along with Jackman. Boyd Holbrook plays the villain in this film and he was pretty good in this film, he was menacing when he wanted to be and cocky when he wanted to be. I also thought Stephen merchant did a pretty good job as Caliban even though he isn't in this film that much. The story of this film is a very simple escort mission to get laura to safety and it really works, the emotion between the characters carries this story and really makes you care about them and the situation that they are put into. The script has some great dramatic dialogue that does sell the dire straights that these characters are in as they try to survive in the world. There is very little humour in the film but what is there did make me chuckle a bit and in a real way. The style of the film is very dark and despondent which really works for the situation that the characters are in and the awesome gritty bloody violence that has been needed in a wolverine film forever. However, my one negative for this film is that it is a little too long and I feel like there are some real pacing issues that make this film feel even longer then it actually is. Overall though I loved this film and I urge anybody who is a fan of wolverine or just good movies that you have to see this film.",9,2,9,1 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," a brilliant sequel that was everything I wanted
","You know when you are so excited for a movie that it can actually end up being a total disappointment well Avengers age of Ultron is not one of those films because it is awesome. The premise of the film sees Tony stark attempt to create an artificial intelligence to protect the world but it ends up turning on him and becoming the villainous Ultron hell bent on wanting to destroy the human race. Now there are allot of people in this film but the main ones are Robert Downey jnr as iron man and Chris Evans as captain America. These two are so different but there so awesome there chemistry is fantastic and really helps carry the film. Obviously there are some teasers for civil war and I think this film perfectly sets up that film. Now to the rest of the cast, Chris hemsworth is back as Thor and he is really funny in this film and is still the warriors that makes him so cool. I wasn't a huge fan of his story arc in this film but he was great. Scarlett Johansson is back as black widow and she proves just why she is the best female action star going right now and learning more about her backstory was really interesting. The hulk is back in this film and he is more brutal then ever before which makes him more cool then ever before and more conflicted then ever before. Now one thing people will argue that Hawkeye was an uninteresting character in the first film but he stole the show in this film we learn more about him and he had some of the best lines that made him the coolest avenger in the film which made me really happy. Now the new group of characters first of all is James spader as Ultron, he was the villain that I wanted for this film. He was evil and dark but there was also a surprising amount of great humour to him which made him a really interesting character in the film. There was some controversy when quicksilver and Scarlett witch was chosen for this film but they really added a great dynamic to the film. Especially Scarlett witch who is awesome in the film and her powers are something we haven't really seen in a comic book film before. Last of all Paul Bettany comes to life as the vision and boy does the character make this film better and his character is so important to the whole film and the future of the universe. Now before the film I had a few worries about to much going on but now I realise that this wasn't a problem and actually the premise was simple but great. I loved the character development for all the characters which made The film's story great. The script was Greta with more humour in it then probably any other marvel film but it also nailed the drama as well to make our care about all the characters. The style of the film is obviously great with all the action being great and allowing the characters to shine in the best way possible and I liked seeing how Ultron evolved throughout the film. Overall this film is epic and one of the best comic book films of all time.",10,5,13,25 April 2015
The Dark Knight," Best comic book film ever
","When it is discussed what is the greatest comic book film of all time I understand why some people will pick films like The Avengers, however, this film has no equal and is the greatest comic book film of all time. This film is set almost a year after Batman Begins with Batman, Lieutenant Gordon and new District Attorney Harvey Dent taking down the mob until the criminal known as The Joker brings a reign of terror to Gotham. First of all Christian Bale is the best Bruce Wayne/Batman we have ever had as he personified the split personalities that Wayne has to go through and he really nails the way his character has to interact with different characters in different situations. The supporting cast are also all awesome and you can't talk about this film without talking about the late Heath Ledger's Oscar winning performance as The Joker. This is easily the greatest performance in a comic book film ever with Ledger personifying the character of The Joker with the terrifying nature and also the dark humour the character truly has. Michael Cain returned as Alfred and his role was great with his comic relief providing a great contrast to the dark tone of the film. Aaron Eckhart was a bit of a surprise as Harvey Dent and he was fantastic with this performance showing his true acting ability giving the character justice with this phenomenal performance. Recasting can be difficult for some people but I think Maggie Gyllenhall did a good job as Rachel Dawes with her chemistry with Bale being good and her role being important to the overall story, also it must be mentioned that Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman return and once again do great in their roles. The story really links to Batman lore and adds layers to what could have been a simplistic story, it also adds shocking moments that make the story feel just epic. The script is superb with the dialogue being superb and the back and forth between characters especially Joker being phenomenal. The style is perfect for the film, with the dark, gritty style really working for this more realistic world that this Batman is set in. Overall this is one of the best films of all time and is phenomenal, I am glad Heath Ledger got this phenomenal performance before his tragic passing and I hope he is remembered for this epic performance.",10,0,2,19 March 2014
Everest," A good adventure film
","I have just seen the film Everest and I will say that this is a pretty decent film. The premise is based on a true story and sees a group of expeditioners attempt to climb mount Everest when a dangerous snowstorm hits. Jason Clarke plays the main guy in this film and he does a really good job. His character was the most interesting in this film and you care about him the most because of his life at home. Josh brolin is also in this film and does a good job, you also care about his character because of his good performance. Jake Gyllenhaal was also really good in this film as a carefree climber that developed as the film progresses and you care about him. Sam Worthington is surprisingly pretty good in this role as he tries to help Clarke in the situation. The story has a pretty good man vs nature theme as you see these people try to survive the conditions. However, the film lacks any real interesting narrative and the story seems to be forgotten. The script has some great dramatic dialogue that will make you care about the characters. However, I do slightly wish there had been a little more humour in the film to sometimes alleviate the tension. The style has fantastic cinematography that really makes you feel like your on the adventure with the group. However, the pacing of the film is all over the place and it feels really slow too much of the time. Overall this is a pretty decent film that is worth a watch.",7,0,1,15 July 2016
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," An epic more intense film
",I have enjoyed all of the harry potter films so far but I must say this film is easily my favourite so far. The premise sees the ministry of magic accuse harry and Dumbledore of lying about Voldemort's return. Daniel Radcliffe was a fantastic choice as harry potter and this is by far his best performance as the character to date. There is allot of depth to the performance as he tries to move on from the events of the previous film and how it just weighs on him in this film and it is fantastic. Rupert grint and Emma Watson have truly grown into the roles of Ron and Hermione and they are great in this film. Especially Hermione who develops into a more fun character in this film which I liked. Gary oldman is back as Sirius black in a bigger role and he is great in this film as a real father figure to harry in his life. Dolores umbridge is introduced in this film and my goodness she is a horrible person but she really works in this film as the horrible antagonist. Every character in this film and some of the lesser characters roles are expanded on which is good to see. The story is really good in this film as you see harry truly disturbed by Voldemort's return and how he has to deal with it. I also enjoyed the slightly more serious plot involving the state of Hogwarts that helps make this film excellent. The script has allot of great drama to it that makes this film a bit more epic. There is also good humour in this film that helps add to the humanity to the characters. The style has some great action scenes in it that make you feel the scale of wizard powers. Also this film is definitely the best paced so far. Overall I truly loved this film and think it is the best of the harry potter films so far.,10,1,5,9 August 2016
War Machine," A poor film that didn't really know what it wanted to achieve
","I am usually interested in netflixs original products and this film has Brad Pitt in it so I had some interest in this film but yeah this film is pretty poor. The premise of this film sees a respected charismatic war general sent to Afghanistan to sort out the war effort that is happening over there. Brad pitt plays the general in this film and he is very good in this film, he has a lot of charisma in this film and he was easily the funniest character in this film. He is overacting a little bit but it does really work for this role and alludes to the fact that he is the only person I cared about in this film. The supporting cast in this film has some pretty decent actors in this film such as topher grace, will poulter and RJ cyler who was the best part of the recent power rangers movie. But nobody was given anything to do in this film and you won't care about anybody in this film other then brad Pitt. The story in this film is just really bland, nothing is really going on except a lot of political dialogue that you just won't care about. The film has a really poor structure in it and when the end happens you will wonder what the point of this film really was. The film is marketed as a dark comedy and I will say that I did chuckle at some of the humour but I don't believe it is that dark at all. Towards the end of this film it tries to get more dramatic and it totally misses the mark. The style of the film is all over the place, the tone is so inconsistent that you won't really be able to follow everything accurately because you won't care. Overall this is another disappointment from a Netflix movies and it really isn't worth a watch at all.",3,17,34,29 May 2017
Men in Black," A Fantastic fun film
","In preparation for the new Men In Black film, my intention is to go back and watch the first three films in the franchise. So i have now watched the orignial Men In Black Film and it is just a fun fanatstic easy film to watch. The premise of the film sees an experienced and novice special agent go on the hunt to stop an alien threat. Tommy Lee Jones plays Agent K in this film, this is one of the best roles that he has had in my opinion, he has such a dry sense of humour in this film that it really contrasts very well with Will Smith's sense of humour in the film. I can't see anybody else playing the mentor role in this film other thn Tommy Lee Jones' agent K in this film. Will Smith plays his partner Agent J and their chemistry is brilliant in this film, it really takes this good premise and makes it a fantatsic premise. When this film was made Smith was huge and he plays his usual self in this film but it really works as a juxtaposition to Jones character. I also really liked Rip Torn as the head of the MIB, he just has quite a bit of charisma for the role and it is enjoyable to see. Vincent Donofrio plays the villain in this film but I didn't like his character, he is a great actor but this role didn't work for me and actually felt quite childish in this film. I also didn't care for the female character in the film, she hasn't got much to do in the film and you don't really find out much about her. The story is great seeing this unlikely duo together in this fun universe dealing with an alien threat. The story moves at a very quick pace and it really works and makes this film such a fun enjoyable film. The script is great with a blend of humour and suprisingly good drama that rises this above your average buddy cop film. The style has some great unique ideas in it, the alien designs and tech are inspired and feel very natural in this universe. Overall this is a fantastic film that is the pinnacle of buddy cop films.",9,1,1,15 June 2019
Elysium," An exciting sci-fi that blew me away
","Before watching this film I had heard mixed reviews about this film and I am truly in the camp of those that love this film and see it as a great new sci-fi film. The story starts with the poor on the destroyed Earth where the rich people are in heaven in space on Elysium and due to unforeseen circumstances Matt Damon's character Max must invade Elysium to survive. Now Matt Damon's performance is really good and he is a charismatic and tragic character throughout this whole story. The supporting characters are really good too Jodie Foster plays the head of security on Elysium and she plays her evil woman role well and it seems to have been natural. The villain mercenary Kruger played by Sharlto Copley is the best performance as he does his job very well, his accent is unique and he is truly menacing. The story is good and it gives a reason for everything to occur and it gives this whole circumstance a logical reason for it to happen. The script is average and doesn't really stand out as one of the huge strengths of the film but it also isn't a huge negative. The style is the best part of this film as the Elysium reminds me of the citadel in Mass Effect and it just looks cool and with the tech and droids it reminded me of Star Wars which is a huge positive and Earth stands out as a complete contrast. This film also looks at social issues in our lives in this futuristic lifestyle. unfortunately there is quite a bit of shaky cam which I cannot stand and some of the information is loaded in a small amount of time. But overall this is a fantastic film with a lot of positives.",9,3,5,11 June 2014
Taken," A really fun time with a fantastic lead performance
","When this film was announced I was looking forward to seeing Liam Neeson in this role because i really like him and i believe it really suited him. The plot of this film is pretty simple Liam Neeson is a retired spy and after his daughter is kidnapped by Albanian Sex traders he goes on a one man crusade to find her. Now as I said Liam Neeson is superb in this film with everything he does and he is one of the biggest bad asses ever in film on his one man crusade. One thing that is extremely disappointing is the fact that there are no interesting side characters at all, his daughter isn't interesting, his ex wife isn't interesting, his French colleague isn't interesting but the worst is that there isn't a real villain for Neeson to face and that would have truly added to this film. Yes this film's plot is basic but sometimes basic is good and the way the plot is shot and the way Neeson's performance emphasises it, the plot's simplicity is what makes it great. The script is great with Neeson having that now iconic monologue on the telephone and his whole dialogue is great and makes us feel for his character. The style is unique and I really like it the quick shots make us feel like we are with Neeson and the location of Paris was a really good choice for the film. This is a great film and I really want to see Taken 2 now.",8,1,1,11 September 2014
Avatar," A Great Iconic Film
","In preparation for watching Alita : Battle Angel, I decided to watch a film that revolutionised how CGI is used in Avatar the highest grossing film of all time. The premise of the film sees a disabled human travel to an alien planet where he makes a connection with the natives. Sam Worthington was relativley new in this film and I thought he did an okay job in this film, his dead pan humour actually worked in this film and made him a bit enjoyable to watch. But most of the time he is just bland and boring as a performer in most of his films including this one. The supporting cast is very good, Zoe Saldana plays Neytiri the local to the planet and she does a very good job in her role, I actually found her character interesting and i cared about her more then the main character. Sigourney Weaver does a great job in this film, she delivers a charismatic, charming performance showing just how good an actress she can be when she commits to a role. Stephen Lang plays a villain in this film and he is so fun to watch in this film, he revels in the role and is just an entertaining character to watch in this film. Giovanni Ribisi isn't in this film a huge amount but he is a really good actor and I enjoyed watching him in his role in the film. The story is simple to watch, it is executed okay with you buying into the story as the film develops. However, this film is incredibly predictable and you realise that you know the ending way before it takes place. The script is good with a decent mix of drama and umour, at times the humour suprised me as it actually made me laugh at times. The style of the film was the biggest selling point for this film and 10 years later it mostly still holds up and looks fantastic. The colour used in the film makes this such a vibrant film to watch and adds to the conflict in the film. Also even though this film is almost 3 hours long it flows very well and I was enjoyed throughout. Overall this film is a great spectacle to watch that is definitly worth a watch.",8,0,1,5 February 2019
Selma," A fantastic film that celebrates martin Luther kings life
","I have heard allot of good things about Selma and I have finally seen it and it is a fantastic film. The film documents an important part of Dr martin Luther king jnrs life as he tries to get the vote for all black people. David oyelowo plays king and he was absolutely amazing in this film. He was so good that I truly believed that king was on the screen in front of my eyes and that is huge credit to this incredibly talented actor. Tom Wilkinson plays the president and he also did a great job in this film. I actually felt like his character had development and was an interesting character. Tim Roth plays a villain in this film and he did a good job in coming across as a bad guy. Everybody around the civil rights movement was great as well and connected with MLK. The story had a great development with mlk and how he was just a normal guy and that he had problems. Also seeing some bad things in this film really makes you want to root for the movement. However, there are some side plots that aren't developed that much and thus leave you asking a few questions. The script was really good with the drama involved making sense for the time. It is one of those films where the lack of humour works. The style was really good, the brutality shown feels real and it really makes you root for mlk. Overall this is a fantastic film that if your interested in the subject matter is worth a watch.",9,0,1,18 January 2016
Mission: Impossible," A very solid spy thriller
","Mission Impossible has become well known for its theme song and also for this being Tom Cruise's franchise, but this film is a really solid spy thriller and it does a really good job of introducing this franchise. This story starts off when special agent Ethan Hunt ends up with his team all dead on a mission and he is accused of conspiracy against the American government and on the run for his life. Now this really is Tom Cruise's film and he is fantastic as Ethan Hunt and does a really good job of being a serious action star who the audience can relate too which really brings out the best in the film. The supporting cast is pretty poor though really, an exception to that is Jon Voight as Jim Phelps, even though it is a bit of a smaller role he does a great job in the role and alongside Cruise he does a great job. But then to the rest it is not my favourite, the woman they got to play Jim Phelps wife Claire isn't a very good actress and she doesn't do a very good job in the role. Also the guy they got to play the head of the CIA would have been better had he had a bigger role as he wasn't given enough time to establish his character. Jean Reno also plays another fugitive and I didn't really like his character either as he just seemed like a weird add on that wasn't really necessary. The story is a huge plus with loads of twists and turns that make all the characters add to the story and make them seemingly important. The script is okay with Cruise having some really good lines but some of the other characters lines are not that good at all. The style of the film is great with obviously the iconic theme song being great but also the action scenes seemed realistic but also exciting. This is a really good solid film that I hope sees even better in the future.",7,0,0,30 September 2014
La La Land," A fantastic unique loveletter to musicals
","I had heard so much about this film that I knew I had to see it and I have now seen la la land as I really really love this film. The premise of this film sees a jazz pianist fall in love with a failing actress and we see there journey. Ryan gosling plays Sebastian the jazz pianist and he is fantastic in this film, he just has so much charisma in this film and you see him as the coolest guy in any film. He has such a passion for jazz that you want to see him succeed and you buy him as a character. Emma stone plays Mia the failing actress and she is truly great in this film, she is incredibly relatable and like gosling you want to see her succeed in her dreams and you really care about her character. Gosling and stones chemistry is what really carries this movie and I ended up caring about There relationship as the film progresses and develops. However, my one negative in this film is the fact there is a supporting cast in this film that is just there to sing and dance which I thought could have been used in a better way. There is a cameo in this film that I didn't know was coming so I am not going to spoil it in case you have missed it too but it was gratifying. But it does make you wish this cameo was in this film allot more. The story is a great journey of two people that have different passions but you see there relationship develop and you really care about how there relationship develops throughout there movie and how both characters own personal journey takes twists and turns that are great to watch. The script has great dialogue that make these characters charming and relatable to anybody really. But when the drama hits it also feels pretty real and you see the drama play out very well. The style of this film is probably the most unique thing about this film, this is a loveletter to musicals of old and it does it pretty well the songs are memorable and catchy and it does help the main characters characterization. The dance moves are also great and helps make this an easy watch. Overall I liked this movie and then for the next few hours I was thinking about the film and I ended up loving it, so even if you are not a fan of musicals this is worth a watch.",9,3,9,16 January 2017
Woman in Gold," An above average film that has drama
","I was interested in seeing this film because of the talent involved and the subject matter and this is an alright manager. The premise of the film sees a woman and a young lawyer attempt to retrieve a piece of stolen art from the Austrian government. Helen mirren is obviously one of the most iconic actresses ever and she is great in this film. She had allot of depth to her character and you really do care about her character in this film as she truly tries to do whats right. Ryan reynolds was really really good in this film and delivered a very surprising performance. He was funny but he was a complex character that definitely had dramatic qualities to him. Daniel bruhl and katie holmes are both good additions to this film even though there not in the film that much. The story of mirrens battle is interesting and as the film progresses it becomes more emotionally investing to both reynolds character and the audience. However, this film has allot of flashbacks that really just didn't do anything for me and I feel like they were just in there to extend the run time of the film. The script had some good emotional moments and some well placed humour but I do feel like it was missing more power scenes and the flashbacks didn't have very interesting dialogue at all. The style of this film is its biggest weakness, I know this film is based on a true story but the pacing is a big issue. It moves at breakneck speed at the beginning and slows down for the remainder of the film, hardly hitting the high heights that I wanted. Overall this is an above average film that if you're interested in the subject matter then you should see it.",6,2,4,12 January 2016
Reservoir Dogs," A fantastic crime film
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the most iconic directors of all time and with the hateful eight coming up I thought I would watch his first film reservoir dogs. The premise of this film sees six strangers come together to pull off a heist. When it goes wrong the crew suspect that one of them is a police informant. Harvey Keitel plays Mr white and he is great in this film. He plays the wise leader of the group and he is the character you care about the most because he had the most humanity about him. Tom Roth plays Mr orange and his relationship with white is one of the big stories of the film and I really liked the teacher/student dynamic. His character was interesting and you learn allot about him and the others in this film. Michael Madsen plays Mr blonde and he was really good as the crazy member of the group that is willing to do anything to get the job done. Steve buscemi plays Mr pink and he was a different character because he really plays a slimeball and it really worked within the dynamic of the group. The story though is a bit of a mixed bag, I love the dynamic in the group and the first scene in the film really gives you all the information about the characters that you need. However, I do feel like the film spent a bit too much time on the flashbacks and the reveal of this film was actually pretty predictable. The script was fantastic, with the dialogue between the characters feeling real and very witty with allot of drama involved in the film. The style of the film has been criticised for being over violent which I think is ridiculous. All the violence is used in a very good way and the torture scene is probably the best ever. Overall this is one of tarantinos best and should definitely be seen.",9,0,0,29 October 2015
Limitless," A poor overrated movie
","Allot of people have recommended this film to me and I must say I am very disappointed. The premise sees a writer at his lowest take a drug that allows him to use 100% of his brain. Bradley cooper is a great actor and he is pretty good in this film, he brings humanity to his character in certain situations. But his character is written to be so unlikable that you really don't want to root for him. Everybody does a decent job in this film whether it is abbie cornish as coopers girlfriend or robert de niro who does a decent job. The villain was also okay but the only problem is none of these characters have any development and you will not care about anybody by the end of this film. The story has some interesting elements involving coopers evolution with the drug but there is also allot of side stories just forgotten about. The ending also leaves allot to be desired . The script isn't that bad it just leaves allot to be desired as well because there is nothing special about it that makes it stand out. The style of this film is a bit weird with bizarre out of place hallucinations and the pacing is incredibly slow for the film. Overall this is a poor film that I don't think is worth a watch.",3,3,5,4 March 2016
Rocky," A fantastic film that is truly groundbreaking
","In preparation of the upcoming rocky spin off creed I have decided to review the previous rocky movies, so to start with the first film. The premise of this film sees a down on his luck boxer who gets a chance to fight the world champion as the true underdog. Now when I think of Sylvester Stallone I think of the character rocky balboa. He is phenomenal in this film, you see the emotion from his character and he is just so likable that you want to truly get behind him and you really believe in rocky balboa. There is everything you need in this film character wise, a good romantic interest Who has great chemistry with Stallone. There is also a great trainer and manager who really add to the film. The story of this film is so relatable to anybody because it is a complete underdog story. Everything works with this story, its simple but so effective in its execution. The script is alright with some funny and good dramatic dialogue that really works. However, sometimes it doesn't work and it makes the characters a bit less impressive. The style is fantastic, the training montage scene is incredible and one if the most iconic scenes in all of film. The boxing matches really work too and really helps. Overall this was a fantastic groundbreaking film that if your a fan of boxing films must be seen.",9,0,0,16 September 2015
Beauty and the Beast," A great remake that has personality
","With the animated film being one of the most iconic films of all time there was a lot of pressure on this film to be good and I thought it really was. The premise of this film sees a girl who is seemed to be weird by her village because of her books, when she is trapped in an enchanted castle with a a beast. Emma Watson plays belle in this film and she does a decent job, she fit the role with her looks and singing voice. I also thought she was a pretty strong female character that is good for women to see. However, I felt like her character was a little bland and wooden which made her one of the least memorable characters in this film. Dan Stevens plays the beast in this film and I thought he did a great job, I thought his character had a good character arc in the film and I liked his subtle humour that he had in the role. Luke Evans plays Gaston in this film and he was absolutely the perfect person to play this role, he had the look, the voice and the charisma he had oozed on the screen. Josh gadd also had great comedic timing in this film and I loved his chemistry with Evans in this film. Ewan McGregor and ian McKellen play lemuier and cogsworth and they encapsulated the roles perfectly and I loved them in these roles. The story does have some truly emotional moments that makes you care about the majority of characters. However, similar to how I felt about the 2014 Cinderella film this film doesn't really add anything new to its story which makes it an easy watch but doesn't do anything that interesting. The script has some great humour in it that really surprised me and actually had me and the audience laughing quite a lot. The drama also works and you end up buying the development in belle and beasts relationship. The style of this film has some excellent singing sequences that are very familiar but memorable in this film. Overall this is a great remake that hopefully leads to more of these remakes.",8,1,5,22 March 2017
Sicario," A good suspenseful thriller
","I have now finished my Dennis Villeneuve series with sicario, and I liked this film even though I think it is a little bit overrated. The premise of this film sees a FBI agent sent to a new task force to go after the cartels in Mexico. Emily blunt plays the lead in this film and she is great in the role, she is a strong female character but also portrays her vulnerability really well to make you truly care about her character. For the majority of the film you see this situation from her viewpoint and it causes you to root for her even more. The best part of this film has to be the performance of benicio del torro, he is easily the best character in this film. As you see his character develop throughout the film you become more and more interested in his journey during the film. Josh brolin plays the head of the task force in this film and he is a complex character as you try and see where his character is coming from. Victor Garber, Jon bernthal and Daniel kaluuya are also really good in there smaller roles. The story is interesting seeing these different people trying to deal with this crime in different ways some making unique moral decisions. But even though it is my favourite part of the movie the 3rd act is really bizarre as it shifts focus from blunt to del torro and it makes a weird ending. The script has some good dramatic dialogue in it but not a lot that stands out also the humour doesn't really work in this movie when used. The style of the film though is beautiful, the cinematography is terrific making this film a visual marvel to watch. But this film suffers from some real pacing issues that hurt its overall viewing pleasure as it trundles along at times. Overall I liked sicario and I think that if you are a fan of cartel thrillers then this is definitely a film for you.",7,1,2,30 July 2017
Jack Reacher," An above average cop drama
","In preparation for mission impossible rogue nation I thought I would watch the previous collaboration between the director and Tom Cruise. This film was much different to what I expected and I did enjoy it to a certain amount but I do believe it could have been allot better. Now Tom cruise is Jack reacher in this film and even though there was controversy over it I thought Tom cruise was great in this role. He was completely different to what he usually is, he plays a tough cop who doesn't care about anybody and is just around to do his job and nothing more. His character was clearly damaged and was really cool which definitely helped this film. Rosamund pike plays the lawyer that cruise works with and she is good in this film as well, her chemistry with cruise was fantastic and she was a good part of the film. David Oyelowo is in this film and I have been a big fan of this guy for this film and even though his character is pretty underdeveloped he did a decent job. I wasn't a huge fan of Richard Jenkins as the district attorney and don't really think he added anything to the film. Also the villains didn't come across as menacing as they should and it takes away from the film. People thought that the story wasn't going to be too detailed but it really was. It is actually a pretty clever film with allot of good detective and detailed scenes that make this film actually pretty interesting. I just felt that the villains schemes were not fleshed out well enough and the characters in general didn't really get fleshed out as much as I would have wanted. There was some good dialogue between cruise and pike which was really interesting and detailed but there was also some really bad comedic dialogue that took away from the film. The action scenes were great and heavy hitting but there wasn't too many of them. Also there are some really big tone shifts in the film that just confuse you. Overall this is an above average film that definitely has its positives but it also doesn't give me too much hope for mission impossible 5.",6,0,1,17 July 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A good fun space adventure sequel
","One of the most anticipated sequels in history is here in guardians of the galaxy vol 2 and I enjoyed this film, even though I do think this is a pretty disappointing film. The premise of the film sees the team attempting to avoid an ancient race hunting them down, while finding out more about star lords lineage. Chris Pratt is back as Peter quill/star lord In this film and he is truly great in this role, he provides a lot of charisma, humour and especially emotional depth to his character in this film. His character arc is the main plot in this film and he truly made me buy his character and the emotional journey he goes through in the film, while keeping his humour in this film. The rest of the team is back, Zoe saldana is back as gamora and she does a good job in this film, I liked her relationship with her sister nebula in this film and I feel like she did the best job she could even though she is a little underutilised. Dave bautista is back as drax and proves that he is the real deal in this film and proves that he is a future acting star. He nails all the humour that he is given in this role and has a bit of drama with his character but like saldana is a bit underutilised. Rocket raccoon and this time baby Groot are in full flow in this film and I loved both of there characters in this film for humour and drama. I also liked Kurt Russell's addition to the cast and I thought he provided a lot of charm to his performance and dramatic with Peters storyline. But the real show stealer for me in this film has to be Michael rooker's performance as yondu. He is given so much great character development in this film and I loved seeing him progress as the film goes on. He is probably the coolest character in this film and I loved how much better he was treated in this film then the first. The story has a lot of good pairings in it with emotional story arcs as the film develops, as you see the team progress together and apart which was well handled. However, this film is really not cohesive at all, there are to many story arcs in this film to follow and some characters get left behind. Also the character of ayesha and the sovereign are absolutely ridiculous and I hated there role in the story of the film. The script has a lot of humour in it, probably the most any marvel film has ever had and most of it works. But there is way too much humour in this film and at times it feels like a flat out comedy instead of an adventure film. The drama is handled very well in this film and I really liked how it helped develop the characters. The style of the film once again has the bright colourful look that the first film film did and I really liked that along with the action scenes. However, the pacing of the film is a bit all over the place especially with a bit of a lacklustre second act and maybe a little forgetful final confrontation that didn't deliver for me. Overall I liked guardians of the galaxy 2 but I wanted this film to be so much better with its execution, I hope they get a fresh start with the future projects but this is a decent film worth a watch if you liked the first film.",7,2,5,28 April 2017
The Da Vinci Code," An average mystery that has too much in it
","In preparation for inferno this week I have gone back and watched the first film in this trilogy the da vinci code. The film sees a professor go on the hunt for a mystery that could shake Christianity. Tom hanks plays Robert langdon and he is great in this film. You buy him as a professor and he is easily the most interesting character and sometimes is the voice of the audience. Audrey tautou plays sophie and she has great chemistry with hanks in this film, she was a pretty strong female character and worked well alongside hanks. Sir ian mckellen is really good in this film, he is great alongside hanks and tautou and seems to have fun in this film. However, there are quite a few boring characters who are very bland. Paul bettany plays silas the monk after hanks and at first he showed promise but then becomes a generic bad guy that is forgotten about for the majority of the film. Alfred molina is a great actor but in this film he wasn't even needed and actually really slows the film down. The story has some interesting intrigue involved as the film develops. However, there is just too much going on in this film story arc wise which really bogs the film down with some pretty predictable plot twists. The script is very bland with allot of history exposition that could have probably been explained in a better way. The style of the film has some interesting developments in it. But it is a bit slow paced and I think the film is about 10 minutes too long that hurts the ending. Overall this is a pretty average thriller that isn't a must see.",5,0,1,17 October 2016
Rocky III," A good addition to the rocky franchise
","After the first two fantastic Rocky films it was decided that there would be a third film and is a good third film. The premise of the film sees rocky in the high life after winning the title until he is faced with a new young hungry challenger. Sylvester Stallone is back as rocky in this film and wrote and directed this film. He is great in this film, it shows a different side of rocky in this film and he does a great job. The supporting cast is also great, adrians character is good because of how her relationship with rocky develops and it works in this film. Carl weathers is back as apollo creed and this is the best portrayal of the character yet as his relationship with rocky being much better in this film and humanizing. Micky is back and even though he isn't in the film a huge deal he does a great job. This film introduced Mr t as clubber lang and he was a really good villain in this film. The story of the film is decent and the redemption story really works in this film. However, this is a shorter film and it doesn't hit the emotional level that you want it too. The script is alright with some good humour but SD I said the drama sometimes doesn't hit as strongly as you want it too. The style is alright with some decent boxing scenes but it doesn't hit the levels of the previous films. Overall this is a good third film that if your a fan of boxing movies you should see.",7,0,0,1 October 2015
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A good introduction to this universe
","In preparation for the upcoming fantastic beasts and where to find them I have decided that I am finally going to watch the harry potter films starting with this one. The premise sees an 11 year old boy who's parents were wizards invited to a magic school called Hogwarts. Daniel Radcliffe plays harry potter and he gives a truly fantastic kid performance. You see the innocence in his character but you also see the strength he has that make him the interesting character that he is in this film. Rupert grint plays Ron weasley and Emma Watson plays hermione granger as Harry's two best friends and they are both really good in this film as well. They are both fun characters who have good chemistry together and with harry as they go on their journey and it is fun. Robbie Coltrane plays hagrid who gets harry to Hogwarts and is a mentor to our group of wizards and a lovable character. Maggie smith plays one of the teachers and she does a really good job being a good motherly figure to harry. The late Alan Rickman plays snape one of the teachers and gives one of the more interesting performances in the film as he seems to be antagonistic towards harry but he has more to him as a character. The story has a great introduction into the wizard world and a pretty personal story for harry as he tries to get over his parents situation and his introduction to Hogwarts. However, this film is quite long and there are allot of filler in the plot which means it takes too long to get into the interesting plot of the film. The script has some fun dialogue in it that builds the friendship between the characters. However, because if their young age sometimes the drama doesn't come across that well which is a negative for this film. The style has some decent special effects and cgi especially during the quiditch game. However, the film does have some pacing issues and some of the cgi does look pretty dated now. Overall this is a decent film that does a good job in getting you excited for the sequels.",7,0,1,27 July 2016
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A great darker sequel
","The next harry potter film I'm reviewing is the goblet of fire, and I really enjoyed watching this film. The premise sees harry in his fourth year at Hogwarts where he is mysteriously selected for the tri wizard tournament. Daniel Radcliffe is a little older as harry and I thought he did a really good job in this film. You see his character getting a little darker but he also keeps that innocent undertone to his character that makes him pretty relatable. Rupert grint does his best job as Ron in this film because he is given a lot more to do then just be comic relief and he does it well. Emma Watson as hermione is a little annoying in this film but that has been what her character has been like and I think she works well with the other two lead actors. Michael gambon is back as Dumbledore and I really like him as the character, I feel he brings the spectacle to the character but I also actually believe the relationship he has with harry in this film. Newcomer to the franchise Brendan gleeson plays mad eye moody and I though he was the best character in this film. He is very eccentric and unnerving to harry but you sense he wants to help him through the journey. The story has a decent twist too it with the sporting wizard challenges that I did find really interesting. However, this film does try a bit too much and I feel it would have been a bit better with a more tight simple plot and some side plots either expanded or totally forgotten about. The script has allot of great drama in it that really allows you to buy the situation that is going on. The humour is better placed in this film too and feels more natural. The style is allot darker then the previous films and I actually really like this turn and thought it added allot to the film. However, like the other harry potter films I feel like this film has pacing issues and could have done with being a bit shorter then it is. Overall I really enjoyed this film as probably my favourite so far in the franchise.",8,0,1,5 August 2016
Thor," A really good introduction to the god of Thunder
","next I review one of Marvel's riskiest films ever that succeeded. This sees Thor as heir to the throne of Asgard be banished by his father Odin to Earth because of his massive arrogance. As Thor attempts to recover and reclaim his powers on Earth a power struggle commences as his brother Loki attempts to take over. Now Chris Hemsworth was relatively unknown before he was cast as Thor but he was the perfect casting and he truly encapsulates the character of Thor and manages to make this god relatable to humans which is no small feat. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins was a great choice as Odin and he truly brought the fatherly figure into it and shows just how great an actor he is with the dramatic moments he expresses towards both Thor and Loki. Tom Hiddleston has become truly memorable in his role as Loki and it is truly merited as he is a great bad guy and one of the great villains there has been as he was given more to his character then other villains. A couple of the performances though weren't that great, like Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. I think she has been weakening since Star Wars and her love interest with Thor wasn't really established at all during the film and wasn't a great part of the film. Also with an actor of Skellan Skarsgarrd's ability I think his character was a bit of a joke and was slightly underutilised. When the director was brought on some people was wondering why a Shakespeare director was brought in but it is clear with the story that the links are similar with the rise back to power and brotherly narrative in there. However, I did feel that the romance was weak and I didn't buy thor's complete change in this film. The script is great and it really mixes good drama and good comedy which makes this film's dialogue great which could have been the hardest part to do for this film. The style is great and asgard looks great and the amount of cgi was necessary and I wouldn't have changed it. The fight scenes are good and work for this film also even when he isn't fully powered. Overall I think this film is great and it was a huge success for the character of Thor.",8,2,3,11 August 2014
Zombieland," The best zombie film since Shaun of the Dead
","Now this film will get a lot of comparisons to Shaun Of the Dead and I truly believe this film is just as good as that fantastic film was and is the new version of it. This film is based in a zombie apocalypse with Columbus a nerdy but efficient survivor as he goes on a road trip with 3 companions to survive. Now Jesse Eisenberg was great in his role and was perfect casting for the nerdy role, his monologues are great and his delivery of lines is superb. The supporting cast is also fantastic, Woody Harreldson plays his red neck ally and he is great with their chemistry being excellent and his presence being a great thing to see in this film. Also Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin were great as the sister companions and really provided a great dynamic in the film that truly helped. The chemistry between all these guys is superb and it really carries this film and is probably the main reason I love this film so much. The story is not the strong point of the film with it essentially being a road trip film that you will have seen before, however, they do such a good job of it you end up not really caring too much about how basic the story was. The script was superb with the dialogue being utterly superb and it was hilarious from the opening scene to the end scene. The style was great as well with the zombies looking cool and the last 20 mins of the film's style being so awesome and really being a great finale. Overall this is a fantastic film that really shows how good zombie films can be.",9,2,4,1 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A great sequel in this world
","Continuing my task of watching the harry potter films I have now watched the second film the chamber of secrets. The premise of the film sees harry potter return to Hogwarts where bad things start to happen that seem to involve harry. Daniel Radcliffe plays harry again and he does a great job, this is a more personal story for harry and he does a great job selling the emotional journey harry goes through in the film. Rupert grint is back as Ron weasley and he is good in this film you see his relationship with harry develop as they go through the film and you believe him as the lovable friend. Emma Watson plays hermione and she isn't in the film a huge amount but she does a good job and the trio together are fun to watch. Robbie Coltrane plays hagrid and he does a good job even though he isn't in this film as much as the previous he is an important part. Richard Harris gives his final performance as professor Dumbledore and he does a great job in this film as the mentor to harry that he lacked in the first film. Tom felton as Draco malfoy is more important in this film and he is a good antagonist for harry in this film. The story in this film is much darker and more intriguing then the previous. It is sort of a murder mystery that involves the history of magic and I found it pretty fun and interesting to watch. The script has some decent drama in it especially as the film progresses. However, the humour doesn't really feel natural in this film and I didn't find much of it charming or funny. The style has much better cgi in this film and the action scenes are much more fun. However, like the previous film the pacing of this film is pretty slow and it takes it's time to become interesting. Overall this is an improvement on the previous film and is a great fantasy film.",8,0,1,29 July 2016
Die Hard," easily one of the best action films of all time
",When you talk about the 80's action star Stallone and Schwarzenegger get most of the credit but die hard created possibly the most relatable action star ever in Bruce Willis as John mclane. This film sees a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber attack a Christmas party for ransom with new York cop John mclane the only man capable of stopping them. Now I love Bruce Willis in this film and I think that his performance in this film helped shape his career to what it is. Mclane is a bad ass but his anger and one liners make him relatable to us and why we truly want him to win. But what is a good hero without a good villain and Alan richtman as gruber was fantastic and the great foil for our hero mclane. The cop al he communicates with is a great addition too s it gives some good moments between him and Willis. Other performances from Mrs mclane and the police chief were good and got the job done in this film. The story was unique for the time and a great concept that won't be topped by the greatness of this film. The script is superb with Willis and richtman having wonderful lines and really adding to this great action film with the humour. The unique style of violence and Christmas worked really well and it was a great decision for this film. This is one of my favourite films and I always look forward to seeing it.,10,2,3,12 September 2014
American Made," An average thriller that is pretty forgettable
","Tom cruise is still a big star so when I saw the trailer for this film I had some interest in this film. The premise of the film sees a daredevil pilot get offered a job by the CIA and it changes his life forever. As mentioned tom cruise plays the lead in this film and he is pretty great, he adds a lot of charisma to his performance. He adds charm to the role and even though his character isn't the most likable you can't help but root for him because of his performance. Domnall gleeson plays the CIA agent in this film and he also is good in this film. He has a quirky personality in the film and his chemistry with cruise is good when they're on screen together. I also thought the actress who plays cruise in the film was good as well. But I found all the performances involved with the cartel side of the film to be pretty drab and bland and I hated cruises characters brother in law in this film, he annoyed me a lot. The story in this film is crazy to watch and it is interesting to watch this guy have to deal with all these different things all at once. This is also a negative though as there is just so much going on in this film and I felt like some of it was just filler and pretty unnecessary. The script actually has some pretty decent humorous dialogue in it, but I feel the film doesn't go far enough with its dramatic dialogue especially towards the end of the film. The style of the film has a more grainy look about it which I didn't really feel worked very well. But the part I really didn't like was the pacing of the film. The film is less then two hours long but I swear it felt three hours long. This film just drags on a lot and it really hurts the overall quality of the film. Overall this is one of those films that isn't bad but not particularly good either which makes it not really worth watching.",5,10,19,4 September 2017
War of the Worlds," A poor dull invasion film
","In preparation for his upcoming film bridge of spies I thought I would watch Steven Spielbergs war of the world's. The premise of this film sees a guy being put in charge of his kids when an alien invasion starts to happen. Now tom cruise is the lead in this film and he is definitely the best part of this film. You wanted to root for his character and you understood his motivations to protect his kids in this apocalyptic scenario. Dakota fanning played his daughter and I couldn't stand her in this movie, all she did was scream and it became incredibly annoying so I ended up not caring about her. Her brother was even worse, I hated this guy from the very start. He was just so irritating and just a dumb character that I really didn't care about. They run into this crazy guy and he was just a cartoon. The story was garbage, we have no idea why the aliens are invading, it gives no indication on their motivations. Also I didn't care about anybody in this film except for tom cruise which goes against the whole point of the film. The end sucked as well, it was as cliché as you like and it was really abrupt making me feel like 30 minutes of the film was missing. The script just didn't have much weight to it at all. Moat of the drama didn't work and there was no humour at all. The style looks so outdated now, the aliens for the most part looked really bad. There were a few scenes where it looked decent but for the most part it wasn't good. Overall this is a movie that you should skip of Spielbergs.",3,3,10,2 October 2015
Love Actually," a great feel good film
","Now I am not a Rom com fan at all and I thought being made by my mum and younger sister to watch love actually was going to be awful. But to my surprise I came out of it absolutely loving it and thinking it was great. The story starts a month before Christmas and sees 8 different couples go through the journey that is love. Now with all the performers in the film they really share the lead and my goodness is this a legit cast. Big name actors such as Alan Richtman, Colin firth, Hugh Grant, Liam neeson, Bill nighy and Keira knightley are all in this film and they are all great. There isn't one bad performance in this film and that is mainly due to the high calibre of the performers in the film. Now as you can imagine with 8 stories going on the film can be a bit messy and this is true here with just way too many things to focus on and it does hurt the film. However, the majority of the stories are really thought provoking and really teach a lesson about love. The script is fantastic with the dialogue between hilarious and turning this film into mostly a comedy and making it one of the funnier films I have seen. The style is okay but sometimes London can become a bit cliché and overbearing and also this film seemed to have to connect everybody and it did make it a little hard to understand sometimes. I can't believe how good this film is and people who don't think they will like it please see it especially around Xmas time.",8,1,2,27 December 2014
12 Years a Slave," A fantastic truly disturbing film is quite hard to watch
","I have heard great things about 12 years a slave and I have finally seen it and this is a fantastic film. The premise of this film sees the true story of a free black man that is drugged and sold into slavery. Chiwetel ejiofor is our protagonist and he is absolutely amazing in this film, you truly feel sympathy for him in this film and he gives such a powerful performance that you will remember for a long time. Michael fassbender plays one of his slave owners and wow this is one of the most intense performances that I have ever seen, he gives everything to this performance and you truly can't stand him. Lupito nyongo makes her film debut here and she is great here. She is very vulnerable here and you truly want her to survive and get free. The other smaller roles played by benedict cumberbatch, brad pitt and Paul giamatti are all really good and they allow allot of credibility and there performances are impactful. The story is incredibly uncomfortable to see this guy get put through hell. This film really makes you question humanity and its past and does a great job in making you feel lots of sympathy for the slaves in this film. The script has allot of disturbing dialogue in it that add to the tension. There is like no humour but that is necessary for this film because of it's intense subject matter. The style of this film is that this film is willing to show anything no matter how disturbing and real it feels. However, the style of the film is where my one negative for this film comes and that by seeing the title you can guess that this film takes place over a few years but it just never felt like it, it hurt the emotional weight a bit as the time span was poorly shown. Overall this is one of the most important films I have ever seen and you should see it at least once even though it is not an easy watch.",9,0,2,22 October 2016
Sausage Party," A great raunchy comedy that Is truly unique
","This film is probably the most talked about film in the world right now and I have finally seen sausage party and this film is very funny indeed. The premise of this film sees food in a supermarket as they prepare to be bought and taken to their great future with them unaware of there dark future. All the characters in this film are fantastically funny that really make this film great. Seth then, Kristen wigg, Jonah hill, bill hader and Edward Norton all provide voicework in this film and they are all great. There are some pretty offensive characters in this film but I you can accept it then it I completely hilarious. The story provides really funny moments as the food attempt to come to grips that they are possibly destined to be eaten. However, this film's story is a little messy at times and jumps over a few different locations that I believed not necessarily was for the best. The script is really funny and I was laughing throughout with the jokes working. Also the fun drama in the film works for this fun film. The style of this film is a cheap fun animation that gives this film really nice charm to it. Also this film Is pretty offensive to major religions and if you are easily offended then you shouldn't see this film but I found it pretty funny. This film about half way through loses some of the fun to it and it actually hurts the pacing of the film as more characters are introduced. Overall this is a great comedy that if you have any interest in you should see.",8,6,11,7 September 2016
Joker," A Fantastic Character Study of The Joker
","This has been a much talked about film and for me being a huge fan of The Joker I had so much interest in this fim and it has been controversial but I really loved it. The premise of the film sees a man with mental issues dealing with his life as he becomes more and more twisted and morphs into the supervillain The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck in this film and I mean he has to be the favourite for the oscar next year. You feel every emotion watching this character and you are mesmerized when you watch his character on screen, I don't want to say too much about his character in this film as you should experience it without knowing too much. The question will become who was the better Joker Joaquin Phoenix or Heath Ledger and I have to be honest they are so different that I am so happy we have both performances to appreciate. Robert De Niro plays a show host in this film and it was just really nice to see De Niro give a great performance and seem like he actually cared about his role . I thought the guy the played Thomas Wayne also did a really good job in his smaller role and I felt he fit the character very well. however, my one critique for the film is some of the female supporting characters such as his mother and Zazzie Beetz characters aren't given the depth that the other characters have in the film and that was slightly dissapointing. The story is great seeing this individual go through their life and develop into this character, I can't say much about the story as you need to experience it for itself and make your own assessment. The script is fantastic, a brilliant mix of humour and drama that makes this an incredibly interesting film with a great lead performance. The style makes this film seem based in a somewhat reality and that makes it even more terrifying, yest there are some uncomfortable scenes but thye feel appropriate for the film that it being shown. Overall this is a truly fantastic character film that if you are a fan of character development then this is a film for you.",9,4,6,11 October 2019
Man on Fire," a fantastic film that is surprisingly unique
","I am a big fan of Denzel Washington so I decided to watch this film and I must say it is fantastic. The premise of this film sees denzels character hired to protect a family particularly a young girl. So when she is kidnapped he promises to kill every person responsible and save the girl from death. Now Denzel is great in the role and he combines the mix of drama and action really well and his performance in this film is really really good with special emotional layers to his character. The supporting cast is also really good with this probably being my favourite Dakota fanning performance ever. Her and denzels chemistry is fantastic and really carries the first half of this film which makes the second half more impactfull. The mum and dad of fanning were both really good also with the mum being an emotion filled character and the dad a layered character. Even though he isn't in the film that much Christopher walken was great in the film and showed his real acting chops and his chemistry with Washington was good. The story was multi layered and even though the premise is similar to other films this one has its unique angle. The story isn't just an action story but it sees a man who goes through a journey of redemption and gets attached to this kid and the end of the film is tear worthy. The script is great too with a really good mix of comedy and drama dialogue that makes these characters feel interesting and multi layered. The style is a bit of a mixed bag I did think some of the stylistic choices worked for the Mexico style. However, not all of it works and sometimes it takes the grit off the film and that is a big disappointment for the film in my opinion. Overall I love this film it is fantastic and every Denzel Washington fan should see it.",9,6,7,9 January 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," A fantastic action film that came as a surprise.
","Now I have heard allot of good things about this film and now that I have finally seen it I must saw that this is a fantastic action film. The premise of this film sees a US army spokesman forced onto the frontlines to fight a war against aliens, when he dies in battle he starts the day over again and with his team tries to stop the war. Now Tom cruise is a great action star especially in the mission impossible franchise but when I saw the trailer for this film I thought it would be similar to oblivion which I didn't like that much. But he was great in this film, it was a different role to his usual and it was refreshing to see. Emily blunt was great in this film and it truly highlighted why she is such a good actress. Her character was interesting and unique but also a great action star that was really enjoyable to watch. Her chemistry with cruise was great and was one of the best aspects of the film. Bill Paxton plays the drill sergeant and he was good even though you have seen him in this role before. I do wish though that there had been an interesting alien character for the team to go through if that had happened then this film could have got a full 10. The story was really interesting with the time loop really allowing the film to make interesting character development and great deaths over again. The script was surprisingly great as well with allot of comedy involved which isn't completely necessary but it was a great addition to the film. The style was also great with all the action being great and being worthy of a true summer action flick. Overall this is a fantastic action film worth seeing.",9,1,4,16 March 2015
Whiplash," an epic dramatic tale that may go down as one of the best ever.
","I have finally had a chance to see whiplash and not only is this my favourite film of 2015 so far but this may be one of my favourite films of all time. The premise sees a young drummer trying to succeed in music school until he meets a teacher who has an extreme method to get the best out of his students. I have seen miles teller in a few things and I have always thought he was decent but I never knew he had this dramatic performance in him. He is utterly fantastic in this film and he is ridiculously relatable because we have all wanted something so bad in our life that we will do anything to get it and this is how he feels in this film and you totally believe everything about his character. Now there is only one other character that matters and it is the breathtaking performance by JK Simmons, he is a complete douche but part of me understands why he is so extreme. He is trying to get the best out of his students and he truly believes that the only way to do that is to be this extreme, also his and tellers chemistry is off the charts and phenomenal. The story is intense, inspirational and emotional, forget that it is music this story represents how much you want something and how much you are willing to sacrifice to get it. The clashes between the two is as intense as anything and you really believe these characters motivations. The end of this film is also perfect for what this film was going for. The script is fantastic everything that teller and Simmons says makes you believe their characters and feel like they are real people that you either want to love or hate. The style is fantastic because it really needed a physical and psychological style to make this film as dramatic as possible and it definitely succeeded in that department. Overall this is a completely epic film that must be seen.",10,1,3,20 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A fantastic film that proves just how good scorsese really is
","This film had a lot of controversy surrounding it which in my opinion is the only reason that Leonardo Di Caprio wasn't a legit contender for the Oscar because this is a superb performance in a fantastic film. This film documents the life of Jordan Belford a silver tongued devil who runs wall street while getting tied into a lot of shady activities. Now as I said Di Caprio as Belford was fantastic he totally fit the role perfectly as when he is delivering speeches you are tied onto any word he says and it keeps you energised. This is his show and he absolutely kills it, with this being his best performance to date. The supporting cast is also really good with Jonah Hill being awesome throughout and adding a lot of great comedic timing, plus his and Di Caprio's chemistry is great as well. Also for the short amount of time he is in the film Matthew McConaughey is awesome and steals the show as Belford's mentor at the beginning of the film. The girl that is Di Caprio's love interest is a really good actor and did a really good job plus she is stunning to look at. The FBI agent in the film also does a good job but just like McConaughey wasn't really used a lot and I wish that was used a bit more. The story is excellent as we see the rise of this guy through Wall Street and it is awesome to see his lavish lifestyle grow as the movie progresses. This is also one of the best scripts ever as the dialogue is just so snappy and good also the monologue's by Di Caprio really add to the film and really carry the films. The style of the film is big and lavish and over the top but it works for the most part except when it just goes slightly overboard with the nudity, I mean I am fine with nudity I just think it sometimes goes too far with it. Overall the 3 hours fly by and it never slows down and I love this film.",9,1,2,31 October 2014
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A fantastic true sequel to die hard
","This is the first time I have seen this film and I gotta say that I love this film and feel its the true sequel to the first film. The premise of this film sees John mclaine going around new york in search for a terrorist who is out for revenge. Bruce Willis most famous role is definitely john mclaine and he is fantastic in this film. He is so relatable in this film and even though he isn't perfect you are rooting for him because you know he is a good cop. He is really funny in this film too which helps his character. Samuel l Jackson plays his partner Zeus and he is great in this film. He is a hilarious character and his chemistry with Bruce Willis is brilliant in this film. Jeremy irons plays the villain in this film and there is a story reason for his inclusion. He was a great villain and a very cerebreal villain that really delivered in this film. The cop characters were also good in this film. The story was good, for the first time in did hard the film isn't locked down in one location and it always keeps the audience on the move. However, I felt the ending was pretty lacklustre and was the only real negative with the film. The script was great with allot of really funny and clever dialogue which helps flesh out the characters. The style of the action scenes is great and really works. It is the most violent die hard film and it works in this film. Overall this is a fantastic action film that you should definitely see.",9,1,2,3 October 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," A average satirical film
","The cast of this film is what drew me to see hail Caesar and now I have seen it this film is very disappointing. The premise of the film sees a film producer trying to locate his top actor who has been kidnapped. Josh brolin plays Eddie mannix the producer and he is great in the film. He was the main character and had the main attention which allowed him to really add depth to his character that this film lacked otherwise. George clooney was good in this film and did the best he could with what he was given as the snooty actor. I also liked the kid who played Hobie Doyle and thought he was a pretty fun character. However, the problem is that there are too many characters that are pointless and waisted especially because of the actors. Scarlett Johansson, Jonah hill, Channing Tatum and Ralph Fiennes are all wasted and underutilised. The story has absolutely no depth to it, unfortunately there are allot of side plots that really don't matter in this film that bog it down. The script has a few funny moments and some well done drama but overall it fails to hit the levels that should be expected from all these talented people. The style is extravagant and over the top and for the most part it does work but most of the over the top parts are pointless and don't add anything to the story or characters. Overall this is a pretty average film that is not really worth a watch.",5,0,2,23 March 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A Great funny comedy
","This I must say is one loved film that people believe is one of the best comedies ever and are quoting to this very day, now I see it as a very good comedy with some excellent chemistry. The Story is that Anchorman Ron Burgundy and his team are a successful news show until the execs decide a female is needed among the group and then the shenanigans begin. Now this film's best part is the chemistry between all the performers every body rightly gives Will Ferrell huge credit for his portrayal as Ron Burgundy but the rest of the cast is also superb with actors like Paul Rudd and Steve Carrel showing great comedic timing and making this film one of the funniest hour and a halves your going to have with a movie. This is Will Ferrell's best performance and his best film possibly however, there are some negatives. At least in my opinion this film lacked a laugh out load moment that I look at with comedy there was a lot of small to medium size laughs but no huge laughs, also the story is pretty weak which I guess works for this film but still is a weakness. However, there is some great laughs, great chemistry and also great small roles for people like Vince Vaughan, Jack Black and Ben Stiller which are all really funny. Anchorman is a funny film that should be seen.",8,0,1,6 May 2014
The Wrestler," Fantastic story with a great lead
","I have to admit I may be a bit bias towards this film because I have watched pro wrestling most of my entire life so I would most definitely see this as an awesome film no matter what. However, this film is the film that has reinvented Mickey Rourke and made him a star again. The story of this film follows Rourke as an ageing wrestler who can't wrestle anymore and how he has to deal with his life. Now this film is all about one man and one performance and Rourke is absolutely superb in this film with his performance being the core that this film relies on and he is believable in all the situations that he is put in. The wrestling scenes are incredibly cool and I very much like the way the camera makes you feel like you are with Rourke the whole time as he goes on this journey. There is only a few negatives with the fact the film slows down quite a bit and also in my opinion the ending is quite abrupt with a few questions being unanswered but the longer I think about it I like the ending. So if you are a wrestling film then this film is a must see and if you are a Mickey Rourke fan this film is also a must see.",9,0,0,22 March 2014
Kong: Skull Island," An average monster film
","So after the decent Godzilla film in 2014 this is the second film in this monster universe and unfortunately this film just doesn't hit the high levels I wanted even though there is good stuff in this film. The premise of this film is set in the 1970's as a team of military personal and scientists go to a mysterious island where they encounter creatures and Kong. Tom hiddelston plays the main hero in this film and unfortunately I found him very bland and dull in this film. I feel maybe he was miscast in the role but mainly it was just the fact that his character had no depth and was very wooden. However, the character of Kong is awesome in this film, unlike Godzilla Kong is given plenty of screen time in this film and I thought he was possibly the most interesting character in this film. Samuel l Jackson plays the military commander in this film and he is great in this film, he has a legitimate reason for going against Kong and you buy him as he develops throughout the film with his men. John Goodman plays the head scientist in this film and I liked him in his role, I thought his dynamic with Jackson in the film was good even though I maybe would have liked to have seen a bit more of him. John c Reilly plays a man who has been on the island longer then the rest and I actually liked his character. I was worried that his added humour would go against the film but I thought he had the best lines and I ended up caring about his character. Brie Larson plays a photographer in this film that goes along for the journey and similar to hiddleston that I found her pretty boring and bland in the role. The story in this film has some nice personal moments especially involving the soldiers and morality. But it is very by the numbers and unfortunately everything to do with Kong is very similar to what they did with Godzilla and it just comes across as repetitive and not unique for his character. The script in this film is just pretty awful, the humour in this film comes across as incredibly forced except for some of Reilly's lines. Also the drama never really hits the levels that it should. The style of this film has some brilliant action scenes, seeing Kong throw down is awesome to see and you get quite a bit of it in this film that I was highly entertained by. However, this film has some tone issues, it is highly inconsistent moving from dramatic to humorous without any segway really which was jarring. Overall this is an average film that doesn't really do Kong justice.",5,2,5,13 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A fantastic film that marks the end of Middle Earth in the right way
","Now the original Lord of the Rings trilogy is easily one of my favourite trilogy's of all time and even though the Hobbit trilogy is a step down I have thoroughly enjoyed it and this film is a fantastic conclusion to Peter Jackson's Middle Earth films. The premise of this film sees the Five armies of Middle Earth amassing on Erebor for their own reasons that creates an epic middle earth war. Now Martin Freeman is once again fantastic as young Bilbo Baggins with his performance being really likable and the most relatable protagonist in these films and his character is so likable it is unreal. The supporting cast is all fantastic with Ian Mckellen reprising his role as Gandalf The Grey and once again he is awesome and such a wise character that I love seeing him in action in all these films. The performance of the film though is definitely Richard Armitage as Thoran and his character really has great character development and his character arc is probably the most interesting of any character in this film and helps drive this film to another level. Another superb performance was Luke Evans as Bard and he really steps up in this film and his character becomes more important even though I thought he was forgotten about towards the end. There are also some other great cameos from past characters such as Legolas, Elrond and especially Saruman. The story involving Thoran's transformation is really interesting and seeing the different races fight is interesting. However, I do think this film has a lot of action and a bit less story to it that didn't help in this film. I also thought this film could have taken some different directions with some of the characters that would have helped the overall feel of the film. The script is great with all the dialogue feeling real and the emotion helping make this film feel more epic then it would have been. The style is just like the other middle Earth films and is just epic with the great visuals and also the great scores for the film. Overall this is a fantastic send off for this franchise and I really think if you have seen the others then go see this film.",9,7,15,17 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the best of the prequels but still not star wars levels
","There are a lot of people who hate these star wars prequels , however I do not hate this film at all I actually quite like it. This film starts with the clone wars still continuing as obi wan Kenobi an Anakin Skywalker doing there best to end the clone wars until a evil force splits them apart. This film doesn't have the best acting in it as Natalie Portman continues her poor performances in the prequels and the lead Hayden Christensen is serviceable but definitely could have been better, the best performances are by ewan McGregor as obi wan and Ian mcdirmid as chancellor/emperor Palpatine with these two providing the most intriguing part of the film. This is definitely the best structured film out of the prequels but there are still some lull in the film in parts and the script is not the best ever. However, this film is a good climax to an otherwise disappointing prequel trilogy.",7,0,1,12 May 2014
Shooter," An above average action film
","When it comes to action films Antoine fuqua is a pretty safe bet as a director and this film is pretty solid addition to his collection even though it does have problems. The premise of the film sees a retired sniper bought in by the government to try and prevent the assassination of the president. Until he is framed for the shot taken and ends up on the run. Now at first I wasn't sure if I was going to buy mark wahlberg as this deadly sniper but as the film progressed I started to like him more. He started to gain a bit of a personality and was damaged a bit showing his vulnerability. Michael Peña was also really good in this film, he is the cop hunting down wahlberg and he brings his usual enthusiasm to the role but a bit more modestly which I really liked. Kate Mara was okay in the film but I felt like her character didn't really have anything to do in the film and could have been completely written out of the film. Danby glover was completely underutilized in this film which ends up making it more difficult to get invested in the story. I like the revenge aspects of the story and when done I think they were done pretty well. But this film just got a little bit too convoluted for its own good and didn't do enough with its character to make you care enough. The script was okay with some good dialogue but sometimes it becomes wooden and boring with a bit of a lack of humour in there as well. The action scenes involving just simple sniping and stealth were really good. However, at some points there are literally choppers involved and it just becomes unbelievable and ridiculous. Overall this film is alright but there were simple things that could have been done to make it better.",6,0,0,25 August 2015
Inception," a film that just makes you go wow
","I have heard for years just how good this film and boy isn't that true, I think this may be one of my favourite ever films. This films premise sees a man capable of stealing ideas from peoples subconscious while there dreaming. A man makes him attempt to plant an idea into a person's subconscious via dreaming, this is called an inception. Now Leonardo DiCaprio is becoming one of my favourite actors around and he is great in this film. He is the character with the most back story and even though he is a flawed character with faults he feels relatable and you feel sorry for him because of his situation. This is one of the best casts of all time as well and the quality of the supporting cast proves it. Ellen page is an architect of the dreams they are incepting and she is well developed with her relationship with DiCaprio being the forefront of the film. Ken wantanabe is the business man that gets DiCaprio to do the inception and he fit the role really well and I can't imagine anybody else in the role. Joseph Gordon levitt is a great actor and this film is no different, his action scenes were breathtaking and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Tom hardy was probably my favourite performance in the film his action scenes were great too but he was also suave and cool and his character was great. Marion Cottillard and cillian Murphy are great in the film but it's best you don't know too much about their characters going into the film. The story could have been ridiculously confusing but what I liked was that they explained everything really well for us the audience so we understood why they were doing things or what they were doing. Also the ending has been spoke about allot and all I am going to be is that it is up to your interpretation. The script is great with some well placed humour mixed with the dramatic moments in the film. Once again I loved all the dialogue that made the concept of the film easier to understand it just makes this film so much more enjoyable. The style is one of the best ever with every action scene really working and it being so hard hitting. Also Hans zimmer's theme was great with the score really encapsulating what the film was. Overall I love this film and it will probably go down as one of my all time favourites.",10,2,5,16 January 2015
Murder on the Orient Express," A decent mysterious film
","After seeing the trailer for this film I actually had some anticipation for this film and after seeing it I enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees a group of people being investigated on a train after a mysterious murder. Kenneth branagh plays famous detective hercule poirot and he is fantastic in this film. He nails the accent and it is so entertaining watching this charismatic performance from him. He also nailed the brilliance of the character and made his discoveries seem pretty genuine. There is a huge supporting cast in this film so I will just talk about the main ones, daisy ridley plays a governess in the film and she is really good. Sometimes she is a little wooden but she delivers a charming character with some interesting features about her. Johnny Depp plays an American gangster in the film and he does a good job, he isn't his usual cartoony self here and I liked him in this more serious role. Something similar could be said about josh gadd who is really developing into a great all round actor. Michelle pfiefer is in this film and she delivers a good charming performance that makes her an interesting character in the film. Willem Dafoe and judi Dench also do good jobs in there smaller roles. The story is interesting as you are following the breadcrumbs with branagh as he attempts to solve this mystery. However, this film is the definition of the journey being better then the finish line as I wasn't a big fan of the end reveal in the film. It just felt cheap and the easy way out that didn't really give me a sense of satisfaction. The script has some decent humour and drama in it, but it also has some over the top dialogue that took me out of the moment, also this film is guilty of exposition dialogue on a few different occasions. The style of the film is very lavish, which works and seeing the different interrogations made this film feel interesting if a bit repetitive. It felt like a very linear by the numbers film which does overall hurt the film. Overall I enjoyed this film but it isn't a truly memorable experience.",7,1,8,7 November 2017
Defiance," A good realistic war film
","Before watching this film all I knew was that it was a world war 2 film with Daniel Craig and Liv Schreiber in it and I was interested and I must say it was an enjoyable experience. This is the true story of two Jewish brothers attempting to survive from the Nazis while building a working civilization for the other refugees around them. Now the co-leads of Craig and Schreiber are both great and I truly believed in their performances and they were definitely the best parts of the film. However, the same cannot be said about the other characters in the film there isn't a true villain and all the love interests and allies are lacklustre and fail to impress among two great performances. Another performance is that of the story which is gripping as these people are relatable as we have all heard stories about the Jews in World war 2 and we can only imagine how it could have felt and with the setting the story is good throughout. The script is not the best as because of the accents being put on it is sometimes hard to understand some people which can hurt the viewing. The style is really good and when the battles take place they are pretty cool with a realistic gritty approach to them. However, a big negative is that the ending is so sudden and it just ends with you wanting more then what you got which leaves this is a good solid film but not an all time great like Schindlers list.",7,1,2,24 June 2014
Sherlock Holmes," A fantastic portrayal of Holmes
","I must admit I don't know lots about the character of Sherlock Holmes in the books I just know the basics and as an unbiased fan I can say that I really enjoy this film. The premise sees Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson bought onto a case to capture the undead Lord Blackwood. Now Robert Downey Jr rediscovered his career with his portrayal of Tony stark in the iron man/Avengers movies but I think his performance as Sherlock Holmes is really underrated. He is really good in this role, he has the scruffy grit that a mad scientist like Holmes would have but he also has the charming nature that would make him a likable ladies man that you can root for, also I know people think this isn't a true depiction of the character but I thought he was great in this film. Also great is Jude law as Watson, he was a great choice to play Watson because he has the British suave to pull off the character and his chemistry with Downey is great. Rachel mcadams plays Holmes love interest and she is really good in the film, she was a strong female character that easily holds her own alongside Downey and law. Mark strong plays the villain Blackwood and even though you barely know anything about his character or his motivations strong does a good job as he seems to do in most things he is in. The story is where the film falls down a little, I enjoy the relationship between Watson and Holmes and the romance going on but sometimes this film gets a bit too convoluted and villains aren't given too much motivation. I also feel like this film had a little bit to much sequel baiting in it that felt like it wasn't focused enough on its current story. The script is great with all the witty dialogue hitting its mark and the comedy working the majority of the time. It does sometimes get a bit fast paced but if you pay close attention you'll be fine. The style of the film is great, the fight scenes are all done really well with a good use of slow mo. The setting was also great and made you feel integrated into the world of Sherlock Holmes. Overall this is a fantastic film that If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes you should definitely see.",9,0,2,29 July 2015
Finding Dory," A great sequel
","I love finding nemo, it's one of my.favourite animated film's of all time. But I wasn't too excited for finding dory and thought it was a little unnecessary but I am happy to say that this is a great film. The premise of this film sees dory remember she has a family and goes on a mission with Marlon and nemo to find her parents. Ellen DeGeneres plays dory and is fantastic in this film. Her character is incredibly lovable and you really want to see her succeed in finding her parents. But she also has allot of heart and emotion as you see her deal with her short term memory loss. Marlon and nemo are back in this film and they add a really nice dynamic, Marlon and dory have a great relationship that is more developed from the first film. I liked all the new characters, the octopus hank and dory's relationship and chemistry is really good and fun to watch throughout the film. All the supporting characters are great especially a pair of sea lions played by idris Elba and Dominic west who just had me laughing the entire time. The story has similar beats to finding nemo but It develops well. You see a great journey of character development with dory and a very different one then the first film. You also see a different location which allows different types of characters to be fun additions to the story. There are good flashbacks as well that add further depth to this film. The script has great drama in it that makes you truly makes you care about dory and her situation. The humour is really funny at times in this film its just not everything hits and there are some times where the humour isn't that funny. The style of this film is great just like finding nemo it provides a beautiful ocean littered with fun characters. However, this film does get a bit too ridiculous in some of its stylistic decisions that took me out of the movie. Overall I really enjoyed this film and if you like finding nemo you should like this movie.",8,1,7,3 August 2016
Arrival," A great interesting sci fi
","This film has been getting rave reviews everywhere I have seen and i have now seen arrival and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of the film sees an expert on languages recruited by the us army to possibly communicate with an alien threat. Amy Adams plays Louise the expert on languages in this film and she is fantastic in this film. She is easily the most interesting character in this film and the character that you care about the most. She is a pretty tragic character and you really feel sympathy for her as the film progresses but she is a strong character as well. Jeremy renner is really good in this film and adds allot to his character that just makes him a likable guy that works very well with adams in this film. Forest whitaker is good in this film as the army colonel, he is a fair character that adds a sense of realism to the film. This Is also the same for all the characters in the bunker and from the other nations that add to this film. The story has a really interesting take on the typical alien invasion that ha me surprised and really interested. There's a twist towards the end that gave This film a real uniqueness to it that I really liked. However, the film ha very little resolution involving the aliens and I found myself with more questions then answers at the end of the film. The script was great it has some great dramatic moments and dialogue in it that makes you care about the characters. Also the film has a dry sense of humour that does work especially for renners character. The style of the film is absolutely gorgeous, this film has the best cinematography of any film This year. But this film has incredibly slow pacing. At times it does work because it gives it's characters more time to develop but it does make this film seem longer then it actually is and drags. Overall this is a really good film that is definitely worth seeing.",8,4,12,11 November 2016
Parasite," An Epic Truly Special Film
","This is a film that has been in the news lately as it picked up 4 Oscars including Best Director & Best Picture which is huge for a non english speaking film. I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that.
Main Character
Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo-Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film, you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn't quite know what to do. He is likeable but you aren't sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout.
Supporting Characters
Everybody gives a superb performance in the film, I won't go through everybody's names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film. These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren't exactly sure who exactly to root for. The one actor I will mention is Kang-Ho Song as the Father of the poor family, he is truly brilliant in this film, he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film.
Story
The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn't exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line. I don't want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you. Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on.
Script
The script even though in Korean is brilliant, this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it, I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional. The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching.
Style
First of all lets mention that obviously this film has subtitles, this should not be something to worry about as it is fine and the film is so strong that it doesn't matter. Okay this film has a bit of everything in a stylistic way, it looks great and has bits of comedy, thriller, drama & horror, it is a perfect blend that keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited to see what comes next.
Overall
Overall, this is one of the best films I have seen in the last few years, it just has a bit of everything to it and was well worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars. If you are put off by foreign films and reading subtitles, don't be as this is a truly special film that has to be seen to truly appreciate just how good it really is.",10,6,11,14 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A fantastic film that looks at the film industry in a nutshell
","I have been looking forward to seeing this film for a while because of how good I had heard it was and it is a fantastic film. This film sees a washed up actor deciding to direct and star in a Broadway play to try to prove he is a real actor after having success as a famous comic book character. Now I really like Michael keaton ever since seeing him in the first Batman film and this is easily his best performance ever. His character feels like it is just Michael keaton pulling from real life to make this dark interesting character who represents a part of the film industry. The supporting cast are also great, Edward Norton plays a cocky actor who kind of represents the other side of the film industry and he is great in the role and his chemistry with keaton is great. Emma stone plays keatons daughter and she is great in the film because of she really creates a damaged character that has real problems with her father that we can understand. Zach galifanakis plays his best friend and he brings allot of humour to the role but also sometimes some seriousness that made him a great addition to this film. The story is great it truly deals with the problems with the film industry and how these blockbusters can affect an actors reputation. I love the way they portrayed this and makes this film really interesting and great social commentary. The script was great and combined humour and drama really well with all the dialogue working and making these characters feel really relatable. The style of this film is incredibly unique as from the beginning the film is made to look like one shot and it is great, it makes you feel like you are actually there with the characters and dealing with the problems with them. However, this film does have some pacing issues and it does hurt this film. Overall this is a fantastic film that I really think you should see.",9,1,6,13 February 2015
The Big Short," A good interesting film
","This film has had allot of praise recently and I liked it but I do think its a bit overrated. The premise of this film is set before the economical collapse as a bunch of misfits manage to predict this collapse. Steve carrell is the main guy in this film and and he has developed into a really good dramatic actor. His character is flawed but you are behind him and understand him as he tries to get his point across. Christian bale is amazing in this film he absolutely owns the screen. His character is really interesting and unique which for me made him the best character in this film. Ryan gosling is probably the most charismatic character in this film and also the funniest. Brad pitt easily has the most emotional scene in the whole film and when he is on screen he does a great job. The story has a good emotional core to it, especially towards the end of the film. However, I felt a bit robbed because of the fact that most of the characters don't even interact with each other. The script has some good humour and drama in it but it does have allot of exposition that just goes too far in trying to explain the terminology being used. The style has some interesting techniques used that work but end up getting overused. It becomes a bit too comedic and wordy at times. Overall this is a good film that if you're interested it is worth seeing.",7,0,1,27 January 2016
Prometheus," An average sci fi horror that isn't really an alien prequel
","So we are here there last alien film I have to watch before seeing alien covenant this weekend, Prometheus, I actually found this film pretty disappointing. The premise of the film sees a group of scientists go on an expedition to track down the possible creators of humanity. Noomi rapace plays Elizabeth shaw in this film and I thought she did an alright job in this film, in the second half of the film delivering a decent dramatic performance and showing some good physicality to her performance. However, for the first hour of the film I found her character incredibly boring and hard to care about because there really isn't anything special about her characters. Michael fassbender plays the android David in this film and he gives a truly fantastic performance in this film. He is so unique and as you watch him throughout the film you become more and more interested in his characters motivations and actions. Idris Elba plays the captain of the ship in this film and he was awesome in this film. He is just such a likable character an I found him incredibly entertaining to watch. However, I found charlize Theron's character to be incredibly bland. She looks great, but she just sounds very monotone and dull that doesn't help you when you watch her in this film. Also the rest of the characters just aren't given anything to work with and it legitimately feels like they are just there to add cannon fodder to the film. The story has a definite slow pace in its execution but as it progress and more reveals are made I got more interested in this film. But as you will hear for a lot of this review I found the first half of the stories exploration boring and just not very interesting at all until a certain point in the film. The script has some pretty decent dramatic dialogue, especially towards the end of the movie that helped me buy the stakes of the situations the crew were in. However, I really do believe this film could have done with better banter and realistic dialogue between the crew as it never really seems any of them get along too well. The style of this film has some decent action scenes towards the end of the film that I will admit to being interested in. But as mentioned the pacing of the film is pretty poor and this film could have really done with a better first hour. Overall this is an average sci fi, but when you consider it is in the alien universe it should have been so much better then it was.",5,1,2,9 May 2017
Wonder Woman," A great important comic book movie
","There was so much riding on this film and I was really excited for wonder woman and I can happily say that this is a great film that I really enjoyed. The premise of this film set in ww1 as it sees an amazonian princess go on a mission with an American pilot to try and stop the war. Gal gadot made her debut as wonder woman in dawn of justice but this is her solo movie now and she does a truly great job. She sells the physicality of the role and she did a really good job in the action scenes, but I was truly surprised by the humour and humanity that she really bought to the role. Chris pine plays Steve Trevor in this film and I thought he was fantastic in the role, he had likability, charisma and a great chemistry with gadot, i enjoyed watching their relationship develop and his performance was so enjoyable. However, I gotta be honest the rest of the cast doesn't really add anything to this film especially when it comes to the villains and it does bring this film down. The story has a great fish out of water coming of age story for Diana and I truly bought it. I loved her development in this film and how her development with Steve Trevor really drew me into the story and seeing how Diana really develops in this world of man. The script was a really surprise as I found this film pretty funny at times, especially with the great drama used as well. It really adds a lot of depth too the main characters and really helps. The style of the film is quite contrasting, there is some great action scenes especially in no man's land that sold women woman as a hero. However, this film really overuses slow-mo that i really found a bit irritating and the final fight does overuse CGI and I found it the least interesting part of the film. Overall though this is a truly great comic book film that in my opinion does need to be watched.",8,6,15,1 June 2017
Back to the Future Part II," A great fun sequel
","After reviewing the first film I felt the need to watch back to the future 2 and review it because its a great film. Right after the events of the first film the doc comes back and takes marty and jennifer to the year 2015 to save their child but in doing so help create an alternate 1985 that they have to save. Michael k fox is back as marty mcfly and he is great in this film, just like in the first film he has this boyish charm about him that makes you want to see him succeed and make things right in his life. Christopher Lloyd is back as doc brown and once again he is a great companion for marty on this adventure. He is smart, funny and has great chemistry with fox just like the first film. This is the film where the character of biff becomes the main villain and he was great in this film, really delivering a fun over the top bad guy performance that definitely boosts the film. The returning lorraine and jennifer characters also do a decent job with what they are given in this film. The story has some interesting ideas in it considering dark alternate timelines which I liked but it does feel like this films story is a bit unfocused. There is allot going on and I felt like some of it was unnecessary and just pandering to fans of the original film. But this film has a fantastic ending that sets up a third film perfectly. The script has some fun dialogue in it that does make you smile and also simplify the science. But I do wish they had gone a little further with the drama to really sell this as a darker film. The style is really good with the future very well designed but the film also has allot of fun action scenes to help. This is a great sequel that if you are a fan of the first film you just must see.",8,5,5,5 March 2016
Taken 2," an average action film that is nowhere near as good as the original
","Now I do love the first taken film and now with the third coming out I have decided to finally watch the second film and I must say I am disappointed as this is a distinctly average film. This film sees Bryan mills returning to deal with the families of his daughters kidnappers who have taken him and his ex wife. Now Liam neeson returns for this film and is good but he isn't really given allot to work with due to the story. The supporting cast is not the best but I think famke Janssen does a good job in the film with her character having much More relevance in this film then the first one. Maggie Grace is back as the daughter and I didn't like her in the first film and with her character more important in this film I once again do not like her. Unlike the first film there is a villain in this film, however, he is a clear idiot and allows mills to destroy his plans so easily. The story goes away from the first taken film and went from a simple premise to a convoluted plot that made no sense and took away from taken's strengths and showed its weaknesses up. The script from the first film and the second film manage to make it feel realistic but this film's dialogue is quite rigid sometimes because of the story. The style is cool sometimes with the car chases and action, but the film is unrealistic to a tee and there is also allot of shaky cam involved. Overall this film is distinctly average and I hope taken 3 is more like the original then this film.",5,1,1,30 December 2014
Straight Outta Compton," A great depiction of this important band
","First of all I'm not the biggest music fan but I was really looking forward to this film because if just how important NWA were to change social interpretations in America. The premise of the film sees the rise of NWA band members eazy e, ice cube and Dr dre and the conflict that they go through. Now the guys who play these three are all completely new and they were all fantastic. The characters were all different and unique, I thought they were all completely unique and different which was impressive. Paul giamatti plays there manager and I really liked his character. He was an interesting character who had allot of depth to him. The story of the groups rise Is fantastic and really great to watch. Also I thought the film portrayed the conflict between the group and the authorities. However, the film goes into more individual stories and yes while it is pretty interesting it felt much slower and more dull until the end of the movie which was great. The script was great with all the dialogue feeling real and true. There was allot of dramatic moment which were fantastic and quite a bit of well done humour. The style was alright, the concerts with the group were amazing and they really were the best part of the movie. However, there aren't too many of them and this film feels a choppy in its pacing as well. Overall I really enjoyed this film and if you're interested you should see it.",8,0,25,3 September 2015
Shrek," An Epic Different Fairy Tale Film
","The other day me and my family rewatched Shrek and it made me realise that this is one of my favourite animated films of all time. The premise of the film sees an Ogre have to go on a quest to rescue a princess from a tower. Mike Myers has become iconic as the voice of Shrek, he is perfect as the loveable ogre. He has so many quick lines that make him such a funny character plus I really like how his character develops as the film progresses. The supporting cast is great too, some would argue that the star of this film is Eddie Murphy as Donkey and he is great in this film. He is just so fast talking and spouting one liners galore that it really works, also his chemistry with Myers is off the chain in this film. Cameron Diaz plays Princess Fiona and she adds an interesting dynamic to the group, she isn't your typical female character and I enjoyed watching her character. John Lithgow plays the villanious Lord Farquad and when on screen he is very entertaining and plays a very fun role in this film. It is also really fun seeing these fairy tell characters in different circumstances. The story is very simple and quite predictable but it is so fun to watch and I really enjoyed the different fairy tale dynamics used in the story and it is a sweet story. The script is great, the humour is really good with some utterly hilarious moments, and some suprisingly emotional moments. The style of the film is great with the large cast of fairy tale characters and the animation moves very smoothly in the film. Overall this is such a great film that should be watched especially as a family.",10,0,0,27 March 2019
X-Men: First Class," A fantastic resurgence of the franchise
","With X-Men apocalypse coming out very soon I thought I would re watch this film and I think it's even better then the previous times I've watched it. The premise is set in the 1960s Where a young Charles Xavier and Erick lensher meet and form the X-Men against world war 3. James mcavoy plays young Xavier in this film and I thought he did a great job in this film. He understands the character and does a great job of bringing out the younger side of him who is intelligent and wise but has more social skills. Michael fassbender plays lensher who is on a quest for vengeance. I love this character because it has so many layers to it he tries to do good but you understand the rage inside of him and how it consumes him at times. Also the chemistry between the two actors is awesome with them really playing well off of each other. Kevin bacon plays the villain Sebastian Shaw and he does a really good job as the over the top bad guy. He does have a bit of depth to him and I really like his relationship with fassbender in the film. Nicholas hoult plays hank mccoy, aka beast in this film and he does a really good job in this film adding allot of depth to the characters and also his development with mystique does work for this film. Rose Byrne plays Moira mctaggert in this film and she is a good companion in this film because she is the human involved so you see most of the actions through her eyes and she does a good job. Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress but I would see her portrayal of raven aka mystique wasn't that interesting. For the most part she is just a partying teenager troubled with the way she looks. I mean it does kind of work when paired with beasts arc but it just wasn't that interesting to me. The story has a great relationship between mcavoy and fassbender where you truly understand both of there points of view as they try to survive as mutants. However, my main problem of this film is Shaw's overall plan. No spoilers but it just doesn't make much sense at all with the information that the film gives you. The script has some great dramatic moments and dialogue between it. It also has little well placed humour that makes the characters feel real. The style of the film is great, with the action scenes being more hard hitting but also a spectacle. Overall this is a fantastic film that should be seen by all comic book fans.",9,0,0,17 May 2016
Fifty Shades of Grey," A horrendous disturbing film
","I have always been curious about this film and I decided to watch it and what a mistake that was. The premise of this film sees an average girl become infatuated with a billionaire playboy with a weird hobby. Now dakota johnson plays Anastasia steele and she is the only real positive in this film because she is okay in this film. She delivers a somewhat decent performance but her character is so boring in this film and has absolutely nothing special about her. Jamie dornan plays Christian grey and this is one of the most boring dislikeable people I have seen in film. These two's chemistry is just never there and it really makes this film painful to watch. The rest of the characters are obsolete and completely pointless to the whole story. The story is just bad, this is a love story but the problem is that there is no romance and no chemistry between the two characters. Also the film ends abruptly with no payoff so you really wonder why you even bothered. The script is awful with the dialogue being cringeworthy and really hard to believe. The style of the film is pretty racy, there is allot of sex in this film but you can find that on the internet for free. Overall this is a film you really don't need to see and you should definitely avoid at all costs.",1,1,2,25 November 2015
The Wolverine," A new fresh take on The Wolverine
","Unlike most people I actually enjoyed the previous X men Origins Wolverine film for what it was, a good prequel to a character that everybody knows and loves. However, there were certain problems with that film and I feel almost the exact same way about this film as I did its predecessor. This Wolverine film, obviously has the return of the fantastic Hugh Jackman in his most iconic role to date and the role he will probably be remembered for his longevity to the character. This Wolverine is set after the events of X men 3 The last stand with Logan leaving the X men and setting out on his own, mainly because of his hallucinations of his ex lover Jean Grey. This film though tries to stay away from the other X men films and focus on Logan with this story being all about The Wolverine. This films setting in Japan is a nice change from the common use of New York in these Comic book films and allows this film to feel unique. This films greatest positives are the scenery, the awesome action sequences and just the fact of once again another fantastic performance from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The main weaknesses are the real forced romance in this film which just feels awkward and unnecessary between Jackman and his Japanese lover. But the main weakness is the antagonists are poor compared to previous villains such as Magneto, Sabertooth and William Stryker. The Villains in this film are not as compelling and are not in my opinion a worthy enemy for Wolverine. But overall this is an exciting new take on the Wolverine character that should be experienced by all x-men fans and Wolverine fans because of it's different take on the lore. (By the way stay after the credits to see a special appearance by some old friends).",8,0,1,14 January 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Good ending to a fantastic trilogy
","This film had a big act to follow after the greatness of The Dark Knight and where it fails to be as good as it the final film in the franchise is a solid film. This film is set 8 years after The Dark Knight with Christian Bale reprising his role as Batman and this film looks more at the character of Bruce Wayne and I did like this idea compared to where they haven't looked into it as much in the other films. The new characters are Joseph Gordon Levitt playing a cop called John Blake, Ann Hathaway as Catwoman and the new main villain being Tom Hardy as Bane. I did like JGL's character and it totally links to the idea of all three of these films that anybody can be a hero. Anne Hathaway is great as Catwoman being the true antihero of the film and plays this well for the film. Tom Hardy as Bane is one intense individual and I believe even though he is no Joker he is still a great villain where it is truly believable that he could physically compete with Batman. Now this is the main problem a lot of this film is just not realistic in a film which is trying to be built on realism which takes away from the film and why this film is slightly the worse of The Dark Knight Trilogy. Nobody truly steals the show in this film and that is good as it allows everybody to have good solid performances, there is some plot twists with a great ending to a great franchise.",8,0,2,19 March 2014
Black Panther," A great new addition to the marvel universe
","After his appearance in Captain America civil war I was so excited to see Black panther reappear and I have now seen this film and i really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees prince t'challa return to the secluded technologically advanced african country of wakanda to become king, when he is challenged with threats foreign and domestic. Chadwick boseman reprises the role as t'challa and He is fantastic in the role, he plays the charismatic leader very well but even more he delivers a great mix of humour and drama to this rich character. The supporting cast is one of the best assembled in marvel history so let's start with Michael b Jordan who plays the villain in this film and I found his characters journey to be one of the more interesting parts in the film and made me care about the conflict between him and t'challa. Lupita nyongo plays a love interest in this film but she is a very strong character, also her and bosemans chemistry is really good in this film and you enjoy there flirting. Danai guirra of walking dead fame plays the head of the kings guard and she is great in this film, she is great in the majority of action scenes and is a well fleshed out character in this film. In my opinion the show stealer in this film and most surprising performance by Letitia Wright who plays his sister Shuri in this film, she isbhis tech specialist and I just loved her charm and she really added a lot of energy to her role to make her such a likeable character. Martin Freeman, Andy serkis, Angela Bassett and forest Whittaker all do well in there smaller roles. The story has a great coming of age story here for t'challa and it is really interesting to see this countries uniqueness and there tribes diversity. I also liked the way the villain tied to the hero as it felt real and personal to watch. But there is a portion of the story I didn't really like which I can't talk about due to spoilers. The script has a brilliant mix of humour and drama that gave this film the best of both worlds, it was funny when it needed to be but dramatic when it needed to be. The style of the film has some really unique looking sets with great use of technology and colours to make this film stand out. Though I feel like especially towards the end of the film the action relies overly on CGI and it doesn't look that good especially for a film in 2018. Overall black panther is a great film that should be seen especially if you love these marvel movies.",8,65,171,13 February 2018
Iron Man," a masterpiece to truly kick off the marvel cinematic universe
","It's quite funny that were almost near the end of phase 2 in the marvel cinematic universe but iron man the first film is still the very best solo marvel film. The premise sees a billionaire weapons merchant who is on the verge of death and kidnapped by terrorists until he creates a suit to escape. When he gets home he changes his philosophy and decides to become the superhero iron man. Robert Downey jnr was saved by this performance and it really has changed his career for the better. His dialogue is funny and witty and the smart thing the film did was as he changed you still loved him because of his whit and I love his character. The supporting cast is also fantastic especially the relationship between Downey and Gwyneth paltrow who plays pepper Potts. I have thought that this is the best romance in a comic book film franchise ever and their chemistry in this film is great and a big part of the film. There has been allot of controversy over Terrence Howard's involvement as James Rhodes but he is great in the role and his relationship with Tony is a big part about the mortality of the film. Jeff bridges plays obediah stane and he does well in his villainous role and his chemistry is really good with Tony. The story is really good as it shows a man change and decide to do what is right. Also even though this film is called iron man I believe that it is clear that this film is about the man and not the suit. The only negative I have ever heard about this film is that the film slows down when we get the cave scenes. However, I believe that these are great and they are real character building scenes for the lead. The script is really good especially with downeys dialogue feeling natural and is just hilarious. Everybody has great pieces of dialogue that really works for this film. The style is great with the look and the designs for the suit looking great. Also the action scenes are really smooth and slick which allows you to see it all. Overall it is fantastic and a great film to start the mcu.",10,3,4,23 May 2014
Creed II," A Fantastic Sequel that brings the emotion
","I am a huge fan of the Rocky franchise and loved the first Creed film that came out a few years ago, so I was very excited to watch Creed 2 and boy this film delivered. The premise of the film sees Adonis Creed riding a high when he is challenged by Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago the man who killed his father Apollo Creed. Michael B Jordan is back in the lead in this film and he does a brilliant job, his character has such a great journey throughout this film. He has to convey so many emotions during this film and make his character likeable which is tough at times but you end up really rooting for him in this film. Sylvestre Stallone is back as Rocky and he just loves this character, he gives everything into this role to make you care about him and his relationship with Adonis Creed and it is done really well in this film. But the heart of this film in my opinion is Tessa Thompson as Bianca her relationship with Jordon is the real heart of the film and really provided an emotional performance in the film. A huge positive of the film is the anatagonists of Ivan and Viktor Drago, Dolph Lundgren is back and their story in the film is heartbreaking and dealt with really well which provides an extra layer in this film. The story in the film deals with family and how is boxing truly important compared to it. It delas with the perosnal aspect of this fight and I felt it was handled so well that it had me totally rooting for Creed in the final fight. However, the one criticsim i have for this film is that it is very predictable, if you have seen a Rocky film you know exactly how this film is going to play out. The script is great with a really good mix of drama and humour which suprisingly does work in this film. The style of the film is very grand, with amazing boxing scenes that sucked me into the atmosphere of the fight and the story very well. Overall this is a fantastic film that is one of the best films I have seen in recent memory and really deserves a watch.",9,0,1,3 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," An above average but ultimately disappointing film
","This is one of the most anticipated films of all time and 3 years after it was announced I have now finally seen this film and it is pretty disappointing. The premise sees after the events of man of steel, Bruce Wayne believes that he has to take down superman to save the world so he suits up as batman and clashes with superman. Now everybody was worried when Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne/batman but he is easily the best part of this film. He truly delivers on the dual personalities of Wayne and batman so well and brings allot to his performance. He is also great in the action scenes with this being the most hard hitting version of batman ever. Henry cavill is back as superman and he does a good job in the role. He understands the character of superman and does a good job of bringing superman to the big screen. Gal gadot plays wonder woman in this film even though she isn't in the film that much I thought she did a great job while on screen. Jeremy irons is the new Alfred and he is brilliant in the role, he adds allot of depth to the character and his interactions with Affleck are great. Unfortunately, Amy Adams Lois lane wasn't given anything interesting to do in this film. Her character wasn't very interesting which didn't help. Also Jesse eisenberg is lex luthor in this film and I couldn't stand him in the role because he had nothing in common with lex luthor. He was just an awkward guy like eisenberg is in most of his films. The story has some decent drama in it, it does a good job of seeing both Batman's and Superman's point of view. However, the films plot is a bit of a mess with there clearly being forced tie ins to other characters and just twists that come out of nowhere and make very little sense. The script does really well in the dramatic department. But just like man of steel it is a very sombre film with no well done humour. Plus all the tie ins bog down the film. The style has some really good actions involved especially the main batman v superman fight. But towards the end of the film a lot of cgi gets added to the mix and it just doesn't really work and is quite hard to follow. Overall this is an alright film that if your a fan of comic book films will see but just go in with lower expectations.",6,4,8,25 March 2016
Blade Runner," An above average dark sci fi
","In preparation for the new blade runner film coming out I decided I had to watch the original blade runner and there are things I do like about this film but I will admit that I think it is probably one of the most overrated movies ever. The premise of the film sees a special police officer on the hunt for a group of replicants that want to find there creator. Harrison ford plays deckard and I thought he was great in this film, a truly different performance from the others he was doing at the time such as han solo and Indiana Jones. He is dark, dangerous and deadly, you buy the journey he Gordon throughout this film as he learns more about these replicants and in turn himself. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, I really liked the replicants leader, I thought he was a good villain especially as the film progresses and you see more of his motivations and more of character. The character of Rachel is a tough one because I like the idea of her character I just feel like her performance was very wooden and there isn't enough of her character for you to really care. There are also some really bizarre side characters that I didn't care about and they really felt like a way to pad out this film and progress the plot. The story of this film deals with a lot of heavy themes and they are treated pretty well throughout the film especially involving deckard and his journey. However, the first hour of the film is pretty meandering and I didn't particularly find it interesting till the last act. The script is pretty poor, there is no humour in this film which does make sense considering the film given but even though this is the case absolutely none of the dramatic dialogue is particularly memorable either. The style of the film is fantastic though, the dark grimy back ally's really work and some of the CGI is great especially considering how old this film is. When they happen the action scenes are well done and especially towards the ending I really was gripped into watching them. Overall I think blade runner is an okay film but I think it could have been a lot more and I hope blade runner 2049 really delivers on that potential.",6,2,5,9 June 2017
The Greatest Showman," A great truly unique experience.
","I have been told to watch this film for a while now and I have now watched the Greatest Showman and I really enjoyed watching this film. The premise of this film sees a man come up with the idea of showcasing unique individuals in a performance to impress people. Hugh Jackman plays the lead in this film and he does such an amazing job in the role as PT Barnham in this film, you see his characters vision in the film and are rooting for him so much. He delivers in all the singing scenes and I cannot stress how perfect he was in this film. The supporting cast also does a great job, Michelle Williams plays Jackman's wife in the film and i thought she did a good job in the film, their chemistry is decent and when given some time to shine she does a pretty good job. Rebecca Fergurson is great in this film as a legit singer and you see the good and bad that her character brings to Jackman's life that actually provides some interesting storytelling in the film. Zac Efron and Zendaya are growing as perfromers and both have big roles in this film and I thought they worked very well together and made me careabout certain aspects of their story. The story has some interesting story beats that look at social issues which works as well as you would expect for a film like this. However, it always feel like the story is secondary in this film and that certain things take place just to lengthen the film out and add some drama to the film. The script has some really good quick snappy dialogue in it, expecially with fun humourous moments but it also works when it needs to turn dramatic aswell. The style of this film is so incredibly unique, the songs and dance sequences are ridiculously entertaining and catchy, they are the things that you remember coming out of this film. But some of the CGI used in the film looks poor and not completely finished which does affect the film. Overall this film is a great experience and is worth a watch for sure especially if you are a fan of musicals.",8,0,0,29 December 2018
Monsters University," The return to form for Pixar
","I will admit to being nervous about this film because Monsters Inc. is one of my favourite animated films of all time and I didn't want this film to be bad like I believe the past few have been. Luckily this film is great, not as good as the original but great none the less. This prequel to the original is based showing a younger Mike and Sulley in University and how they go from enemies to best friends. The main positive for this film is it's heart there are scenes that will hit you where you live and make u feel even more love for these two characters. But also these side characters who I thought would just be an annoyance turn out to eventually be almost as important as these two guys and they grow on you. With the great animation, twists and turns and colours that will stand out provide this film with a great coming of age story for two characters. However, it does slow down a bit at times and gets a bit boring but then a nostalgic moment hits you and makes you laugh. This is a great film hopefully leading to more great Pixar films.",8,0,1,1 April 2014
Casino Royale," The reboot bond needed
","I am lucky enough to get the chance to see spectre when it comes out in the UK next week so in preparation i thought I would review Daniel Craig's first film as bond Casino royale. The premise of the film sees bond on his first mission as 007 sees him have to enter a high stakes poker game to take down a financier of terrorism. Now many people were skeptical when Daniel Craig was cast as James bond but I think he is a fantastic bond. He provides the gruff and grit needed for the character but you can also tell that underneath there is a damaged guy who has a lot of complexity to him. He also does have a bit of charm and charisma to him when needed and I thought they used it very well. Eva green plays his associate vesper and I really liked her in this film. She was more then your average bond girl, she was complex and actually had a bit of dry wit to her. I really liked the chemistry of her and craig and thought it worked really well in the movie. Maddss mikkellson plays the villain le chifre and this is a great villain. He seemed to really enjoy the role and the character definitely had more layers to him then I expected. Judi dench is back as m and she was great in this film too. I really liked the mother son relationship between her and bond and again it was used very well in this movie. The story of this film is very interesting to me. I find the last hour to be the most entertaining because I thought the tournament was incredibly tense and I loved the character development that all the main players got. The script has some great dramatic moments but also allot of good banter and some funny exchanges between characters in the film. The style of the action scenes was phenomenal and absolutely what this film needed. If was bloody and brutal and I enjoyed every action scene in this film. However, my one negative for this film is that the first hour of the film has a few pacing issues and it feels a bit uneven at times. This film is the batman begins for bond movies and if your a bond fan or just a fan of great action movies then this is a must see.",9,1,6,23 October 2015
Trainspotting," A fantastic gritty British film
","With the sequel coming out very soon I knew I had to watch trainspotting and this is a truly fantastic unique film. The premise of the film sees a guy try to get clean from drugs which is proved hard due to his addiction and his bad influence friends. This was the film that truly put Ewan McGregor on the map as he is truly amazing in this film, he gives some truly memorable monologues that will stick with you as the film goes on and after it as well. He has the best character development in this film and he is the guy we root for even though he does some questionable things in this film. Robert Carlyle plastic begdbie in this film and he is really fun to watch as he clearly shows his anger problems in pretty funny if not disturbing ways. The characters of spud and sick boy aren't given loads of time to develop but they are fun to watch and the chemistry between all the characters is really good and easy to watch. The story has a good journey of McGregor's character as he develops throughout the film as you see his character progression. However,there are some pointless story arcs in this film such as McGregor's romance that ends up not being resolved and comes across as a bit of a waste of time. The script is absolutely fantastic with some brilliant dialogue and character interactions that make these characters really interesting and fun to watch. The style of this film is very unique and a bit bizarre at times but it works for this film. The style has a really low budget but it works as Danny Boyle uses Evey trick he has to make this film as memorable as possible. Overall this is a fantastic film that does make me excited for the sequel.",9,0,0,11 January 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," A fantastic emotional film
","I have heard allot of great things about this film and it is truly a fantastic film. The premise of the film sees the author of mary poppins in a dispute with walt Disney about what vision they see for the character. Emma thompson plays pl travers the author of mary poppins and she does a really good job. At first she seems a bit unlikeable but as the film progresses she gets captured in the magic and you see her become more likable but you understand her feelings because of how she feels about these characters. Tom hanks plays walt Disney and he does a great job in this film. He is just a really likable guy who wants to give people what they want and whether this film is truly accurate but I don't really care because he does a great job and the leads chemistry is great. Paul giamatti plays travers driver and even though it's not the biggest role he is crucial because he adds humanity to travers character and he brings great brightness to this film. Colin Farrell in this film is absolutely fantastic in this film, he delivers a performance of Oscar calibre because of the layers he has and the great performance he gives. Everybody else does a great job with there being no bad performance in the whole film. The story has great intrigue to it, even though from the description you would think its a bit dull it just really isn't. It has depth to it's narrative and fleshes out the characters so you care about them. The script has great dialogue with some well placed humour in it but so much great drama that really put this film above good. The style has perfect tone for the subject matter. However, my main negative for this film is the pacing is a bit slow and drags at times plus the ending is pretty abrupt. Overall this is a fantastic movie that is definitely worth a watch especially if your a fan of mary poppins.",9,4,6,27 April 2016
Jojo Rabbit," A Fantastic really funny film
","The first film I have seen in 2020 is Jojo Rabbit, a film that has been predicted to do incredibly well at the Oscars this year so I was intrigued to watch this film and I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. The premise of the movie sees a young Nazi trying to find his place when he comes across a Jewish Girl.Main Character
Roman Griffith Davis is a young child actor and this is the first film I have seen him in but I don't think it will be the last in this film as he is truly fantastic in this film. His character Jojo goes through a really emotional journey throughout the film and you end up really caring about this character even though he is a Nazi. This is literally one of the best child performances in recent memory and I am curious how much recognition he will get and when we will see him next.Supporting Characters
This film has a really impressive supporting cast and first to Taika Waititi who is also the Director of this movie, he plays Adolf Hitler in this film and is Davis's imaginery friend in the film. He is brilliant in this film and delivers a great over the top performance that provides some really funny moments in this film. He and Davis have really great chemistry in the film and really provide some stand out moments in the film. Scarlett Johansson plays Jojo's mother in the film and she also delivers a good performance, she plays the loving mother very well and you believe in her relationship with Jojo. Her character has a bit of mystery to it but that doesn't get enough time to fully invest you but she is a good character in this film. Thomasin Mckenzie plays the Jewish Girl in this film and her and Davis's chemistry is very good and their development is the emotional crux in the movie so in order for you to believe in this film you have to care about their story. Sam Rockwell, Alfie Allen & Rebel Wilson are also really funny in this film and give good performances.Story
This film was pretty much marketed as a comedy so I was curious how the story was going to be but it was pretty good. As mentioned the relationship between Davis & Mckenzie's characters is the part that invested me and made me care about the these characters and the story that they go through in the film. However, I feel like the story wasn't as strong as it could have been, there are certain elements of the story involving other characters that don't get enough time for you to really care about them, and with the film being only around 1 Hour 40 Minutes there could have been time for this.Script
This film does focus on the humourous side and does an excellent job. If you like darker humour this film is definitley for you. Waititi especially provides tons of laughs and after his performance as Korg in Thor Ragnarok, he truly is built for really funny supporting roles. The drama though is suprisngly very good, you really will care about these characters and the plight that they are in, especiallly as the film comes towards its conclusion.Style
This film is a very funny film, it knows when to take itself seriously though and does a really good job of finding the balance between the two types of tone where it doesn't take away from each other. It deals with the subject matter in a really fun way and this film has a very unique feeling which gives it extra poimts in my opinion.Overall
This in my opinion is a fantastic film that really made me laugh and gave me a real fun time in the cinema. If you like films with dark humour this is a film for you and even if you aren't this film could be for you and you should give it a chance.",9,4,10,3 January 2020
X2: X-Men United," One of the greatest comic book films of all time
","X men 2 is simply put one of the greatest comic book films and just films of all time. This film takes the X men trilogy to a whole new level of awesomeness adding levels for every character. This story picks up right after the original X men and really picks up the pace in this trilogy. This story introduces William Stryker a man tied to Wolverine's past who wants to eradicate all mutants, which really sets up my favourite part of the film which is the alliance between the X Men and Magneto and Mystique which sets up all types of great dialogue and comic book fan's dreams coming true. Hugh Jackman is once again fantastic as Wolverine as is Ian McKellen as Magneto with everybody else being great including a very attractive Halle Berry as Storm and the new character Nightcrawler. Professor X and Cyclops are not in the film as much as the original which is a bit of a downside but just everything about this film including the ending which is absolutely awesome and sets up more X men films. In the top 5 comic book films of all time at this moment and a fantastic film must see.",9,0,1,2 April 2014
Thor: The Dark World," A great sequel and a great addition to this universe.
","I thought with Avengers 2 coming up I would rewatched Thor 2 and even though I didn't enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it it is still a great film and a great addition to this universe. The premise of this film sees the dark elves return to cover the universe in darkness using an old weapon. Thor, Jane foster and an unlikely ally attempt to stop the elves dark plan. Chris Hemsworth is well known for his role as Thor and he is great in the role and is a hero who I think can be loved by everybody. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag, Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and he is great in this film and really adds allot to the film. His chemistry with hemsworth is great and he is one villain that interests the audience. Anthony Hopkins is back as Odin and he is great in the role as the dad figure and wise figure even though he is also a little flawed in the film. I think ever since the star wars prequels Natalie Portman has struggled and she just didn't really fit in this or text first film and their relationship doesn't really have any feel to it or believability. Also Christopher Eccleston plays the head of the dark elves but I felt like he was underused and completely forgettable, which wasn't helped by the appearance of Loki. There was some interesting relationships in the film and some of the story felt well done. However, character motivations aren't revealed and the overall execution of the story feels weak. The script was really good with there being some good humour in the film and also the drama really worked in the film and helped make this film great. The style of the film was great, with all the action scenes being really good and the cgi of asgard looking better in this film. Overall I really like this film and think it is a great comic book film.",8,1,1,20 April 2014
Lucy," A poor ridiculous film
",Apparently the idea of this film took 10 years to get realised that for some people that was ten years wasted. The premise of this film sees a girl get forced to take this drug which slowly unlocks her brain to 100%. Scarlett Johansson is one if the biggest actresses in Hollywood and she delivers a decent performance. She transitions from frightened girl to action hero pretty well. It's just her character becomes so powerful that she becomes impossible to relate to and hard to empathise to. Morgan freeman is decent in the movie too even though he basically just plays the same thing as always. The villain in the film has nothing to him because he stands as no opposition to Lucy at all. The guy she hangs out with also has absolutely no depth to him and you won't care. The story has absolutely no depth to it at all and you won't care about any of the characters. The tension just isn't there because Lucy has absolutely no opposition in the film at all and no emotion. The script us either cliché dialogue or expositional scientific dialogue that you don't understand. There are some alright action scenes in the film but the style of this film is bold and ridiculous. They show animals in situations to explain stuff and just forget about it and the action becomes just absurd. Overall this is a poor action film that you really don't need to see.,3,4,10,8 September 2015
Midway," A Great War Film
","I am usually a big fan of war films so I was excited to see Midway and I have to say I really enjoyed the experience of watching this film. The premise of the film sees after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour a group of US Forces have to predict the Japanese next attack and hit them first. Ed Skrein plays the main character in this film and I thought he did a really good job in the film, usually he has been known as a good supporting actor but he steps up here and I thought did a good job in the lead. I cared about his character and he was a protagonist that was easy to sympathise with along with a huge cast of good performances. Patrick Wilson plays a big character in this film as the head of intelligence and I thought he did a really good job, you just see how the pressure is affecting him throughout the movie and he was an interesting character in this film. Luke Evans is one of my favourite actors and he does a really good job in the film, Skrein and him have some tension in the film but you can tell their is respect there and you do still care about his character. Woody Harrelson and Aaron Eckhart have smaller roles in this film and they both fit their roles well. Alos a shout out to the Japanese actors who do really good work with the material that is given. The story is your usual War film and does a good job of making you care about the American heroes and their plight. However, I felt like for a part the film tries to make this film from a bit of a balanced perspective between the US and Japan but then the film moves away from it and makes the Japanese seem evil and The US as the conquering heroes which I thought was a missed opportunity. The script has some really good drama in it and a nice use of humour to flesh out the characters, I also liked how their was a strong use of Japanese as it actually made sense for the film. The style is visually pretty stunning, the battle scenes look absolutley brilliant and they will keep your eyes on the screen. But I felt like this film had a bit of a pacing issue keeping you fully invested in the whole of the film, including the film going a bit longer then was unneccessary. Overall this is a great tribute to the real life events and a great action film that is worth a watch.",8,4,6,15 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An epic return to the star wars universe
","After ten years of waiting we finally have a new star wars film and this is easily one of the most anticipated films of all time and it really delivers. The premise of this film is that 30 years after the empire was destroyed a new order has risen in its place. With the help of some new allies the resistance attempt to save the world. Now when the casting was released the biggest surprise was newcomer daisy ridley was playing a big role in the film but she stole the show. Rey was one of the most interesting characters in recent memories and she just felt very relatable and real to me as a viewer. John boyega plays finn and he is also fantastic in this film. He was a conflicted hero but you liked his character because of his likable personality and his chemistry with ridley. Oscar Isaac plays Poe dameron the best pilot in the resistance and he is possibly the coolest character in the film. He isn't in the film a huge deal but does a fantastic job at making you care about his character. Adam driver plays the villain kylo ren and he did a great job at creating a villain who does have some human qualities to him and some memorable moments. A special shout out has to go to go to Harrison ford returning as Han solo. Not too long ago we saw him unsuccessfully return as indiana Jones but he absolutely delivers in this film. His character is really developed and it feels natural for him to return. The story is really good, yes it is familiar but it really works. It is always moving and for this film that is really important to keep you invested. There is allot of emotion added to the narrative that works very well. The script is really good, this is probably the funniest star wars film ever but also has allot of emotion to it that doesn't feel out of place. The style is back to the more gritty star wars that utilises both practical and cgi effects superbly. The action scenes are all filmed beautifully but they felt more intense then ever before. Overall this film really delivered and I can't wait to go see it again.",10,14,48,17 December 2015
Flight," a heart felt exciting Drama
",This film is totally contrast throughout there are moments of absolute brilliance and also moments where I was so bored I wanted to turn the film off because I was bored. Denzel Washington stars as a pilot which lands a crashing plane while under the influence of Alcohol and the film documents the trials and tribulations he must endure throughout. Now I must say first Denzel Washington completely deserved his Oscar Nomination for his performance as his performance is the part of the film that you follow and he is the character that the audience needs to connect with. The side characters are all believable in their role and are superb in their performances. To properly describe this film the opening part where he is in the plane crash is heart stopping and fantastic but then it also stops and slows down a lot which is the boring part and then it becomes heart wrenching and tense towards the end of the film which makes this film a great film but not to the level of other similar films like The Wrestler.,8,1,2,30 April 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fantastic end to this universally loved franchise
","I have now finished the harry potter films in preparation for fantastic beasts and where to find them. So I have watched the deathly hallows part two and after a bit of a disappointing part one this film really had to deliver and yes this film is fantastic. The premise of the film sees harry, Ron and Hermione on the search for the remaining horcruxes and getting ready to take on voldermort's forces. Daniel Radcliffe really delivers a fantastic performance in this film as harry as you see him finally stepping up to the plate and becoming a true leader of the wizards against voldermort's. Emma Watson and Rupert grint really encapsulate the characters of Hermione and Ron, there chemistry together really works and there development feels very personal along with Harry's. Ralph fienes finally gets the time to shine as lord voldermort an he is a great villain that truly works perfectly for this film. I just wish maybe we could have seen more of him over the franchise. Alan rickman gets time to really shine as snape in this film and his character probably has the best development over this film and maybe even the whole franchise. All the other supporting characters especially Neville get time to shine and they give great finality to the characters. The story has some great moments in it, you feel the epicness of the final confrontation and the character development throughout this film. My only negative in this film is that the film towards the end possibly rushes some of the important story arcs but overall I did like the story. The script has some great drama in it and as I mentioned before it really helped make the finality feel more strong in this film. There is a slight lack of humour but in this film I actually think it made this film more serious and epic. The style of this film is probably the best of the franchise with excellent action scenes and overall better pacing then previous films. So that is it a fantastic finish to a great franchise that you should experience yourself.",9,0,1,18 September 2016
Unbroken," An above average dramatic film
","I was very interested in seeing this film and I have finally seen it and it is an alright film but ends up being disappointing. The premise of this film is set in world war 2 where it shows an Olympian turned war hero attempt to survive a Japanese prisoner of war camp. I am a fan of jack o connell and this is definitely his best ever performance. He really did a good job of making you care about him and really feeling for his character in this predicament that no human being should go through. Domnhall gleeson is his army buddy and he was good in the movie and their relationship was the first relationship I cared about in the film. The villain was pretty good as well and you really don't like in this film which means he is doing his job right. However, there wasn't any other interesting supporting characters in the camp which doesn't help the film. The story of them initially trying to survive on the raft was very interesting as well as his time in the Olympics. However, the film derails when he gets to the camp and the film really slows down and it just doesn't hit the emotional levels that it needs. The script is okay with some of the drama working for the film but some of it just doesn't hit as much as it wants to and it hurts the film. The style of the film looks beautiful and all the cinematography is great and makes you feel with o connell. But as mentioned before the pacing of the film is a bit all over the place and it hurts the structure of the film. Overall this is a decent film but I wanted it to be better.",6,0,0,13 October 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of the Middle Earth Journey
","Well this film in my opinion is possibly the best ever. This is the end of the Lord of the rings trilogy so it is a sad experience at the end, but this film is absolutely epically epic. This film leads where the Two Towers left off with the Evil powers gaining strength for the final conclusion against all men while Frodo,Sam and Gollum head to Mordor. Everything is ten times bigger in thee stakes and importance as this film really plays up the fact that this trilogy is based throughout a year of these characters life and failure is not an option. Every character is better then they were in the last film even the lesser characters of people from Rohan and Gondor are acted magnificently and really live up to the expectations of this film. There isn't much more to say about this film but SEE IT as it is the most epic master class of film ever with great cinematography, action, drama and action. A film for the ages.",10,1,2,10 March 2014
The Purge," An awful waste of potential
","I am not a big fan if horror films at all but I gave the purge a chance to show me what it had. And this film is just your awful dull cliché horror film. The premise is that once every year murder is made legal for 12 hours so people can use their rage, this is called the purge. After a boy tries to help somebody it brings a group of murderers to there front door. Now I think Ethan hawke is a decent actor and I think he did a decent job in this film with what he was given. His character does have some development and you end up kind of liking him but he is just a pretty boring character. Lena heady is in this film and she does a good job as well with her character being more sympathetic and easier to like but also tough as well. But the kids and the villains in the film are just ridiculous. There characters are hugely unlikeable and have nothing good about them in any way. The premise of this film is really unique but the film absolutely fails to deliver on it. It doesn't matter if murder is legal for this film to work it is just your simple home invasion horror film that you will not care about. The script has nothing to it with no interesting dialogue and really all the characters aren't written very well. The style is poor as well, all the jump scares are predictable and lazy and the action that there is just feels like poor horror action. Overall I was really disappointed with this film and I hope the purge anarchy is allot better.",2,1,1,29 August 2015
Godzilla," A solid start to a new potential franchise
","I have never seen the previous Godzilla film but from the trailers I saw this quickly became one of my most anticipated films of the year and even though this film didn't live up to those expectations this is a solid good film. This film stars Bryan Cranston who lives to find out what the scientists are hiding from an accident in the past, this ends up with the King of monsters Godzilla in a huge encounter for the Earth. Now even though the trailers clearly show Bryan Cranston as the lead character and even though he has the most emotional scenes, best acting and best lines in the film he is not the main character but just a supporting character. The lead is actually Aaron-Taylor Johnson and he may be the most boring protagonist of all time as just an average soldier and his wife Elizabeth Olsen's character is no better and just as dull in the film. A good side character is Ken Watanabe's character who provides the exposition for the film and good at doing it. The script doesn't really help these actors and the fact that this film focuses on the soldiers instead of the monsters. However, where this film really gets its style right Godzilla has never been better and he looks better then ever and also his adversaries are also extremely cool. The world that Director Gareth Edwards has created a beautiful looking world which I want to be continued. This film is the ultimate tease and only the action towards the end make up for it and with this awesome action scene that truly saves the film and makes it the really good film that it is. This film has it's problems but I believe they can be fixed easily and hopefully the sequel fixes these and adds to the action to really create a great franchise.",7,3,6,4 June 2014
Life," An average by the numbers horror movie
","When I saw the trailer for this film I thought to myself that it looked like a complete rip off of the film alien, now I have seen it and I believe my fears were very justified. The premise of the film sees a crew of scientists in space come into contact with an alien organism. Jake gyllenhall plays the lead in this film and he does an alright job, he is a top quality actor and he does his best with what he is given. But his character is really bland and not given anything to work with really, which is a complaint I have with pretty much every character in this film. Rebecca Ferguson is in this film and similar to gyllenhall she does a decent job despite the fact her character is pretty boring. Ryan Reynolds is in this film and he is easily the best part of this film, he provides his usual charismatic charm that makes him the one really likable person in this film. The rest of the cast are really underdeveloped and you won't really care about any of them. The story of the film is as mentioned before not original, you have seen it all before and there isn't really anything that stands out. That is except the ending which I really loved, no spoilers but it really was a unique interesting ending. The script started off pretty strong with some pretty decent witty dialogue especially from Reynolds. But the drama is very bland and I didn't care for the dramatic moments in the film. The style of this film does have some interesting sequences in it that can be quite thrilling. But then we come to the design of the organism which I didn't like at all, I just had no interest in its development or any of the science behind it. Overall life is a pretty average film that just isn't worth a watch just watch alien instead.",5,0,1,9 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The start of the best trilogy and films ever made
","This film and the original Star Wars has a special place in my heart as it was the first film and trilogy I remember seeing as a child and I must say 10 years later it is still one of the best films of all time. When pushed for my favourite film of all time I am always struggling to pick between the three Star Wars films or the three Lord Of the Rings but I must say when a film can just make you smile no matter what mood your in or no matter how many times you have seen it that film holds a special case in your heart like Star Wars has for me. This film starts in space with the Evil Empire attempting to destroy a bunch of Rebels against their regime, through some events young Luke Skywalker meets a seasoned Jedi Warrior Obi Wan Kenobi and along with some friends embark on a mission to take down the Empire. Now everybody in this film has a great performance but their are two very different performances that may be the greatest performances ever. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is everything a man wants to be he just oozes confidence and takes no garbage from anybody including princess Leia overall he grows with this trilogy and as a character but Han Solo in my opinion is easily one of the best characters of all time. Also when talking about villains in film history in my opinion the most intimidating and villainous force in any movie has to be Darth Vader this entity is just the most evil character ever put on screen and is also the most intriguing villain of all time. Now when this film came out it changed cinema and changed the game for how we see film now, also I did watch Star Wars to review this on the DVD version so there was some tweaks but I just try to use the score, the characters and the settings to pull me back into Star Wars land and forget about these differences. Overall a flawless attempt at sci-fi to open a trilogy that in my opinion while never be bested in my eyes.",10,0,1,4 April 2014
50_50," a real dramady that knows how to pull on heart strings
","Going into this film I saw that it had a really high rating on this website and I was worried if it could live up to the hype but boy does it ever. This film sees Andy a 27 year old and healthy who one day finds out he has cancer In his spine and his survival rate is 50/50. The story then documents how he and people around him react to this devastating news. Now I really do like Joseph gordon levitt as an actor and he owns this film with his wonderful performance that shows just how good he is. He shows just how a human being would act in his position and he goes through all the emotions and his performance drags you into this film. The supporting cast also do a good job with Seth rogen being the key one, he provides the main comedy in the film but there is also some heart in it plus he has good chemistry with levitt. Anna Kendrick plays his therapist and she does a good job too with her attitude being a big plus in andys life plus once again their chemistry was really good. Andy's girlfriend does a good job in the film and she does a good job in playing a 3 dimensional character and everybody else did a sound job too. The story is really good documenting the real way somebody in this situation would react and it documents the life of Andy perfectly. Their is a few clichés but you forget about them when the last 15 mins happens and all the emotions are pushed to the limit and it is fantastic. The script is great, all the dialogue is delivered well and it made the film feel as realistic as possible. The style is alright but sometimes the mix of comedy and drama didn't always work but for a lot of the time it did. Overall this is a fantastic film that I want my whole family to see.",9,0,0,17 October 2014
Deadpool," A fantastic game changing comic book film
","Deadpool has been a film I have been looking forward to for a few years now but I was always worried about its execution but fear not this film is fantastic. The premise of this film sees an ex secret service soldier with a wicked sense of humour transformed into deadpool a mercenary on the hunt for his creator. Ryan reynolds has been lobbying for this role for a few years and he has succeeded in his redemption. This is the perfect role for him because of how much he loves the character, he is the loudmouth outlandish character that you totally want out of deadpool but he also brings some humanity to the character. morenna baccarin plays the love interest vanessa and she was a really good character in the film her chemistry with reynolds was brilliant and it really helped me by their romance. Ed skrien plays the villain in this film and fair play to him because he does a good job even though his character is quite cliché he really worked for this film. Everybody else was great, collosus, negasonic teenage warhead, weasel and angel dust also really added allot to the film. The story of this film is very simple but it plays on the simplicity for humour and it works. Also the flashbacks documenting deadpools rise was great stuff. The script is one of the most unique ever written probably in film history. The humour is great with so many in jokes and some well placed drama. However, sometimes the jokes just don't hit because they were in the trailer. The style of the film is brilliant the combination of humour and action really works and this film needed to be the rated R film that it ended up being. Overall this is a fantastic success of a film and I so want a sequel.",9,4,13,17 February 2016
300," awesome visceral battle
","This is an exciting visceral film and is definitely a guy film. The film refers to the ancient battle of 300 Spartans taking on the armies of at least 10,000 Persians and this film portrays just how epic this clash really was. All the performances are good and when the battle happens you feel emotionally attached to these characters as they go on their quest. The main attraction is watching the action between these tough Spartan against the outmatched Persian's and how gory, thematic and over the top all the killing is in this film. The secondary plot also is intriguing and provides a little break in the film from the huge amounts of action and violence in it. The ending to the film is incredible and really fits the tone of the film providing a great climax. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel and hope it has similar levels of action, intrigue and violence as this great film.",9,0,2,13 March 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," a great film that does exactly what it aims for
","Going into kingsman I had high hopes for a fun film and I believe that I got it in this hilariously fun spy comedy film. This film sees a young chav recruited into a secret spy organisation and with the help of his mentor he must defeat a crazy internet hacker who plans to destroy mankind. Newcomer tara egerton plays eggsy a character that could have been really annoying but he manages to pull off this role masterfully. He has enough charm and charisma to make you care about him and his situation and you really want to see him succeed, plus he is really funny. It helps that they give him a supporting cast that is filled with some of Hollywood's elite, Colin furth plays his mentor and he is like a more violent version of roger Moore's bond. He was funny and likable but this is the best action he has ever done. Samuel l Jackson plays the villain and he was great everything he said was just really funny, they gave the character a lisp and I truly believe that any other actor wouldn't have made this work but he really does make it work. Michael caine is the head of kingsman and he is great as always just like mark strong who plays the trainer of the recruits and he is great in his role too. The story is the one big let down in the film for me though, now I know that this film is all about fun and some people would argue that story doesn't matter but it does. The villains motivation seems crazily over the top and just not convincing at all. Also their is a direction they take half way through the film and I must say that I think it was a bad decision. The script is fantastic with the humour all working for me and hitting the right places. The interactions between characters makes this film feel alive and great. The style has been much talked about but i think it is great and this film wouldn't have worked without it. The action is all awesome ans there is a particular scene in a church that is one of the most memorable action scenes in recent memory. Overall this is a great film and one that you should definitely see.",8,1,7,12 February 2015
Fast Five," A Good Fun Heist Film
","With Hobbs & Shaw coming up, I thought I would go back and watch the first Fast and Furious film where Luke Hobbs is a main character Fast Five and out of all the Fast and Furious films I have watched so far this is slightly my favourite. The premise of the film sees the gang led by Dominic Torretto have to complete a huge heist while being hunted by special agent Luke Hobbs. Vin Diesel has become known for this franchise and he is entertaining to watch in the role of Dom but I don't think anybody has ever said Vin Diesel is a great actor and he is very one dimensional in this film which to be honest I expected. The late Paul Walker is in this film and he is similar to Diesel, he fits the role he needs to fit well but his character doesn't really stand out at all and there is very little to grasp onto in term of interest. As mentioned this was the first time Dwayne Johnson played the character of Luke Hobbs and he is great here, he is the one character with real development in the film and you really see his character go through plenty in this film. The rest of the crew are fun to be with, Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris have great chemistry and really bring some fun to the film and it is nice to see a pre Wonder Woman Gal Gadot do a decent job in the film. The story is fun and never really stops moving, I really enjoy the heist idea and feel it really helped keep this film fun and interesting with some good twists and turns. However, because of this frantic pacing there isn't much time for the important dramatic moments in the film which means I wasn't as invested in the action scenes as I didn't care enough about the characters. The script was good, the drama works in the film when it is used and the humour provides the necessary laughs without making this film a comedy. The style of these films are usually impressive, this film has great action scenes but they aren't insane in this one which in my opinion makes it more entertaining to watch as it is slightly plausible. Overall this is a highly entertaining action film that if you are a fan of this franchise is a worthy addition.",7,0,0,27 July 2019
Green Book," An Epic truly special film
","This film has been gaining a ton of buzz especially with Oscar season coming around so I had to see Green Book and this is one of my favourite films over the last few years. The Premise of the film is set in the 1960's and sees and Italian - American Man become a driver for a Black Piano Player as he travels the deep south of America. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead in this film, he is totally brilliant in this film, This smooth talking guy is so fun to watch with that everyday charm about him that makes him totally relatable to us the audience as he tries to help this rich man. He will definitley be a frontrunner for the Oscar which is great to see as I haven't seen Mortensen in that much recently. Mahershala Ali is absolutley brilliant in thsi film, his character arc in this film is truly important to watch, seeing these two guys learning from each other is truly fascinating to watch. He gives a really powerful performance that in my opinion will give him the Oscar this year. The rest of the supporting cast all fit their roles very well and immerse you into the story that you are watching. The story sees these two very different people go on an emotional journey of deiscovery dealing with some heavy issues and build a truly great story. It is a bit predictable but I believe that actually worked for this film. The script is actually pretty hilarious with a lot of funny moments that really worked for this film. But when the drama is needed it delivers some truly amazing moments in this film. The style is great, I wasn't bored once in this film and I loved seeing the different parts of America and how they react to this situation. Overall this is a film you must see to appreciate and is definitley going to be up there for my best movies of the year.",10,1,3,30 January 2019
Da 5 Bloods," An Above Average dramatic film
","This film hit Netflix yesterday and I have now seen Da 5 Bloods and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Four African American Vets return to Vietnam to find the remains of their old leader and the gold that they hid together.
Main Character
Delroy Lindo plays the most fleshed out character and he is amazing here. He owns every scene he is in, there are times where you can't take your eyes off of him, he is the one most affected by the war and he does a really good job of portraying this. He is the most interesting character in the film and I thought he was the best part of this entire film.
Supporting Characters
The rest of the crew have good chemistry together, but there is no doubt that I didn't care about them anywhere as much as Lindo and I felt like as the film progressed I cared less and less about them. Chadwick Boseman is in this film and does a decent job when he is on screen but he doesn't really have much of a character, we are told all these good things about him but we never see him so it makes you question just how good he is. The rest of the cast didn't do much for me whether they were protagonists or antagonists they were pretty dull and generic.
Story
This story has an interesting premise to it, as you see these guys hunt for this gold you see how it affects them and how there lives have changed and it is done well. Also this film has plenty of moral and political questions to ask and some of it was handled well, others not. This film has too many side plots that feel pointless and it takes up a good part of the first act making it pretty much an hour in before they actually go on their journey and by then I was a bit bored. Also this film tries to mix real life issues with this film and I thought it was handled very clumsily, it feels like Spike Lee the director was trying to send a very clear message but in my opinion it took away from the movie and felt like he was just was trying to tell the history of black culture which is obviously important but I am just not sure if it was needed in this film.
Script
The script has some really grest dramatic dialogue, it has some really memorable moments and builds the tension really well. The humour used here didn't really work for me and I think that will be a subjective thing but I think it also had something to do with how it was used sometimes leading to a clashing of tones.
Style
The film as mentions does a great job in building suspense and tension, there are some really uncomfortable scenes and this film did a great job with it. Also there are a few good shootouts here when they happen and this film is filmed really well with a unique style to it. But I can't help but mention that the pace is just off, the first hour is so slow and with the film being 2 and a half hours it needs to grip you early but for me it just didn't.
Overall
Overall, this is clearly a passion project by Spike Lee and there are some highlights for sure mainly being his style and the lead performance. Though, I don't believe this will be remembered as one of his greats as sometimes his beliefs overpower the story and this is a longer film then it needed to be. If you are a fan of war films then this might be for you and it is a decent watch but I wouldn't say it is one to rush to see.",6,5,14,13 June 2020
Fantastic Four," A Terrible waste of time
","I have never been a big fan of the fantastic four in the comics or as characters so this film was already behind before it began with me but I still gave it a chance and oh my did it suck. The story starts with broke scientist Reed Richards proposing to his old friend/enemy Victor Von Doom an experiment in space that could help cure disease. Along with Sue Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm they go into space and after an accident they all return with there own unique abilities. Now the main two that are focused on is Reed and Sue and there past and present relationships, the guy they got to play Reed is terrible and really lacks the acting chops to play a character like this. Also even though Jessica Alba is beautiful she is not a very good actress and she fails to deliver a good performance as Sue. The side characters are a mixed bag I actually thought Chris Evans performance as Johnny Storm was good and he was easily the best character of the film. I also thought the guy they got to play Ben was good and he managed to make you feel for him in his situation. But one of my favourite villains in marvel is DR Doom but he is not well done hear in fact it is pretty poor with his motivation and real presence in the film not really mattering and taking a real back seat to the Fantastic four. Another side character you meet briefly is a blind woman that is meant to be trying to help ben get through life but it is just so hard to buy as you only see her like 2 or 3 times. The story takes bad tropes from past comic book films that did it much better and it just is nonsense half of the time and peoples motivations are not really well enough explained. The script is also trash and I later found out that Chris Evans made up a lot of his lines which makes sense as he is really the only one who has any decent lines in the whole film. The style being the fantastic four you would think would be great but it isn't I mean the Human Torch looks cool and heck even Doom looks cool when he becomes Dr Doom but the others looks silly and the whole cinematography is just off. So overall avoid this film and look forward to the new reboot that is coming.",2,0,3,18 August 2014
Pineapple Express," Another solid Seth Rogen comedy
","This film is just like other comedies from this crew but just like those this film is really solid and everything they touch is decent. This film sees a drug user Seth Rogen and his dealer James Franco attempting to escape from the powers above. Now Rogen and Franco are fantastic and their chemistry is great, Everything they touch turns to gold and they keep producing solid film after solid film. The Side characters are all solid Danny McBride as Red was funny when he was there and was a really funny supporting character. Rogen's girlfriend and the bad guys are all funny and solid and really bring something to the film. Now a real negative to the film is that of the story, there isn't really a coherent plot and side characters leave and arrive out of nowhere and it makes the film feel disjointed. The script is really good just like the other comedies by this group and each character seems to get their moment to shine. The style was decent but sometimes a bit ridiculous and over bloody which can be a critic on these films. Overall I enjoyed this film and I think this crew are doing some great work recently.",7,2,3,11 July 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," A fantastic sequel that keeps the action up full notch
","John Wick is one of my favourite action films of recent memory so I was so excited for this film and I am happy to tell you that I loved this film. The premise of this film sees it start a few days after the last film where Wick has to repay a debt to an old friend and get dragged back into the criminal life. Keannu Reeves once again plays John Wick and he is truly amazing in this film, he is perfect in the action scenes doing the majority of the stunts himself and adding amazing realism to the awesome action scenes in this film. Yes sometimes his delivery of dialogue is a little wooden but I thought he had charisma to him and a coolness that sold me on his character once again. Ian Mcshane is back for this film in a larger role and he is great in this film, i loved his and Reeves chemistry in the film and I thought his character had more depth in this film 'then the first. I did like the guy wick has to work for in this film, he had a mix of charisma and intimidation that i bought him in the role. Common plays a guard for wick's target and he does a good job in the film once again in the action scenes that he does a great job in. My only problem with the cast is Ruby Rose, after her performance in XXX I was hoping for better in this film but she is really overacting in this film and I found her character very cheesy. The plot in this film is okay with wick having to go to different locations and show his true survival instinct in the film. I also really liked how this film expands on the universe that was established in the first film. However, this film's narrative has nowhere near the emotional impact that the first did and you feel like John doesn't really want to go on this mission so why should you. The script has some pretty decent dramatic dialogue that maybe isn't extraordinary but I thought it worked for this film. There is also a bit more humour in this film and it is handled well. The style of this film is absolutely amazing, it has allot more vibrant colours in the film and the action scenes are absolutely out of this world. Long takes of the most creative, devastating action scenes I think I have ever seen and huge credit has to go to Reeves and the stunt team for there amazing commitment to their roles. Overall even though I slightly preferred the first film, I think this is one of the best action sequels of all time and must be seen if you are an action fan or a fan of great movies.",9,6,12,18 February 2017
Annihilation," An awful indulgent film
","This film has ad some buzz building about it so I have now seen Annihilation and i feel like this is a film you are either going to love or hate and I am one of the few people that hated this film. The plot of this film sees a group of women search an unknown location to work out what is happening there. Natalie Portman plays the lead in this film and she does an okay job, she does her best to try and get the best out of her character. Unfortunately, her character is just so bland and boring, there just isn't much about her that makes her interesting or to make you care about her character and her plight. The supporting cast has a lost of big names in it such as Oscar Issac, Tessa Thompson, Benedict Wong and Jennifer Jason Leigh.But none of these big performers give anything to their characters to make them interesting enough to care even though they are recognizable actors. and actresses. The story in the film is both familiar but also confusing and nonsensical, seeing this group of women together makes you think of more interesting movies where you actually care about the members of the team. Towards the end of the film this film just gets ridiculous and laughable to lengths i can't explain because I am not really sure what was completely going on. The script has very basic drama in it that as mentioned before doesn't make you care enough, and with no humor in this film this script is incredibly weak. The style of this film in a visual sense is absolutely breathtaking with luscious backdrops, but this doesn't make a good film. The pacing of this film is really slow and I was bored for the majority of this film meaning i checked out and didn't particularly follow the bizarre ending. Overall as mentioned earlier, some people might like this film but I just found this film very indulgent and a waste of potential.",2,9,18,29 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My favourite film of all time
","Now I must say there are other films that come close but the Empire Strikes Back is my favourite and the best movie I have ever seen. This film has everything a sequel should do the same fantastic performances as the first, the stakes raised and also added struggles and revelations for the characters. The 2nd film in the star wars franchise kicks off a few months after the original with the Empire and Darth Vader tracking the rebels and eventually finding them from there Luke goes to Dagobah to learn from Jedi master Yoda while Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO attempt to avoid the empire. This film takes the bold move of splitting the characters up to two stories providing more substance to this film than the previous film even though that is great too. This film is truly when Darth Vader comes into the forefront he is now in full charge of the imperial forces and is awesome and evil at the same time. This film has exciting action, heartfelt moments and one heck of a tense climax with possibly the biggest revelation in film industry. If you haven't seen the original you will be lost at the beginning but what are you doing if you haven't seen the original star wars. Go watch them now!",10,0,0,8 April 2014
Incredibles 2," A fantastic sequel that is well worth the wait
","The first incredibles film is one of my favourite films of all time and I can't believe we have had to wait 15 years for a sequel but we have finally been given it and if you are a fan of the first film you will enjoy this film, hopefully as much as I did. The premise of the film sees being a superhero made illegal, elastigirl is sent out to give supers a better outlook while Mr incredible is left to look after the kids. I think Craig T Nelson and Holly hunt are perfect as the roles of Mr incredible and elastigirl respectively, I love the reverse roles they are put in this film and how their characters deal with certain situations is just so fitting of their characters. The rest of the family are back and Jack jack steals the show in this film as he starts to discover his powers and it is just hilarious to watch. Dash and violet are fun in the roles given to them but they fade into the background at times in this film. Samuel l Jackson reprises his role as frozone and he isn't in this film as much as you want him to be but he is great when he is on screen. The villain though doesn't provide much intrigue to me and I feel like they weren't an important part of this film. The story is interesting and deals with some themes that are pretty mature and seemingly reacting to the huge explosion of superhero films in the media today. However, the biggest negative in this film is the plot twist involving the villain. I predicted the twist straight away and it didn't come across particularly well at all. The script has the likeable humour from the first film and some great drama that adds to the complexity of these heroes and there lifestyles. The style of the film has some great action set pieces involved that really grew in stature as the film progresses. Also this film moves quickly and flows really well to keep you interested throughout. Overall this is a fantastic sequel that is worthy of the wait and definitely worth a watch.",9,1,3,23 July 2018
Spectre," A great fourth installment
","Finally spectre is out in the UK and I have seen it, and I will tell you that this film does not disappoint. The premise of the film sees bond looking for a secret organisation linked to his past. Meanwhile M tries to deal with problems in London with mi5. Daniel Craig is great as James bond and he is at his best in this film. He really does a great job of providing a rough damaged bond but he is a ladies man and actually pretty funny in this film. I thought he did a great job in this film and has really developed well in the role. Christoph waltz plays the villain in this film and even though he is not in the film a huge deal I thought he did a really good job. His character was perfect for the film and really worked well opposite Craig. Ralph fiennes plays the new M and I thought he did a really good job in this film, he brought great charisma to his character and was a great fun addition to the main cast. Lea seydoux plays the bond girl in this film and she was pretty good in this film as she was more then your average bond girl and had some character depth to her. She had good chemistry with Craig as well and her character worked well in the story. A fun character was Dave bautista as he plays the evil henchman and it worked for the film. The story of the bond storyline really works in this movie and I thought the more personal storyline really worked for this film. However, the secondary plot involving mi5 and mi6 just didn't really interest me that much and I could have done without it honestly. The script was a huge surprise to me, there was quite a bit of humour and it worked for me in this film. The drama was all dealt with really well as well. The style of the action scenes were great and all of them are hard hitting and exciting. However, this film just like casino royale has a few pacing issues towards the middle of the film and it does mean there is a lull in the film. Overall I really enjoyed this film and it is a great action film.",8,16,38,26 October 2015
Joy," A below average generic movie
",I missed this film when it came out but now I have had the chance to watch joy and I think this film is a pretty huge disappointment. The premise of this film sees a woman attempt to follow her dream to make her invention a success. Jennifer Lawrence plays joy in this film and she is clearly the best part of this film. She has strength to her character but also a vulnerability to her that does make her an interesting character. Robert deniro plays joy's father in this film and he does a decent job but his character is just really unlikeable in this film to an extreme degree. Bradley cooper is in this film a bit and he does a very good job showing his charisma but he just isn't in the film enough. The rest of the characters are all incredibly dull and you will not care about anybody in this film other then joy. The story is as generic as possible with there being nothing unique in this film. Also the film tries to follow so many story arcs that it gives none of them any depth at all. The script actually has some decent humour in it but the drama just falls flat when it really wants to make you care. The style of this film is also generic and doesn't do anything to make you interested in this film and actually leaves you pretty bored. Overall this film has a few decent performances but isn't worth watching.,4,0,2,4 November 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," A fantastic feel good film
","This is one of the most talked about films in recent memory and I think it is fantastic. The premise of the film is that a young Mumbai teen is one question away from winning the jackpot on a game show until he is accused of cheating. To prove his innocence he explains his hard upbringing. Dev Patel plays Jamal the lead, he is an actor I have always liked but he has never been better then this film. He was your true underdog but you connected with his character and you root for him all the way through the film. His romance is also really good in the film and their chemistry works for the film and you are really roofing for these two to succeed. Jamal's brother salim was a really interesting character in the film and even though he is the antagonist I liked his character development. A big shout out has to go out to the young kids in the film as they really do a great job in this film. The story was really interesting, the use if flashbacks gives further development to the characters and really invests you in this underdog story and its romance. The script is OK, there is some dialogue but I guess the overuse of Hindi didn't help at all. Also the script lacks humour quite a bit of the film but the TV parts are written superbly. The style is the best thing about this film. This is one of the best films for its style that I've ever seen. The editing is very fast paced but well done so you know what's going on. Also all the vibrant colours and soundtrack make you feel apart of the world. Overall this is a fantastic movie that deserves all the praise it gets.",9,1,2,6 September 2015
The Nice Guys," A great entertaining buddy cop film
","I heard good reviews for this film so I went see it and I was very entertained by this fun movie. The premise sees two different personal investigators on the hunt for a girl who has gone missing. Russel crowe and ryan gosling are the two pi's in this film and they are both great in this film. They have such good chemistry on screen together and even though it's pretty cliché you buy there friendship on screen. Also both of them are interesting and funny characters in there own right which helps boost this film. Also goslings daughter in this film is amazing, she gives a performance way beyond her years by providing some great humour and drama so I hope to see her in more things in the future. Unfortunately, everybody else in this film is wasted. All the villains are boring and have absolutely no character to them even though seeing keith David is always cool. Kim basinger is only in this film for a few scenes which is such a waste of her talent. The story is a bit convoluted but it works because it is always moving, the story keeps evolving and you are on this journey with the two guys and its pure fun. The script is really good with all the witty banter between the two being funny and when it needs to be the film hits the drama levels well. The style has some great action scenes that were filmed very well. Also the 1970s feel really works for the stylistic nature of the film. But, I do feel like the film has a few pacing issues especially in the first 30 mins and is probably a tiny bit too long. But I really enjoyed this film and think it is definitely worth a watch.",8,3,7,7 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A fantastic action film that is a great watch
","I have finally got the chance to see the much acclaimed new mad max film fury road and I must say that it is fantastic. The premise of this film sees max get kidnapped by a warlord and tries to escape with a group of refugees. Tom hardy plays mad max and he is great in the role, he doesn't have allot of lines but I see that as being true to the mad max character and he nailed all the action scenes that he had to do. Another great character is that of Charlize Therons character of furiosa, she was an interesting character and she was an even better fighter then mad max which made her the real star in this film in my opinion. Nicholas hoult plays a crazy in this film and this is really unlike anything he has ever played before, he was crazy as you expect but he was also a really interesting character and his development throughout the film was one of the best things in this movie. The villain immortal Joe also had some character to him and was cool even though I do wish they gave him a little bit more to do. The narrative is simple yes but it works and the character development really is good in this film and makes these characters really interesting and fun to watch. The script is the one negative as some of the dialogue feels one dimensional and doesn't hit the emotional impact that would make the characters really stand out, but there are some fun and emotional dialogue that does help. The style is fantastic, this film is crazy but it makes sense in this film and makes it great. The action is all insanely cool and is easily the best part of this film and the use of practical effects mixed with cgi really worked and makes all the stunts look fantastic. Overall this is a fantastic film and if you are looking for an action film to watch this is one of the best around.",9,3,11,1 July 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," An Epic war film that hits you emotionally
","I have heard great things about Hacksaw Ridge and this has been a film i have been anticipating for a while and it ends up that it is absolutely brilliant. The premise of the film is set in WW2 and sees a man join the army as a medic but he vows that he can never use or even hold a gun which creates problems for him. It seems to be a great start to 2017 for Andrew Garfield as after Silence he is even better in this film with his best ever performance in this film. He is such a good person in this film and you really care about his character as you really want to see him succeed. I was rooting for him from the first minute of the film to the last minute and i believe he may even win the Oscar for this performance. Hugo Weaving plays his father in this film and he is is immense in this film, we are used to seeing him in confident roles in blockbusters it is so interesting seeing this drunk abusive father that doesn't understand his son's wishes to go to war because of his past experiences. Teresa Palmer plays the romantic interest for Garfield in this film and she gives her best ever performance in this film and they have great chemistry in this film. you buy there romance and you really care about there relationship as the film progresses and you see it drive Garfield throughout the film. Vince Vaughan, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey are all in this film with Vaughan as the drill sergeant and he brings his comedic chops to the roll but also a great dramatic performance that i haven't seen from him before. Also Bracey and Worthington aren't known for giving great performances but this film is different as they both are brilliant in this film and you end up really caring about them in this film. The story of this film has really two halves, the first half seeing him building his romantic relationship and deal with the other soldiers and his beliefs. The second half sees the war events in the film that really hits you hard. It is fascinating to watch this guy stay true to his beliefs and as the film progresses you really believe in him and i think the fact that this is a true story makes it an even more emotional story. also for those worrying about this film heavily pushing religion, it really doesn't and it is just another small thing in the film that is used very well. The script has great dialogue in it whether dramatic or humorous really helps add to these characters and your love for them. The style of the film is great, especially when the film starts showing all the war scenes in the film. The Brutality of the film is well shown and it doesn't glorify the war element but shows it as a horrific event that you really shouldn't enjoy. also the sound effects are great and i really felt every shot that was fired in this film. overall this is one of the best war films ever made and I recommend that everybody sees it to appreciate it.",10,2,8,2 February 2017
Warcraft," The first great video game movie
","I have been excited for this film since the first trailer and even after the poor reviews I still was hyped for it and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of this film sees the orcs leave there homeworld to try and survive which causes conflict with the humans of azaroth. Travis fimell plays lothar the main human and he delivers a decent performance that makes you care about him. He has charisma to him and depth to his character as he tries to stop his world from being destroyed. Tobby kebbell plays durotan, the main orc chief who wants to see his people to survive without war with the humans. I liked his character because he goes against the typical orc because you can tell that he has depth to his personality over just wanting war. Ben foster plays the guardian of humanity and he does a great job, his character had awesome powers and his character developed throughout the film. Paula patton plays garona and she really delivered a good performance from a character who really thrived In this film as more then just a simple romance. Dominic cooper plays the king and even though he doesn't have loads to do I thought he did a pretty good job in this film. All the orc characters were interesting and it is done well enough to make you care about the orcs. The story has some decent drama to it on both sides that made both sides interesting and compelling. However, I would have liked to have seen more interaction between the two sides as at times it does feel like that the two stories are quite disconnected which hurts the overall story. The script has some great drama in it with the individual stories developing well. However, this film does lack any real humour in it which is disappointing for a film like this. The style is pretty breathtaking with all the cgi being seem less and making the action scenes flow very well. Overall this film is a great time that should be seen.",8,0,0,2 June 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An improvement but still not as good as the original
","It seems that with the universal hate for the transformers franchise it seems that people ignore the positives that there is with these Transformers film. This film starts with Sam being distraught with his lack of relationship with Optimus Prime and the autobots and having to deal with real life, until the decepticons return and Sam, his new girlfriend Carly and the autobots need to face a new but familiar foe. This film in my opinion is co-led by Sam and Optimus Prime and I like both, Sam is seemingly sympathetic in this film and we are meant to feel for his situation, whereas Optimus Prime is just a total badass and when he is destroying enemies it really is truly enthralling. Also the side characters are pretty good with Carly in my opinion being a huge improvement from Megan Fox in the other films. Bumblebee is a great character who just like Optimus reflects the great characters that these alien autobots are. Also Sentinel Prime is a good new deep character and even in his smaller role Megatron is still cool. Now in true Michael Bay style the story is not very good and these films are not great stories at all, similar is the script which has always been cheesy and this is no different and these things need to be improved in future Transformer films. The one great thing about Transformers films is the style as it is always awesome and the last hour is just a visual epic like I expect from a Transformers film. If it can improve it's story and script the future of these films can improve significantly.",6,0,1,30 June 2014
Macbeth," À good retelling of Shakespeares play
","After seeing the trailer for Macbeth I really wanted to see it and I must say that I did enjoy this film. The premise of this film follows the Shakespeare play where Macbeth convinced by his wife commits a crime to become king of Scotland as they both slowly start to lose their mind. I love Michael fassbender as he was truly great in this film. He did a great job of selling the humanity of Macbeth which ends up becoming a lack of humanity from Macbeth and you really buy it. Marion cottilard plays lady Macbeth and I thought she did a pretty good job, I didn't care about her character as much as fassbender and I thought she wasn't as strong as I wanted her to be. The rest of the supporting cast didn't really stand out at all which was a disappointment considering macduff and banquo in particular are big characters for the plot. The story is good as it truly shows how one act of greed can change a person and you see Macbeth slowly transition into madness. However, as I said before I don't believe they gave the character of lady Macbeth enough to do and enough of a reason to care about her story. The script is the big talking point in this film because it is all in the old Shakespearean English and at times it is really hard to understand what people are saying. However, in some of the more dramatic scenes I thought it worked pretty well. The style of this film is beautiful, all the cinematography was great and the action scenes felt very heavy hitting. Overall I enjoyed this film and if you have any interest in the source material then you should see this film.",7,3,10,14 October 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," arguably the greatest of indiana jones stories
","It is always debated whether raiders of the lost ark or the last crusade is the best Indiana Jones film and I must say they are both excellent and it is hard to tell. This adventure sees indy, Dr Elsa Schneider, salah and Marcus Brody looking for Indy's father and also beat the Nazis to finding the holy grail. Harrison ford is once again utterly fantastic as Indiana Jones and this film is the one in my opinion that solidifies him as one of the greatest characters in film history. A big problem for me with the previous film was the weak supporting cast but have no fear because this film has an excellent supporting cast. Sean Connery is superb as Indy's dad ans the chemistry the two have is phenomenal and really carries this film. Also returning from raiders was Marcus Brody and salah given bigger roles and they both succeed in providing great moments and bring a good sense of comic relief needed for the film. The new love interest Elsa was also really good and her chemistry with Indy was also decent and was much better then the previous romance in temple of doom. The story is great too with the father son bonding done really well mixed with the search for the holy grail makes this story riveting and ridiculously entertaining. Overalls the script is awesome with the exchanges between Indy and his father being enough they also provided the other characters with great dialogue and back stories. The style is back to form with obviously the legendary theme, whip and hat being intact but also the reintroduction of the Nazis was a great decision as I always believe Indiana Jones is always more fun when fighting the Nazis. Overall this is an epic film and one that I can watch over and over again.",10,2,3,21 September 2014
Back to the Future," An epic fun sci fi adventure
","I have finally had the chance to review back to the future which is definitely one of my favourite films of all time. The premise of this film sees a teenager sent from the year 1985 to 1955 by accident and make sure his parents reunite. Michael j fox is absolutely fantastic as marty, he was so lovable as the character and just straight away you want to like marty. He has allot of charisma to him that makes you truly care about his situation. Christopher Lloyds performance as doc brown is pretty iconic and he is great in this film. He is a really funny character that is very charismatic, plus his chemistry with fox is brilliant. All the rest of the characters are great, whether its the bully biff or the younger versions of martys parents they all do a great job. The story is great with the time travelling aspect being really fun and enjoyable but also brings about allot of drama from it. The script has some great humour and some good drama in it that makes it a truly great movie. The style is very fast paced which totally works for this film. The effects look great especially considering the film is 31 years old. Overall this film is a must see and one of the greatest films ever.",10,2,2,2 March 2016
The Bourne Supremacy," great sequel to action series
","For starts if you haven't seen The Bourne Identity then do not see this film until you have seen the first film because you won't have an idea of what is going on. This movie is much more action packed then the first one with the authorities from around the world looking to capture Jason Bourne because he is framed for a crime he didn't commit. From the beginning of this film it is clear that Bourne's isolation is a main premise for this sequel whereas introducing Bourne to the audience, however, this film is adding to the character. A positive addition to this film is the character Kirill played by the awesome Karl Urban. However, he is not in the film enough in my opinion but when he is he sells the fact that he is just like Bourne a deadly killer with no remorse but that idea isn't really explored. Instead the thrill of the chase is what makes this an awesome film and really establishes it as a great action film with this character who really is seen crumbling throughout the film and this makes it just as interesting as the original Bourne Identity.",9,3,3,2 March 2014
The Great Gatsby," Crazily shot movie going experience
","I have read the book 'The Great Gatsby' and thoroughly enjoyed it adding to my anticipation to this film. The majority of the performances in this film are really good especially Toby Maguire as Nick Carraway, Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan and especially the great Leonardo Di Caprio as Jay Gatsby. This character is one we are truly meant to root for and feel like we want him to succeed whereas Buchanan is meant to be a bad guy that we very much dislike against our favourite Gatsby. I also feel without Maguire's solid performance then this film would probably fall apart as he is an essential part of the film as well as Gatsby. However, I felt there was a few issues with this film such as some overacting and overdramatic performances especially from Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan who just felt like this overacted woman. But the main problem sometimes is the craziness of some of the set pieces of this film which sometimes takes away from the narrative of the film even though the party scenes were impressive and the best looking parts of the film. Also I guess knowing the ending of the film did hinder my experience even though it was done very well in my opinion. This film is a true representation of the novel and is great with its story but there is some problems with it and is not perfect but is still very good.",7,1,2,15 March 2014
13 Hours," An Above average war true story
","There has been allot of buzz about this film since it has come out especially considering Michael Bay directed this film and I did enjoy this film though probably not as much as the majority of people did. The premise of this film sees six CIA soldiers having to defend a US embassy from terrorists in Benghazi. John Krasinski plays the lead soldier in this film and I thought he did a really good job, he added depth to his character and gave a powerful performance that managed to rise up his character's clichÃ© story arcs. The rest of the cast does a pretty decent job in this film to add emotional weight to the film., but unfortunately there characters just aren't very interesting and so when the action takes place you don't really care too much about these characters which is a big detriment to the film. The story of this film is pretty intense when the action takes place as you see these guys fighting for there lives against massive odds and it is intense to see. However, the first hour of this film takes allot to get going and you don't really care about the characters as none of the action is taking place. The script in this film has some decent dramatic dialogue and some decent banter between the soldiers in this film. But that traditional Michael Bay awkward humour does take place and it does hurt when it is there but it is nowhere near as bad as the Transformers films. The style of this film when the action is taking place it is great and you are with the characters as they are in this dire situation. However, as mentioned before the first hour of this film is just too slow and mundane for me and the pacing of it just doesn't work for me and really hurt this film. Credit should go to Michael Bay though for at least attempting to make a serious film and doing a pretty decent job with it. Overall if you like war films you probably should give this film a chance i think you might enjoy, otherwise it might be a bit forgettable.",6,0,4,14 February 2017
Sully," A great interesting film
","With tom hanks in a film depicting a true event I was excited to see him hopefully deliver a great performance in an interesting film and I got what I wanted. The premise of this film sees a pilot crash land his plane on the river and saves everyone on the plane. But the plane authorities are looking into if he made the right decision. Tom hanks plays sully the pilot and he is absolutely incredible in this film, he gives such a great performance and you are totally invested in his character. His character is very interesting and you are incredibly sympathetic to the situation h I put in when h just thought he was doing his job. I suspect hanks will be in contention for the Oscar when the time comes. Also giving a fantastic possible Oscar worthy performance is Aaron Eckhart who gives his best performance since the dark knight. Him and hanks have great chemistry together and you buy there friendship as they both try and get through the situation. He also adds allot of humour to this film which was desperately needed to add levity to the characters. Laura linney plays hanks wife and she does a really good job especially when you consider her and hanks have limited screen time together and I fully bought into their relationship and cared about how it develops. The rest of the supporting cast all feel like real people and they add allot of depth to the scenes that don't involve hanks. The story is incredibly interesting as you see this normal guy get overcome by the pressure that he is put under an you see him cracking under this investigation and you really do care. But I felt like this film could have been a little longer to complete some story arcs also this ending is pretty abrupt. The script is fantastic and adds to the humanity of these characters with great dramatic and humorous dialogue that truly helps you care about these people in the film. The style of this film is a bit of a mixed bag, I love all the scenes involving the actual crash as you truly feel the drama that is going on And care about every person that is on the plane. But there are certain aspects of this film just feel out of place such as some flashbacks. Overall though I really enjoyed this film and recommend that everybody sees it that is interested in it.",8,0,1,9 December 2016
Jurassic Park," An Epic Truly Timeless Film
","In preparation for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom I have decided to go back and review the original Jurassic Park trilogy and I have started with the utter classic that is Jurassic Park and it is still truly amazing. The premise of this film sees a couple of experts travel to a theme park to find Dinosaurs that could be the next stage of evolution. The lead of this film is Sam Neil as Dr Alan Grant and he is great in this film, he is charming and charismatic in this role but he also has a really good journey throughout this film. Laura Dern plays his partner in this film and she is really good, she plays more then just your typical damsel in distress and you buy how cool her character is during the film. Though the star of this film is definitely Jeff Goldblum as Dr Ian Malcolm, he oozes charisma and has the best lines in this film to make him one of the most memorable supporting characters of all time. Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond the head of this park and you can see his true passion for this role and it goes to his character as you feel like he does when you see this park. Also a small mention that Samuel L Jackson has a small role in this film and he does a decent job. The story in this film is very simple but also full of larger themes. The first hour of the film doesn't have much action in it but I feel like it brings you into the awe of this world and sucks you into this universe. Then when the chaos unfolds you are invested in the characters and the breath-taking and suspenseful moments that make this a film you can't take your eyes off. The script has some very important drama in it that asks plenty of questions about nature vs science and it really interested me. Also the humour really works, especially when delivered by Goldblum because he has a perfect delivery. The style of the film makes this one of the most important films ever made in my opinion. These CGI Dinosaurs look amazing especially when you consider this film came out in 1993 and nothing like this had ever really been done before. Also you have to appreciate the amazing score by the incredible John Williams that transports you into this world and is one of the greatest of all time. The suspenseful scenes kept me invested even though I have seen this film before and deliver on the excitement that I require for a film like this. Overall this film is one of the best films ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it this is a film that must be seen.",10,1,2,20 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," A good but unremarkable mix of alien and aliens
","So after my alien reviews we have now got to alien covenant which I was highly excited for and similar to guardians of the galaxy 2 I enjoyed the film but I wanted it to be better. The premise of the film sees a group of colonists travel to a planet where they are hunted by an alien species. Michael fassbender is back in this film this time as android Walter and he is really good in this film, his American accent is pretty strong in this film but he executes it really well. I also really liked how Davids story was treated in this film and how they progressed his character in this film. Katherine waterson is the female lead in this film and she was pretty good in this film, she doesn't have loads of character development but she gives a pretty decent performance. She has a lot of strength to her character and buy how tough she is when it comes to this situation. Billy crudrup plays the captain of the ship and I actually thought he did a decent job in the film as a guy who has faith that is needed for the situation that this team is in. Danny McBride is in this film in a more serious role then usual and I thought he did a great job in this film I really liked his character and how he truly sold his performance that made him the character with the most emotion to him in in this film. The story in this film does have some really good ties to Prometheus especially and I really loved the expansion of the universe especially with the ending for this film. However, this film isn't really unique at all, even from the description I gave you, you probably have seen plenty of films with a similar premise and this film just really doesn't add anything new or unique in this film which is pretty disappointing. The script for this film has some decent real interactions between our crew that I did like as it felt pretty real and like these people were actually friends. The style of the film has some truly frightening scenes in it, that does make you bite your nails while having some pretty decent action scenes in it as well. But the pacing of this film is a bit off and apart from the ending is pretty predictable as you watch this film go on. Overall this is a pretty decent alien film, but from the trailers I was really hoping for a fantastic film but it doesn't really deliver but it is still a good film probably worth a watch.",7,2,8,13 May 2017
Dodgeball," A fantastic comedy that is one of my favourites
","For a while now I have truly loved this film but I haven't watched it in a while so last night I decided to and in my opinion this is one of the best comedies I have seen and one of my personally favourites. The premise of the film sees a down on its luck gym in danger of being destroyed by its richer competition. So in order to save there gym they enter a dodgeball tournament to raise the money. I have been critical of Vince Vaughan before for being the same character in pretty much all of his comedies but this is the one where it really works. He totally encapsulates his charismatic but underachieving character really well and you do truly root for his character and the situation that he is put in. The supporting cast is also really good, starting with the obvious, Ben stiller absolutely kills it as white Goodman probably giving my favourite performance of his. He is so obnoxious but totally owns it in a way that it really does make it fun to watch his character and truly makes it a memorable performance. Christine Taylor plays Vaughan's love interest in this film but she is a great character in her own right and I thought she gave a fun performance. Rip torn plays patches o hoolihan there coach and he gives such an over the top performance but it works as you watch this crazy old guy drilling these grown men. Justin long and Alan tudyk also give really funny performances in this film, also this film contains one of my favourite Jason Bateman performances. The story is as described in the title an underdog story and I always remain heavily invested in the story of this film as these highly likable people fight against the evil corporation it is good stuff. However, my one issue with this film is its first act isn't that funny and it feels a bit sluggish as they introduce all of these characters one at a time, also yes the story is pretty cliché as well. The script has some gutbusting dialogue in it that always makes me laugh out loud, but it also does a really good job with its more dramatic scenes that as mentioned before makes you care about the characters. The style of the film is pretty raunchy and that could put some people off but I really enjoy it about this film and think it adds top the film. All the dodgeball matches are really well planned and all feel different and unique which is credit to the filmmakers to make that possible. Overall I really do love this film and think if you are a fan of comedies like this then it is a must watch.",9,5,7,8 June 2017
The Martian," An epic space survival film
","The Martian was on my most anticipated list of 2015 and I am so happy to report that this is easily one of the best films of 2015. The premise of the film sees astronaut mark watney stranded on Mars after his crew think he is dead, he has to survive and try to find a way off Mars. Meanwhile, NASA and his crew are trying to find a way to save him. Now matt Damon is an underrated actor in my opinion and he was amazing in this film with one of the best performances of the year. You are rooting for mark watney and you really want to see him survive this ordeal. He was a really funny character as well and delivered a great dramatic performance that could see him get an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is also top quality, chiwetel ejiofor us one of the people on earth trying to save watney and he is great in the role. Michael Peña provided a lot of great humour to the film and was great. Jessica chastain was great, Jeff Daniels was great and Sean bean was especially great. The story is pretty simple but it is so cool seeing Damon trying to survive on Mars and how he uses all his skills to try and make it work. I also loved the relationship he had with his crew even though there barely on screen together. And the NASA stuff on earth was all fascinating to me as you see a group of people try to do good. The script was surprisingly brilliant, there was allot more humour then I expected and it all worked in this film. But also there was a great dramatic quality to this film as there should be. The style is phenomenal, Mars has never looked better and i was blown away by the cinematography of this desolate planet. I also loved the use of suit cams and video logs as a fresh unique way of filming. Overall this film is easily one of my favourites of 2015 and is an absolute must see.",10,13,26,15 October 2015
The Fighter," A fantastic biopic that pulls on the heartstrings
","This is my second biopic in the last few days and even though I thought 42 was a great film I think the fighter is a more complete film and I think this film is fantastic. The film focuses on boxer Mickey ward who is down on his luck and not going anywhere in his boxing career. He is also being held down by his family especially his crack head trainer his brother dicky. Now Mark wahlberg is a decent actor and he does a really good job here, he carries the emotional scenes and I fully believed him as this boxer that just needs the confidence to succeed in life. But show stealer and game changer is Christian bale as dicky in a role that he won an Oscar for. Bale is such a good actor and he fully commits to this role you truly do believe he is this crack head who is messed up in the head. But also I like damaged characters who underneath have a good side to them and Christian bale nailed that part in this film to flawless levels. Amy Adams is really good in this film also, she plays mickeys girlfriend and she wasn't just this girl to look at, she was strong, determined and you see her reasoning for her actions in this film. Melissa Leo is also really good in the film she was an antagonist in the film but she brought allot of sympathy to her character and allot of complex things to her that makes you even kind of like her by the end of the film. The story is great, yes when it comes to the boxing you have seen it all before but it's good stuff and more importantly this film is not about boxing really it is about a relationship between two brothers and a family that is fractured and in that way it succeeds. There are allot of emotional scenes in this movie and they do hit you because of the performances and the story of this film is what makes it so interesting to watch. The script is the only part of the film that is lacking a little bit. The drama is done well and the small bits of humour as well, its just that sometimes it becomes hard to understand people and there are some shouting matches that really don't add anything to the film. The style is really good with it portraying a realistic world that these people live in making you care about them because all of this is the real world. Also all of the boxing scenes were filmed well which is a good thing in your boxing movie. Overall this is a fantastic film where if you can take the drama is definitely worth the watch.",9,0,0,31 July 2015
Furious 7," a good action film that is enjoyable
","I will start this review by saying that this is the first time I have ever seen a full fast and furious movie so I didn't really care to see it that much. But word was buzzing about it so I decided to see it and I must say I enjoyed this film for what it was. Vin diesel, the late Paul walker and the rest of the crew go after the brother of their previous enemy who is looking to hunt them all down. While the US government gets the team to help them locate an item that can track down anybody on the planet. Now vin diesel is the biggest believer in this franchise and he is good in the role as the head of the family and you truly buy his role and you see him as a badass by the end of the film. Obviously allot of the talk was about how the film would cope with the loss of Paul walker and I think for the scenes he was in walker was great and even though occasionally it is obvious when he isn't there I think they did the best they could in a bad situation. I love Jason Statham as an actor and he was great in this movie too as the antagonist even though I do wish we had known more about his character but this film is long enough without it. Michelle Rodriguez was good in the film even though I haven't seen the previous ones I understood her individual story and liked seeing how she progressed throughout the movie as a character. The rock is back as Hobbs and he was great for the small part of the film he is in which sucks because the rock is one of he best things in Hollywood at the moment and they barely used him in this film. Now originally I just thought this was going to be a film where the team has to take down Statham Who is looking for revenge which would have been fine and when we see it it's good stuff. But the problem is that the film adds this completely pointless story about a piece of tech that the good guys don't even need so it comes across as half the The film is pointless really. There are some funny moments in the film with allot of funny dialogue but there is also a lot of cliché to the lines and you just shake your head thinking to yourself that you have heard these a thousand times. The style is a mixed bag, the hand to hand combat and most of the driving action scenes are great but the over the top ridiculous moments just really take me out of the film and make it seem like it is a sci-fi film because none of it could ever happen. I also want to give a shout out to a great tribute to Paul walker which was probably the best part of the film for me. Overall I had fun with fast 7 and even though it has its problems it does a good job at just being a fun film.",7,2,17,4 May 2015
