Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars can only go up from here
","*This review contains minor spoilers*When I first watched The Phantom Menace, I thought it was just okay. I had lowered my expectations before seeing it, and it seemed entertaining. I even bought the DVD over time. Unfortunately, the more I watch it, the less I like it.True, it's mean to pick on the little guy, but Jake Lloyd is quite awful as an actor. I know that some kids do talk with a bland, flat, monotone, but this is just not acceptable for a kid that is supposedly as brilliant as Anakin. The rest of the cast does okay, but the script doesn't really demand much. The only actor that I thought fit the bill perfectly was Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan, which is impressive since Obi Wan is one of the only characters from the original trilogy.The CGI ultimately hurts Phantom Menace. As impressive as they may have been at the time, the effects are actually quite dated now, and it shows. Although intended to give PM a fantastic, mythical look, it ultimately ends up looking cold and plastic. The land-speeder race, one of the movie's key action sequences, seemed dull, unsuspenseful, and artificial, like a video game.Lukas resorts to alien creatures speaking English with absurd accents rather than have them speak different languages. Occasionally it's difficult to understand what the creatures are saying. Generally the accents are annoying, even offensive at times. It's like watching poorly dubbed Japanese animation.The biggest failure of PM is its lack of lovable characters. Lucas tried too hard to make the characters 'cool.' Thus they are all serious, stoic. There is no wiley, smartass Han Solo. There is no hotheaded, naive Luke. There is no wild, yet loyal Chewie. Instead the characters of PM are bland and forgettable. The only colorful characterization is left to the desperate antics of Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar is slapstick to the extreme; you can almost hear the *zing* and *awooga* of Looney Tunes every time 'he-suh' slips and bumbles.The one redeeming point in the movie is the thrilling, well-choreographed light-sabre battles. Darth Maul may have been under-utilized and under-developed but he is built up just enough for the final duel to be climatic. The final three-way sabre duel against Maul is one of the best of all six Star Wars movies. Unfortunately, even that battle has a clunky ending.Overall I give the Phantom Menace 5 / 10. It's worth watching, but its flaws outweigh its virtues, and it's ultimately the weakest of all the Star Wars films.",5,0,1,28 May 2002
Skyfall," Fun Action Movie Dulled by Plot line Absurdities
","There's a lot to like about Skyfall: the entertaining and fairly creative action sequences and the beautifully shot videography. I particularly enjoyed the first third of the movie, which indeed had the look and feel of a traditional Bond film-- a high-speed, globe-trotting, action-packed adventure. I generally have no problem with Daniel Craig's tougher, beefier Bond.However, once we meet the villain, Silva (Javier Bardem), the film is forced to flesh out its plot and things deteriorate quickly. There are numerous plot holes and contrivances in Skyfall, but I'm willing to overlook most of them except the two glaring ones that are central to the movie.Firstly, the movie has an Aha-He(Silva)-planned-it-ALL moment a bit over halfway through the movie. A movie can do this, so long as the plot leading up to this fits. But considering that Skyfall up to that point was a sequence of seemingly arbitrary, fortuitous events, this strains credibility and indicates sloppy, contrived writing.Secondly, Bond hatches a devious, cunning plan to counter Silva in the final Act of the movie. Except it's not devious. It's a horrible, illogical, arbitrary plan, put in place only because the writers wanted to shift the movie's setting. Lazy writing like this only serves to undermine the characters.Skyfall is not a bad movie, but the plot problems make it feel like a 'stupid' movie-- one that was a written for an unthinking audience. I don't require that movies be impeccably realistic, but I do hope that writers take the time to address the most logical and obvious questions that are likely to pop into the viewers head.On a side note, the movie actually seems more chauvinistic than its predecessors. All the female characters are portrayed as unreliable and error-prone, as dependent on male counterparts, or ultimately as mere sex tools. Perhaps this is what the critics were talking about when they raved about Bond getting back to its roots?",5,5,10,9 July 2013
Chinatown," Decent Noir, but not great
","I've been trying to catch up on classics, and 'Chinatown' was available at my local library so why not?To be honest, I wasn't really impressed.  What 'Chinatown' has going for it is good cinematography and a decent cast.  I found the plot disappointing. It was okay, but really not much better than mystery movies coming out of Hollywood today.  Just weave a complicated web of deceit and then slowly unravel it.  It's a tried and true formula, and I don't think that 'Chinatown' did it particularly better or different.I know I could get flamed for this, but I didn't really appreciate the harsh treatment of the Chinese in this movie.  Most of the recurring Chinese characters are menial servants, and of course Chinatown itself is a metaphor for the scum of humanity.  Now I know that most Chinatowns are or were at some point the red-light districts for their respective metro areas, but, 'Forget it, it's Chinatown.'  Can you blame an Asian for being slightly offended by this flick?****Spoiler****Finally I didn't particularly enjoy the sleezy, pedophilic twist towards the end regarding the incestuous nature of Cross and Katherine.  Perhaps my perspective is affected by my knowing that Polanski himself was charged with raping a minor and consequently fled the U.S.  To me, this taints the movie and makes me feel that this particular plot twist was more than just a step to move the plot on.***end Spoiler ***Overall, I give Chinatown a 6/10.  It has great style but average substance, and in my mind it doesn't stand the test of time.   It wouldn't make my top 100.",6,8,16,16 January 2003
Citizen Kane," Exceeded my expectations, but still overrated
","I picked up Citizen Kane from the library with a preconceived critical attitude.  I had heard, from other young'ns (I'm currently 25), that Citizen Kane is an overrated film thats greatness depends entirely on the context within which it was originally made; it's a landmark in cinematography and film technique, but the plot is lousy and the movie is overall dull.  Its fanbase is mostly crusty old people or young people who want to appear cultured to the aforementioned crusty old people.  I wanted to see for myself: Does Citizen Kane stand the test of time?Having finally watched it, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the plot. It was not exactly gripping, and certainly not original by today's standards.  But it was interesting to me and it does pose a number of questions for pondering.What would you do if you had all the money in the world?  What exactly is it that you want in life?  What do you want to achieve in life, and more importantly, why?  Do you want the right things for the wrong reasons?  Is who you claim to love more a reflection of yourself than the 'loved' person? Are you going through life with a chip on your shoulder, with something to prove, that affects everything you do and every decision you make?Nevertheless, an okay plot and groundbreaking cinematography alone can't carry a movie.  In general I felt the acting was average, occasionally bad. Likewise, the script had its memorable lines, but then again at times was downright corny, even campy.  In general the characters feel distant and impersonal, like you're reading about them in the paper instead of watching them in a movie.When I think of a great film, films that are on my top-20 list, I think primarily of films that I would enjoy seeing over and over.  I think of films that have scenes that I never tire of.  I think of movies that draw you in, connect with you, and leave an impact.  Frankly, Citizen Kane is not one of these films.  I'm glad I finally saw it, but I won't be rushing to buy the DVD for my collection.  It might, just maybe, make my top-50 list, but certainly not my top 20.I think that movie organizations such as AFI ought to have two seperate rankings.  There are the 'Greatest Movies,' and THEN there should also be the 'Most Significant Movies.'  Citizen Kane would be listed highly in this most-significant list.  It would also be in the 'Greatest' list, but not nearly as high.  It's just not very entertaining.All in all, in IMDB, where I rate the overall 'greatness' of a movie, I give it a 7 / 10.",6,2,7,30 January 2003
Shaun of the Dead," Just didn't click with me
","I was really looking forward to enjoying a quirky, English comedy but from start to finish I just could not get into Shaun of the Dead.It should be noted that I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies. The genre has always seemed to focus on gore, effects, and thrills over plot and innovation. But I didn't think this would be an issue since Shaun is a spoof.But it's not a spoof. Or at least not entirely a spoof. Shaun is a conglomeration of spoof, satire, horror, thriller, fantasy, romance, and of course comedy. Very rarely do I enjoy movies that attempt to bridge more than three genres simultaneously. The only similar movie I can recall for comparison is Mars Attacks! (1996).I had some laughs, but overall I could not slip into the proper mindset to enjoy this film even though I desperately wanted to. At times it was clever and creative by placing average Joes in bizarre zombie situations. But at the same time it suffers from all those traits that infuriate and annoy me in horror and thriller movies.In short the primary problem was an inability to empathize with the characters. One reason I don't care for horror movies is because the main characters are generally morons. Shaun himself was no exception; he repeatedly makes poor choices and either under or over reacts to all sorts of situations. His mother is a cross between senile and dim-witted. Ed is borderline retarded.Truthfully, in real life, I can't stand people like Shaun. They are so absorbed in their own problems that they are completely oblivious to their surroundings and events around them. They have no one to blame but themselves for their predicaments. The characters just don't seem to behave realistically, which would be fine if the movie was an outright satire sketch like Monty Python, but it's not.All in all, I give Shaun of the Dead a 6 / 10, still worth a watch.",6,46,81,31 May 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Safe, family fun
","I don't really see what the big deal was about this movie. It starts out promising, but I was pretty bored throughout the last 40 minutes.I will admit that all sets, props, and costumes were done with painstaking detail. The pirates are a colorful, entertaining lot. Acting was okay; Depp was amusing, and fake-Winona was nice eye candy. There are some wickedly funny moments, but plenty of stale one-liners and repeat gags as well. They are the kind of cheap shots at humor that can be sure to have the audience rolling on the floor as long as the movie has already roped them in by then.The ending is naturally cheesy and draws out for way too long. Although not as bad as some, Pirates still had plenty of plot holes for a party pooper like myself to pick at.***SPOILERS***<ul><li>when one ship boards another, as the English did when chasing Sparrow and Turner, do they really send EVERY SINGLE PERSON over to the other ship? Wouldn't it make sense to keep at least a handful of people on your own ship?</li></ul><ul><li>Why did Sparrow steal a coin from the trunk near the end of the movie? In the end, it just needs to be tossed back in anyway. Was it just so that he could whip it out for drama's sake? 'Ah ha! I stole this coin!'</li></ul><ul><li>If Sparrow had been under the curse the whole time, then wouldn't he also suffer from the lack of sensory pleasure? He certainly still enjoyed rum.</li></ul><ul><li>I had thought that the heroes would break the curse right as the pirates were walking along the bottom of the sea (a very neat scene, by the way). They would have all instantly become mortal and then immediately drown. I was disappointed when they instead waited another 30 minutes, let the ghost pirates kill several dozen people first, fought the immortal pirates themselves for another 10 minutes, and THEN broke the curse. A blown opportunity for a neat ending.</li></ul>***END SPOILERS***The special effects were good, but that's not enough nowadays to carry a movie.I was trying to figure out how this movie pulled off an IMDb 8 out of 10. Here's my theory: the promotions for Pirates successfully scared off the vast majority of would-be critics. The trailers and ads had Disney and BRUCKENHEIMER splashed all over, and that was enough to insure that only the sure-sells would actually pay to see it in a theater. I am predicting that Pirates will not age very well, and the rating will slip over time down to about 7.Overall, I give Pirates a 6 / 10: worth seeing at least once. Perhaps I am outgrowing the action, adventure genre.",6,0,1,28 July 2003
The Mummy," Dumb plot, but entertaining
","Overall, the plot is weak, and the action isn't even that great.  The cast does an adequate job considering the shallowness of the script.However, I would have given The Mummy worse ratings were it not for the special effects.  The effects were superb for the time it was released in theatres, and they're still pretty good now.  The effects alone justify giving The Mummy a watch.  If you see the DVD version, check out the cool features on the computer animation.  I'll probably go see the sequel in theatres, at the very least to see the advance in graphic technology.I'm curious about the degree to which the movie makers botched the history and mythology of Egypt.",6,0,0,13 April 2001
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Lord of the Crouching Hellboy Hidden X-Men in Black
","Hellboy II: The Golden Army will please fans of the first by continuing its nice visuals, colorful characters, and decent action sequences. Otherwise, the film doesn't break much new ground and hurts itself with somewhat unorganized plot lines.In HB II, the Prince of a hidden race of elves seeks a magical crown that will enable him to command an army of mechanical soldiers with which to conquer mankind. Hellboy, with his pals Abe and Liz and newcomer Johann Krauss, must aid the elf Princess to thwart his dastardly plan.This is a decent core plot for an action movie, but I could do without the multitude of subplots that clutter the film between shots. Thematically, this movie is all over the place. Here is a sampling of the themes that HB II touches upon: authority and discipline, love and family, personal sacrifice, prejudice and racism, environmentalism and conservationism. Yikes! That's a lot for one movie, let alone an action movie. Some of those are touched upon for literally one or two minutes and then never mentioned or resolved again. HB II almost feels like one issue of a series to be continued later-- which is perfectly understandable considering the source material, but a movie really should be edited to be free standing.Also, many scenes in HB II very distinctly feel like other movies. At times, you will feel like you are watching a chapter from: Men in Black, X-men, Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, most of Jet Li's movies.Speaking of Jet Li, HB II continues the slightly annoying trend of making random characters and creatures into kung-fu martial artists, like the shaolin vampires in the Blade series. Sure, del Toro's version of 'elves' is entitled to his own interpretation, but it still feels slapped on and pandering, sort of like how so many movies try to captivate their western audiences with a generous helping of ninjas.HB II's great strength is in its nicely styled visuals. If you are a fan of del Toro's works or other films with a mythical yet modern look (ie The 5th Element), then you should enjoy the settings and creatures del Toro presents in HB II.All in all, I give Hellboy II a 6. It could have used some editing, but it's definitely worth watching.",6,2,3,7 January 2010
Cloverfield," Like totally SWEEET! 12 stars out of 10!!
","I gotta admit, man, when I saw those ads, I was all like dude this is gonna RAAWK! And my bro Fiz was like 'its all whacked!' and I was like 'No fool! this is for real!' And then their were these leaked clips on the Net and I was like: man, they didn't want us to see these leaked clips but now i seen them and I gotta see this movie cuz it's gonna BLOW my mind and Totally RAWWK!! Anyway, the movie was all about ROb and his bro and New York and the monster. Like Rob starts out with Beth, but at dis party Beth is with Ben, who doesn't like ROb and Rob doesn't like him, but Rob is going to Japan and Rob still likes Beth but so, I felt so like I could relate to Rob and Beth. And Hud and Rob's bro's girl. I so cared for them. They were SUCH great characters. Really profund people. Like me.And then the MONSTER attacks and man is it WICKED!! He smashes everything and the ARMY comes to in to waste him and they can't cuz he RAWKS! And ROb is like, we gotta save Beth and the others are like no we can't. And Rob is like YES we IS.And then the chick Marlena who Hud likes (Hud is the one with the camera(and he is like serious friends with Rob (Hud is like so funny, man, because he's like slow and dumb!))) Anyway, Marlena is attacked by a monster spider and is bitten by the spider monster and she totally completely EXPLODES! When I saw that, I stood up and was all like 'AW YEA!' until the peeps behind told me to sit down and shut up.Anyway, the movie is filmed with a hand-held cam, just like I have for Youtube and the Internet! It's SOO real and new and I feel like I can relate because I am part of the Youtube generation, and I'm all like, yea that could be me in the movie-- they are just like ME. The WHOLE TIME we're all like, what is going' on?--this is SO COOL! It was just plain hands down AWESOME!! And for those of you all sayin that this is just like Blair Witch movie, you're DEAD WRONG, man!! Blair Witch was Completely different. Blair Witch was about a witch. Cloverfield is about a MONSTER! Blair witch was in the woods, which is not New York city, except for the part where they are in Central Park which is sorta like the woods except fewer trees.My only downfall was like how it was only 85 minutes long. They could of got like at least 3 hours more of this. An I have no idea what the monster really was.So anyway, here's the deal: THIS movie RAWKS and I would definitely recommend it. If yur a cool dude like me (YEA!) and you dig EXTREME flicks, then you'll Definitely love Cloverfield. 12 stars out of 10 stars, man!",4,1,2,21 November 2008
Sleepy Hollow," beautifully done
","I can't think of anyone better than Tim Burton to do this movie.  No one can create moods and atmosphere in a rich, fantasy realm like Burton. 
All in all, Sleepy Hollow was a great film.  The set is exquisite.  Depp is lovable and hilarious as an intelligent, goofy, somewhat arrogant Ichabod. Altogether, everything comes together to make a great action/horror/comedy flick.Viewers should be advised, however, that the plot is actually quite thick. You have to really watch for details to keep up with the mystery plot. This can be difficult to do with so many other distractions in the movie.",7,0,1,7 May 2001
Crash," An insightful and honest commentary about the current state of racism in America
","I thoroughly enjoyed Crash because its perspective on life closely parallels my own.We bounce around like pinballs, colliding with one another and very frequently doling out injustice to each another. Every now and then through bizarre coincidence, we have the fortune, or misfortune, of colliding with someone from a previous encounter. There are several ways to handle this. If the other person was someone you previously wronged, then you can either flee and avoid further confrontation, or you can try to make amends. If the other person previously injured you, you may try to turn your cheek and forgive, but it's all the more tempting to seek retribution which results in harm greater than what you had suffered; thus conflicts escalate and negative energy builds like a snowball rolling down a hill growing into an avalanche towards some hapless victim at the bottom.However, most likely you'll hardly ever strike the same person twice in a large city. Instead each encounter will be fresh to you. But each pinball carries with it the weight of prior negative, and positive, collisions. A person in a foul mood from an earlier rude encounter or bitter at being wronged by a person of another race or culture, may lash out at you instead. And hence the cycle continues.This is further exacerbated by the prevalence of cars in our society. Hiding behind 'metal and glass,' we can drive rudely, cut off others, run people off the road, with the safety of anonymity and instant escape (ironically, this specific point was not explored in depth in the movie).Crash reminds us that the world we live in may be smaller than we think. Maybe you did nothing to incur the irrational wrath of a stranger, but what if someone you know did? You may escape the consequences of an injury you inflict on a stranger, but what if that angry person proceeds to injure someone you know? Does it matter at all how far removed you are from the ultimate result? Crash also reminds us how easy it is to succumb to anger, bitterness, and abuse of power. People are frail, vulnerable and imperfect, but with conscious and vigilant fortitude, they can overcome the negative tendencies of human nature. Crash reminds us that though it's not easy, you can attempt to mitigate and relieve the suffering, injustice, and pent-up bitterness with patience, courage, and understanding.Crash is a must-see movie for everyone.",8,1,7,1 March 2006
Blade II," Guess I always like the first one more
","Blade 1 had just the right amount of action, horror, gore, paper-thin plot, and cinematic style to create a movie that was entertaining for the masses yet still get some nods from weathered movie critics.  Blade II takes this balance and goes over the top, using outlandish fight-scenes, loads of CGI, plenty of blood-dripping, gut-mashing gore, and even a bit more expletive language in the script.For a movie of this genre, the plot is needlessly complicated and drawn out, and there are a number of pointless plot twists thrown in towards the end. In the first movie, Blade made vampires look sadder than storm troopers, so new baddies were needed for the sequel.  Enter the reapers: vampire vampires that resemble the mutant love children of Nosferatu, Quasimodo, and Alien. So Blade teams up with the good vampires to fight the bad vampires. Sounds simple enough, right?  So why does it take over 2 hours to get through all the but-kicking?  It seems that lately there have been a number of action movies that have aspirations to be epic dramas.This is an extremely violent and gorey film.  'Black Mask' comes to mind as a movie on par with Blade II on the violentometer.  Blade II features numerous disemboweling, dismemberment, and mutilation scenes.  The action scenes and fight sequences are fairly typical, though many are shot closer than I prefer similar to the confused fight scenes of Batman and Robin. Also, if you ever come face to face with a zombie, mummy, undead, ghoul, vampire, reaper etc... watch out!  Forget crosses, silver, or holy water. All monsters in this post-Matrix age are highly trained in Tae-Kwon-Jiu-Jit-Fu, WWF-style.It wasn't all bad.  The movie succeeds as a thriller, making you jump at times.  The special ops vampire unit is an interesting lot, though none of them are developed enough for the audience to get attached.  Too bad Donnie Yen's talent was wasted.  If you're going to use a stereotypical Asian, sword-wielding, samurai character, then dangit at least let him kick a lot of but!So in short, if you are a big fan of gorefest movies  (ie the type who grew up reading Fangoria), then Blade II will not disappoint.  If you like your movies to be a little more, or at least know their bounds and not pass them, then I would steer clear of Blade II.  My final rating is 5 / 10 (watchable, but mostly forgettable).",5,2,5,23 March 2002
Glory," Holy cow this movie is good
","Historical movies are always to be viewed with an especially critical eye towards details and accuracy. Glory stands out as a moving yet faithful rendition of an incredible tale from American history. The first time I saw this movie, I had no idea what the movie was about or how it ended. I was deeply moved, and today Glory remains one of those movies that I could rewatch over and over.This movie inspired me to read more about the Civil War. I've also read a little more specifically about the Massachusetts 54th. Other reviews have been quick to point out some historical inaccuracies, but most of these glitches are minor and insignificant. For example, the final charge came from the South, not North, as depicted... but with something tiny like that, who cares?This movie inspires and moves. The details of the screenplay and set are well done. The action and special effects are exciting and absorbing. It's also noteworthy that Glory has one of the most stirring, well suited, well choreographed, and independently enjoyable soundtracks. Broderick, Elwes, Denzel, Freeman, and the rest of the talented cast are outstanding. Even the plot and script are worthy. All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough.As a sidenote, if you enjoyed Glory, go visit the 54th Mass. monument on Boston Common.",10,0,0,31 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas is a Genius!
","By making Episode I horrendous, Lucas was able to lower the bar enough that Episode II HAD to be an improvement; and yet Attack of the Clones still left plenty of room for the series to peak in Episode III (2005).And indeed Episode II is much better than The Phantom Menace.  Just not by a lot.First the plot.  Attack of the Clones has a deliberate method of storytelling that I don't recall in the original trilogy.  For example, before Amidala's remark that she heard Anakin having a nightmare, the audience must first be presented with a scene showing him groaning and moaning in bed.  It's like connect-the-dots where the dots are lettered and numbered and there's a dot every centimeter.  It occasionally feels patronizing, as if Lucas assumed the audience consists of 2nd graders.And yet there were other times when I wished that Lucas had done more with certain scenes.  For example, I wished he had extended Anakin's rampage against the Sandpeople; it would've offered thrilling entertainment and even some characterization.The romance was quite hokey, and the script was generally forgettable. George Lucas knows how to make great star battles, but he knows JACK about romance, and boy does it show.  The scenes between Anakin and Padme come off as cliched and awkward.  I honestly think that Lucas should have tried a touch of of romantic comedy in the Anakin-Padme scenes.Speaking of Anakin, Hayden Christenson is a much better actor than Jake Lloyd (he'd better be).  I guess if we are to believe that a child as brilliant as Anakin would speak like a bad actor, then his stale monotone would carry over into adolescence and adulthood as well.
Another problem is the timeframe.  These movies are supposed to take place one generation before the original trilogy.  Yet the sets and props look more high-tech than the value-city toys of Episode IV.  Furthermore, with all the effects they had at their disposal, I'd think they could have done SOMETHING to accommodate the bizarre aging of Anakin and Amidala.  While Portman's character appears to have aged two weeks since Episode I, Anakin has morphed from toddler into full-grown adult, and a tall one at that.Although the CGI was state of the art, it still looks inferior to live action in many respects.  It seems that in the realm of digital effects, animating a rider upon the back of a creature especially poses a challenge. In many scenes featuring riders, the movements were choppy and looked like claymation.  This was the same jerkiness I noticed in Lord of the Rings when a character jumped on top of an animated troll, and again in Harry Potter.But the biggest flaw with the new Star Wars movies is the lack of lovable characters and the chemistry between them.  In the original series, we had the wild, reckless Han Solo, the naive, idealistic, space-redneck Luke, the unwaveringly loyal, always-moaning Chewie, the serious, wise Obi-wan, the slightly snotty yet sensitive Leia, the digital bickering of the two droids, and then we had the wonderful scenes that resulted when their personalities clashed together and mixed into fun, entertaining, dramatic, memorable adventures.Now in the new series, we have Obi-Wan, who is still serious, Anakin, who is supposed to be a wildchild but comes off as forced and serious, Padme, who is generally serious, and a bunch of jedi, who are deadly serious.  You have all these characters standing around being serious, looking 'cool' if you will, and this leaves any humor and color up to the droids, who do their best, and the slapstick antics of Jar-Jar, who thankfully is nearly absent in AoC.  The end result is poor personality development and characters who are mildly interesting, but not particularly lovable or memorable.Like Phantom, the sabre battles again were breath-taking and well-choreographed (or animated).  However, as cool as it was seeing you-know-who kick butt, it still was not executed as well as the show-down between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan.Finally, I thought it was funny how ultimately the entire fall and corruption of the Republic can be traced to Jar Jar Binks.  Did Lucas do this on purpose to appease the Jar Jar haters out there?All in all, I give AoC a 6 / 10, but I do look forward to seeing Episode III.",5,1,2,5 April 2004
Justice League," Zack Snyder does it again
","Imagine you are tasked with creating a superhero team movie. The seemingly obvious way to do this is have your individual heroes meet up and then jump into showing the newly formed team facing obstacles together. Justice League is a case study in why this is actually a terrible way to produce a team-up movie.A better way would be to build up the individual team members, and the relationships between them prior to the actual formation of the team. And if you're already on a tight timeline, because, say, you're trying to catch up to the competition, all the more reason to make good use of whatever few prequels you might have access to. So the fact that Zack Snyder squandered Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman on incoherent action sequences and epic slo-mo glamour shots really takes a toll on the misbegotten Justice League.Furthermore, a good team-up movie isn't really so much about the team facing the world, but rather all the dynamics within the team itself. What little attempt there is to show this in Justice League is equal parts superficial, cliched, and dull.Justice League was already going to be a heavy lift considering all this, but the basic film-making flaws complete the disaster.As with Snyder's other DC movies, the pacing is awful. The script is lifeless and flat. The CGI is absolutely terrible, a problem compounded by its reckless overuse. The action is loud and underwhelming.The low production value of Cyborg is inexcusable in a movie of this scale. He looks like something you might see in a arrowverse spinoff on CW (which in spite of its cheerful cheesiness, produces characters with way more spirit and chemistry than anyone in Snyder's DC-verse). There seemed to be a lot of critical commentary that Ezra Miller's Flash was a rare bright spot in the movie. I have to disagree with that. His character and his lines felt just as forced and predictable as everyone else.Then there is Jason Momoa's Aquaman. All I can say is that I hope the makers of the Aquaman film move away from the lord of the brocean interpretation here.Finally there is the villain, Steppenwolf. Sweet jesus, where to begin with Steppenwolf. Creating a solid villain has always been a challenge for super hero movies, including Marvel films. But it feels like in Steppenwolf, Snyder went out of his way to perfectly model every single complaint about poorly made super villains. I give Justice League a generous 4 / 10. The good news is that its lousy box office performance might force Warner Brothers to reconsider the direction of these movies.",4,1,3,4 May 2018
Grease," Entertaining, but sends the wrong message
","Grease: the ultimate sell-out movie.As entertaining as the dance, song, cheesey sketches, etc. etc. are, the ultimate message of Grease is a bit disturbing.Basically, Sandy completely sells out.

North by Northwest," Good movie but needs some work
","North by Northwest is a fine film, but hey, did you notice that it's over 40 years old?  I say it's due for a good ol' Hollywood remake!  Just think what can be achieved and how much better the movie can be with modern CGI and fresh, young talent.First off, casting is vital.  Cary Grant may have been an uber-stud back in the 50s, but he's way too Ward Cleaver for today's hip audience.  I recommend Will Smith or the Rock.  Replacing Eva Marie Saint would be an accomplished actress like Cameron Diaz or Jessica Simpson.  And for the villainous Vandamm, go with Agent Smith from the Matrix.  Also, I don't know what role they would play, but squeeze DMX and Jet Li in there somehow. Cause I mean, you put those two together and it's like gold every time!Now Hitchcock's plot is involving enough but it might be a bit too slow for today's kids.  Fortunately I have lots of great ideas.  In the drunk car chase scene, replace the pursuers' car with an M1 Abrams tank and instead of a convertible, Thornhill should be in either a hovercraft or a Hummer H2.The scene where Thornhill is being attacked by the cropduster is perfect; just use a stealth fighter instead, have it happen in Times Square, and have Thornhill shoot down the plane with a bazooka; oh, and it should be done all in slow-mo.  Finally, the last scene should end with Mt. Rushmore exploding as Thornhill/Kendall jump off the top screaming 'COWABUNGA TO THE EXTREME, YO!'But otherwise the movie is perfect as is!  Well except for the soundtrack, but I have plans for that too...",7,0,11,5 November 2003
The Patriot," bad, bad movie, but you'll probably like it
","My first comment blasted The Patriot so hard that the comment was rejected by IMDB.All I'll say this time is that it's movies like this that EMBARRASS me as an American.  It's movies like this that make citizens of other nations wonder just how big-headed Americans are.  Once you strip away all the explosions and glitz, you'll see what amounts to a cliche-ridden, predictable, cheesey, braveheart wannabe.  The movie is endlessly biased and historically inaccurate.Nevertheless, I'm definitely a minority here.  Out of the group of about 10 people I went with, I was the only one who truly hated the movie.  The average American will praise this movie as a patriotic inspiration and a historical masterpiece.",3,4,9,19 April 2001
The Fast and the Furious," THIS is how you do summer movies
","If you want plot, script and oscar-winning performances, go rent Shawshank Redemption or something.Honestly, I don't know why some people have come down so hard on this movie. It's like saying, 'Airplane' was dumb because the characters were poorly developed and shallow, and the plot was unrealistic.'The Fast and the Furious' is a great summer, action flick.  Definitely gets the heart pumping and the adrenaline flowing.  The chase and race scenes have some great stunts.  The cars are gorgeous and fun to watch.  I saw it over a week after it opened, and the audience was still very receptive to the action in this movie.Now this is where I am supposed to slam the plot and the acting.  Well, to be honest, I thought the plot was quite GOOD, given that all they had to work with was the theme of 'street racing.'  I didn't think the acting was all that bad.  The entire cast did fine, given the script they had and the kind of movie it was.  One fatal mistake many action movies try to do is weave in too much drama or emotion, which inevitably ends up looking cheesey and just slows down the movie.  FnF was guilty of this, but only to a small degree.  A brief dive into Vin Diesel's scarred childhood, a little bit of corny romance for Walker, but that's it.  I respect a movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to cross any lines.The movie makers set out to make a movie that presents Import Racing to the masses.  So they had to make a plot to house that movie.  Personally, I think they did a pretty good job.  Definitely worth a go in a theater.PS: I never saw all of Point Break, but from what I did see, it looked dumb. Like an extended Mellow Yellow commercial.",7,2,2,2 July 2001
Independence Day," Deserves its kudos
","Independence Day did great at the box office but has suffered a bit of a backlash over time as its inherent flaws and cheesiness are exposed.Normally I would totally rip into a rah-rah-USA flick like Independence Day. A computer virus being transmitted by a Macintosh to an alien system?  The president hopping into a jet fighter to personally join the battle?  An alcoholic redneck elevated to hero status?  Seeing the final celebration scenes, I wonder if 300 years from now American movies will still portray other nationalities in their basest stereotypes.  (ie happy Africans running around with their spears and loinclothes).Nevertheless, I give ID lots of credit for its initial impact, especially given its most fundamental goal: entertainment.  I remember the first time I saw it in a theater in '96, and I fully admit that my friends and I had a blast.  The action was great, the characters were likable, and even the humor was cute.Plus, ID was one of the first to really effectively use the theme of massive disaster.  The audience was glued to the screen watching New York and Washington get devastated, overwhelmed by the destruction and loss of life. Looking back and seeing all the copycat films of late, it's actually quite emotionally exploitive, but hey, ID gets credit for being one of the first to do it well.All in all, I give Independence Day an imdb 6: worth watching at least once.",6,0,1,7 July 2003
Remember the Titans," cheese, but it's still alright
","It was good and pretty fun.  That's about it.At times, Remember the Titans tries to take a really serious look at the social issues of the era, but it always gets drowned out by good ol', thick, soupy Disney cheesiness.  The movie will hit some pretty tense, serious dilemmas, which are then resolved too simplistically and quickly.  Racist, narrow-minded people suddenly see the errors of their ways and reform their attitudes overnight; then they all hold hands and think happy thoughts.  I don't care to even guess how historically accurate this movie is of the real Titans.In the end, I cannot consider this movie as a serious commentary on society and American history, it though does put forth an honest effort.  Instead, it belongs next to The Mighty Ducks and all those other feel-good, go-team, rah-rah movies.Still, this movie is entertaining and pretty engrossing.  If you like football movies or you just like seeing Denzel get militant, then you'll enjoy Remember the Titans.",6,0,0,5 January 2001
X-Men: The Last Stand," An entertaining chapter, but clearly the weakest
","What if a 'cure' was developed that could permanently remove mutant defects and enhancements? What if we could all fix perceived flaws and differences through modern medicine? And what if a fresh director took over the reigns of the X-men franchise? In X-men: The Last Stand, we at least get an answer to the last question.It's nice to let a new director tackle the franchise, but Rattner clearly cannot create the same polished product that Singer could. The most important part, the plot, is not outright bad. It presents some interesting questions but doesn't delve any deeper into further discussion.But its presentation, execution, and resolution are unorganized and overly broad. The movie tries to net in many new characters, including four new core X-men; and yet, most of the dialog remains focused on mainstays Wolverine and Storm. The obvious result is a lack of characterization that makes it hard to identify with the newer characters. It's important that the makers shift towards these newer, younger characters; I assume they will play more critical roles in upcoming X-men movies as the traditional actors move on to other projects.The movie also suffers from too many 'earth-shattering' events. In X-men 2, one major character was killed off. In X-men 3, three major characters were killed off and three others had their powers 'nullified.' So in X-men 4 (and there WILL be an X-men 4), the writers will have to think of a way to undo this mess, reviving and re-energizing characters in precisely the manner that robbed comic books of their credibility through 20 years of silly explanations involving aliens, robots, magic, clones, demons and other absurd plot devices. In short, the franchise cannot sustain this rate of radical upheaval.'The Last Stand' DOES have plenty of action. This was actually one of my only complaints with the first two; the action was lacking and seemed a bit mundane at times. I'm glad that Rattner exploits the action potential of the X-men, but several scenes couldn't help coming off as excessive while others were outright corny or low-rent. There were of course disappointments and lost opportunities, but I concede that they can't please everyone.Finally, the movie had noticeably poor editing and pacing. The movie frequently felt choppy, and some scenes seemed out of place or contributed nothing. The characters had some poor lines, and many were completely mischaracterized or had their integrity butchered in order to advance a few silly side-plots.I realize my opinion is swayed by my comic-book background and I grant the movie makers their creative leeway. But we comic book fans are VERY protective of our superheroes. We do NOT want our comic-based movies to be reduced to Hollywood drivel as in the past. Certain creative masterminds have worked very hard to earn respect for superhero movies among mainstream audiences. And maybe that is why comic-book fans are spooked by 'The Last Stand': it is without a doubt one step closer to the inane senselessness of the reviled 'Batman and Robin.' 'The Last Stand' shows hints towards losing the balance and self-restraint against the over-excessive bizarreness in comic books, much like the Phoenix power itself.",5,2,4,29 May 2006
I Am Legend," That's it!?!
","I had heard some fairly positive buzz over 'I am Legend,' so I was looking forward to finally watching the DVD. Some of my friends warned of a disappointing ending, so I did brace for a corny twist ending.The movie begins with a promising, although unoriginal plot: much of the world's population has been wiped out by a horrendous virus and Will Smith's character is one of the only survivors. Smith will have to contend with surviving on his own in a world where many people have mutated into vicious zombie-like monsters. This is nothing new, but I decided to see where the movie makers would run with it.And then . . . nothing happened. Nothing unexpected happened. Nothing unique happened. It was one of the most forgettable, ordinary post-apocalyptic movies I've ever seen. There are violent fight scenes. There are heart-pumping flight scenes. There is a conclusion at the end, but it's hardly a twist.There was hardly anything that was not already done in '28 Days Later,' which was a more interesting movie, made five years before Legend. How did Legend do so well in the box office? Was it simply the Will Smith factor again? Ultimately, I give 'I am Legend' a generous 5 out of 10, mainly because of a stupendous performance by the dog.",5,3,4,8 October 2008
Event Horizon," Horror movie in Sci-fi's clothing
","So my brother-in-law and I are bored: 'Hey, why not go check out that movie Event Horizon?'  'So what is it all about?' 'I am not positive, but it looked to be a sort of science fiction work.' 'Oh, well, you mean like Star Wars?' 'Well, I loved Star Wars!' 'As did I!' 'Well, let us see Event Horizon! Shall  we?' 'Let's! Surely it shall be jolly good fun!'Well, doggonit, that's what the freakin previews made it look like: just another science-fiction movie!  Cool spaceship.  Scientist people.  Maybe some interesting theories about life and stuff.Imagine my shock and horror as the characters began to disembowel each other, rip their eyes from their sockets, and burst sloppily in space (in no particular order).  For an hour and a half, I sat paralyzed in my seat, fingers rigidly clenching the armrests, afraid to blink, afraid to move, afraid to get up and waddle to the bathroom.Mine virgin eyes had never watched Hellraiser nor Friday the 13th nor Nightmare on Elm Street.  I pity the poor theater worker who had to clean up the bricks under my seat after the movie.  THIS IS A FREAKIN SCARY MOVIE.As I may have mentioned earlier, this is an immensely effective horror flick.  Only problem is that I didn't go to the theater on that innocent, summer day so long ago to see a horror flick.  Chalk this one up to poor marketing and misleading commercials.Years later I saw it with a bunch of friends who thought it was stupid and said I was a pansy for being scared.",6,0,2,1 August 2002
Taken," Finding Nemo meets Dirty Harry
","In Taken, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retiree and father who takes helicopter parenting to a whole new level. Mills comes across as an ordinary, likable joe who likes to barbecue in the backyard with his pals, except that he also harbors lethal ninja reflexes from his former job as a federal agent with a murky resume.He's also been a bit abused by the system, having undergone a divorce and having to feebly tolerate the endless whips and scorn of his conniving, superficial ex-wife and constant financial humiliation before the disgustingly rich sockpuppet who replaced him, as husband to his wife and as guardian of his daughter. But they are living the high life now, and Mills is left behind like an obsolete relic, a drag on the party.But then, due largely in part to everyone's failure to listen to his better sense of the world, Mills' daughter is taken. She is snatched away into oblivion by dark spirits thousands of miles away and an ocean apart. So just how far does a father's love go? It all sounds a bit hackneyed, even dated, but nevertheless the movie rides Neeson's performance as the scrappy, determined, and shockingly brutal hunter-tracker who charges through all obstacles, human, physical, societal, or logical, to rescue his daughter. In spite of having been featured prominently in a number of action movies, Neeson looks like a doting daddy, not a tough-guy assassin and I think that is why these types of roles for him result in such appealing, entertaining movies.Taken is a fun, action-packed thriller in which Miller efficiently delivers just dessert to all of the nasty fiends scuttling along the supply line leading to his daughter. It's a bit of a throwback to older revenge and justice fantasies, in which White, middle-class westerners lash out at swarthy ethnic people who are out to exploit and wring dry western civilization. I can see why some would feel that the movie cultivates fear, distrust and xenophobia; I'm actually a bit impressed with how boldly the movie, like Miller, dives headfirst into these thorny situations.",7,0,0,13 July 2013
The Last Samurai," Stir Fry
","**Spoilers ahead but not really if you think about it**Start with one pinch of Gladiator, two parts Dances with Wolves, four parts of Braveheart, and a generous serving of Glory. Release the Tom Cruise in all his rabid, teeth-gritting, brow-furrowing intensity. Mix.The result of all this inbreeding is the most predictable movie of the year.Here is what you might guess The Last Samurai is about, given the trailers and assuming you've seen more than three Hollywood movies in the past 20 years:White man is thrown into far-off, exotic culture. White man clashes with the savage locals. White man is eventually moved by aforementioned, exotic culture. White men wins over the respect of the exotic locals by beating them at their own games and revealing his own areas of superiority. White man joins exotic locals in their struggle, they all fight valiantly against impossible odds, but lose anyway because they are a fading breed of far-off exotics. The only expectation LS failed to deliver was a gratuitous sex scene starring white man and a female member of the exotic natives (though yes, he does get her). So yes, this has all been done before. But for the most part, the cliché plot elements are tastefully handled. There were one or two absolutely cheesy scenes that had me retching in my seat, but all-in-all the movie rarely gets too emotionally ridiculous.Towards the end, I realized Cruise's character could have been removed entirely from the movie and it would have been just as good, maybe better. I give The Last Samurai a 6 / 10: worth watching but nothing special.Oh and don't forget to add ninjas, because Americans LOVE ninjas. Remember those turtles?",6,0,2,7 December 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I guess you can't satisfy everyone...
","Reading various viewer comments, it seems like everyone has different complaints about HP the movie. Some people complain that scene X, which was CRUCIAL, shouldn't have been cut. Others say that that same scene X was not relevant and thus rightfully excluded. Some people say it was too watered down and childish. Others say it was too scary and inappropriate for kids. Sheesh!All in all, I thought it was pretty good. Both my girlfriend, who hadn't read any of the books, and I, who read the first 2, enjoyed it.The only complaint that I would agree with is that the movie was slightly too long. At a hefty 152 minutes, I overheard several viewers afterwards who said that they fell asleep. Although I never fell asleep, I certainly became tired at moments.Fortunately, the mid-movie Quidditch match added a much needed jolt of electricity. Although the CGI occasionally was too apparent, all in all the Quidditch scene was exciting and engaging, achieving what Phantom Menace's ho-hum pod race could not.Acting overall was pretty good. Daniel Radcliffe as HP was adequate, but the real show stealers were Rupert Grint(Ron) as the goofy but loyal sidekick and Emma Watson(Hermione) as the perfectly charming, bookish snob. Even Tom Felton as the despicable Draco did a good job.I give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone a solid IMDb 7. And I'm glad that it dethroned Jurassic Park 2 as the opening weekend record holder.",7,0,0,19 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Some of the magic is gone
","All in all, I enjoyed HP and the CoS less than the first.Just like the first one, Emma Watson's and Rupert Grint's performances stood out over the rest of cast.  Ron Weasely's role seems to be increasingly slapstick.  A lot of scenes depend on his facial expressions.  He's very good at expressions, but this could get annoying in future movies. 
What bothered me the most was the pacing of the movie and the sloppy transitions.  I was downright bored at some points, and this was in spite of the fact that the movie seemed to be rushing along.  Scenes would cut abruptly and the new scene would begin with no intro or build up. Particularly noticeable were the quidditch matches.  Harry et al would be walking down the hall, and suddenly BANG! CUT SCENE ENTER QUIDDITCH MATCH. It would have been so easy to simply slip a line like, ' and during the quidditch game tomorrow...' into the previous scene.The plot in general meanders along somewhat aimlessly and HP and gang spend most of the time investigating false leads.  I know this is how the book proceeded as well, but for some reason it didn't seem to drag and wander so much when I read the book.  Perhaps Rowling is just a better writer than Columbus a director.**** Spoiler ahead but not a major one ****I didn't like the excessively emotional scenes, which seemed forced and contrived.  Of course the ending is going to be cheesey, but come on!  It's been a while since I read the book, but I don't remember every single sentence in the last chapter reading, 'and his/her eyes were filled with tears...'On another note, I noticed that there are already action-figure toys of Hermione in cat-form, a rather shameless milking of a scene that lasted what... 3 seconds??",6,0,0,19 November 2002
Bring It On," a classic?
","I think that over time, this movie may become a classic of a new genre of late 90s-early 2000 teenie-bopper cheese flicks.It has all the right ingredients.  It's basic plot is light and corny. The actors and actresses are all 'pretty' people.  The script is cheesy usually, but occasionally witty and satirical.The thing about Bring it On, is that it does it all SO WELL.  All the characters are exaggerated to fit their stereotypes.  The movie never takes itself too seriously; it does try to inject drama and tension into the plot, but that tension actually has very little to do with cheerleading.Overall, the movie actually draws you in.  Most viewers probably find themselves like that one character (forget his name- brother(cliff??) of the brunette), who kept on rolling his eyes and muttering, 'But it's only cheerleading!' But over time, he found himself clapping along and getting into it, whether he wanted to admit it or not.So if you go to see this movie, LET yourself go.  LET yourself be sucked in. LET yourself enjoy this movie.  LET the cheese engulf you. BE the cheese.",7,0,0,5 January 2001
The Terminal," Flies on sentiment; Grounded by reality
","In the Terminal, Tom Hanks plays Victor, a traveler whose mythical East European country is overthrown while he is in transit to New York City. Upon arrival at the airport, he is told that his visa will not be honored and that he may not return to his homeland because he has lost his citizenship. It's loosely based on a true story, but the plot seems especially implausible in this day and age. You can tell it's going to take a mountain of sentimental handholding to overcome this bureaucratic mess.Every movie is allowed to exploit a few moments of disbelief or coincidence, but the Terminal features an endless chain of unlikely occurrences. If you forget to turn your brain off and you have any experience with air travel, romance, or people in general, then you'll find yourself annoyed by this silly, incredulous movie. Mostly you'll question the irrational behavior of the characters. You'll constantly wonder why characters respond the way they do to events in this movie.The relationship between Hanks and Amelia, a gorgeous airline steward played by Zeta Jones, is highly contrived. Amelia several times mentions how bizarre she is behaving whenever she spontaneously asks Viktor out for lunch having just met him. But merely acknowledging a plot hole does not patch the hole, and the movie plods on inexplicably.*Spoilers ahead* I had to step away from the television for about 15 minutes. As I was leaving, Victor had conversed with Amelia two or three times, and he was helping an airport food worker and an immigration officer become acquainted by relaying messages back and forth though the two hadn't actually met. When I got back, Victor and Amelia were apparently dating in his airport apartment, and the two airport workers were getting engaged (and then married 20 seconds later). That was some 15 minutes!Stanley Tucci's character is reduced to a sputtering megalomaniac of Disney super-villain proportions, evilly obsessed with the destruction of Victor. I could almost see him shaking his fist whiling cursing those meddling kids.Overall, the movie pretends to offer a profound statement about persistence, friendship, loyalty and humanity. Instead it comes off as a silly, shallow, empty romantic comedy.",5,0,4,20 January 2008
X-Men: First Class," Disappointed by disjointed pacing and lack of development
","After being immensely disappointed during my initial viewing, I took it upon myself to give X-men: First Class a second chance, in light of how well others have regarded it. Sadly, my impression did not improve.X-men: First Class, a reboot of the X-men franchise, provides a background story on the team's origin. The movie starts with the early upbringing of Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and his eventual nemesis, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) during World War II, and then jumps forward to the 1960s, when the X-men are formed.The biggest problems in First Class were the disjointed pacing and woeful lack of development of the characters. Scenes unfold rapidly, and then cut abruptly. Relationships are implied without any actual foundation. Xavier catches the recruits partying up like brats after their first evening with each other; he sternly tells them he is disappointed in them. Why? He literally just met them a day or two ago. Shortly afterwards, we are supposed to be riveted by a loss and a betrayal, but again nothing is at stake because these characters have barely been introduced.Yes, there is some character development for the two main protagonists, but it's hindered by an overall weak and superficial script. For example, when we first meet Prof. Xavier as a young man, every other line mentions mutants or genes. Ah-ha! He is an expert in mutation, see? We are constantly reminded by these shallow little references. Throw in a couple 'groovies' to remind us of the time period. It all feels like lines an improv comedian would rattle off if told to impersonate a biogeneticist in the 1960s.The movie also exhibits other hallmarks of sloppy and lazy writing. There is a grating scene in which the new mutants each shows off his or her own power and then provide names. It's the height of telling rather than showing. Later on, in the final showdown, two navies standoff while the X-men attempt to stop the villains' diabolical plan. Like any mediocre action movie, all the officers and crew of the world's two great superpowers stop acting or responding and instead join the audience, standing by idly while the main characters do all the heavy lifting.Prof. Xavier and Magneto, for the most part, are simply portrayed as chums, without much development as to why they are close, particularly in the first half of the movie. It's not until about halfway through that we begin to see real dialogue between them, but even those lines are dull and predictable.Unfortunately, the criticism leveled at January Jones is warranted. She's just not strong enough of an actress to overcome her miscasting. And although I grant the movie makers broad leeway in straying from the comics, I agree with criticism that some of the characters changes are so drastic that there really isn't at any reason to have used that character at all.All in all, I am disappointed by the missed opportunities. The movie could have delved much deeper into the psyche of Xavier and Magneto and the issues surrounding mutation. Instead, we are given cardboard cutouts and the dilemmas are presented in black and white terms. It's not the worst X-men movie, but that's only because The Last Stand was truly atrocious.",5,0,2,9 April 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Explosive dumptruck of justice
","About 30 minutes into Batman v. Superman, I was thinking 'Oh, come on, this isn't that bad. Maybe a 5 or a 6.' Forty minutes later, it was definitely not a six, and near the end of the movie, I weighed whether it was a 3 or a 4. The biggest problem is that the most critical part of the film, the conflict between Batman and Superman, was desperately contrived and clumsily engineered. To be fair, hero v. hero plots in comic books are typically weak, but the final product in BvS is an especially shoddy job. The core plot is convoluted and incoherent (see the Honest Trailers plot cliffnotes on youtube for an accurate description of the ludicrous plot).The pacing is horrendous. Cuts are poorly managed, and there are simply way too many useless scenes. The tie-ins to future movies are too frequent and too long. Also, Snyder needs to work on sustaining a simple linear plot. Get that down, and then maybe he can try more 'advanced' techniques like dreams and flashbacks.The movie is oppressively dark and grim, even unnecessarily gory at times. The script is flat and lifeless; jokes are not readily identifiable as jokes. Batman is a murderous psychopath. But I'm okay with that. Snyder and Affleck can make their own version of Batman. But unfortunately that's not the worst of it: Batman is also a complete idiot in this movie, which is unforgivable. There are a lot of idiots in this movie. Which is usually a sign of a lazy script.The final fight with the ultimate badguy ('DD') feels empty and tedious because there was, once again, no development. The DD comic book was pretty simplistic in its build-up to the final battle, but BvS doesn't even come close to achieving that. Really this entire plot line should have been saved for one or two movies down the road. As for Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, a villain's quirkiness can work on screen, as we saw with Heath Ledger, but only if there is substantive character development that the oddness builds on. There was no development at all of Lex Luthor, so Eisenberg's twitches and mumbles came off as slapped on and gimmicky.Ultimately, I give BvS a 4 out of 10. I think that's a bit generous. But I recently gave Transformers Age of Extinction a 3 out of 10, and I don't think BvS was quite that bad.",4,1,2,26 August 2016
Toy Story 3," Dark, different, but still fun
","As entertaining and fun as it was, I liked Toy Story 3 less than its predecessors. It simply lacked the sweetly poetic and soulful touch that made the first two instant classics.The artwork, animation, music, and voice acting are all superb, as we've come to expect. Toy Story 3 is much darker, even downright creepy at times, a welcome change from the first two. Like Up, Toy Story 3 does not adhere as tightly to a central theme as prior Pixar movies. However, unlike my experience with Up, I did not come away inspired and moved by the adventure and the characters. Instead, the movie felt like it bounced all over, sampling from themes already explored in Toy Story 1 and 2, nibbling on a few new ideas, but never really delving too deeply in any one direction.My bigger issue is that Toy Story 3 relies more heavily on visual slapstick, referential gags, and audience familiarity with the first two movies. In short, it feels much more like a Dreamworks movie. True, Dreamworks movies are fun, but Pixar has always made superior films by sticking to bold and fresh characterization, clever jokes, and sincere, masterfully woven messages.But the end result is still a 7 out of 10. Even when stumbling, Pixar still makes very good movies.",7,1,3,20 December 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Die more harder than ever
","In each Die Hard, the feats become more outrageous as the scope of the movie expands. Die Hard 1 took place in a single building. McClane walked barefoot over broken glass, jumped off exploding rooftops, and single-handedly took down a dozen armed henchmen. Die Hard 2 upped the ante by expanding the setting to an entire airport. Finally, in Die Hard 3, McClane had to race all over New York City to prevent a massive theft of gold.In 'Live Free or Die Hard,' the action takes place all along the East Coast. McClane hops all over the country, from NYC, to DC, to West Virginia, to Maryland. What worked in a single building in DH1 simply looks absurd and childish on a national scale.In Live Free, a covert group of cyber terrorist takes over everything that can be hacked. In a blink of an eye, they take over traffic control, law enforcement communications, the stock markets, private corporate files, federal disaster alert systems, cellphone networks, satellite communications systems, and apparently ANY system that makes use of a camera.The potential breadth and ease of such a cyberattack is already difficult to swallow for a skeptical audience, but the movie turns this leap-of-faith on its head by arbitrarily designating certain computer systems as 'closed circuit.' Yep, notwithstanding the power of these magical hackers (who by the way, can apparently infect your computer with exploding viruses), there are certain systems that can be accessed only by physically storming the facility with thugs toting guns. It's like how Superman's one weakness in the universe is kryptonite, which just happens to be under every rock in Smallville.In DH1, McClane did his best to work with incompetent local police and the FBI. In Live Free, the entire nation is apparently handled by one man, an FBI director played by Cliff Curtis. Forget the President, the NSA, the CIA, the entire military. Those silly feds left the fate of the country of one man, who must always handle matters personally.Disbelief permeates Live Free at the ground level as well. Maggie Q's character is apparently enhanced with steel reinforcements. McClane plows into her with a large SUV and slams her through about five walls. She emerges from the mess as lively as ever, ready to swap kicks with McClane.Lastly, I don't think genius-hacker Justin Long used a single Mac in this movie. Should someone inform Apple of this harsh betrayal?",5,1,2,10 November 2008
Contact," movie that's sure to polarize
","The reason I rate this movie so high is because ultimately, I think it phrases the atheism vs. religion debate very well.**spoilers**I've read many reviews that criticize the plot from a religious view, saying that it makes Christians look bad and only advocates atheistic perspectives. However, the main point of the movie is that those who supposedly do not believe in God, those whose perspectives are grounded in solid facts, those who know the world strictly from a scientific or objective view, underestimate the power and role of believing and having faith without knowing.Ultimately, 'facts' and 'scientific' knowledge are just as subjective as beliefs and religion. I have yet to see another movie that communicates these ideas as well as Contact.",9,0,2,21 June 2001
