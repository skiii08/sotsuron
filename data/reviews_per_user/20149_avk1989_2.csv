The Hangover," Absolute comedy!!
",this movie was absolutely amazing. It's really difficult to sit in the seat during the course of the movie. The movie is a non-stop comedy and I fell of the seat 3 times during the course of the movie and absolutely lost all of my energy laughing through the movie. For all those who want to see an absolute comedy movie this movie is for you!! :D :Dthe role played by Bradley Cooper was really good. The scene where he humps the tiger was really funny!!Zach Galifianakis was really hilarious during the movie. He was totally out of the world :D,10,25,44,23 July 2009
Hancock," A over-hyped movie
","Basically,I'm a Will Smith Fan. I have seen really good works of his. This movie was among the few bad ones. People may have given good ratings to this movie. The point of the story is actually pretty sad. The acting were good though. Going first to the positives. The screen play was amazing. The acting was good.Now to the negatives. Somethings in the movie made absolutely no sense at all. Tue story was well thought off but was poorly implemented. The ending of the movie was pretty stupid. Its like out of nowhere they say that they are linked. And Charlieze Theoren goes into the dead and returns. And she gets to live whenever Smith i.e. Hancock hurts himself. Overall I would rate his movie a five and recommend this title mainly for people below 16 or so.",5,1,2,12 July 2008
