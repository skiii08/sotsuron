Lucky Number Slevin," One Of the greatest twist action movies i've seen
","This movie is given less credit then it deserves. not to talk about the rewards i think it should receive, it is so well edited, the cast is really really great, i think this is the first time i saw Josh Hartnnent in a great performance. Bruce Willis is the psycho sociopath hit-man, and the twist at the end is not expected, at list not for me. i really tried to avoid seeing this movie, because i read the plot and it seemed stupid as hell, but the movie came out wonderful. so if you're interested, you want something to keep you stuck into the screen for about 2 hours, watch it. seriously, one of the best action movies i've seen in a very very long time.",10,7,10,6 January 2009
Zodiac," Well Fincher Has his way with murderers
","The movie was really good, really good. i think the thing i liked the most was the camera work, really brilliant. Zodiac is a killer in the 60's - 70's in SF, CA. the movie shows Zodiac in a really creepy way, Jake is awesome, plays the one with the obsession to capture the Zodiac, he's doing his job better then i could imagine. Robert Downey Jr. is really cool, with his all 'i rule' approach. Mark Ruffalo is with side wigs :D but he's great as a detective too. i've researched a lot about the Zodiac, so i had great expectations for the movie. i must say, i have absolutely no complain, Fincher has his way with Thrillers. really, if you're up for a good movie which will make your spine beat himself, after you've seen it, go see Zodiac.",10,1,4,20 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," I don't understand the comments, really...
","this movie was just stupid and a waste of time. no sense and no message at all reached to me, i didn't understand whats spacial about the movie, it was badly made, and boring.i saw it with some friends, only one stayed awake trough it all, we all fell asleep, first time in a movie this happens to me.so OK, a couple of good action scenes, Tommy Lee Jones is doing his job, the actor who plays the killer really doesn't do anything spacial, i don't thing he deserved the Oscar. anyway, too many useless and pointless dialogs you can throw away, the movie made a bad impression on me which i don't expect from the Cohen brothers. save yourself the trouble, due to the 'genius' mind of the Cohen brothers by some of the critics, this movie blows.peace",1,1,6,23 August 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Pretty awesome..
","A few things about lord of the rings:the return of the king; except the fact i hate Frodo (well that's just me personally), because he's such a fanny, the movie isn't bad at all. its actually a very good way to end the triolegy. but the ending, really? there were like 8 different endings to that movie, showed us what happened with every da*n characters from Legolas to Frodo. we don't care! 40 minutes of ending, that sucked, and pretty much destroyed the expectations. also, too many dialogs, i understand that there's plenty of plot, but still, they could have cut some of them and leave them for the really-big-fans-ill-watch-LOTR-for-7hours. i suggest, watch it, cut the movie 35 minutes before the ending.Rols Rois, out :]",10,0,1,17 August 2008
