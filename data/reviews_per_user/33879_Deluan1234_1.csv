The Lobster," A very bold and honest display of what the dating scene is turning into;
","The Lobster begins with Colin's character being divorced by his wife. He then has 45 days to find a mate or he is turned into a animal of his choosing, a lobster. Lots of heartlessness throughout the movie and their ordeal in finding mates. top-notch acting and splendid cinematography. This movie captures what women could become which is downright terrifying. Revealing the frailty of the man and his inability to be perfect. However even perfect people suffers in this re-imagining of America dating culture. The twist is you must have some thing in common between two mates. If you are far-sighted your mate would be. If you have a limp then your wife should have a limp. Because having a mate is the equivalent of having car insurance or a drivers license.",10,2,7,6 June 2016
