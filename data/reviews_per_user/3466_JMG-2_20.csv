The Devil's Advocate," Never bet the Devil your head.
",This was a surprising movie. I knew I was going to like it but not as much as I actually did. Al Pacino was amazing as John Milton and Keanu was mediocre as Kevin Lomax. The movie is saved by Pacino's performance and a very good script. It really was a great movie by all standards. I loved the endiing also it really was good and had a neat twist.,Null,0,1,12 November 1999
Gremlins," One of my favorite Christmas movies.
","This movie is awesome it is just too funny everything from Gremlins attacking Citizens to Gremlins Breakdancing is outrageous. These critters are really a HUGE pimple in the rear. I really like this movie and everyone seems like they had fun doing it the movie is very underrated for dumb reasons like parents thinking it's too dark for their children. Well I saw this and MANY (Including the Freddy and Michael Myers films) movies as a kid and I turned out fine it is all about how you explain the film to them and then they will understand besides it isn't even as bad in tone as the previous films I mentioned. Anyway Phoebe Cates was one of my first crushes mainly because of this film and is pretty good in it I also like Mr. Anderson who was hilarious in the scenes were he fights off the Gremlins. And I will never ever Forget the Gremlins getting drunk in a Bar or singing along to 'Hi, Ho' at a late night screening of Disney's 'Snow White & The Seven Dwarves' it is simply just too funny.",Null,0,1,25 July 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!
","This movie is truly a masterpiece everything about it from the acting to the action to the very memorable score shines. I cannot think of one negative thing to say about this movie it is just amazing. I love the Indiana Jones character and Marion was always my favorite of the 'Indy girls'(Karen Allen was sorely missed in the follow up to this one).Lucas and Spielberg truly created an 80's icon and one of my heroes with the Indiana Jones character. The movie was definitely the best of the great 'Indy' trilogy. I Highly reccomend this one to any Action/Adventure fan it is a true gem. I you haven't seen it yet don't rent it, buy it trust me you won't regret it.",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
Wayne's World," I'm mental over this movie.
","'Wayne's World' is just one awesome movie, especially when you see it with your friends. This has to be one of Mike Myers best movies ever it is absolutely hilarious and filled with great scenes like when they are listening to Queen's 'Bohemian Rhaspody' in the 'Mirth Mobile' or even the Scooby-Doo Ending my most favorite scene though is the one with Brian Doyle Murray(Bill's brother)as the Arcade mogul on the re-newed 'Wayne's World' you'll know what I mean when you see the movie. Everything about this movie shines and the comic timing is just perfect.",Null,0,1,29 October 1999
X-Men," Disappointing.
","I don't know what it was but something about this movie just disappointed me. I've been reading the comics since 1991 and have watched every single episode of the old Fox cartoon and I have also read most of the TPB's from the 80's. So it can be said that I was realy anticipating this movie. Sadly it left me disappointed, Cyclops who is my favorite character wasn't really fleshed out as much as he should've been and in my opinion had no chemistry with Jean which is a big no no. Jean and Storm were a joke compared tot heir comic book counterparts. Magneto, Rogue and Wolverine were my only favorite characters in this movie and i'm not really a huge Wolvie fan. They were the best written characters and also the most close to their comic counterparts. I did not like what was done with Mystique, Sabretooth and Toad at all. I've never really liked Toad but Sabretooth is a character with SO MUCH potential and one of my favorites in the books here he is reduced to a dumb witted lackey which totally goes against everything the character stands for just like Bane in Batman & Robin he was severly butchered. The direction was alright and I've always been a supporter of Patrick Stewart as Professor X since the early 90's although he really shows his age in this movie and i've always pictured the Professor as someone in his late 40's not someone in their 60's. This is one movie in which the Sequel NEEDS to be a serious improvement over. I hope they finally nail it with the sequel. Unlike 'Superman II' and 'Batman' which are two of the greatest Comic movies i've ever seen this movie has problems fleshing out it's villains and even it's main characters so there is no one to really root for. Like 'Batman' however the Action scenes are very poorly filmed and sometimes even hard to follow. I don't know but I was seriously hyped for this one maybe that is why I felt so let down. All faults aside I'm still buying the Special Edition DVD when it is released.",Null,0,0,27 August 2001
The Thing," Very Cool.
",'The Thing' is one of those movies that are just too cool for their own good. I was hesitant to see it at first since I figured it would be some 'Alien' wanna-be I was glad to be proven wrong. Kurt Russell is great in this movie which is his second collaboration with John Carpenter. Keith David was ok with the scenes he did have he usually rocks but was ok in this film. However the movie itself is a horror and sci-fi classic that shouldn't be missed for anything. The plot was very interesting and guessing who was and alien and who wasn't was a lot of fun I highly reccomend this movie especially too see it with a couple of friends.,Null,0,1,17 September 1999
The Shining," A masterpiece.
","'The Shining' is a movie that shouldn't be missed the movie is not 100% faithful to King's novel but it is fantastic nonetheless. This is one of Nicholson's best movies as well as Kubrick's(who im not such a big fan of). The movie is great visually,story wise and the performances are top notch. This is truly one for the library and it is one of the greatest horror intended movies i've ever seen.",Null,2,2,17 September 1999
Dark City," Gotta love this movie.
","It is fantastic. Definitely one of the strangest and most original movies i've ever seen. I loved the Film-Noir aspect of it and the ending was really cool when we find out the truth about the City. The movie was absolutely gorgeusly shot. And it had a great cast Kiefer Sutherland was very good in it. It also was at the hands of a great and talented up and coming director, Alex Proyas. If you want to see something new and cool this movie is highly reccomended.",Null,0,1,12 November 1999
Ghostbusters," A classic among classics.
","This is my second favorite movie in the world why well simple it has a brilliant cast Bill Murray,Harold Ramis,Dan Aykroyd,Sigourney Weaver,Ernie Hudson,Annie Potts and especially Rick Moranis fit their roles perfectly. This movie holds a special place in my heart it has brilliant quotes my favorites being 'He slimed me' and 'We came,we saw, we kicked it's ass' and Bill Murray one of my most favorite comedians it also has a great story and extremely likable characters. There is no way that I could see anybody hating this movie at all. The soundtrack is also just fantastic. See this movie just for the scene of their first bust in the hotel that scene is just priceless. This movie is a true comedic classic.",Null,0,0,29 October 1999
Back to the Future Part III," A GREAT CONCLUSION TO A FANTASTIC TRILOGY!!!
","'Back to the Future part III' is one of those movies that you hate to see end fearing you will never see those characters again. I felt so bad at the end knowing this was going to be the last i've seen of Marty McFly and good ol' Doc Brown I tell ya it was like seeing two of my closest friends leave. Thank god for their brief reunion on 'Spin City' last season this the western of the three and the most enjoyable western i've ever seen.
I loved the way the 3 movies focused on love and Doc and Marty's friendship the first focusing on Marty's parent's relationship the second on Marty's own relationship with Jennifer Parker and the third on Doc and Clara's relationship. The movie works in all merits Romance,comedy,Drama it's all there I especially loved the scene with Doc and Clara disscussing Jules Verne which showed us a side of Emmett Brown we never saw before and the scene with the train speeding up the DeLorean. Not to mention Tom Wilson's memorable villain Biff's great grandfather Bufford'Mad Dog'Tannen.The only problem I had with the movie like another IMDB member pointed out was that Doc and Marty just shook hands at the end knowing that they will probably never see each other again they should've at least hugged. Other than that the movie like it's predeccessors is highly reccomended.",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
Dumb and Dumber," 'Pretty Bird'
","I really thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. Lloyd and Harry's antics are hilarious. I really consider this one to be Jim Carrey's best not the Farrely Bros.'s best thought that title goes to 'Kingpin'. The movie is filled with great and memorable scenes. My faves are the Blind Kid and the Parakeet on 'A Current Affair',Harry and Mary's snowball fight,Harry using the John and Lloyd's daydream. I could go on and on. This movie is awesome. Highly Reccomended like everything else I review",Null,0,0,12 November 1999
The Evil Dead," My favorite of the other 'Dead' trilogy.
",While others consider 'Evil Dead II' to be the best one I think this one was the best the movie managed to scare me in some places in broad daylight. Bruce Campbell isn't as loose as he is in 'Evil Dead II' and 'Army of Darkness' but he is Bruce so he's still cool. The movie was very low-budget and still managed to have some impressive stop-motion effects. This is also the grossest one of the trilogy. I highly reccomend this one to any horror fan out there or anybody who will like to see Ash's sister get raped by a tree.,Null,0,0,17 September 1999
Die Hard," A great thrill ride.
","'Die Hard' is probably the best action movie I have ever seen. Bruce Willis was born to play John McLane and Alan Rickman is fantatsicly cool as Hans Gruber. The movie is a movie that should be seen with strong surround sound for you to be able to experience it fully. It is definitely not one to be missed and one of the greatest movies of the 80's. Highly reccomended.'Yippe-kai-ei,motherf*cker'",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
Army of Darkness," Ash is Back.
",'Army of Darkness' is a fantastic movie that really delivers. I have seen this movie about 20 times and I know it by heart. I liked this one more than 'Evil Dead II' mainly because it wasn't set in a cabin again instead they did something original and gave Ash a whole new environment which was a very smart move by Sam Raimi. The movie is absolutely hilarious and is filled with lots of 'Evil Dead II'-esque one liner's. I really reccomend this one very highly I have seen both endings to it and I can't wait for the criterion collection DVD I just hope that they make an 'Evil Dead IV' that will be sweeeeet.,Null,1,1,17 September 1999
Back to the Future Part II," GREAT SEQUEL TO A FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!
",This movie is just as good as the first which is the greatest film ever. I really liked the time lines in the movie my fave scenes were in the year 2015 the alternate Hill Valley was cool also. Everyone puts this one down as the 'weakest of the trilogy' and I have no idea why it is one of the funnest movies ever. All in all this movie is highly reccomended of course to see it you have to see the first one or you'll be lost.,Null,0,1,17 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," One word summary:WOW.
",I've seen this movie 3 times already and I still can't believe the awesome ending which nobody saw coming. My hat goes off to M.Night Shymilyan for making a fantastic and well thought out movie. If Hayley Joel Osment doesn't get nominated for an Oscar there is no justice in this world. The movie is truly one of Willis' best and also has a pretty good performance by Bruce. Overall if you haven't seen it what are you reading this for go and see it...NOW.,Null,0,0,17 September 1999
Heat," Superb
",This movie is just amazing. You get two of the greatest actors in the world and pair them up with the director of the brilliant movie 'Manhunter' and you got yourself a winner. I love this movie alot it really is very humane. It is so good that you don't know which character to root for the Cop or the Robber. The ending gets very suspensful and this movie has to have one of the best action scenes of all time in the form of a bank robbery. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone it is really good.,Null,0,0,12 November 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Far superior to 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'.
","This movie is the true sequel to 'Raiders' and it was very cool and better than 'Temple of Doom'. The movie begins with an unforgetable chase through a circus train with a Young Indy(The late River Phoenix) which even explains that scar on Indy's chin. In this movie Indy is after the Holy Grail and it turns out that the Nazi's are after the Grail also. This time Indy is joined by his father Henry Jones(Wonderfully played by Sean Connery),their good friend Marcus and Sallah. The movie is full of great stunts and action sequences especially the boat chase scene. This movie rocks and if you are looking for a good way to spend two hours watching this movie is highly reccomended.",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
Back to the Future," THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!
","Back To The Future is hands down my favorite movie of all time.I like the sequels just as much but I have seen it about 80 times and every time I see it,it feels like a whole new experience.Awesome Soundtrack,Great Cast and the Best writing and directing I have seen for a sci-fi comedy makes this one a true classic.",Null,0,1,3 July 1999
Evil Dead II," A good sequel.
","Although it's more comedy than horror 'Evil Dead II' is still a pretty good and entertaining sequel to 'The Evil Dead'. Despite people who call it a re-make of the first the movie is a direct sequel to 'The Evil Dead' the only reason the first five minutes were re-done was because of copyright laws that Sam Raimi didn't own. I personally enjoyed 'Army of Darkness' more however this movie is filled with great one-liner's and a great but brief scene with the hero fighting hiw own hand and it has a great ending too. I highly reccomend it to anybody who loves horror or comedies and if you don't at least get one chuckle from seeing this movie then I advise you to calmly remove the stick from your @ss.'Dead by Dawn,Dead by Dawn'",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
