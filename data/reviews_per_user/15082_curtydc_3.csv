Sucker Punch," Not for the mindless majority
","I don't have a lot of fancy words to shovel down your throat, but I'm still going to throw my opinion into the ring.I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. From start to finish I found it engaging, telling, and entertaining. The music was great and set the pace for much of the film. It's not quite on the same scale as Daft Punks' Tron Legacy score, but the opening sequence with it's accompanying track are perfect. The effects in this movie are impressive and not overdone, I never felt like this movie was trying too hard. The otherworldly scenes came and went without being too short, or too long, but felt just right and delivered what I came to expect from the incredible trailers leading up to this film. I loved each character, they all stood out as individuals, but stood together as a great cast, oh and they looked really good. The story outside the action sequences is where the mindless are going to be left behind, if you came to this film with only the expectations of pure sexy action, then you will be unprepared, and you will get sucker punched. This film delivers so much more than that, it's got bone, flesh, and blood. In other words, it's got a plot that isn't paper thin, and a fleshed out storyline, something not many action flicks bring to the table these days.I felt this movie paced itself just right, it had action, it had story, it had intelligent characters. I'm a fan of Snyder's work, I loved 300, found Watchmen to be watchable, and I loved Legend of the Guardians. Sucker Punch is a great addition to Snyder's portfolio. I can't wait for this films BD release, because I'm sure Snyder will deliver even more with special/extended content.",8,3,10,29 March 2011
Paranormal Activity," Over-hyped but not worthless
","A group of my friends went to see this movie when it was released in theaters, they all came out of it glorifying the movie. Don't by into the hype.I waited for the DVD, mainly because I can't stand seeing horror films in theaters, reason being I can't stand the obnoxious people who crack jokes and laugh at the scary parts so they don't pee their pants. I'm glad I waited for the DVD, because I would have been disappointed had I of seen it at the cinema.There is enough praise out there for this movie already, so if that's what you are looking for you'll not get it from me.So lets begin. The acting wasn't terrible, but the characters themselves were unbelievably fake. The actors do a decent job, but what they had to work with wasn't decent at all. I felt the characters were very dumb. On multiple occasions the characters are walking through their house at night looking for whatever made the bump sound. They appear freaked out, and yet, they never bother to turn on a light, instead they search aimlessly in the dark. Now why am I complaining about such a little thing? Because no one in their right mind would go walking around their house at night thinking something scary was in there without ever turning on a light. Also, they sleep with the bedroom door wide open. I know closing it wouldn't really stop anything from opening it, but at least it would give you a little extra sense of security. I'm just saying, in real life, if this were happening to you, wouldn't you close the bedroom door? Or turn on the lights if you thought something was in the house? The characters are just not believable. Next and last complaint. The movie is extremely repetitive and very predictable. Basically, the movie goes like this, it's day time, characters are talking about the same thing they always talk about and are getting less and less sleep but it's not really affecting their lives, now it's night time, they are sleeping, the camera fast forwards to somewhere around 2-4 pm time-frame, something spooky happens, the characters go looking for the cause, find nothing, go back to bed, it's day time again, and repeat. You know when the scary parts are going to happen, it's never a surprise when it does happens. The scary parts hardly even come off as scary, because they are situations that would only be spooky if it were actually happening to you.So, with that, if you like scary movies, you might like this, it's not a completely worthless movie, but it's really not that good of a movie. 5 out of 10 is fair I'd say.",5,0,1,31 December 2009
The Fountain," Like a Picaso
","This movie is like a painting, a masterpiece to some, and a scribble to others. I loved it, everything about it. It's not a simple movie, the plot is not layed out for you in a traditional manner, it is a movie that you have to think with, you cannot just watch it and casually enjoy. If you have an acceptance for stories that do not fall within the norm, give this movie a chance. If you are not tolerant of new idea's and uniqueness, don't bother, you probably won't like it. I encourage you to watch the movie, and I encourage you to find a reason to like it afterward. I watched the movie with a friend in a theater with only three other occupants, two of which walked out not even halfway into the movie. Three out of five remained, not bad I'd say. I enjoyed the movie, and the next day I found myself pondering over the story trying to sort it out further. This was a masterpiece in my opinion, a true work of art.",9,1,2,13 December 2006
