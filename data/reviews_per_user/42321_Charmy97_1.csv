Gremlins," awesome
","there have been many movie of comedy and horror combined. such as ghoustbusters or the gingerbread man. But only one film takes the ability to scare and do insane stuff ant the same time. Thats why i am completely bonkers for gremlins. The gremlins may be monsters, but they are monsters of the most important ingredient for movie that we hardly see...CHAOS! That is what a monster movie needs. Not some crappy story about a guy who goes into your dreams, or was dead and some how came back. I have a word for that....overused OvErUsEd OVERUSED!!!! And gremlins really take the cake when it comes to chaos. The story is very ORIGINAL the characters are lovable as they are hateable. I don't care much for all sudden deaths but gremlins are BARBARIC! the real lucky death for everyone is Mrs.deagles death. The gremlins shoot her through a window.....no they didn't shoot her THEY LAUNCHED HER!!!!!Also the thing that entourage's me is the theme song. It has a circusy scary and crazy feeling that no movie composer can do anymore because of audience demands. Also the fact they got voice acting legend FRANK WELLKER to do some gremlins and stripe. Frank does many voices but none is creepier than stripe.overall(s) in short: i haven't seen a movie like this and hopefully i will in the future.....",10,0,2,1 September 2009
