The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Twilight Sega Breaking Dawn Part 1
","It was what all of the Twilight fans have been waiting for. For Edward and Bella to get married and it turned out alright but Jacob was mad at Edward because when they have a baby its going to hurt Bella. And it was amazing than any other Twilight movie I have seen so far. And then Edward and Bella has the baby but it's not just 1 its two babies. And its a great Romance movie if people like the Twilight Sega and Romance movies this movie is for you. I say buy it, its worth the money. But rent it first to see if you like it or not. Thank you this has been my review on this movie. Mostly this is a romance movie this movie has more romance in this movie than any. Its rated PG-13 it has parts in here that is not for little kids to see but its a heart warming movie and great special effects and I love movies like that. This movie is better than Harry Potter and Lord of the rings put together.",8,0,6,12 February 2012
