The Avengers," Sequel coming you say???......umm, YES PLEASE!
","Lets face it...I'm writing this 'review' 6/15/12 and if you haven't seen the movie by now, then odds are you aren't planning on doing so! Just saying. That being said, I'm not one to post spoilers, so a general review will be given. Actually, I probably could sum it up in one statement:THE HULK FRICKING OWNED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!Yes; Thor, Ironman, Captain America (helllooooo sexy!), Hawkeye, and Black Widow all had their shining moments (which is another layer of awesomeness to the film), but anyone who watched it would more than likely agree that although the big green guy was not in many scenes, he still managed to OWN this movie! The energy of the movie is absolutely amazing and I personally cant wait until the sequel!",10,7,15,15 June 2012
