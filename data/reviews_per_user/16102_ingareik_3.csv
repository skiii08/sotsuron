Hereditary," Horror for horror fans
","This movie horrifies me
I am not talking about cheap horror - jumpscares, which only give you quick adrenaline rush for two seconds. No, I am talking about proper fear.This movie makes you feel every fear-related feeling;
terror, shock, nausea and sadness. It gives you a feeling of uneasiness which will last hours after you've watched the movie.Oh, and it is one of the best rewatches ever. So many hidden details.",10,2,5,22 January 2020
The Babadook," Metaphor heavy
","This is a movie where the ratings have a high mean but a large variance. If you go in expecting a jumpscare-fiesta you will be dissapointed.The Babadook doesen't really rely on jumpscares and scary monsters the same way other horror movies do, dont go in expecting a quick adrenaline rush. But if you rather let yourself invest in the story you will get an
'OOOHH'-moment when you realize the metaphor of the film, which adds a sense of realism to the film. Nothing is scarier than realism in a horror movie.",9,1,2,22 January 2020
The Witch," True psychological horror
","I went in expecting an atypical horror movie, and I got exactly what I expected. I advise you to watch this movie alone in a dark room, on the biggest screen in your house with the best soundsystem.The Witch is a textbook example of psychological horror done right. It doesen't rely on cheap jumpscares like modern horror movies, but manages to chill you to the bone with how everything is presented. Pair the amazing performances by the actors with the great sound design, and add a dash of gruesome imagery and you get The Witch.",9,1,2,22 January 2020
