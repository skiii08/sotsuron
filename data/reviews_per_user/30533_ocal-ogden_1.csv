The Expendables 2," worth a watch
","Here we have a group of action guys doing what they do best, make action movies.I am glad now we have this action packed movie expendables2. Expendables 2 is a good movie full of action and jokes and a few surprising cameo appearances. The movie features some great actors with a few side remarks regarding the stream of action movies they have all produced together. The first scene is great full shooting and smashing all the stuff that makes a film watchable.The movie does not overdo its stay and finishes at the right moment. Expendables 2 does not really fizzle from the first scene it keeps the pace going and is well worth watching. I for one have now seen the movie twice and rarely do i do that.",7,2,3,9 October 2012
