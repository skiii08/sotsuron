50 First Dates," NIFTY, FIRST RATE!!!!!!
","My mother rented this film and I didn't want to see it cos I thought it would be just slushy and girly and really predictable. HOW WRONG I WAS!!!! This is an absolutely FANTASTIC movie!!! Nice to see Adam Sandler back on form after Punch Drunk Love (what was THAT about!!?) even though it's not his best and felt kinda muted to me - a bit more gross out humour would have done it, but if you have a mental character in a film I suppose there's only so far you can go. Drew Barrymore is REALLY SWEET!!! I mean REALLY SWEET!!!!!! Which is just such a surprise as I've never seen her do that before. And I really didn't see that ending coming. It had me in tears!!! I like a film to be unpredictable and this one was in spades. My mother said it reminded her of Groundhog Day but I said who cares, that's an old b&w film and who remembers that anyway? She agreed with me after a while. So GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Fifty times!!!",Null,7,18,17 November 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Worth staying alive for!!!!!!!
","To be brutally frank neither I nor my mother have yet seen this film BUT WE SO WANT TO!!!!! After all, Ocean's 11 was absolutely brilliant, one of the best films i've ever seen and i've seen quite a lot. And it cheered mother up no end, as she wasn't very well at the time. She isn't very well now, as a matter of fact, and is confined to her bedroom (actually, she's confined to her bed, but that's another story) but her eyes lit up and I could tell she was keen when the teasers for this started appearing. We won't be able to get to the cinema (well, she won't, anyway) but let's hope it turns up on DVD pretty soon, or VHS. It's a shame sometimes that films like this can't go straight to video to help out the housebound and bedridden. Still, there's that nice Mr Chan in the local market who often has these things on DVD even before they're released in the cinema over here and he might be able to help me out. Anyway, how can you not want to see this film? It's OCEAN'S 11 (and this is the clever bit) PLUS 1!!!!! How cool is that? And it's got George and Brad and Julia and Matt!!! They're all so great, I really feel like they're my friends. I'd love to invite them round. The only fly in the ointment (that actually happened to us recently, btw, as the weather has been a bit up and down) is that Vincent Cassell is in it. He's French and tends to do a lot of arty stuff which I'm not too keen on. Mother saw 'Read My Lips' but didn't like it as it was in French and she wasn't going to be bothered to read the subtitles. Anyway Cassell looked awful and my mother said that he should be ashamed of himself, turning up to work looking like that. Anyway, I hope they don't give him much screen time as I don't see why I should have to read subtitles when the film is full of Americans so I hope they've got him to speak English or dubbed him or something. Anyway, enough of my yakking, as you Yanks like to say. Go see it. It can't be bad!!!!",10,3,7,17 December 2004
The Polar Express," Is Tom Hanks ill?
","Mother and I have now seen the preview for this movie, and I just have to ask, IS EVERYONE BLIND?!!! TOM HANKS LOOKS AWFUL!!! Dead staring eyes? Skin like a tailor's dummy? Jerky uncoordinated movements? Are these signs of good health where he comes from? They certainly aren't down our way. Gone is the physical and energetic chameleon who won our hearts with Bonfire of the Vanities, where he played Sherman McCoy opposite that blonde woman whose breasts GREW BIGGER as the story progressed (it can happen btw). Now, though, he's but a shadow of his former self. Is this one of those big public secrets - like Michael Jackson or George Bush - that everyone knows about but no one mentions? HE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY, VERY ILL!!! We sensed something was wrong when we heard his attempts at speech in 'The Ladykillers' and thought things had gone from bad to worse when 'The Airport Lounge' came out. Mother said he was on the way out then('obvious irreparable brain damage' were her exact words) but he seemed fine afterwards in interviews - dribbled a bit, but he's at that age - so we thought he was on the mend. Thinking back, though, everyone was always very, very nice to him, as you are with someone who's been ill or is a bit simple, so I suppose that was a bit of a giveaway. So. America. LISTEN UP!!! I realize that he has a lot of friends in Hollywood, but I think the kindest thing to do surely, rather than to cast him in lead parts in multimillion dollar movies, would be to send him home and call the doctor. Surely none of us want to risk losing this brilliant leading actor when all that is needed is a kind word, some bed rest and possibly some sort of enema? I'm tired of watching this great man suffer just so some studio exec can set fire to yet another five dollar bill and shove it down some stripper's g-string. Have some compassion, PLEASE!!!",Null,0,2,18 November 2004
