The Sound of Music," Slow moving non-musical
","I always thought that an operetta or a musical film should contain fairly fast moving action,choruses,humor, perhaps some uniforms,catchy music and singing talent. 'The Sound of Music' contains only some of these.There are uniforms but not necessarily ones you'd want to run into.They're not Austrian Hussars,Russian officers,Mounties, but Nazis at the time of the Anschluss. Nor are they the most exciting voices: the Mother Superior exhorts,somewhat out of place, the 'Climbing of every Mountain', the Baron (or Count),if he does at all, sings in an uninteresting bland voice; Julie Andrews is no Lily Pons or Kathryn Grayson, or even Jeanette MacDonald,but vocalizing in 'Pediatric'.walks us through her favorite places where 'the dog bites' or 'the bee stings'. 'When you're sixteen' etc. is rather insipid, and the nuns' chorus is on the juvenile side. The Baroness acts insecure rather than malicious and the whole cast of characters is not more than unidimensional. The photography and scenery are excellent,but apart from this I would feel that this is a children's picture; perhaps that was what was intended.",6,3,13,19 February 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," What more can be said?
","Nearly everything has been written about this masterpiece by the specialist of the broad canvas,David Lean.As with 'Dr.Zhivago' he paints just as well a wide expanse either of snow or sand.He is wonderful at depicting minute figures almost overwhelmed by the great backdrops seeming to engulf them. Lawrence,the risk taker par excellence,either biking too fast for safety,or undertaking the impossible trek to Akaba never bores us. Lean portrays the great expanses of time or distance,twelve days to Akaba...or the conflicts of risk ..'You must be at the well before sunrise', which in other directors' hands could be tedious. Peter O'Toole acts the tortured character of Lawrence at war with his dark side,confessing to 'enjoying' executing a tribesman. Jack Hawkins as Allenby acts the ambivalent British officer,promising, tongue in cheek, support which he is unsure that he can supply. Anthony Quayle is delightful as the imperturbable,understating British officer. The beginning sums Lawrence up well with the interviews given to the press at his funeral. This film is extremely helpful if one wishes to explore the Middle East mentality and thre unfulfilled promises of Arab independence following World War 1.",Null,0,1,6 February 2003
Ben-Hur," Ben Hur,an image of the Christ?
","During this expansive (in time and space) story,in view of the title aka 'A tale of he Christ'one might ask oneself whether Judah Ben Hur's is a token of Christ's life on earth. Thus: he rejects the benefits offered by Messala for compliance with Rome; a type of the Last Temptation on the Mount:'all this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me'. He endures humiliation,flogging and other punishments unjustly. He acts as an human savior in rescuing other galley slaves as well as a harsh overseer. He is given drink by the Christ while on a killing trek from prison to the galleys. At risk to himself he pursues and embraces his long lost(during his 3 years as a galley slave)family now wracked with leprosy resulting from incarceration. Twice again he refuses acknowledgement of Rome to his stepfather and to Pontius Pilate. There is a contest with Messala, who  realistically represents Satan,and overcomes him,witnesses the Via Dolorosa and the Crucifixion,the following storm and earthquake,when his two sisters are miraculously healed.        In this film we see Imperial Rome as civilized barbarians in all its brutal splendor.The background for the chariot race are quite out of place for Jerusalem,as is much of the scenery,where with the crowd and Pilate it would be appropriate for the Circus Maximus in Rome.         All the same this is without doubt an extremely thought-provoking and inspiring film,and it deserved all the honors and Oscars bestowed upon it.",Null,2,5,30 March 2003
