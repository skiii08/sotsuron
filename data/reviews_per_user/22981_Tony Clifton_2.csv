Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Great beginning to a six year affair . . .
","One of the things that people say hurt this movie is the lack of a rogue-ish character ala Han Solo. True, but if there were a Han like character in the movie, people would have bitched about lucas not being creative anymore and critics would have reemed him for rehashing the same formula over again. Many people complain about the acting, saying no one acted well. But if you examine the originals, you'll see similar acting. Star Wars isn't about acting, it's about being a kid. It's about getting that warm fuzzy feeling in your stomach when the Fox Fanfare/Lucasfilm logos shine on the screen. It's about having fun. None of the movies are meant to be thinking movies. Want to think? Read a book!  Want to enjoy a choice piece of film filled with action, scenery, effects and story? Watch this or any other Lucasfilm movie (minus Howard the Duck)!",9,18,27,5 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A movie that continues to change lives!
","I hate it when people try to say that star wars is not a good movie. Some people try to say that it is not intelligent and doesn't make you think. I say, if you want to think, read a friggin' book! If you want entertainment, go to the movies!Many people try to say that 2001: Space Odyssey is the better movie in the sci-fi genre. I don't know about you, but the only thing enteraining in the movie is when the apes beat up the fire ape. I can't remember the rest of the movie. I fell asleep through the rest of it.Star wars is criticized for being too kiddy. That is the best part about it. It makes you feel like you were young, with no responsibilities or cares in the world. It lets you escape to a place that you hold special in you're heart.This holds the same for other greats like Willy Wonka, Indiana Jones, and any other movie where John Williams composes the music.SO the next time any of you star wars bashers out there try to say that star wars isn't the greatest of all time, remember when you were a kid and what a movie ment to you back then.",10,0,0,12 December 1999
