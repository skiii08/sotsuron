Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic film with a little cheese on the side
","One of the great films of the 20th century, yeah it gets a bit cheesy at times, but that's the point. This entire collection of Indiana Jones flicks is so entertaining and never seems to get old. My favorite scene is near the end when Indy threatens to blow up the Ark with a rocket launcher, and during Belloq's speech a fly actually lands on his cheek, crawls onto his lip and either goes into his mouth or is sucked in deliberately by the actor. It just shows great focus on the craft and probably a need to get the scene finished under the hot Tunisian sun.I cannot wait for IJ4 and am curious to know what the plot will be as well as who Indy's new flame is...",9,0,0,23 July 2004
