Skyfall," You fools are easily impressed.
","Mixing things up and changing the formula of a popular franchise, doesn't equal a good movie. Casino Royale was a blast, Quantum was a let down. I expected a return to form, I don't know what happened.The opening scene was terrific, I was drawn in immediately. I loved the Bond sequence along with Adele's bond theme too. However, the opening scene ends with Bond unconscious underwater after being shot and falling 50-100 feet. The next time we see Bond he's alive and how he survived is never explained. Okay...That aside, the film was still flowing well, until we were introduced to the beautiful Sévérine, whose character was completely irrelevant. She's set up as the Bond girl. Bond tells her he'll save her and everything, and she just dies very suddenly. I guess it was for shock factor, and because it's different. That doesn't make it good, however.Anyway, I'd be able to look by these things if the rest of the film was good. But it wasn't. Lazy decisions and pretentious shots of Bond trying to come across 'deep'. The whole plot was basically about some nut trying to kill M. Really? That's your best idea? It's as if the writers were thinking 'what's never been done before? Ahh, we'll make it personal. We'll have a nice emotional scene by killing off a big character (M) and we'll visit Bond's roots. Then people will love it!' It goes from a Bond film to bloody Home Alone! Setting booby traps in Bond's home. It was ridiculous. Anyway, it's as if the writers thought their work was done after coming up with that rubbish. They should have focused more on a better plot, as well as the characters. We need a memorable villain. Has any of the villains in the new Bond movies been memorable? I think Jaws is a little more memorable than Silva. Everything about this film was just completely forgettable. Don't get me wrong, we didn't have much of a villain in Casino Royale either, but that was still a solid film. Brilliant actually. Then it all went downhill after Casino Royale. I don't know what happened. This film had potential, but was let down by a lazy, and simply dreadful script.'This is the best Bond yet!' - Shut. Up.",3,6,15,19 November 2012
Nightcrawler," Awesome, creepy, immoral, inspiring?
","Probably the best performance I've seen from Gyllenhaal, absolutely magnificent. Something about his eyes in this movie, and his character as a whole, just very creepy.Lou Bloom is a pretty dark character. He does some twisted things to get the footage he needs. He starts to make his way up the ladder, and as he begins casually joking with the news anchors and the like, it makes you uneasy. He's just completely numb, all he lives for is his twisted profession. To watch him engage in camaraderie, it's almost a performance from Lou Bloom himself. As if he is just constantly manipulating. He knows what he wants, and he'll do what he needs to get it.As creepy as he is, it's difficult not to admire the character's ambition and success. Admire isn't the right word, what he does is wrong, but the ambition is still respectable in a sense. Sort of like a much darker version of Jordan Belfort. It's essentially The Wolf of Wall Street, but with less money and more blood. Sort of reminiscent of Taxi Driver too.It's difficult to put into words. Just a brilliant, twisted tale. Check it out.",10,8,14,28 January 2015
Spectre," Worst in the series
","I know that sounds dramatic, but it's true. Almost 3 hours. Of nothing.Just talking, talking, talking. Not nearly enough action, no character development, lazy writing, and just a bad script overall.For a film of that length, it's hard to believe there's such little depth and purpose of the main villain. I was looking forward to Waltz' performance, but they did such a disservice to the character and did nothing with it. Making him... yes, Blofield, was pointless. It served for nothing. The writers (all 7 of them) were clearly completely void of any ideas or creativity.They had to link all the films together and make Oberhauser (Blofield) responsible for everything, he basically admits to being solely responsible for all the sh!t that has happened to Bond since Royale, that was their lazy cheap philosophy of the character, and f-ck it, he's also Blofield. So Bond wants to kill him. That is the plot. Is it that bad? Yeah.Once Bond is after Blofield in the final battle I was at least expecting the film to go out on a high, but it's a weak chase that ends nowhere. The entire film and every action sequence was just Anti-climatic. That is the film in a nutshell. No punch, no fun. Nothing. It just drags. Nothing memorable at all. If Oberhauser wasn't Blofield, there would be nothing to talk about. And for a Bond film of nearly 3 hours, that isn't right.Even the opening scene, had been done before and better in Goldeneye. The scene where Bond jumps off a cliff and basically divebombs into the plane, and maintains flight seconds before crashing. Silly, right? At least it was fun, and memorable. Similar scene in Spectre with a chopper, but smaller in scale. Poor for what should be the big opening. The action overall was just uninspired. Bit of a dull car chase with Bautista which ends with Bond escaping using the ejector seat, looking chuffed with himself in the process. He just destroyed the technically astounding Aston Martin he had for 5 minutes, and for what? The ejector seat should really be a lost resort. It's like he got bored of the car chase (I did) and thought f-ck it, I'm bailing.It looks good. The film is well shot, but there's no fun to be had. Nothing profound. Just a bad script that made for a bad film. It's that simple.I thought Skyfall was victim of a poor writing and style over substance much like Spectre, but it was more ambitious and had some nice action here and there. This though, was 3 hours of nothingness.I didn't come here to hate. I had to vent frustration, as a fan of the series. There's some good lines in here, and some nice camera-work and locations. But that is it. Nothing else going for it.Poor effort.",3,26,59,30 October 2015
