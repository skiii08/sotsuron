Gremlins," satirical fun
","The original Gremlins movie is a delicious satire upon all those small-town Christmas fables that one associated with Frank Capra and Steven Spielberg (even though he never made one...except this, he's executive producer!)  In post-ET 1984, a cute little critter comes into town with a set of rules that frankly don't make sense (isn't it always midnight somewhere?)  Then he gives birth to Satan's own hordes and the fun and mayhem begin.  From the bubbling swimming pool to the bulldozer to the speech about when Santa got stuck up the chimney, this is one big heap of laughs.",8,0,1,26 January 2004
Antz," Miles better than A Bug's Life
","Miles better than A Bug's Life.  The latter film was just bugs-in-peril...a bit like The Seven Samurai, yes, but essentially unimaginative (if funny). This takes Woody Allen ('the middle child in a family of 6 billion'), makes him best mates with Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Lopez, and sticks him on the run with Sharon Stone.  At the same time, thousands of his fellows are massacred in a Starship Troopers-like attack by termites.  Only in animation.  It's exciting, it's clever, it's often hilarious, and it boasts one of the best ensemble casts ever put together.",9,10,15,21 January 2004
Ghost," I neeeeeeeeed your loooooooove
","I well remember the moment I realised that Ghost was a good film.  It was several years since 1990, and I had written it off as a pointless chick flick.  Then two female friends decided to watch it and, having nothing better to do, I cynically sat down to watch it with them.  When I started to borrow tissues, I knew I'd been wrong.  It may star two of the biggest has-beens in Hollywood today, but you can't deny the emotional power of this love story from beyond the grave, somehow keeping its punch even when competing against a comedy sub-plot about a `sassy' psychic.  And remember the ugly guy on the train, too.  A cheesy classic, but a classic nonetheless.",9,11,14,17 February 2004
Spartacus," Epic done well
","I am not a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick.  I am not a huge fan of sword-and-sandal epics.  Spartacus is great.  Kirk Douglas is the sort of hero that the likes of Russell Crowe could never hope to be.  The love scenes may be dull, but the action isn't, and Kubrick loves to put in his little bits of light and shade - the famous 'oysters' scene.  And as for that memorable climactic scene...did I mention that I'm Spartacus?  And so's my wife.",9,0,1,20 January 2004
Erin Brockovich," More than a one-woman show
","Notable for being the film that changed my opinion of Julia Roberts. Finally casting aside the shadow of too much mid-90s s***, she deserved that Oscar.  And, for my money, this was a far better film than the over-directed Traffic.  Oh, and Albert Finney is brilliant in this too.  People say it's a glorified movie-of-the-week.  Does the genre matter?  It's been glorified so well, it's become a brilliant movie.",9,1,2,21 January 2004
The Big Lebowski," See what condition your condition is in
","The wacky and indeed zany riposte the Coens chuffed out to Fargo's breakthrough hit status, this ended up rivalling it in critics' affections. Giving Jeff Bridges his signature role, this mixes bowling, kidnapping (of course), German porn, nihilism, modern art and Julianne Moore's vagina (of course) to make a surreal pot pourri of complete incomprehension.  The film starts with a tumblin' tumbleweed...well, why not?  A Stranger turns up to dispense advice from under a stetson...okay.  One character has a completely unexpected fatal heart attack...fine.  The Dude goes into a dream sequence that makes you feel you've dropped acid...whatever.  You can't argue with The Big Lebowski, because it's coming from a place you can't even imagine. Sheer class in an utterly odd way.",9,1,2,16 February 2004
Shakespeare in Love," Oscar got it right after all
","Some day, someone will be able to review this movie without mentioning Saving Private Ryan.  Not today.  In 1998, I couldn't believe that this Gwyneth Paltrow romcom won the top honours.  Today, this film has grown on me while Spielberg's has not.  It's clever, funny, dramatic and romantic, so it hits all the right buttons.  And a terrific ensemble cast love every minute of it.  Alright, so Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth I is overrated, but the production shines from virtually every pore.",9,2,4,3 February 2004
12 Monkeys," Monkeyyy!
","One of the best time-travel movies of the past couple of decades, this takes in a dystopian future, a present on the brink of collapse, a lunatic asylum and the trenches of the First World War, and all in pursuit of something called The Army Of The Twelve Monkeys.  This is probably the first time people noticed that Bruce Willis could really act, although his flashier co-star got all the plaudits.  But it's the director's show all the way.",9,0,0,21 January 2004
The Fifth Element," A lot better than I remembered
","I'm ill at home today, so decided to re-watch The Fifth Element. It's the first time I've seen it since 1997, when I saw it in the cinema.
I didn't like it much then - probably graded it about a 4.8 in IMDB terms. I'm glad to report I was wrong. My criticism back then still stands though. After an hour of slightly silly SF epic, Chris Tucker turns up and screams at me for the rest of the film. Fortunately, it annoys me less now. Maybe I'm just used to him, having enjoyed Rush Hour? But his first scenes are still the movie's low-point. Along the way, though, there's just so much fun to be had. Besson's vision of the future, essentially a dayglo Bladerunner, is beautiful to say the least, despite being built on a bedrock of pollution and fog. And the actors all heartily overact (Ian Holm, Lee Evans, Gary Oldman) but that's part of the movie's charm. Only Willis plays it straight, recycling his joe everyman with a gun character once again, and impressing more than I remembered.
The design of this movie is far more praised than its script, and I think that's fair. Still, the multiple plotlines are fun to try and keep hold of, as about 6 different parties try to get on board the ship to Phloston, and the President keeps track of his agent by listening to the Rudy Rodd show. As for design, well, Besson and Gaultier do themselves proud, although the latter's costumes are occasionally distracting - note Lee Evans' sailor's uniform and Gary Oldman's odd headpiece. In the end, the Fifth Element doesn't really make sense (so is this all in aid of life on Earth then? Had the element not heard of war 5,000 years ago? what the Hell is Luke Perry doing here?) but it doesn't have to. It's nice-looking fun. Oh, but the last scene, which comes across like Moonraker crossed with some Jewish-mother comedy, is awful. I'd give it about an 8/10.",8,0,1,27 January 2004
Finding Nemo," Painfully good
","The formula works, dammit!  This is a story about a fish who goes in search of another fish, and is helped by a third fish.  There are some sharks, some turtles and a fish tank full of, yep, fish.  Oh, and it contains probably the scariest movie moment I witnessed in 2003  Marlin and Dory becoming surrounded by jellyfish and needing to get out without being stung.",9,1,3,5 February 2004
Ed Wood," Upbeat biopic
","What's not to like?  The ensemble cast are all terrific, and the handsome black and white cinematography perfectly sets off what is, really, an optimistic film.  Look how it ends - with the critical lambasting of Plan 9 From Outer Space?  No... with its premiere.  An odd, sometimes rambling, little film. But classic stuff about a less than classic artist.  The scene where he meets Orson Welles is great.",9,0,0,20 January 2004
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Yee-ha
","Why is the 'Raindrops' bicycle sequence in this movie? That aside, this is a great old movie, that, as a non-Western fan, I was relieved to find seldom felt like one. It's two guys on the run, on the wrong side of the law. *beep*, this is where all 80s buddy movies were born. And the two leads are icons solely because of this film.",8,1,3,19 January 2004
Predator," Stealthy and deadly
","Who's taking bets on who's going to win when Paul Anderson sets them against the Aliens then?  They're very different species  where the Aliens tend to attack in force, the Predator in this film is a tracker, a hunter.  He's got chameleonic/invisibility technology long before the Jem'Hadar in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  And he steals an entire film from Arnold Schwarzenegger. The sequel is also good, by the way, but doesn't quite come up to the class of the original.  Set entirely in a jungle environment as the cast get picked off one by one, it's as if an alien monster has been dropped into the middle of Platoon.",9,0,0,28 January 2004
The Thing," Whatever happened to...
","I very rarely buy a film without having seen it first, but my confidence paid off here. Taut, thrilling and full of memorably gory effects, this takes the classic pick-'em-off-one-by-one formula to its heights. Ah, John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, how we miss you.",8,0,1,14 January 2004
Apocalypse Now," Epic
","Strictly speaking, I am voting for Redux here.  My relationship with this film is strange.  I first saw it, recorded off the telly, in the mid-nineties.  I couldn't get on with it at all, and ended up watching it over about 4 sittings.  Predictably, I didn't think much of it, gave it a low score, and didn't return.  But when Redux was released in the cinema, I thought I should give it another try.  And this time I was far more impressed.  I don't actually know which scenes were added (stealing the surfboard?  the Playmates?) but I don't really care.  It's an epic journey through Hell.  I haven't seen the famous documentary, but what's up there on screen is enough for me.  Brando can sod off, though.  I still don't like the ending.  But the way Robert Duvall delivers `Some day this war's gonna end...' is just beautiful.",9,0,1,28 January 2004
Face_Off," I love Face/Off!
","Really?  Do I really like this that much?  It's a completely silly action movie, after all, with a premise so ludicrous you really ought to laugh through the film.  But I was well into all Nicolas Cage's 90s action output, and he and Travolta have such fun here playing, essentially, each other. Actually, it's a bit of a shame, because Cage has such a good time as Castor Troy in the opening few minutes that you kind of wish he didn't have to relinquish the part.  But Woo marshals the action pretty nicely, and the film gets really creepy about half way through too.  See this for big explosions and silly plot twists.",9,0,0,28 January 2004
Dark City," Messianic
","The film that came before the Matrix. From the man who gave us The Crow, Dark City contains many of the later SF epic's themes - mysterious men in black patrolling what seems to be an ordinary world until one man wakes up to find everything's been manipulated. It falls short of The Matrix if only because it lacks flo-mo fight sequences...but it kicks the arse of Reloaded and Revolutions.",8,0,2,14 January 2004
Good Will Hunting," Surprisingly good
","This is a very good film.  Apart from the 'apples' line, that is.  Robin Williams gives one of those occasional performances that make you weep for all the wasted time spent on the likes of Flubber, while the other leads match him.  For my money, it's the emotional journey of the older men that provides the best value, although Minnie Driver shines in what is easily her best ever role (well, maybe Tarzan).",8,1,4,15 January 2004
Event Horizon," Bodes well for Aliens v Predator
","One of those films which deserves its placing through its initial effect on me.  Seldom have I been more shat up by a film.  Most of the big scares are false ones  hands on someone's shoulder etc  but it still had me on the edge of my seat, as the cliche has it.  It looks wonderful  check out not just the Event Horizon itself but also the zoom out from Sam Neill at the beginning, which just keeps going and going...  Maybe it does rip off Hellraiser, and maybe there are bits that don't make sense, but it does have a bloke on fire, Sean Pertwee (always a plus), a member of one of Britain's noblest acting dynasties being almost drowned in blood, and a truly horrible scene where one character goes out of an airlock.  This proves that the generally accepted `Paul WS Anderson is a talentless hack' line is pure baloney.",9,0,2,16 February 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Shame
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** So now we know why the fourth film from Quentin Tarantino had to become the fourth and fifth films from Quentin Tarantino.  He said that a 3 hour grindhouse kung fu movie would be pretentious.  Well, yes, but only because what you've started with is pretentious to begin with!  In this first hour and a half, so little happens it's unbelievable.  I can't believe that he couldn't have got it down to a decent running time.I'd have been willing to take Uma Thurman's escape from the hospital as read, but Quentin has to show us her wiggling her big toe for minutes on end.  We spend ages watching people get places - Uma's journey to track down O-Ren Ishii, for example, which takes AGES.  There's a scene with a Texan sheriff which does nothing.  We get a lengthy part-animated introduction to O-Ren Ishii, a character who we already know is going to be dead soon anyway.  The use of animation is inspired, I admit, but I just don't care about the story it shows.  What else?  Well, the whole Sonny Chiba sequence is superfluous.  Again, I'd have been quite happy for her just to get a sword from somewhere.  I don't need this man to argue about coffee. Although I did enjoy some of the dialogue (`I'm not bald, I just shaved my head.')So, OK, he's written too much.  But, annoyingly, he's directed too much as well.  Quentin has always stood on a knife-edge when it comes to over-directing, but here he tumbles over it.  Every time the Bride sees someone she wants to kill, the Star Trek klaxon starts blaring, which is irritating.  Also, her name gets blurred every time someone says it, which is just silly.  David Carradine's hands give a great performance, which is slightly tiresome.  He tells the story out of order (as always) and you can sort of see why.  But just occasionally, it hinders rather than helps. Were we supposed to see O-Ren Ishii's name already crossed out on that list? And the Pussy Wagon gets a laugh, sure, but would have got a better one is we first saw it when Uma first sees it.  And as for the fight...Oh, let's get to the big fight sequence now.  Hyped beyond belief, this is Uma Thurman battling 88 people, or something.  Could have been great. Isn't.  I still like it better than Matrix Reloaded's so-called burly brawl, because there's no annoying CGI here.  But after a while, I realised I'd zoned out.  It just wasn't doing it for me.  Partly because he decided to switch to black-and-white, which is just pointless.  And partly because...Well, there's two issues here.  One is that I have never seen a so-called grindhouse kung fu movie.  I have no idea what tradition he is reprising. I only know who Sonny Chiba is through True Romance.  So this movie is not, can not be, targeted at me.The other issue is about violence.  There's just too much of it.  And I don't often say that.  But it loses any effect after a while.  It becomes boring.  And it occasionally becomes distasteful.  When Gogo (?) gets whammed in the head with a plank of wood with a nail through it, her death is lovingly filmed.  He's savouring it.  Whether it's different because these are women isn't an argument I'm going to get into right now, frankly. But when it comes to violence, QT has always been master of implication (the ear-severing) and of the short, sharp shock (Marvin's death).  He almost entirely abandons these in Kill Bill for grand guignol lopping off of limbs.It doesn't work.  His geysers of blood and chopped-off arms only remind me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, while Lucy Liu's death...oh dear.  I found Ray Liotta's scenes at the end of Hannibal to be hilariously bad, and our sighting of O-Ren Ishii's brain at the end of this film pretty much tops even that.Back to distastefulness.  The pregnant Bride is beaten up, shot and put into a coma for 4 years, waking to find her baby gone.  I think that's enough. But no, she has to have been raped continuously for 4 years too.  This is another superfluous sequence.  I could have stood it if it hadn't been treated almost as an amusing aside.  One rapist is killed by having his tongue bitten off in a comical way.  The other has his head banged in a door.  These people, especially Buck, are as sick and evil as the Viper Squad, if not more so, yet she hardly seems bothered about it.So what keeps it from instant 1/10 status? Well, it's a Quentin Tarantino movie.  And he's still got it.  Not all the time, far from it.  But there are a fair few moments that remind me of glory days.  Actually, what with the excellent use of split-screen and cameras passing over the set walls, they remind me most of Brian De Palma circa Snake Eyes, but that's not a criticism.  The film starts promisingly with my favourite scene, Uma Thurman versus Vivica A Fox.  The gun in the cereal is a classic Tarantino moment. There are memorable motifs like the Pussy Wagon, and Uma's Bruce Lee-aping tracksuit.  Lucy Liu isn't far off from being a revelation, and it's nice to see Daryl Hannah resurrected in a role not a million miles away from her Bladerunner days.So have I given up on Quentin Tarantino?  No.  Not quite.  I'll wait till his next film (sorry - his one but next film, I doubt I'll bother will Volume 2).  Because I think this is just something he's been needing to get out of his system.  He's always wanted to make this movie, and now he has. Well done.  If he doesn't now move on and make some movies I want to see, rather than movies Quentin Tarantino (or Clarence Worley) wants to see, then he and I will say bye-bye.",4,6,9,23 October 2003
Big Fish," Magical
","In many ways, this doesn't even feel like a Tim Burton film.  Largely shorn of the dark tones and sinister shadows of Edward Scissorhands, Batman or Sleepy Hollow, it's more like Burton via Cameron Crowe, a comparison further held up by the presence of Billy Crudup.  With Ewan McGregor present, however, together with themes of love-against-the-odds and magical realism, the comparison is more with Moulin Rouge!  Add all of this together and you've got an enchanting tale.  But it's not flawless - for starters, it's really quite slow.  (*There follows some plot details, no spoilers*) While, in the present day, we follow Crudup's attempts to get closer to his dying father (Albert Finney), the film simultaneously shows us McGregor as a young Finney, in flashbacks that are almost certainly apocryphal.  He becomes a 'big fish' in his home town, then strikes off on his own, coming to a village called Spectre.  It's at this point that the movie becomes a little plodding, but it picks up a bit once he spies the love of his life...  In essence, it's a slightly uneven film with wonderful moments - the popcorn, the daffodils, Danny DeVito.  And it's a rollercoaster ride through Tim Burton's imagination with giants, witches, mythological beasts, circuses, romance, sky-writing and fish.  The cast is outstanding, although the most memorable turns come from supporting players such as Steve Buscemi, in great form.  One stand-out aspect is the way it actually gets *better* towards the end.  Films never do that, and certainly not fantasy-tinged films like this! So it gains an extra point for a truly wonderful ending.",8,0,0,26 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Stylish and not wacky
","I've been looking forward to the release of this film for some time. Although the cinema trailers prepared me for the basic concepts, I have to say the structure of the movie took me slightly by surprise.  The idea of your lead characters spending most of the movie in one of their heads is intriguing, and it's hard to think of anyone other than Charlie Kaufman who could have pulled it off.So let's start from the beginning.  We witness what appears to be Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine's (Kate Winslet) first meeting, which all goes very well.  Then, as we're settling into the movie, the opening titles finally play and we're into their break-up.  The concept of Lacuna Inc is introduced  it transpires that their science-fiction tinged services have allowed Clementine to completely erase Joel from her memories.  Pained by this, Joel agrees to undergo the procedure too.  This occurs at his flat that night. As he sleeps, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood plug him into their machine and begin to delete.  The only trouble is, trapped in his own unconscious, Joel has changed his mind, and is desperately trying to keep hold of Clementine in whatever way he can.Although the attention-grabbing bit of this movie takes place in Jim Carrey's head, there are nice moments beyond it too.  The Lacuna team are well-represented, and the sheer moral discomfort we get from seeing Dunst and Ruffalo frolic in their undies around Carrey's corpse-like form heightens Kaufman's dark vision.  Dunst, in particular, is very good, and it's always nice to see Tom Wilkinson in a film.  More curious is Elijah Wood, completing the foursome.  It's good to report that, after all this time, it didn't seem odd to see Frodo as a human, but one has to wonder why he took the part as he has very little to do.  Nonetheless, the moments he does have are very nice, and more or less set him up as the unexpected villain of the piece.So to the stars.  Everyone's been enthusing about Kate Winslet's performance.  She is good, and I don't think I've seen this character from her before, but then I always knew she was a good actress.  Jim Carrey, however, makes the film his own.  You know how every role he does is more or less a riff on the Carrey/Ventura persona?  How, even in Truman Show, his `good afternoon, good evening and good night' schtick is still there?  Well, it's not here.  There is nothing of Carrey the wacky comedian in here.  This is surely the performance of his career, and probably my favourite performance of the year so far.I really liked Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I can't help but feel that the central concept isn't fully explored  does no-one think that people might want to erase memories not connected with bad love affairs? This doesn't matter, so long as you take it as another in the chain of high-concept magic realism love stories that have been sprinkling smiled into our multiplexes over the past few years.  Michael Gondry's direction, though showy, is slightly less flashy than Spike Jonze's in Being John Malkovich, and all the better for it.  On this evidence, Kaufman is likely to remain the most important writer in America for the foreseeable future.8/10",8,0,1,11 May 2004
Titanic," Near, far, wherever you are...
","OK, the biggest film of all time.  Let us remember that it was good.  It looks astounding, even now.  It takes the already good A Night To Remember and improves upon it.  The much-derided love story works for me, I'm sorry. In fact, the one bad thing anyone had to say about this in 1997 was that the dialogue wasn't up to scratch.  Excuse me?  How many quotable lines? `She's made of iron, sir.  I assure you, she can sink.' `I'm the king of the world!' `We are dressed in our best and prepared to go down as gentlemen. But we would like a brandy.' `You unimaginable bastard!'  This film is a true classic in the old-fashioned sense of the word.",9,2,4,17 February 2004
When Harry Met Sally...," Charming
","For many, this is the ultimate romcom, although I have others I prefer.  But it does come from a director I respect and stars a man whose comic potential has so rarely been scratched beyond his Oscar hosting duties.  Although I liked Forget Paris.  The orgasm scene is overrated, but it's the interplay between the two leads that is so good here  it's the best elongated relationship movie since Annie Hall, and some scenes can only be the result of the actors goofing around (`pecan pie...')  And then there's the date scene where the wrong partners get together.  Mm, yes, don't know what else to say.  I liked it.",9,1,2,5 February 2004
Con Air," We need Bruckheimer
","If you don't love big, stupid movies with huge explosions in them and (usually) a lightning bolt hitting a tree at the beginning, then move on now.  If you do, then you probably like Con Air.  A hero who's motivation is so tunnel-vision he can kill and utter dialogue like `Put the bunny back in the box' without batting an eyelid.  A villain called Cyrus the Virus.  A plot so idiotic as to be genius.  And a marvellous supporting cast wandering around proceedings desperately trying to get some screen time.  Best of all is Steve Buscemi as a psychotic serial killer who claims `One girl, I drove through three states wearing her head as a hat.'  Big?  Yes.  Clever?  No. Subtle?  No. Award-worthy?  No.  Fun?  Yes.  Take popcorn.",9,0,0,16 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The second half is a great movie
","The film opens with a big space battle - fair enough. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor are on a mission to rescue Ian McDiarmid from Christopher Lee in what we presume is a put-up job, although it's never made clear. Lee is killed off pretty swiftly in a scene that is very effective if you've seen Return Of The Jedi, but not to worry - he's in cahoots with the leader of the Seperatists, a half-droid creature called General Greivous. Yes, that is his name.Two problems with the film present themselves here. One is that, as always the politics are interminable. The other is Greivous. He's an entirely CGI-character, not as bad as Jar Jar by any means, but the problem is that he just doesn't work. The character fails to be either impressive or interesting and as he takes up much of the first half of the movie, we suffer. Still, Lucas has now reduced Jar Jar to two appearances and one line in the whole movie, so it's not all bad news. Ahmed Best's name in the end credits is clearly a cruel joke.Mcgergor's Obi Wan Kenobi, searching for something to do, goes after Greivous and finds himself in a battle sequence that feels like it's in a Pixar movie. Meanwhile, Christensen's Anakin becomes closer and closer to Palpatine and more and more estranged from Sam Jackson and the rest of the Jedi Council. Oh, and his wife is pregnant. Portman gets almost nothing to do this time around.The film really picks up at about the half-way stage. McDiarmid reveals his true nature and is allowed a light-sabre duel with half the Jedi Council. He uses the Force-lightning from 'Jedi', which backfires and causes his face to look, well, like the Emperor. Jackson buys it only when Anakin finally chooses a side and chops his hand off, leaving Palpatine to finish the job. This film's obsessed with limbs being chopped off! Turned to the dark side, Anakin is dubbed 'Darth Vader'. No explanation is given. He is then sent off to kill the Jedi in the 'Temple'. When it gets there, it turns out they're children. He does indeed kill them all - off-screen. But the scene is spoilt by a kid who makes Phantom Menace's Jake Lloyd seem like Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver - after this moppet speaks, you WANT Vader to wipe them out! Meanwhile, the clone warriors turn on the Jedi in a very effective montage sequence that sees all the Jedi wiped out. Sole survivors, of course, are McGregor and Yoda. Yoda has been hanging out on the planet of the Wookkies for NO REASON WHATSOEVER! We get to see Chewbacca give the green fella a piggy-back, but his inclusion in the film is never more than tokenistic.So things begin to spiral towards the inevitable conclusion. Palpatine dispatches Anakin to a volcano planet named Mustafar (er, James Earl Jones's character in The Lion King) followed by Padme, unable to believe what he has done, with Obi Wan as a stowaway. Oh, C3PO goes too. I can now safely say that 3PO too has NO ROLE in ANY of the prequels and is only here to satisfy fans. R2 at least gets some action (if a little silly).Palpatine gets into a fight with Yoda. Ooh, boy. Some real good stuff here - the two of them fight in the Republic's council chamber, a very satisfying payoff to having put up with talky scenes on that set for three films now. It does give rise, however, to some unbelievable dialogue. Yoda speaks like a parody of Yoda - he actually says 'Not if anything to do with it I have!' I expected him to follow it up with 'Feel lucky punk do you? Mmm? Ahead you go - my day make!' On Mustafar, Anakin gets angry at Padme's rejection and strangles her a la Darth Vader in film 1. Obi Wan stops him and them duel. Yes, it is a very good duel, but somehow it doesn't have the sense of occasion that other duels have had. This is fine, though, because at the end we get to see Anakin burning up horribly - this scene probably the sole reason behind the PG-13 cert.So Palpatine rescues Anakin and puts him into the Vader suit. We get to see Vader walk and hear him talk - briefly. I'd have liked a bit more, personally. Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia and promptly dies. The film ends with a million loose ends hurriedly tied up. A pretty bad lapse sees Yoda inform Obi Wan that Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson's character in Phantom Menace) has returned to tell him how to survive death - but we never see Jinn nor is this built upon. It's the thinnest possible excuse for why Alec Guinness becomes a ghost in the original film. Anyway, ROTS ends with, well Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru staring into the Tatooine suns-set with a baby in their arms.There's a lot of criticism here. But I'm a Star Wars fan, and this is still a 7/10 film. There are loads of good moments, mainly involving deaths, light-sabres or both. Christensen is absolutely fine, McDarmid is fantastic and the otehrs pass muster. McGregor finally gets to show real emotion when yelling at the dying Anakin. And it does feel like the motion picture event it should be. It could have been better and the first half is a waste of time. But I'm glad I saw it.",7,1,2,24 May 2005
Carrie," King is possible
","The trivia about this film are often trotted out, but more important is its effectiveness as a piece of sheer terror. Forget the rest of the film - it's the moment after Carrie's final humiliation, when the doors slam shut. It's the look of complete distraction in her face as she does it. It's De Palma's virtuoso use of split-screen throughout what follows. I never thought the famous ending matched up to this.",8,0,0,14 January 2004
Raging Bull," Classic
","'You f*ck my wife?  You f*ck my wife?'  One of the holy greats from Scorsese/De Niro, this is Rocky fed through reality.  A great boxer becomes a great bum - that's the pitch.  Never mind the stories about De Niro's weight gain - look at the performance, look at the people around him, look at the direction.  A genuine classic of cinema.",9,0,0,26 January 2004
The Sixth Sense," Scary, but more
","Like The Usual Suspects, this is a movie whose standing is based largely on its initial effect.  It wanes with repeated viewings.  It still remains an astonishing breakthrough feature for an almost unknown director, and showcases one of the best child acting turns ever.  I know his movies make you want to bite rope now, but go back and look - he's good in Sixth Sense. And it's about so much more than the twist.  Cut off the twist, and you might not know you were missing anything - up to then, his relationship with his wife has been a sub-plot.  Having said all of this, this is not my favourite M Night Shyamalan film.",9,0,0,27 January 2004
The Truman Show," In case I don't see you...
","So now Peter Weir has a BAFTA.  For some boat movie.  Well, whoopee-do. Never mind his earlier, better movies.  Such as this.  A story about the ultimate betrayal on one hand, a deconstruction of the hyper-realist nature of our post-modern lives on the other, and an unintentional retelling of Doctor Who  Vengeance On Varos on the side, this is really something of a minor masterpiece.  Carrey's Truman Burbank is a put-upon hero to rank with George Bailey from It's A Wonderful Life, a man whose destiny is to come face to face with `God' (and it's also better than Bruce Almighty).  One of the more perfect endings put to celluloid caps it.",9,0,0,17 February 2004
Cube," Better than Sphere
","One set.  About six lighting options.  A handful of cast members.  No budget.  Sounds like the perfect formula for a classic indie horror movie to me.  This often gets pigeonholed as Sci-Fi...is it?  A bunch of strangers are dumped in a huge cube in the middle of nowhere filled with deadly traps. In the end, how many - if any - will get out alive?  And which among them will be the first to crack?  Oh, there's a mildly offensive portrayal of a sub-Rain Man autistic.  If that sort of thing p***es you off, give it a miss.",9,0,1,21 January 2004
Jackie Brown," Low-key
","As a lower-key third film, this was always going to split critics. There's more genuine emotion in this film than in either of Tarantino's first two, but the dialogue is both as sharp and as gimmicky, and the directorial tics are in place (check out the shopping mall cash drop sequences). Also features some of his best ever characters, notably Bridget Fonda's Melanie and Robert De Niro's Louis.",8,2,5,14 January 2004
The Wedding Singer," SO much better than The Wedding Planner
","This one should raise a few eyebrows.  The one film I've seen that justifies Adam Sandler's existence (Ok, I raised the occasional chuckle at Happy Gilmore), the joy of this film is the way it revels in the 1980s.  As I have a huge soft spot for the films of that era, I play right into this film's hands.  Pleasingly, the 80s theme doesn't rest on references to Rubik cubes, Dallas etc - it is also mirrored in the film's structure, which is every inch a cheesy eighties romantic comedy, down to the air-bound finale.  Oh, and Billy Joel shows up at the end for a genius cameo.  Yes, there's a rapping granny in it.  But sometimes bad gimmicks happen to good movies.",9,1,2,21 January 2004
Beetlejuice," Don't you just love it
","He's a character from the ghost world - if you repeat his name, he will come, and then you'll have the problem of getting rid of him.  He is not Candyman.  He is Michael Keaton, in perhaps the most bizarre performance of his life.  Can you believe someone put this actor and this director in charge of their Batman franchise?  It's an insane riot from the moment Keaton is introduced, and the smorgasboard stretches from ghosts dressed up as ghosts to Keaton's head on a snake to the famous 'Day-O' sequence.",9,1,2,27 January 2004
