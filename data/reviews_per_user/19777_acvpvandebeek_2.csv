Casablanca," Old but Gold
","Ah Rick Blaine the lone wolf who runs a respected saloon and he doesn't worry about anyone or anything. The way he's played is great and you can clearly see that he's respected by everyone that visits his saloon. I personally think that's his dialogue is one of the best there is, it's a bit comical yet very just. He's the kind of guy that you'd follow orders from regardless what they were, he has that kind of influence on the others in the movie.But our Rick also has a soft spot and this is for Ilsa Lund, his former lover, and when they meet again he'll do everything to help her and her husband Victor Laszlo from escaping Casablanca and going to Lisbon, like so many others would like to.Seeing an old black and white movie really made me want to watch more of this genre and I'll surely will. This movie is a classic and even now I find this to be one of the better movies that there is, old but gold really applies to this one.",9,0,2,29 May 2016
Lincoln," Really good but tedious
","Right at the beginning of the movie, they show us the harsh and cruel side of war with people stabbing and trying to drown each other in the mud. Then it changes to Lincoln who's listening to the soldiers. In the further course of the movie there are a few other war scenes but the majority of the film is Lincoln trying to get 'yes' votes for the 13th amendment. This is the part where it starts getting a bit boring for me because Lincoln sends people to do the talking for him while he sits at home trying to stop his son from signing up to join the army and listening to his wife complaining.But the way that Daniel Day played as Lincoln was, to me, extremely good. He was humble and friendly but also quite severe and steadfast in his actions. He starts most of his answers with a little tale that mostly contains the answer they're looking for, but Lincoln refuses to tell them directly. This intrigues me, because this is one of the only movies that utilizes stories with life lessons to help solve some problems.In the end this is a very good movie with some interesting things to tell, but it was a bit tedious at some parts and that made it boring. This aside makes it a must see, in my opinion, for everyone that is interested in the civil war and how Lincoln succeeded in abolishing slavery.",8,0,1,24 May 2016
