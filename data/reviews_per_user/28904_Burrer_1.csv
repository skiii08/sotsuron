The Blair Witch Project," Best creep-me-out movie in awhile.
","This was the best 'creep-me-out' movie I've seen in a long time.  The Blair Witch Project is the quintessential horror flick, (or at least one of the best ones ever made).  It demonstrates that true horror lies not with graphic displays of violence.  They show that the best horror/terror resides in a much darker place...your imagination.  Excellent movie - I'm getting this one for home!  Go see it, but not alone.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
