Antz," Clearly (and fortunately), not a Disney movie.
","I liked this movie more than A Bug's Life for the simple reason that it presents a situation: someone with a selfsteem problem. What but this one is the theme of the movie? And I'm sure Disney could never do one like this one.I am not saying Disney's films are bad (Disney has made incredible works like Toy Story or Beauty and the Beast), but, for me, what Antz shows is more valuable... and the special effects are very good.Ah... You don't have to take your kids with you. They maybe won't understand a lot of things.",8,0,0,2 February 2000
Catch Me If You Can," Great
","A great movie. It's not 'the story of how the policeman chases the con artist'. No, it's plenty more: it's a story full of values, of family sense, of lonely people struggling for the meaning of their lives... The story of a man that...WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD ...that fights for his family to be reunited: I mean, Mr. Abagnale is not a lazy person. He just don't take the moral, legal way for achieving what he wants, but this man battles for what he wants. And Mr. Hanratty (another lone person) hardly could be better performed than for Tom Hanks. Great, full of sense. Also, excellent recreation of the 60's and 70's.END OF SPOILERSMy rating: 9/10.Go watch it. You won't be dissapointed.",9,1,2,20 July 2003
Citizen Kane," Very, very good... with a little 'but'.
","Very good movie. A clear idea is expressed. Really, a masterpiece.Nonetheless, it's not very, very fun. Maybe it's because of the epoch.Almost-excellent for me: 9/10.",9,1,2,9 January 2001
My Neighbor Totoro," A nice movie only for children.
","This movie is very nice. Although the theme is very simple, it's very well drawn and the characters move very well (I got surprised with the animation of the movement of the two girls: they really seem real!)If you're going to watch or buy it, remember it's a movie _for children_. It's designed in that way, and it's great in that way, so don't expect a great story because it hasn't it. If you want something 'serious' go for Kokaku Kidotai, Hotaru no Haka (excellent), Nausicaa, Mononoke Hime (these last two by Miyazaki too) or even one of the Rupan Sansei (Lupin III) saga, instead.My rating: 9/10 (again, as a movie designed for children).",9,1,2,26 April 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," OK, it's good, but not 'Best Movie of History'
","OK. The Lord of the Rings is a great production, one has to admit it, but I felt that it didn't touched my heart (what makes a movie, for me, to be important) (one of the reasons is that there it was only one good acting performance, by Ian Mc Kellen, and, altough very good, not worth of too many awards). The movie is good. It's OK for it to be at the top 250 movies list, all right, but... even better than Schindler's List or The Godfather?My rating: 9/10: read the book, then watch it.",8,0,0,28 December 2001
American Beauty," It lets you without words.
","This one of the movies I have liked the most. It´s outstanding. It lets you speechless. One feels so stupid, so guilty, after it. It shows clearly that you can make your life nonsense so easy, following the 'american dream' lifestyle.It touches your soul, really. It's full of fool and nasty things in a too clean, 'smiley', world. It examines the american paradigma and gives a warning alert.I loved the dancing bag scene. It was, for me, really trascendental.For me, that live in a South American country, it made that I appreciate that we still have feelings, and that we're still a romantic, somewhat dreamy world, thanks to God.",10,1,2,29 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," It begins very good, but...
","Yes, it begins nice, weird, strange, creative. They show you a nice main character you like from the beginning. The first 3/4 parts of the movies, I was thinking about giving it a 10/10 in the IMDB... ...but... God! What did they do with the last quarter of the movie?SPOILERS (I think they're) AHEAD!!!Why did they let it be so sad? Why did they let our main character inside that girl without a real family? Oh, how sad! And it began so good, so happy. Hey, we liked the puppeteer!!!END OF SPOILERS.7/10. Good, but it could be better.",7,0,0,15 January 2001
Pearl Harbor," Not too bad, not too good.
","The problem with this movie is that it pretends to be too US american, so there are scenes too silly ,like..._________WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD_____________ ...like:1) The USA flag into the water, next to the bodies of dead soldiers.2) The american black man hero, never discriminated.3) The super soldiers 'killing'em-all' (God, they were a thousand against two and they didn't even touched them!)4) The lack of reference to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the real reasons that made japaneses resign.5) The ending (of course US 'America' had to win and the love triangle to dissolve).There're a thousand more, that make the movie very bad. The best part is when japanese attack. The worst, when 'americans' attack (wasn't the movie too long yet at that moment)?_________END OF SPOILERS_____________
4/10",4,0,0,28 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Good, but not THAT good.
","Yes, it's a nice movie... But it doesn't worth ten oscars! 8/10 for me. Nice effects... Not very easy to read for an american (a person of the continent).Any way, I recommend it. You may find again the meaning of the word 'honor'.",8,0,0,12 March 2001
The Game," A great suspense film
","This is the suspense movie I have most liked. It keeps you stuck to the chair right up until it ends. The actors do a great job.  But, befere you see it, don't let anyone tell you what is it about! You'll lose the entire movie!",10,0,1,19 January 2000
Men in Black II," MIB Ii or 'how to destroy a legend'.
","C'mon? What happened? We were expecting an intelligent, or at least, 'average' plot. MIB I was an story where everything fitted quasi-well, but this? Oh, no. Awful, terribly awful. C´mon, save your money, rent the first one and buy the kids some ice cream.4/10, and I'm being too merciful.",4,0,0,14 July 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," Quite good
","This is a very good movie. I recommend you that before watching it, erase from your mind all you've heard about 'anime' (Mecha, robots, flying people fighting with super powers, etc.) Just sit there, forget everything and enjoy the movie.And, besides, this is a VERY realistic movie, very well drawn. You won't find anything in it that excuses the animation except little Setsuko behavior.It's more that a sad story, a real story, because...________ WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD _______________ ...because Isao Takahata (or Akiyuki Nosaka) shows us not two heroes nor two people which behavior should be followed as if they were. In fact, I think Seita could have done more: he could have worked in something (when you live in a Third-World country you see poverty situations like this every day, and how people struggles with them, not letting themselves die...). Seita and Setsuko are two very, very, very well represented cases of normal people... Actually, everyone (Seita's aunt, for example) and everything drawn in this movie is very very like real life.________ END OF SPOILER _______________
Rent it or buy it. It's one of the best animated movies I've seen. Disney hasn't (and maybe won't) do something like this movie. 9/10.",9,2,3,9 April 2001
A Bug's Life," It's not SO good.
","I think this movie is not so good. I mean: it doesn't deserve (for me) to be into the 250 best movies. It's funny, OK. The effects are right, OK, but it has not other message than the characteristic old-fashioned Disney's concept of 'funny things'.It's very different when you see other movies like Fantasia,  Toy Story or Antz, that are clearly innovative, not only because of their special effects, but because of what they 'tell': at least, they 'transmit' an idea to the viewer.",7,0,0,2 February 2000
Big Fish," Mmm... Good, but not that good.
","It's a nice movie. I mean, the scripts is nice, there are some interesting moments, but I didn't fell trapped by the story. I expected much more. Nonetheless, it's worth the watching. Good, but definitelly overrated. 8/10",7,0,0,21 February 2004
Groundhog Day," This is a comedy!
","This is, with 'As good as it gets' one of the best comedies I've seen. As another person commented, it's much more than a comedy: Groundhog Day is also a reflection about the seven capital sins and shows clearly that people are here for much more than enjoying with, say, pleasures. Phil discovers the only way to be happy, the way in which life has a sense.And it's REALLY, REALLY funny...",10,1,2,19 January 2000
Shrek," What a BAD film!!!
","I can't believe this movie is at the top 100 movies of history list!
How can something so full of silly, predictible, brain-dead gags, be there? As someone told, the story doesn't make sense. The humor is nasty and cruel (what about the beginning? Yuck! And the cookie man without legs! Oh!) 'Shrek' also kicks the butt of _all_ the stories, but not because it is good, but because the characters of these stories appear fooled in a way that really hurts to those of us that love fairy tales.I do not recommend it. If you're definitely going to watch it, do your kids a favor: don't bring them to this movie if they're younger than 13! Even for me (25) it was.... oh, God! Rent Toy Story 1 or 2, Majo no Takkyubin (Kiki's Delivery Service) or Beauty and the Beast instead. Those are animated pieces of art!Ah, and of course 'Shrek' is going to win an Oscar! This has been really a 'cruel summer'.Don't watch this movie if you want to keep a clean soul and a clean mind, or unless you watch the animation (although Toy Story's is much better).
Don't watch it! It's very bad, nasty and stupid!!! It should be at the worst animated movies, instead of Warner Bros. version of 'the King and I'.Don't watch it, please! You'll feel that you've lost the treasure of innocence!My rating: 4/10, and only because i really like animation!",4,2,4,6 July 2001
The Matrix," Entire world: forgive me: I didn't like it.
","Well, what's the big deal? Dragon Ball-like special effects? The emancipation of selfishness as the greatest 'virtue'? CÂ´mon, you don't learn anything from this movie. It's bubble gum for the eyes: useless. The only interesting idea is that about that reality is not what we think. Well, I liked the quid and spider-like robots. But, the story? Bah: nobody helps nobody in this movie (above all, that super-egocentric 'Neo' character). And, oh, yes, it's TOO violent, much, much more than what it needed (bullet showers and destroyed buildings were what this pacific world was needing, isn't it?). If you think you are the center of the world, you will love The Matrix. I didn't.If you want a really good sci-fi movie, go for 12 Monkeys.2/10",2,2,7,10 September 2002
