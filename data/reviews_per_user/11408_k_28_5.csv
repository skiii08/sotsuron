Changeling," Great Movie but only in pieces
","I am not really sure why Eastwood would ruin a perfectly great script. This is an incredible script ; great acting and a superb cast and still it fails to leave a lasting impact. This is a great movie but only in pieces ; there are some scenes where you can actually get a lump in your throat or a rage against system or utter shock but after that emotions director doesn't build upon it but cut abruptly. Its like snapping a perfectly romantic & emotional scene with a fart. I felt sad because this movie could have been so much great; its an unbelievable story of courage , love & compassion . But the artificial attempts to 'de-melodramatise' had an adverse impact of missing continuity and broken bonding with the characters of the movie.I think someone like Steven Spielberg could have done more justice to this story ; as in parts it reminded me that this could have been like his 'Schiendler List' .",6,1,1,10 April 2015
Interstellar," Interstellar ...a disappointment of Galactic proportions!!!
","Interstellar is not a bad movie by Hollywood standard but its a terrible movie by the standard Nolan has set for himself . It's also nothing great compared to any other Hollywood movie ...not even in special effects ...the whole movie experience comes to being an average viewing .But for the fans of Nolan this could be huge disappointment!! This movie at least confirms that Nolan is no 'son of Kubrick' and compared to '2001 A Space Odyssey' this is a massive failure . I did not expect the movie to make sense in every scientific terms but at least it should make logical sense within the parameters set by story itself ; for example 'Inception' was the movie which made perfect satisfying sense in this regards. 'Intersteller' is a gigantic failure; sadly with so many open plot holes (or potholes?) it looks a like Bruce Willis movie viz. why exactly human race shunned technology , what's that dust cloud all about , who done all this and why & how he came back from black hole etc. ; But even if one leave them apart ; as a movie there is no strong story to connect audience to , the father daughter relationship simply fades away in between , and all the action sequences has irritating jarring music in background which instead of increasing tension makes u feel dizzy with nausea...and some totally underdeveloped characters like spaceship crew members and many others unnecessary characters like Doctor Mann .The biggest drawback of this movie is its hardly original at all , the story is something you have already read thousand times in any comic book or seen as a child in any space series or other such shows and of course shown so many times earlier in different format too. One may even call it a poor adaptation of Inception itself as main story line of coming back to family from abyss resonates to Inception but while you feel for Copp in inception you don't feel same way for Cooper!! The absolute lack of creativity even in special effects is biggest disappointment of this movie and coming this from Nolan makes it even sadder. Anyone could have directed this script and with somewhat similar result and such a typical Hollywood endings. Where is the Nolan stamp in this movie? I don't know if this is 'end of Nolan ' as we knew it but both TDKR and Intersteller seemed like a cut paste job of directing with many sequences of juxtaposition simply did not work . The movie fails to deliver as a singular object of artistic vision and fails to make any impact. This may be case of Hollywood studios overriding vision of director but if Nolan too has conceded to studio pressures it then it's the biggest disappointment of all .The problem with this movie isn't really that it does not make any logical sense but that it doesn't connect you emotionally to any of the characters in the movie. Its a very shallow movie experience which makes you feel somewhat jaded at the end. But the worst part about the movie is despite being the movie about space ; this doesn't really make you feel inside a space even if you are watching it in IMAX 70mm !! watching a documentary on space travel may make you feel more awe or just watch 'Gravity' or '2001 Space Odyssey' again !",5,3,7,16 November 2014
Mulholland Drive," And it makes perfect sense as a Love Story Or as Last Dream of Broken Soul !!
","Like everybody else i didn't understand he movie when i saw it first time...and i wasn't sure what it really meant. But there was something else that mattered more to me than literal meaning what the film is about . And it was that experience...it was scary..surreal ...dreamlike ...n haunting...like having a lucid dream..you cant get this feeling out of your head even after you finished watching it. And that's pure cinema ...its about affecting people at deepest corner of their emotional core...at their desires n subconscious mind something with they themselves can not explain or articulate but still feel it and feel it very intensely. This movie was was like that..expressly effective though i must say i found it scary first time around. I normally never find any 'ghost movies' or 'gory movies' scary ; what really scares me psycho thrillers ..and this was perhaps best psycho thriller since 'The shining'.But when i saw the movie second time my views were changed. The scariness was gone and you feel like watching a tragic love story. The sweetest love story of young girl filled with innocence and dreams in her who is broken in her soul...who is wants to love and be loved but instead gets cheated n hurt . Who is desperate to have a moment of happiness in her life but not sure is she will ever get it. Thats as tragic as it can get but just like eerie and surreal atmosphere affects you ..the sad tragedy of her life (which is using 'Hollywood ' as atmosphere here) affects you. At some level it is story of all of us ...big dreams shattered by harsh realities of unknown harsh materialistic entities of 'big world'which we never really understand as its always faceless ..(represented by the mafia shown in movie as formless , shapeless , incomprehensible but still affecting everything that she did). The mafia doesn't go out to hurt Betty ...they don't even know her ...but her life , her dreams , her love is shattered as unintended or indirect consequences of their actions. Doesn't that sound familiar to our life? some random act somewhere done by someone have a far reaching impact on our life which we were not even responsible for. This is what the song 'Na He banda' perhaps means...no one one is playing the music ...its all going on ; while we live in an illusion that we control our life , in reality we being there or not being there doesn't really matter...music goes on. We control nothing about it ..we are as helpless and inconsequential about our own life like puppets in a show. Someone somewhere else is plotting our life and we have no clue who is doing it.The second aspect of this broken soul is loss of love. She wants to love and be loved back and what hurts her is not just that she lost her love but also got betrayed and person who cheated her doesn't even care about hurting her. Its like she takes some ghoulish pleasure is rubbing her wounds by kissing others inf front of her . That is as painful as it can get for someone who loses her love. Its not just feeling of losing love but anger at oneself for being with someone who never cared about you. Who doesn't care if you are hurt but instead enjoys it, the guilt , shame , frustration , agony of being with such a person is unbearable. It makes u hate yourself ..and see yourself as not being treated a human but a toy..a sex toy at worse...used n thrown. It is that despair n pain that prompts the ultimate desire to ease suffering by freeing the broken soul from this body. And that's what she does.What would any person think of just moment before they kill themselves? That I wish I had another life..A beautiful life ...where all my dreams had come true..in a parallel universe i am happy AND satisfied !! Where person i like is so dependent on me that he/she loves me unconditionally. (and hence altered reality lover Rita who is totally in love with her) That everybody loves me for my talent. That all my dreams are withing reach ( so successful auditions) , that anyone who hurts me gets punished for their karma (so director getting beaten up, being cheated n bullied) and everyone cares about you, likes you (so all nice people meeting Betty while they r rude to Diane). The movie is about the last dream of a broken soul. Its a sweet tragedy of broken dreams n broken hearts that ultimately makes you cry since you know this can be story of any one of us.To me this movie makes perfect sense, every single shot of it as this is exactly how I would feel about the life I wished I had, had I been killing myself. First time as i saw it as a mystery but when i saw it again as love story in a dream, it made a satisfying viewing! Something which cant be captured in words but only be felt ..and be felt right at our subconscious level.",10,5,7,13 July 2015
Into the Wild," A Liberating Film
","'Into The Wild' is a truly beautiful & liberating film ; it liberates one,s soul from the mundane material excesses of life. Based on true story of Christopher Mccandless , a young at age of 23 leaves everything behind in his pursuit of happiness , happiness as he seek in truth , purity & freedom from society (or rather its lies & hypocrisies) . If there is one movie which one can watch a million times & still feel inspired every single time , then 'Into the Wild' along with 'The Shawshank Redemption' has to be there. Both are stories of eternal optimism of life & freedom of soul. The only difference between two is one if fictional while other true story.What makes this movie so special is not just acting from Emile Hirsch which is simply superb , but also its director Sean Penn. He penned movie in narratives of his sister which are heart wrenching & are spoken with such bare essences that one could feel the pain of Chris. There are numerous others who had given memorable performances in their 5-10 mins screen time (Stuart & Hal Holbrook in particular) , which is essentially a director,s feat.I always felt envy of those people who can live their dreams. It doesn't really matter what that dream is , as long as those who want it , have courage to go that path , not caring about anyone or anything ,are happiest people on this planet. Very few could do so. One of the most amazing lines in movie is ''career is a 20th century invention' , we increasingly define life in terms of material gains , gadgets , property , money etc. never realizing , money is a means to an end & not an end in itself . & in running after the means we lose our ends.The movie is for you if you are the one who feels pain by the lies....if you are not a believer in 'surviving life' and believe in 'living life' or you really know there difference between these two; Chris did....he wanted a true life ...he was sad man when he had 'all that ' which he left behind and was much happier when he was penniless... Its a journey inside a soul with the vessel of nature to live a beautiful & positive life. A must watch.",10,1,4,15 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Seriously , who directed this movie?
","I am not even trying to compare this movie to first two of the serious coz thats a futile attempt but seriously who directed this movie? Is he the same man who direct TDK and movies like Inception & Mememto ? I cant believe it? This is way toooooo stupid & too shallow to belong to any sensible director!!! I think Nolan must had taken paycheck while some second unit was doing its shooddy job ...in 18/19century some well known writers including Alexander Dumas at times used to employ army of 'assistant writers' who will write while they publish in their name ; are we seeing something like that? This movie , its story ..its annoying music ..hollow characters n stupid story sequences are way too irritating n too much insulting to even a donkey faced audience. If The Dark Knight was highest point in the superhero movie history , this gotta be the lowest ebb since it came from someone whom the world saw as Kubrick's Son !!!! Still cant believe those who adore the movie .....are the sarah palin types growing at such a phenomenal rates in USA? Do they even ustand what a movie is?",1,8,17,18 November 2012
