Ghost," An undying love story
","I really like this movie. Call it a Chick Flick but I think men would cry too, if they weren't taught to be so macho. Whoopee did a good job. It makes you think true love never dies. Do ghosts really exist? The last scene was truly touching.",Null,1,1,27 February 1999
Titanic," There's an unsinkable ship in every house!
","When I got out of the theatre, I did not realize this movie was three hours long. I am not saying it was boring. Leonardo and Kate just captivate you. He is so handsome! and she beautiful. The cinematography in this movie was great. It's like you're there! No wonder it won all those Oscars. And for the old Rose (Gloria Stewart) to tell the story was really moving. This is just a little insight, I work for a popular retail store and when this movie (video) came in, it sold out quickly. That's why I say 'There's a unsinkable ship in every house'. Great Movie!",Null,1,2,17 February 1999
