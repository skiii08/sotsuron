Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Hasn't Aged A Day
","This film greatly exceeded my expectations. I've heard that it's a technical milestone in films but I did not expect it to stand up and still look amazing over 30 years on. I can't even believe the amount of work that's gone into creating this film, even the tiny details like paper moving when a toon sits on a stack or even the shadows cast on them to make them go from looking like a novelty to something that not only looks impressive but real within the world. Furthermore, the script and the directing was very much on point, with tiny details in the background or clever puns that take a second to realise, leading to some genuine belly laughs at points. Furthermore it is a very good mystery, with clues red hearings and a satisfying reveal at the end, which was all masterfully directed by Zemeckis. Defiantly recommend a watch, it's worth seeing Bob Hoskins sing and dance alone.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
The Godfather: Part II," A little dated but still holds up
","You can see why this is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. The story, the script, the directing and the acting is on point. It's almost poetic in the way it carries itself. It's a very good character study of Michal corleone and creates this comparison between him and his father Vito as one built the family and the other is trying to maintain it. Filmmaking has changed very much from the 70s and that is clear in this film, as it's slow paced to the point of stopping entirely at moments. Most of the time it worked but some of the time it dragged a little. Furthermore it's a very dialogue heavy film, meaning you need to pay close attention to everything, which in a three hour film is a little different at times. Despite this, it's clear why this is hailed as such a good film, as it's one of the best examples of the continuation of a story from its predecessor. It very effectively shows the struggles this man has with both maintaining g his reputation and his personal life and both performances by De niro and pachino show this struggle between the cold calculating side and the emational side. Would recommend a watch, that is if you have the time.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," War bad, war very bad
","What a film. It's one of those films that leaves you speechless at the end because your still trying to process what the hell just happened. Defiantly the best war film I have ever seen. It was both a spectacle and a horror. It's fucking haunting, seeing all this destruction. What coplla manages extremely well is creating chaos that we experience through the eyes of the protagonist. There's incredible set prices like the bridge and the city that play with light and fog to create this dreadful atmosphere and a visually striking picture that left me completely flabbergasted as to how they achieved this all in 1979. It's impossible to talk about this film without mentioning marlon Brando. He may be a crazy method actor but by god does it work here. He's shrouded min mystery both literally and figuratively, lit by shadows and shrouded in fog after the nearly 2 hour build up to his character and so after all this hardship and trauma they face getting to him, this performance is built up and resolved perfectly. I realise I watched the shorter version and there's a three hour version out there but one of my only criticisms is that he's only in it for around 10 minutes. Even so, it leaves a massive impression on the viewer which is what makes it so iconic.
Another massive contributor to this errie and haunting atmosphere is the soundtrack, splicing classical music to rock to the main oppressive synth score creates this mismatch of tones and styles that runs throughout.
Despite being surreal and horrific in places, it never stops feeling realistic, keeping this tangible horror of the story. Speaking of, this is a prime example of how to adapt a classic book to a different time period, taking the novel heart of darkness into the Vietnam war shows that this idea of savages and humans, ya and them still relates to this day, the vietnam war ending only around ten years from when the film was made.
All in all, war bad- war very bad",9,0,0,4 May 2020
Coco," Pixar has done it again
","Pixar have done it again. An absolute artistic masterpiece that plays your heartstrings like a guitar. This film is absolutely gorgeous, with some shots leaving me absolutely stunned. Everything about this film is brilliant, the acting the music, the writing all were on point. I especially loved the design and the fluidity of the character, and how they flow and move really satisfyingly, or how accurate the playing of the guitar is.
The story hits all the highs and lows you'd expect from a Pixar film, with twists and turns and highly enotional moments that make it handy to keep a box of tissues near.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Shrek 2," Holds up but lacks in some areas
","Haven't watched this film for a good number of years and coming back to it it holds up well. The animation still looks good and there's no uncanny valley stuff with the mocap. The moral seems good carrying over from the first film but generally the films decent. There's some character building but far less than the original and in places some of the characters are just unlike but these moments are small. There were some jokes that made me belly laugh but most of them were just kinda there, with one or two cringe moments. But it's a fun film to have on in the background. Gingy's still the best character and will always be, FIGHT ME.",6,0,1,7 April 2020
Goodfellas," Scorsese at the top of his game
","A Scorsese classic. It ticks all the boxes. Italians, gangsters, lots of fbombs, the lot. It's very well directed and the style changes throughout the film which compliments the narrative, e.g. romanticised and flowing at the beginning to jerky and unrhythmic at the end. The acting was also fantastic with everyone pretty much becoming a stereotype, especially joe Pesci. The script was tight as well, with a great twist at the ending. however I felt like his downfall cane a little too quickly and it ended quite abruptly. Other than that it made gangster life seem kinda appealing...
Other than all the killing stuff",8,0,0,27 April 2020
