The Avengers," Thor
",In the movie The Avengers I saw Thor on the title of the movie. Before i heard of the movie I watched the movie Thor and I really liked the movie !!!!SPOILER HERE FOR THE MOVIE THOR!!!! In the ending of Thor he destroyed a bridge that connected to a pad and with that pad you could travel to different locations like Earth. There is only 1 travel pad in the movie. So my question is how can Thor be in the movie when it clearly showed him destroy the bridge near the end of the movie to save his city. Please tell me how this is possible. If you have not watched the movie Thor I would really recommend watching it. It is a really good movie they did a good job on it.Thanks,10,1,4,3 May 2012
