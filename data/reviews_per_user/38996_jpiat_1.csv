The Blair Witch Project," Proves you really do need a script to make a movie.
","I was very excited about seeing this movie . . . until I did.What made these people think you could make a movie without a script?  And apparently without a cinematographer, a sound mixer or a lighting director?Think about it.  These kids are supposed to be film students.  So how come half of the footage is out of focus or pointing in a meaningless direction or just plain cockeyed?  My ten year old son shoots better video.And whatever happened to plotting a story.  Try to find the mid-point in this story.  You can't.  I doubt the director even knew when they'd reached the mid-point, let alone the end of act two.Character development?  Character arc?  Totally non-existent!  I watched this movie beginning to end and never felt anything about any of the characters.  I mean . . . JEEEEZ! Three people lost in the woods?  This movie should have been ALL ABOUT the characters!  Otherwise, who cares what happens to them?If you enjoyed this, you enjoyed it.  What can I say?  Maybe you don't get out much.  But if you haven't seen it yet, please! Stay home.  Don't encourage these guys.",2,0,2,4 August 1999
