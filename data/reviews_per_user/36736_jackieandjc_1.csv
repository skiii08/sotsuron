The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I am a teary person but i shed but i cleared a lot of tears off my face
","It was a very well made movie, i started watching the Movie & read the book which i finished in 5hrz. i was into it perhaps the movie made me wanna read the book more. It a really interesting way of writing a book. I'd encourage for anyone to read the book & Watch the movie. I thought Emma Watson looked really good, Hot even & I loved Logan here...Ezra was just good, great even.It hurt because i found relations to it, perhaps that's why i cried. that moment when Sam (Emma Watson) touches Charlie's lap (Logan Lerman) with that look in his eyes i knew something was wrong & i cried.Some of the songs are a good pick, some are just Duh!Asleep by The Smiths (Oh Lovely track)Love always JC",9,7,10,15 November 2013
