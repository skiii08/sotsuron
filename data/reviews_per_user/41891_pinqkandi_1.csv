Requiem for a Dream," Good first hour... and down hill from there.
","Requiem for a Dream is one of the worst movies I've seen. It starts off well, but it quickly goes down hill. There's essentially no ending, and it eventually loses any plot (Which there wasn't much of to begin with). It's also disturbing, but not in a good way. If you want to see a movie about druggies, see Trainspotting.",1,3,11,23 August 2003
