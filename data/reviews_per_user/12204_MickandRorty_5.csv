It," Fun movie, terrifying with frequent comedic relief
","I would like to start off by saying that the original scared me when I was a kid, but re-watching it...the mini series is pretty awful. Let's just be honest. This one exceeds the original on every level. Not even close. This is the best horror film of 2017, and the best horror remake to date.It's 'shape-shifting' is genuinely scary in this one, as opposed to downright corny in the mini-series.It was much bloodier than I expected. Perfectly cast. I wish we got a little bit more backstory from the Jewish kid. The rest of the characters were developed well.Creepy adults. Very nightmarish. I loved it. Best horror flick since 'It Follows'.",9,6,16,7 September 2017
Hereditary," Scariest Horror Film In Recent Memory
","I highly recommend going into this movie not knowing anything about it, as I did. The movie is terrifying and does not use any jump scare tactics. You will squirm in your seat as you notice details going on in the background. The camera work/cinematography was incredible. An all-around fantastic horror movie that is sure to become a classic. It will stick with you and you will continue to analyze scenes in your head. I will definitely watch this one more time when it comes to bluray. 10/10",10,6,14,11 June 2018
Bird Box," The Happening Meets The Quiet Ones With Some of The Mist Sprinkled On Top...But, It's Not Good
","The main Sandra Bullock character was not likable in the very least. The movie started off just fine, very The Happening-esque. Then it drags and drags until a very unsatisfying 'ending.' It's actually incredible how little character development there really is for how long the run-time is. I mean, you'll ask yourself at the end....'What do I know about ANY of these characters?' Nothing. It's some lazy writing and/or rewrites. And, I am not sure what the fate of a couple characters in the film are....was it written off? Why? Also, there is a very big goof in the general premise of the movie, just check the goofs page if interested. Not good. 4/10. Acting was good. Writing...not so much.",4,10,23,25 December 2018
Get Out," Excellent Little Nightmare Put into Film
","Jordan Peele crushed his debut. I saw this film with 5 people and not a single one of us 'disliked' it. 7's or better across the board. This movie was a fun, little nightmare. I only assume that this is a reoccurring nightmare for Mr. Peele, which is both hilarious and terrifying.A very unconventional, satirical horror gem. You will laugh. But, the jokes are so subtle that the laughter does not distract from your terror and curiosity of 'what the hell is going on, here?!' 8/10 - Loved it!",8,6,18,26 February 2017
Life," Brought Nothing New to the Horror / Sci-fi Genres
","The character development felt a little rushed, but I am glad they did not drag it out. There was not a single ounce of originality in this. 'Gravity' Meets 'Alien' meets 'The Thing' meets 'Jeeper's Creepers.'The writing was pretty awful at times. 'Goodnight cow, goodnight moon, Goodnight air...air?? Air!!'Really guys? SMHIt has some really cool CGI, but the emotional deaths did not feel very 'emotional.' This is worth a watch if it's free to stream on Netflix....but I have buyer's remorse for paying to see this in the theater. I wish I had seen Belko instead :( (Not that that has a shred of originality either)",5,5,13,25 March 2017
