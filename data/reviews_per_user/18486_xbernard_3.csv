Deja Vu," typical Tony Scott vehicle (which is not necessarily a bad thing)
","Denzel Washington plays an ATF agent being sent on a terrorist attack site and assigned to a special and secret FBI team to maybe, possibly, go back in time and avoid the incident to occur. He plays his character straight forward without frills and thereby, I guess, finds the right note in such preposterous story.I had a problem with the following: Washington's character's transition from meticulous cop to action superhero is too sudden. Also, his character seems like a nice and caring and, again, meticulous guy and, yet, once behind the wheel, he causes so many accidents and damages, putting many other people's lives in danger, without looking back even once. He does request paramedics to be sent on one of those crash sites but you don't see the call being made. This is something recurrent in Batman movies, for example, and has been parodied by the 'Hancock' movie.Nevertheless, this being a Tony Scott movie, you know what to expect: a good-looking no-brainer where you ought to just relax and enjoy the show. That's all it intends to be and does perfectly.",7,0,1,23 May 2011
Blood Diamond," DiCaprio is the diamond and there's a lot of blood
","Once again, DiCaprio demonstrates he is one of the most interesting and talented actors. He's never shied from difficult roles (think Who's Eating Gilbert Grape?, 'This Boy's Life' and just about every part played in the 21st century). You can see his attention to detail and dedication to the part, the intensity of his acting. In this case, his use of a local African accent is, to my ears, flawless.As to the movie, well, compared to 'Hotel Rwanda', it still looks more like 'Con Air Goes To Africa'. Nevertheless, the character development is interesting even if obvious and the movie is well paced, so you never get bored. Djimoun Hounsou is a Mende fisherman. His village is attacked by the Revolutionary United Front and he is captured in order to search for diamonds to be traded. DiCaprio is a white Rhoedsian mercenary smuggling diamonds. They will both at some point meet in jail and DiCaprio will find out Hounsou has hidden a diamond worth millions of dollars. They will start a journey together, trying to recover the hidden diamond and Hounsou's family that was taken to ca camp. They will try to arrange an escape to America for both the family and the diamond.The depiction of the cruel African attacks owe more to 'Saving Private Ryan' than reality, which is a shame, but then, this is a fiction that only uses African conflicts as a backdrop to what the DiCaprio's character has to go through along with Djimoun Hounsou, even if the movie is billed as being about the blood diamond trades.",7,0,1,24 May 2011
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," greatly involving and feels authentic
","1920: Two Irish brothers, Damion O'Donovan (played by Cillian Murphy) and Teddy O'Donovan (PÃ¡draic Delaney) join the IRA to fight for independence.I thought at first this was going to be just another war drama, but the movie gives a very authentic feeling, and at times I almost forgot I was watching actors. There's a real sense of place, time and mentality.The movie is being clever by not turning the Irish fighters into superheroes but rather as scared and proud people who didn't always agree on what is right to do in terms of justice between themselves. There is a great court scene explaining this very point.In the end, you could say it's also the story of two brothers the war has divided, the way it has divided their whole land. One one side, those fighting for the Free State Treaty, the others fighting against it.",9,0,7,27 May 2011
