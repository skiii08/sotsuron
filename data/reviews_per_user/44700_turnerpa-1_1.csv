Mission: Impossible III," Mission Inconceivable!!
","I'm not entirely sure where to start, I've never written a comment here before but for some reason I feel compelled to do so after watching M:I:3. Anyone who has watched the first two films would no doubt be looking for much of the same only bigger, brasher and louder. Sadly I was mistaken.Maybe because the previous films in the franchise were too good at delivering what we all need in an action type formula or maybe I just expect a little more I found M:I:3 a bit stale.In my opinion the storyline seems to be very thin, coupled with that is a cast of surplus characters with no background or history. This all gives the feeling that you are watching a selection of clips from other plots that really don't seem to flow. Take out the few CGI assisted stunts that we've already seen hundreds of times over in the trailers and TV spots and you essentially have a 2 hour episode of 24.More surprisingly, considering it was opening night, the cinema in the UK's capital was barely a third full and once word of mouth starts to spread, I'm pretty sure many of them will stay that way.If you don't already own them, I'd strongly suggest buying the previous Mission Impossible DVD's instead of spending on a ticket for this one. However, If you want to watch something completely forgettable, then you can't do any worse than this.",3,4,8,5 May 2006
