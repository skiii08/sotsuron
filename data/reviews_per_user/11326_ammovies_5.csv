Requiem for a Dream," Shocking and Intense.. Way to Go Darren!
","As a person, I can say that this movie was utterly magnificent! It not only shocking me, but it was trippy! Darren Aronofsky, whose film, Black Swan, I'm still trying and promise never to watch again because it freaked me out! There are some films out, as well as today, that feel like character studies instead of films. Aronofsky is one of those directors who makes character studies. The Fountain was a film about reincarnation, death, and love, Black Swan was a film about the obsession of perfect and trying to lose yourself, The Wrestler was about redemption. Requiem for a Dream, I tell you, walks on the line between loss of one's self and a character piece. The cast is fantastic, the music is intense, the visuals are.. well they're visuals! This movie in my book, is amazing and will shock you to your very core after the film's final moments!",9,0,1,5 January 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Consider this redemption for X-Men
","Not too long ago, I really thought X-Men went off the rails, especially after the last movie. I didn't really care for X-Men: First Class. However, after re-watching Days of Future Past on FXX, I think I was too harsh on the film when it was first released in theaters. If you think about it, it's basically the Terminator set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (YES I'm saying X-Men is apart of the cinematic universe because I'm sick to death of all those dumb asses who call themselves 'true Marvelites' who are saying 'X-men isn't.'). That's the dumpy, pathetic moneymakers at Disney talking. Well, X-men is and always be Marvel's favorites, even as the years wear on. Without spoiling the entirety of the film itself, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a redemption mark for the entire X-Men franchise. Also, it was great to see Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart working together!",7,1,3,7 June 2017
Mr. Nobody," Beautiful & Confusing.. But Makes Up For It with Visuals
","I was scrolling through Netflix the other night and I managed to find this in the film section. I recently finished it and was not disappointing! I was a little confused but the film itself, is NOT disappointing! Jared Leto leads the way to an amazing movie with an amazing cast. I LOVED the visuals, yes it was a little quirky at times, but it's pretty cool! It literally reminded me of Cloud Atlas due to the theme of how one choice can affect what happens in our lives. The themes of love, death, immortality, science, choice, family, independence, mixed with a canvas of story lines, all dispersed throughout the movie, along with an array of indie rock yet vintage music mixed together creates a masterpiece of a film. Without spoiling it, I'd be willing to watch it again and I will say this: If you films like this, I recommend this movie to you!",8,2,3,10 February 2016
There Will Be Blood," There Will be Blood... & LOADS of time to sleep
","2007 was indeed both a good & bad year for films. Then again, 2008 was no better. There Will Be Blood. I came across the flick on Netflix & I gave it a try. I watched it with my dad and I was glad when the credits rolled. The film got so much hype and went on to win a but load of awards at the Academy Awards. Now here are some stuff I didn't mind about the showPros:~ I liked Daniel Day Lewis. He was great in Gangs of New York. When we first meet his character, he's traveling with his son (wait scratch that, it's not really his kid. It's one of his coworker's kid who had died in an accident at his company) and is just desperate to make some money off of some oil drilling ~ It was based off of a book. Yes pretty much all films are nowadays. ~ The final scene. The famous lines 'I drink your milkshake!' as well as 'I'M FINISHED!' that follows after the showdown between a fake priest (played by the over the top Paul Dano who would later go on to play in 2013's thriller Prisoners). The fight was well done, and felt like I was watching a cage fight. Well done screen writers! Cons: ~ Directing. I didn't like the director. Yes the hippie geek himself, Paul Thomas Anderson. The man has not done anything good. Admit it! He was the wrong choice to direct this bloated thriller and needs to retire ASAP! ~ Runtime. The movie was too long. I felt like I was being strapped down and forced to watch this! Even my dad kept saying 'Is it over yet?' The film went on for two and a half hours and was so forced. Cut it down ! Chris Nolan is the only one that can director movies that are over two hours!~ Acting. I didn't have a problem with Daniel Day Louis or Sir Ciaran Hinds since both are my favorite actors. The rest was terrible and cringe inducing. Paul Dano was too over the top and was so stupid in his part! Might as well make me sit on nails Paul !! ~ Music. The music was the worst part of the film! I'm pretty sure it was a straight off copy of The Dark Knight soundtrack, which is known for it's screechy music. Listening to this so called music seriously got way too over the edge, it seriously made me wanna shove nails in my ears and it felt like nails were being dragged on a chalkboard.All and all, this movie is a huge let down. Value your time & watch a Coen brothers film!One outta Ten stars",1,5,10,23 April 2015
Cloud Atlas," A domino effect canvas disguised as a visual achievement
","I was never a fan of the Wachowski siblings growing up, never saw the Matrix or Jupiter Ascending(also known as the movie that killed their collaborative creative). I'm a huge fan of their produced film, V for Vendetta, which before it was released, Natalie Portman gave Lana a copy of the book to read during film, which resulted in them making this magnificent multi story masterpiece. Now I don't like movies or stories that focus on more than one person but this one was different and extremely unique. It's based on the novel and touches upon reincarnation.. You got four to five different story lines going on during the three hour run time of the film, varying in acting, historical times, and even in genre. The actors do magnificent jobs in their multi roles, the make up effects and costumes are breathtaking and mind blowing and the whole 'everything is connected' will change your whole outlook on life once the credits roll! Without spoiling it, this movie is extremely worth the watch more than once! So if you like Blade Runner or the Matrix, then I highly recommend this lovely piece to you!",10,4,5,18 July 2015
