Resident Evil: Afterlife," Actually worse but there isn't a lower rating option.
","I'm not huge fan of the series but I did think the other movies were okay. I never post anything on the web, at all, ever, but this movie is so ridiculously bad that I was compelled to write something. Luckily enough I didn't pay to see this at the theater or rent it. Just now streamed it on Netflix and was angered enough by what I saw in 5 minutes that I felt obliged to warn anyone who might read this before wasting their time. This is a B movie under the guise of a Blockbuster. I suspect the only reason it didn't go straight to DVD is because it was in 3D at the box office. I cannot stress this enough...this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you waste your time with this movie you're a fool. Don't mean to offend. I'm a fool too because I wasted 5 minutes on it. To summarize...NEVER watch this movie.",1,1,5,4 June 2011
