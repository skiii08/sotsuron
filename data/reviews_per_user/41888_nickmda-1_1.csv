Hereditary," From promising to flat out boring.
","Hereditary has had really good PR being billed as the modern day classic horror film you just have to see. The film starts with promise, with some great imagery and acting that really capture the mood and imagination. Then really slows off into a sluggish pace taking forever to try and build some deep an meaningful character background. Unfortunately it ends up dragging out a poorly edited series of coincidences that don't work and just make the film predictable. Then in the final third it hits the wall and the story line descends into a mix of 'that's been done before' and ' let's pick an idea randomly out if a hat'. I looked forward to this movie and was left completely bemused by how it could start with such promise and demise into the claptrap it ended up being. I understand why people want to give good ratings to this film but it only gets a 4 from me. I just hope it ends here and doesn't become a B movie franchise that the ending suggests.",4,3,7,30 June 2018
