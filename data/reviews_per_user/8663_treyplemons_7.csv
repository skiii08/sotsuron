Sucker Punch," hot babes with machine guns= one kickass film
","OK, let me start with saying that if you rate this film any lower than a 7 then you are a complete and total faggot....literally. the storyline is superb, the action is mind-boggling, and the scenery is perfect. I've never heard of this director, but he did a fantastic job. this is a new type of story that hasn't ever really been used before as far as i can tell. and its funny how movies that critics hate, are movies that i love. why? because film critics are liberal idiots. this film has no political standpoint,....its just hot babes shooting machine guns and kickin some ass. great character development (as far as baby doll, sweet pea, and rocket are concerned...idk if thats a spoiler or not)but, honestly, i rate this movie a ten because its really the first of its kind that I've seen, and doesn't deserve to be rated a 6.3.....thats just horrible. not only are critics liberal idiots....their also hypocrites when they say that films need to be original....but then they say that the original ones suck.....so thats why i hold my one finger salute to all critics :)anyways, great movie. definitely watch it",10,9,17,10 July 2011
Source Code," Best 'Twist' Movie Out There
","when i first saw the trailer to this movie, i assumed it was gonna be another one of those movies where jake gylenhall (or however you spell his last name) comes in all romantic, gets the girl and saves the day, with no twists whatsoever. or another 'action flick' where he is a marine and does little to no fighting throughout the whole movie....this movie far outweighed my expectations.whoever the director is, did a great job of twisting this plot up to where you had no idea whats going on, then slowly untwisting it at the best possible moment. my jaw dropped a few times and i said 'no way!!'. at one moment, i forgot i was in the theatre and yelled out 'dayummm!!' when some dude got punched in the face...(not a spoiler, every movie has people getting punched' but,...regardless to what a lot of the losers on this site have to say about this movie, i thought it was great. a lot of people rate movies too harshly and wont enjoy them half of the time. i definitely recommend this movie to people thinking about watching it",9,0,1,10 April 2011
Tangled," Disney did it again!
","I can tell you right now, I didn't want to see this movie because I am an 18 year old male who loves gory action flicks. My girlfriend forced me to go, and the only reason i went was because I knew Zachary Levi was starring in it, and I watch him in Chuck, definitely one of my top 5 favorite actors. anyways, I left the movie with that warm fuzzy feeling inside. This movie was amazing in every aspect. Disney just knows how to bring our inner children out. The musical composition is outstanding, and Mandy Moore nails the singing of Repunzel perfectly. I smiled each time I heard her sing. and Zachary Levi has a fine voice too, i never saw that in him.The animation is very well done as well, Repunzel is beautiful, and Flynn looks like the typical Robin Hood.Point being is that this movie took my breath away, I absolutely recommend that you go see this film if you truly love Disney.",10,8,10,28 December 2011
Kick-Ass," most bad-ass and funniest movie I've seen in awhile
","when i went to see kick-ass, i thought for sure that it was gonna be another one of those awful spoof movies.....what i watched was definitely no spoof, it was mind-blowing.the director of this film did a superb job of casting, i honestly don't think he could have done better. Nicholas Cage does an amazing job of acting, like always, and really pulls you into the story. and whoever the kid who plays kick-ass himself is, he deserves an award because he did fantastically. now, this film was nominated for a few trophies at the scream awards, but, due to all the little weird goth kids, only queer movies dealing with vampires won anything. so i was very disappointed about that because i was sitting on the edge of my seat, hoping this film would win something.its very good to finally see that a film i like gets an honest rating.i only gave this 9 stars instead of 10 mainly because some of the 3d compositing in the film looks a tad bit cheesy. but, it still looks good. not incredibly noticeable.all in all, this is a fantastic film that I'm sure you will very much enjoy",Null,3,7,24 July 2011
Super 8," simply amazing and easy to connect with
","im gonna start out with saying that i don't ever really go see movies twice.....with that being said, i went and saw this 3 times,..thats how good it was. i was very surprised since due to the trailer i though it was going to suck,...im so glad i was wrong.the visual effects are amazing, the acting and directing are superb, and they shot it in a way to where the audience could really connect to the story.the suspense, the action, the stories, the emotion,...it all really hit me hard and i got sooooooooo into it.for me, the kids made the movie. plain and simple. without them, this would have been your typical 'oh hey! lets go do some sci/fi action!' kind of movie. J.J. Abbrams did a fantastic job of writing for these kids, and they did an even better job of playing it out. the banter that goes back and forth will make you laugh pretty hard, without a doubt, unless your one of those hard core critics that nobody likes. this film is without a doubt, a SOLID 10. i actually want to go see it a 4th time to be honest, the fact that its only a 7.7 is appalling. If you think this movie sucks, you don't know a good film. plain and simple.",10,1,3,20 July 2011
Limitless," eh...it was alright
","ill keep this short...my girlfriend decided that i chose movies for us too often..so...i let her choose one....she definitely didn't do a very good job. i mean, this movie is ALRIGHT, it isn't bad, but it ain't good either. it isn't Bradley Coopers best movie to be honest. i mainly did a lot of clock watching on this movie.The idea of super intelligence isn't really used all that much, so to that point, this movie is very original. its a great idea, just poorly executed. (like the X-box game 'Homefront') if your into this kind of thing, i suggest going to see it, if not, don't bother with it. you wont really be all that impressed by it, but, thats just me personally. like i said, im not saying it sucks, but it isn't the best. and ill leave it at that.",5,1,3,10 April 2011
Inception," A dream inside a dream inside of my dreams....
","The reason I named this review the way I did is because I've fallen asleep watching this turd of a film so many times that I don't dare to count anymore, my brother unfortunately loves it so I'm forced to watch it. They shoulda paid me to come see this crap, because I want my money back. For starters,......a dream in a dream in a dream?.....you couldn't think of a better way to say that? It makes the complexity of an already complex movie even more so by adding demensions that I just do not give a flying crap about. When I go to see a movie, I don't like having to work to understand it. I didn't leave WORK early to come home, get dressed, and take my girl out to WORK, we came to see a movie. This movie will mind rape you, and in the end, the entire theater, (myself included) walking out afterwards scratching our heads and saying, 'what the eff just happened?' This movie did teach me something though,.....it taught me how to not get laid. She hated it, I hated it, no poon for me.So do yourselves a favor, don't listen to the idiot critics on this site, bc their too busy shooting up some black tar heroin to know what they are talking about.....because this movie is absolute trash. 3 stars was being nice",Null,12,21,10 November 2011
