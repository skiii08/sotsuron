Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," overall i thought that this was a pretty hilarious movie...some parts were really stupid though
","Well, I went and saw this movie last night and I must say, coming into the theater, I thought the movie was going to be awful and that it wouldn't be worth the $9.50 i paid to see it. But I have to tell you that this is definitely a movie worth seeing. There were so many parts that were so ridiculous I just couldn't stop laughing. Borat is a pretty funny character, especially with his accent and feeble attempts at speaking English. The one thing I didn't like about the movie was that Jews were made fun of a lot. Honestly I have no problem with the Jewish community, or any other religion for that matter, and I'm surprised that the movie continuously insulted the Jews, for example, blaming them for the attack of 9/11. Overall though I really enjoyed this movie and if you're into stupid comedy documentary movies then this is the movie for you to see.WARNING***: There are 2 naked men seen in a scene of this movie, and what they are doing may not seem very SOPHISTICATED to some.",9,1,6,27 November 2006
