Catch Me If You Can," A light hearted yet polished film
","Going into this movie I was far from excited but I was utterly impressed by how this movie was executed. I knew the acting was going to be solid, you can never go wrong with Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, but they weren't the only superb things about this movie.I was most astounded by how entertained I was during this film. It was brilliantly put together and wildly engaging. To say I was surprised by the bouncy and vivacious screenplay is an understatement. There are scenes that are truly playful, lively and to my surprise, comedic. DiCaprio executes his perky and charming character flawlessly; he handles the vibrant persona with ease. Do I even need to talk about Tom Hanks, I mean, we all know he's a remarkable actor. Amy Adams has a small but very spirited role.I came into this movie because of the actors and came out immensely delighted.",10,9,12,18 March 2014
