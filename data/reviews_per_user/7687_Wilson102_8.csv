The Blair Witch Project," waste of a good Saturday night
","Please, please, don't buy into the hype surrounding this movie. It was pretty darn awful. Let me tell you now; I'm a very squeamish and easily frightened viewer(I practically had a heart attack when a certain little girl crawled out of a certain TV-you know which movie I mean!) but this film did not have me diving behind the sofa cushions. Not even a little bit. It starts out good; the tension is there alright, but because it is set 'film documentary' style there is no atmospheric music to set the scene, which means any tension or atmosphere has to come from the actors. Maybe I'm missing the point, but a bunch of teenagers running around in pitch black woods whispering the 'f' word over and over-and yes folks, a good five minutes is spent where you can't see a darn thing and can only hear the sound effects as the kids drop the video camera and screech terrified obscenities to each other-doesn't really entertain me that much. Even then the volume had to be turned up ridiculously high just to hear what they were saying, then turned down again in disappointment as I realised I wasn't missing much. I found the scene where they emerge from their tents and practically have a hernia over some re-arranged twig formations more funny than ominous. Was anyone else willing the Blair Witch to pop out and say boo? Anything would have been less laughable than twig formations!! It is true that a good horror flick can entertain you not by what it shows, but by what it doesn't, but here is where the movie fails. Had the teens been stalked and chased down by an evil presence then it would have been frightening and entertaining, instead we have three college-age idiots lost in some woods and behaving like hysterical, well, college-age idiots. 'AHHH!! A re-arranged twig formation!!!' Please. Can you say 'low budget?' Give us viewers some credit! And I won't go into the disaster that was ending. Just as the movie builds up some tension and genuinely grips you to the screen, the credits roll. I had to go back to the title menu screen and repeat that scene just to make sure the DVD hadn't skipped. In the words of Comic Book Guy...'Worst Ending EVER'. Bless Heather Donahue, for she was meant for things far greater than this. Well, thankyou for taking the time to read my little review. I beg of you not to waste any more actually viewing this movie, if it weren't for the foul language it would barely make a PG certificate. There are plenty of better chillers out there, and I know children who wouldn't take this flick seriously.",2,4,7,10 September 2009
The Mask," One of the best comedies from the funniest guy in Hollywood
","Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was really the movie that put Jim Carrey on the map. The Mask is the movie that solidified his position as the funniest guy in Hollywood. In The Mask Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss the nice guy who always finishes last. He gets a hold of a mask that once he wears it his innermost desires come to life. Will Stanley let the mask rule his life or will he realize he's great just the way he is. You'll just have to watch the movie to find out. Jim Carrey gave an awesome performance in this movie. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a musical or comedy. He didn't win it, but his performance was definitely good enough to have one it. Ipkiss is in no way Ace Ventura. He isn't the confident wild man that Ace is. He's the nice guy that finishes last that everyone likes. Carrey plays it to perfection. Once the Mask is put on Carrey becomes that wild man that we love so much and thats where the movie really excels. The animation they used for Ipkiss with the mask on is great and Carrey plays the wild man better than anyone ever. He sings, dances, and throws out some of the best one liners ever. Stanley Ipkiss is a great character and thanks to Jim Carrey for making him that. Cameron Diaz is great in the film. This was the movie that introduced us to the formere model. She holds her own real well in the movie. Carrey was so hot when he did this movie riding the success of Pet Detective and she shines in this role. She is absolutely gorgeous throughout the whole film. She's not a bad actress and I really wish she'd do more roles like this. The extras on the DVD are decent. There are some deleted scenes that are alright and the directors commentary is decent as well. The movie can be viewed in full or widescreen format and it features dolby digital sound. I wish they'd done some more with the special features though. They could have done something cool with the music or special effects, but they didn't. The music is great in this film. I have the soundtrack as well and the music helps make this film great. Jim Carrey is great when he dances and sings in 'Cuban Pete.' There are some great swing songs like Royal Crown Revues 'Hey Pachuco played in the movie. This really could be considered a musical in many ways. This is a fantastic film. It's fun the whole family can relate to and is a must own. The DVD is pretty easy to find cheap, so don't miss out on this fun film.",9,1,1,10 September 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What was the point of this, George?
","I remember when this film came out, I kept putting off seeing it. And putting it off, and off. Then it came out on video, and I finally rented it. I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right. It is one of the dullest, most atrociously acted films I've ever seen. The acting was stody and boring, and considering the acting talent involved (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), you'd think Lucas could have done something spectacular with them. Alas, no. Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows. It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadaisical feel that really irks the viewer. Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe). They more than likely felt a sense of obligation and loyalty to see this film and the progressively worse prequels. They grew up with the original Star Wars films, and they went away disappointed and angry at the fact the prequels were inferior in every way to the originals... Lucas's dialogue is wretched, his pacing is totally off, and he seems to be killing time here. There's no real enthusiasm here, in front of the camera or in back of it. Perhaps the actors picked up on the fact that Lucas didn't give a damn about his own film, so why should they? I sometimes think Lucas purposely made bad prequels so he wouldn't have to film the final 3 chapters. And why did he decide to make the prequels? If he made the 3 films that were supposed to take place after Return of the Jedi, he would have had no real creative restraints. Who knows why George Lucas does what he does? I haven't a clue, other than I really disliked this film.",2,29,55,9 September 2009
Catch Me If You Can," A Sincere Con Man Story.
","I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed this movie. The relationship between DiCaprio and Christopher Walken is almost as good as the one between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. The bond between them is not immediately apparent and it is highly unorthodox, but, by the end, you completely believe the friendship that has arisen before our eyes. The plot itself is very interesting, and I have to say that the ending was not what I expected. The film definitely delivers, and, other than 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' this was the first movie that I really liked DiCaprio in. I found his work to be the weak link in 'Gangs of New York.' Hanks, of course, is outstanding once again. Lastly, the film has some very picturesque moments, such as the scene with the 8 old school stewardesses escorting the main character through the Miami airport as Sinatra's song massages our ears in the background. This one is certainly unique as it has a retro, yet not dated, feel to it.",8,1,3,14 October 2008
The Jungle Book," Jungle book, a good movie but not a great one.
","Now before you die hards spew fire at me for giving this movie three stars let me explain myself. Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid children's film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for children's films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own. Just not as good as Peter Pan or Mary Poppins in this consumers honest opinion.",6,3,6,14 October 2008
X-Men," World War X
","In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a 'cure' is found that makes all mutants human. Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the 'cure' will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way. All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films. New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars. If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) in the trilogy, this 3-pack is a great opportunity to see a classic tale in chronological order and own a classic 3-part tale in the genre that belongs in any sci-fi fan's collection. Hugh Jackman is excellent in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all spot-on too. And Famke Janssen is Phoenix whose character is key to the trilogy. Beast is in X3 too, actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammar! Now there's a real mutation! All in all a very entertaining 6 hours of movies here. X fans won't miss these, and you shouldn't either if you're into the action, sci-fi or fantasy genres.",9,0,1,23 October 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Almost 4 stars.... Almost.
","I'd almost like to give this movie 8 stars...but not enough to upgrade my overall rating to 6 stars. The movie had great special effects and I enjoyed the T-X villain, but I felt so cheated by the ending. I also really felt like Cameron should have done more to bring back Linda Hamilton's character. Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new 'John Connor.' What I really hated was how the 'Good' Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie. It leaves you with a very hopeless feeling of the future, unlike T2 in which the viewer was left feeling incomplete but perhaps in a more positive frame of mind. Not a great way to 'end' the series if this is, indeed, Arnie's last foray into the Terminator world.",6,0,0,14 October 2008
Pocahontas," What a world of difference! Excellent! Disney finally gets it right!!
","I just got this 10th anniversary edition today and I LOVE it! The additional scene with the beautiful love song 'If I Never Knew You' brings the movie all together and it makes much more sense with the scene. For years I had heard that there was a 'missing scene' in this movie, and I remember thinking how the original scene in the teepee between Pocahantas and John Smith seemed so abruptly cut short and terribly truncated. About 5 years ago on ABC, The Wonderful World of Disney showed Pocahantas with this 'deleted scene', but it was not complete. At the time it featured 'live' animation of the view of the hole through the top of the teepee, and stills with voice-overs from Mel Gibson and Irene Bedard. The big deal at the time was that it featured Mel Gibson singing, and I remember seeing an interview with Mel at the time saying (sic) 'I got to sing a love song but they cut the scene!' But the funny thing is that I could swear that I read that this scene was complete at the time the original was released, but cut just before the release. (Anyone know about this?) I guess it doesn't matter now because the Disney Co. finally restored this very touching and beautiful song to this anniversary version, and it makes the story so much more real and compelling. There is also a reprise of the couple singing the song just before the end and it is the icing on the cake. I'm not always pleased with Disney DVD releases, but this one they got right! Also, they had the sense to release it in the widescreen ratio so you get to see the whole, beautiful product in all of its glory! (They should do this with all their releases!--How about a widescreen special edition of MoonSpinners? Hint-Hint!) Also, you can watch the original theatrical release on this DVD, but I don't know why you'd want to! P.S. Mel sings beautifully!",9,7,12,15 October 2008
