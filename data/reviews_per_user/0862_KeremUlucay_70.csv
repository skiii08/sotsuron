Ford v Ferrari," BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE
","Ford v Ferrari absolutely deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Film. I think it is one of the best movies of Mangold. Just loved that movie, it has an amazing visuality and sound editing. Bale and Damon made great jobs too. I wish Bale would nominated for Oscar. He deserves, such a talented actor.",8,1,2,28 January 2020
First Man," CHAZELLE DID WELL AGAIN
","Great movie. Its not Damien Chazelle's best for me but I really liked it. Neil Armstrong, such a big man. Movie tells us Neil's journey and relationship with his family and friends wonderfully. We can see world's reaction to this event clearly. My favourite scene is first walk on the moon as you can guess. Cinematography is amazing. Also, Gosling and Foy are truely awesome in their roles. But just let you now, sometimes movie goes slowly.",8,2,6,21 October 2018
The Incredible Hulk," NOT THAT BAD
","Everybody says The Incredible Hulk is the worst part of MCU. Yes, everything is not okay with that movie but it is not that bad. In my opinion, Ed Norton is a great Bruce Banner. Also I like watching him next to Liv Tyler. I think that movie could have more potential if filmmakers would lend an ear to Norton's ideas.",7,0,0,21 January 2020
It," ONE OF THE GOOD PRODUCTS OF MODERN HORROR
",It is a great film which tells its story in a good way. Characters are well written. Fun movie. But I can't say it has something more. It is not so scary but it is not trying to be. Skarsgard's Pennywise portrayal is awesome. All kids have made great jobs too.,7,0,0,3 December 2019
John Wick," BEST IN THIS GENRE
",John Wick is a great action movie with an amazing cinematography. What an opening scene. What a stylish character. What a motivation. It is pretty simple but attractive. They thought every scene very well. Tempo is incredible. Fighting choreographies are intense. Keanu Reeves is so cool. This is the example for how this kind of movies must be.,8,1,1,19 June 2019
Rocketman," CRAZY
","Rocketman is a biopic which preferred to tell its story like a musical. That's awesome because there are some crazy and spectacular scenes. But in second half, it becomes boring. Tempo is great at all but before final sequence it falls. In final, movie shows itself and everything becomes better when we hear Sir Elton John's voice. Taron Egerton is amazing. He lives in the character. Also his singing is so much better than I expected. By the way, lots of people compare Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody and that sounds so normal to me. If I say something about that, although I liked them both, Bo Rhap is better with one or two steps.",7,5,8,27 June 2019
A Star Is Born," CHARMING AND TOUCHING
","This movie is like a journey. It takes you from beginning, it tells you some stories, it touches your heart. Musics and concert scenes are magnificent! Cooper and Gaga do their best. I never thought Cooper can sing as good as that, also I never thought Gaga can act as good as that. Also even it is Cooper's first movie as a director, he did a awesome job. He puts everything on this project. This movie might win few Oscars. But is it perfect? Not it's not. Movie gets slow sometimes but it doesn't comes boring, especially a part of second half. Anyway, 2018 isn't a great year for cinema. 'A Star is Born' is a great choice to spending some time in a theatre for your weekend.",8,2,4,29 October 2018
Captain Marvel," GAME-CHANGER
","Captain Marvel is an important part of MCU these days, both character and movie. It is a bridge between two Avengers movies. Basically, Ant-Man and the Wasp did same job but this one is another point on that. Because it is an origin story in the same time. Its purpose must be introduce and present Carol Danvers. Can this movie does that? Actually, it's not bad at it. Although not everyone is happy with Brie Larson, I love her so much and I think she became a great Captain Marvel. We can vilify this movie about character writing but it is not just Carol Danvers. Nick Fury is weird, Yon-Rogg is not so intense, Talos is not the main villain, Ronan's part is just a cameo, story becomes disorganised on relationships of these characters... I liked whole cast on their roles actually but I couldn't get what I wanted about these characters' deepness (Except Goose the cat). On the other hand, Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden made a great job about directing. Cinematography is good. Except some scenes visual effects are satisfying too. Captain Marvel is not on top 10 MCU movies for me but it's fun, it's worthy to see in theatre especially if you are a fan and waiting for Endgame because it has a mid credit scene which is gonna blow your mind.Ps: It was great to see relationship of Goose and Talos. These type of conversations was in comics between Rocket Racoon and Carol's cat.",7,1,4,9 March 2019
Rocky V," WORST ONE OF SERIES
","This sequel's topic is awesome. It sounds great to watch Rocky as a mentor. But unfortunately, this is where movie screws. Storytelling is bad. There are some logic errors. As an example, where is Russian Drago after big fight against Rocky? Or how did Cane got the title after Rocky? Worst thing this movie have is showing us a amazingly stupid version of Rocky. For me, that character has improved us he is smarter than we think by beating up his challenger with his intelligence in third movie. And series are contradiction with each other at this point. Despite these, Rocky V has good parts too. I think Paulie has always been a very underrated character and in this movie he improved this to us. I really liked that. Although it is so ridiculous, final fight was meaninglessly satisfying. But these aren't enough for Rocky V to not being worst Rocky movie.",6,2,3,2 January 2019
Spider-Man 2," BETTER THAN FIRST ONE IN EVERY WAY
","Spider-Man 2 brought so much new stuff that they didn't have in first one. But in the same time, it kept doing very good things that first movie had. Almost every character is so well written; it is just enjoyable to see how movie understands these characters, especially Peter Parker. That's a story about lessons that Peter is learning and realising, just like first one. His insane character development proves how good they were at storytelling. Also it is still a powerful love story. But after all, the best thing this movie have is showing how people love and respect to Spider-Man. Honestly, I cried in train scene after seeing it few times. It was meaningful and intense. That's why I think Spider-Man 2 is one of the best superhero films ever made.",8,4,11,17 July 2019
Creed," CONLAN WINS THE FIGHT, CREED WINS THE NIGHT
","Lets be honest, Creed is so different from any Rocky movie. In the same time it is so loyal to first one. And it feels it is 6th's sequel, we can see the connection. Story is awesome, cast is amazing. Micheal B. Jordan looks so ambitious, as though he has Eye of the Tiger. His motivation is super duper great. On other hand, we have Tessa Thompson. Im so close to fall in love with her, really. Her character has well written. And absolutely, we have the big shot Sly Stallone. There are nothing to say about him. He is just a legend. But if I had to add something, I can say his acting is better than his young version. Being old has a positive effect on him. But in this movie, director is not Stallone, we have a different guy from other Rocky movies. He is Ryan Coogler. He is amazing, Im so thankful to him for making this world so better and creating another great story about these perfect characters. He proves Rocky franchise has built their own universe. There are lots of great references to earlier movies like chicken training, giving some screen time to Adrian and Paulie characters. I shocked when I realised Paulie is dead. He was the only survivor from first Rocky expect Stallone. But in the same time, I was expecting to see some characters like Little Marie or other children of Apollo Creed. Where are they now? Anyway, Creed has great fight scenes, technically they are perfect. And it has very inspiring training scenes. Also this movie has a great humour, I raised a laugh during the 'cloud' thing. Finally, best thing this movie have is making an incredible final fight and making whole movie is like a new solo movie. And worst thing it have is not creating a so intense villian. This is my second favourite Rocky movie so far. I cant wait for second Creed movie.",8,3,4,9 January 2019
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," RIGHT MOVIE, WRONG TIME
","Everyone wants to learn origin of a character like Wolverine on big screen but if we would saw that story before all the X-Men movies, it would be amazing. Because now, it doesn't make so much sense. Even I love Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, this movie is not great at storytelling. But it promise you a good time and some okay action scenes. On the other hand, it has some ridiculous things. But in the same time it has some humour in it.",6,1,3,9 July 2019
Aquaman," A HOPE FOR DCEU
","Aquaman is a good super hero and blockbuster movie. It is worth to see it in theatre. Although it has something original, we saw lots of cliches and similarities with other super hero characters and movies. What Aquaman did it first is creating a world under water and they did it alright. CGIs are really great. I liked it but sometimes you can easily figure out it is a visual effect because editors have to use these effects every time. And thats the hard part of the job. Even so this movie has the best CGIs in any DC movie for me. Also, Aquaman has a great action. Italy fight, submarine fight, big battle in Atlantis... Casting is great too. Momoa and Heard did a wonderful job on this project. But generally characters doesn't have tough motivations. Especially King Orm, he is not a so intense villian. On the other hand, film is so long. I think it could be better if it would be 15 minutes shorter. Another great thing Aquaman did it great is connection of opening and final sequences. It was enjoyable.",7,3,5,30 December 2018
Deadpool 2," SUPER-FUNNY SEQUEL
","Deadpool 2 is new adventure of Wade Wilson which has a cute drama, a 'family matters' thing, a few new amazing characters, millions of references, a story of becoming X-Man and an incredible mid-credit scene. This movie protected tone and sense of humour of the first one. Actually, it is not bringing so much new stuff. But it is a great sequel, I watched two time and jokes still made me laugh. The movie and the character are enjoyable.",8,1,2,13 July 2019
X-Men," FIRST
","X-Men is first superhero team movie in history. Also it is Marvel's first movie with a high budget. Movie is amazing about storytelling, especially in first one hour. I really liked the world they created. But then it becomes a bit meaningless and complicated. CGI's are good for 2000. Actors and actresses are awesome with their roles, every one of them. This film have some surprising scenes, especially with Mistique. Bryan Singer made a good job at all.",7,3,3,18 June 2019
Spider-Man 3," WORST OF THE TRILOGY
","Spider-Man 3 has cool moments, I really enjoyed some parts. But it becomes boring, especially in second half. It has some dumb scenes and nuances too. Also it tries to tell lots of stories and that is an obstacle for characters deepnesses. It could be so much better. A better finale for this trilogy would be amazing. Actually, it wasn't meant as a finale. Seeing Spider-Man 4 could be awesome too.Ps: That movie has some really touching moments.",7,1,9,18 July 2019
Ready Player One," A SCI-FI WITH FULL OF ACTION
","Ready Player One opens a door to a world which is so original and creative. OASIS has designed very well, if you ask me. But its story is a bit cliche and close to average. Visuality of movie is just great. You are watching it on two different perspectives . Also it has to be champion of the world on putting easter eggs in a movie. I didn't read the book but Im excited to read it after the movie. Best thing this movie movie has is, it serves you enjoyable 140 minutes without becoming boring. And the worst thing is, it always shows us these events in America. OASIS must be an incredibly important thing to the world. I would like to see reaction of whole world and maybe politics' too.",8,3,6,10 February 2019
Suicide Squad," DISAPPOINTMENT
","This is one of the worse superhero movies in 21st century. Movie cant decide its mood. It tries to be funny, sometimes serious and even sometimes dramatic. But it is nothing. A story like that goes slow everytime, cant believe this. Even in action scenes. But basicly, this project had a big potential. It is a great comic book event, has a awesome fiction, a diffrent Joker after Heath, a great Harley Quinn, big stars like Will Smith, colourful and diffrent characters... Movie's villian is worst part of it for me. My favourites about this film are musics, Batman's scenes and final scene. Because there are Batman and Joker, you know. Im sorry for you Leto; you are great, just not lucky.",5,1,1,26 November 2018
Taxi Driver," AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC
","What a masterpiece, what a beautiful piece of art, what a way of storytelling, what a character, what a performance by De Niro... I easily can understand why everyone thinks Travis Pickle is one of the best characters ever written in cinema history. Taxi Driver explains to cinephile what does 'character study' mean and how should it be done. 34 year old Scorsese put his vision on this and made possible every movie he did until today. Also, he inspired lots of storytellers and will inspire for ages.",9,0,0,23 December 2019
Rocky II," A DELIGHTFUL SEQUEL
","Opening sequence starts with final scene of first movie. That's great but I would prefer to see something more that we haven't seen in first one. Character motivations and seeing Rocky in a helpless situation are great. Sylvester Stallone shows us how his character changes. This movie is more humorous than first one. Also final fight sequence is more thrilling than first one's. Rocky II has a cute final moment. Finally; musics are great again, actors improve their characters and their relationships amazingly. It is a delightful sequel.",8,1,1,29 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," LEGENDS
","This movie is fun. Rami Malek is amazing. We can feel Mercury's gestures and moves, espacially on stage. Also film is so successful about showing great details. And it has a great voice editing and a good cinematography. But it has a problem with storytelling. I couldnt figure out, what story are we watching? Mercury's biography or Queen's? There arent some sequences I would like to see it. But Queen is a big band, right? Thats why making this movie is hard cause you have to make everyone happy.",8,2,2,11 November 2018
Justice League," NOT GOOD ENOUGH
","Justice League is not the movie that fans want. That is why it is not successful. Because studios are making these type of movies for make fans happy. But if we are talking about DCEU, no one is happy at all. Introducing of characters is bad. Actually we dont know anything about anyone. CGIs look so fake, sometimes it looks like a video game. Villian is simple and cliche, he hasnt got a motivation. On the other side, I liked Bruce's effort and motivation about putting this team together. Wonder Woman is wonderful again. Flash is funny, Aquaman is cool, Cyborg is complicated, Superman has a small part... But if I put aside everything, after credits scenes are giving me hope for future, both of them.",7,4,11,27 November 2018
Man of Steel," DC HAS MADE A GOOD START
","This movie is a good superhero movie, in the same time it has a great science fiction part. It goes fast everytime. Flashback sequences are awesome. There are some points which is not make sense like Zod's breathing on Earth. Also, even though movie's fast tempo is a great thing, in second part it goes so so fast and you cant figure out whats going on clearly and thats not cool. But I can say, Man of Steel is a great beginning for DCEU and Henry Cavill fits Superman role excellently.",7,2,3,20 November 2018
American Psycho," DUBIOUS
","American Psycho is a psychopathic movie, really. We have a crazy, dark and mysterious main character. Bale is awesome as Bateman. This character is such a deep person and every experience he goes through makes him deeper. Movie is so successful about making term descriptions and telling Bateman's mind. Also it goes in a serious tone and it makes us thrilled. American Psycho has bloodcurdling sequences. Story is not so clear, it left some questions behind of it. I think reading the book is necessary to understand everything better. I didn't but movie made me excited for reading it.",7,1,1,1 February 2019
Little Miss Sunshine," WARM AND HUMOROUS
","Little Miss Sunshine is such a fun movie. It felt so good. The story is sincere, characters are well written and atmosphere of film is so funny.",8,0,0,17 February 2020
The Shining," A MILESTONE FOR THE HORROR GENRE
","The Shining is one of the best films I've ever seen. I'm just in love with that masterpiece. Kubrick's vision, King's characters, Nicholson and Duvall's performances, the cinematography and atmosphere... This movie is just flawless. It becomes better in my mind every time I see it.",9,2,4,17 February 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," EVERYONE CAN BE SPIDER-MAN
","This movie is so successful about make us feel this motto and telling somethings like relationship of Miles and Peter, Miles' mind as a teenager and his improvement as a hero, Spider-Team event, such a great job on introducing so cool new Spider-Characters with same way without boring audience, make us surprise with showing Aaron Davis as Prowler, great and original animating, create an atmosphere like watching a comic book, emphasising Spider-Senses and personal problems of characters, amazing references to comics and other movies and popular culture... This movie has a lot great and special things like these. Also I appreciate it for paying respect to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko at the and of the movie. RIP legends... But this movie is not so laughing at all. It hasnt so many amazing jokes. And I think it is a bit overrated because lots of people say it is better than any Marvel movie so far but this is an idea which is beyond this movie. It is not because it hasnt a so intense villian or villian team. These characters are a bit recessive in story. Finally, I have to say something. I did a big mistake and watched dubbed version of this film. Maybe it is a reason for not finding it perfect. But I promise I will watch original version when DVD's will be dropped.",8,2,11,15 December 2018
Warrior," ACTUALLY, I'M GIVING 7.5
","This movie is good. But I still can't find out who is the real warrior, Brendan or Tommy? This movie have some amazing points most of fighting movies doesn't have. There are a good family drama, a simple leading character, a mysterious leading character and a disgusting supporting character. It looks like those characters have great back plan stories but I don't know why movie is not explaining properly. Also it is not amazing cinematographically, especially in fight sequences. Camera shakes too much. On the other hand, its main idea is just awesome. In the end of the movie, I just smiled. It was a enjoyable experience.",8,0,0,16 July 2019
Dangal," MOTIVATIONAL
","Dangal has Indian box office record of all time and it deserves it. It is the best biopic Bollywood can make. It has every quality Hollywood biopics have. Cast did an amazing job. Preparing this project as an actor is hard. Aamir Khan's transformation proves that. They brilliantly show us their characters' moods and reactions about every event they have been through. Also, Dangal has great descriptions about public and important social messages. I really respect that. I think it is almost a masterpiece but it miss that by a step. Best thing this movie have is showing us great character motivations and relationships. They made it nicely. Worst thing this movie have is telling wrestling's technical details so superficial. It shows something about that but it doesn't explain.",8,3,3,23 January 2019
Rocky IV," NOT AS GOOD AS FIRST TRILOGY
","Rocky IV is not as good as first trilogy because there are a lot of sequences that we got used to see. Why Apollo wants this match so much? He has already retired. There must be new ones to represent America. And he died! What the hell? This is not realistic and unfortunately it cant be so dramatic because it is ridiculous. Im sad about that. In first 3 movies, Apollo has written so well but in fourth one, he is nothing. Rocky's motivation is not Apollo's death either. He didnt even say anything about him after fight. But I must say something, even this movie hasnt got an intense main idea, final sequence has it. Even though we saw lots of unnecessary propagandas during the film, what Rocky said about politics and people were awesome. Also Rocky proved us something else. This sport is not just physical. Everyone is just human. If anyone want to get a victory, they have to be mentally strong. Sylvester Stallone does this alright in every movie; showing us 'Who is Rocky?' actually. Why this character is amazing and he inspires people so much.",7,1,1,30 December 2018
Spider-Man," ICONIC
","'With great power, comes great responsibility.' This is a film about how Peter Parker learned that lesson. Because of that and some scenes, this movie is so comic accurate. In the very first Spider-Man comic book, everything was about that lesson too. Also, in opening sequence of movie Peter says it is all about a girl. That's so true too! But about love, there are some stuff which is so cheesy in that film. Actually it has some more creepy stuff but in the great tempo and editing of the film they are not necessary to think about. Sam Raimi and writers did an amazing job on storytelling and introducing characters. Everything characters do have some reasons; we see what they do, why they do and connection between previous and next acts of characters. Cast is fantastic. I love Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, he is still my best hero because of my childhood. Also, there is someone who steals the show every time: J.K. Simmons. He is fabulous! On the other hand, there is something this movie have which newest Spidey movies don't: Iconic scenes. Remarkable things are happening in that story. Some of them lovely, some of them brutal and some of them exciting. Finally, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie is a good origin story which this character deserves.",8,1,7,17 July 2019
Dunkirk," POWERFUL
","No doubt, Dunkirk is Nolan's best cinematographic movie of all time. Colour palette and harmony are just amazing. IMAX shots assert it selves. Especially plane scenes are admirable. Also, movie looks so real. Great decor, real places, real bombs,planes, ships... Such a wonderful production. Musics are so intense and fit with visuality. Hans Zimmer of course! On the other hand, story is a bit complicated. Sometimes it feels so empty but sometimes it feels so intense too. I cannot say so much about characters and actors because Dunkirk goes a really different way about these and it doesn't even try to show us backgrounds of characters. Honestly I was waiting a little different things from Nolan on it. Even so, it is a great -real story- war and historical film.",8,2,3,3 January 2019
X-Men: Days of Future Past," BEST X-MEN MOVIE, NO DOUBT
","X-Men: Days of Future Past just blew my mind. It is amazing. I'm glad to have Bryan Singer on this franchise again, he made a great job obviously. Cast, characters, storytelling, action, editing, charisma, tempo... All of them are awesome. There are just so little few thing that I didn't like but they don't matter much. Also, final sequence was amazing too. No doubt, this film is the best one of X-Men movies.",8,1,1,11 July 2019
Yesterday," BRILLIANT IDEA, AVERAGE MOVIE
","Yesterday is a enjoyable and funny movie. It has an creative and lovely idea for making a movie. It has great characters. Story is okay for a while but in second half it becomes so cheesy. On the other hand, it is a amazing journey in to The Beatles' songs. It has some creative sequences which is lots of fun. Also, it is good as cinematographically. But this movie could be more than that at all.",7,2,5,28 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," THE END OF THE LINE
","Avengers: Endgame is the biggest superhero movie of all time. It is an incredible event of MCU and magnificent ending of Infinity Saga. Marvel has been doing great movies during years, as a fan I followed and watched all of them with interest. But this one, just blowed my mind. I remember my hands were shaking at final fight. No doubt, Captain America's line 'Avengers, Assemble!' has become the most epic line in MCU and this film has become the most epic movie in MCU. Except few things, everything is clear on my mind about Endgame and it truly satisfied me. I don't want to talk so much about each character and each scene because I don't want to give any spoilers. So I just want to thank all cast, Kevin Feige, Russo Brothers, Christoper Markus and Stephen McFeely, all directors and writers in MCU films but the most importantly I want to say that Im so grateful to Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko. Thank you 3000. Thank you Marvel Studios for showing us such great stuff.Part of journey is the end.",9,0,4,6 May 2019
Toy Story 4," IS THIS THE LAST TIME?
","What a final scene... You can just watch every Toy Story movie right now for watching final of fourth one. This film is lovely, I didn't want to leave the theatre. Visuality is just insane. If you ask me, it is worst feature Toy Story film but that doesn't mean it is bad. It is just not as perfect as first trilogy. On the other hand, it has a very different perspective on its story than any other movie in this franchise. I can clearly understand why Pixar made this movie after brilliant ending of Toy Story 3. Also, they still have something more to tell. There are new amazing characters like Duke Caboom, Forky, pelushes... But I didn't like new doll, which is a villain. Although, she got few scenes that were pretty great. Finally, I can say Toy Story 4 has best editing and visuality in whole series and it is worst feature Toy Story film. But I really enjoyed it.",8,0,4,1 July 2019
Climax," STRESSFUL
","Gaspar Noe did a amazing job about making us thrilled. Actually, that gets annoying and oppressive, especially in second part. We can clearly feel the hell ambiance but I didnt like it because it is too intense and not for everybody. I found long the opening TV sequence. But after that, dance scenes were awesome, director preferred this and some other scenes to record at once. Cinematography is good at all. Except dance scenes I didnt like first part of movie, it is just empty. Also storyline and characters are so obscure. Movie pushes the limits with sex content in dialogues but this gets so disgusting and rude.",6,5,15,3 December 2018
Wreck-It Ralph," A WORK OF GREAT IMAGINATION
","Wreck-it Ralph opens a door to a universe which hosts us everyday but we just don't know it. Although Ralph character is similar with Shrek and his world is similar to what we see in Toy Story, I think this movie is still so original. First of all, it has a point. And every time a animation comes with a good point, it become successful. Wreck-it Ralph is one of them. It has well written characters; such an amazing villain; a story with flow; incredible references and easter eggs like cola-mentos relationships, soldiers made of oreo, sonic, pac-man, mario, street fighter... Also it proves bad guys can become good and good ones can become bad. Or maybe we don't know them really. It becomes dramatic during the movie.",8,1,1,23 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," INCREDIBLE CINEMATIC EVENT
","After 5th time to seeing this movie, Im writing this review. Infinity War is not just a movie. It is a consequence of events in Marvel movies for 10 years. It is a huge responsibility to make a movie like this. Because it has to be a bridge of phase 3 and 4, considering MCU will be continued for years... Also this is a big comic book event and it has lots of characters. Russo Brothers and writers did a brilliant job on it. It is amazingly epic, it has action all the time, it might make you cry few times, it can make you extremely laugh, it makes you thrilled and surprised. Shortly, you feel a lot of emotions during Infinity War. Even if you didnt watch any marvel movie, it can blow your mind too. No doubt, it is absolutely one of the greatest comic book movies in history. Im counting days for Endgame.",9,1,4,3 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," TARANTINO CREATES A NEW UNIVERSE
","Even lots of people say that this movie has some tempo problems and it becomes boring, I don't think like that. I really enjoyed almost every minute of Tarantino's latest journey. I did know Sharon Tate's story before watching the movie. So, I just waited her death during last part. And I totally surprised! This film's name is 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' and we are watching an alternative version of our reality with a happy ending. Just like a fairytale! Cast made an amazing job just like everybody expected. Story did satisfied me and I liked main characters' adventure.",8,1,6,3 October 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," COULD BE BETTER
","X-Men: The Last Stand had more potential. If Bryan Singer continued for this film, it would be better. Even though, it has more and better action and fight sequences than previous films. Also it has some really really cool lines.I really enjoyed first part of the movie. But the rest of it wasn't great because they couldn't tell Phoenix's story. I like Famke Janssen on that role but the character hasn't written so well. Also some new characters are shallow like Angel and Juggernaut. But I liked Beast so much.On the other hand, it was shocking to see Xavier's death, Mystique's and Magneto's loss of their powers. But post credit scene confused me after these scenes.Finally, maybe the best thing this movie have is the relationship of Logan and Jean. And I really liked the way Logan killed her. But third X-Men movie could be more, because the idea of the story is amazing.",7,1,3,9 July 2019
The Lion King," A COMPLETE REMAKE
","This film's visuality is just insane. Everything is CGI but it look incredibly real and on some characters this real look becomes funny and I enjoyed that. Also it is loyal to original. On the other hand hand; like I said in title, it is a complete remake. It doesn't bring anything else new. But it is still fun.",7,0,1,3 October 2019
The Incredibles," AN ANIMATION MASTERPIECE
","An animation masterpiece of Pixar. One of the best superhero movies of all time. Everything is great about that movie. It is a classic, it always will be.",9,1,1,21 January 2020
X-Men: Apocalypse," ANOTHER X-MEN ADVENTURE
","X-Men: Apocalypse is biggest X-Men movie ever. But that doesn't mean it is the best. Making movies like that is so complicated. Big events, everything is getting destroyed, very powerful villain, lots of characters... At all, it had more potential. I don't know why but I said that for some X-Men movies too. There is one thing can't figure out, X-Men: Days of Future Past has directed by Bryan Singer and written by Simon Kinberg. It was amazing, the best X-Men movie for me. Also X-Men: Apocalypse has directed by Bryan Singer and written by Simon Kinberg too. But these movies are so different on satisfaction. Apocalypse isn't a deep character in that movie, actually he is so cliche. Magneto's decisions, some events and some dialogues are so meaningless. The movie is not so boring at all, it has cool moments but honestly I found boring some parts. On the other hand, cast did a great job. Also musics are great too. If you love X-Men, if you love superhero movies, you can enjoy it.",7,1,2,12 July 2019
The Imitation Game," WHAT A MAN, WHAT A MOVIE
","I wasnt know who was Alan Turing before seeing this movie. But now, I feel lucky to know him. The Imitation Game is one of best biographical movies I have ever seen. It is dramatic, thrilling, lovely, inspiring and the most important thing; it makes you smile... Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley act brilliant. Im not from a country which has joined WWII but during the movie I felt like my country did win the war. Also I have a new perspective for maths and homosexuality now.",8,1,1,28 October 2018
Cold War," A LOVE STORY WITH IMPOSSIBILITIES
","Cold War is a skillful film by Pawel Pawlikowski with a great cinematography. It has some scenes like postcards. He serves a passionate love story which has inspired from his own parents. That's so impressive. This movie is in 40s, in 50s, in 60s... It tells a process and an evolution of a couple in a historical time period. Tomasz Kot and Joanna Kulig are awesome on their roles. Also Cold War is so successful with its music and musical scenes. Finally, best thing this movie have is telling the story fluently and simple in just 89 minutes. Worst thing this movie have is there aren't any specific stunning sequence which can blow your mind or your heart, including the final. It was a cute final, I liked it but could be more impressive.",8,2,5,9 March 2019
Logan," AN EPIC FINAL FOR LEGENDARY CHARACTER
","Logan is an amazing journey and final film, I think it is a great final for both Wolverine and X-Men franchises. Unlike any other superhero movie, it has an attractive way at storytelling and cinematography. And it is one of the most realistic films in this genre. Its atmosphere and tone are just great for character. James Mangold has improved himself since The Wolverine(2013). He really understands the character and tells us how tired Logan is, how he cares about Charles and his indifference for other people. You can feel what Logan and Xavier have been through during years, movie successfully describes those and mutants situations in this universe, that's why storytelling is so well. Also it is enjoyable to see them in this situation, I mean when they at the end of the line. It has an epic and emotional final. Actually, I think it would be more effective on me if I wouldn't wait so long to watch it and learn he dies in that movie. Even though, I surprised so much when X-23 and X-24 showed up. On the other hand, movie have lovely details like X-Men's comics and action figures. Seeing Logan's reaction to those and seeing how people love Wolverine is nice. Finally, I want to thank Hugh Jackman for showing us his best on that iconic character for 17 years. He will never be forgotten as Wolverine.",8,1,3,12 July 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," HAVE EPIC MOMENTS BUT...
","Joss Whedon's second Avengers movie Age of Ultron is a good transition to new phase in this cinenatic universe. Im writing this review after seeing it 3rd time. No doubt, it is better than first Avengers movie visually. But if we talk about storytelling and deepness of event and new characters, especially after watching Avengers: Infinity War I can't say amazing things. It has so epic moments, especially I hyped so much at final. Tonight Im gonna watch Avengers: Endgame and I wanna thank Marvel Entertainment for making this universe so beautifully.Ps: James Spader is amazing as Ultron.",8,1,2,25 April 2019
Toy Story," MASTERPIECE
","Lets accept it, Toy Story is a creative masterpiece. Has a great cast, amazing visuality for its year, brilliant characters and a fluent story. Also it has great bonus features in its DVD. I am watching the whole series again. After that, I will see the fourth one. I am super excited. We all watched those movies when we were kids but when I watch it again as an adult, it realise there are something more in them. That is a good feeling.",9,0,1,28 June 2019
Toy Story 2," ACTION GOES ON
","Toy Story was a masterpiece. And I think Toy Story 2 was a masterpiece too! First one was more creative but second movie is funnier, have more action and have better bonus features in DVD. Also it has amazing new ideas too. I am watching whole series again before seeing fourth and I just want to thank everybody who participated in these films. What a great franchise!",9,0,2,28 June 2019
Rocky," WHERE IT ALL HAS BEEN STARTED
","This film's main idea is amazing. It inspires everyone who wants to reach their dreams. And character has written well about that because he is poor,lonely and he is a person who is trying to be 'someone'. That's why lots of people find something from theirselves in this movie and in this character. Sylvester Stallone plays his role amazingly. He acts like a loser and boxer. He fits Rocky Balboa character. Also he has made a good job as a writer too. He created a few great supporting characters like Creed and Adrian. Apollo Creed reminds me Muhammed Ali. Also I really liked the way Rocky and Adrian have met and started to dating. Other great things about this movie are its music and low budget. It is not even 1M dollars.
Just admirable.",8,3,4,29 December 2018
Rocky III," ANOTHER BALBOA ADVENTURE
","Rocky III has incredibly great things like watching Rocky different situations and moods, his relationship with his son, he proves to whole world he is smarter than people think. Mickey and Adrian characters have key roles in story. And Creed's motivation is great. Seeing Creed and Balboa together is great too. In the other hand it has big mistakes. Come on, what is Clubber Lang trying to do? What he wants and why? What is this hate? These are meaningless. After Apollo, he is not competitor I expected. Press conference sequence has so stupidly written. After all, every fight scene is amazing. Listening Eye of Tiger is fun and it has an effect on story. But finally Rocky III is weaker than first and second movie. Because it hasn't got something powerful in main idea.",7,1,1,29 December 2018
Joker," THIS PUTS A SMILE ON MY FACE
","It looks like Todd Philips has decided comedy is actually dead and he went in a new way of filmmaking. Joker movie is an amazing idea of his; take the famous villain who is an unsuccessful comedian -I think he know how someone fails in comedy- write a sad, traumatic, epic origin story for character with Scott Silver, get some inspiration from Scorsese's films, go to Warner Bros. and take some serious money, convince an amazingly talented actor for that role... With all that material, a visionary director can make an incredible art house/comic book movie and that movie can be one of the greatest ones of its year. Winning Golden Lion from Venice is a huge achievement. Also; if Joker wins some Golden Globes or Oscars this year, I wouldn't be surprised. Especially Joaquin Phoenix deserves as leading actor. He was brilliant.",9,2,3,28 December 2019
It Chapter Two," IT ENDS
","Honestly, I think this movie is better than first one by a step. I watched first one on tv and second one in a big theatre. Maybe it effected my joy I don't know but I found second one scarier. I think it is so long for a movie like this but it can tell its story. Furthermore, characters' come back is so good.",7,0,0,3 December 2019
The Lion King," JUST BEAUTIFUL
","This story is beautiful, soulful and inspiring. It is not just for kids, everybody has something to take from Lion King. Visuality is amazing, especially for 1994. Watching this movie again was so nostalgic and joyful.",8,0,0,3 October 2019
Parasite," WHAT AN EXPERIENCE
","Palme d'Or winner Parasite is a masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. That movie is so skilled. Screenplay is amazing, I think it is best original screenplay of 2019 next to Knives Out. It takes you inside of it at the beginning and then you can never leave. Cast made an incredible job. Actually I can't find any bad things to say about Parasite. It is great.",9,21,33,21 January 2020
Wonder Woman," DCEU'S BEST MOVIE SO FAR
","This movie has a good point, both in film and metafilm. Gadot and Pine are great. I really loved the fight scenes. Thats a good origin story. But sorry DC, Wonder Woman hasnt more anything. It is not better than an average Marvel movie.",7,4,6,27 November 2018
X-Men: First Class," BETTER THAN PREVIOUS X-MEN FILMS
","X-Men: First Class is better than I expected, actually it is the best X-Men movie till it has been released. McAvoy and Fassbender are just amazing. I liked their Professor X and Magneto portrayals more. Also, Kevin Bacon is a great villain. This movie answered lots of questions from previous movies but it made mistakes too. There are some continuity problems with some characters like Beast, Shaw, Emma Frost and Stryker. They appeared in a so different way in other movies. There is one thing that I didn't like, Magneto becomes an enemy. This part goes so fast and it didn't make any sense to me. Except this; I liked Logan cameo, musics are great, training montage is awesome... This movie has great visuality and action, it is a well written, good directed blockbuster. I really liked it.",8,0,1,10 July 2019
The Wolverine," THIS CHARACTER DESERVES MORE
","This movie has cool scenes, it describes Wolverine well, it has a great mid credit scene. Also seeing the story of Logan's return to being Wolverine is amazing. But storytelling is not so good, supportive characters are not intense and film has tempo problems. It becomes boring sometimes.",6,0,2,10 July 2019
Iron Man," SO CRAZY BUT SO REALISTIC
","After third time to seeing this movie, Im writing that review. Every time I watch it, I find another great things about it. Iron Man is a great origin movie. It has a enjoyable tone and great musics. Also it was an amazing start to a universe which is so much bigger these days. This story is a realistic and fluent piece of science fiction. Tony Stark has a incredible motivation and RDJ is just unbelievable. He becomes iconic with this character. Jeff Bridges is amazing too but Obadiah Stane's motivation is not so so well for me. On the other hand CGI's are great for 2008. Finally, I can easily say that Iron Man is one of the best MCU movies.",8,1,1,24 February 2019
Creed II," THE GREAT CONFRONTATION
","Creed II is 8th movie in Rocky franchise. It screams that it is a Rocky movie. Story is so predictable and disorganised. There are some cliches too. You can easily say: 'Oh, that was so familiar.' during the film. It is one step behind of my expectations. First Creed was better, no doubt. I would prefer to seeing Ryan Coogler as director. I said lots of bad things about it. So, is it not worthy to see it? Not, it is worthy to see it in a theatre or buying its blu ray for sure. It is better then some Rocky movies for me, including 3 and 4. Also, cast did a great job. Micheal B. Jordan, Sly Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Dolph Lundgren, Florian Munteanu... They all were amazing. It was a great experience to see Ivan Drago again in a different situation, facing with Rocky again, seeing his background story after the events of Rocky 4, his relationships with his son and wife... About Viktor, he is a better villian than Conlan in first Creed. But he couldn't be the greatest Drago. His father was more scaring and bigger than him. And their fight with Adonis was not so intense and brutal. But Adonis was still on fire, he was great. On the other hand Creed II is our last time to see Stallone as Rocky. This is so dramatic. Oh, final sequence was so dramatic too. It was a great ending.",8,3,3,14 January 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," EPIC BUT MADE MISTAKES
","If Zack Snyder and writers could be better on storytelling, this movie could be so so different. Because there are some great action scenes and this is a big comic event. This movie's biggest mistake is; it is trying to tell lots of storylines. No can do it in just 3 hours. It is really a big time for a film by the way. Also there are some unnecessary scenes that I didnt like it. Even though Batman and Superman have played awesome by Affleck and Cavill, Lex Luthor and Loise Lane characters has written so bad. I liked Amy Adams and Jesse Eisenberg's performances but they cannot tolerate ridiculous things. Also there are a lot of logic errors in movie. My favourite scene is Batman's fight with Luthor's men for saving Martha.",6,2,3,22 November 2018
Toy Story 3," BEST ONE OF THE SERIES
","Toy Story 3 is just amazing. I felt every emotion while I was watching a film about toys. It was epic and full of action. When I watched it as child, it was so cool. But now, I can realise every detail in it and it became so much better. Visuality and story are better than first two movies. Movie has a great villain. I really liked Lotso's back-plan story. Also, movie has an incredibly emotional ending. It is just perfect. By the way, Toy Story 3 is cutest prison break movie of all time.",9,0,0,30 June 2019
X2: X-Men United," BETTER THAN FIRST ONE
",X-Men 2 is a good sequel. I think it is better than first movie with one step. Its action and visual effects are better. New characters are cool and Mystique is still surprising me. But I think both of these movies had more potential.,7,1,1,18 June 2019
Deadpool," SUPER-FUNNY
","Amazing character, amazing movie, amazing cast, creative ideas, lots of fun, excellent editing... Fox totally made this one right. It is just everything you may expect from a Deadpool movie. Ryan Reynolds is the only one who can act as Wade Wilson as good as that.",8,0,1,13 July 2019
Green Book," MEANINGFUL, HUMOROUS AND REAL
","Green Book has two main and real characters. Movie successfully tells us characters' nature and evolution process. This couple has a great chemistry. Green Book promises you a friendship story, a journey film, 60s country mood, a musical, an intense main idea on racism, a backplan story about differences of a rich and a poor man, sincere and laughing dialogues, some sequences which is gonna make you smile and make you upset... Those are positive parts about movie. Of course I have something bad to say about it, even though it is short. Story repeats itself few times. We see similar sequences in a short while. Also I would prefer watch more about Dr. Don Shirley's family and his brother. That storyline mires down.",8,3,6,9 December 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," SAME ENERGY
","John Wick: Chapter 2 has almost everything first movie had. Visuality, choreographies, Reeves' performance... Also it is bigger now. First movie told a smaller story but this is international. Even though, first one was more effective on me by one step. Excited about 3rd, gonna see it soon.",8,0,0,19 June 2019
Incredibles 2," SHOW GOES ON
","Making a sequel for Incredibles is not easy, that's why it took so long. I really respect Brad Bird for waiting because of perfectionism. Incredibles 2 is a very fun movie, both for children and grown ups.",8,2,2,21 January 2020
The Breakfast Club," A CLASSIC
","Everyone compromises that The Breakfast Club has and its own atmosphere and ideas to tell. Movie has well written characters, especially John Bender. At the beginning of the movie, he is so complicated and incomprehensible. But when he explains his family, everything becomes more meaningful. Also every character has some specific traits and conditions. In the same time, every one of them is a teenager. That is what makes this movie a classic. But if I must clear, The Breakfast Club is not so successful about what it wants to tell.",7,1,2,22 January 2019
The Fighter," INTENSE
","This movie is more than just a boxing film. It has a tough family drama, a fight with obstacles, a fight with drug addiction, great written -real- characters... Casting choices are awesome. Especially Christian Bale is living his role. He is really similar to real Dicky. Also I liked Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams too. One of the best parts of this movie, Mickey O'Keefe is playing himself! It must be a great experience for him. Final fight sequence is so intense, I had trembled, really. But sometimes movie becomes complicated and obscure.",8,1,1,15 December 2018
