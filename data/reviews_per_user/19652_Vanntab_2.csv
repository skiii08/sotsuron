Scarface," Why it's so great
","It's really hard to explain what is so great about this flick, it surely isn't very thought provoking, but it has some of the best quotes ever. I think the character Tony Montana is just so over the top in his humor, language, and violence that I just can't help but to love the guy.",10,0,1,22 March 2003
Troy," Tripe would be more accurate
","Quite frankly, this movie should have used its computer graphics team to drop a nuke on the whole thing; it would have been far more entertaining. I was brave enough to let the insulting butchering of the Iliad myth go to look for something worthwhile, but, much like this film, it was a frivolous and doomed undertaking.My cynicism seemed endless when trying to critique this film nicely. From a seemingly uninspired cast to plodding character development, there was not much room for enjoyment. The mix of clich√© American heroism and a stubbornness to acknowledge cultures, aside from the odd American with British accent culture Hollywood seems to fancy, left me wondering when the fascist Hitler would appear on screen and be usurped by Achilles, apparently champion of all things egalitarian. Thankfully, that never happened, so I guess that results in a one star rating.Of course the eye-candy ever present in the film was enough to captivate those of the straight female and gay male persuasion, I would rather watch an episode of WWE Monday Night Raw if I wanted to see oiled up hard bodies in limited clothing (at least their acting is somewhat believable, and characters interesting.) So, since this review is less for me, and more for readers, there is another star.Of course there have been movies further down in the Hollywood waste basket than this, gaining the film one more star. All in all, if you enjoy rummaging around in garbage, you will love this film. If not, watch Braveheart instead, at least they can differentiate Scottish from British from Irish.",3,1,7,28 December 2005
