Skyfall," Skyfall, a stepping stone for the Bond movies to come.
","I watched Skyfall two days ago and decided I wanted to know the rating the movie got on IMDb and read a couple of reviews.I was disappointed to read a review that compared Skyfall with the latest Batman movies. I am an avid fan of both the Bond series and the Batman one and felt the review did not do Skyfall justice.The new Skyfall is exponentially different from the original series because times have changed, action movies are more 'explosive' and the means of achieving great graphics exist. I personally think Skyfall was a PERFECT third movie with Craig as Bond. The first instalment of Bond with Daniel Craig was a movie that displayed a 'rough' bond, one at the beginning of being moulded into a great agent. This third one shows that he has reached the point of filling in the shoes of such an agent, an agent of our era. You cannot compare it to the old Sean Connery movies because of the time frame.The best possible moves the directors made was to cast Ralph Finnes and Javier Bardem. Javier is absolutely amazing in his 'bad guy' role, combining the extreme 'silly' like qualities in the old villains of the old James Bond movies with the new idea of what evil is, something that has no reason but just takes pleasure in inflicting pain. At the same time the back story between Javier's character, Da Silva, and M is one that explains the motives of the antagonist.The elements of the old Bond movies inserted in Skyfall are purely amazing and triggered fond memories of the Bond agents that came before Craig. This battle between 'the old' and 'the new' was very well thought out and I enjoyed it throughly.All in all I thought it was a great film. Although the beginning of the movie seemed a bit 'staged' to me. But after the tragedy that falls on Bond right at the beginning I felt the movie really picked up and did a great job in keeping me in suspense.When you are an avid movie watcher it does come to the point where you can predict what will happen. If you happen to be like me try to view Skyfall as a stepping stone towards the future of the Bond movies. Let yourself think, 'why yes all the major plot lines were a tad predictable but the acting was top notch, the storyline pretty golden and the action was really amazing' I really do hope people will like the movie!!!!
