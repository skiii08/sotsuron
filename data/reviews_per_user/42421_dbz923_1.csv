The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Best Movie I've Seen In Years!!!!
","I have seen a great many films spanning from the 20's until present day. I can honestly say I've never seen a film like this in my life and I can only hope there are more like it in my lifetime. I am a hard person to please having 'seen it all' but this movie truly touched me in a way I couldn't possibly describe in words. Others may believe the film can be a little vague at times, but I believe it gives the viewer the ability to place themselves in the plot. This made possible because there isn't a single person who can't say they don't know what Charlie is going through to some degree. Those who feel the need to put this film down are only doing so because they simply can't grasp the true meaning of what this film is trying to portray. I hope if you feel this film didn't quite do it for you then I urge you to watch it once more. Surely everything merits a second chance as I am sure this film does.",10,2,4,20 October 2012
