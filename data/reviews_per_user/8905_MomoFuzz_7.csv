The Lobster," A surrealist observation of marriage and love
","What a strange, grim movie. Yet it was surprisingly enjoyable. Let's go over the surrealist aspects of the film first: if you're the type of person who wants logical explanations, realistic premises, or any kind of closure in a film, then this is not for you. The Lobster is relentlessly absurd, and it demands a lot more out of its viewers than most other movies.I love this kind of weirdness. Yes, the themes of this movie could have been explored in a more realistic and comprehensible manner. But we have so many of those already. I'm glad these kinds of movies can also exist.So is the message of this film about love? Kind of. It's more about the institution of love. We have no federally enforced love laws, but societal pressures can sometimes be just as powerful. Anyone who's been single for a long stretch of time, especially over a certain age, probably knows how weird and absurd people can be about relationships. How people get annoyingly nosy and how they assume things about single people. How desperate some singles can get. The Lobster is about all this garbage our culture puts on us regarding love and marriage. So yes, it's about love, but not at all a romantic movie.In fact, the bleary performances of the actors brought it down a few points below what I initially wanted to give it. I understand why they were directed like that. The Lobster's dystopia is full of people whose lives completely revolve around staying in these state-mandated relationships. These people are constantly miserable but don't even know it. While this was amusing in the first hour or so, it slowly started to falter as the movie stretched for another hour. I think some more cutting or performance adjusting would've done it good. As the humor faded toward the end, the nightmarish qualities of the movie got a little too real. Too bad 'Deadpan horror' doesn't work as well as 'deadpan humor.'",7,1,1,22 March 2020
Knives Out," Humorous and clever whodunnit
","Knives Out was a delightful experience from beginning to end. At first I assumed it would stick to the general conventions of the whodunnit, as the movie started with Agatha Christie style suspect interviews. But from there it diverted slowly into its own modern twists. As the stakes got higher and events kept getting stranger, I became both excited and apprehensive for the story's direction. Could the ending really tie up all these loose threads? How will Marta or Blanc resolve any of this?Several times I thought I had the answer. And then I realized I hadn't. This movie was really good at that: keeping me in the guessing game until the very end. It had this push and pull with the pacing so that I always felt like I was just one step away from solving the mystery myself, only to get to the final reveal and get blown away. It was just so satisfying.And the performances were great too. As humorous as Knives Out was, there were also some politically charged scenes. These things can get a bit awkward depending on the performance, but I felt it was handled with great wit and care. It helped that all the characters were written very well. While the Thrombey family were all entitled rich pricks, they each had their own special shade of entitlement that I found very amusing.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. All the beats and characters worked for me. Especially the star sleuth, Blanc. I would love to see more of his patient, observant style of detective work in the sequel.",9,5,10,16 March 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," How many spider-people are there?
","Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse is one of the best superhero movies I've seen in the decade. This new comic book style animation is extremely charming. The characters are charming. The main character has a great arc that allows us to journey with him and experience the growing pains of becoming a superhero.While most superhero movies are far too eager to get to the spandex costumes and explosive showdowns as soon as possible, in this movie Miles Morales spends most of his time learning to control his powers. We get to know him as a normal teenage kid and get to identify with him. It makes the final showdown so much more meaningful when it happens at the end.The one criticism I have of the movie is that I got pretty overwhelmed when all the spin-off spider characters got introduced. I was OK with up to 3, maybe 4 spiders. But I hadn't even heard of characters like Peni Parker or Spider-Ham, and they were kind of distracting in some parts. I didn't like that they took up screen time when I'd rather be looking at Peter B Parker or Miles Morales or even Gwen. But I suppose some hardcore fans would have enjoyed them.Also, this had the absolute best end credit sequence I had seen in any movie. Definitely keep watching to see some real good art.",8,0,0,31 March 2020
Midsommar," Gorgeous Slow Burn Horror
","Ari Aster may now be one of my favorite directors. His flavor of horror is deeply personal, and therefore absolutely gut wrenching. First in Hereditary, and now in Midsommar, he shows mastery in the mix of both human tragedy and grotesque horror to impart such stomach churning dread in every scene of his film. While some horror movies may be content to show us the demons in underground catacombs or the ghosts in big old mansions, Ari Aster's monsters have a through line directly to the characters' psyche. These characters demand the viewer to step into their mind. Empathy is the key to both these films.Midsommar is an exploration of that human empathy. How much are people willing to tolerate in order to have that sense of belonging? To be understood by anyone, even if by monsters? Midsommar is a slow film, but it doesn't mean that it isn't fascinating. It gives the film space to explore the layers of manipulation and psychological evolution that our protagonist Dani goes through. It does of course end with a traditional horror-infused bang, but the set pieces weren't my focus by the end. They even felt a bit superfluous. I mostly wanted to know more about this cult and how Dani was dealing with it. I felt like I was one of those anthropologists, conveniently watching and analyzing on the safe side of the screen.The cinematography and art direction were also just gorgeous. Who thinks to make a horror movie where everything takes place in broad daylight in the idyllic pastures of Sweden? Yet it worked. They nailed all the creepy, ominous moods and tensions. The sound design and editing carried many of these scenes and they were excellent.",8,2,4,12 March 2020
It Chapter Two," Just Another Clown
","I had high hopes for IT Chapter 2. I was absolutely dazzled by the first movie's aesthetic design and the dynamic performances of the child actors, glued together by what seemed like genuine friendship in real life. Chapter 1 also followed the novel's story pretty closely, with some adjustments in the interest of showtime and visual impact, which I thought worked well while still capturing the essence of the novel.Sadly, I didn't see any of that in Chapter 2. While the actors were good and Bill Skarsg√•rd once again shined as Pennywise, there were just too many broader flaws that could not be salvaged by performance. Too much time was wasted rehashing what we already understood about the characters. I felt like I was watching a 'discarded scenes' compilation from Chapter 1, repeatedly shoved into the Chapter 2 storyline. And because of this the adult characters' arcs suffered as well. Surely in 27 years these people would have experienced new fears, passions, and growth. But they all seemed like echoes of the children trapped in adult bodies, with the exact same personalities and fears. I think the creators tried far too hard to copy the success of Chapter 1, without really understanding why it worked. Although the explosive visuals and cute humor worked with the young main characters in the first movie, these things undermined the sequel. I simply did not find it believable that these grown adults' deepest, darkest fears were things like fortune cookie monsters and old lepers and the like.The ending was also extremely disappointing. I was looking forward to this because in the novel, the final battle was a dire, existential battle of determination. This one was a rather deflating and stale one. It turned Pennywise the 'eater of worlds' into yet another uninspired CGI monster. Seemed like that's where all the extra budget went into, unfortunately.",5,0,0,22 February 2020
Parasite," A movie that stays in your head for weeks and weeks.
","I've never seen a movie do all the things that Parasite does and manage to do them so well. It's a comedy, thriller, horror, and heist film rolled into one, meticulously directed and beautifully edited. It remains entertaining while dealing with heavy topics on the nature of class and wealth. While the movie takes some unexpected turns in tone, it never feels disjointed. Most importantly, Bong Joon-Ho has a way of relaying his social criticism in a nuanced manner, so that the theme of wealth disparity doesn't devolve simply into the poor vs. the wealthy narrative we see often in these types of dramas. Rather, he layers multiple shades of gray into the morality of characters, giving them humanity and therefore a stronger verisimilitude to real people in current society. It makes the movie's appeal universal.After watching the movie I was floored. It was the only thing I could think about for hours afterwards. Even now I keep discovering another layer of interpretation behind a dialogue or scene. And there is a lot to engage with when the film direction is so detailed. Each shot and each line of dialogue is a result of careful storyboarding and writing. Even the background details such as the brick walls and the litter by the Kims' basement are painstakingly styled and arranged by the set designers. And the result, at least in my summation, is a near perfect execution of a great film.",10,5,7,21 February 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Infinitely Rewatchable Action
","After my third viewing of Mad Max: Fury Road, I decided that it's only fair that I give it a written review. I don't often watch a movie multiple times like that. And when I do, I am often disappointed at how the emotions or the spectacles lose their edge a little bit. But with this movie, I still got goosebumps watching those precarious, mad action sequences in the beautiful barren desert landscape.Every single aspect in Mad Mad: Fury Road is screwed in so tight that the tension never drops from scene 1. The story is simple but compelling with lots of high stakes. The characters are also simple but the nuanced acting, especially from Charlize Theron's Furiosa, keep them from being standard cookie cutter action heroes. These action scenes seem to have been written with each characters' personalities in mind, and that's why they are so memorable.For example Furiosa is the ingenious one who comes up with plans and coordinates things. I can't imagine Max doing the set pieces that she does. He's the one who fights in close range with raw power, and the scenes for him are truly meant only for him. In this way, the action scenes can illustrate character and advance the narrative, instead of just being cool filler in between plot points. That's how a non-stop guzzoline fueled rampaging with metal music can be sustainable for 2 hours.This movie might be one of those rare ones that are just infinitely rewatchable. It's like a visual roller coaster. I can come back to it year after year and still expect it to be thrilling and fun. No other spectacle can match the physicality of the actual stunts with actual cars.",9,1,1,4 April 2020
