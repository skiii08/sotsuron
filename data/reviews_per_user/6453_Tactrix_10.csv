Despicable Me 2," Minions!
","This much like the first movie is a hilarious masterpiece. This time around Gru and his 3 girls are together and he starts out being on the legit side of things(seems he's retired from the villain game). When out of nowhere he's summoned by a secret agency that tracks villains and is asked to find a very specific one.Now I know the title covers my utter love for minions but I seriously cannot stress enough how much I enjoy them. If they made an entire movie out of nothing but minions I would be on cloud 9, but the makers of the entire Despicable me series are pure geniuses when it comes to both comedy and timing. This is one of the very few animated cartoons that I can truly say is not cheesy.They've managed to capture the magic of a fantastically funny world without taking away anything from any age group. I absolutely adore these movies and recommend them to EVERYONE. 10/10",10,1,1,1 August 2013
Men in Black 3," Eh.. I guess
","MIB III, so after the previous adventures of agent J and K a alien that K put away 40 years ago breaks out of prison and goes back in time to try to stop K from putting him away and as a result taking over the earth.Now what you must understand is that this move had a lot of potential. There was a decent amount of fighting in different places some witty references, all around just the goofy fun you would expect from this series. However I don't feel that it lived up to the rest of the series it just seemed like there was a little too much whining and not enough actual witty banter to even out with the rest of the series and as a result it kind of made it monotone in comparison. Still great performances where they could have been done but not up to my standard. 5/10 because thats how I felt about it.",5,5,9,27 May 2012
The Hateful Eight," Trash
","Come on Quentin, you can do better, I know you can. I saw reservoir dogs. This movie while comical in essence is about a decade late in when we were still entertained by 8 people dribbling none sense for 2 hours. The acting is top notch for 90'/early 2000's, which is exactly what I imagine he told the actors to act like for the duration of this movie. Kurt Russell resembled a drunken version of what he once was in tombstone. Samuel Jackson resembled what he once was in basic. And the other actors just pretty much followed in lockstep with them.The story was disappointing, that is not to say that there weren't any entertaining parts, of course there were. However the general movie just felt like an overall waste of time. And what's with the nailing the door over and over again shut? They couldn't just use those same pegs to make sides by the door and then put a stick in between? I mean you have to figure at least 1 of out 8 of them has to have a brain cell considering at least 3 of them were in the army. 2/10 because come on, phoning in it like this is disgraceful. I don't care how many good movies you've made, there is no excuse for this piece of crap. Oh and 1 more thing why didn't he title it 'The H8ful' it would have been much better for promos.",2,99,208,26 December 2015
Suicide Squad," Directors Butchering
","The movie, I can't tell you much that you haven't already seen in trailers, because basically that's the whole thing. Now here are some things you should probably know, the acting in this movie was awesome, everything else however was awful. Now here's what seems to have happen. They shot something like 4 hours worth of footage, combined it was possibly one of the best versions of suicide squad that could have been made. Now here's what happen after that, the director cut that movie to shreds, but it doesn't stop there, he actually rearranged the cut parts of the movie to make it seem like a completely different movie then was shot. So now you have a terrible movie that was once a good movie that is now a clutter of moments out of order that seems like absolute chaos. If you're wondering why I'm giving this movie a 5/10 it's because the acting was THAT good. They can very easily save this movie from itself, just release the directors cut on DVD, the full 4 hours, and pray that everyone forgets about the stitched together abomination of a movie you attempted to show in theaters.",5,2,4,9 August 2016
Watchmen," Quick and to the point
","I could give you a long explanation like everyone else but being someone who didn't read the book before seeing the movie heres the real breakdown. First 10 minutes awesome, next hour and 10 minutes boring, everything after that all the way to the ending fantastic, this has a lot of end of the world meets Confucius stuff besides that the fight scenes are awesome.Finally this movie is for everyone its a solid plot line good acting and definitely scenery worth seeing. It is pretty long so if your going to watch this movie clear your afternoon.",8,2,5,3 July 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Revolutionary
","Yes this movie was truly a mind boggling experience and by that I mean a complete waste of time, not only did it not have a plot but it had nothing else that would even remotely be depicted as interesting.Essentially this movie was about a man who made a 'PsyOps' unit who's purpose was to use their powers to end war without confrontation, however this unit had no powers, it was just a bunch of people doped up on drugs and after watching this movie I wish I were as well, at least that way there might be a possibility of seeing a hallucination that resembles a shred of an honest to god plot line.Final thoughts, if you can skip this movie entirely, if not bring your cellphone or any kind of entertainment feature you will thank me for it!",1,11,22,13 January 2010
Foxcatcher," Horrible doesn't quite do it.
","This movie was so bad it deserves a review. First let me say I like rating movies based on acting, plot points, and general atmosphere. Baring that in mind this movie was something that I recommend skipping no matter the alternative. I wish I could tell you about acting but there was none, the few parts that had speech took all of three seconds and the rest of it was a blur of pointless events. If they wanted to make a documentary about a wrestler why didn't they just say so? Making people waste time like this should be against the law. Now on to plot points, there were none. Wrestler is coached by brother, he leaves brother to try on his own, fails, trains with brother again, and then leaves. That's it, that's the whole movie. This is one of those things where someone will try to tell you that a blank canvas is art, don't be fooled it's just blank canvas. 1/10 simply because there was no lower marks.",1,10,28,26 January 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," So close, yet so far
","Let's start with what the movie does right. It has beautiful cinematography and acting. And I do mean BEAUTIFUL. The camera work is on point, and you really couldn't ask for a better crew to do the job that they were asked to do. Now with that said why did I give it a less then stellar review? Because Tarantino while being a great director wrote a plot that I can only describe as incomplete.Let's break it down, I understand the story between the stuntman and the actor. But what in holy hell was the point of putting Margot Robbie in this movie? I'm being serious, why? She served absolutely no purpose in this movie at all, she did nothing. She took up like 20 minutes of screen time and in those 20 minutes not 1 second was spent on anything even within the realm of possibility of being close to relevant to the plot of the actual movie. The remainder of the time you had Brad and Leo doing there thing, and while it was interesting in its own way to watch it had absolutely nothing to do with Margot.So yea, this was 2 hours and 41 minutes of my life that basically can be summed up by saying you made a movie about a guy who was an actor and tried to stay relevant. He had a buddy, and they lived next to movie director and his main squeeze. Point? There is none. So you get a 4/10 and what do you get that for? 1 for Margot, 1 for Brad, 1 for Leo, and 1 for Great Cinematography. The other 6 is what you would have gotten had there been an actual plot to this movie.P.S. if you're on the fence wondering if this a good movie ask yourself this one very simple question. 'If anyone else released this film would they ever be allowed near a script again?' The answer is no, no they would not. In fact if anyone else had written this script they would have been thrown out of Hollywood.",4,0,4,26 November 2019
Unknown," The Name Does It Justice
","Having seen Liam Neeson in Taken I was expecting much more I must admit going into this movie it was unfair of me to assume it would live up to the hype of the other one. I didn't however expect to be disappointed this badly, the entire movie is him running around trying to piece together whats happened in his life and how he got to where he was in the very beginning, in the meantime the only action you see are a bunch of people chasing him in failed attempts. This was not riveting, not suspenseful and least of all entertaining. If you wish to waste your time watching a man run through a city for hours by all means watch this movie, otherwise do the smart thing, skip it, and watch something more appealing. Like just about anything else.The acting wasn't terrible too bad it couldn't make up for the atrocious plot. At some points you just want to walk out, yea that feeling never really goes away, in fact the first time you get the urge by all means go with it, you can thank me later. 2/10 the scenery wasn't bad thats about it.",2,2,6,27 May 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Two Major Problems
","This movie was butchered but in a very specific way. First it became a silent film in all the areas where it mattered, that was a colossal mistake. They should have made Ana narrate everything she was thinking, kind of like they did in Dexter, but instead they did.. nothing. So what ends up happening is, all the moments that would be described in great detail with thoughts and feelings are left unexplained. Of course no one who's never read the books would understand what was going on.Now on to the second massive blunder, the reason why the book was so fluid and worked so well is because of the encounter context, as in we put these specific people here and then make this situation play out in a way in which it makes her seem insecure and quirky(not shy and sad). Then and only then does the situation make sense and works. In the movie they did NONE of that. They took creative license but instead of cutting a few parts they shredded them all and made the encounters bland and tense. Case and point in the first couple of minutes in the movie, there was suppose to be an internal dialog where she's weirder out by all the blonde women on the way in, there's an entire section that brings out her insecurity and really gets the people to feel the emotion but instead there's none of that. They just skipped it entirely and went on with the movie.Bottom line this is just bad writing, whoever butchered this script needs to be fired and replaced with a person who understand the concept of writing, and can actually execute it without being held by the hand and directed around the playground like a child. 6/10 because the acting was pretty good despite the god awful script.",6,1,3,28 February 2015
