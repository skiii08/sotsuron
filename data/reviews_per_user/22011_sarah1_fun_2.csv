Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas Does it Again!
","Reading other reviews, shows that many people didn't like this movie. It isn't that Lucas didn't make a good movie, it's that when these people saw the original starwars they were kids. Now they are adults and still they expect the same rush. They don't seem to realize that they aren't 12 any more. I am a teenager, so I wasn't around for the originals. I watched them when they were released and I loved them. Now a year later, the Phantom Menace comes out and I loved it. It is because I am not expecting more than any movie can give. I went to this movie not expecting a miracle, but expecting two hours of fun and this movie delivered. People seem to want to watch the original again. Anything else won't be good enough. They have to realize that this is a different movie and a diffrent story. So no, there is no Han Solo, no Empire, no Princess Leia and no Luke Skywalker, but there is equally interesting characters and an equally interesting storyline. I recommend this movie to everyone!",10,0,1,7 August 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Not worth the hype
",This movie was overrated. All the fuss wasn't worth it. The movie for some reason was loved by critics while audiences seem to find it rather slow. The acting was nothing to write home about and the story lacked at places. This movie was perfectly watch able but wasn't as good as I was led to believe it would be.,6,3,6,24 July 2000
