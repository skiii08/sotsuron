The New World," Disgusting
","This movie was horrible.It took a genocide and made it look like a sappy love story.I'm also very disappointed in the way that 'Rebeca' seemed to be so happy with her new life. If only she knew what was coming to her people.I'm really not convinced that the writer of this film did any research.It reeks of the idea that western civilization was superior to that of native Americans.And generally, it was just bad filmmaking. Not moving at all. Tons of long shots, and the dialogue that did happen had no content.",Null,0,2,13 March 2011
