Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Live up to all my expectations
","Well I have had a lot of expectations before going to the theatre. I had said to my self that what i wished for the movie was that it had to be in the same spirit as other Star Wars movies. And I was not let down. It IS a great Star Wars Movie. Nothing unexpectet. The Star Wars movies is a fairytale. That is was it always has been. That is what I love about Star Wars. It is childs dream coming true. If you remember the dreams and hopes you had when you was a child you know what I mean. It´s true if you try to analyze the movie as an normal movie it´s not more than an average movie except the special effects ofcourse. But that´s not what it´s all about. You have watch the movie with a child eye. Then you know what I mean.Thank you Mr. Lucas for this great fairytale, look forward to the next Star Wars movies.",9,7,9,18 August 1999
