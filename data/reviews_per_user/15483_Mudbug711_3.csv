Lucky Number Slevin," Please, enough already!!
","I, as a real fan of almost all genres of movies (except for horrors, and stupid teen comedies), I am sick of hearing why you people give your negative, pessimistic reviews of movies you most likely knew in advance, that you would not like anyway. You start watching the movie with a darn pessimistic screwed up attitude, thinking that Tarantino is the damn greatest director, and if he is not making the movie, it will definitely suck!!! You don't have to tell me that I am darn close on this. I have close friends that are that way, and they, as well as you all, have your right to your opinion. But some of you, really like to shove your opinions down the throats of others, for you believe your words are gospel. In this movie, you have not 1, not 2, but 3 of the greatest actors in this world. Morgan Freeman by far, is one of the most respected actors of Hollywood. That man can sit in front of 200,000 general people, and read a local phone book, and he will have every one of their undivided attention. Sir Bill Kingsley, to me is very underrated. You need to see, 'Searching for Bobby Fisher' if that is you can watch it, there is no nudity, nor stupid comedy, such as someone running into a bus on a bicycle, or a bunch of wet T-shirt bimbos running around. Then, of course there is Bruce Willis. I need not to say much about the man, that darn near all red blooded Americans know already. Then there is the very up, and coming Josh Hartnett. I imagine all hormonal females loved the towel thing. The part I admired the most -- had to be the part played by Lucy Liu. I was not a big fan of Lucy Liu, until I seen her play this part. Why? I don't care for the roles she had played previously; which were almost all Miss Betsy Badass........so damn pass√© of today.....yawn. In Lucky # Slevin, she plays a human female, with real emotions. She was cute, warm, funny, and entertaining. Next, was Stanley Tucci. Great act from him, as always. Now the part I am really burned up on, is the person(s) who stated the movie was predictable... First off, let me guess you are fan of Tarantino, right? Next, let me see............ You work in the carnivals guessing the weight of people, and you are damn good at.........let me see, the government has contacted you on numerous occasions to help them, because you can predict anything, right? Stupid, right? Just like you saying this movie was predictable. I have not found anyone personally yet, who has not given this movie anything lower than a 6/10. I as a real fan of movies, not of just one genre, not of just one, or two directors/producers/writers/actors, not of just nudity, not of just action, not of just violence, not of just car chases, etc., etc., etc.. I am a FAN, a BUFF. I will see a movie for what it is worth, not because I want to sound cool, by being pessimistic. Maybe you really feel that way, then again... maybe you don't. But, to me, and everyone I personally know, this was a great movie.... mind you, not perfect, not even close, but damn good. That is why I am giving this movie, with a terrific cast, good script, and set. A movie that kept you guessing--- an 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,19 September 2007
Cloverfield," Ahhh, here we go again!!!
","Now this was a very hyped movie. Yes it was. I believe it was when I went to see Transformers, that I seen the teaser trailer. My friend, and I were a little surprised by the short action scene, and then a date appeared... and that was it!!! No title..nothing. Got to admit, this of course had a lot of people trying to figure out about this movie.I went to the theater, KNOWING that this movie was shot in VERY REALISTIC way, by someone running around with a camera filming the movie like they were actually there!!! So, I was expecting a SHAKY camera. I went to this movie, expecting a movie that had real life scenarios, and situations...not just a mad, crazy, powerful monster on the loose. Grant it, that was the main thing, but like in real life, other things matter. There was some-what of a plot.. not very strong mind you, however there was a plot. That was the courage for one to go out of one's way, in the face of unrelenting danger, to attempt to save another. Sounds sappy, but it does really happen. The acting was strong, the cast was mostly upstarts, but good. The NYC backdrops, and scenes were great. The monster was awesome, and VERY original. The camera work was spot on, makes you feel like you were right there!! I really liked that, the sense that you part of the situation itself.So, let me say this.. You should not really compare this movie with Blair Witch.. I liked Blair Witch, but originally, the Blair Witch movie folks (storyline) tried to make you believe that was actually a true story...remember??? This movie (Cloverfield), we all SHOULD know is FICTION!!! I give this movie a 9 out of 10, for the originality, and cinematography. Good work, folks. I was impressed!!!",8,1,4,28 January 2008
Watchmen," Please, don't criticize what you don't know....
","I am asking anyone who wants to go see this film, to PLEASE familiarize yourself of the storyline, and characters before you see it. It has a very deep story, very complex characters, and not for the soft-hearted. This story came from a comic novel. It us unlike the superheroes that you have heard so much about.I ask you to either or both read the novel, or watch the DVD Watchmen: The Motion Comic. All 12 chapters are on the 2 disc set, and it will give you all the perspective of the movie, you will not be lost. OR, at the very least go to all the websites that are supporting the movie, and read of the main storyline, and characters.I don't see how people can criticize something, so badly, that they nothing about. All they seen on the trailers was costumed people, and action sequences, and thought that it was going to entertain them. However, they did not see the big, huge letters on the screen pointing out it was from a graphic novel.That is just my assessment, and opinion. I just hope folks heed it..to some degree. This is a very good story. Not a ton of action, but still very very good.",Null,3,9,5 March 2009
