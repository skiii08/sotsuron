The Avengers," A delight to watch
",Well this was certainly a much awaited movie of this summer.I had a lot of expectations from it and it delivered even more.My friend had no knowledge of Avengers and he went out with me.In the end he clapped with the audienceNow about the movie Just one word to explain it its 'entertaining'.Its a long movie but it kept us stick to our seat.I din't realize when it ends .The strong point of this movie is its humor.Every characters are funny in their own way esp. Tony Stark.Don't want to tell you the story You yourself watch it.Watch it even if you are not a comic man.You will enjoy it,10,14,28,28 April 2012
Gravity," One of a Kind Experience
","Well where to start. Heard a lot about this movie and read a lot of good comments about this movie so wanted to watch it desperately. So finally watched it and it was an excellent experience for me. I have never had such an experience before. People drifting in space, fighting for survival all these scenes enthralled me. The story of the movie is very simple but don't want to tell you. The experience is very different. I am sure you have not have experienced anything like it before. So if you are planning to go for this movie watch it in 3-D only and don't wait for DVD watch it in theatres only. This is the type of movie which is made for theatres only.",9,7,10,31 October 2013
Rush," Watch it Enjoy it
","I went to the theater without making my mind.This movie was the earliest show so I went to watch it. Trust me I was thrilled. Its brilliantly made. Solid performance by both the main actors. You will remember Niki Lauda after this movie if you don't know him before. I googled about both the character after watching this movie.I am myself not a fan of formula one but I was thrilled every time there was a race in the movie.This movie is based on the real story.This movie is about rivalry, passion and self belief.I am not going to give away the story .All I want to say is watch it yourself and enjoy. You don't need to know about formula one or about any of the characters before.",10,2,5,24 September 2013
