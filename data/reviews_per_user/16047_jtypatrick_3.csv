Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Better if you do not read the book
","Very enjoyable and great acting and action. I enjoyed Abraham Lincoln, I found it hard at times because so much was different from the book. What was most odd was Seth Grahame- Smith Wrote both. It is like he decided to take his idea and write a whole new story with that idea. I think Tiur did a good job directing not sure if he was the best, but did a good job. THe concept of the film is how serious do you want this story to be, it walks a thin line. My wife enjoyed the film , as I told her what was in the book, she wished that the had kept to a lot of those stories. The film was beautifully shot the LA scenes were my favorite. Much of the history that was in the book has been left out as well.I feel this movie would have done much better had it been released in October it is not a real summer type of film.",6,2,4,24 June 2012
Prometheus," answers?
","Review.  I'll make this short. I feel with the hype and talk Prometheus didn't deliver. I wanted more story. It creates an Interesting mythology. I like it was original in the alien universe. I think there was more to explore. My questions I ask are , why did David put the black goo in the drink? Why the squid that grew In Her? I think it should have been her that birth what would become the first queen. Why did the infect/in pregnant her in the first place? Why did the engineers ' leave star maps' to that planet if it was a military lab, they were creating this goo, creatures to kill us? The captain came that conclusion to easily.  Why were there no weapons for defense on the ship? What killed the engineers? Only one survived in the pod, and he was in there 2000 years. Why didn't they dissect the dead bodies?  I feel like parts that should have been explained and they should have investigated. If the engineers had spoken to David that would have been Interesting. I won't go into the characters. There wasn't enough horror for me to classified it as such It would have been neat if that was the engineers home world, destroyed by their creation the xenomorph. Something thicker , I would prefers the movie stay original not try to tie in alien. There are more questions in my opinion of how we got to Alien. The opening of them discovering the painting was short two short. It was over to quick. There could have been more from the archaeologist point. And there is never any conclusive evidence that they created humans. I don't feel there was a twist in the ending. The film need either less alien prequel or more alien prequel.   I want to see a sequel, help answer and understand the questions this movie tried to raise and answer. There feels like there's more to tell to get us to alien and to understand this story. I would have preferred not the ending we got with the first xenomorph. It doesn't make a lit if sense. we rushed to make that happen.  I feel let down and like the characters wanting answers?",6,2,6,9 June 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Missed opportunity
","The Cohens are great. The actors were great. But the story didn't go anywhere and the story could have been so much more. The music is great there's tinny subplots and odd events. The characters move together but not much is done. What's the point? The main character has a very little arc and he's a dick to everyone. So much more depth about the power of music and what if does to those that believe in it and play it. I do t have a lot to say I'm now typing tower the minimum.. I say I u want to to see it get it from redbox. Ur not wasting much money and at least the music is good. The movie feels longer then what it is. T bone Burnett does it again. Nice supporting cast could have used more of them.. I found myself bored at times, the beginning is the end thing made little sense. Why did we need it? We didn't find out who the dude was, right? I don't know I like music and the actors.",5,1,1,14 March 2014
