The Blair Witch Project," Ignore the hype and enjoy the movie
","Just to get it out of the way, this movie was NOT the scariest thing I've ever seen, the footage WAS nauseating to watch at times, and the dialogue was often limited.That being said, Blair Witch is a very creative movie, with the ability to get the adrenaline pumping as you watch it.  The tagline gives away the ending - after all, only the footage was found, right? - but I was still at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.Many of the people leaving the theatre were complaining that it was boring, and that they expected a real 'horror' film.  If what you're looking for is 'Scream,' this isn't it.  Instead, it relies on creating a mood for the audience that encourages you to try to imagine yourself in the characters' places.  As for the dialogue, I thought it was extremely realistic, if not terribly original.  The acting was superb.  I found myself getting angry with Heather as she pranced around with her camera, and during the scene where they start to lose it at Mike, I could REALLY imagine the feelings they were having.If you haven't seen Blair Witch but plan to, just sit back and let the movie take you, and you'll probably enjoy it.  Just ignore the hype, as it really is overblown.",8,1,1,30 August 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Was everyone watching the same movie as me?
","I am shocked to see so many negative comments about 'Life is Beautiful.' I was mesmerized by it, and think it is the best movie I have seen in a long, long time.  Many people on this site have criticized the film for 'making light' of the holocaust.  'Life is Beautiful' certainly didn't lead me to think that the holocaust 'wasn't so bad.'Sure, a lot of the movie was not believable.  It didn't have to be.  I thought the whole point of it was to show that, despite the atrocities, people persevered through small acts of bravery.  For anyone who wants to compare this movie with 'Shindler's List', don't.  They are both spectacular, but they are two very different films.  Benigni doesn't hit you over the head with the horrible conditions in the camp.  Instead, he implies a lot, and focuses instead on the love of a father for his family, and his intense desire to protect them.  If some aspects of life in a concentration camp are portrayed as less severe, I don't think it detracts from the film's message at all.Instead, the most frightening aspects of the holocaust are shown in the faces of the characters.  Recall the scene where Dora learns that the children are to be killed.  Or where Guido discovers that the doctor is not interested at all in helping him, but is concerned with a riddle that he would like Guido to solve.  When Dora is sorting the clothing of the older Jews who have been murdered, I kept expecting her to come across the clothes of Guido's uncle, and from her face, I think she did too.  It is a credit to Benigni that he didn't go for melodrama in this scene, but instead focused on Guido's message to Dora over the loudspeaker.I think too often we tend to focus on what happens to people instead of how they deal with what happens to them.  This movie made me feel more angry about this part of our history than any other film I've seen, but it also made me feel very hopeful.  Benigni, without detracting one bit from the horror of what happened to them, makes heroes out of victims.If you haven't seen this movie, SEE IT (in its subtitled version)!  But if what you see is a 'comedy' about the holocaust, then you're missing the point....",Null,1,3,17 August 1999
The Iron Giant," A simple story with a great message.
","What a pleasant surprise this movie was!I missed it in the theatre, but after hearing so many positive reviews of it, I was happy to pick it up at the video store last night, and I was not disappointed.This is a simple story with a very strong and definite moral: 'you can choose who you want to be.'  What a great statement for a movie to make!Do yourself a favour and see this one.  I generally enjoy kids' movies, but this one is a particular favourite of mine.  I haven't seen one I liked this much in a long time.",Null,0,4,25 November 1999
