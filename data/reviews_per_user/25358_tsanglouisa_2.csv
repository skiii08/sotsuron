Hereditary," Cast is not convincing, and strange. I like the acting of the mother though.
","I haven't finished the movie yet but I would like to add this comment before I forget. First of all, the kids, they are unattractive, even as in a horror movie where cast is supposed to be a bit quirky. Charlie is obviously not a kid, and not a kid of 13. At first, I was thinking there was a twist to it, and until she's dead, there's none. I thought she was just a person who never grew old, and her grandma might somehow had replaced a dead grandchild with this 'kid' for her daughter, etc. But no, she's just a ordinary strange kid that might be in communication with the dead grandma that they had to finish some kind of rituals together.",6,3,6,9 September 2018

","Also, is the son Indian? He doesn't look like the son of either one of the parents and not to mention both of them. I really hope there's a twist to all my doubts in the end. I just have to continue watching. My bad!",6,2,4,9 September 2018
