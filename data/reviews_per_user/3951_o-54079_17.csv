The Avengers," An excellent movie
","In my opinion, is the following, although the premise is developed in a great way, giving shape to a somewhat simplistic plot, as I said the film does not redefine any way a plot that we have not already seen before, despite the fact that represents such concepts much better than any other film in its genre. However, although imperfect, the film satisfies at all times, and the scale between hits and misses is good enough to make this an excellent movie",10,0,0,18 March 2020

When faced with the boggart, the greatest fear is fear itself. In the face of fear, escape is useless, only true happiness, strong positive energy, can resist. There is no shame in acknowledging vulnerability, and one of the signs of not being strong enough is not being able to face up to it.",8,1,1,21 March 2020
